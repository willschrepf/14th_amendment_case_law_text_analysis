Truth alleges violations of the Equal Access Act (the\nAct), the First Amendment rights of free speech and expres-\nsive association, the Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment\nClause, and the Equal Protection Clause. We have jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We reverse and remand.\n\n                               I.\n\n   This appeal arises from Truth’s attempt to form a student\nclub at Kentridge High School (Kentridge), which is part of\nthe Kent School District. Under the relevant policies at Ken-\ntridge, “[u]nchartered clubs are not permitted to exist.” To\nobtain a charter, students must submit a proposed charter to\nthe Associated Student Body (ASB) Council and secure\napproval.\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12447\n   Beginning in the fall semester of 2001, appellants Undis,\nthen a junior, and Stewart, then a sophomore, attempted to\nform a Bible club at Kentridge. Undis and Stewart submitted\na “Club Charter Application” (first charter) for official recog-\nnition as an ASB organization in September 2001. This first\ncharter indicated that the club’s name was to be “Truth” and\nthat the purpose of the organization was to “have a Bible\nstudy to encourage and help become better people with good\nmorals.” Under the section “Membership Criteria,” the first\ncharter indicated that the group was to be “[o]pen to anyone.”\nThe charter also proposed that it would designate a “quote of\nthe week for announcement” and “once a month decorate\n[the] school with a theme.”\n\n   The ASB Council discussed Truth’s first charter at a Sep-\ntember 2001 meeting, and several students objected to char-\ntering Truth. The ASB Council decided to consult with the\nAssistant Principal, appellee Eric Anderson. Anderson and\nappellee Mike Albrecht, Principal of Kentridge, later told\nUndis that they would speak with the school’s attorney\nregarding the legality of granting Truth ASB recognition.\nAlbrecht stated that “the problem with the September 2001\nproposal was that it involved broadcasting a weekly Bible\nquote over the school’s public address system and monthly\ndecoration of the school in a biblical theme.”\n\n   No action was taken on the first charter for the remainder\nof the 2001-02 school year. During that time, Undis asked\nAnderson to make a decision on Truth’s application on at\nleast ten occasions, to no avail. Sometime in the spring semes-\nter of 2002, all ASB clubs were instructed to resubmit their\ncharters. The record does not reveal any further activity on\nTruth’s application during the summer and fall semesters of\n2002.\n\n   During this period, we decided Prince v. Jacoby, which\ninvolved a request by a Bible club for ASB recognition in a\ndifferent Washington school district. 303 F.3d 1074 (9th Cir.\n\f12448           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n2002). On January 7, 2003, an attorney for Truth, Robert\nTyler, wrote to Albrecht stating that it was “constitutionally\nimperative that [Kentridge] grant [appellants’] proposed Bible\nClub treatment and rights equal to all other noncurriculum\nclubs.” The letter also insisted that Kentridge “immediately\nadhere to the requirements of the Equal Access Act and the\nFirst Amendment,” and threatened litigation if Kentridge did\nnot comply.\n\n   On January 30, 2003, Tyler sent a second letter to Michael\nHarrington, counsel for the Kent School District. Tyler\nrequested the forms required to establish an ASB club, and\nthreatened litigation if Truth’s charter was not approved by\nFebruary 4.\n\n   On February 2, as requested by Anderson, Undis and Stew-\nart submitted a new application (second charter). The second\ncharter removed the quote-of-the-week and monthly theme\ndecoration provisions of the first charter. The club’s stated\npurpose was now to “provid[e] a biblically-based club for\nthose students interested in growing in their relationship with\nJesus Christ.” Although membership would be open to all stu-\ndents, the second charter restricted voting membership to\n“members professing belief in the Bible and in Jesus Christ.”\nOfficers would also be required to “believe in and be commit-\nted to biblical principles.”\n\n   After a third letter to Harrington from Tyler, the second\ncharter was discussed at an ASB Council meeting on March\n27. Some students expressed disapproval of the club’s name,\nsuggesting that it “implies that every other religion at Ken-\ntridge is a lie.” Some council members also expressed con-\ncerns that granting the charter would violate “[c]hurch and\nstate” and that the voting membership should be open to\neveryone. Additionally, members suggested that students\ncould go to “Young Life,” a non-ASB recognized organiza-\ntion that met on Kentridge’s campus after school hours. The\nminutes of the March 27 meeting reveal that the question of\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT            12449\nwhether to approve the second charter was discussed for\ntwenty minutes. No vote was taken.\n\n   The second charter was next addressed at an ASB Council\nmeeting on April 1. After a brief clarification on the role of\nthe advisor for the club, the minutes show that Anderson\nstated that if the ASB Council voted to approve the charter,\nhe would consult the District’s attorneys and Kentridge would\nmake a final decision on approving the charter. The Counsel\nvoted eleven to six against approval of Truth’s second charter.\n\n   On April 3, Truth filed a complaint in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington, alleg-\ning that defendants had violated the Act, as well as the First\nAmendment rights of free speech and expressive association,\nthe Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment Clause, and the\nEqual Protection Clause. Truth sought injunctive and declara-\ntory relief as well as nominal damages.\n\n   On April 9, Anderson sent Stewart a letter informing her of\nher right to resubmit Truth’s application for ASB club recog-\nnition: “As was discussed at the ASB meeting on March 28th,\nby making minor changes to Article[s] I and III of the pro-\nposed Constitution for your club, you will address the points\nraised.” Article I sets forth the name of the club and Article\nIII contains the voting membership and officer restrictions.\nAnderson advised Stewart to “be prepared to resubmit by the\nApril 25th ASB Meeting.” Under the Kentridge ASB Consti-\ntution, “[a]ny rejected charters must be resubmitted within\ntwo weeks of rejection with the required changes made or the\ncharter shall be permanently rejected.”\n\n  Stewart and Undis submitted the third charter on April 24.\nThe third charter maintains the proposed name “Truth.” How-\never, it divides the membership into three categories: voting\nmembers, non-voting members, and attendees. Meetings are\nopen to everyone. But the “privilege of membership is contin-\ngent upon the member complying in good faith with Christian\n\f12450            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\ncharacter, Christian speech, Christian behavior and Christian\nconduct as generally described in the Bible.” The charter\napplication also lists a “true desire to . . . grow in a relation-\nship with Jesus Christ” under the “Membership Criteria”\nheading. In order to be a voting member or officer, students\nare required to sign a “statement of faith.” The statement of\nfaith requires the person to affirm that he or she believes “the\nBible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative\nWord of God.” A voting member must also pledge that he or\nshe believes “that salvation is an undeserved gift from God,”\nand that only by “acceptance of Jesus Christ as my personal\nSavior, through His death on the cross for my sins, is my faith\nmade real.” Other than the ability to call oneself a “member,”\nthere is no difference between the rights of non-voting mem-\nbers and attendees.\n\n   The third charter was discussed at the April 25 ASB Coun-\ncil meeting. The ASB Council again objected to the name,\nselectivity provisions, and the presence of religion in school.\nThe council voted nineteen to zero to deny approval of the\ncharter, with one member undecided. The minutes give four\nreasons why the charter was not accepted: 1) “Name,”\n2) “Pledge to vote,” 3) “Segregating,” 4) “Religious club in\nschool.”\n\n   On May 6, Tyler wrote to the Kent School District’s coun-\nsel stating that it was his “understanding from the ASB Con-\nstitution that this rejection by the ASB is the final decision.”\nThe letter also provided that Tyler “was unable to locate any\nrights to appeal the decision of the ASB,” but that if there\nwere “a right to appeal the decision of the ASB,” he asked\nthat the letter “serve as a formal request for appeal.”\n\n   Anderson advised Undis and Stewart in a May 12 letter\n“that pursuant to Kent School District Policy 2340, [they had]\nthe ability to discuss this matter with Mr. Albrecht,” and men-\ntioned the possibility of discussions with the District superin-\ntendent or the ombudservices office. Although Tyler’s May 6\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12451\nletter would appear to have invoked these processes, no fur-\nther action was taken by the District. Policy 2340 concerns\n“religious related activities or practices.” The policy does not\nrefer to ASB recognition, and the ASB Constitution does not\nrefer to this policy as providing an avenue for an appeal of the\nDistrict’s decisions, which are otherwise “final.”\n\n  Although Undis and Stewart have both graduated from\nKentridge, they have indicated that another student, Lindsay\nThomas, is prepared to assume leadership of the club if the\ncharter is approved.\n\n   The Kent School District has three policies relevant to this\nappeal. First, Policy 3210 provides that “[t]he district will\nprovide equal educational opportunity and treatment for all\nstudents in all aspects of the academic and activities program.\nEqual opportunity and treatment is provided without regard to\nrace, creed, color, national origin, sex, marital status, previous\narrest . . . , incarceration, or physical, sensory or mental dis-\nabilities.” The district court held that inclusion of “creed”\nindicates that discrimination based upon religion is prohibited.\nThat ruling has not been challenged on appeal.\n\n   Second, Policy 2153 provides for “noncurriculum-related,\nnon ASB student groups,” which groups the principal shall\napprove provided they meet several additional requirements,\nsuch as that they do not disrupt the school environment.\nWhile Policy 2153 groups may meet on school grounds\nbefore or after school, these groups do not receive other bene-\nfits accorded only to ASB-sponsored student clubs. Most sig-\nnificantly, only ASB-chartered groups may receive ASB\nfunding and engage in purchasing through the Kent School\nDistrict Finance Department. Each ASB club is provided with\na faculty advisor or adult advisor designee, who must be pres-\nent at all club meetings and assists in the planning and han-\ndling of the club’s affairs. ASB clubs are also allowed to\nconduct meetings during noninstructional time, advertise their\nactivities in school, use the public address system, and are\n\f12452           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nrecognized in the school yearbook. The District states that\nTruth “is free to operate as a private Policy 2153 group,” but\nargues that Truth was properly denied ASB recognition.\n\n   Third, Policy 2340P regulates “religious related activities\nor practices,” and provides guidelines for schools addressing\nreligious holidays, symbols, ceremonies, topics, activities, and\nbeliefs. This policy also provides that “[s]tudents, parents, and\nemployees who are aggrieved by practices or activities con-\nducted in the school or district may seek resolution of their\nconcern first with the building principal, then with the district\nsuperintendent or designee, or use ombudservices, which is\navailable through the Legal Services Department.”\n\n   Washington State also has a relevant non-discrimination\nlaw, which the District relies on to justify its denial of ASB\nrecognition for Truth. In 2003, Washington Revised Code\n§ 49.60.215 (West 2006) provided that:\n\n    It shall be an unfair practice for any person or the\n    person’s agent or employee to commit an act which\n    directly or indirectly results in any distinction,\n    restriction, or discrimination, . . . or the refusing or\n    withholding from any person the admission, patron-\n    age, custom, presence, frequenting, dwelling, stay-\n    ing, or lodging in any place of public resort,\n    accommodation, assemblage, or amusement, except\n    for conditions and limitations established by law and\n    applicable to all persons, regardless of race, creed,\n    color, national origin, sexual orientation, sex, the\n    presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disabil-\n    ity, or the use of a trained dog guide or service ani-\n    mal by a disabled person.\n\nThe District has argued that these non-discrimination policies\nrequire it to deny ASB recognition to Truth.\n\n   As of April 3, 2003, there were thirty ASB-recognized\nclubs at Kentridge. While the record does not contain the\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12453\ncharters of all the clubs, it appears that many of them have\nselective membership criteria. Indeed, each charter applica-\ntion contains a section for “Membership Criteria.”\n\n   The EarthCorps, for example, requires members to show\n“interest and dedication toward environmental issues.” Simi-\nlarly, the Key Club requires that members be “interested in\nservice, qualified scholastically, of good character, possessing\nleadership potential . . . [and] willing to perform at least fifty\nhours of . . . service.” The Gay-Straight Alliance requires that\nstudents “must be willing to work towards the goals of the\nclub” to be members. These goals include “bring[ing]\nGLBTQ [Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered, and Ques-\ntioning] issues into the open, while working to decrease\nhomophobia.” Other goals include “changing stereotypes”\nand “fight[ing] heterosexism and other forms of oppression.”\nThe National Honor Society selects its members based on\n“outstanding scholarship, character, leadership, and service,”\nand requires them to “behave in a courteous and respectful\nmanner, refraining from language and actions that might bring\ndiscredit upon themselves.” It also requires members to\nrefrain from using or possessing alcohol or illegal substances.\nParticipation in school sports requires maintaining a certain\ngrade point average and attendance record, not using drugs or\nalcohol, and complying with the “sports code.” Finally, a\nMen’s Honor Club and a Girl’s Honor Club also operate at\nKentridge as ASB-recognized groups. Each club has gender-\nexclusive membership.\n\n   The district court entered summary judgment on all of\nTruth’s claims under Monell v. Department of Social Services,\n436 U.S. 658 (1978), with the exception of the Act claim. The\ncourt held that the requirements of municipal liability under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 were not satisfied, and therefore entered\nsummary judgment in favor of the District. It also held that\nthe actions against the individual defendants in their official\ncapacities were functionally equivalent to suits directly\n\f12454           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nagainst the municipality, and therefore Truth’s claims against\nthem failed.\n\n   The district court ruled on the merits of the Act and some\nof the First Amendment claims, addressing the latter as an\nalternate holding if its Monell ruling were to be reversed. It\nheld that the restrictions on general membership in the third\ncharter constituted a legitimate basis for denying the third\ncharter and that these claims therefore failed.\n\n   The district court did not rule on the remaining claims\nbased on its belief that “Plaintiffs’ cursory Equal Protection\nClause, Establishment Clause, and Free Exercise Clause argu-\nments are all subsumed within their First Amendment argu-\nment.” The district court also did not address the District’s\nargument that granting ASB recognition to Truth would vio-\nlate the Establishment Clause.\n\n  On appeal, both sides agree that only the third charter is\nbefore us. Truth makes this concession even though this\naction was filed before the third charter and its complaint only\naddresses the denial of its second charter.\n\n   This appeal requires us to review many determinations by\nthe district court. As to each issue, we review de novo. We\nreview a district court’s summary judgment de novo. See\nBuono v. Norton, 371 F.3d 543, 545 (9th Cir. 2004). In deter-\nmining whether summary judgment was appropriate, we view\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to Truth, the non-\nmoving party. See Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., 363 F.3d\n916, 922 (9th Cir. 2004). “We may affirm on any ground sup-\nported by the record.” Id. We also review de novo the district\ncourt’s Monell rulings, see Doe v. Lebbos, 348 F.3d 820, 825\n(9th Cir. 2003), its “decision regarding the scope of a consti-\ntutional right,” see United States v. Napier, 436 F.3d 1133,\n1135-36 (9th Cir. 2006), and its interpretation of the Act, see\nSEC v. McCarthy, 322 F.3d 650, 654 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12455\n                              II.\n\n   Before addressing the merits, we consider our jurisdiction.\nThe District argues that Truth lacks standing under City of Los\nAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983), because Truth has\nfailed to meet the “likelihood of recurrence” requirement. The\nDistrict asserts that Truth “cannot say the ASB or the District\nwill always deny another Club application or even the same\napplication.”\n\n  [1] In order to establish Article III standing,\n\n    a plaintiff must show (1) it has suffered an “injury in\n    fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b)\n    actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical;\n    (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged\n    action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as\n    opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be\n    redressed by a favorable decision.\n\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528\nU.S. 167, 180-81 (2000). Although the District has not made\nany arguments regarding these specific factors, we have an\nindependent obligation to address whether we have subject-\nmatter jurisdiction. See Dittman v. California, 191 F.3d 1020,\n1025 (9th Cir. 1999). “[A]t the summary judgment stage the\nplaintiffs need not establish that they in fact have standing,\nbut only that there is a genuine question of material fact as to\nthe standing elements.” Cent. Delta Water Agency v. United\nStates, 306 F.3d 938, 947 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n   [2] With respect to injunctive relief, the Supreme Court has\nalso required that a plaintiff show that “he is realistically\nthreatened by a repetition of [the violation].” Lyons, 461 U.S.\nat 109. “The plaintiff need only establish that there is a rea-\nsonable expectation that his conduct will recur, triggering the\nalleged harm; he need not show that such recurrence is proba-\nble.” Jones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118, 1127 (9th\n\f12456           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nCir. 2006), citing Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318 & n.6\n(1988). While we have extended this requirement to declara-\ntory relief, see Gest v. Bradbury, 443 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th\nCir. 2006), it does not apply to monetary damages, see Lyons,\n461 U.S. at 105. The District’s standing argument therefore\ndoes not implicate Truth’s standing to seek nominal damages.\n\n   The District asserts that the Establishment Clause, state\nlaw, and its own non-discrimination policies mandate that it\ndeny ASB recognition to Truth. If the District believes that\nthree independent and binding legal authorities compel it to\ndeny Truth’s application, we do not see how the District\nmight approve the same or a similar charter request in the\nfuture.\n\n   [3] The District’s written non-discrimination policies also\nsupport Truth’s standing arguments. We have held that plain-\ntiffs “may demonstrate that an injury is likely to recur by\nshowing that the defendant had . . . a written policy, and that\nthe injury ‘stems from’ that policy. Where the harm alleged\nis directly traceable to a written policy there is an implicit\nlikelihood of its repetition in the immediate future.” Fortyune\nv. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., 364 F.3d 1075, 1081 (9th Cir.\n2004) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). Here, the\nharm is traceable to the District’s policies, which the District\nhas argued compel it to deny ASB recognition to Truth.\n\n   Additionally, despite Tyler’s request that the District treat\nhis letter as a “formal request for appeal,” the District took no\naction. This is evidence that another charter request is likely\nto meet the same fate as the previous three. Finally, the Dis-\ntrict has provided nothing beyond its own speculation that the\noutcome might be different if Truth submitted a fourth char-\nter. The legal positions it has taken in this litigation strongly\nsuggest that no similar applications will ever be approved.\n\n   [4] Under these circumstances, we conclude that Truth has\nestablished at least a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12457\nwhether there is a reasonable expectation that the alleged\ninjury will recur. Therefore, Truth has standing to seek each\nof its requested forms of relief.\n\n   The District also suggests that this dispute is not ripe for\nreview, and that we thus lack jurisdiction, because Truth did\nnot bring the dispute to the Kent School District Board or\nSuperintendent through Policy 2340P. The District is wrong.\nThe Supreme Court has explicitly held that exhaustion is not\nrequired for claims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Stef-\nfel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 472-73 (1974). Exhaustion\ncannot be dispositive under a ripeness analysis; otherwise\nripeness doctrine would impose a de facto exhaustion require-\nment, in violation of Steffel. Thus, the alleged failure to\nexhaust administrative remedies may be at most only a factor\nin the ripeness analysis.\n\n   [5] Nevertheless, it appears that Truth did exhaust the for-\nmal appeal system. Tyler’s May 6 letter to the District’s coun-\nsel asked that the letter “serve as a formal request for appeal.”\nThe District has not provided any reason why this notification\nwas not sufficient to trigger its appeals process, and no reason\nis apparent in the record. The District’s failure to take any\naction as a result of this request does not indicate that Truth\nfailed to bring the matter to the attention of the District. Under\nthese circumstances, there is at least a genuine issue of mate-\nrial fact as to whether Truth exhausted the District’s grievance\nprocedures.\n\n   Nearly every other factor suggests that this case is ripe for\ndecision. Under the Kentridge ASB Constitution, “[a]ny\nrejected charters must be resubmitted within two weeks of\nrejection with the required changes made or the charter shall\nbe permanently rejected.” The ASB Constitution neither pro-\nvides for any additional review, nor suggests that the ASB\nCouncil’s decision lacked finality.\n\n  Furthermore, there is no doubt that the effects of the denial\nof Truth’s charter have been felt in a concrete way by the\n\f12458           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nappellants. Truth’s members have experienced three denials\nof their applications, as well as protracted delays in obtaining\nany action from the ASB Council and District. The harm that\nTruth has complained of does not “rest[ ] upon contingent\nfuture events” or ones that “may not occur at all.” Texas v.\nUnited States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (internal quotation\nomitted). Instead, Truth complains of discrete events that have\nalready occurred.\n\n   [6] Finally, “in evaluating ripeness, courts assess both the\nfitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to\nthe parties of withholding court consideration.” Ass’n of Am.\nMed. Colls. v. United States, 217 F.3d 770, 779-80 (9th Cir.\n2000) (internal quotation omitted). We conclude the hardship\nto Truth in denying adjudication outweighs the hardship to the\nDistrict in deciding this appeal. Truth’s application for ASB\nrecognition languished for nearly sixteen months without any\nsignificant action being taken, and the ASB process appears\nto have stalled until Truth obtained counsel and threatened to\nsue. More than five years have passed since the submission of\nthe first charter, and declining to decide this appeal now\nwould present a significant hardship to appellants.\n\n   [7] By contrast, the hardship to the District is significantly\nless severe. The District has been aware of Truth’s arguments\nfor a long time and has had ample opportunity to take correc-\ntive action or change its policies, if it so desired. Its legal\npositions on appeal show that it does not believe any remedial\naction is appropriate and that it believes the denial of ASB\nrecognition was proper. We therefore conclude that this case\nis ripe for decision.\n\n                              III.\n\n  [8] We must also consider the district court’s ruling that the\nrequirements of Monell are not met. Monell permits section\n1983 actions against municipalities, but requires plaintiffs to\nshow that their injuries resulted from “execution of a govern-\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT              12459\nment’s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or\nby those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent\nofficial policy.” 436 U.S. at 694. Monell’s requirements do\nnot apply where the plaintiffs only seek prospective relief,\nwhich is the case here. See Chaloux v. Killeen, 886 F.2d 247,\n250-51 (9th Cir. 1989). The District acknowledges the con-\ntrolling effect of Chaloux, but argues that it should be over-\nruled because it “rests on shaky grounds.”\n\n  [9] It is well established in our circuit that while\n\n    a three judge panel normally cannot overrule a deci-\n    sion of a prior panel on a controlling question of law,\n    we may overrule prior circuit authority without tak-\n    ing the case en banc when an intervening Supreme\n    Court decision undermines an existing precedent of\n    the Ninth Circuit, and both cases are closely on\n    point.\n\nGalbraith v. County of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119, 1123 (9th\nCir. 2002) (internal citation and quotations omitted). The Dis-\ntrict argues that two Supreme Court cases, Board of County\nCommissioners of Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397\n(1997), and McMillian v. Monroe County, 520 U.S. 781\n(1997), show that the “Supreme Court has re-emphasized the\nimportance and vitality of the doctrine that requires a munici-\npal policy as a precondition to a lawsuit under § 1983.” Nei-\nther of these cases addresses whether Monell applies to\nactions only seeking prospective relief. We have no authority\nto overrule Chaloux. Chaloux applies, and the district court’s\nMonell ruling is reversed.\n\n                              IV.\n\n  Relying on its non-discrimination policies, the District\npoints to three aspects of Truth’s third charter that justify its\ndecision to deny the club ASB recognition: 1) the general\nmembership restrictions, 2) the leadership and voting mem-\n\f12460            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nbership restrictions, and 3) the name “Truth.” The district\ncourt granted summary judgment based only on the first justi-\nfication, and explicitly declined to reach the other two.\nAccordingly, we too limit our analysis to the general member-\nship restrictions. So long as the District had at least one per-\nmissible basis for rejecting Truth’s charter, the district court\nproperly granted summary judgment, and we need not address\nthe District’s remaining justifications.\n\n   We begin our analysis by considering whether the District\nviolated the Act. If we determine that it did not, we then move\non to consider whether the District’s actions ran afoul of the\nFirst Amendment. See Prince v. Jacoby, 303 F.3d 1074, 1077\n(9th Cir. 2002) (“We consider each of Prince’s access claims\nseparately, first under the Act, and then the First Amendment,\nto the extent we find them outside the scope of the Act”).\n\n                               A.\n\n   [10] States have the constitutional authority to enact legis-\nlation prohibiting invidious discrimination. See Roberts v.\nUnited States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 624-26 (1984) (review-\ning the history of state anti-discrimination laws and observing\nthat a “State enjoys broad authority to create rights of public\naccess on behalf of its citizens”). Truth asserts that it does not\ndiscriminate based on religion in violation of the plain lan-\nguage of the District’s policies, but rather imposes a code of\nconduct not unlike those of other approved ASB clubs. Even\nassuming that non-Christians would be able to comply with\nTruth’s view of “Christian character, Christian speech, Chris-\ntian behavior and Christian conduct,” we hold that the\nrequirement that members possess a “true desire to . . . grow\nin a relationship with Jesus Christ” inherently excludes non-\nChristians.\n\n   [11] Having determined that the third charter violates the\nDistrict’s non-discrimination policies, we are led to hold that\nthe District’s denial of ASB recognition on this account\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT               12461\nwould be consistent with the Act. The Act requires federally-\nfunded schools that have created a limited open forum to\ngrant religious clubs benefits and privileges afforded to all\nother non-curriculum clubs. See Bd. of Educ. of the Westside\nCmty. Schs. v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 235-36 (1990); Prince,\n303 F.3d at 1081 (“[T]he term ‘equal access’ means what the\nSupreme Court said in Widmar [v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263,\n267-71 (1981)]: religiously-oriented student activities must be\nallowed under the same terms and conditions as other extra-\ncurricular activities . . .”). Prince held that the rights protected\nunder the Act include equal access to some of the benefits\nassociated with ASB status, including ASB funding and pub-\nlic communication techniques. 303 F.3d at 1084-90. The Dis-\ntrict does not argue that it is not required under the Act to\nprovide equal access to the ASB program.\n\n   In interpreting the Act, we begin with its plain language.\n“Where the intent of Congress has been expressed in reason-\nably plain terms, that language must ordinarily be regarded as\nconclusive.” Id. at 1079 (internal quotations and citation omit-\nted). Where there may be uncertainty, however, we rely on\nthe Supreme Court’s direction that the Act is to be “inter-\npreted broadly,” Mergens, 496 U.S. at 239, as well as cases\ndeciding analogous issues under the First Amendment. Cf.\nHsu v. Roslyn Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 3, 85 F.3d 839, 855-\n56 (2d Cir. 1996) (adopting similar approach).\n\n   [12] By its plain terms, the Act prevents only denials of\naccess or fair opportunity or discrimination “on the basis of\nthe religious, political, philosophical, or other content of the\nspeech at [a club’s] meetings.” 20 U.S.C. § 4071(a). There-\nfore, once it is established that the secondary school receives\nfederal funds and has created a limited open forum, the club\nmust demonstrate two additional elements to prevail: 1) a\ndenial of equal access, or fair opportunity, or discrimination;\n2) that is based on the “content of the speech” at its meetings.\n\f12462              TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   [13] The District denied Truth ASB status, at least in part,\nbased on its discriminatory membership criteria, not the reli-\ngious “content of the speech.”1 The Act does not define “con-\ntent of the speech,” but that phrase has a particular meaning\nin First Amendment jurisprudence. We have held that\n“whether a statute is content neutral or content based is some-\nthing that can be determined on the face of it; if the statute\ndescribes speech by content then it is content based.” Menotti\nv. City of Seattle, 409 F.3d 1113, 1129 (9th Cir. 2005) (quota-\ntions and citation omitted). Similarly, a “restriction on expres-\nsive activity is content-neutral if it is . . . based on a non-\npretextual reason divorced from the content of the message\nattempted to be conveyed.” Id. (quotations and citation omit-\nted).\n\n   The Act, through which Congress extended the reasoning\nof the Supreme Court’s 1981 decision in Widmar v. Vincent\nto secondary schools, see Mergens, 496 U.S. at 235, tracks\nWidmar’s emphasis on discrimination based on the content of\nthe plaintiff’s speech. Widmar struck down a state universi-\nty’s regulation prohibiting the use of university buildings or\ngrounds “for purposes of religious worship or religious teach-\ning.” 454 U.S. 263, 265 (1981). Widmar thus precluded a uni-\nversity’s “discriminatory exclusion from a public forum based\non the religious content of a group’s intended speech,” id. at\n269-70, but not its “right to exclude . . . First Amendment\nactivities that violate reasonable campus rules.” Id. at 277.\nLikewise, the Act prevents a school’s unreasonable limitation\non the conduct of a club to the extent the limitation is justified\nwith reference to the expressive content of the regulated con-\nduct. Cf. Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791\n  1\n   Although the District gave several reasons for denying Truth’s charter,\nsome of which appear to have been based on the content of Truth’s\nspeech, the district court based its analysis only on the group’s discrimina-\ntory membership policies. Therefore, we too limit our analysis to this issue\nwhen determining whether the district court’s summary judgment was\nappropriate.\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12463\n(1989) (“Government regulation of expressive activity is con-\ntent neutral so long as it is justified without reference to the\ncontent of the regulated speech” (internal quotations and cita-\ntion omitted)).\n\n   [14] Congress could have written the Act to protect reli-\ngious clubs against a burden on their speech or activities, but\ndid not. For example, when Congress passed the Religious\nLand Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, it not only pro-\nhibited discrimination against religious groups as such but\nalso limited governments’ abilities to impose even neutral,\nnondiscriminatory policies against them:\n\n    No government shall impose or implement a land\n    use regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial\n    burden on the religious exercise of a person, includ-\n    ing a religious assembly or institution, unless the\n    government demonstrates that imposition of the bur-\n    den on that person, assembly, or institution—\n\n         (A) is in furtherance of a compelling gov-\n         ernmental interest; and\n\n         (B) is the least restrictive means of further-\n         ing that compelling governmental interest.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000cc(a)(1). Thus, Congress knows how to draft\na statute placing otherwise content-neutral laws of general\napplicability that incidentally burden a First Amendment\nactivity under the same judicial scrutiny as laws specifically\ntargeting the religious content of a group’s expression. See\nGuru Nanak Sikh Soc’y of Yuba City v. County of Sutter, 456\nF.3d 978, 985-86 (9th Cir. 2006). That is not the case here.\nThe Act clearly allows exclusions that are not “content”-\nbased.\n\n   [15] The Act’s legislative history strengthens our conclu-\nsion that it prohibits only content-based restrictions on reli-\n\f12464            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\ngious groups. The legislative history focuses on Congress’s\nintent to end school districts’ previous practices of treating\nreligious groups inequitably and forbidding them from meet-\ning on campus. See S. Rep. 98-357, at 6, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n2348, 2352 (1984) (“Despite Widmar, many school adminis-\ntrators across the country are prohibiting voluntary, student-\ninitiated religious speech as an [e]xtracurricular activity”); id.\nat 15, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2361 (“[S]chool authorities\nacross the country are banishing religious clubs from campus\nor placing such onerous restrictions on them that meetings\nbecome almost impossible”). The Senate Report recognized\nthe possibility that religious groups like Truth might claim\nthat content-neutral policies regulating club membership vio-\nlate the Act, and disclaimed any such intent:\n\n    At the same time, the guarantee of equal access does\n    not require special treatment for religious groups.\n    Religious groups are accorded only the same rights\n    and privileges as are granted to other student groups.\n    In practice, however, this means that not all student\n    groups would receive exactly the same privileges.\n    There could be many neutral and impartial time,\n    place, and manner restrictions placed on the use of\n    school facilities which might produce situations in\n    which some voluntary groups would not receive pre-\n    cisely the same access received by others. . . . The\n    access determination could not be made, however,\n    on the basis that the nature of the activity was reli-\n    gious.\n\nId. at 39, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2385. The District’s non-\ndiscrimination policies are not time, place or manner restric-\ntions. But like such restrictions, the policies are content-\nneutral. This strongly suggests that Congress did not intend\nthe Act to apply to non-discrimination policies.\n\n   [16] The parties do not dispute that the Kent School District\nreceives federal funding, or that Kentridge has created a lim-\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12465\nited open forum for extracurricular student groups. The Dis-\ntrict contests, however, whether the Act’s guarantee of equal\naccess, fair opportunity, and non-discrimination protects\nTruth’s freedom to exclude those who do not share Christian\nvalues from its general membership. On their face, the Dis-\ntrict’s non-discrimination policies do not preclude or discrimi-\nnate against religious speech. Truth also has not shown that\nthe District justifies its non-discrimination policies with refer-\nence to the content of a message Truth’s discriminatory con-\nduct may attempt to convey. The policies are content-neutral.\nTherefore, to the extent they proscribe Truth’s discriminatory\ngeneral membership restrictions, the policies do not implicate\nany rights that Truth might enjoy under the Act. Cf. Rumsfeld\nv. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S.\n47, 60 (2006) (holding that a statute or regulation that condi-\ntions government benefits on a non-discriminatory campus\naccess policy is properly categorized as conduct, not speech).\n\n   Our decision is not inconsistent with that of the Second Cir-\ncuit, which has focused on the term “speech” in the Act rather\nthan the content-neutrality (or lack thereof) of school policies.\nSee Hsu, 85 F.3d at 856 (rejecting argument that Act was not\nimplicated because “the School did not base its qualified rec-\nognition of the Club on what would be said at the Club meet-\nings, but on what could be characterized as the Club’s ‘act’\nof excluding non-Christians from leadership”); id. at 859 (Act\ntriggered “when an after-school religious club excludes peo-\nple of other religions from conducting its meetings . . . to pro-\ntect the expressive content of the meetings”). The court’s\ndecision in Hsu is readily distinguishable from the case at\nhand. In Hsu, a Christian group was seeking to impose a reli-\ngious test for all of its leadership positions. Id. at 849. The\ncourt held that the group’s ability to exclude non-Christians\nfrom some, but not all, of these leadership positions consti-\ntuted “speech” within the meaning of the Act. Id. at 858. In\ncontrast, we are only concerned with Truth’s general mem-\nbership requirements. The Second Circuit’s decision in Hsu\ndirectly supports our holding with respect to these require-\n\f12466              TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nments. The court held that “a religious test for membership or\nattendance” would be “plainly insupportable,” since “[i]t is\ndifficult to understand how allowing non-Christians to attend\nthe meetings and sing (or listen to) Christian prayers would\nchange the Club’s speech.” Id. at 858 & n.17.\n\n   [17] In short, Truth has not shown that the District’s non-\ndiscrimination policy restricts ASB status on the basis of reli-\ngion or the religious content of speech. Truth also argues,\nhowever, that the District violated the Act by allowing certain\ngroups an exemption from the non-discrimination policy. Here\nwe understand Truth to be challenging an allegedly arbitrary\nor discriminatory practice of granting waivers to non-religious\ngroups, but not religious groups. This challenge is different in\nkind from one asserting that the application of the non-\ndiscrimination policy to Truth violates Truth’s rights under\nthe Act. If indeed the District has a policy of enforcing the\nnon-discrimination policy only against religious groups, this\npolicy would of course violate the Act. Many of the so-called\n‘exemptions’ that Truth contests are in fact consistent with the\nDistrict’s non-discrimination policy. For example, several\nclubs, such as the EarthCorps and the Gay-Straight Alliance,\nrequire their members to support a specific political cause, but\nnothing in the District’s non-discrimination policy prohibits\ndiscrimination on the basis of political belief. However, at\nleast two groups, the Men’s Honor Club and the Girl’s Honor\nClub, were granted ASB recognition even though their mem-\nbership is based on gender, a protected ground under the Dis-\ntrict’s policy. There is no evidence in the record as to why\nthese groups were allowed apparent waivers from the Dis-\ntrict’s non-discrimination policy. Thus, to the extent Truth\nalleges that the District provided waivers to these groups\nwhile denying them to others, and that decision was made on\nthe basis of religion or the religious content of speech, Truth\nhas raised a triable issue of fact.2 Therefore, we reverse the\n  2\n   Although Truth has raised a triable issue of fact, we call attention to\ntwo potential problems with its argument. First, Congress has specifically\n\f                    TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT                     12467\ndistrict court’s summary judgment and remand for further\nproceedings on this limited issue.\n\n                                     B.\n\n   [18] We next address whether, and if so how, the First\nAmendment may apply where a school denies ASB recogni-\ntion to a student club based on its membership criteria. As an\ninitial matter, it is important to emphasize that the members\nof Truth are not seeking merely to associate as a group; they\nare seeking to associate as a school-sponsored group. Specifi-\ncally, ASB recognition would give Truth access to ASB\nfunds, additional access to the school’s property and facilities,\nand special rights to post materials around the school. There-\nfore, we must evaluate the District’s denial of ASB recogni-\ntion as a restriction on a “limited public forum.” See\nRosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S.\n819, 829 (1995) (applying limited public forum analysis to\nreligious group’s request for student activities funds); see also\nPrince, 303 F.3d at 1091 (holding that a school, through its\nASB program, “created a limited public forum”).\n\n  The limited public forum framework “has been the source\nof much confusion” and the precise contours of the term\n\nallowed for “separate but equal” gender discrimination in the context of\nschool and youth activities. See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6) (providing that\ngender discrimination is allowed with regard to certain social fraternities\nand sororities and volunteer youth organizations that have traditionally\nbeen limited to one sex). Therefore, that the District exempts the Men’s\nand Girl’s Honor Clubs from its overarching gender discrimination policy\ndoes not, by itself, suggest an arbitrary or discriminatory application of\nthat policy so as to violate the Act. Second, another high school and a\njunior high school in the District have granted ASB-recognition to other\nBible groups that do not discriminate in their membership criteria, making\nit even less likely that the District’s application of its anti-discrimination\npolicy in this case was merely a pretext for religious animus. Nevertheless,\nbecause the record is devoid of any evidence as to the actual reason that\nthe District granted a non-discrimination waiver to the Men’s and Girl’s\nHonor Clubs, we must remand for further proceedings.\n\f12468           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n“have not always been clear.” Hopper v. City of Pasco, 241\nF.3d 1067, 1074 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotations and cita-\ntion omitted). The Supreme Court first addressed the concept,\nindirectly, in Widmar. The Court recognized that, although\nthe state is not required to open certain fora to public dis-\ncourse, once it elects to do so, it “assume[s] an obligation to\njustify its discriminations and exclusions under applicable\nconstitutional norms.” Widmar, 454 U.S. at 267-68. Two\nyears later, in Perry Education Association v. Perry Local\nEducators’ Association, 460 U.S. 37, 44-45 (1983), the\nSupreme Court clarified that there are three categories of\ngovernment-run fora. “At one end of the spectrum are streets\nand parks which have immemorially been held in trust for the\nuse of the public.” Id. at 45 (internal quotations omitted). On\nthe opposite end of the spectrum are those government prop-\nerties that have not been traditionally considered open to the\npublic. Id. at 46. Finally, falling somewhere in between are\nlimited public fora, which “consist[ ] of public property which\nthe state has opened for use by the public as a place for\nexpressive activity.” Id. at 45.\n\n   [19] In Rosenberger, the Supreme Court held that the gov-\nernment may exclude speech in a “limited public forum,” so\nlong as its reasons for doing so are viewpoint neutral and\n“reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.” 515\nU.S. at 829 (quotations and citation omitted). Access to ASB\nrecognition qualifies as a limited public forum. See Prince,\n303 F.3d at 1091. Therefore, we must consider whether the\nDistrict’s policy of restricting access to the ASB forum based\non compliance with its non-discrimination policy is viewpoint\nneutral and reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum.\n\n   [20] The ASB Constitution makes it clear that the purpose\nof the organization “is to develop attitudes of and practice in\ngood citizenship within the school; to promote harmonious\nrelations between students, clubs, and activities; and to act as\na forum for student and faculty expression.” The constitution\nfurther states that this purpose will be carried out by\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12469\n“[h]elping the student body develop a regard for law and\norder by obeying, honoring, and sustaining the laws of Wash-\nington State and King County, as well as the rules of Ken-\ntridge Senior High School. . . .” These broad statements of\npurpose show that the purpose of the ASB program is to\nadvance the school’s basic pedagogical goals. The Supreme\nCourt has emphasized that part of a school’s mission is to\ninstill in students the “shared values of a civilized social\norder,” which includes instilling the value of non-\ndiscrimination. See Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484\nU.S. 260, 272 (1988). Therefore, the District’s decision to\nrestrict access to the ASB program based on a group’s will-\ningness to adhere to the school’s non-discrimination policy is\nreasonable in light of the purposes of the forum.\n\n   Because this policy was reasonable in light of the purposes\nserved by the ASB, we must next consider whether the\ngroup’s exclusion was viewpoint neutral. The Supreme Court\nhas explained that “[v]iewpoint discrimination is . . . an egre-\ngious form of content discrimination,” and occurs when “the\nspecific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of\nthe speaker is the rationale for the restriction.” Rosenberger,\n515 U.S. at 829 (emphasis added); see also Perry Educ.\nAss’n, 460 U.S. at 46 (regulation on access to a forum is not\nviewpoint neutral if it is “an effort to suppress expression\nmerely because public officials oppose the speaker’s view”).\nIn cases where restriction to the forum is based solely on the\ngroup’s religious viewpoint, the restriction is invalid. This\nwas the case in Prince, where the school refused to recognize\nthe school group World Changers “based purely on the\n[group’s] religious viewpoint.” 303 F.3d at 1091.\n\n   [21] Here, in contrast, the school is not denying Truth\naccess based solely on its religious viewpoint, but rather on\nits refusal to comply with the District’s non-discrimination\npolicy. The District was therefore not engaging in viewpoint\ndiscrimination; the “perspective of the speaker” was not the\n“rationale” for denying Truth access to the limited public\n\f12470           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nforum. See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829. Applying the non-\ndiscrimination policy to exclude Truth does not show that the\nschool administrators acted “merely because [they] oppose\nthe speaker’s view.” Perry, 460 U.S. at 46. In short, the Dis-\ntrict no more engaged in viewpoint discrimination by exclud-\ning Truth for refusing to comply with its non-discrimination\npolicy than it would have engaged in viewpoint discrimina-\ntion by refusing to grant ASB status to a Student Pro-Drug\nClub that refused to obey the school’s anti-drug policy. Cf.\nMorse v. Frederick, 127 S.Ct. 2618, 2629 (2007) (holding that\nschools may censor even private student speech that occurs\non school grounds that “they reasonably regard as promoting\nillegal drug use”).\n\n   [22] This conclusion, of course, rests on the premise that\nthe ASB actually denied Truth’s recognition based on its fail-\nure to comply with the District’s non-discrimination policy.\nThere is evidence in the record that other groups, such as the\nMen’s and Girl’s Honor Clubs, were granted ASB recognition\ndespite violating the District’s non-discrimination policy.\nTherefore, to the extent Truth argues that it was denied an\nexemption from the non-discrimination policy based on the\ncontent of its speech, we hold it has raised a triable issue of\nfact, and reverse the district court’s summary judgment.\n\n                              V.\n\n   [23] Truth also makes a claim under the Free Exercise\nClause, the Establishment Clause, and the Equal Protection\nClause. The district court did not explicitly reach these\nclaims, on the grounds that Truth’s “cursory Equal Protection\nClause, Establishment Clause, and Free Exercise arguments\nare all subsumed within their First Amendment argument . . .\n.” On appeal, Truth continues to give cursory treatment to\nthese claims. Nevertheless, Truth may have a valid argument.\nAs discussed earlier, we are remanding to the district court to\ndetermine whether Truth was denied an exemption from the\nDistrict’s non-discrimination policy, and whether that denial\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12471\nwas based on religion or the content of Truth’s speech. To the\nextent Truth can make out a colorable First Amendment vio-\nlation on these grounds, it may also have a Free Exercise\nclaim, since “the Supreme Court noted that free exercise\nclaims implicating other constitutional protections, such as\nfree speech, could qualify for strict scrutiny review . . . .” Am.\nFamily Ass’n v. City & County of San Francisco, 277 F.3d\n1114, 1124 (9th Cir. 2002). Moreover, if Truth can demon-\nstrate that it was singled out for unequal treatment on the\nbasis of religion, it may also have a potentially valid Equal\nProtection or Establishment Clause argument. Therefore, we\nremand these issues to the district court to be considered\nalong with the exemption issue discussed previously.\n\n   Finally, the District has argued that the ASB has free\nspeech rights that would be violated if it were compelled to\nrecognize Truth as an ASB organization. The ASB is not a\nparty to this appeal and there is no indication that the District\nhas authorization from the ASB to assert any such First\nAmendment claims. We conclude that the District lacks pru-\ndential standing to assert the ASB’s free speech rights. See\nKowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004) (“[A] party\ngenerally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and\ncannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests\nof third parties.” (quotations and citation omitted)).\n\n                               VI.\n\n   It is prudent to address only those issues necessary for our\ndecision on the third charter application. We hold only that\nthe District did not violate the Act or Truth’s First Amend-\nment rights by applying its non-discrimination policy to\nrequire Truth to remove its general membership provision. To\nthe extent Truth alleges that the District violated the Act or\nthe First Amendment by refusing to provide an exemption to\nits non-discrimination policy—based on Truth’s religion or\nthe content of its speech—we reverse the district court’s sum-\nmary judgment, and remand for further proceedings.\n\f12472            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n  REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\nFISHER, Circuit Judge, concurring, joined by Judge\nWARDLAW:\n\n   We write separately to amplify on one issue discussed in\nour main opinion. Truth argued that it must be granted access\nto the ASB forum because conditioning its access to the ASB\nprogram on a change to its discriminatory membership policy\nwould infringe its right to engage in speech through “expres-\nsive association.” Expressive association may be burdened\nwhen the state requires a group to change its membership\ncriteria, see Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 656\n(2000); Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 623 (1984), or\nwhen the state conditions access to a traditional public forum\nupon such changes, Hurley v. Irish-Am. Gay, Lesbian &\nBisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557, 579 (1995). When\nthe use of school facilities is part of a general public forum,\ndenying access to those facilities may also implicate the right\nto associate freely. See Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-81\n(1972) (noting that the “college classroom with its surround-\ning environs is peculiarly the ‘marketplace of ideas’ ” and that\nthe complete “denial of use of campus facilities for meetings\nand other appropriate purposes” implicated a group’s right to\nexpressive association).\n\n   Even assuming, however, that Truth’s exclusion of non-\nChristians allows it to engage in speech through expressive\nassociation, its exclusion from the ASB program on account\nof its discriminatory policy does not infringe its rights under\nthe First Amendment. As our opinion explains, when the state\ncreates a limited public forum, like the ASB program at issue\nhere, it may restrict access to that forum so long as the restric-\ntions are “viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the pur-\npose served by the forum,” even if these rules have the effect\nof limiting a group’s ability to engage in protected speech,\n\f                   TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT                   12473\nsuch as the right to speak, publish on a particular topic or\nengage in expressive association. See Rosenberger v. Rector\n& Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995) (“The\nnecessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate\npurposes for which it was created may justify the State in\nreserving it for certain groups or for the discussion of certain\ntopics.” (emphasis added)).\n\n   We reject Truth’s suggestion that state action that burdens\na group’s ability to engage in expressive association must\nalways be subject to strict scrutiny, even if the group seeks to\nengage in expressive association through a limited public\nforum. Expressive association is simply another way of\nspeaking, only the group communicates its message through\nthe act of associating instead of through an act of “pure\nspeech” such as publishing, marching, speaking or perform-\ning. See Dale, 530 U.S. at 648 (holding that the First Amend-\nment protects a group’s ability to exclude members, if\nincluding such members would “impair the ability of the\ngroup to express those views, and only those views, that it\nintends to express”). There is no question that acts of expres-\nsive association are protected forms of speech under the First\nAmendment. See id. at 656; Hurley, 515 U.S. at 579. When\nthe state restricts access to a limited public forum in a way\nthat interferes with a group’s speech or expressive associa-\ntion, however, we apply the lesser standard of scrutiny, even\nif the same burden on a group’s rights outside a limited public\nforum would be subject to strict scrutiny. See Rosenberger,\n515 U.S. at 829-30 (applying limited public forum analysis to\na university policy that excluded a group’s access to the\nschool’s student activity fund, thereby preventing it from pub-\nlishing a newspaper). To hold otherwise would accord an act\nof “pure speech” such as publishing a newspaper — the core\nof what the First Amendment protects — less protection than\nan act of expressive association. We find no support for such\na proposition, and Truth has identified none.1 Truth, of course,\n  1\n   In Christian Legal Soc’y v. Walker, 453 F.3d 853, 859 (7th Cir. 2006),\nthe Seventh Circuit reversed the denial of a preliminary injunction, hold-\n\f12474               TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nhas the option of operating as a Policy 2153 group on school\ngrounds, see 524 F.3d at 963, and as such would be able to\nrestrict its membership unfettered by the school’s nondiscrim-\nination policy. If Truth wants the additional benefits that\ncome from participation in the ASB program, however, Truth\nmust comply with the school’s reasonable, viewpoint-neutral\nrules.\n\n\n\n\ning that a university group had shown that it was “reasonably likely to suc-\nceed on the merits” of its First Amendment claim after being excluded\nfrom campus for violating the school’s nondiscrimination policy, which\nthe group claimed infringed its right to expressive association. Although\nthe Seventh Circuit applied strict scrutiny in addressing this claim, it nota-\nbly stated that it could not even determine, on the limited record before\nit, whether the university had created an open, limited, or nonpublic\nforum. See id. at 866 (“Whether SIU’s student organization forum is a\npublic, designated public, or nonpublic forum is an inquiry that will\nrequire further factual development, and that is a task properly left for the\ndistrict court.”) Walker did not say that strict scrutiny would be appropri-\nate in all cases, even if the university had created something less than an\nopen forum.\n\f",

Truth alleges violations of the Equal Access Act (the\nAct), the First Amendment rights of free speech and expres-\nsive association, the Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment\nClause, and the Equal Protection Clause. We have jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We reverse and remand.\n\n                               I.\n\n   This appeal arises from Truth’s attempt to form a student\nclub at Kentridge High School (Kentridge), which is part of\nthe Kent School District. Under the relevant policies at Ken-\ntridge, “[u]nchartered clubs are not permitted to exist.” To\nobtain a charter, students must submit a proposed charter to\nthe Associated Student Body (ASB) Council and secure\napproval.\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12447\n   Beginning in the fall semester of 2001, appellants Undis,\nthen a junior, and Stewart, then a sophomore, attempted to\nform a Bible club at Kentridge. Undis and Stewart submitted\na “Club Charter Application” (first charter) for official recog-\nnition as an ASB organization in September 2001. This first\ncharter indicated that the club’s name was to be “Truth” and\nthat the purpose of the organization was to “have a Bible\nstudy to encourage and help become better people with good\nmorals.” Under the section “Membership Criteria,” the first\ncharter indicated that the group was to be “[o]pen to anyone.”\nThe charter also proposed that it would designate a “quote of\nthe week for announcement” and “once a month decorate\n[the] school with a theme.”\n\n   The ASB Council discussed Truth’s first charter at a Sep-\ntember 2001 meeting, and several students objected to char-\ntering Truth. The ASB Council decided to consult with the\nAssistant Principal, appellee Eric Anderson. Anderson and\nappellee Mike Albrecht, Principal of Kentridge, later told\nUndis that they would speak with the school’s attorney\nregarding the legality of granting Truth ASB recognition.\nAlbrecht stated that “the problem with the September 2001\nproposal was that it involved broadcasting a weekly Bible\nquote over the school’s public address system and monthly\ndecoration of the school in a biblical theme.”\n\n   No action was taken on the first charter for the remainder\nof the 2001-02 school year. During that time, Undis asked\nAnderson to make a decision on Truth’s application on at\nleast ten occasions, to no avail. Sometime in the spring semes-\nter of 2002, all ASB clubs were instructed to resubmit their\ncharters. The record does not reveal any further activity on\nTruth’s application during the summer and fall semesters of\n2002.\n\n   During this period, we decided Prince v. Jacoby, which\ninvolved a request by a Bible club for ASB recognition in a\ndifferent Washington school district. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779156\"><a href=\"/opinion/779156/tausha-prince-a-minor-by-and-through-her-parents-james-prince-kimberly/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n\f12448           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n2002). On January 7, 2003, an attorney for Truth, Robert\nTyler, wrote to Albrecht stating that it was “constitutionally\nimperative that [Kentridge] grant [appellants’] proposed Bible\nClub treatment and rights equal to all other noncurriculum\nclubs.” The letter also insisted that Kentridge “immediately\nadhere to the requirements of the Equal Access Act and the\nFirst Amendment,” and threatened litigation if Kentridge did\nnot comply.\n\n   On January 30, 2003, Tyler sent a second letter to Michael\nHarrington, counsel for the Kent School District. Tyler\nrequested the forms required to establish an ASB club, and\nthreatened litigation if Truth’s charter was not approved by\nFebruary 4.\n\n   On February 2, as requested by Anderson, Undis and Stew-\nart submitted a new application (second charter). The second\ncharter removed the quote-of-the-week and monthly theme\ndecoration provisions of the first charter. The club’s stated\npurpose was now to “provid[e] a biblically-based club for\nthose students interested in growing in their relationship with\nJesus Christ.” Although membership would be open to all stu-\ndents, the second charter restricted voting membership to\n“members professing belief in the Bible and in Jesus Christ.”\nOfficers would also be required to “believe in and be commit-\nted to biblical principles.”\n\n   After a third letter to Harrington from Tyler, the second\ncharter was discussed at an ASB Council meeting on March\n27. Some students expressed disapproval of the club’s name,\nsuggesting that it “implies that every other religion at Ken-\ntridge is a lie.” Some council members also expressed con-\ncerns that granting the charter would violate “[c]hurch and\nstate” and that the voting membership should be open to\neveryone. Additionally, members suggested that students\ncould go to “Young Life,” a non-ASB recognized organiza-\ntion that met on Kentridge’s campus after school hours. The\nminutes of the March 27 meeting reveal that the question of\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT            12449\nwhether to approve the second charter was discussed for\ntwenty minutes. No vote was taken.\n\n   The second charter was next addressed at an ASB Council\nmeeting on April 1. After a brief clarification on the role of\nthe advisor for the club, the minutes show that Anderson\nstated that if the ASB Council voted to approve the charter,\nhe would consult the District’s attorneys and Kentridge would\nmake a final decision on approving the charter. The Counsel\nvoted eleven to six against approval of Truth’s second charter.\n\n   On April 3, Truth filed a complaint in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington, alleg-\ning that defendants had violated the Act, as well as the First\nAmendment rights of free speech and expressive association,\nthe Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment Clause, and the\nEqual Protection Clause. Truth sought injunctive and declara-\ntory relief as well as nominal damages.\n\n   On April 9, Anderson sent Stewart a letter informing her of\nher right to resubmit Truth’s application for ASB club recog-\nnition: “As was discussed at the ASB meeting on March 28th,\nby making minor changes to Article[s] I and III of the pro-\nposed Constitution for your club, you will address the points\nraised.” Article I sets forth the name of the club and Article\nIII contains the voting membership and officer restrictions.\nAnderson advised Stewart to “be prepared to resubmit by the\nApril 25th ASB Meeting.” Under the Kentridge ASB Consti-\ntution, “[a]ny rejected charters must be resubmitted within\ntwo weeks of rejection with the required changes made or the\ncharter shall be permanently rejected.”\n\n  Stewart and Undis submitted the third charter on April 24.\nThe third charter maintains the proposed name “Truth.” How-\never, it divides the membership into three categories: voting\nmembers, non-voting members, and attendees. Meetings are\nopen to everyone. But the “privilege of membership is contin-\ngent upon the member complying in good faith with Christian\n\f12450            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\ncharacter, Christian speech, Christian behavior and Christian\nconduct as generally described in the Bible.” The charter\napplication also lists a “true desire to . . . grow in a relation-\nship with Jesus Christ” under the “Membership Criteria”\nheading. In order to be a voting member or officer, students\nare required to sign a “statement of faith.” The statement of\nfaith requires the person to affirm that he or she believes “the\nBible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative\nWord of God.” A voting member must also pledge that he or\nshe believes “that salvation is an undeserved gift from God,”\nand that only by “acceptance of Jesus Christ as my personal\nSavior, through His death on the cross for my sins, is my faith\nmade real.” Other than the ability to call oneself a “member,”\nthere is no difference between the rights of non-voting mem-\nbers and attendees.\n\n   The third charter was discussed at the April 25 ASB Coun-\ncil meeting. The ASB Council again objected to the name,\nselectivity provisions, and the presence of religion in school.\nThe council voted nineteen to zero to deny approval of the\ncharter, with one member undecided. The minutes give four\nreasons why the charter was not accepted: 1) “Name,”\n2) “Pledge to vote,” 3) “Segregating,” 4) “Religious club in\nschool.”\n\n   On May 6, Tyler wrote to the Kent School District’s coun-\nsel stating that it was his “understanding from the ASB Con-\nstitution that this rejection by the ASB is the final decision.”\nThe letter also provided that Tyler “was unable to locate any\nrights to appeal the decision of the ASB,” but that if there\nwere “a right to appeal the decision of the ASB,” he asked\nthat the letter “serve as a formal request for appeal.”\n\n   Anderson advised Undis and Stewart in a May 12 letter\n“that pursuant to Kent School District Policy 2340, [they had]\nthe ability to discuss this matter with Mr. Albrecht,” and men-\ntioned the possibility of discussions with the District superin-\ntendent or the ombudservices office. Although Tyler’s May 6\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12451\nletter would appear to have invoked these processes, no fur-\nther action was taken by the District. Policy 2340 concerns\n“religious related activities or practices.” The policy does not\nrefer to ASB recognition, and the ASB Constitution does not\nrefer to this policy as providing an avenue for an appeal of the\nDistrict’s decisions, which are otherwise “final.”\n\n  Although Undis and Stewart have both graduated from\nKentridge, they have indicated that another student, Lindsay\nThomas, is prepared to assume leadership of the club if the\ncharter is approved.\n\n   The Kent School District has three policies relevant to this\nappeal. First, Policy 3210 provides that “[t]he district will\nprovide equal educational opportunity and treatment for all\nstudents in all aspects of the academic and activities program.\nEqual opportunity and treatment is provided without regard to\nrace, creed, color, national origin, sex, marital status, previous\narrest . . . , incarceration, or physical, sensory or mental dis-\nabilities.” The district court held that inclusion of “creed”\nindicates that discrimination based upon religion is prohibited.\nThat ruling has not been challenged on appeal.\n\n   Second, Policy 2153 provides for “noncurriculum-related,\nnon ASB student groups,” which groups the principal shall\napprove provided they meet several additional requirements,\nsuch as that they do not disrupt the school environment.\nWhile Policy 2153 groups may meet on school grounds\nbefore or after school, these groups do not receive other bene-\nfits accorded only to ASB-sponsored student clubs. Most sig-\nnificantly, only ASB-chartered groups may receive ASB\nfunding and engage in purchasing through the Kent School\nDistrict Finance Department. Each ASB club is provided with\na faculty advisor or adult advisor designee, who must be pres-\nent at all club meetings and assists in the planning and han-\ndling of the club’s affairs. ASB clubs are also allowed to\nconduct meetings during noninstructional time, advertise their\nactivities in school, use the public address system, and are\n\f12452           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nrecognized in the school yearbook. The District states that\nTruth “is free to operate as a private Policy 2153 group,” but\nargues that Truth was properly denied ASB recognition.\n\n   Third, Policy 2340P regulates “religious related activities\nor practices,” and provides guidelines for schools addressing\nreligious holidays, symbols, ceremonies, topics, activities, and\nbeliefs. This policy also provides that “[s]tudents, parents, and\nemployees who are aggrieved by practices or activities con-\nducted in the school or district may seek resolution of their\nconcern first with the building principal, then with the district\nsuperintendent or designee, or use ombudservices, which is\navailable through the Legal Services Department.”\n\n   Washington State also has a relevant non-discrimination\nlaw, which the District relies on to justify its denial of ASB\nrecognition for Truth. In 2003, Washington Revised Code\n§ 49.60.215 (West 2006) provided that:\n\n    It shall be an unfair practice for any person or the\n    person’s agent or employee to commit an act which\n    directly or indirectly results in any distinction,\n    restriction, or discrimination, . . . or the refusing or\n    withholding from any person the admission, patron-\n    age, custom, presence, frequenting, dwelling, stay-\n    ing, or lodging in any place of public resort,\n    accommodation, assemblage, or amusement, except\n    for conditions and limitations established by law and\n    applicable to all persons, regardless of race, creed,\n    color, national origin, sexual orientation, sex, the\n    presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disabil-\n    ity, or the use of a trained dog guide or service ani-\n    mal by a disabled person.\n\nThe District has argued that these non-discrimination policies\nrequire it to deny ASB recognition to Truth.\n\n   As of April 3, 2003, there were thirty ASB-recognized\nclubs at Kentridge. While the record does not contain the\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12453\ncharters of all the clubs, it appears that many of them have\nselective membership criteria. Indeed, each charter applica-\ntion contains a section for “Membership Criteria.”\n\n   The EarthCorps, for example, requires members to show\n“interest and dedication toward environmental issues.” Simi-\nlarly, the Key Club requires that members be “interested in\nservice, qualified scholastically, of good character, possessing\nleadership potential . . . [and] willing to perform at least fifty\nhours of . . . service.” The Gay-Straight Alliance requires that\nstudents “must be willing to work towards the goals of the\nclub” to be members. These goals include “bring[ing]\nGLBTQ [Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered, and Ques-\ntioning] issues into the open, while working to decrease\nhomophobia.” Other goals include “changing stereotypes”\nand “fight[ing] heterosexism and other forms of oppression.”\nThe National Honor Society selects its members based on\n“outstanding scholarship, character, leadership, and service,”\nand requires them to “behave in a courteous and respectful\nmanner, refraining from language and actions that might bring\ndiscredit upon themselves.” It also requires members to\nrefrain from using or possessing alcohol or illegal substances.\nParticipation in school sports requires maintaining a certain\ngrade point average and attendance record, not using drugs or\nalcohol, and complying with the “sports code.” Finally, a\nMen’s Honor Club and a Girl’s Honor Club also operate at\nKentridge as ASB-recognized groups.

The\ncourt held that the requirements of municipal liability under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 were not satisfied, and therefore entered\nsummary judgment in favor of the District. It also held that\nthe actions against the individual defendants in their official\ncapacities were functionally equivalent to suits directly\n\f12454           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nagainst the municipality, and therefore Truth’s claims against\nthem failed.\n\n   The district court ruled on the merits of the Act and some\nof the First Amendment claims, addressing the latter as an\nalternate holding if its Monell ruling were to be reversed. It\nheld that the restrictions on general membership in the third\ncharter constituted a legitimate basis for denying the third\ncharter and that these claims therefore failed.\n\n   The district court did not rule on the remaining claims\nbased on its belief that “Plaintiffs’ cursory Equal Protection\nClause, Establishment Clause, and Free Exercise Clause argu-\nments are all subsumed within their First Amendment argu-\nment.” The district court also did not address the District’s\nargument that granting ASB recognition to Truth would vio-\nlate the Establishment Clause.\n\n  On appeal, both sides agree that only the third charter is\nbefore us. Truth makes this concession even though this\naction was filed before the third charter and its complaint only\naddresses the denial of its second charter.\n\n   This appeal requires us to review many determinations by\nthe district court.

The District’s standing argument therefore\ndoes not implicate Truth’s standing to seek nominal damages.\n\n   The District asserts that the Establishment Clause, state\nlaw, and its own non-discrimination policies mandate that it\ndeny ASB recognition to Truth. If the District believes that\nthree independent and binding legal authorities compel it to\ndeny Truth’s application, we do not see how the District\nmight approve the same or a similar charter request in the\nfuture.\n\n   [3] The District’s written non-discrimination policies also\nsupport Truth’s standing arguments. We have held that plain-\ntiffs “may demonstrate that an injury is likely to recur by\nshowing that the defendant had . . . a written policy, and that\nthe injury ‘stems from’ that policy. Where the harm alleged\nis directly traceable to a written policy there is an implicit\nlikelihood of its repetition in the immediate future.” Fortyune\nv. Am.

Here, the\nharm is traceable to the District’s policies, which the District\nhas argued compel it to deny ASB recognition to Truth.\n\n   Additionally, despite Tyler’s request that the District treat\nhis letter as a “formal request for appeal,” the District took no\naction. This is evidence that another charter request is likely\nto meet the same fate as the previous three. Finally, the Dis-\ntrict has provided nothing beyond its own speculation that the\noutcome might be different if Truth submitted a fourth char-\nter. The legal positions it has taken in this litigation strongly\nsuggest that no similar applications will ever be approved.\n\n   [4] Under these circumstances, we conclude that Truth has\nestablished at least a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12457\nwhether there is a reasonable expectation that the alleged\ninjury will recur. Therefore, Truth has standing to seek each\nof its requested forms of relief.\n\n   The District also suggests that this dispute is not ripe for\nreview, and that we thus lack jurisdiction, because Truth did\nnot bring the dispute to the Kent School District Board or\nSuperintendent through Policy 2340P. The District is wrong.\nThe Supreme Court has explicitly held that exhaustion is not\nrequired for claims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Stef-\nfel v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108985\"><a href=\"/opinion/108985/steffel-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472-73 (1974). Exhaustion\ncannot be dispositive under a ripeness analysis; otherwise\nripeness doctrine would impose a de facto exhaustion require-\nment, in violation of Steffel. Thus, the alleged failure to\nexhaust administrative remedies may be at most only a factor\nin the ripeness analysis.\n\n   [5] Nevertheless, it appears that Truth did exhaust the for-\nmal appeal system. Tyler’s May 6 letter to the District’s coun-\nsel asked that the letter “serve as a formal request for appeal.”\nThe District has not provided any reason why this notification\nwas not sufficient to trigger its appeals process, and no reason\nis apparent in the record. The District’s failure to take any\naction as a result of this request does not indicate that Truth\nfailed to bring the matter to the attention of the District. Under\nthese circumstances, there is at least a genuine issue of mate-\nrial fact as to whether Truth exhausted the District’s grievance\nprocedures.\n\n   Nearly every other factor suggests that this case is ripe for\ndecision. Under the Kentridge ASB Constitution, “[a]ny\nrejected charters must be resubmitted within two weeks of\nrejection with the required changes made or the charter shall\nbe permanently rejected.” The ASB Constitution neither pro-\nvides for any additional review, nor suggests that the ASB\nCouncil’s decision lacked finality.\n\n  Furthermore, there is no doubt that the effects of the denial\nof Truth’s charter have been felt in a concrete way by the\n\f12458           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nappellants. Truth’s members have experienced three denials\nof their applications, as well as protracted delays in obtaining\nany action from the ASB Council and District. The harm that\nTruth has complained of does not “rest[ ] upon contingent\nfuture events” or ones that “may not occur at all.” Texas v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118190\"><a href=\"/opinion/118190/texas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 300 (1998) (internal quotation\nomitted). Instead, Truth complains of discrete events that have\nalready occurred.\n\n   [6] Finally, “in evaluating ripeness, courts assess both the\nfitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to\nthe parties of withholding court consideration.” Ass’n of Am.\nMed. Colls. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769309\"><a href=\"/opinion/769309/association-of-american-medical-colleges-american-medical-association-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 779-80 (9th Cir.\n2000) (internal quotation omitted). We conclude the hardship\nto Truth in denying adjudication outweighs the hardship to the\nDistrict in deciding this appeal. Truth’s application for ASB\nrecognition languished for nearly sixteen months without any\nsignificant action being taken, and the ASB process appears\nto have stalled until Truth obtained counsel and threatened to\nsue. More than five years have passed since the submission of\nthe first charter, and declining to decide this appeal now\nwould present a significant hardship to appellants.\n\n   [7] By contrast, the hardship to the District is significantly\nless severe. The District has been aware of Truth’s arguments\nfor a long time and has had ample opportunity to take correc-\ntive action or change its policies, if it so desired. Its legal\npositions on appeal show that it does not believe any remedial\naction is appropriate and that it believes the denial of ASB\nrecognition was proper. We therefore conclude that this case\nis ripe for decision.\n\n                              III.\n\n  [8] We must also consider the district court’s ruling that the\nrequirements of Monell are not met. Monell permits section\n1983 actions against municipalities, but requires plaintiffs to\nshow that their injuries resulted from “execution of a govern-\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT              12459\nment’s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or\nby those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent\nofficial policy.” 436 U.S. at 694. Monell’s requirements do\nnot apply where the plaintiffs only seek prospective relief,\nwhich is the case here. See Chaloux v. Killeen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529825\"><a href=\"/opinion/529825/marie-chaloux-nancy-morgan-and-clarence-paine-individually-and-on-behalf/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n250-51 (9th Cir. 1989). The District acknowledges the con-\ntrolling effect of Chaloux, but argues that it should be over-\nruled because it “rests on shaky grounds.”\n\n  [9] It is well established in our circuit that while\n\n    a three judge panel normally cannot overrule a deci-\n    sion of a prior panel on a controlling question of law,\n    we may overrule prior circuit authority without tak-\n    ing the case en banc when an intervening Supreme\n    Court decision undermines an existing precedent of\n    the Ninth Circuit, and both cases are closely on\n    point.\n\nGalbraith v.

We have no authority\nto overrule Chaloux. Chaloux applies, and the district court’s\nMonell ruling is reversed.\n\n                              IV.\n\n  Relying on its non-discrimination policies, the District\npoints to three aspects of Truth’s third charter that justify its\ndecision to deny the club ASB recognition: 1) the general\nmembership restrictions, 2) the leadership and voting mem-\n\f12460            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nbership restrictions, and 3) the name “Truth.” The district\ncourt granted summary judgment based only on the first justi-\nfication, and explicitly declined to reach the other two.\nAccordingly, we too limit our analysis to the general member-\nship restrictions. So long as the District had at least one per-\nmissible basis for rejecting Truth’s charter, the district court\nproperly granted summary judgment, and we need not address\nthe District’s remaining justifications.\n\n   We begin our analysis by considering whether the District\nviolated the Act. If we determine that it did not, we then move\non to consider whether the District’s actions ran afoul of the\nFirst Amendment. See Prince v. Jacoby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779156\"><a href=\"/opinion/779156/tausha-prince-a-minor-by-and-through-her-parents-james-prince-kimberly/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1077\n(9th Cir. 2002) (“We consider each of Prince’s access claims\nseparately, first under the Act, and then the First Amendment,\nto the extent we find them outside the scope of the Act”).\n\n                               A.\n\n   [10] States have the constitutional authority to enact legis-\nlation prohibiting invidious discrimination.

Truth asserts that it does not\ndiscriminate based on religion in violation of the plain lan-\nguage of the District’s policies, but rather imposes a code of\nconduct not unlike those of other approved ASB clubs. Even\nassuming that non-Christians would be able to comply with\nTruth’s view of “Christian character, Christian speech, Chris-\ntian behavior and Christian conduct,” we hold that the\nrequirement that members possess a “true desire to . . . grow\nin a relationship with Jesus Christ” inherently excludes non-\nChristians.\n\n   [11] Having determined that the third charter violates the\nDistrict’s non-discrimination policies, we are led to hold that\nthe District’s denial of ASB recognition on this account\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT               12461\nwould be consistent with the Act.

The Dis-\ntrict does not argue that it is not required under the Act to\nprovide equal access to the ASB program.\n\n   In interpreting the Act, we begin with its plain language.\n“Where the intent of Congress has been expressed in reason-\nably plain terms, that language must ordinarily be regarded as\nconclusive.” Id. at 1079 (internal quotations and citation omit-\nted). Where there may be uncertainty, however, we rely on\nthe Supreme Court’s direction that the Act is to be “inter-\npreted broadly,” Mergens, 496 U.S. at 239, as well as cases\ndeciding analogous issues under the First Amendment. Cf.\nHsu v. Roslyn Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 3, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719595\"><a href=\"/opinion/719595/emily-hsu-and-timothy-hsu-by-and-through-their-next-friend-dr-chin-ching/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 855-\n56 (2d Cir. 1996) (adopting similar approach).\n\n   [12] By its plain terms, the Act prevents only denials of\naccess or fair opportunity or discrimination “on the basis of\nthe religious, political, philosophical, or other content of the\nspeech at [a club’s] meetings.” 20 U.S.C. § 4071(a). There-\nfore, once it is established that the secondary school receives\nfederal funds and has created a limited open forum, the club\nmust demonstrate two additional elements to prevail: 1) a\ndenial of equal access, or fair opportunity, or discrimination;\n2) that is based on the “content of the speech” at its meetings.\n\f12462              TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   [13] The District denied Truth ASB status, at least in part,\nbased on its discriminatory membership criteria, not the reli-\ngious “content of the speech.”1 The Act does not define “con-\ntent of the speech,” but that phrase has a particular meaning\nin First Amendment jurisprudence. We have held that\n“whether a statute is content neutral or content based is some-\nthing that can be determined on the face of it; if the statute\ndescribes speech by content then it is content based.” Menotti\nv.

Similarly, a “restriction on expres-\nsive activity is content-neutral if it is . . . based on a non-\npretextual reason divorced from the content of the message\nattempted to be conveyed.” Id. (quotations and citation omit-\nted).\n\n   The Act, through which Congress extended the reasoning\nof the Supreme Court’s 1981 decision in Widmar v. Vincent\nto secondary schools, see Mergens, 496 U.S. at 235, tracks\nWidmar’s emphasis on discrimination based on the content of\nthe plaintiff’s speech. Widmar struck down a state universi-\nty’s regulation prohibiting the use of university buildings or\ngrounds “for purposes of religious worship or religious teach-\ning.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110587\"><a href=\"/opinion/110587/widmar-v-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 265 (1981). Widmar thus precluded a uni-\nversity’s “discriminatory exclusion from a public forum based\non the religious content of a group’s intended speech,” id. at\n269-70, but not its “right to exclude . . . First Amendment\nactivities that violate reasonable campus rules.” Id. at 277.\nLikewise, the Act prevents a school’s unreasonable limitation\non the conduct of a club to the extent the limitation is justified\nwith reference to the expressive content of the regulated con-\nduct.

KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12463\n(1989) (“Government regulation of expressive activity is con-\ntent neutral so long as it is justified without reference to the\ncontent of the regulated speech” (internal quotations and cita-\ntion omitted)).\n\n   [14] Congress could have written the Act to protect reli-\ngious clubs against a burden on their speech or activities, but\ndid not. For example, when Congress passed the Religious\nLand Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, it not only pro-\nhibited discrimination against religious groups as such but\nalso limited governments’ abilities to impose even neutral,\nnondiscriminatory policies against them:\n\n    No government shall impose or implement a land\n    use regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial\n    burden on the religious exercise of a person, includ-\n    ing a religious assembly or institution, unless the\n    government demonstrates that imposition of the bur-\n    den on that person, assembly, or institution—\n\n         (A) is in furtherance of a compelling gov-\n         ernmental interest; and\n\n         (B) is the least restrictive means of further-\n         ing that compelling governmental interest.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000cc(a)(1). Thus, Congress knows how to draft\na statute placing otherwise content-neutral laws of general\napplicability that incidentally burden a First Amendment\nactivity under the same judicial scrutiny as laws specifically\ntargeting the religious content of a group’s expression. See\nGuru Nanak Sikh Soc’y of Yuba City v. County of Sutter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795229\"><a href=\"/opinion/795229/guru-nanak-sikh-society-of-yuba-city-v-county-of-sutter-casey-kroon-dennis/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">978</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 985-86 (9th Cir. 2006). That is not the case here.\nThe Act clearly allows exclusions that are not “content”-\nbased.\n\n   [15] The Act’s legislative history strengthens our conclu-\nsion that it prohibits only content-based restrictions on reli-\n\f12464            TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\ngious groups. The legislative history focuses on Congress’s\nintent to end school districts’ previous practices of treating\nreligious groups inequitably and forbidding them from meet-\ning on campus. See S. Rep. 98-357, at 6, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n2348, 2352 (1984) (“Despite Widmar, many school adminis-\ntrators across the country are prohibiting voluntary, student-\ninitiated religious speech as an [e]xtracurricular activity”); id.\nat 15, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2361 (“[S]chool authorities\nacross the country are banishing religious clubs from campus\nor placing such onerous restrictions on them that meetings\nbecome almost impossible”). The Senate Report recognized\nthe possibility that religious groups like Truth might claim\nthat content-neutral policies regulating club membership vio-\nlate the Act, and disclaimed any such intent:\n\n    At the same time, the guarantee of equal access does\n    not require special treatment for religious groups.\n    Religious groups are accorded only the same rights\n    and privileges as are granted to other student groups.\n    In practice, however, this means that not all student\n    groups would receive exactly the same privileges.\n    There could be many neutral and impartial time,\n    place, and manner restrictions placed on the use of\n    school facilities which might produce situations in\n    which some voluntary groups would not receive pre-\n    cisely the same access received by others. . . . The\n    access determination could not be made, however,\n    on the basis that the nature of the activity was reli-\n    gious.\n\nId. at 39, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2385. The District’s non-\ndiscrimination policies are not time, place or manner restric-\ntions. But like such restrictions, the policies are content-\nneutral. This strongly suggests that Congress did not intend\nthe Act to apply to non-discrimination policies.\n\n   [16] The parties do not dispute that the Kent School District\nreceives federal funding, or that Kentridge has created a lim-\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12465\nited open forum for extracurricular student groups. The Dis-\ntrict contests, however, whether the Act’s guarantee of equal\naccess, fair opportunity, and non-discrimination protects\nTruth’s freedom to exclude those who do not share Christian\nvalues from its general membership. On their face, the Dis-\ntrict’s non-discrimination policies do not preclude or discrimi-\nnate against religious speech. Truth also has not shown that\nthe District justifies its non-discrimination policies with refer-\nence to the content of a message Truth’s discriminatory con-\nduct may attempt to convey. The policies are content-neutral.\nTherefore, to the extent they proscribe Truth’s discriminatory\ngeneral membership restrictions, the policies do not implicate\nany rights that Truth might enjoy under the Act.

The court’s\ndecision in Hsu is readily distinguishable from the case at\nhand. In Hsu, a Christian group was seeking to impose a reli-\ngious test for all of its leadership positions. Id. at 849. The\ncourt held that the group’s ability to exclude non-Christians\nfrom some, but not all, of these leadership positions consti-\ntuted “speech” within the meaning of the Act. Id. at 858. In\ncontrast, we are only concerned with Truth’s general mem-\nbership requirements. The Second Circuit’s decision in Hsu\ndirectly supports our holding with respect to these require-\n\f12466              TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nments. The court held that “a religious test for membership or\nattendance” would be “plainly insupportable,” since “[i]t is\ndifficult to understand how allowing non-Christians to attend\nthe meetings and sing (or listen to) Christian prayers would\nchange the Club’s speech.” Id. at 858 & n.17.\n\n   [17] In short, Truth has not shown that the District’s non-\ndiscrimination policy restricts ASB status on the basis of reli-\ngion or the religious content of speech. Truth also argues,\nhowever, that the District violated the Act by allowing certain\ngroups an exemption from the non-discrimination policy. Here\nwe understand Truth to be challenging an allegedly arbitrary\nor discriminatory practice of granting waivers to non-religious\ngroups, but not religious groups. This challenge is different in\nkind from one asserting that the application of the non-\ndiscrimination policy to Truth violates Truth’s rights under\nthe Act. If indeed the District has a policy of enforcing the\nnon-discrimination policy only against religious groups, this\npolicy would of course violate the Act. Many of the so-called\n‘exemptions’ that Truth contests are in fact consistent with the\nDistrict’s non-discrimination policy. For example, several\nclubs, such as the EarthCorps and the Gay-Straight Alliance,\nrequire their members to support a specific political cause, but\nnothing in the District’s non-discrimination policy prohibits\ndiscrimination on the basis of political belief. However, at\nleast two groups, the Men’s Honor Club and the Girl’s Honor\nClub, were granted ASB recognition even though their mem-\nbership is based on gender, a protected ground under the Dis-\ntrict’s policy. There is no evidence in the record as to why\nthese groups were allowed apparent waivers from the Dis-\ntrict’s non-discrimination policy. Thus, to the extent Truth\nalleges that the District provided waivers to these groups\nwhile denying them to others, and that decision was made on\nthe basis of religion or the religious content of speech, Truth\nhas raised a triable issue of fact.2 Therefore, we reverse the\n  2\n   Although Truth has raised a triable issue of fact, we call attention to\ntwo potential problems with its argument. First, Congress has specifically\n\f                    TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT                     12467\ndistrict court’s summary judgment and remand for further\nproceedings on this limited issue.\n\n                                     B.\n\n   [18] We next address whether, and if so how, the First\nAmendment may apply where a school denies ASB recogni-\ntion to a student club based on its membership criteria. As an\ninitial matter, it is important to emphasize that the members\nof Truth are not seeking merely to associate as a group; they\nare seeking to associate as a school-sponsored group. Specifi-\ncally, ASB recognition would give Truth access to ASB\nfunds, additional access to the school’s property and facilities,\nand special rights to post materials around the school. There-\nfore, we must evaluate the District’s denial of ASB recogni-\ntion as a restriction on a “limited public forum.” See\nRosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117967\"><a href=\"/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 829 (1995) (applying limited public forum analysis to\nreligious group’s request for student activities funds); see also\nPrince, 303 F.3d at 1091 (holding that a school, through its\nASB program, “created a limited public forum”).\n\n  The limited public forum framework “has been the source\nof much confusion” and the precise contours of the term\n\nallowed for “separate but equal” gender discrimination in the context of\nschool and youth activities. See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6) (providing that\ngender discrimination is allowed with regard to certain social fraternities\nand sororities and volunteer youth organizations that have traditionally\nbeen limited to one sex). Therefore, that the District exempts the Men’s\nand Girl’s Honor Clubs from its overarching gender discrimination policy\ndoes not, by itself, suggest an arbitrary or discriminatory application of\nthat policy so as to violate the Act. Second, another high school and a\njunior high school in the District have granted ASB-recognition to other\nBible groups that do not discriminate in their membership criteria, making\nit even less likely that the District’s application of its anti-discrimination\npolicy in this case was merely a pretext for religious animus. Nevertheless,\nbecause the record is devoid of any evidence as to the actual reason that\nthe District granted a non-discrimination waiver to the Men’s and Girl’s\nHonor Clubs, we must remand for further proceedings.\n\f12468           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n“have not always been clear.” Hopper v. City of Pasco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772290\"><a href=\"/opinion/772290/janette-hopper-and-sharon-rupp-v-city-of-pasco-and-arts-council-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1067</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1074 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotations and cita-\ntion omitted). The Supreme Court first addressed the concept,\nindirectly, in Widmar. The Court recognized that, although\nthe state is not required to open certain fora to public dis-\ncourse, once it elects to do so, it “assume[s] an obligation to\njustify its discriminations and exclusions under applicable\nconstitutional norms.” Widmar, 454 U.S. at 267-68. Two\nyears later, in Perry Education Association v. Perry Local\nEducators’ Association, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110874\"><a href=\"/opinion/110874/perry-ed-assn-v-perry-local-educators-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44-45 (1983), the\nSupreme Court clarified that there are three categories of\ngovernment-run fora. “At one end of the spectrum are streets\nand parks which have immemorially been held in trust for the\nuse of the public.” Id. at 45 (internal quotations omitted). On\nthe opposite end of the spectrum are those government prop-\nerties that have not been traditionally considered open to the\npublic. Id. at 46. Finally, falling somewhere in between are\nlimited public fora, which “consist[ ] of public property which\nthe state has opened for use by the public as a place for\nexpressive activity.” Id. at 45.\n\n   [19] In Rosenberger, the Supreme Court held that the gov-\nernment may exclude speech in a “limited public forum,” so\nlong as its reasons for doing so are viewpoint neutral and\n“reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.” 515\nU.S. at 829 (quotations and citation omitted). Access to ASB\nrecognition qualifies as a limited public forum. See Prince,\n303 F.3d at 1091. Therefore, we must consider whether the\nDistrict’s policy of restricting access to the ASB forum based\non compliance with its non-discrimination policy is viewpoint\nneutral and reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum.\n\n   [20] The ASB Constitution makes it clear that the purpose\nof the organization “is to develop attitudes of and practice in\ngood citizenship within the school; to promote harmonious\nrelations between students, clubs, and activities; and to act as\na forum for student and faculty expression.” The constitution\nfurther states that this purpose will be carried out by\n\f                TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12469\n“[h]elping the student body develop a regard for law and\norder by obeying, honoring, and sustaining the laws of Wash-\nington State and King County, as well as the rules of Ken-\ntridge Senior High School. . . .” These broad statements of\npurpose show that the purpose of the ASB program is to\nadvance the school’s basic pedagogical goals. The Supreme\nCourt has emphasized that part of a school’s mission is to\ninstill in students the “shared values of a civilized social\norder,” which includes instilling the value of non-\ndiscrimination. See Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111979\"><a href=\"/opinion/111979/hazelwood-school-dist-v-kuhlmeier/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272 (1988). Therefore, the District’s decision to\nrestrict access to the ASB program based on a group’s will-\ningness to adhere to the school’s non-discrimination policy is\nreasonable in light of the purposes of the forum.\n\n   Because this policy was reasonable in light of the purposes\nserved by the ASB, we must next consider whether the\ngroup’s exclusion was viewpoint neutral. The Supreme Court\nhas explained that “[v]iewpoint discrimination is . . . an egre-\ngious form of content discrimination,” and occurs when “the\nspecific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of\nthe speaker is the rationale for the restriction.” Rosenberger,\n515 U.S. at 829 (emphasis added); see also Perry Educ.\nAss’n, 460 U.S. at 46 (regulation on access to a forum is not\nviewpoint neutral if it is “an effort to suppress expression\nmerely because public officials oppose the speaker’s view”).\nIn cases where restriction to the forum is based solely on the\ngroup’s religious viewpoint, the restriction is invalid. This\nwas the case in Prince, where the school refused to recognize\nthe school group World Changers “based purely on the\n[group’s] religious viewpoint.” 303 F.3d at 1091.\n\n   [21] Here, in contrast, the school is not denying Truth\naccess based solely on its religious viewpoint, but rather on\nits refusal to comply with the District’s non-discrimination\npolicy. The District was therefore not engaging in viewpoint\ndiscrimination; the “perspective of the speaker” was not the\n“rationale” for denying Truth access to the limited public\n\f12470           TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nforum. See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829. Applying the non-\ndiscrimination policy to exclude Truth does not show that the\nschool administrators acted “merely because [they] oppose\nthe speaker’s view.” Perry, 460 U.S. at 46. In short, the Dis-\ntrict no more engaged in viewpoint discrimination by exclud-\ning Truth for refusing to comply with its non-discrimination\npolicy than it would have engaged in viewpoint discrimina-\ntion by refusing to grant ASB status to a Student Pro-Drug\nClub that refused to obey the school’s anti-drug policy. Cf.\nMorse v. Frederick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145707\"><a href=\"/opinion/145707/morse-v-frederick/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2618</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2629 (2007) (holding that\nschools may censor even private student speech that occurs\non school grounds that “they reasonably regard as promoting\nillegal drug use”).\n\n   [22] This conclusion, of course, rests on the premise that\nthe ASB actually denied Truth’s recognition based on its fail-\nure to comply with the District’s non-discrimination policy.\nThere is evidence in the record that other groups, such as the\nMen’s and Girl’s Honor Clubs, were granted ASB recognition\ndespite violating the District’s non-discrimination policy.\nTherefore, to the extent Truth argues that it was denied an\nexemption from the non-discrimination policy based on the\ncontent of its speech, we hold it has raised a triable issue of\nfact, and reverse the district court’s summary judgment.\n\n                              V.\n\n   [23] Truth also makes a claim under the Free Exercise\nClause, the Establishment Clause, and the Equal Protection\nClause. The district court did not explicitly reach these\nclaims, on the grounds that Truth’s “cursory Equal Protection\nClause, Establishment Clause, and Free Exercise arguments\nare all subsumed within their First Amendment argument . . .\n.” On appeal, Truth continues to give cursory treatment to\nthese claims. Nevertheless, Truth may have a valid argument.\nAs discussed earlier, we are remanding to the district court to\ndetermine whether Truth was denied an exemption from the\nDistrict’s non-discrimination policy, and whether that denial\n\f                 TRUTH v. KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT             12471\nwas based on religion or the content of Truth’s speech. To the\nextent Truth can make out a colorable First Amendment vio-\nlation on these grounds, it may also have a Free Exercise\nclaim, since “the Supreme Court noted that free exercise\nclaims implicating other constitutional protections, such as\nfree speech, could qualify for strict scrutiny review . . . .” Am.\nFamily Ass’n v. City & County of San Francisco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776269\"><a href=\"/opinion/776269/american-family-association-inc-donald-wildmon-kerusso-ministries-family/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1114</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1124 (9th Cir. 2002). Moreover, if Truth can demon-\nstrate that it was singled out for unequal treatment on the\nbasis of religion, it may also have a potentially valid Equal\nProtection or Establishment Clause argument. Therefore, we\nremand these issues to the district court to be considered\nalong with the exemption issue discussed previously.\n\n   Finally, the District has argued that the ASB has free\nspeech rights that would be violated if it were compelled to\nrecognize Truth as an ASB organization. The ASB is not a\nparty to this appeal and there is no indication that the District\nhas authorization from the ASB to assert any such First\nAmendment claims. We conclude that the District lacks pru-\ndential standing to assert the ASB’s free speech rights. See\nKowalski v. Tesmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137732\"><a href=\"/opinion/137732/kowalski-v-tesmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129 (2004) (“[A] party\ngenerally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and\ncannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests\nof third parties.” (quotations and citation omitted)).\n\n                               VI.\n\n   It is prudent to address only those issues necessary for our\ndecision on the third charter application. We hold only that\nthe District did not violate the Act or Truth’s First Amend-\nment rights by applying its non-discrimination policy to\nrequire Truth to remove its general membership provision. To\nthe extent Truth alleges that the District violated the Act or\nthe First Amendment by refusing to provide an exemption to\nits non-discrimination policy—based on Truth’s religion or\nthe content of its speech—we reverse the district court’s sum-\nmary judgment, and remand for further proceedings.\n\f12472            TRUTH v.

Truth argued that it must be granted access\nto the ASB forum because conditioning its access to the ASB\nprogram on a change to its discriminatory membership policy\nwould infringe its right to engage in speech through “expres-\nsive association.” Expressive association may be burdened\nwhen the state requires a group to change its membership\ncriteria, see Boy Scouts of Am. v.

When\nthe use of school facilities is part of a general public forum,\ndenying access to those facilities may also implicate the right\nto associate freely. See Healy v.

As our opinion explains, when the state\ncreates a limited public forum, like the ASB program at issue\nhere, it may restrict access to that forum so long as the restric-\ntions are “viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the pur-\npose served by the forum,” even if these rules have the effect\nof limiting a group’s ability to engage in protected speech,\n\f                   TRUTH v.

Expressive association is simply another way of\nspeaking, only the group communicates its message through\nthe act of associating instead of through an act of “pure\nspeech” such as publishing, marching, speaking or perform-\ning. See Dale, 530 U.S. at 648 (holding that the First Amend-\nment protects a group’s ability to exclude members, if\nincluding such members would “impair the ability of the\ngroup to express those views, and only those views, that it\nintends to express”). There is no question that acts of expres-\nsive association are protected forms of speech under the First\nAmendment. See id. at 656; Hurley, 515 U.S. at 579. When\nthe state restricts access to a limited public forum in a way\nthat interferes with a group’s speech or expressive associa-\ntion, however, we apply the lesser standard of scrutiny, even\nif the same burden on a group’s rights outside a limited public\nforum would be subject to strict scrutiny. See Rosenberger,\n515 U.S. at 829-30 (applying limited public forum analysis to\na university policy that excluded a group’s access to the\nschool’s student activity fund, thereby preventing it from pub-\nlishing a newspaper). To hold otherwise would accord an act\nof “pure speech” such as publishing a newspaper — the core\nof what the First Amendment protects — less protection than\nan act of expressive association.

KENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\nhas the option of operating as a Policy 2153 group on school\ngrounds, see 524 F.3d at 963, and as such would be able to\nrestrict its membership unfettered by the school’s nondiscrim-\nination policy. If Truth wants the additional benefits that\ncome from participation in the ASB program, however, Truth\nmust comply with the school’s reasonable, viewpoint-neutral\nrules.\n\n\n\n\ning that a university group had shown that it was “reasonably likely to suc-\nceed on the merits” of its First Amendment claim after being excluded\nfrom campus for violating the school’s nondiscrimination policy, which\nthe group claimed infringed its right to expressive association. Although\nthe Seventh Circuit applied strict scrutiny in addressing this claim, it nota-\nbly stated that it could not even determine, on the limited record before\nit, whether the university had created an open, limited, or nonpublic\nforum. See id. at 866 (“Whether SIU’s student organization forum is a\npublic, designated public, or nonpublic forum is an inquiry that will\nrequire further factual development, and that is a task properly left for the\ndistrict court.”) Walker did not say that strict scrutiny would be appropri-\nate in all cases, even if the university had created something less than an\nopen forum.\n\f</pre>",
