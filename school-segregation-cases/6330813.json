(“Greensbrook”), Arete Real Estate &\n\nDevelopment (“Arete”), and Muduganti Reddy (“Reddy”). In six issues, AIC\n\fcontends that the trial court erred in determining contested fact issues at a proceeding\n\nunder Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 248,1 holding that AIC’s correction deed is\n\ninvalid and that Greensbrook is the legal owner of the real property at issue, granting\n\na summary judgment in favor of AT&T on its limitations defense, and awarding\n\nattorney’s fees.\n\n      We reverse and render in part and affirm in part.\n\n                                       Background\n\n      In 2011, AT&T filed a petition in interpleader,2 alleging that, in July 1991, its\n\npredecessor-in-interest,    Houston      Cellular    Telephone      Company       (“Houston\n\nCellular”), entered into a lease agreement (the “Lease”) with Texas Commerce Bank\n\n(“TCB”). Pursuant to the Lease, Houston Cellular leased from TCB, for $100.00\n\nper month and for an initial term of five months and renewable for four successive\n\nfive-year periods, real property in north Harris County, on which Houston Cellular\n\nconstructed and operated a cellular telephone antenna and transmission site (the “cell\n\ntower”). The Lease describes the property as a “50’ by 75’ parcel of land located in\n\nthe southwest corner of Block 3 Unrestricted, Reserve ‘C,’ 18.72 acres, which is\n\n\n1\n      See TEX. R. CIV. P. 248.\n2\n      “An interpleader is a suit to determine a right to property held by a disinterested\n      third party who is in doubt about ownership and who, therefore, deposits the\n      property with the trial court to permit interested parties to litigate ownership, letting\n      the court decide who is entitled to the funds and thereby avoiding the peril of\n      deciding ownership itself.” FCLT Loans Asset Corp. v. FirstCity Fin. Corp., 294\n      S.W.3d 661, 666 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.).\n                                              2\n\flocated at the southeast corner of Richey Road and West Hardy Road,” and includes\n\nan easement along the southern boundary of the 18.72-acre parcel. The Lease also\n\nprovides that the “rights under this Lease shall bind and inure to the benefit of\n\nLandlord, and Landlord’s heirs, successors, and assigns, and Tenant, and Tenant’s\n\nheirs, successors, and assigns.”\n\n      According to the record, in October 1991, TCB partially re-platted the 18.72-\n\nacre tract, creating a 0.6036-acre parcel, “Restricted Reserve A,” Block 1, out of\n\nNorthview Park, Section Two, recorded in the Harris County real property records\n\nat File N457142. It is this parcel, “Restricted Reserve A,” that is the subject of the\n\nLease and this lawsuit.\n\n      In 1994, TCB sold to Raymond G. Tiedje, several tracts of real property,\n\nincluding the 18.72-acre tract and “all of Restricted Reserve A, Block 1 of a partial\n\nreplat of Northview Park - Section Two, a subdivision of record under Harris County\n\nClerk’s File (H.C.C.F.) Number N457142, Harris County, Texas.”\n\n      In 1995, Tiedje sold to Houston North View Park, L.L.C. (“HNVP”) several\n\ntracts, again including the 18.72-acre tract and “all of Restricted Reserve A.” The\n\ndeed reflects that it was recorded in the Harris County real property records at clerk’s\n\nfile R256533, with a property description including Restricted Reserve A, at film\n\ncode number XXX-XX-XXXX.\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f      In August 1997, the 280th District Court of Harris County, in trial court case\n\nnumber 96-06869, signed a judgment in rem against HNVP, and in favor of Harris\n\nCounty Municipal Utility District #221 (“HCMUD”) and Aldine Independent\n\nSchool District (“Aldine ISD”), among others, for delinquent taxes for tax years\n\n1995 to 1996. The trial court ordered that several tracts or parcels of land belonging\n\nto HNVP be sold at a constable’s sale to satisfy the judgment, including the\n\n18.72-acre tract and all of Restricted Reserve A, by reference to the deed from Tiedje\n\nto HNVP, as follows: “18.72 acres of land, more or less, out of Abstract 982, Harris\n\nCounty, Texas, being more particularly described on Exhibit A to a special warranty\n\ndeed filed in the official deed records of Harris County, Texas under clerk’s file\n\nR256533 (at film code No. XXX-XX-XXXX) reference to such instrument and the legal\n\ndescription contained therein made herein for all purposes as if repeated verbatim.”\n\n      On January 27, 1998, the Constable, Precinct No. 4, of Harris County, Texas,\n\npursuant to the trial court’s August 11, 1997 judgment and on behalf of HCMUD\n\nand Aldine ISD, and others, posted for public sale the 18.72-acre tract, including\n\nRestricted Reserve A. The constable’s deed states that the property was “struck off”\n\nto HCMUD “for the use and benefit of itself and all other taxing units that established\n\ntax liens in Cause No. 96-06869.”\n\n      On May 28, 1998, HCMUD sold, “on behalf of itself and all taxing units that\n\nestablished tax liens on the property” in cause number 96-06869, the 18.72 acres,\n\n                                          4\n\fincluding Restricted Reserve A, to George R. Eeds. This sale was made subject to\n\ncertain provisions of the Texas Tax Code.3\n\n      In June 1998, Eads conveyed the 18.72-acre tract, including Restricted\n\nReserve A, back to HNVP. HNVP immediately conveyed the same property to\n\nKuturu Reddy, Trustee. And, Reddy immediately conveyed the same property to\n\nGreensbrook.\n\n      AT&T, in its interpleader petition, alleged that it became the successor-in-\n\ninterest to Houston Cellular with respect to the cell tower and the Lease. From 1998\n\nto 2011, AT&T made its lease payments to Greensbrook. In 2010, Greensbrook and\n\nAT&T renewed the Lease.\n\n      AT&T further alleged that, in April 2011, AIC appeared, claiming that it had\n\npurchased Restricted Reserve A in September 2000. AIC claimed a right to AT&T’s\n\npayments under the Lease for the preceding eleven years, and it threatened to\n\nterminate the Lease and deny AT&T access to its cell tower. AT&T requested to\n\ninterplead its Lease payments into the registry of the court. AT&T also brought a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration “as to the owner of the premises”\n\nand who, Greensbrook or AIC, was entitled to the Lease payments. In the event that\n\n\n\n3\n      See TEX. TAX CODE ANN. §§ 34.05 (including, “If property is sold to a taxing unit\n      that is a party to the judgment, the taxing unit may sell the property at any time by\n      public or private sale,” subject to any right of redemption of former owner); 34.21\n      (right of redemption) (West 2015).\n                                            5\n\fthe trial court deemed AIC to be the owner, AT&T requested a release of any liability\n\nto AIC for Lease payments prior to April 2011.\n\n      AIC brought a counterclaim against AT&T for breach of contract, asserting\n\nthat AT&T had breached the Lease by not making its payments to AIC. AIC sought\n\nto recoup AT&T’s Lease payments from September 2000 to 2011. AIC also brought\n\na cross-claim against Greensbrook, Reddy, and Arete, asserting that each was jointly\n\nand severally liable for falsely claiming that Greensbrook was the owner of the\n\nleased premises and diverting Lease payments that belonged to AIC.\n\n      AIC brought a “Declaratory Judgment Claim” against AT&T and\n\nGreensbrook, seeking a declaration that AIC’s Correction Deed was valid, that it\n\nvested superior title in Restricted Reserve A to AIC, and that Greensbrook and\n\nAT&T had no legal or equitable interest in the property. AIC also sought its\n\nattorney’s fees. AIC asserted that, in January 1998, “Aldine ISD and others” sued\n\nHNVP for delinquent taxes, and the final judgment was signed in November 1998.\n\nThe trial court, in its judgment, ordered the sale of Restricted Reserve A, the 0.6036-\n\nacre leased premises at issue and the property was sold at a constable’s sale on\n\nSeptember 5, 2000. On May 3, 2005, the Harris County, Precinct 4, Constable\n\nexecuted a Deed Under Order of Sale in Tax Suits, naming Aldine ISD as grantee.\n\nOn September 29, 2005, however, the constable executed a “Correction Deed,”\n\nremoving Aldine ISD and naming AIC as grantee.\n\n                                          6\n\f      AIC further brought a claim for unjust enrichment against AT&T and\n\nGreensbrook, seeking to recover all Lease payments that AT&T had made to\n\nGreensbrook after September 2000. AIC also asserted that, in the event that the trial\n\ncourt declared Greensbrook to be the owner of the property, it was entitled to\n\njudgment against AT&T and Greensbrook for AIC’s funds paid to purchase the\n\nproperty at the September 2000 tax sale and for property taxes.\n\n      Greensbrook asserted that AIC’s claims were barred by adverse possession.\n\nGreensbrook also brought a counterclaim against AIC for trespass to try title and an\n\naction to quiet title and remove a cloud, i.e., AIC’s Correction Deed.\n\n      The trial court ordered that AT&T deposit into the registry of the court the\n\ndisputed funds and all additional disputed amounts each month thereafter until a final\n\njudgment was signed. The trial court further ordered that the case continue on the\n\nmerits between AIC and Greensbrook to determine their respective rights to the\n\ndisputed funds and a determination of all claims by all parties.\n\n      AT&T then moved for a summary judgment on AIC’s breach-of-contract\n\nclaim, asserting that AIC was barred by limitations from recovering any Lease\n\npayments made prior to August 11, 2007, i.e., more than four years before AIC filed\n\nits counterclaim. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of AT&T on\n\nits limitations defense.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      The trial court denied Greensbrook’s and AIC’s motions for a summary\n\njudgment on the validity of AIC’s correction deed and title issues.\n\n      A week prior to trial, AT&T filed a “Rule 248 Motion Regarding Legal\n\nDetermination of the Validity of Claimants’ Deeds.” AT&T noted that Greensbrook\n\nhad demanded a jury trial and that Rule 248 required that the trial court determine\n\nall questions of law before the jury trial commenced. Greensbrook claimed title to\n\nthe property through its 1998 Special Warranty Deed, and AIC claimed title to the\n\nproperty through its 2005 Correction Deed. AT&T asserted that neither deed was\n\nambiguous, and it requested that the trial court rule on the “legal validity” of AIC’s\n\nand Greensbrook’s deeds, through which they each asserted an interest in the\n\ninterpleaded funds and the Lease, and strike the claim of any deed that “cannot\n\ntransfer an interest in real property.” AT&T asserted that “the scope of the trial may\n\nbe limited or the need for a trial may be eliminated in its entirety.” To its motion,\n\nAT&T attached Greensbrook’s deed, AIC’s Correction Deed, the original 2005 deed\n\nto Aldine ISD.\n\n      AIC responded, “The matters which may be addressed by Rule 248 are\n\nmatters such as motions in limine, the admission of uncontested evidence and the\n\nlike. The Court cannot rule on the validity of a deed that is not in evidence.”\n\n      At the hearing on AT&T’s “Rule 248 Motion,” AIC withdrew its opposition\n\nand asked the trial court to rule on the validity of its Correction Deed. AIC asserted\n\n                                          8\n\fthat “the deeds are before the Court as exhibits to AT&T’s motion.” The trial court\n\nthen considered the deeds and heard argument of the parties, as discussed below.\n\nThe trial court signed an “Order Construing the AIC Correction Deed Pursuant to\n\nRule 248,” in which it found that AIC’s Correction Deed “was subject to section\n\n5.029[4] of the Texas Property Code concerning Material Corrections and Correction\n\nInstruments” and did not substantially comply with the requirement that a correction\n\ninstrument be executed by each party to the recorded original instrument. The trial\n\ncourt held that AIC’s Correction Deed was invalid as a matter of law.\n\n      Subsequently, at the beginning of trial, Greensbrook waived its demand for a\n\njury trial, and the parties agreed to try the case to the court. Greensbrook non-suited\n\nits trespass-to-try-title claim and AIC informed the trial court that it “ha[d] not\n\nbrought a trespass-to-try-title claim.” The trial court denied AIC’s motion for leave\n\nto amend its pleadings to assert an equitable title claim.\n\n      The trial court then admitted into evidence, inter alia, a copy of the Lease and\n\ncopies of the deeds, discussed above, from each party and heard argument. The trial\n\ncourt ruled that AIC’s declaratory judgment claim was resolved by its finding that\n\nAIC’s Correction Deed was invalid as a matter of law, that “Greensbrook has\n\nsuperior title to AIC,” and that AT&T did not breach a contract with AIC. At a\n\n\n\n\n4\n      See TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 5.029 (West 2014)\n                                           9\n\fsubsequent hearing, counsel for Greensbrook testified regarding its attorney’s fees\n\nas to AIC’s declaratory judgment claim.\n\n      The trial court, in its final judgment, after noting that it had previously found\n\nthat AIC’s Correction Deed was invalid, declared that Greensbrook is the “legal\n\nowner” of the property and ordered that AIC’s Correction Deed not cloud\n\nGreensbrook’s title. With respect to AIC’s breach-of-contract claim, the trial court\n\nheld that AIC take nothing. With respect to AIC’s claim for unjust enrichment, the\n\ntrial court awarded AIC, out of the court registry, damages in the amount of\n\n$39,795.82. The trial court awarded the balance of the funds in the registry to\n\nGreensbrook. The trial court further awarded Greensbrook attorney’s fees in the\n\namount of $65,000.00 through trial, $15,000.00 through appeal, $7,500.00 through\n\na petition to the supreme court, and $10,000.00 for briefing and argument in the\n\nsupreme court.5\n\n                          Validity of the Correction Deed\n\n      In its sixth issue, AIC argues that the trial court erred by determining the\n\nvalidity of its deed, which it characterizes as a “contested factual issue,” at a\n\nproceeding under Rule of Civil Procedure 248. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 248. In its third\n\nissue, AIC asserts that the trial court erred by holding that its Correction Deed is\n\n\n\n5\n      The trial court did not, despite request by AIC, file findings of fact and conclusions\n      of law. AIC does not, however, complain on appeal.\n\n                                            10\n\finvalid. In its second issue, AIC argues that the trial court erred by “invalidating a\n\ndeed to Aldine ISD.”\n\n      1.     Rule 248 Proceeding\n\n      AIC asserts that “immediately prior to the scheduled jury trial, AT&T filed a\n\nRule 248 motion on a single issue—the validity of AIC’s correction deed.” AIC\n\nasserts that the trial court was “misdirected” to consider the validity of AIC’s\n\nCorrection Deed before considering the “entire chain of title.”\n\n      A trial court has inherent power to control the resolution of cases on its docket\n\nand is granted wide discretion to conduct trial as it deems appropriate. Dow Chem.\n\nCo. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 240 (Tex. 2001); Bohls v. Oakes, 75 S.W.3d 473,\n\n476 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, pet. denied). Rule 248 provides: “When a jury\n\ntrial has been demanded, questions of law . . . and other unresolved pending matters\n\nshall, as far as practicable, be heard and determined by the court before the trial\n\ncommences. . . .” TEX. R. CIV. P. 248. “The construction of an unambiguous deed\n\nis a question of law for the court.” Luckel v. White, 819 S.W.2d 459, 461 (Tex.\n\n1991).\n\n      Here, AT&T filed a “Rule 248 Motion Regarding Legal Determination of the\n\nValidity of Claimants’ Deeds,” asserting that the “trial of this interpleader dispute,\n\nas well as certain subsidiary claims,” was set for the following week. AT&T\n\nrequested that the trial court rule on the “legal validity” of AIC’s and Greensbrook’s\n\n                                         11\n\fdeeds and strike the claim of any deed that “cannot transfer an interest in real\n\nproperty.” AT&T asserted that neither deed was ambiguous and, with respect to\n\nAIC’s Correction Deed, the issue presented was whether it complied with the\n\nrequirements under the Texas Property Code, discussed below, that a correction\n\ninstrument be executed by each party to the recorded original instrument. AT&T\n\nnoted that both AIC and Greensbrook had each previously, through respective\n\nmotions for summary judgment, asserted that it was entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law on its claim of title to the property and that there existed no genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact.\n\n      The record of the hearing on AT&T’s “Rule 248 Motion” reflects that AIC\n\nsimilarly requested that the trial court determine the validity of its deed as a matter\n\nof law:\n\n      [AT&T]:              . . . . The Court has heard summary judgment\n                           motions from both of the parties and the most recent\n                           of which was AIC’s motion regarding the correction\n                           deed. During that hearing the Court made some\n                           comments about whether or not that correction deed\n                           met the statute for correction deeds and whether it\n                           contained the signatures it needed . . . .\n      THE COURT:           . . . . This was AIC’s[?]\n      [AT&T]:              Yes, Your Honor. And so in light of the fact that\n                           we are set for trial and because of the scope of the\n                           trial really hinges on whether or not AIC’s\n                           deed . . . is a valid deed—\n      THE COURT:           Well, it’s either—it’s either valid or not, right?\n\n\n                                          12\n\f[AT&T]:      Exactly right. And so we wanted to bring that to the\n             Court’s attention. AT&T doesn’t take a position on\n             whether or not it’s valid, . . . but we want the Court\n             to rule on it before the trial begins.\n[AIC]:       . . . . And the idea of having a ruling on the validity\n             of the deeds in question I think would be helpful for\n             the parties in trying the case and could abbreviate\n             the trial. What I’m concerned about is the state of\n             the record on which the Court’s ruling would be\n             based should it find, for example, AIC’s deed to be\n             either valid or invalid.\n             We have presented many number of exhibits in our\n             motion for summary judgment in order to establish\n             through the chain of title that the constable’s deed\n             was for the property on which the AT&T tower is\n             situated so that we would have a clear record and\n             show that our deed was—involved that property.\n             That’s the biggest thing that I care about on a ruling\n             on the validity or invalidity is to make sure that the\n             record is clear that that deed pertains to the realty\n             upon which AT&T’s cell tower is situated and that\n             is made the subject of the lease into which AT&T\n             had entered. That’s all I care about, Judge.\nTHE COURT:   But I’m not sure I quite understand what you’re\n             saying. If the Court is going to make a legal\n             determination regarding the validity of a specific\n             deed, like a corrected deed, I’m looking—and\n             without making any other ancillary rulings, chain of\n             title or who owns the property, that kind of thing,\n             but I—if you give me the deed, apply whatever\n             sections of the property code I need to apply, I can\n             tell you right then and there it’s material, not\n             material, it complies, doesn’t comply and it’s a good\n             deed, bad deed, right?\n[AIC]:       I think so.\n....\n\n\n\n                            13\n\f                          . . . . And it doesn’t really matter what the state of\n                          the record is on the predicate transactions. It is just\n                          is that deed a valid deed or invalid deed.\n      THE COURT:          Right and I’m not—\n      [AIC]:              And thinking through that with your assistance,\n                          Judge, I think that makes sense, and I’m okay with\n                          that.\n      ....\n                          I agree that the Court can rule on whether or not the\n                          deed is a valid or invalid deed as a matter of law. I\n                          think the deeds are before the Court as exhibits to\n                          AT&T’s motion, and I’ll withdraw the opposition\n                          that AIC had to that motion and ask that the Court\n                          rule on the validity or invalidity of the deeds that are\n                          attached to AT&T’s motion.\n\n      Thus, the record shows that, not only did AIC not object to the trial court\n\nmaking a ruling on the issue of the validity of its deed, but AIC affirmatively\n\nrequested a ruling from the trial court on the issue. Accordingly, the issue is waived.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a) (requiring that complaints be made in trial court as\n\nprerequisite for appellate review); see also Tittizer v.

At the pre-trial hearing, AIC agreed that the issue of the validity of its\n\ncorrection deed involved only a question of law. Nothing in the record reflects that\n\nthe trial court treated AT&T’s motion as a motion for summary judgment or\n\nprevented AIC from presenting argument or evidence to support its position. The\n\ntrial court’s written order and final judgment also reflect that the trial court acted\n\npursuant to Rule 248.

PROP.

A correction instrument replaces and is a substitute for the original\n\ninstrument. See id. § 5.030(b).\n\n      Here, it is undisputed that AIC’s Correction Deed, which substitutes AIC as\n\ngrantee, was not executed by Aldine ISD, the grantee in the original 2005 instrument.\n\n      We first note that section 5.028 provides that “clerical errors,” “including an\n\naddition, correction, or clarification of a party’s name, including the spelling of a\n\nname, a first or middle name or initial, a suffix, an alternate name by which a party\n\nis known, or a description of an entity as a corporation, company, or other type of\n\norganization,” constitute “nonmaterial” corrections. See id. § 5.028(a)(2)(A). At\n\nissue in this case, however, is not a correction to the spelling of a party’s name, but\n\na substitution of an entirely different party as grantee. See, e.g., Jackson v. Brackins,\n\n409 S.W.2d 482, 484 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1966, writ ref’d n.r.e.)\n\n(distinguishing between change in grantee name and change in grantee); Starks v.\n\nLoftus, 248 S.W. 1090, 1094 (Tex. Civ. App.—Galveston 1922, no writ) (change in\n\n                                           19\n\fspelling of grantee name immaterial as undisputed evidence showed that same\n\ngrantee was intended).\n\n      Although we recognize that section 5.029 does not expressly contemplate a\n\nchange in a grantee to be a “material” correction within the statute, the statute\n\nemploys, before its enumerated list, the term “including.” See TEX. PROP. CODE\n\nANN. § 5.029 (“[P]arties to the original transaction, or the parties’ heirs, successors,\n\nor assigns, may execute a correction instrument to make a ‘material’ correction to\n\nthe recorded original instrument of conveyance, ‘including’ a correction to: [list].”).\n\nGenerally, “‘[i]ncludes’ and ‘including’ are terms of enlargement and not of\n\nlimitation or exclusive enumeration, and use of the terms does not create a\n\npresumption that components not expressed are excluded.” TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN.\n\n§ 311.005 (West 2013) (“Code Construction Act”).\n\n      More importantly, the record shows that AIC did not dispute in the trial court\n\nthat the change in the grantee in this case constituted a material correction governed\n\nby section 5.029:\n\n      THE COURT:           . . . [W]hat section of the Property Code are we\n                           talking about?\n      ....\n      [Greensbrook]:       . . . I think we’re all under the assumption that a new\n                           named grantee, completely new person, would be a\n                           5.029 correction instrument with the material\n                           correction.\n      [AIC]:               Correct.\n\n                                          20\n\f      ....\n      THE COURT:          Okay. So everybody is in agreement that this is a\n                          5.029; that is, it’s a material correction because\n                          we’re changing who the grantee is?\n      [AIC]:              Yes, sir.\n\n      Further, AIC did not dispute that section 5.029 requires that an instrument\n\nmaking a material correction be “executed by each party to the recorded original\n\ninstrument of conveyance the correction instrument is executed to correct or, if\n\napplicable, a party’s heirs, successors, or assigns.”       TEX. PROP. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 5.029(b)(1).\n\n      AIC argued in the trial court, as it does so on appeal, that, notwithstanding the\n\nlack of a signature by Aldine ISD on the Correction Deed, substantial compliance\n\nwith section 5.029 is sufficient. At the hearing, the following discussion took place:\n\n      THE COURT:          Okay. And so—under 5.029(b) it would have\n                          needed to have been recorded by—it would need to\n                          have been executed by Hickman and Aldine ISD;\n                          right?\n      [Greensbrook]:      That’s correct, Judge.\n      [AIC]:              Except that the Court was referred to a subsequent\n                          section in the Property Code, the number of which\n                          escapes me, where it recognizes that correction\n                          deeds that were recorded before the effective date\n                          of the statute have to, quote, substantially comply\n                          with the requirements of the material change\n                          provision. And our argument was that ours\n                          substantially complied because substantial\n                          compliance necessarily means something less than\n                          perfect compliance.\n      THE COURT:          And I have had this discussion before.\n                                         21\n\f      ....\n                         And the problem I have is there really is no\n                         substantial compliance as it complies to that section.\n                         That isn’t the same thing because how can you\n                         have—how can you deed a property to a grantee and\n                         then a subsequent deed come and—this claim that\n                         that property interest from that person without\n                         getting their assent and that be something that the\n                         law would sanction, right? Otherwise someone\n                         could sell a piece of property, go in, they get the\n                         property, and then two months later say, okay, file\n                         a correction deed and then give it to somebody else\n                         and just keep doing that over and over and it would\n                         be okay under the law because they’re just\n                         correction deeds.\n      [AIC]:             And that’s what the Court pointed out at the hearing\n                         on the motion for summary judgment. And I\n                         understand the Court’s feelings about it. And I think\n                         we’re just ready for the Court to say yea or nay, it’s\n                         valid or invalid.\n      THE COURT:         Okay. I wanted to make sure I ran through the traps\n                         and I wasn’t thinking about some other section in it\n                         or some other issue.\n      [AIC]:             You’re spot on on what this is all about.\n\n      Property Code section 5.031 states that\n\n       A correction instrument recorded before September 1, 2011, that\n      substantially complies with Section 5.028 or 5.029 and that purports to\n      correct a recorded original instrument of conveyance is effective to the\n      same extent as provided by Section 5.030 unless a court of competent\n      jurisdiction renders a final judgment determining that the correction\n      instrument does not substantially comply with Section 5.028 or 5.029.\n\nTEX.

Lime\n\nLtd., 291 S.W.3d 392, 403 (Tex. 2009) (“[S]ubstantial compliance with a statute\n\nmeans compliance with its essential requirements.”).\n\n      This Court has held, however, that the requirement that each party to the\n\nrecorded original instrument execute the correction deed is “essential to fulfilling\n\nthe Legislature’s standard for permitting a material correction” under section 5.029.\n\nSee Tanya L. McCabe Trust, 531 S.W.3d at 794 (discussing genesis of statute and\n\nMyrad Props. v. Lasalle, 300 S.W.3d 746 (Tex. 2009)).\n\n      Because AIC’s Correction Deed was not executed by Aldine ISD, the grantee\n\nin the original instrument, or by its successors or assigns , the Correction Deed does\n\nnot comply with section 5.029, as a matter of law, and is invalid. See Tanya L. McCabe\n\nTrust, 531 S.W.3d at 799 (holding correction instruments that did not comply with\n\nsection 5.029 to be invalid). We hold that the trial court did not err in holding that\n\nAIC’s Correction Deed is invalid.\n\n      With respect to AIC’s assertion that the trial court lacked “jurisdiction to\n\ndeclare Aldine ISD’s judgment or deed void,” nothing in the trial court’s judgment\n\ndeclares void any deed held by Aldine ISD. As AIC notes in its brief, Aldine ISD is\n\n                                         23\n\fnot a party to this appeal. The trial court held only that AIC’s Correction Deed is\n\ninvalid.\n\n      We overrule AIC’s second, third, and sixth issues.\n\n      Having held that AIC’s Correction Deed is invalid, we do not reach AIC’s\n\nfourth issue, in which it asserts that the trial court erred in granting AT&T summary\n\njudgment on its limitations defense, with respect to AIC’s breach-of-contract claim\n\nbased on payments allegedly owed under the Lease.\n\n                            Adjudication of Ownership\n\n      In its first issue, AIC argues that the trial court erred in determining that\n\nGreensbrook is the legal owner of the real property at issue because its ownership\n\ninterest arises from a transfer during the pendency of a tax suit. Greensbrook\n\nresponds that it established its title by adverse possession, as an affirmative defense\n\nto AIC’s declaratory action.\n\n      “Disputes based on claims of superior title are trespass to try title actions.”\n\nJinkins v.

To prevail\n\nin a trespass-to-try-title action, a plaintiff must establish (1) a regular chain of\n\nconveyances from the sovereign, (2) superior title out of a common source, (3) title\n\nby limitations, or (4) title by prior possession coupled with proof that possession was\n\nnot abandoned.

AIC did not expressly plead a trespass-to-try-title\n\nclaim, and it emphasized in the trial court that it “ha[d] not brought a trespass to try\n\ntitle action.”    Although Greensbrook pleaded a trespass-to-try title claim, it\n\nnon-suited its claim at trial. Instead, AIC brought a claim under the Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act (“DJA”), seeking, as pertinent here, a declaration that it has superior\n\ntitle to Restricted Reserve A and that Greensbrook does not have a legal or equitable\n\n                                           25\n\finterest in the property.

Lee, 393 S.W.3d 467, 474–75 (Tex.

(quoting TEX. PROP. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 22.001(a)). The DJA, however, provides that “[a] person interested under a deed,\n\nwill, written contract, or other writings . . . may have determined any question of\n\nconstruction or validity arising under the instrument . . . and obtain a declaration of\n\nrights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.” Id. (quoting TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\n\nREM. CODE § 37.004(a)).         These statutes differ in their pleading and proof\n\nrequirements, and only the DJA allows a recovery of attorney’s fees.

Notwithstanding, because AIC and Greensbrook dispute\n\ntitle to the property, their claims fall within the category of claims required to be\n\nbrought in trespass-to-try-title actions. See Jinkins, 522 S.W.3d at 786; see also\n\nCoinmach, 417 S.W.3d at 926; I–10 Colony, 393 S.W.3d at 474–75. This Court,\n\nand others, have held that when declaratory claims can be characterized as claims\n\nfor trespass-to-try-title, we analyze the case as a trespass-to-try-title case. See Mid\n\nPac Portfolio, LLC, 2016 WL 828150, at *4; I-10 Colony, Inc., 393 S.W.3d at 476\n\n(“We simply interpret the declaratory judgment request as a trespass-to-try-title\n\naction.”); see also Tex.

(“It is well settled that Texas courts consider the\n\nsubstance and not the form of pleadings to determine whether an action is properly\n\nconsidered as a trespass to try title suit.”).\n\n       Here, in response to AIC’s claim of title, Greensbrook asserted in its answer,\n\nas an affirmative defense, that “AIC’s claims are barred by various statutes of\n\nlimitation applicable to recover real property held in peaceable and adverse\n\npossession.” In its prayer, Greensbrook asked that the trial court render a take-\n\nnothing judgment against AIC. Thus, Greensbrook did not seek affirmative relief;\n\nrather, it simply asked for a denial of the relief sought by AIC. See West v. Pugh,\n\nNo. 01-12-00133-CV, 2013 WL 3327287, at *6 (Tex.

Katar Corp., 961 S.W.2d 324, 328 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no pet.). To determine whether an unpleaded issue\n\nwas tried by consent, we examine the record not for evidence of the issue, but rather\n\nfor evidence of trial of the issue. See Pickelner v. Adler, 229 S.W.3d 516, 523 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. denied).\n\n      Greensbrook asserts that it raised the issue of its limitations title at trial, as\n\nfollows:\n\n      However, to that end, I can show in my title that I have had title\n      sufficient to win both by both predating or anti-dating the Reddy\n      Greensbrook and also I show it by limitations title, which I have\n      mentioned.\n\nThis, without more, however, does not reflect that the parties understood that the\n\nissue of adverse possession was in the case and actually tried. See id.\n\n      Because the record does not reflect that Greensbrook requested affirmative\n\nrelief on its adverse possession claim, we hold that the trial court erred in declaring\n\nGreensbrook the legal owner of the property through adverse possession.\n\n      We sustain AIC’s first issue.\n\n      Because we have sustained the error in the ruling favoring Greensbrook, we\n\nalso sustain AIC’s fifth issue, in which it argues that the trial court erred in awarding\n\nGreensbrook attorney’s fees because such fees are barred in a trespass-to-try-title\n\naction. The recovery of attorney’s fees in trespass-to-try-title actions is barred\n                                           29\n\fbecause, with a limited exception for boundary disputes between adjoining\n\nproperties, Property Code chapter 22 does not provide for them.

The Lease also\n\nprovides that the “rights under this Lease shall bind and inure to the benefit of\n\nLandlord, and Landlord’s heirs, successors, and assigns, and Tenant, and Tenant’s\n\nheirs, successors, and assigns.”\n\n      According to the record, in October 1991, TCB partially re-platted the 18.72-\n\nacre tract, creating a 0.6036-acre parcel, “Restricted Reserve A,” Block 1, out of\n\nNorthview Park, Section Two, recorded in the Harris County real property records\n\nat File N457142. It is this parcel, “Restricted Reserve A,” that is the subject of the\n\nLease and this lawsuit.\n\n      In 1994, TCB sold to Raymond G. Tiedje, several tracts of real property,\n\nincluding the 18.72-acre tract and “all of Restricted Reserve A, Block 1 of a partial\n\nreplat of Northview Park - Section Two, a subdivision of record under Harris County\n\nClerk’s File (H.C.C.F.) Number N457142, Harris County, Texas.”\n\n      In 1995, Tiedje sold to Houston North View Park, L.L.C. (“HNVP”) several\n\ntracts, again including the 18.72-acre tract and “all of Restricted Reserve A.” The\n\ndeed reflects that it was recorded in the Harris County real property records at clerk’s\n\nfile R256533, with a property description including Restricted Reserve A, at film\n\ncode number XXX-XX-XXXX.\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f      In August 1997, the 280th District Court of Harris County, in trial court case\n\nnumber 96-06869, signed a judgment in rem against HNVP, and in favor of Harris\n\nCounty Municipal Utility District #221 (“HCMUD”) and Aldine Independent\n\nSchool District (“Aldine ISD”), among others, for delinquent taxes for tax years\n\n1995 to 1996. The trial court ordered that several tracts or parcels of land belonging\n\nto HNVP be sold at a constable’s sale to satisfy the judgment, including the\n\n18.72-acre tract and all of Restricted Reserve A, by reference to the deed from Tiedje\n\nto HNVP, as follows: “18.72 acres of land, more or less, out of Abstract 982, Harris\n\nCounty, Texas, being more particularly described on Exhibit A to a special warranty\n\ndeed filed in the official deed records of Harris County, Texas under clerk’s file\n\nR256533 (at film code No. XXX-XX-XXXX) reference to such instrument and the legal\n\ndescription contained therein made herein for all purposes as if repeated verbatim.”\n\n      On January 27, 1998, the Constable, Precinct No. 4, of Harris County, Texas,\n\npursuant to the trial court’s August 11, 1997 judgment and on behalf of HCMUD\n\nand Aldine ISD, and others, posted for public sale the 18.72-acre tract, including\n\nRestricted Reserve A. The constable’s deed states that the property was “struck off”\n\nto HCMUD “for the use and benefit of itself and all other taxing units that established\n\ntax liens in Cause No. 96-06869.”\n\n      On May 28, 1998, HCMUD sold, “on behalf of itself and all taxing units that\n\nestablished tax liens on the property” in cause number 96-06869, the 18.72 acres,\n\n                                          4\n\fincluding Restricted Reserve A, to George R. Eeds. This sale was made subject to\n\ncertain provisions of the Texas Tax Code.3\n\n      In June 1998, Eads conveyed the 18.72-acre tract, including Restricted\n\nReserve A, back to HNVP. HNVP immediately conveyed the same property to\n\nKuturu Reddy, Trustee. And, Reddy immediately conveyed the same property to\n\nGreensbrook.\n\n      AT&T, in its interpleader petition, alleged that it became the successor-in-\n\ninterest to Houston Cellular with respect to the cell tower and the Lease. From 1998\n\nto 2011, AT&T made its lease payments to Greensbrook. In 2010, Greensbrook and\n\nAT&T renewed the Lease.\n\n      AT&T further alleged that, in April 2011, AIC appeared, claiming that it had\n\npurchased Restricted Reserve A in September 2000. AIC claimed a right to AT&T’s\n\npayments under the Lease for the preceding eleven years, and it threatened to\n\nterminate the Lease and deny AT&T access to its cell tower. AT&T requested to\n\ninterplead its Lease payments into the registry of the court. AT&T also brought a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration “as to the owner of the premises”\n\nand who, Greensbrook or AIC, was entitled to the Lease payments. In the event that\n\n\n\n3\n      See TEX. TAX CODE ANN. §§ 34.05 (including, “If property is sold to a taxing unit\n      that is a party to the judgment, the taxing unit may sell the property at any time by\n      public or private sale,” subject to any right of redemption of former owner); 34.21\n      (right of redemption) (West 2015).\n                                            5\n\fthe trial court deemed AIC to be the owner, AT&T requested a release of any liability\n\nto AIC for Lease payments prior to April 2011.\n\n      AIC brought a counterclaim against AT&T for breach of contract, asserting\n\nthat AT&T had breached the Lease by not making its payments to AIC. AIC sought\n\nto recoup AT&T’s Lease payments from September 2000 to 2011. AIC also brought\n\na cross-claim against Greensbrook, Reddy, and Arete, asserting that each was jointly\n\nand severally liable for falsely claiming that Greensbrook was the owner of the\n\nleased premises and diverting Lease payments that belonged to AIC.\n\n      AIC brought a “Declaratory Judgment Claim” against AT&T and\n\nGreensbrook, seeking a declaration that AIC’s Correction Deed was valid, that it\n\nvested superior title in Restricted Reserve A to AIC, and that Greensbrook and\n\nAT&T had no legal or equitable interest in the property. AIC also sought its\n\nattorney’s fees. AIC asserted that, in January 1998, “Aldine ISD and others” sued\n\nHNVP for delinquent taxes, and the final judgment was signed in November 1998.\n\nThe trial court, in its judgment, ordered the sale of Restricted Reserve A, the 0.6036-\n\nacre leased premises at issue and the property was sold at a constable’s sale on\n\nSeptember 5, 2000. On May 3, 2005, the Harris County, Precinct 4, Constable\n\nexecuted a Deed Under Order of Sale in Tax Suits, naming Aldine ISD as grantee.\n\nOn September 29, 2005, however, the constable executed a “Correction Deed,”\n\nremoving Aldine ISD and naming AIC as grantee.\n\n                                          6\n\f      AIC further brought a claim for unjust enrichment against AT&T and\n\nGreensbrook, seeking to recover all Lease payments that AT&T had made to\n\nGreensbrook after September 2000. AIC also asserted that, in the event that the trial\n\ncourt declared Greensbrook to be the owner of the property, it was entitled to\n\njudgment against AT&T and Greensbrook for AIC’s funds paid to purchase the\n\nproperty at the September 2000 tax sale and for property taxes.\n\n      Greensbrook asserted that AIC’s claims were barred by adverse possession.\n\nGreensbrook also brought a counterclaim against AIC for trespass to try title and an\n\naction to quiet title and remove a cloud, i.e., AIC’s Correction Deed.\n\n      The trial court ordered that AT&T deposit into the registry of the court the\n\ndisputed funds and all additional disputed amounts each month thereafter until a final\n\njudgment was signed. The trial court further ordered that the case continue on the\n\nmerits between AIC and Greensbrook to determine their respective rights to the\n\ndisputed funds and a determination of all claims by all parties.\n\n      AT&T then moved for a summary judgment on AIC’s breach-of-contract\n\nclaim, asserting that AIC was barred by limitations from recovering any Lease\n\npayments made prior to August 11, 2007, i.e., more than four years before AIC filed\n\nits counterclaim. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of AT&T on\n\nits limitations defense.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      The trial court denied Greensbrook’s and AIC’s motions for a summary\n\njudgment on the validity of AIC’s correction deed and title issues.\n\n      A week prior to trial, AT&T filed a “Rule 248 Motion Regarding Legal\n\nDetermination of the Validity of Claimants’ Deeds.” AT&T noted that Greensbrook\n\nhad demanded a jury trial and that Rule 248 required that the trial court determine\n\nall questions of law before the jury trial commenced. Greensbrook claimed title to\n\nthe property through its 1998 Special Warranty Deed, and AIC claimed title to the\n\nproperty through its 2005 Correction Deed. AT&T asserted that neither deed was\n\nambiguous, and it requested that the trial court rule on the “legal validity” of AIC’s\n\nand Greensbrook’s deeds, through which they each asserted an interest in the\n\ninterpleaded funds and the Lease, and strike the claim of any deed that “cannot\n\ntransfer an interest in real property.” AT&T asserted that “the scope of the trial may\n\nbe limited or the need for a trial may be eliminated in its entirety.” To its motion,\n\nAT&T attached Greensbrook’s deed, AIC’s Correction Deed, the original 2005 deed\n\nto Aldine ISD.\n\n      AIC responded, “The matters which may be addressed by Rule 248 are\n\nmatters such as motions in limine, the admission of uncontested evidence and the\n\nlike. The Court cannot rule on the validity of a deed that is not in evidence.”\n\n      At the hearing on AT&T’s “Rule 248 Motion,” AIC withdrew its opposition\n\nand asked the trial court to rule on the validity of its Correction Deed. AIC asserted\n\n                                          8\n\fthat “the deeds are before the Court as exhibits to AT&T’s motion.” The trial court\n\nthen considered the deeds and heard argument of the parties, as discussed below.\n\nThe trial court signed an “Order Construing the AIC Correction Deed Pursuant to\n\nRule 248,” in which it found that AIC’s Correction Deed “was subject to section\n\n5.029[4] of the Texas Property Code concerning Material Corrections and Correction\n\nInstruments” and did not substantially comply with the requirement that a correction\n\ninstrument be executed by each party to the recorded original instrument. The trial\n\ncourt held that AIC’s Correction Deed was invalid as a matter of law.\n\n      Subsequently, at the beginning of trial, Greensbrook waived its demand for a\n\njury trial, and the parties agreed to try the case to the court. Greensbrook non-suited\n\nits trespass-to-try-title claim and AIC informed the trial court that it “ha[d] not\n\nbrought a trespass-to-try-title claim.” The trial court denied AIC’s motion for leave\n\nto amend its pleadings to assert an equitable title claim.\n\n      The trial court then admitted into evidence, inter alia, a copy of the Lease and\n\ncopies of the deeds, discussed above, from each party and heard argument. The trial\n\ncourt ruled that AIC’s declaratory judgment claim was resolved by its finding that\n\nAIC’s Correction Deed was invalid as a matter of law, that “Greensbrook has\n\nsuperior title to AIC,” and that AT&T did not breach a contract with AIC. At a\n\n\n\n\n4\n      See TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 5.029 (West 2014)\n                                           9\n\fsubsequent hearing, counsel for Greensbrook testified regarding its attorney’s fees\n\nas to AIC’s declaratory judgment claim.\n\n      The trial court, in its final judgment, after noting that it had previously found\n\nthat AIC’s Correction Deed was invalid, declared that Greensbrook is the “legal\n\nowner” of the property and ordered that AIC’s Correction Deed not cloud\n\nGreensbrook’s title. With respect to AIC’s breach-of-contract claim, the trial court\n\nheld that AIC take nothing. With respect to AIC’s claim for unjust enrichment, the\n\ntrial court awarded AIC, out of the court registry, damages in the amount of\n\n$39,795.82. The trial court awarded the balance of the funds in the registry to\n\nGreensbrook. The trial court further awarded Greensbrook attorney’s fees in the\n\namount of $65,000.00 through trial, $15,000.00 through appeal, $7,500.00 through\n\na petition to the supreme court, and $10,000.00 for briefing and argument in the\n\nsupreme court.5\n\n                          Validity of the Correction Deed\n\n      In its sixth issue, AIC argues that the trial court erred by determining the\n\nvalidity of its deed, which it characterizes as a “contested factual issue,” at a\n\nproceeding under Rule of Civil Procedure 248. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 248. In its third\n\nissue, AIC asserts that the trial court erred by holding that its Correction Deed is\n\n\n\n5\n      The trial court did not, despite request by AIC, file findings of fact and conclusions\n      of law.

In its second issue, AIC argues that the trial court erred by “invalidating a\n\ndeed to Aldine ISD.”\n\n      1.     Rule 248 Proceeding\n\n      AIC asserts that “immediately prior to the scheduled jury trial, AT&T filed a\n\nRule 248 motion on a single issue—the validity of AIC’s correction deed.” AIC\n\nasserts that the trial court was “misdirected” to consider the validity of AIC’s\n\nCorrection Deed before considering the “entire chain of title.”\n\n      A trial court has inherent power to control the resolution of cases on its docket\n\nand is granted wide discretion to conduct trial as it deems appropriate.

AT&T\n\nrequested that the trial court rule on the “legal validity” of AIC’s and Greensbrook’s\n\n                                         11\n\fdeeds and strike the claim of any deed that “cannot transfer an interest in real\n\nproperty.” AT&T asserted that neither deed was ambiguous and, with respect to\n\nAIC’s Correction Deed, the issue presented was whether it complied with the\n\nrequirements under the Texas Property Code, discussed below, that a correction\n\ninstrument be executed by each party to the recorded original instrument. AT&T\n\nnoted that both AIC and Greensbrook had each previously, through respective\n\nmotions for summary judgment, asserted that it was entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law on its claim of title to the property and that there existed no genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact.\n\n      The record of the hearing on AT&T’s “Rule 248 Motion” reflects that AIC\n\nsimilarly requested that the trial court determine the validity of its deed as a matter\n\nof law:\n\n      [AT&T]:              . . . . The Court has heard summary judgment\n                           motions from both of the parties and the most recent\n                           of which was AIC’s motion regarding the correction\n                           deed. During that hearing the Court made some\n                           comments about whether or not that correction deed\n                           met the statute for correction deeds and whether it\n                           contained the signatures it needed . . . .\n      THE COURT:           . . . . This was AIC’s[?]\n      [AT&T]:              Yes, Your Honor. And so in light of the fact that\n                           we are set for trial and because of the scope of the\n                           trial really hinges on whether or not AIC’s\n                           deed . . . is a valid deed—\n      THE COURT:           Well, it’s either—it’s either valid or not, right?\n\n\n                                          12\n\f[AT&T]:      Exactly right. And so we wanted to bring that to the\n             Court’s attention. AT&T doesn’t take a position on\n             whether or not it’s valid, . . . but we want the Court\n             to rule on it before the trial begins.\n[AIC]:       . . . . And the idea of having a ruling on the validity\n             of the deeds in question I think would be helpful for\n             the parties in trying the case and could abbreviate\n             the trial. What I’m concerned about is the state of\n             the record on which the Court’s ruling would be\n             based should it find, for example, AIC’s deed to be\n             either valid or invalid.\n             We have presented many number of exhibits in our\n             motion for summary judgment in order to establish\n             through the chain of title that the constable’s deed\n             was for the property on which the AT&T tower is\n             situated so that we would have a clear record and\n             show that our deed was—involved that property.\n             That’s the biggest thing that I care about on a ruling\n             on the validity or invalidity is to make sure that the\n             record is clear that that deed pertains to the realty\n             upon which AT&T’s cell tower is situated and that\n             is made the subject of the lease into which AT&T\n             had entered. That’s all I care about, Judge.\nTHE COURT:   But I’m not sure I quite understand what you’re\n             saying. If the Court is going to make a legal\n             determination regarding the validity of a specific\n             deed, like a corrected deed, I’m looking—and\n             without making any other ancillary rulings, chain of\n             title or who owns the property, that kind of thing,\n             but I—if you give me the deed, apply whatever\n             sections of the property code I need to apply, I can\n             tell you right then and there it’s material, not\n             material, it complies, doesn’t comply and it’s a good\n             deed, bad deed, right?\n[AIC]:       I think so.\n....\n\n\n\n                            13\n\f                          . . . . And it doesn’t really matter what the state of\n                          the record is on the predicate transactions. It is just\n                          is that deed a valid deed or invalid deed.\n      THE COURT:          Right and I’m not—\n      [AIC]:              And thinking through that with your assistance,\n                          Judge, I think that makes sense, and I’m okay with\n                          that.\n      ....\n                          I agree that the Court can rule on whether or not the\n                          deed is a valid or invalid deed as a matter of law. I\n                          think the deeds are before the Court as exhibits to\n                          AT&T’s motion, and I’ll withdraw the opposition\n                          that AIC had to that motion and ask that the Court\n                          rule on the validity or invalidity of the deeds that are\n                          attached to AT&T’s motion.\n\n      Thus, the record shows that, not only did AIC not object to the trial court\n\nmaking a ruling on the issue of the validity of its deed, but AIC affirmatively\n\nrequested a ruling from the trial court on the issue. Accordingly, the issue is waived.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a) (requiring that complaints be made in trial court as\n\nprerequisite for appellate review); see also Tittizer v.

See id. § 5.028(a)(2)(A). At\n\nissue in this case, however, is not a correction to the spelling of a party’s name, but\n\na substitution of an entirely different party as grantee.

I think we’re all under the assumption that a new\n                           named grantee, completely new person, would be a\n                           5.029 correction instrument with the material\n                           correction.\n      [AIC]:               Correct.\n\n                                          20\n\f      ....\n      THE COURT:          Okay. So everybody is in agreement that this is a\n                          5.029; that is, it’s a material correction because\n                          we’re changing who the grantee is?\n      [AIC]:              Yes, sir.\n\n      Further, AIC did not dispute that section 5.029 requires that an instrument\n\nmaking a material correction be “executed by each party to the recorded original\n\ninstrument of conveyance the correction instrument is executed to correct or, if\n\napplicable, a party’s heirs, successors, or assigns.”       TEX. PROP. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 5.029(b)(1).\n\n      AIC argued in the trial court, as it does so on appeal, that, notwithstanding the\n\nlack of a signature by Aldine ISD on the Correction Deed, substantial compliance\n\nwith section 5.029 is sufficient. At the hearing, the following discussion took place:\n\n      THE COURT:          Okay. And so—under 5.029(b) it would have\n                          needed to have been recorded by—it would need to\n                          have been executed by Hickman and Aldine ISD;\n                          right?\n      [Greensbrook]:      That’s correct, Judge.\n      [AIC]:              Except that the Court was referred to a subsequent\n                          section in the Property Code, the number of which\n                          escapes me, where it recognizes that correction\n                          deeds that were recorded before the effective date\n                          of the statute have to, quote, substantially comply\n                          with the requirements of the material change\n                          provision.

Otherwise someone\n                         could sell a piece of property, go in, they get the\n                         property, and then two months later say, okay, file\n                         a correction deed and then give it to somebody else\n                         and just keep doing that over and over and it would\n                         be okay under the law because they’re just\n                         correction deeds.\n      [AIC]:             And that’s what the Court pointed out at the hearing\n                         on the motion for summary judgment. And I\n                         understand the Court’s feelings about it.

I wanted to make sure I ran through the traps\n                         and I wasn’t thinking about some other section in it\n                         or some other issue.\n      [AIC]:             You’re spot on on what this is all about.\n\n      Property Code section 5.031 states that\n\n       A correction instrument recorded before September 1, 2011, that\n      substantially complies with Section 5.028 or 5.029 and that purports to\n      correct a recorded original instrument of conveyance is effective to the\n      same extent as provided by Section 5.030 unless a court of competent\n      jurisdiction renders a final judgment determining that the correction\n      instrument does not substantially comply with Section 5.028 or 5.029.\n\nTEX.

See Tanya L. McCabe\n\nTrust, 531 S.W.3d at 799 (holding correction instruments that did not comply with\n\nsection 5.029 to be invalid). We hold that the trial court did not err in holding that\n\nAIC’s Correction Deed is invalid.\n\n      With respect to AIC’s assertion that the trial court lacked “jurisdiction to\n\ndeclare Aldine ISD’s judgment or deed void,” nothing in the trial court’s judgment\n\ndeclares void any deed held by Aldine ISD. As AIC notes in its brief, Aldine ISD is\n\n                                         23\n\fnot a party to this appeal.

To determine whether an unpleaded issue\n\nwas tried by consent, we examine the record not for evidence of the issue, but rather\n\nfor evidence of trial of the issue. See Pickelner v.

See id.\n\n      Because the record does not reflect that Greensbrook requested affirmative\n\nrelief on its adverse possession claim, we hold that the trial court erred in declaring\n\nGreensbrook the legal owner of the property through adverse possession.\n\n      We sustain AIC’s first issue.\n\n      Because we have sustained the error in the ruling favoring Greensbrook, we\n\nalso sustain AIC’s fifth issue, in which it argues that the trial court erred in awarding\n\nGreensbrook attorney’s fees because such fees are barred in a trespass-to-try-title\n\naction. The recovery of attorney’s fees in trespass-to-try-title actions is barred\n                                           29\n\fbecause, with a limited exception for boundary disputes between adjoining\n\nproperties, Property Code chapter 22 does not provide for them.
