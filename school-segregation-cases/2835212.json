This appeal presents the final chapter in the court-\nordered desegregation of the Shelby County, Tennessee, public school system, a process\nwhich began forty-five years ago. In 1963, plaintiff public school students1 filed this\nclass action against defendant Shelby County Board of Education (“Board”) alleging\nunconstitutional racial segregation in the Shelby County schools. In the ensuing period,\nthe district court issued numerous orders requiring the elimination of all vestiges of\nstate-imposed public school segregation in accordance with the mandate of Brown v. Bd.\nof Educ. of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). A court-approved desegregation plan was\nimplemented and in August 2006, after decades of court supervision, the parties moved\njointly to dissolve all outstanding orders, declare the school district a unitary school\nsystem, and terminate the litigation. The United States, which has participated as an\nintervenor since 1966, supported the motion.2\n\n         Despite the parties’ universal agreement that the goals of the desegregation plan\nhave been satisfactorily fulfilled and that educational parity has been attained, the district\ncourt disagreed that the constitutional requirements for unitary status have been met in\nall relevant respects. Consequently, although the court granted the joint motion in regard\nto facilities, transportation, and staffing, it denied the motion as it pertained to the areas\nof student assignment, faculty integration, and extracurricular activities. The district\ncourt established new “racial ratios” for the racial composition of students and faculty\n\n\n\n\n         1\n         At oral argument, counsel asserted that throughout this litigation plaintiffs have been represented\nby the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n         2\n           In its response to the joint motion, the United States advised the district court that “[t]he United\nStates has not received any complaints concerning the district’s compliance with its desegregation\nobligations.” Further, after the conclusion of two “fairness hearings,” see generally UAW v. Gen. Motors\nCorp., 497 F.3d 615, 635 (6th Cir. 2007), the United States represented: “It would appear on whole that\nthe defendant has complied in good faith with the deseg[regation] orders and . . . under applicable legal\nprinciples they are entitled to a dismissal.”\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363               Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.                        Page 3\n\n\nwhich it expected to be met no later than October 2012. The court anticipated that if its\nnew orders were followed, it would end its school supervision by October 2015.3\n\n         Defendant Shelby County Schools now appeals the portion of the district court\norder denying the joint motion for unitary status. The intervenor United States appeals\nthe remedy ordered by the district court for faculty integration.4\n\n         For the reasons stated below, we hold that the district court abused its discretion\nby denying the parties’ joint motion for unitary status regarding student assignment,\nfaculty integration, and extracurricular activities. Accordingly, we reverse, in part, the\norder of the district court and remand with instructions to grant in full the parties’ joint\nmotion for declaration of unitary status, dissolve all outstanding orders and injunctions\nas to the Board and its members, and dismiss this action as to all parties and claims.\n\n                                                       I.\n\n         In general, “‘[t]he acceptance of a settlement in a class action suit is discretionary\nwith the court and will be overturned only by a showing of abuse of discretion.’” Clark\nEquip. Co. v. Int’l Union, Allied Indus. Workers of Am., AFL-CIO, 803 F.2d 878, 880\n(6th Cir. 1986) (quoting Laskey v. UAW, 638 F.2d 954, 957 (6th Cir. 1981)). See also\nFidel v. Farley, 534 F.3d 508, 513 (6th Cir. 2008) (“We review a district court’s\napproval of a settlement as fair, adequate, and reasonable for abuse of discretion.”)\n(citation omitted).\n\n         In the specific setting of a school desegregation class action, “[w]here the relief\nsought in the district court is the dissolution of a[] [desegregation decree], the order of\nthe district court is subject to a mixed standard of review.” Manning ex rel. Manning v.\nSchool Bd. of Hillsborough County, 244 F.3d 927, 940 (11th Cir. 2001). We review the\ndistrict court’s partial denial of the parties’ joint motion to dissolve the desegregation\ndecree for an abuse of discretion. Id. (citation omitted); see also Little Rock Sch. Dist.\n\n         3\n           On April 24, 2008, a different panel of this court granted defendant’s motion to stay the order\nof the district court pending our resolution of the merits of this appeal.\n         4\n             Plaintiffs moved unsuccessfully to file a late brief in support of the Board’s appeal.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.             Page 4\n\n\nv. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 921 F.2d 1371, 1391 (8th Cir. 1990)\n(reviewing district court’s rejection of settlement plan in school desegregation case for\nabuse of discretion); Armstrong v. Bd. of School Directors of City of Milwaukee, 616\nF.2d 305, 319 (7th Cir. 1980), overruled in part on other grounds by Felzen v. Andreas,\n134 F.3d 873 (7th Cir. 1998) (holding that the abuse of discretion standard “is not\nreserved only for purely economic [class action] litigation” and thus “will govern our\nreview of the district court’s approval of the [desegregation] settlement proposal.”).\n\n       The district court’s application of the law is subject to de novo review, while the\ncourt’s factual findings, including its determination that a school district has not\nachieved unitary status, fall under the clearly erroneous standard of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 52(a). Manning, 244 F.3d at 940 (citations omitted); Holton v. City of\nThomasville School Dist., 425 F.3d 1325, 1336 (11th Cir. 2005) (citations omitted).\n“Courts of appeals view the facts in the light most favorable to the settlement.”\nArmstrong, 616 F.2d at 315 (citation omitted).\n\n                                            II.\n\n       The procedural history of this class action, which is set forth in detail in the\ndistrict court’s order addressing the parties’ joint motion for a declaration of unitary\nstatus, reflects four decades of slow but steady progress in the removal of all vestiges of\nstate-imposed public school segregation. The present-day posture of the case finds the\nparties at a new crossroads – facing the rare and atypical situation in which a district\ncourt has rejected, in part, a reasonable and good-faith joint motion by plaintiffs and\ndefendant to declare a school system unitary. See Wendy Parker, The Decline of\nJudicial Decisionmaking: School Desegregation and District Court Judges, 81 N.C. L.\nREV. 1623, 1636-37 nn.76-80 (2003) (symposium) (collecting cases in which joint\nmotions for unitary status were approved).\n\n       In applying the abuse-of-discretion review standard to these uncommon\ncircumstances, we acknowledge as a preliminary matter that a district court’s\n“familiarity with the litigants and the litigation [in a long-standing desegregation suit]\nis a valuable asset which should not lightly be discarded.” Armstrong, 616 F.2d at 319.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.               Page 5\n\n\nNonetheless, it is also well-established that “[p]ublic policy strongly favors settlement\nof disputes without litigation . . . . Settlement agreements should therefore be upheld\nwhenever equitable and policy considerations so permit.” Ford Motor Co. v. Mustangs\nUnlimited, Inc., 487 F.3d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting Aro Corp. v. Allied Witan\nCo., 531 F.2d 1368, 1372 (6th Cir. 1976)). See also Gen. Motors Corp., 497 F.3d at 632\n(noting “the federal policy favoring settlement of class actions”) (citation omitted). This\npolicy applies equally to desegregation cases. See Little Rock Sch. Dist., 921 F.2d at\n1388 (noting that “[a] strong public policy favors agreements, and courts should\napproach them with a presumption in their favor” in ordering the district court to\napprove a desegregation settlement plan.).\n\n        The voluntary settlement of school desegregation controversies is to be\nencouraged, even though such litigation implicates the important civil rights of the\nplaintiff class:\n\n        [D]espite the importance of the substantive rights of the class members,\n        settlement is an appropriate method of arriving at a school desegregation\n        remedy. While courts should be extremely sensitive to the possibilities\n        for abuse where a compromise of the civil rights of a class is proposed,\n        a blanket prohibition of compromise could result, in many cases, in\n        abandonment of the substantial benefits which can result from voluntary\n        resolution of litigation, without a commensurate increase in the\n        protection accorded the civil rights of the class. Indeed, it appears that\n        school desegregation is one of the areas in which voluntary resolution is\n        preferable to full litigation because the spirit of cooperation inherent in\n        good faith settlement is essential to the true long-range success of any\n        desegregation remedy. A remedial decree reached through agreement\n        between the parties may, because of the community cooperation it\n        inspires, more effectively implement the constitutional guarantee of equal\n        protection than a seemingly more stringent court-ordered remedy which\n        the community views as imposed upon it from the outside.\nArmstrong, 616 F.2d at 317-18 (internal citations omitted).\n\n        In Armstrong, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals applied the abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard in affirming the district court’s approval of a settlement agreement\nterminating a public school desegregation class action. We find its extensive analysis\nto be instructive. The Armstrong court held correctly that even “a school desegregation\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363          Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.              Page 6\n\n\nplan devised through voluntary means . . . must attain a certain minimum level of\nconstitutional compliance.” Id. at 319 (citing Liddell v. Caldwell, 546 F.2d 768 (8th Cir.\n1976)). Consequently, when a proposed settlement is on the table,\n\n       [a] federal court cannot permit an agreement between counsel for the\n       defendants and counsel for the plaintiff class seriously to undercut the\n       constitutional policy requiring desegregation of our nation’s schools; this\n       is true even where the class members themselves do not oppose a\n       particular settlement. At the same time, however, the court cannot\n       disregard the desire of the litigants amicably to settle their litigation nor\n       can it ignore the substantial benefits which can accrue to both the class\n       members and the general public from a fair and adequate settlement of\n       a school desegregation controversy.\nArmstrong, 616 F.2d at 319.\n\n       Thus, the district court must delicately balance these competing interests before\ndeciding whether the proposed settlement is fair. The bottom line, as the Armstrong\ncourt explained, is that\n\n       no settlement [should] be approved which either initiates or authorizes\n       the continuation of clearly illegal conduct. A school desegregation\n       settlement which authorizes clearly unconstitutional behavior is, on its\n       face, neither fair, reasonable nor adequate as required by the class action\n       standard. In applying this principle, however, the court must not decide\n       unsettled legal questions; any illegality or unconstitutionality must\n       appear as a legal certainty on the face of the agreement before a\n       settlement can be rejected on this basis.\nId. at 319-20 (internal citations omitted).\n\n       Significantly, in assessing whether the settlement is fair, equitable, and\nreasonable, “the district court must not forget that it is reviewing a settlement proposal\nrather than ordering a remedy in a litigated case.” Id. at 314-15. Accordingly,\n“[b]ecause settlement of a class action, like settlement of any litigation, is basically a\nbargained for exchange between the litigants, the judiciary’s role is properly limited to\nthe minimum necessary to protect the interests of the class and the public. Judges\nshould not substitute their own judgment as to optimal settlement terms for the judgment\nof the litigants and their counsel.” Id. at 315 (emphasis added).\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.               Page 7\n\n\n        The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals echoed these sentiments in Little Rock Sch.\nDist., a case in which it reversed a district court’s rejection of a joint motion to settle the\nLittle Rock, Arkansas, school desegregation case:\n\n        The most important fact about the present appeals is that they arise out\n        of settlements agreed to by all parties in the District Court. We believe\n        the District Court erred by failing to give sufficient weight to that fact.\n        It treated the case almost as if it were a fully contested matter . . . . We\n        respectfully disagree with this approach. The law strongly favors\n        settlements. Courts should hospitably receive them. This may be\n        especially true in the present context – a protracted, highly divisive . . .\n        litigation, any lasting solution to which necessarily depends on the good\n        faith and cooperation of all the parties, especially the defendants. As a\n        practical matter, a remedy that everyone agrees to is a lot more likely to\n        succeed than one to which the defendants must be dragged kicking and\n        screaming.\n        This does not mean that a court must automatically approve anything the\n        parties set before it . . . . [T]his is a class action, and courts are not\n        obliged (indeed, they are not permitted) to approve settlements that are\n        unfair to class members, or negotiated by inadequate class\n        representatives.\n                                            ***\n        We are bound to respect this factual agreement by the parties. There is\n        no evidence in this record to contradict it, and we must believe that\n        counsel for the [] intervenors are the best defenders and guardians of the\n        interests of their own clients. This is, after all, no ordinary litigation.\n        The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, its lawyers and its\n        predecessors, have vigorously prosecuted this case and its ancestors for\n        more than 30 years. Absent an extremely good reason – and we have\n        been given none – we are reluctant to disregard their judgment as to\n        what is best for their own clients.\nLittle Rock Sch. Dist., 921 F.2d at 1383, 1386 (emphasis added).\n\n        We, too, endorse this approach, which “take[s] into account . . . the special\nconcerns implicit in [civil rights] class action settlements while still preserving the\nessential character of settlement of a lawsuit.” Armstrong, 616 F.2d at 315. Thus, while\nthe district court should not give “rubber stamp approval” in lieu of independent review\nto the parties’ joint unitary status motion, id., it must afford considerable weight to the\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.              Page 8\n\n\njoint motion when it is reasonable, filed in good faith, and demonstrates that the\nconstitutional mandate requiring desegregation has been satisfied.\n\n                                            III.\n\n        In evaluating the district court’s partial rejection of the parties’ joint motion for\nunitary status, it is important that we briefly highlight the legal precedent that forms the\nbackdrop of this prolonged desegregation litigation.\n\n        The duty and responsibility of a school district once segregated by law\n        is to take all steps necessary to eliminate the vestiges of the\n        unconstitutional de jure system. This is required in order to ensure that\n        the principal wrong of the de jure system, the injuries and stigma\n        inflicted upon the race disfavored by the violation, is no longer present.\n        This was the rationale and the objective of Brown I [v. Bd. of Educ., 347\n        U.S. 483 (1954)] and Brown II [v. Bd. of Educ., 349 U.S. 294 (1955)].\nFreeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 485 (1992).\n\n        The Supreme Court has held that the “transition to a unitary, nonracial system\nof public education was and is the ultimate end” of its desegregation jurisprudence.\nGreen v. County Sch. Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 436 (1968) (citing Brown\nI, 349 U.S. at 299-301). Although “the term ‘unitary’ is not a precise concept,”\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 487, the Supreme Court identified certain features of the school\nsystem that must be freed from racial discrimination before the desegregation process\nwill be deemed successful and local control will be allowed to resume: student\nassignment, faculty assignment, staff assignment, facilities and resources, transportation,\nand extracurricular activities. Green, 391 U.S. at 435.\n\n        The Court has since provided guidance for determining whether a school district\nhas met its obligation under a desegregation decree. “The ultimate inquiry is whether\nthe [constitutional violator] ha[s] complied in good faith with the desegregation decree\nsince it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been\neliminated to the extent practicable.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 89 (1995)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court has described a number of\nfactors to consider, including:\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.              Page 9\n\n\n        whether there has been full and satisfactory compliance with the decree\n        in those aspects of the system where supervision is to be withdrawn;\n        whether retention of judicial control is necessary or practicable to\n        achieve compliance with the decree in other facets of the school system;\n        and whether the school district has demonstrated, to the public and to the\n        parents and students of the once disfavored race, its good-faith\n        commitment to the whole of the court’s decree and to those provisions\n        of the law and the Constitution that were the predicate for judicial\n        intervention in the first instance.\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 491.\n\n        Finally, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the extreme remedy of federal\njudicial supervision of local school systems was intended to be a temporary act limited\nto curing the effects of prior discrimination. “Returning schools to the control of local\nauthorities at the earliest practicable date is essential to restore their true accountability\nin our governmental system.” Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490. Thus,\n\n        [s]uch decrees, unlike the one in [United States v.] Swift [& Co., 286 U.S.\n        106, 119 (1932)], are not intended to operate in perpetuity. Local control\n        over the education of children allows citizens to participate in\n        decisionmaking, and allows innovation so that school programs can fit\n        local needs. Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 742 (1974) (Milliken I);\n        San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 50 (1973). The\n        legal justification for displacement of local authority by an injunctive\n        decree in a school desegregation case is a violation of the Constitution by\n        the local authorities. Dissolving a desegregation decree after the local\n        authorities have operated in compliance with it for a reasonable period\n        of time properly recognizes that “necessary concern for the important\n        values of local control of public school systems dictates that a federal\n        court’s regulatory control of such systems not extend beyond the time\n        required to remedy the effects of past intentional discrimination.\nBd. of Educ. of Oklahoma City v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 248 (1990) (citations omitted).\n\n                                             IV.\n\n        In the present case, the district court denied unitary status in the areas of student\nassignment, faculty integration, and extracurricular activities. As we explain below, the\ndistrict court abused its discretion by not affording sufficient weight to the parties’ joint\nmotion and its factual basis.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363       Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 10\n\n\n                                A. Student Assignment\n\n       On the issue of student assignment, the district court found that the parties failed\nto satisfy an evidentiary burden imposed by the court:\n\n       Applying these principles to the case at hand, the Court finds that the\n       County is not presently in compliance with its constitutional obligations\n       with regard to student assignment. As explained supra, the racial\n       composition of the majority of the County schools is substantially\n       disproportionate to that of the district as a whole. The Board has made\n       no showing that racial balance is infeasible either generally or with\n       regard to certain schools. Furthermore, the record does not indicate that\n       the County has at any time accomplished its objectives; in fact, after\n       making considerable progress towards desegregation, the County has\n       seemingly drifted from any serious focus on desegregation.\n       While demographic factors, including those caused by annexation of\n       portions of the County by the City of Memphis, have clearly played a\n       part in creating the present racial composition of the County schools, the\n       County has not met its burden of showing that it would have achieved its\n       goal had it not been for these factors. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court\n       has articulated, the Board’s decisions with regard to school construction\n       and zoning have necessarily played an influential role in those\n       demographic shifts. Consequently, the Court must assume that the\n       remaining significant disparity in racial composition among the schools\n       is a product of past de jure segregation.\n(Footnote omitted; emphasis added.)\n\n       During the forty-five years of this litigation, the racial composition of the\nstudents attending the Shelby County Schools has fluctuated widely. Although the\nschool district’s overall student population and minority enrollment have grown rapidly,\nthe percentage of African-American students in the Shelby County Schools has varied\nsignificantly: 28 percent in 1969; 30 percent in 1971; 15 percent in 1984; 22 percent in\n2001; 32 percent in 2005; and 34 percent in 2007. The district court attributed much of\nthe racial ratio changes to annexations by the City of Memphis: “In 1984, the percentage\nof black students systemwide had dropped precipitously, apparently largely due to\nannexation into the City of Memphis of portions of the County . . . .” Further, at the\ndistrict court’s January 26, 2007, hearing, Assistant Board Superintendent Maura Black\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363              Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.                       Page 11\n\n\nSullivan testified that if the planned City of Memphis annexations are implemented,\nShelby County Schools’ African-American student ratio will decrease to 7.68 percent.\n\n         It is undisputed that political and social decisions beyond defendant Board’s\ncontrol have affected and continue to impact the racial ratio of the Shelby County\nstudents. These influences are not causally related to defendant’s violation of the\nConstitution and fall outside of the scope of the court’s equitable powers to restore the\nvictims of discrimination to the position they would have occupied absent the violation.\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402\nU.S. 1 (1971):\n\n         Neither school authorities nor district courts are constitutionally required\n         to make year-by-year adjustments of the racial compositions of student\n         bodies once the affirmative duty to desegregate has been accomplished\n         and racial discrimination through official action is eliminated from the\n         system . . . . [Therefore,] in the absence of a showing that either the\n         school authorities or some other agency of the State has deliberately\n         attempted to fix or alter demographic patterns to affect the racial\n         composition of the schools, further intervention by a district court should\n         not be necessary.\nId. at 31-32. As we further explained in Reed v. Rhodes, 179 F.3d 453 (6th Cir. 1999):\n\n         That there was racial imbalance in student attendance zones was not\n         tantamount to a showing that the school district was in noncompliance\n         with the decree or with its duties under the law. Racial balance is not to\n         be achieved for its own sake. It is to be pursued when racial imbalance\n         has been caused by a constitutional violation. Once the racial imbalance\n         due to the de jure violation has been remedied, the school district is\n         under no duty to remedy imbalance that is caused by demographic\n         factors.\nId. at 466 (quoting Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494) (emphasis added).5\n\n         In granting unitary status in three of six areas, the district court “recognize[d] the\ngreat progress the Board has made in desegregating its schools.” Further, the court\n\n         5\n           In Reed, we affirmed the district court’s order holding that the Cleveland City School District\nwas entitled to a declaration of unitary status with respect to pupil assignments, where the district’s record\nof compliance stood as an unequivocal manifestation of good faith and “[t]he demographics of recent years\nhave reflected rapid population shifts within the city that were not caused by or attributable to the\nCleveland School District.” Reed, 179 F.3d at 467 (citation omitted).\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363          Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.          Page 12\n\n\nfound “no evidence that there has been racial discrimination by the County in the areas\nof facilities, transportation or staffing during the last few decades of this case.”\nAlthough the district judge acknowledged at a status conference that de jure racial\ndiscrimination no longer exists in the school district, she nonetheless continued federal\ncourt supervision of student assignment because, in her opinion, the racial ratio in\nindividual schools was “uneven.” The district judge cited the school district’s new state-\nof-the-art Southwind High School as an example of such unevenness; Southwind was\nexpected to open in the fall of 2007 with an African-American student population of\napproximately 88 percent.\n\n          In determining whether the present racial “unevenness” is properly subject to the\ncourt’s equitable remedies, we must decide if the current conditions are vestiges of the\nprior unconstitutional de jure system or the products of other actions or conditions.\nReed, 179 F.3d at 466. Following oral argument and our review of the record and briefs,\nwe conclude that the lower court clearly erred in finding the former, rather than the\nlatter.\n\n          In the past decades, the vestiges of the racially segregated Shelby School system\nhave been dismantled. A new “unitary, nonracial system of public education,” Green,\n391 U.S. at 436, has risen in its place for which the parties are justifiably proud. The\nrecord reveals that the racial “unevenness” that currently exists in individual schools is\nnot the product of defendant’s forty-five- year-old constitutional violation. Rather, with\nthe passage of time and court intervention, other dynamics have now shaped the district\ninto its current form. The annexations by the City of Memphis, along with voluntary\nhousing choices made by the public, have drastically altered the racial composition of\nthe school district. In addition, school construction and student boundaries (including\nthe new Southwind High School) approved by the district court over the past few\ndecades have affected the present racial unevenness. Although the district court now\nfaults itself for “rubber-stamp[ing]” school construction and zoning requests (JA 116),\nits role in managing and shaping the school district cannot be ignored.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.              Page 13\n\n\n        Finally, the Supreme Court requires that we consider “whether the school district\nhas demonstrated, to the public and to the parents and students of the once disfavored\nrace, its good-faith commitment to the whole of the court’s decree and to those\nprovisions of the law and the Constitution that were the predicate for judicial\nintervention in the first instance.” Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491.\n\n        On this issue, we are greatly influenced by the position of plaintiffs. The\nplaintiffs fought this battle to desegregate the Shelby County Schools. They are the\nstudents, and now parents or grandparents, who suffered from the constitutional\nviolation. In their view, the battle has been won. They now ask that we declare the\nschool district to be a unitary, nonracial system of public education. We afford great\nweight to the appraisal of the most interested parties to this litigation, particularly where\nthe record illustrates defendant’s compliance with the desegregation order through the\ncreation of remedial programs targeting racial inequities and the construction of state-of-\nthe-art facilities. See Reed, 179 F.3d at 466-67 (citing the school district’s initiatives\n“designed to develop self-esteem and enhance the academic potential of all students\nregardless of race” and other corrective measures taken in African American schools “to\ninvolve parents and offset negative socioeconomic factors” as evidence of the district’s\ngood-faith efforts to desegregate the school system).            Under the circumstances,\ndefendant has satisfactorily complied with the student assignment portion of the\ndesegregation decree and therefore is entitled to a declaration of unitary status with\nrespect to this component.\n\n                                  B. Faculty Integration\n\n        For the reasons previously stated, and those recited below, we also hold that the\ndistrict court clearly erred in rejecting unitary status as it pertains to faculty integration.\n\n        In this regard, the district court found that defendant Board was likewise “not in\nfull compliance” with the law because the African-American teacher ratio varied in\nindividual schools from five percent to thirty percent. In “hindsight,” the court\nacknowledged that its prior “focus on this aspect was ill-conceived.” Although noting\nthat “a school desegregation plan is not an affirmative action program for teachers,” the\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 14\n\n\ncourt reversed its previous approach by directing that the racial ratio of the faculty match\nthe racial composition of the student population as a whole:\n\n        On this ground, the Court finds that, rather than tying the racial\n        composition of a school’s faculty to that of the population of teachers in\n        the system as [a] whole, it should be linked instead to the racial\n        composition of the student population. Accordingly, the Court finds it\n        necessary to depart from its prior directives and concludes that the\n        County’s constitutional obligations require the achievement of a racial\n        balance reflective of the systemwide student population, within a margin\n        of error to be enumerated below and subject to mitigating circumstances\n        and a feasibility requirement, as developed supra.\n(Footnote omitted; first emphasis in original, second emphasis added.)\n\n        The intervenor United States appeals this remedy arguing that it is unprecedented\nand would result in a “bizarre” and “racially discriminatory hiring and firing” of teachers\nto keep pace with the ever-changing racial dynamics of the student population.\n\n        At the hearing of January 26, 2007, Assistant Superintendent of Human\nResources Lois Williams, who is African-American, testified about the Board’s\nextensive efforts to recruit minority teachers. Ms. Williams testified that under the\nsupervision of minority recruiter Eddy Jones, who is also African-American, the Board,\nduring 2005-2006, visited over fifty-five colleges and universities, including “13\nhistorically black colleges and universities in an effort to recruit minority candidates for\nteaching positions in the Shelby County Schools.”\n\n        When asked if her decision-making would change if the case were dismissed, Ms.\nWilliams responded:\n\n        Q.      [Mr. Winchester] Okay. And you understand that we’re asking\n                the court to dismiss the Robinson case and – and be free from\n                judicial court scrutiny of our recruiting and hiring practices:\n        A.      [Ms. Williams] I do understand that, sir.\n        Q.      And if that occurs do – do you have thoughts or opinions as to\n                whether any of the efforts that are currently undertaken by the\n                school – by the school board to recruit, hire, and retain minority\n                faculty and administrators would change in any way whatsoever?\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363              Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.                        Page 15\n\n\n         A.        I don’t see that it would change.\n                   The superintendent, when Dr. Webb mentioned that he came to\n                   the Shelby County schools, he held a meeting with human\n                   resources and he asked if that department was equipped to\n                   recruit, retain and maintain high quality employees.\n                   He asked about the minority recruitment effort which he was well\n                   aware of the court order.\n                   The superintendent has empowered me to make decisions based\n                   upon what’s best for the students in Shelby County schools, and\n                   we recognize that our schools need to be reflective of the\n                   communities that they live in.\n                   The superintendent has also empowered me to make decisions\n                   based on the staffing within our schools.\n                   And so, as we look to recruit, retain, train and maintain highly\n                   qualified teaching staff, we certainly have an emphasis on being\n                   inclusive and making certain that our school district is reflective\n                   of our student population, the community and the world that we\n                   live in to prepare students.\n         Without citation to the record, the district court found that the defendant Board\nwas “not in full compliance with its obligations under the law.” We respectfully\ndisagree.\n\n         In striking down a similar student-based racial hiring plan in Oliver v.\nKalamazoo Bd. of Educ., 706 F.2d 757 (6th Cir. 1983), we explained that “students\n. . . do not have a constitutional right to attend a school with a teaching staff of any\nparticular racial composition. Rather, with respect to the teaching staff, all that the\nstudents are entitled to is the ‘sustained good faith effort to recruit minority faculty\nmembers so as to remedy the effects of any past discriminatory practices.’” Id. at 762\n(quoting Fort Bend Indep. Sch. Dist. v. City of Stafford, 651 F.2d 1133, 1140 (5th Cir.\n1981)).6 Instead, the court’s orders should require that “the faculty of each school reflect\nthe systemwide racial ratio of faculty members. . . .” United States v. DeSoto Parish\n\n\n         6\n           In Fort Bend Indep. Sch. Dist., the court held that “a formerly segregated school system need\nnot employ a faculty having a racial composition substantially equivalent to that of its student body in\norder effectively to desegregate its schools and attain unitary status” and concluded that “[t]he district court\nerred in imposing such a requirement.” 651 F.2d at 1138.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 16\n\n\nSch. Bd., 574 F.2d 804, 816 (5th Cir. 1978); United States v. Montgomery County Bd.\nof Educ., 395 U.S. 225, 232 (1969).\n\n        Here, as the United States rightly argues, imposition of the district court’s\nproposed faculty hiring goals would “effectively turn the purpose of the desegregation\nremedy on its head” through the discriminatory hiring and recruitment of faculty:\n\n        Compliance with the district court’s new faculty assignment plan in this\n        case could require racially discriminatory hirings and firings. If, in any\n        given year, the Board has too few black faculty to staff each school\n        within 15% of the systemwide student body, it must fire non-black\n        faculty and hire an equivalent number of black faculty in order to meet\n        the court’s requirements. This bizarre and unconstitutional reshuffling\n        would be repeated as the student population in Shelby County shifts as\n        a result of annexation or changing residential patterns, leaving more\n        teachers jobless with every racial recount of the student body.\n        As the Supreme Court stated in Swann, “where it is possible to identify a ‘white\nschool’ or a ‘Negro school’ simply by reference to the racial composition of teachers and\nstaff,” there is a prima facie constitutional violation. Swann, 402 U.S. at 18; see also\nGreen, 391 U.S. at 434-35. We find ourselves in agreement with Chief Justice Roberts\nthat “[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the\nbasis of race.” Parents Involved in Cmty. Schools v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S.\n701 (2007) (plurality). Race-based hiring of the sort ordered by the district court\nviolates the Constitution.\n\n        Moreover, we agree with the United States that the district court’s assertion that\neach child is constitutionally entitled to “educational guidance which includes teachers\nof the student’s own race” is invalid. The Constitution requires only that schools be\nstaffed so that no school is racially identifiable based on governmental action.\nMontgomery County Bd. of Educ., 395 U.S. at 236. As the United States correctly\ncontends,\n\n        Taken to heart, the court’s “role model” principle could lead to an\n        increase in racially identifiable schools as majority black schools are\n        increasingly staffed with black faculty. Conversely, the “role model”\n        theory “could be used to escape the obligation to remedy [hiring\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 17\n\n\n       discrimination] by justifying the small percentage of black teachers by\n       reference to the small percentage of black students.” Wygant v. Jackson\n       Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 276 (1986).\n       In Wygant, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the “role model theory” as a\nbasis for racially based layoff protections because it “allows the Board to engage in\ndiscriminatory hiring and layoff practices long past the point required by any legitimate\nremedial purpose.” Id. at 275. The district court’s ruling in the instant case directly\ncontradicts this principle.\n\n       Finally, as previously discussed supra, the record clearly shows that the racial\ndisparity ratio from school to school for teachers is not the product of a constitutional\nviolation, but of other demographic trends. Therefore, the vestiges of the post-\nconstitutional violation regarding faculty integration have not been demonstrated. In\nlight of the abundant evidence of the Board’s good faith efforts to recruit and hire\nminority faculty despite a state-wide minority teacher shortage, the district court abused\nits discretion in failing to afford greater weight to the factual basis submitted by the\nparties on this issue and in denying their joint motion.\n\n                              C. Extracurricular Activities\n\n       The district court also denied the parties’ joint motion for unitary status regarding\nextracurricular activities. The only explanation for this ruling is the following footnote:\n“The Court determined that the issue of extra-curricular activities requires further\ninquiry before declaring unitary status as to that area.”\n\n       We conclude that the district court clearly erred by rejecting, without\nexplanation, the joint motion of the parties. “[T]he district court must clearly set forth\nin the record its reasons for approving [or rejecting] the settlement in order to make\nmeaningful appellate review possible. This is particularly important in civil rights class\nactions.” Armstrong, 616 F.2d at 315 (citations omitted). Absent reasons and evidence\nto the contrary, the joint motion was entitled to substantial weight in the exercise of the\ncourt’s discretion. The victims of defendant’s past violation of the Constitution are\nsatisfied with the commitment and success achieved by the Shelby County Schools in\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.              Page 18\n\n\nthe area of extracurricular activities. Absent a reasonable explanation, the district court\nabused its discretion in ruling otherwise.\n\n                                             V.\n\n        For these reasons, we reverse in part the order of the district court and remand\nwith instructions to grant in full the parties’ joint motion for declaration of unitary status,\ndissolve all outstanding orders and injunctions as to the Board and its members, and\ndismiss this action.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 19\n\n\n                                  _________________\n\n                                        DISSENT\n                                  _________________\n\n        ALGENON L. MARBLEY, District Judge, dissenting. In reversing the district\ncourt’s carefully considered judgment denying unitary status to the Shelby County\nSchools on the subjects of student desegregation, faculty desegregation, and\nextracurricular activities, the majority’s reasoning comes to this: the parties have jointly\nstipulated to dismissal and such compromises should be encouraged by the courts,\nespecially in the divisive realm of school desegregation.\n\n        I have no particular quarrel with this general principle, but I do not believe that\nthe virtues of compromise can compensate for the lack of evidence substantiating that\nthe County has in fact eliminated, to the extent practicable, all remaining vestiges of\nunlawful discrimination. Nothing—not the agreement of the parties jointly to seek\ndissolution of the desegregation decree, not the number of years that this case has been\npending and the general progress in race relations nationwide that has occurred in that\ntime, and not the eagerness of the courts or school boards to restore local control over\ncommunity schools—can substitute for evidence showing the Board’s compliance with\nthe desegregation decree. The evidence in fact reveals that among the forty-four schools\nfor which the Board has data, two thirds of them are not in compliance with the flexible\nbenchmark set forth by the district court for measuring racial balance. Furthermore, the\ndistrict court has been managing this case since 1963. Based on the court’s knowledge\nand experience with this case, it is in the best position to judge the evidence and\ndetermine whether dissolution of the desegregation decree is appropriate at this time.\nBecause the parties have not carried their burden of showing that the racial disparities\nthat continue to plague the County’s schools are not the vestiges of past unlawful\ndiscrimination, I would affirm the district court’s judgment.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.           Page 20\n\n\n                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\n                A. The History of Desegregation in Shelby County\n\n       The majority opinion does not recount the history of this lengthy and complicated\ncase. Because I believe that we must consider the entire record to evaluate properly the\ndistrict court’s judgment, I set forth the most important facts of the case below.\n\n                                      1. 1963-1971\n\n       The years between 1963 and 1971 were by far the most active in the case’s\nhistory. This period was marked by the County’s early intransigence in adopting\nappropriate measures to de-segregate its schools, the intervention of the Department of\nJustice (the “Government”) to pressure the County to take its desegregation obligations\nseriously, and ultimately, in 1971, the district court’s approval (following a reversal and\nremand by this Court) of a comprehensive plan to eliminate the racial identifiability of\nall the County’s schools.\n\n       On June 12, 1963, nine years after Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483\n(1954) was decided, twenty-one public-school students brought this class action against\nthe Shelby County Board of Education (the “Board”) seeking a declaratory injunction\nthat the public schools were unconstitutionally segregated and an injunction requiring\nthe Board to integrate them. (Joint Appendix (“JA”) 156.) In response to the Plaintiffs’\ncomplaint, the Board denied any wrongdoing, but nonetheless submitted a plan to the\ndistrict court, which approved it on March 17, 1964. (JA 156-160.)\n\n       This first effort amounted to no more than a “freedom-of-choice” plan, and it\nbarely qualified as that. “Freedom-of-choice” plans purported to put an end to\nsegregated schools by permitting African-American students voluntarily to choose to\nattend the all-white schools from which they had long been excluded. The Board’s plan,\nhowever, erected numerous obstacles to exercising free choice. It conditioned the\ntransfer of African-American students into white schools on a showing of good behavior,\nacceptable academic performance, sufficient family income, and psychological stability.\n(JA 158.)\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.             Page 21\n\n\n        In 1966, two years after the district court approved the Board’s freedom-of-\nchoice plan, the Government intervened in the case. (JA 160.) In response to a\nGovernment motion criticizing the Board for lack of progress in desegregating its\nschools, the district court entered an order making minor modifications to the decree, but\nthese changes still did not promise to make the mandate of Brown a reality. (JA 162-63.)\nBy 1967, four years after the Plaintiffs filed suit, and thirteen years after Brown, 100\npercent of white students attended the formerly all-white schools and 98.7 percent of\nAfrican-American students attended the formerly all-black schools. (JA 165.)\n\n        On January 19, 1967, in response to another Government motion contending that\nthe Board was shirking its desegregation obligations, the district court again modified\nthe decree. (JA 284.) The district court tinkered with the plan to make it slightly easier\nfor African-American students to transfer to the formerly all-white schools, but the\nanemic “freedom-of-choice” approach still ruled the day. Although continuing to fall\nshort in terms of desegregating the student bodies of the Shelby County Schools, the\ndistrict court’s January 19, 1967 order was notable because for the first time it spelled\nout precise benchmarks for desegregating the County’s faculties. (JA 284.) The court\nheld that a faculty would be regarded as desegregated when its racial composition\nreflected the County-wide composition within a deviation of ten percentage points. (JA\n286.) To that end, the court ordered the Board to fill all faculty vacancies with teachers\nwhose race was under-represented in the school at issue. (JA 286.) In addition, the\ndistrict court ordered the Board to implement a program to recruit white teachers to work\nin schools whose faculties were predominantly African-American and African-American\nteachers to work in schools with predominantly white faculties. (JA 287.)\n\n        To measure the Board’s compliance with these requirements, the district court\nordered it to file certain reports on a regular basis. First, before filling a faculty vacancy\nwith a teacher of the over-represented race, the Board was required to notify the Court\nof its intention to do so, as well as explain its efforts to transfer or hire a teacher of the\nunder-represented race and why those efforts failed. (JA 288-89.) In its July 26, 2007\norder declining to dissolve the desegregation decree, the district court found that\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363             Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.       Page 22\n\n\nthroughout this litigation, the Board has never once filed this report before\ntransferring/hiring a teacher of the over-represented race to fill a vacancy.1\n\n        Second, the Board was instructed to submit, on August 1 of each year, a report\nproviding data on the racial make-up of the faculty in each school, as well as the number\nof vacancies that were filled by faculty of the over-represented race. (JA 289.) The\nAugust 1 report was to be supplemented on October 1 of each year. (JA 289.)\n\n        On August 1, 1967, the Board submitted its first annual report on teacher\ndesegregation. This report showed that the Board employed 1500 teachers. Pursuant\nto the district court’s order that the Board re-assign teachers of the opposite race “in all\ncases in which the transfer can be accomplished without seriously impairing the\neducational program,” (JA 287), the Board reported that it had re-assigned just 128\nteachers, or 8.5 percent of the total number. The Board’s October supplement showed\nthat of the 200 vacancies filled for the upcoming school year, only twelve of these were\nfilled by teachers of the under-represented race.\n\n        On May 27, 1968, the Supreme Court decided Green v. County School Board of\nNew Kent County, 391 U.S. 430 (1968). There, the Court held that “freedom-of-choice”\nplans were generally inadequate to satisfy the mandate of Brown. Leaving no doubt\nabout the gravity of the responsibility facing local school boards, the Green Court stated,\n“The burden on a school board today is to come forward with a plan that promises\nrealistically to work, and promises realistically to work now.” Id. at 439. School boards\nwere instructed to take whatever remedial steps were required to eliminate racial\ndiscrimination “root and branch.” Id. at 438.\n\n        The district court issued another order on July 17, 1968, clarifying the Board’s\ndesegregation responsibilities in light of Green. (JA 171.) As to faculty desegregation,\nthe court reiterated that the ratio of African-American to white teachers in each school\nwas to reflect the County-wide ratio within a margin of ten percentage points. The court\nheld that this ratio had to be satisfied in the County’s elementary schools (defined as\n\n\n        1\n            The Board does not dispute this finding.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.           Page 23\n\n\ngrades one through six) by the start of the 1968-69 school year and that it was to be met\nin the remainder of the County’s schools by the start of the 1969-70 school year. (JA\n172.) The court further ordered the Board to prepare a new desegregation plan designed\nto accomplish these goals and otherwise eliminate the racial identifiability of the\nCounty’s schools. (JA 172.)\n\n       On August 15, 1968, the district court provided additional guidance about the\npreparation of the Board’s new desegregation plan. (JA 173.) For the first time, the\ndistrict court set a benchmark for desegregating the County’s student bodies. The court\nruled that insofar as feasible, the Board should assign students so that the ratio of\nAfrican-American to white students in each school reflected the County-wide ratio,\nwithin a margin of ten percentage points. (JA 173.)\n\n       The Board submitted its post-Green plan for the district court’s review on\nJanuary 15, 1969. This plan did not come anywhere close to achieving the student racial\nbalance that the district court had ordered. (JA 175.) The Board admitted that its plan\ndid not require the desegregation of high school students, but instead permitted them to\nremain in the high schools that they were already attending. (JA 175.) As to faculty\ndesegregation, the Board sought relief from the obligation of achieving any particular\nracial ratio among high school teachers, let alone that specified by the district court (a\nblack-to-white ratio in each school that reflected the ratio in the County as a whole, plus\nor minus ten percentage points). (JA 174.) The Board argued that the work of\ndesegregating high school faculties was made more difficult by the fact that these\nteachers were licensed in particular subject areas.\n\n       The Plaintiffs and the Government opposed the Board’s post-Green plan as\ninadequate. (JA 175-78.) The district court nonetheless approved it.\n\n       On April 6, 1970, the district court approved certain modifications to the Board’s\ndesegregation plan. See Robinson v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ., 311 F. Supp. 97, 104-\n05 (W.D. Tenn. 1970). Importantly, the court backed away from its earlier insistence\nthat the County achieve a student racial composition within each school that reflected\nthe County racial composition within ten percentage points. Rather, the court held that\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 24\n\n\nthe Board was not required to achieve any particular degree of racial balance among its\nstudents and that the most that could be asked was for the Board to “honestly draw[]\nunitary geographical zone lines, that is, zones not gerrymandered to preserve segregation\n. . . .” Id. at 102. The court stood by its prior pronouncements with respect to faculty\ndesegregation but added the caveat that efforts to de-segregate high school teachers\nshould be tempered by considerations of their qualifications. The court stated, “to the\nextent feasible, in the light of the qualifications of the teachers and the need for teachers\nof particular qualifications in the [secondary] school, such teachers will be assigned and\ntransferred so that the ratio of white to Negro teachers in each school will be, within a\ntolerance of 10%, the same as in the system as a whole.” Id. at 105.\n\n        On appeal of the district court’s April 6, 1970 order, this Court remanded the\ncase for further consideration of the County’s desegregation obligations. See Robinson\nv. Shelby County Bd. of Education, 442 F.2d 255, 258 (6th Cir. 1971). This Court held\nthat the district court had misapprehended the extent of the County’s affirmative duty\nto undo the effects of its past discriminatory conduct. Id. at 258 (“Where there has been\na history of state-imposed segregation of the schools, it is not sufficient to adopt a plan\nwhich, out of context, might be seen as nondiscriminatory but which does not do as\nmuch to disestablish segregation as an alternative proposal which is feasible and\npedagogically sound.”).\n\n        In response, the district court approved a revised desegregation plan in August\n1971. See Robinson v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ., 330 F. Supp. 837, 843-47 (W.D.\nTenn. 1971), aff’d 467 F.2d 1187 (6th Cir. 1972). This plan was largely that advanced\nby the Board, but the district court also accepted certain suggestions from the Title IV\nCenter at the University of Tennessee, as well as the Government. Id. at 843. This latest\neffort apparently dealt exclusively with student desegregation. Id.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 25\n\n\n                                      2. 1971-2006\n\n        The Board’s 1971 desegregation plan approved by the district court marked the\nlast substantial revision to the Board’s desegregation efforts in the history of this case.\nIt was also virtually the last time that either the Plaintiffs or the Government challenged\nany of the Board’s decisions as contrary to its desegregation obligations, or argued that\nthe Board was not complying with the plan’s requirements. Perhaps due in large part to\nthe lack of adversarial litigation, the record is rather thin on evidence showing what\nprogress, if any, the Board made toward dismantling the vestiges of unlawful\ndiscrimination in its schools. It appears that neither the Plaintiffs, the Government, nor\nthe district court required much in the way of statistical data tracking the racial\ncomposition of the County’s students and faculty over time.\n\n        To begin with, very little can be gleaned from the record about what was\nhappening with student desegregation. There is almost no evidence documenting the\nracial composition of each school from year to year (and comparing that to the County-\nwide ratio), the indicators the Board used, if any, to gauge its progress, the obstacles the\nBoard confronted, or how it made decisions in operating the County’s schools to ensure\nits full compliance with the desegregation decree. The definition of “success” and the\nBoard’s path to arrive there are not clear. For instance, between August 20, 1974 and\nAugust 3, 2004, the district court entered more than fifty consent orders modifying the\ndecree as to such things as school-attendance zones and new-school construction. (JA\n192-234.) It appears that the Board rarely provided information about the impact these\nmodifications would have on the student racial composition of each of the schools. The\nrecord suggests that the Board often did no more than conclusorily state that the changes\nwere not expected to have any deleterious effects on the desegregation plan. (See, e.g.,\nJA 219-26.)\n\n        Moreover, Plaintiffs rarely interposed any objections to the Board’s plans and the\nsame was true of the Government. On one of the few occasions that serious opposition\nto the Board’s plans was lodged, the district court found that the Board had allowed\nimproper considerations to trump its desegregation duties. The dispute centered on the\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.             Page 26\n\n\nBoard’s desire in 1985 to add ten new classrooms to an overwhelmingly white\nelementary school to alleviate over-crowding. (JA 203.) The Government opposed the\nconstruction project (it does not appear that the Plaintiffs joined the Government),\nclaiming that the Board impermissibly wanted to avoid utilizing the excess capacity of\nnearby elementary schools with significant African-American populations. (JA 203-04.)\nOn April 8, 1986, the district court denied the Board’s petition to build the extra\nclassrooms. (JA 209.) The court agreed with the Government that the Board had failed\nto give due consideration to its desegregation obligations, and that it had elevated\n“community pride” (meaning the community pride of the white elementary school\nstudents and parents) in preserving present enrollment at the over-crowded elementary\nschool over its duty to eliminate unlawful discrimination. (JA 209-10.)\n\n       The record regarding faculty desegregation between 1971 and 2006 is only\nslightly more robust. After the Board’s initial report on August 1, 1967, the record is\nsilent about the Board’s efforts to re-assign teachers. As noted above, the Board\nreported that it had re-assigned 8.5 percent of its teachers, effective during the 1967-68\nschool year. The record does not disclose whether the Board undertook any more re-\nassignment efforts after 1967. Certainly, the Board does not state in its briefing to this\nCourt that it did so, nor does it point to any evidence of such. Thus, it appears that in\nresponse to the district court’s January 19, 1967 order, the Board had done all the faculty\nre-assigning it intended to do by August 1, 1967.\n\n       With respect to teacher transfers to fill vacancies, the district court had instructed\nthe Board to file annual reports showing the number of openings filled by teachers of the\nover-represented and under-represented race. Between 1974 and 1979, the Board’s\nreports show that half the time, a majority of vacancies were not filled by teachers of\nthe under-represented race (as ordered by the district court). (JA 133; 194-95; 198-201.)\nIt appears that the Board stopped reporting this statistic altogether by 1981. Neither the\nPlaintiffs, the Government, nor the district court seems to have taken issue with the\nBoard’s abandonment of this requirement. In addition, although the Board was supposed\nto notify the court before filling a vacancy with a teacher of the over-represented race\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.          Page 27\n\n\nand justify its inability to employ an opposite-race teacher, the record is bereft of any\nevidence that the Board ever did so, and the Board does not dispute that it did not.\n\n       Besides the Board’s lackluster track record as to faculty re-assignment and\nvacancies, the record discloses another deeply disturbing trend. Between 1974 and\n2006, the total percentage of African-American faculty at the County’s schools declined\nmarkedly. The Board’s 1974 annual report showed that thirty-three percent of the\nCounty’s faculty were African-American, which correlates closely to the fact that around\nthis same period, thirty percent of the County’s students were African-American. In\n2006, only fifteen percent of the County’s faculty were African-American, even though\naround this same period, a significantly higher percentage, thirty-four percent, of the\nCounty’s students were African-American.\n\n       In August 1989, the district court was so disturbed by the decline in the Board’s\nemployment of African-American teachers that it asked the parties to address the\nquestion of whether the Board’s reports “for the reporting period of August 1, 1985, to\nAugust 1, 1989, indicate an employment practice or policy within the Shelby County\nSchools which achieves a gradual but definite decline in the number of black teachers\nemployed by the school system.” (JA 214.) The Board responded that the problem was\nattributable to fewer African-American people becoming teachers. (JA 214.) The\nGovernment had a different position, noting that between 1972 and 1989, the number of\nwhite teachers had more than doubled, but the number of African-American teachers had\nremained virtually the same, that the Board had “recruited almost 10 times as many\nwhite applicants as black applicants,” and that its offer rate for white candidates was\nmuch higher than for African-American candidates. (JA 215.) The Government also\ncited statistics showing that the Memphis City Schools (located within Shelby County,\nbut not part of the Shelby County school system) did a much better job of recruiting\nAfrican-American applicants, even though the starting salary for teachers in Memphis\nwas slightly less than that offered by the Board. (JA 215-16.) The Government also\nargued that the Board was much less proactive than it could have been in its outreach to\ncolleges and universities, particularly to historically African-American colleges. (JA\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.          Page 28\n\n\n216.) On July 3, 1990, the district court ordered the Board to submit supplemental\nannual reports regarding its minority recruiting practices. (JA 218.)\n\n       The Board filed regular supplemental reports on minority recruiting between\n1990 and 2006. These reports both confirm that the Board expanded its outreach to\ncolleges and universities, including historically African-American colleges, and provide\ndata on the offer rates for African-American and white candidates. In the early years,\noffer rates for African-American candidates sometimes exceeded those for white\ncandidates; but by 1997, offers to white candidates always outpaced offers to African-\nAmerican candidates, sometimes significantly. See, e.g., JA 228 (October 1999 report\nshowing that twenty-six percent of African-American applicants interviewed through the\ncentral office were given offers, compared to fifty-one percent of white applicants).\n\n       Thus, the extent of the Board’s compliance with the desegregation decree\nbetween 1971 and 2006 is difficult to assess. During that time, the Plaintiffs never\nchallenged any of the Board’s decisions. Similarly, the Board did not apprise the court\n(and the court apparently did not inquire) of any factors that impeded its progress\ndesegregating as much as practicable or any steps it took to alleviate those impediments.\nThe Board did not even bother to submit the required reports on faculty desegregation.\nWhether the racial disparities that continue to mark the Shelby County Schools are due\nto reasons wholly unrelated to the ongoing effects of unlawful discrimination, as the\nmajority contends, or whether the Board could and should have done more to attain its\ndesegregation objectives, are not answered by the record as it existed at the time the\nparties moved for dissolution of the decree. Moreover, as described below, the parties\ndid not fill this evidentiary gap at the two hearings conducted by the district court to\nconsider their motion.\n\n             3. The Joint Motion to Dissolve the Desegregation Decree\n\n       On August 14, 2006, the Plaintiffs and the Board jointly moved for an order\ndissolving the desegregation decree and declaring the public schools “unitary.” The\nparties asserted that they had fully complied with the decree and that they had met the\nstandards articulated by the Supreme Court for eliminating the effects of past de jure\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.           Page 29\n\n\nsegregation. Despite the joint nature of the application, the district court recognized that\nit “ha[d] an obligation to independently evaluate these factors and the evidence to assure\nthat the system as it exist[s] now is truly unitary and color blind.” (JA 1187.) The court\ntherefore held evidentiary hearings on January 26, 2007 and July 23, 2007.\n\n        The two hearings consisted largely of anecdotal testimony by school officials and\nparents. For example, Superintendent Bobby G. Webb testified that his staff worked\ndiligently to adjust school attendance zones to make sure that the County has “good\ncommunity-based schools and have them as diverse as we possibly can.” (JA 1204.) He\nstated, “I can tell you without a doubt that—that all of the staff that I have to work with\n. . . certainly love and respect every child regardless of their color, background or\nwhatever . . . .” (JA 1205.) When asked by the district court what evidence it should\nconsider in determining whether the Board’s efforts to promote color blindness will\ncontinue in the absence of court monitoring, Webb responded: “I personally can assure\nyou that as long as I’m superintendent there will be no discrimination in any shape, form,\nor fashion.” (JA 1230.)\n\n        Assistant Superintendent of Planning and Student Service Maura Sullivan\ntestified that she had worked closely with Plaintiffs’ counsel over the years to adjust\nattendance zones based on enrollment projections and assess the impact of the\nadjustments on school demographics. (JA 1239-40.) Assistant Superintendent Lois\nWilliams described the County’s efforts to recruit minority teachers. She identified the\nbiggest barrier to minority-teacher recruitment as the shrinking teaching pool overall and\nthe shortage among minority candidates in particular. (JA 1315.) The Board’s goal,\naccording to Williams, is for fourteen percent of the teachers in each of the County’s\nschools to be minorities. (JA 1302.)\n\n        During the July 23, 2007 hearing, the Plaintiffs and the Board called two parents\nto testify. The first, Ricky Jeans, had himself been a student in the Shelby County\nSchools in the late 1960s and had been one of the first African-American students to\nattend a formerly all-white school. (JA 1378-79.) Jeans testified in favor of dissolving\nthe desegregation decree, stating, “I think that it’s time that we—we look backwards and\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.             Page 30\n\n\nsee where we started at and look at the improvement of the system and what has gone\non down through the years and support maybe dropping the system from this point on,\nbut I am a big advocate of the Shelby County school system.” (JA 1379.) The second,\nBrenda Gipson, testified that the Shelby County Schools had become more diverse both\nin their student bodies and faculties since she had been involved with them through her\nchildren. Gipson testified that school administrators are “for an environment of\ninclusiveness—inclusiveness, they go out of their way to make sure that everyone feels\nimportant in the school system.” (JA 1387.) Finally, Gipson testified that some schools\nin the County have a largely African-American student body but that “obviously most\nof the ones in my area are predominantly white.” (JA 1388.)\n\n        The evidence presented at the two hearings was thus largely anecdotal and based\non the personal views of the interested parties and two parents. Neither the Board nor\nPlaintiffs put any school-desegregation experts on the stand to testify about the Board’s\nperformance since the desegregation decree was imposed. Neither party put any\nwitnesses on the stand to opine that the Board had achieved desegregation to the extent\nfeasible or that it had availed itself of all opportunities to desegregate. Finally, there was\nno expert testimony about demographic changes in the County or about how such\nchanges should be interpreted in light of the fact that the Board had formerly practiced\nde jure segregation.\n\n                             B. The District Court’s Order\n\n        On July 26, 2007, the district court issued a sixty-two page opinion,\nsupplemented by a one-hundred-and-sixteen page “Procedural Appendix” of the case.\nThe district court granted the parties’ joint motion as to facilities, transportation, and\nstaffing, finding that there was no evidence that the Board had been discriminatory over\nthe last few decades in managing these aspects of the schools. (JA 115.) A declaration\nof unitary status was therefore found to be appropriate as to these three areas. The court,\nhowever, denied the joint motion as to student assignment, faculty assignment, and\nextracurricular activities and held that the court would continue to supervise these areas.\n(JA 116.)\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.           Page 31\n\n\n                                 1. Student Assignment\n\n       The district court found that by 1971, the Board had begun to make real progress\ntoward desegregating the student bodies of its schools. (JA 106.) Still, “at least a\nquarter of the schools remained outside the target racial composition range established\nby the [court].” (JA 107.) The court also noted that by 1984, the proportion of African-\nAmerican students in each school continued to be “uneven,” with three schools out of\nthirty-four having fewer than five percent African-American students and three having\nbetween fifty and seventy percent. (JA 108.) These disparities have only widened. The\ndistrict court found that by the 2004-05 school year, only seventeen of the County’s\nforty-six schools had a racial make-up that reflected, within ten percentage points, the\nracial make-up of the County as a whole. (JA 108.) Moreover, the County’s new “state-\nof-the-art” high school is expected to have an eighty-eight percent or higher African-\nAmerican student population. (JA 108.)\n\n       The district court concluded that “[t]he Board has made no showing that racial\nbalance is infeasible either generally or with regard to certain schools.” (JA 111.) The\ncourt further found that “the record does not indicate that the County has at any time\naccomplished its objectives . . . .” (JA 111.) The racial compositions of the student\nbodies of the individual schools relative to the County as a whole are important,\nreasoned the court, because such concrete and detailed statistics enable a court to gauge\nprogress towards eliminating the “racial identifiability” of schools, which is the key to\nachieving unitary status. Without a statistical comparison, the court said it would be left\nto “rely on anecdotal evidence, gut feelings, and assurances from defendants that they\n‘love and respect every child regardless of their color—hardly a proper basis for making\nmomentous legal decisions.” (JA 110.) At the same time, the court recognized that\n“racial balance is not a strict requirement and there may be mitigating circumstances\nwhich would allow a school system to operate one or more schools with a predominance\nof one race or another without running afoul of its equal protection obligations . . . .”\n(JA 109.)\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.           Page 32\n\n\n       With these principles in mind, the district court directed the Board to work\ntoward achieving racial balance in all its schools, which it defined as a student racial\ncomposition in each school that mirrors the County-wide ratio within a margin of fifteen\npercentage points. (JA 117.) The court characterized this benchmark as a “flexible\ngoal” and “a starting point in analyzing the Board’s success in desegregation.” (JA 117.)\n\n                                 2. Faculty Assignment\n\n       The district court declined to grant unitary status as to faculty assignment,\nfinding that the Board had not exhibited good-faith compliance with the court’s prior\ndesegregation orders. (JA 102-03.) The court found it “somewhat astonishing” that the\nBoard reassigned only 128 teachers out of 1500 in response to the order directing that\nthis be done “in all cases” provided that the educational program was not seriously\nimpaired. (JA 103.) The court was also troubled by the lack of full compliance with the\nrequirements for transferring teachers when vacancies arose.           The district court\nconcluded that\n\n       Strict compliance with the new faculty integration requirement would\n       have almost surely effected a very rapid transition to a system where the\n       faculty at each school was reflective of the systemwide racial\n       composition. This seems apparent because practically any vacancy at a\n       school whose faculty was racially disproportionate would have set off a\n       chain of intra-system transfers which would only stop when either\n       complete racial balance was achieved or a vacancy resulted which was\n       impossible to fill from within the system.\n(JA 102.) Finally, the district court observed that the Board had “utter[ly] disregard[ed]”\nthe requirement that it notify the court before filling a faculty opening with a teacher of\nthe over-represented race. (JA 103.) The district court concluded that the wide gulf\nbetween the proportion of African-American teachers at various schools in the County\ntoday, ranging from a low of five percent to a high of thirty percent, showed that the\nBoard’s efforts were wanting. (JA 112.)\n\n       When it came to fashioning a remedy, the court disavowed its earlier approach\nof aiming to have a percentage of African-American teachers in each school that\nmirrored the percentage of African-American teachers in the County. (JA 113.) This\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.          Page 33\n\n\napproach, said the court, “created the perverse incentive to allow the overall black\nfaculty representation to slip . . . .” (JA 113.) The court feared that the Board could\nreduce the County-wide percentage of African-American teachers by terminating\nAfrican-American teachers. As the County-wide percentage fell, so too could the\npercentage required in each school, without raising the specter of any disparity between\nthe two. (JA 113.)\n\n       Having identified what it deemed to be a fatal flaw with its longstanding method\nof measuring progress toward faculty desegregation, the district court came up with\nanother method. It ruled that, henceforth, the proper comparison would be between the\npercentage of African-American teachers in a school and the percentage of African-\nAmerican students in the County. (JA 114.) Thus, since the County’s African-American\nstudent population stood at thirty-four percent in 2007, each school should endeavor to\nachieve that proportion of African-American teachers. The district court ruled that this\napproach was consistent with ensuring that African-American students were not\n“isolated” in their educational experience as a result of too few African-American\nteachers in their classrooms. (JA 114.) The court stated that “if a black child is allowed\nto attend a previously all-white school, but is denied educational guidance which\nincludes teachers of the student’s own race, the student is unacceptably isolated and\ndeprived of a full educational experience.” (JA 114.) The Court concluded that a\nconcern about the possible “isolation” of African-American students was an\n“unarticulated principle that . . . animates the Supreme Court’s emphasis on the\nimportance of a diverse faculty.” (JA 114.) Thus, the district court ordered the Board\nto work toward a faculty racial balance that would mirror the proportion of African-\nAmerican students in the County as a whole, within a margin of fifteen percentage\npoints. Just as with the student-assignment goal, the court treated this faculty goal as\n“flexible” and “a starting point in analyzing the Board’s success . . . .” (JA 117.)\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363           Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.                  Page 34\n\n\n                                 3. Extracurricular Activities\n\n        The district court also declined to grant unitary status with respect to the Board’s\nsponsorship of student extracurricular activities, but the district court did not separately\nexplain this decision.2\n\n        Following the January hearing, the district court asked the Board to submit\nadditional statistical data relating to several different aspects of the County schools. One\nof the things the Court requested was “demographic data on students participating in all\nextracurricular activities.” (JA 479.) The Board admitted that it has not typically\nmaintained records tracking this type of information. Owing to a similar request by the\nTennessee Board of Education, however, the Board compiled what information it could,\nwhich turned out to be a chart showing the percentage of African-American and white\nstudents in thirty out of the County’s forty-eight schools that participate in\nextracurricular activities. (JA 486.) Thus, data for eighteen schools was completely\nomitted. Moreover, the chart provides only the students’ participation rate by race; it\ndoes not explain what the Board or individual schools deem to be extracurricular\nactivities, or African-American and white students’ participation rates within specific\nactivities.\n\n                       4. Other Aspects of the District Court’s Order\n\n        The district court acknowledged that its management of the case had not been\noptimally tailored to helping the Board achieve unitary status. The court said that its\n“failure to adopt clear and unequivocal guidelines for achievement of the [c]ourt’s goals\nis in large part responsible for the fact that the County is seeking unitary status some\nforty-four years after this suit was first filed . . . .” (JA 116.) Pointing to the fact that the\nPlaintiffs and the County had been in “lock step” with one another for much of the last\nthirty years and that there had been “few, if any, contested issues, and only nominal\nlitigation,” the district court acknowledged the need for it to take a more hands-on\n\n\n        2\n           The Board presented minimal evidence on this subject, which may explain the absence of the\ndistrict court’s explanation on its decision.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 35\n\n\napproach to supervising the litigation with an eye to bringing it to a conclusion in the\nnear future. The court stated that it had “largely served to ‘rubber-stamp’ the County’s\nunopposed construction and zoning requests with little or no meaningful review of how\nsuch proposals contributed to or detracted from the County’s overall progress toward\nunitary status . . . . The joint motion to dismiss compels the [c]ourt to resume a more\nsubstantive role in bringing the County school system’s desegregation process to a\nlegitimate closure.” (JA 115-16.)\n\n        Besides the “flexible” benchmarks the district court set for evaluating the\nBoard’s student and faculty desegregation efforts, the district court also set timetables\nfor achieving them. The court set October 2012 as the target date for full compliance.\n(JA 119.) After three years of full compliance, the court said it would dissolve the\ndesegregation decree. (JA 119.)\n\n        Next, the district court ordered the Board to submit data annually concerning the\nracial composition of each school’s students and teachers. The Board was further\ninstructed to provide information about “mitigating factors, including infeasibility of\nfurther desegregation and shifting demographics, as appropriate.” (JA 118.) The Board\nwas to continue submitting notices of school construction plans and attendance-zone\nmodifications to the court until the desegregation decree was dissolved. Contrary to the\nperfunctory nature of similar reports filed in the past, the court clarified that all such\nplans are to include a comprehensive discussion of what impact the construction and\nattendance-zone changes will have on the Board’s desegregation efforts. (JA 119.)\n\n        Finally, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53, the district court said it\nwould appoint a special master to consider the statistical data supplied by the parties and\nto make annual reports and recommendations to the court. (JA 117-18.) The court\ninstructed the parties jointly to select a special master with the requisite qualifications,\nwhich the court defined as a “neutral expert in educational research, preferably with\nexperience in desegregation issues . . . .” (JA 118.)\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 36\n\n\n                                     II. ANALYSIS\n\n        The record shows that the district court was both thorough and careful in\nconsidering the petition to declare the Shelby County Schools unitary. As a threshold\nmatter, the court held two public hearings, both of which involved witness testimony,\nargument by counsel, and the opportunity for participation by members of the\ncommunity. All parties were allowed to call and cross-examine witnesses, and the court\nasked questions as well. Following each hearing, the court asked the parties to provide\nspecific additional information. Just a few days after the second hearing, the court\nissued its opinion which, at sixty-two pages, gave comprehensive consideration to the\nentire history of the case, identified and discussed the relevant Supreme Court authority,\nand set forth a precise plan designed to eventually eliminate the need for the\ndesegregation decree and restore local control . The court also appended to its opinion\na 116-page procedural history of the case.\n\n        Before specifically addressing each of the three areas in which the district court\ndeclined to grant unitary status, it is important to clarify what the district court’s order\ndid and did not do. Contrary to the Board’s argument (repeated throughout its brief), the\ndistrict court did not order the Board to comply with a “strict racial quota.” True, the\ndistrict court held that the Board should endeavor to achieve a ratio of white to African-\nAmerican students in each school that mirrors the racial composition of the County-wide\nstudent population within fifteen percentage points, and that the Board should seek to\nachieve the same racial balance with respect to faculty. But the district court plainly\ncharacterized this as a “flexible goal” and “a starting point in analyzing the Board’s\nsuccess in desegregation.” Correctly citing applicable Supreme Court precedent, the\ndistrict court expressly rejected a rigid approach, saying that “racial balance is not a\nstrict requirement and there may be mitigating circumstances which would allow a\nschool system to operate one or more schools with a predominance of one race or\nanother without running afoul of its equal protection obligations under the Constitution.”\nThe district court also specifically instructed the Board to submit annually information\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363              Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.                         Page 37\n\n\ndescribing “mitigating factors” that make further progress toward racial balance\ninfeasible.\n\n         The Board appeals the district court’s order in its entirety. Although the\nGovernment supported a declaration of unitary status below, it does not appeal the\ndistrict court’s rulings retaining supervisory control. The Government says that it has\n“chosen not to appeal the denial of unitary status in light of the deferential clear error\nstandard of review that applies to that determination.” (Govt. Br. 29.) With respect to\nthe district court’s modification of the decree, establishing a “flexible” student-\nassignment goal, the Government concedes that it is “hard pressed to argue on appeal\nthat the district court’s ruling to the contrary was clear error, or that the student\nassignment goals that the court put in place to remedy the remaining racial imbalance\nin Shelby County’s schools are an abuse of discretion.” (Id.) The Government,\nhowever, is appealing the district court’s teacher-assignment goal on the ground that the\ncourt’s tying of the faculty racial ratio to the student racial ratio was an abuse of\ndiscretion.\n\n        1. The County Has Not Carried Its Burden as to Student Desegregation3\n\n         The Board argues that it has fully complied with the court’s orders regarding\ndesegregating its students. The record evidence is simply inadequate to support this\nassertion.\n\n         As an initial matter, there is no indication that the Board regularly reported to the\nCourt about the racial make-up of each of its schools relative to the County as a whole.\nStatistical data of this sort is largely absent from the record. Consequently, we cannot\nknow how the Board fared with respect to the court’s original student-desegregation goal\n(identical racial ratios in the schools and County within a deviation of ten percentage\n\n         3\n            In the specific setting of a school desegregation class action, “[w]here the relief sought in the\ndistrict court is the dissolution of a[ ] [desegregation decree], the order of the district court is subject to a\nmixed standard of review.” Manning ex rel. Manning v. School Bd. Of Hillsborough County, 244 F.3d\n927, 940 (11th Cir. 2001). The district court’s application of the law is subject to de novo review, while\nthe court’s factual findings, including its determination that a school district has not achieved unitary\nstatus, fall under the clearly erroneous standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). Id. (citations\nomitted); Holton v. City of Thomasville School Dist., 425 F.3d 1325, 1336 (11th Cir. 2005) (citations\nomitted).\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363          Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.               Page 38\n\n\npoints). As to those years for which there is more comprehensive data, the district court\nfound that the Board’s results were unimpressive. For instance, the court found that in\n1974, at least a quarter of the County’s schools had not attained “the target racial\ncomposition range established by the [c]ourt in 1968 and reiterated in . . . 1971 . . . .”\n(JA 106-07.) The court went on to note that “[c]uriously missing from the Board’s\nsubmissions was any explanation of why one school had only 2% African-American\nstudents while a handful of others had as much as 71%.” (JA 107.) The district court\nfound that by 1984, “[t]he racial balance in the schools continued to be uneven, with\nthree schools out of 34 having fewer than 5% African-American students and three\nhaving between 50% and 72%.” (JA 107-08.) Finally, the district court noted that in the\n2004-05 school year, only seventeen of the County’s forty-six schools “had a racial\nmakeup that was reflective, within ten percentage points, of the 32% African-American\nstudent composition of the district as a whole.” (JA 108.)\n\n        It is also difficult to evaluate the import of what little statistical data is available.\nIt is impossible to assess whether that data reflects all the desegregation that was feasible\nin Shelby County, or whether that data only reflects the desegregation that the County\nfound comfortable. This is the case because the record is virtually silent about what\nobstacles the Board confronted in meeting its desegregation obligations throughout the\n1970s and 1980s, how it handled those obstacles, and whether it pursued all practicable\nforms of relief or limited itself to only the most convenient ones.\n\n        The Board relies heavily on a chart detailing statistical data about the proportion\nof African-American students in each of its schools during the 2002-03 and 2007-08\nschool years. The Board claims that this evidence shows that County schools have\nbecome more diverse over the last five years. The Board’s data shows, however, that\namong the forty-four schools for which it has data (five schools were new), the African-\nAmerican student population in 2007-08 still varied widely, from a low of three percent\nto a high of ninety percent. If the County-wide African-American student population\nwas thirty-four percent in 2007, as the Board claims, then only fifteen of the forty-four\nschools for which the Board has demographic data would satisfy the district court’s\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363           Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.                 Page 39\n\n\nbenchmark for measuring racial balance, namely plus or minus fifteen percentage points\nfrom thirty-four percent (racially balanced schools using this metric would be those with\nan African-American student population of between nineteen and forty-nine percent).4\nJust ten of the County’s forty-four schools would satisfy the district court’s earlier goal\nof a school racial composition that mirrored the County’s within a margin of ten\npercentage points.\n\n        Finally, the Board insists that any current disparities in the racial composition of\nits schools are caused by demographic factors unrelated to its history of segregation and\nover which the Board has no control, and the district court has no authority to correct.\nThe Board also argues that annexations by the City of Memphis have affected, and will\ncontinue to affect, the African-American population within the County, making it a\n“moving target.” (Board Br. 9.) This argument may very well have some explanatory\nforce, but the Board did not put on sufficient evidence to substantiate it. As noted above,\nthe witness testimony at the two hearings consisted of little more than bare assertions\nthat the Board had done all it could, that discrimination was not tolerated, and that\nparents and administrators were proud of the school system’s accomplishments. The\nBoard did not present expert testimony about the shifting racial demographics within the\nCounty and how those changes affected the Board’s desegregation efforts. Nor did it\npresent expert testimony about the impact of the annexations by the City of Memphis.\nThe Board’s lack of evidentiary support on these issues stands in marked contrast to the\nevidence others in the Board’s shoes have presented in petitions to dissolve a\ndesegregation decree. See, e.g., Freeman, 503 U.S. at 471 (noting presentation of expert\ntestimony about demographic changes in the school system since the desegregation\ndecree was entered); Manning, 244 F.3d at 936 (noting presentation of “reports on\nattendance boundaries, demographic reports, and expert testimony” to address question\nof whether the racial identifiability of seventeen of the school system’s 150 schools was\ntraceable to the system’s prior discriminatory behavior or to something else). Even the\nGovernment agrees that most of the evidence presented at the July hearing ( in which the\n\n        4\n        The Government agrees. It says that “[i]n 2007, about 60% of the schools varied by more than\n15% from the system-wide racial ratio, with some as high as 90% black.” (Govt. Br. 37.)\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.             Page 40\n\n\nGovernment participated) was anecdotal. The Government notes that, “[t]he Board\npresented no minutes or other records documenting its decision-making and provided\nno demographic statistics or census maps beyond enrollment figures and charted\nattendance zones.” (Govt. Br. at 21.)\n\n        For these reasons, I would affirm the district court’s judgment denying unitary\nstatus on the issue of student desegregation.\n\n      2. The County Has Not Carried Its Burden As To Faculty Desegregation\n\n        The Board contends that the district court erred in failing to grant unitary status\npertaining to faculty integration. The Government contends that the district court erred\nin correlating the percentage of African-American teachers in each school with the\npercentage of African-American students in the County overall. Importantly, neither\nparty challenges the district court’s factual findings that the County did not fully comply\nwith the court’s directives to (1) reassign faculty between schools, (2) transfer opposite-\nrace teachers to fill vacancies, and (3) file the required notices and reports with the court.\nThe Government even concedes that the racial imbalance among the County’s teachers\n“create[s] a presumption against unitary status for faculty” and that “[a]ssignment of\nteachers according to flexible guidelines would not be an abuse of discretion.” The\nGovernment’s position—opposing the district court’s particular remedy but not\ndisagreeing that some type of remedy may be appropriate—implies that it does not\noppose a remand for the district court to re-formulate its faculty-desegregation remedy.\n\n        As described above, the district court modified the desegregation decree to tether\nthe racial composition of each school’s faculty to the racial composition of the County’s\nstudents. The Government opposes this exercise of the district court’s remedial\nauthority as an abuse of discretion, arguing that the proper comparison is the one the\ndistrict court previously endorsed but has since abandoned: comparing the proportion\nof African-American teachers in each school to the proportion of African-American\nteachers County-wide.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363          Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.              Page 41\n\n\n        The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether faculty desegregation may be\naccomplished as the district court has suggested---through a flexible comparison of the\nproportion of African-American teachers in each school to the proportion of African-\nAmerican students in the district as a whole. The Government relies on Wygant v.\nJackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267 (1986) for the proposition that the Supreme\nCourt would disapprove of such a comparison. In Wygant, white teachers with more\nseniority were laid off ahead of African-American teachers, some of whom were merely\non probationary status. Id. at 272. The school board reasoned that this policy was\njustified in order to preserve the gains made in African-American hiring. Id. at 288. The\ndistrict court concluded that the layoffs did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, in\npart, because it determined that African-American students were entitled to role models\nof their own race. Id. at 274. The Supreme Court rejected the district court’s embrace\nof “the role model theory,” concluding that “by tying the required percentage of minority\nteachers to the percentage of minority students, it requires just the sort of year-to-year\ncalibration the Court stated was unnecessary in Swann. Id. at 276. Moreover, the\nSupreme Court reasoned that “[c]arried to its logical extreme, the idea that black\nstudents are better off with black teachers could lead to the very system the Court\nrejected in Brown . . . .” Id. The Court was apparently concerned that if the African-\nAmerican student population shrinks over time, that fact could be used to justify hiring\nfewer African-American teachers. See id. at 276. Conversely, if the African-American\nstudent population increases over time, that would require hiring more African-American\nteachers, which could increase the racial identifiability of the school. See id. Wygant,\nhowever, is distinguishable from this case because the policy imposed resulted in\nlayoffs, as opposed to faculty integration through transfers and reassignments.\n\n        As the Government indicates, this Court has held that a district court overseeing\na desegregation decree does not have the power to set a racial quota for the hiring of\nAfrican-American teachers. In Oliver v. Kalamazoo Education Association, 706 F.2d\n757 (6th Cir. 1983), we stated that “students . . . do not have a constitutional right to\nattend a school with a teaching staff of any particular racial composition . . . . Rather, . . .\nall that the students are entitled to is the sustained good faith effort to recruit minority\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.           Page 42\n\n\nfaculty members so as to remedy the effects of any past discriminatory practices.” Id.\nat 762 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).             Oliver, however, is\ndistinguishable from this case because a rigid racial quota had been imposed for hiring\nteaching staff, as opposed to a flexible goal, which is what was imposed in this case.\n\n       Wygant and Oliver are therefore not on all fours with this case. Moreover, there\nis no reason to fear that the district court’s formulation will tend to increase the racial\nidentifiability of schools, or require a year-to-year re-calibration, as the Government\ncontends. The district court tied its faculty hiring goal to the African-American student\npopulation in the County as a whole, not the African-American student population in\neach school. Thus, a school with a student body that is fifty-five percent African-\nAmerican need not aim for a faculty that is fifty-five percent African-American. Rather,\nusing the 2007 County-wide statistic of thirty-four percent African-American students,\nsuch a school would endeavor to attain a faculty that is thirty-four percent African-\nAmerican, plus or minus fifteen percentage points.\n\n       For these reasons, I would hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin tying the percentage of African-American teachers in each school to the percentage\nof African-American students in the County as a whole.\n\n3. The Board Has Not Carried Its Burden With Respect to Extracurricular Activities\n\n       No more need be said about this. There is no basis for reversing as clearly\nerroneous the district court’s denial of unitary status as to extracurricular activities in\nlight of the almost non-existent record on this subject.\n\n                                  III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons articulated above, I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

This appeal presents the final chapter in the court-\nordered desegregation of the Shelby County, Tennessee, public school system, a process\nwhich began forty-five years ago. In 1963, plaintiff public school students1 filed this\nclass action against defendant Shelby County Board of Education (“Board”) alleging\nunconstitutional racial segregation in the Shelby County schools. In the ensuing period,\nthe district court issued numerous orders requiring the elimination of all vestiges of\nstate-imposed public school segregation in accordance with the mandate of Brown v. Bd.\nof Educ. of Topeka, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954). A court-approved desegregation plan was\nimplemented and in August 2006, after decades of court supervision, the parties moved\njointly to dissolve all outstanding orders, declare the school district a unitary school\nsystem, and terminate the litigation. The United States, which has participated as an\nintervenor since 1966, supported the motion.2\n\n         Despite the parties’ universal agreement that the goals of the desegregation plan\nhave been satisfactorily fulfilled and that educational parity has been attained, the district\ncourt disagreed that the constitutional requirements for unitary status have been met in\nall relevant respects. Consequently, although the court granted the joint motion in regard\nto facilities, transportation, and staffing, it denied the motion as it pertained to the areas\nof student assignment, faculty integration, and extracurricular activities. The district\ncourt established new “racial ratios” for the racial composition of students and faculty\n\n\n\n\n         1\n         At oral argument, counsel asserted that throughout this litigation plaintiffs have been represented\nby the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n         2\n           In its response to the joint motion, the United States advised the district court that “[t]he United\nStates has not received any complaints concerning the district’s compliance with its desegregation\nobligations.” Further, after the conclusion of two “fairness hearings,” see generally UAW v.

The court anticipated that if its\nnew orders were followed, it would end its school supervision by October 2015.3\n\n         Defendant Shelby County Schools now appeals the portion of the district court\norder denying the joint motion for unitary status. The intervenor United States appeals\nthe remedy ordered by the district court for faculty integration.4\n\n         For the reasons stated below, we hold that the district court abused its discretion\nby denying the parties’ joint motion for unitary status regarding student assignment,\nfaculty integration, and extracurricular activities. Accordingly, we reverse, in part, the\norder of the district court and remand with instructions to grant in full the parties’ joint\nmotion for declaration of unitary status, dissolve all outstanding orders and injunctions\nas to the Board and its members, and dismiss this action as to all parties and claims.\n\n                                                       I.\n\n         In general, “‘[t]he acceptance of a settlement in a class action suit is discretionary\nwith the court and will be overturned only by a showing of abuse of discretion.’” Clark\nEquip.

See also Gen. Motors Corp., 497 F.3d at 632\n(noting “the federal policy favoring settlement of class actions”) (citation omitted). This\npolicy applies equally to desegregation cases. See Little Rock Sch. Dist., 921 F.2d at\n1388 (noting that “[a] strong public policy favors agreements, and courts should\napproach them with a presumption in their favor” in ordering the district court to\napprove a desegregation settlement plan.).\n\n        The voluntary settlement of school desegregation controversies is to be\nencouraged, even though such litigation implicates the important civil rights of the\nplaintiff class:\n\n        [D]espite the importance of the substantive rights of the class members,\n        settlement is an appropriate method of arriving at a school desegregation\n        remedy. While courts should be extremely sensitive to the possibilities\n        for abuse where a compromise of the civil rights of a class is proposed,\n        a blanket prohibition of compromise could result, in many cases, in\n        abandonment of the substantial benefits which can result from voluntary\n        resolution of litigation, without a commensurate increase in the\n        protection accorded the civil rights of the class. Indeed, it appears that\n        school desegregation is one of the areas in which voluntary resolution is\n        preferable to full litigation because the spirit of cooperation inherent in\n        good faith settlement is essential to the true long-range success of any\n        desegregation remedy. A remedial decree reached through agreement\n        between the parties may, because of the community cooperation it\n        inspires, more effectively implement the constitutional guarantee of equal\n        protection than a seemingly more stringent court-ordered remedy which\n        the community views as imposed upon it from the outside.\nArmstrong, 616 F.2d at 317-18 (internal citations omitted).\n\n        In Armstrong, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals applied the abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard in affirming the district court’s approval of a settlement agreement\nterminating a public school desegregation class action. We find its extensive analysis\nto be instructive. The Armstrong court held correctly that even “a school desegregation\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363          Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.              Page 6\n\n\nplan devised through voluntary means . . . must attain a certain minimum level of\nconstitutional compliance.” Id. at 319 (citing Liddell v. Caldwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir.\n1976)). Consequently, when a proposed settlement is on the table,\n\n       [a] federal court cannot permit an agreement between counsel for the\n       defendants and counsel for the plaintiff class seriously to undercut the\n       constitutional policy requiring desegregation of our nation’s schools; this\n       is true even where the class members themselves do not oppose a\n       particular settlement. At the same time, however, the court cannot\n       disregard the desire of the litigants amicably to settle their litigation nor\n       can it ignore the substantial benefits which can accrue to both the class\n       members and the general public from a fair and adequate settlement of\n       a school desegregation controversy.\nArmstrong, 616 F.2d at 319.\n\n       Thus, the district court must delicately balance these competing interests before\ndeciding whether the proposed settlement is fair. The bottom line, as the Armstrong\ncourt explained, is that\n\n       no settlement [should] be approved which either initiates or authorizes\n       the continuation of clearly illegal conduct. A school desegregation\n       settlement which authorizes clearly unconstitutional behavior is, on its\n       face, neither fair, reasonable nor adequate as required by the class action\n       standard. In applying this principle, however, the court must not decide\n       unsettled legal questions; any illegality or unconstitutionality must\n       appear as a legal certainty on the face of the agreement before a\n       settlement can be rejected on this basis.\nId. at 319-20 (internal citations omitted).\n\n       Significantly, in assessing whether the settlement is fair, equitable, and\nreasonable, “the district court must not forget that it is reviewing a settlement proposal\nrather than ordering a remedy in a litigated case.” Id. at 314-15. Accordingly,\n“[b]ecause settlement of a class action, like settlement of any litigation, is basically a\nbargained for exchange between the litigants, the judiciary’s role is properly limited to\nthe minimum necessary to protect the interests of the class and the public. Judges\nshould not substitute their own judgment as to optimal settlement terms for the judgment\nof the litigants and their counsel.” Id. at 315 (emphasis added).\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.               Page 7\n\n\n        The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals echoed these sentiments in Little Rock Sch.\nDist., a case in which it reversed a district court’s rejection of a joint motion to settle the\nLittle Rock, Arkansas, school desegregation case:\n\n        The most important fact about the present appeals is that they arise out\n        of settlements agreed to by all parties in the District Court. We believe\n        the District Court erred by failing to give sufficient weight to that fact.\n        It treated the case almost as if it were a fully contested matter . . . . We\n        respectfully disagree with this approach. The law strongly favors\n        settlements. Courts should hospitably receive them. This may be\n        especially true in the present context – a protracted, highly divisive . . .\n        litigation, any lasting solution to which necessarily depends on the good\n        faith and cooperation of all the parties, especially the defendants. As a\n        practical matter, a remedy that everyone agrees to is a lot more likely to\n        succeed than one to which the defendants must be dragged kicking and\n        screaming.\n        This does not mean that a court must automatically approve anything the\n        parties set before it . . . . [T]his is a class action, and courts are not\n        obliged (indeed, they are not permitted) to approve settlements that are\n        unfair to class members, or negotiated by inadequate class\n        representatives.\n                                            ***\n        We are bound to respect this factual agreement by the parties. There is\n        no evidence in this record to contradict it, and we must believe that\n        counsel for the [] intervenors are the best defenders and guardians of the\n        interests of their own clients. This is, after all, no ordinary litigation.\n        The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, its lawyers and its\n        predecessors, have vigorously prosecuted this case and its ancestors for\n        more than 30 years. Absent an extremely good reason – and we have\n        been given none – we are reluctant to disregard their judgment as to\n        what is best for their own clients.\nLittle Rock Sch. Dist., 921 F.2d at 1383, 1386 (emphasis added).\n\n        We, too, endorse this approach, which “take[s] into account . . . the special\nconcerns implicit in [civil rights] class action settlements while still preserving the\nessential character of settlement of a lawsuit.” Armstrong, 616 F.2d at 315. Thus, while\nthe district court should not give “rubber stamp approval” in lieu of independent review\nto the parties’ joint unitary status motion, id., it must afford considerable weight to the\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v.

As we explain below, the\ndistrict court abused its discretion by not affording sufficient weight to the parties’ joint\nmotion and its factual basis.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363       Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 10\n\n\n                                A. Student Assignment\n\n       On the issue of student assignment, the district court found that the parties failed\nto satisfy an evidentiary burden imposed by the court:\n\n       Applying these principles to the case at hand, the Court finds that the\n       County is not presently in compliance with its constitutional obligations\n       with regard to student assignment. As explained supra, the racial\n       composition of the majority of the County schools is substantially\n       disproportionate to that of the district as a whole. The Board has made\n       no showing that racial balance is infeasible either generally or with\n       regard to certain schools. Furthermore, the record does not indicate that\n       the County has at any time accomplished its objectives; in fact, after\n       making considerable progress towards desegregation, the County has\n       seemingly drifted from any serious focus on desegregation.\n       While demographic factors, including those caused by annexation of\n       portions of the County by the City of Memphis, have clearly played a\n       part in creating the present racial composition of the County schools, the\n       County has not met its burden of showing that it would have achieved its\n       goal had it not been for these factors. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court\n       has articulated, the Board’s decisions with regard to school construction\n       and zoning have necessarily played an influential role in those\n       demographic shifts. Consequently, the Court must assume that the\n       remaining significant disparity in racial composition among the schools\n       is a product of past de jure segregation.\n(Footnote omitted; emphasis added.)\n\n       During the forty-five years of this litigation, the racial composition of the\nstudents attending the Shelby County Schools has fluctuated widely. Although the\nschool district’s overall student population and minority enrollment have grown rapidly,\nthe percentage of African-American students in the Shelby County Schools has varied\nsignificantly: 28 percent in 1969; 30 percent in 1971; 15 percent in 1984; 22 percent in\n2001; 32 percent in 2005; and 34 percent in 2007. The district court attributed much of\nthe racial ratio changes to annexations by the City of Memphis: “In 1984, the percentage\nof black students systemwide had dropped precipitously, apparently largely due to\nannexation into the City of Memphis of portions of the County . . . .” Further, at the\ndistrict court’s January 26, 2007, hearing, Assistant Board Superintendent Maura Black\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363              Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.                       Page 11\n\n\nSullivan testified that if the planned City of Memphis annexations are implemented,\nShelby County Schools’ African-American student ratio will decrease to 7.68 percent.\n\n         It is undisputed that political and social decisions beyond defendant Board’s\ncontrol have affected and continue to impact the racial ratio of the Shelby County\nstudents. These influences are not causally related to defendant’s violation of the\nConstitution and fall outside of the scope of the court’s equitable powers to restore the\nvictims of discrimination to the position they would have occupied absent the violation.\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971):\n\n         Neither school authorities nor district courts are constitutionally required\n         to make year-by-year adjustments of the racial compositions of student\n         bodies once the affirmative duty to desegregate has been accomplished\n         and racial discrimination through official action is eliminated from the\n         system . . . . [Therefore,] in the absence of a showing that either the\n         school authorities or some other agency of the State has deliberately\n         attempted to fix or alter demographic patterns to affect the racial\n         composition of the schools, further intervention by a district court should\n         not be necessary.\nId. at 31-32. As we further explained in Reed v. Rhodes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764702\"><a href=\"/opinion/764702/robert-a-reed-v-james-a-rhodes-cleveland-board-of-education-ohio-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1999):\n\n         That there was racial imbalance in student attendance zones was not\n         tantamount to a showing that the school district was in noncompliance\n         with the decree or with its duties under the law. Racial balance is not to\n         be achieved for its own sake. It is to be pursued when racial imbalance\n         has been caused by a constitutional violation. Once the racial imbalance\n         due to the de jure violation has been remedied, the school district is\n         under no duty to remedy imbalance that is caused by demographic\n         factors.\nId. at 466 (quoting Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494) (emphasis added).5\n\n         In granting unitary status in three of six areas, the district court “recognize[d] the\ngreat progress the Board has made in desegregating its schools.” Further, the court\n\n         5\n           In Reed, we affirmed the district court’s order holding that the Cleveland City School District\nwas entitled to a declaration of unitary status with respect to pupil assignments, where the district’s record\nof compliance stood as an unequivocal manifestation of good faith and “[t]he demographics of recent years\nhave reflected rapid population shifts within the city that were not caused by or attributable to the\nCleveland School District.” Reed, 179 F.3d at 467 (citation omitted).\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363          Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.          Page 12\n\n\nfound “no evidence that there has been racial discrimination by the County in the areas\nof facilities, transportation or staffing during the last few decades of this case.”\nAlthough the district judge acknowledged at a status conference that de jure racial\ndiscrimination no longer exists in the school district, she nonetheless continued federal\ncourt supervision of student assignment because, in her opinion, the racial ratio in\nindividual schools was “uneven.” The district judge cited the school district’s new state-\nof-the-art Southwind High School as an example of such unevenness; Southwind was\nexpected to open in the fall of 2007 with an African-American student population of\napproximately 88 percent.\n\n          In determining whether the present racial “unevenness” is properly subject to the\ncourt’s equitable remedies, we must decide if the current conditions are vestiges of the\nprior unconstitutional de jure system or the products of other actions or conditions.\nReed, 179 F.3d at 466. Following oral argument and our review of the record and briefs,\nwe conclude that the lower court clearly erred in finding the former, rather than the\nlatter.\n\n          In the past decades, the vestiges of the racially segregated Shelby School system\nhave been dismantled. A new “unitary, nonracial system of public education,” Green,\n391 U.S. at 436, has risen in its place for which the parties are justifiably proud. The\nrecord reveals that the racial “unevenness” that currently exists in individual schools is\nnot the product of defendant’s forty-five- year-old constitutional violation. Rather, with\nthe passage of time and court intervention, other dynamics have now shaped the district\ninto its current form. The annexations by the City of Memphis, along with voluntary\nhousing choices made by the public, have drastically altered the racial composition of\nthe school district. In addition, school construction and student boundaries (including\nthe new Southwind High School) approved by the district court over the past few\ndecades have affected the present racial unevenness. Although the district court now\nfaults itself for “rubber-stamp[ing]” school construction and zoning requests (JA 116),\nits role in managing and shaping the school district cannot be ignored.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.              Page 13\n\n\n        Finally, the Supreme Court requires that we consider “whether the school district\nhas demonstrated, to the public and to the parents and students of the once disfavored\nrace, its good-faith commitment to the whole of the court’s decree and to those\nprovisions of the law and the Constitution that were the predicate for judicial\nintervention in the first instance.” Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491.\n\n        On this issue, we are greatly influenced by the position of plaintiffs. The\nplaintiffs fought this battle to desegregate the Shelby County Schools. They are the\nstudents, and now parents or grandparents, who suffered from the constitutional\nviolation. In their view, the battle has been won. They now ask that we declare the\nschool district to be a unitary, nonracial system of public education. We afford great\nweight to the appraisal of the most interested parties to this litigation, particularly where\nthe record illustrates defendant’s compliance with the desegregation order through the\ncreation of remedial programs targeting racial inequities and the construction of state-of-\nthe-art facilities. See Reed, 179 F.3d at 466-67 (citing the school district’s initiatives\n“designed to develop self-esteem and enhance the academic potential of all students\nregardless of race” and other corrective measures taken in African American schools “to\ninvolve parents and offset negative socioeconomic factors” as evidence of the district’s\ngood-faith efforts to desegregate the school system).            Under the circumstances,\ndefendant has satisfactorily complied with the student assignment portion of the\ndesegregation decree and therefore is entitled to a declaration of unitary status with\nrespect to this component.\n\n                                  B. Faculty Integration\n\n        For the reasons previously stated, and those recited below, we also hold that the\ndistrict court clearly erred in rejecting unitary status as it pertains to faculty integration.\n\n        In this regard, the district court found that defendant Board was likewise “not in\nfull compliance” with the law because the African-American teacher ratio varied in\nindividual schools from five percent to thirty percent. In “hindsight,” the court\nacknowledged that its prior “focus on this aspect was ill-conceived.” Although noting\nthat “a school desegregation plan is not an affirmative action program for teachers,” the\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 14\n\n\ncourt reversed its previous approach by directing that the racial ratio of the faculty match\nthe racial composition of the student population as a whole:\n\n        On this ground, the Court finds that, rather than tying the racial\n        composition of a school’s faculty to that of the population of teachers in\n        the system as [a] whole, it should be linked instead to the racial\n        composition of the student population. Accordingly, the Court finds it\n        necessary to depart from its prior directives and concludes that the\n        County’s constitutional obligations require the achievement of a racial\n        balance reflective of the systemwide student population, within a margin\n        of error to be enumerated below and subject to mitigating circumstances\n        and a feasibility requirement, as developed supra.\n(Footnote omitted; first emphasis in original, second emphasis added.)\n\n        The intervenor United States appeals this remedy arguing that it is unprecedented\nand would result in a “bizarre” and “racially discriminatory hiring and firing” of teachers\nto keep pace with the ever-changing racial dynamics of the student population.\n\n        At the hearing of January 26, 2007, Assistant Superintendent of Human\nResources Lois Williams, who is African-American, testified about the Board’s\nextensive efforts to recruit minority teachers. Ms. Williams testified that under the\nsupervision of minority recruiter Eddy Jones, who is also African-American, the Board,\nduring 2005-2006, visited over fifty-five colleges and universities, including “13\nhistorically black colleges and universities in an effort to recruit minority candidates for\nteaching positions in the Shelby County Schools.”\n\n        When asked if her decision-making would change if the case were dismissed, Ms.\nWilliams responded:\n\n        Q.      [Mr. Winchester] Okay. And you understand that we’re asking\n                the court to dismiss the Robinson case and – and be free from\n                judicial court scrutiny of our recruiting and hiring practices:\n        A.      [Ms. Williams] I do understand that, sir.\n        Q.

Race-based hiring of the sort ordered by the district court\nviolates the Constitution.\n\n        Moreover, we agree with the United States that the district court’s assertion that\neach child is constitutionally entitled to “educational guidance which includes teachers\nof the student’s own race” is invalid.

The district court’s ruling in the instant case directly\ncontradicts this principle.\n\n       Finally, as previously discussed supra, the record clearly shows that the racial\ndisparity ratio from school to school for teachers is not the product of a constitutional\nviolation, but of other demographic trends. Therefore, the vestiges of the post-\nconstitutional violation regarding faculty integration have not been demonstrated. In\nlight of the abundant evidence of the Board’s good faith efforts to recruit and hire\nminority faculty despite a state-wide minority teacher shortage, the district court abused\nits discretion in failing to afford greater weight to the factual basis submitted by the\nparties on this issue and in denying their joint motion.\n\n                              C. Extracurricular Activities\n\n       The district court also denied the parties’ joint motion for unitary status regarding\nextracurricular activities. The only explanation for this ruling is the following footnote:\n“The Court determined that the issue of extra-curricular activities requires further\ninquiry before declaring unitary status as to that area.”\n\n       We conclude that the district court clearly erred by rejecting, without\nexplanation, the joint motion of the parties. “[T]he district court must clearly set forth\nin the record its reasons for approving [or rejecting] the settlement in order to make\nmeaningful appellate review possible. This is particularly important in civil rights class\nactions.” Armstrong, 616 F.2d at 315 (citations omitted).

MARBLEY, District Judge, dissenting. In reversing the district\ncourt’s carefully considered judgment denying unitary status to the Shelby County\nSchools on the subjects of student desegregation, faculty desegregation, and\nextracurricular activities, the majority’s reasoning comes to this: the parties have jointly\nstipulated to dismissal and such compromises should be encouraged by the courts,\nespecially in the divisive realm of school desegregation.\n\n        I have no particular quarrel with this general principle, but I do not believe that\nthe virtues of compromise can compensate for the lack of evidence substantiating that\nthe County has in fact eliminated, to the extent practicable, all remaining vestiges of\nunlawful discrimination. Nothing—not the agreement of the parties jointly to seek\ndissolution of the desegregation decree, not the number of years that this case has been\npending and the general progress in race relations nationwide that has occurred in that\ntime, and not the eagerness of the courts or school boards to restore local control over\ncommunity schools—can substitute for evidence showing the Board’s compliance with\nthe desegregation decree. The evidence in fact reveals that among the forty-four schools\nfor which the Board has data, two thirds of them are not in compliance with the flexible\nbenchmark set forth by the district court for measuring racial balance. Furthermore, the\ndistrict court has been managing this case since 1963. Based on the court’s knowledge\nand experience with this case, it is in the best position to judge the evidence and\ndetermine whether dissolution of the desegregation decree is appropriate at this time.\nBecause the parties have not carried their burden of showing that the racial disparities\nthat continue to plague the County’s schools are not the vestiges of past unlawful\ndiscrimination, I would affirm the district court’s judgment.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v.

The History of Desegregation in Shelby County\n\n       The majority opinion does not recount the history of this lengthy and complicated\ncase. Because I believe that we must consider the entire record to evaluate properly the\ndistrict court’s judgment, I set forth the most important facts of the case below.\n\n                                      1. 1963-1971\n\n       The years between 1963 and 1971 were by far the most active in the case’s\nhistory. This period was marked by the County’s early intransigence in adopting\nappropriate measures to de-segregate its schools, the intervention of the Department of\nJustice (the “Government”) to pressure the County to take its desegregation obligations\nseriously, and ultimately, in 1971, the district court’s approval (following a reversal and\nremand by this Court) of a comprehensive plan to eliminate the racial identifiability of\nall the County’s schools.\n\n       On June 12, 1963, nine years after Brown v. Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1954) was decided, twenty-one public-school students brought this class action against\nthe Shelby County Board of Education (the “Board”) seeking a declaratory injunction\nthat the public schools were unconstitutionally segregated and an injunction requiring\nthe Board to integrate them. (Joint Appendix (“JA”) 156.) In response to the Plaintiffs’\ncomplaint, the Board denied any wrongdoing, but nonetheless submitted a plan to the\ndistrict court, which approved it on March 17, 1964. (JA 156-160.)\n\n       This first effort amounted to no more than a “freedom-of-choice” plan, and it\nbarely qualified as that. “Freedom-of-choice” plans purported to put an end to\nsegregated schools by permitting African-American students voluntarily to choose to\nattend the all-white schools from which they had long been excluded. The Board’s plan,\nhowever, erected numerous obstacles to exercising free choice. It conditioned the\ntransfer of African-American students into white schools on a showing of good behavior,\nacceptable academic performance, sufficient family income, and psychological stability.\n(JA 158.)\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.             Page 21\n\n\n        In 1966, two years after the district court approved the Board’s freedom-of-\nchoice plan, the Government intervened in the case. (JA 160.) In response to a\nGovernment motion criticizing the Board for lack of progress in desegregating its\nschools, the district court entered an order making minor modifications to the decree, but\nthese changes still did not promise to make the mandate of Brown a reality. (JA 162-63.)\nBy 1967, four years after the Plaintiffs filed suit, and thirteen years after Brown, 100\npercent of white students attended the formerly all-white schools and 98.7 percent of\nAfrican-American students attended the formerly all-black schools. (JA 165.)\n\n        On January 19, 1967, in response to another Government motion contending that\nthe Board was shirking its desegregation obligations, the district court again modified\nthe decree. (JA 284.) The district court tinkered with the plan to make it slightly easier\nfor African-American students to transfer to the formerly all-white schools, but the\nanemic “freedom-of-choice” approach still ruled the day. Although continuing to fall\nshort in terms of desegregating the student bodies of the Shelby County Schools, the\ndistrict court’s January 19, 1967 order was notable because for the first time it spelled\nout precise benchmarks for desegregating the County’s faculties. (JA 284.) The court\nheld that a faculty would be regarded as desegregated when its racial composition\nreflected the County-wide composition within a deviation of ten percentage points. (JA\n286.) To that end, the court ordered the Board to fill all faculty vacancies with teachers\nwhose race was under-represented in the school at issue. (JA 286.) In addition, the\ndistrict court ordered the Board to implement a program to recruit white teachers to work\nin schools whose faculties were predominantly African-American and African-American\nteachers to work in schools with predominantly white faculties. (JA 287.)\n\n        To measure the Board’s compliance with these requirements, the district court\nordered it to file certain reports on a regular basis. First, before filling a faculty vacancy\nwith a teacher of the over-represented race, the Board was required to notify the Court\nof its intention to do so, as well as explain its efforts to transfer or hire a teacher of the\nunder-represented race and why those efforts failed. (JA 288-89.) In its July 26, 2007\norder declining to dissolve the desegregation decree, the district court found that\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363             Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.       Page 22\n\n\nthroughout this litigation, the Board has never once filed this report before\ntransferring/hiring a teacher of the over-represented race to fill a vacancy.1\n\n        Second, the Board was instructed to submit, on August 1 of each year, a report\nproviding data on the racial make-up of the faculty in each school, as well as the number\nof vacancies that were filled by faculty of the over-represented race. (JA 289.) The\nAugust 1 report was to be supplemented on October 1 of each year. (JA 289.)\n\n        On August 1, 1967, the Board submitted its first annual report on teacher\ndesegregation. This report showed that the Board employed 1500 teachers. Pursuant\nto the district court’s order that the Board re-assign teachers of the opposite race “in all\ncases in which the transfer can be accomplished without seriously impairing the\neducational program,” (JA 287), the Board reported that it had re-assigned just 128\nteachers, or 8.5 percent of the total number. The Board’s October supplement showed\nthat of the 200 vacancies filled for the upcoming school year, only twelve of these were\nfilled by teachers of the under-represented race.\n\n        On May 27, 1968, the Supreme Court decided Green v. County School Board of\nNew Kent County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968). There, the Court held that “freedom-of-choice”\nplans were generally inadequate to satisfy the mandate of Brown. Leaving no doubt\nabout the gravity of the responsibility facing local school boards, the Green Court stated,\n“The burden on a school board today is to come forward with a plan that promises\nrealistically to work, and promises realistically to work now.” Id. at 439. School boards\nwere instructed to take whatever remedial steps were required to eliminate racial\ndiscrimination “root and branch.” Id. at 438.\n\n        The district court issued another order on July 17, 1968, clarifying the Board’s\ndesegregation responsibilities in light of Green. (JA 171.) As to faculty desegregation,\nthe court reiterated that the ratio of African-American to white teachers in each school\nwas to reflect the County-wide ratio within a margin of ten percentage points. The court\nheld that this ratio had to be satisfied in the County’s elementary schools (defined as\n\n\n        1\n            The Board does not dispute this finding.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.           Page 23\n\n\ngrades one through six) by the start of the 1968-69 school year and that it was to be met\nin the remainder of the County’s schools by the start of the 1969-70 school year. (JA\n172.) The court further ordered the Board to prepare a new desegregation plan designed\nto accomplish these goals and otherwise eliminate the racial identifiability of the\nCounty’s schools. (JA 172.)\n\n       On August 15, 1968, the district court provided additional guidance about the\npreparation of the Board’s new desegregation plan. (JA 173.) For the first time, the\ndistrict court set a benchmark for desegregating the County’s student bodies. The court\nruled that insofar as feasible, the Board should assign students so that the ratio of\nAfrican-American to white students in each school reflected the County-wide ratio,\nwithin a margin of ten percentage points. (JA 173.)\n\n       The Board submitted its post-Green plan for the district court’s review on\nJanuary 15, 1969. This plan did not come anywhere close to achieving the student racial\nbalance that the district court had ordered. (JA 175.) The Board admitted that its plan\ndid not require the desegregation of high school students, but instead permitted them to\nremain in the high schools that they were already attending. (JA 175.) As to faculty\ndesegregation, the Board sought relief from the obligation of achieving any particular\nracial ratio among high school teachers, let alone that specified by the district court (a\nblack-to-white ratio in each school that reflected the ratio in the County as a whole, plus\nor minus ten percentage points). (JA 174.) The Board argued that the work of\ndesegregating high school faculties was made more difficult by the fact that these\nteachers were licensed in particular subject areas.\n\n       The Plaintiffs and the Government opposed the Board’s post-Green plan as\ninadequate. (JA 175-78.) The district court nonetheless approved it.\n\n       On April 6, 1970, the district court approved certain modifications to the Board’s\ndesegregation plan. See Robinson v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2127098\"><a href=\"/opinion/2127098/robinson-by-robinson-v-shelby-county-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104-\n05 (W.D. Tenn. 1970). Importantly, the court backed away from its earlier insistence\nthat the County achieve a student racial composition within each school that reflected\nthe County racial composition within ten percentage points. Rather, the court held that\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 24\n\n\nthe Board was not required to achieve any particular degree of racial balance among its\nstudents and that the most that could be asked was for the Board to “honestly draw[]\nunitary geographical zone lines, that is, zones not gerrymandered to preserve segregation\n. . . .” Id. at 102. The court stood by its prior pronouncements with respect to faculty\ndesegregation but added the caveat that efforts to de-segregate high school teachers\nshould be tempered by considerations of their qualifications. The court stated, “to the\nextent feasible, in the light of the qualifications of the teachers and the need for teachers\nof particular qualifications in the [secondary] school, such teachers will be assigned and\ntransferred so that the ratio of white to Negro teachers in each school will be, within a\ntolerance of 10%, the same as in the system as a whole.” Id. at 105.\n\n        On appeal of the district court’s April 6, 1970 order, this Court remanded the\ncase for further consideration of the County’s desegregation obligations.

Shelby County Bd. of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"296477\"><a href=\"/opinion/296477/claude-bernard-robinson-and-julia-d-robinson-infants-by-melvin-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 (6th Cir. 1971).

This plan was largely that advanced\nby the Board, but the district court also accepted certain suggestions from the Title IV\nCenter at the University of Tennessee, as well as the Government. Id. at 843. This latest\neffort apparently dealt exclusively with student desegregation. Id.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 25\n\n\n                                      2. 1971-2006\n\n        The Board’s 1971 desegregation plan approved by the district court marked the\nlast substantial revision to the Board’s desegregation efforts in the history of this case.\nIt was also virtually the last time that either the Plaintiffs or the Government challenged\nany of the Board’s decisions as contrary to its desegregation obligations, or argued that\nthe Board was not complying with the plan’s requirements. Perhaps due in large part to\nthe lack of adversarial litigation, the record is rather thin on evidence showing what\nprogress, if any, the Board made toward dismantling the vestiges of unlawful\ndiscrimination in its schools. It appears that neither the Plaintiffs, the Government, nor\nthe district court required much in the way of statistical data tracking the racial\ncomposition of the County’s students and faculty over time.\n\n        To begin with, very little can be gleaned from the record about what was\nhappening with student desegregation. There is almost no evidence documenting the\nracial composition of each school from year to year (and comparing that to the County-\nwide ratio), the indicators the Board used, if any, to gauge its progress, the obstacles the\nBoard confronted, or how it made decisions in operating the County’s schools to ensure\nits full compliance with the desegregation decree. The definition of “success” and the\nBoard’s path to arrive there are not clear. For instance, between August 20, 1974 and\nAugust 3, 2004, the district court entered more than fifty consent orders modifying the\ndecree as to such things as school-attendance zones and new-school construction. (JA\n192-234.) It appears that the Board rarely provided information about the impact these\nmodifications would have on the student racial composition of each of the schools. The\nrecord suggests that the Board often did no more than conclusorily state that the changes\nwere not expected to have any deleterious effects on the desegregation plan. (See, e.g.,\nJA 219-26.)\n\n        Moreover, Plaintiffs rarely interposed any objections to the Board’s plans and the\nsame was true of the Government. On one of the few occasions that serious opposition\nto the Board’s plans was lodged, the district court found that the Board had allowed\nimproper considerations to trump its desegregation duties. The dispute centered on the\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.             Page 26\n\n\nBoard’s desire in 1985 to add ten new classrooms to an overwhelmingly white\nelementary school to alleviate over-crowding. (JA 203.) The Government opposed the\nconstruction project (it does not appear that the Plaintiffs joined the Government),\nclaiming that the Board impermissibly wanted to avoid utilizing the excess capacity of\nnearby elementary schools with significant African-American populations. (JA 203-04.)\nOn April 8, 1986, the district court denied the Board’s petition to build the extra\nclassrooms. (JA 209.) The court agreed with the Government that the Board had failed\nto give due consideration to its desegregation obligations, and that it had elevated\n“community pride” (meaning the community pride of the white elementary school\nstudents and parents) in preserving present enrollment at the over-crowded elementary\nschool over its duty to eliminate unlawful discrimination. (JA 209-10.)\n\n       The record regarding faculty desegregation between 1971 and 2006 is only\nslightly more robust. After the Board’s initial report on August 1, 1967, the record is\nsilent about the Board’s efforts to re-assign teachers. As noted above, the Board\nreported that it had re-assigned 8.5 percent of its teachers, effective during the 1967-68\nschool year. The record does not disclose whether the Board undertook any more re-\nassignment efforts after 1967. Certainly, the Board does not state in its briefing to this\nCourt that it did so, nor does it point to any evidence of such. Thus, it appears that in\nresponse to the district court’s January 19, 1967 order, the Board had done all the faculty\nre-assigning it intended to do by August 1, 1967.\n\n       With respect to teacher transfers to fill vacancies, the district court had instructed\nthe Board to file annual reports showing the number of openings filled by teachers of the\nover-represented and under-represented race. Between 1974 and 1979, the Board’s\nreports show that half the time, a majority of vacancies were not filled by teachers of\nthe under-represented race (as ordered by the district court). (JA 133; 194-95; 198-201.)\nIt appears that the Board stopped reporting this statistic altogether by 1981. Neither the\nPlaintiffs, the Government, nor the district court seems to have taken issue with the\nBoard’s abandonment of this requirement. In addition, although the Board was supposed\nto notify the court before filling a vacancy with a teacher of the over-represented race\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.          Page 27\n\n\nand justify its inability to employ an opposite-race teacher, the record is bereft of any\nevidence that the Board ever did so, and the Board does not dispute that it did not.\n\n       Besides the Board’s lackluster track record as to faculty re-assignment and\nvacancies, the record discloses another deeply disturbing trend. Between 1974 and\n2006, the total percentage of African-American faculty at the County’s schools declined\nmarkedly. The Board’s 1974 annual report showed that thirty-three percent of the\nCounty’s faculty were African-American, which correlates closely to the fact that around\nthis same period, thirty percent of the County’s students were African-American. In\n2006, only fifteen percent of the County’s faculty were African-American, even though\naround this same period, a significantly higher percentage, thirty-four percent, of the\nCounty’s students were African-American.\n\n       In August 1989, the district court was so disturbed by the decline in the Board’s\nemployment of African-American teachers that it asked the parties to address the\nquestion of whether the Board’s reports “for the reporting period of August 1, 1985, to\nAugust 1, 1989, indicate an employment practice or policy within the Shelby County\nSchools which achieves a gradual but definite decline in the number of black teachers\nemployed by the school system.” (JA 214.) The Board responded that the problem was\nattributable to fewer African-American people becoming teachers. (JA 214.) The\nGovernment had a different position, noting that between 1972 and 1989, the number of\nwhite teachers had more than doubled, but the number of African-American teachers had\nremained virtually the same, that the Board had “recruited almost 10 times as many\nwhite applicants as black applicants,” and that its offer rate for white candidates was\nmuch higher than for African-American candidates. (JA 215.) The Government also\ncited statistics showing that the Memphis City Schools (located within Shelby County,\nbut not part of the Shelby County school system) did a much better job of recruiting\nAfrican-American applicants, even though the starting salary for teachers in Memphis\nwas slightly less than that offered by the Board. (JA 215-16.) The Government also\nargued that the Board was much less proactive than it could have been in its outreach to\ncolleges and universities, particularly to historically African-American colleges. (JA\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.          Page 28\n\n\n216.) On July 3, 1990, the district court ordered the Board to submit supplemental\nannual reports regarding its minority recruiting practices. (JA 218.)\n\n       The Board filed regular supplemental reports on minority recruiting between\n1990 and 2006. These reports both confirm that the Board expanded its outreach to\ncolleges and universities, including historically African-American colleges, and provide\ndata on the offer rates for African-American and white candidates. In the early years,\noffer rates for African-American candidates sometimes exceeded those for white\ncandidates; but by 1997, offers to white candidates always outpaced offers to African-\nAmerican candidates, sometimes significantly. See, e.g., JA 228 (October 1999 report\nshowing that twenty-six percent of African-American applicants interviewed through the\ncentral office were given offers, compared to fifty-one percent of white applicants).\n\n       Thus, the extent of the Board’s compliance with the desegregation decree\nbetween 1971 and 2006 is difficult to assess. During that time, the Plaintiffs never\nchallenged any of the Board’s decisions. Similarly, the Board did not apprise the court\n(and the court apparently did not inquire) of any factors that impeded its progress\ndesegregating as much as practicable or any steps it took to alleviate those impediments.\nThe Board did not even bother to submit the required reports on faculty desegregation.\nWhether the racial disparities that continue to mark the Shelby County Schools are due\nto reasons wholly unrelated to the ongoing effects of unlawful discrimination, as the\nmajority contends, or whether the Board could and should have done more to attain its\ndesegregation objectives, are not answered by the record as it existed at the time the\nparties moved for dissolution of the decree. Moreover, as described below, the parties\ndid not fill this evidentiary gap at the two hearings conducted by the district court to\nconsider their motion.\n\n             3. The Joint Motion to Dissolve the Desegregation Decree\n\n       On August 14, 2006, the Plaintiffs and the Board jointly moved for an order\ndissolving the desegregation decree and declaring the public schools “unitary.” The\nparties asserted that they had fully complied with the decree and that they had met the\nstandards articulated by the Supreme Court for eliminating the effects of past de jure\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.           Page 29\n\n\nsegregation. Despite the joint nature of the application, the district court recognized that\nit “ha[d] an obligation to independently evaluate these factors and the evidence to assure\nthat the system as it exist[s] now is truly unitary and color blind.” (JA 1187.) The court\ntherefore held evidentiary hearings on January 26, 2007 and July 23, 2007.\n\n        The two hearings consisted largely of anecdotal testimony by school officials and\nparents. For example, Superintendent Bobby G. Webb testified that his staff worked\ndiligently to adjust school attendance zones to make sure that the County has “good\ncommunity-based schools and have them as diverse as we possibly can.” (JA 1204.) He\nstated, “I can tell you without a doubt that—that all of the staff that I have to work with\n. . . certainly love and respect every child regardless of their color, background or\nwhatever . . . .” (JA 1205.) When asked by the district court what evidence it should\nconsider in determining whether the Board’s efforts to promote color blindness will\ncontinue in the absence of court monitoring, Webb responded: “I personally can assure\nyou that as long as I’m superintendent there will be no discrimination in any shape, form,\nor fashion.” (JA 1230.)\n\n        Assistant Superintendent of Planning and Student Service Maura Sullivan\ntestified that she had worked closely with Plaintiffs’ counsel over the years to adjust\nattendance zones based on enrollment projections and assess the impact of the\nadjustments on school demographics. (JA 1239-40.) Assistant Superintendent Lois\nWilliams described the County’s efforts to recruit minority teachers. She identified the\nbiggest barrier to minority-teacher recruitment as the shrinking teaching pool overall and\nthe shortage among minority candidates in particular. (JA 1315.) The Board’s goal,\naccording to Williams, is for fourteen percent of the teachers in each of the County’s\nschools to be minorities. (JA 1302.)\n\n        During the July 23, 2007 hearing, the Plaintiffs and the Board called two parents\nto testify. The first, Ricky Jeans, had himself been a student in the Shelby County\nSchools in the late 1960s and had been one of the first African-American students to\nattend a formerly all-white school. (JA 1378-79.) Jeans testified in favor of dissolving\nthe desegregation decree, stating, “I think that it’s time that we—we look backwards and\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.             Page 30\n\n\nsee where we started at and look at the improvement of the system and what has gone\non down through the years and support maybe dropping the system from this point on,\nbut I am a big advocate of the Shelby County school system.” (JA 1379.) The second,\nBrenda Gipson, testified that the Shelby County Schools had become more diverse both\nin their student bodies and faculties since she had been involved with them through her\nchildren. Gipson testified that school administrators are “for an environment of\ninclusiveness—inclusiveness, they go out of their way to make sure that everyone feels\nimportant in the school system.” (JA 1387.) Finally, Gipson testified that some schools\nin the County have a largely African-American student body but that “obviously most\nof the ones in my area are predominantly white.” (JA 1388.)\n\n        The evidence presented at the two hearings was thus largely anecdotal and based\non the personal views of the interested parties and two parents. Neither the Board nor\nPlaintiffs put any school-desegregation experts on the stand to testify about the Board’s\nperformance since the desegregation decree was imposed. Neither party put any\nwitnesses on the stand to opine that the Board had achieved desegregation to the extent\nfeasible or that it had availed itself of all opportunities to desegregate. Finally, there was\nno expert testimony about demographic changes in the County or about how such\nchanges should be interpreted in light of the fact that the Board had formerly practiced\nde jure segregation.\n\n                             B. The District Court’s Order\n\n        On July 26, 2007, the district court issued a sixty-two page opinion,\nsupplemented by a one-hundred-and-sixteen page “Procedural Appendix” of the case.\nThe district court granted the parties’ joint motion as to facilities, transportation, and\nstaffing, finding that there was no evidence that the Board had been discriminatory over\nthe last few decades in managing these aspects of the schools. (JA 115.) A declaration\nof unitary status was therefore found to be appropriate as to these three areas. The court,\nhowever, denied the joint motion as to student assignment, faculty assignment, and\nextracurricular activities and held that the court would continue to supervise these areas.\n(JA 116.)\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.           Page 31\n\n\n                                 1. Student Assignment\n\n       The district court found that by 1971, the Board had begun to make real progress\ntoward desegregating the student bodies of its schools. (JA 106.) Still, “at least a\nquarter of the schools remained outside the target racial composition range established\nby the [court].” (JA 107.) The court also noted that by 1984, the proportion of African-\nAmerican students in each school continued to be “uneven,” with three schools out of\nthirty-four having fewer than five percent African-American students and three having\nbetween fifty and seventy percent. (JA 108.) These disparities have only widened. The\ndistrict court found that by the 2004-05 school year, only seventeen of the County’s\nforty-six schools had a racial make-up that reflected, within ten percentage points, the\nracial make-up of the County as a whole. (JA 108.) Moreover, the County’s new “state-\nof-the-art” high school is expected to have an eighty-eight percent or higher African-\nAmerican student population. (JA 108.)\n\n       The district court concluded that “[t]he Board has made no showing that racial\nbalance is infeasible either generally or with regard to certain schools.” (JA 111.) The\ncourt further found that “the record does not indicate that the County has at any time\naccomplished its objectives . . . .” (JA 111.) The racial compositions of the student\nbodies of the individual schools relative to the County as a whole are important,\nreasoned the court, because such concrete and detailed statistics enable a court to gauge\nprogress towards eliminating the “racial identifiability” of schools, which is the key to\nachieving unitary status. Without a statistical comparison, the court said it would be left\nto “rely on anecdotal evidence, gut feelings, and assurances from defendants that they\n‘love and respect every child regardless of their color—hardly a proper basis for making\nmomentous legal decisions.” (JA 110.) At the same time, the court recognized that\n“racial balance is not a strict requirement and there may be mitigating circumstances\nwhich would allow a school system to operate one or more schools with a predominance\nof one race or another without running afoul of its equal protection obligations . . . .”\n(JA 109.)\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.           Page 32\n\n\n       With these principles in mind, the district court directed the Board to work\ntoward achieving racial balance in all its schools, which it defined as a student racial\ncomposition in each school that mirrors the County-wide ratio within a margin of fifteen\npercentage points. (JA 117.) The court characterized this benchmark as a “flexible\ngoal” and “a starting point in analyzing the Board’s success in desegregation.” (JA 117.)\n\n                                 2. Faculty Assignment\n\n       The district court declined to grant unitary status as to faculty assignment,\nfinding that the Board had not exhibited good-faith compliance with the court’s prior\ndesegregation orders. (JA 102-03.) The court found it “somewhat astonishing” that the\nBoard reassigned only 128 teachers out of 1500 in response to the order directing that\nthis be done “in all cases” provided that the educational program was not seriously\nimpaired. (JA 103.) The court was also troubled by the lack of full compliance with the\nrequirements for transferring teachers when vacancies arose.           The district court\nconcluded that\n\n       Strict compliance with the new faculty integration requirement would\n       have almost surely effected a very rapid transition to a system where the\n       faculty at each school was reflective of the systemwide racial\n       composition. This seems apparent because practically any vacancy at a\n       school whose faculty was racially disproportionate would have set off a\n       chain of intra-system transfers which would only stop when either\n       complete racial balance was achieved or a vacancy resulted which was\n       impossible to fill from within the system.\n(JA 102.) Finally, the district court observed that the Board had “utter[ly] disregard[ed]”\nthe requirement that it notify the court before filling a faculty opening with a teacher of\nthe over-represented race. (JA 103.) The district court concluded that the wide gulf\nbetween the proportion of African-American teachers at various schools in the County\ntoday, ranging from a low of five percent to a high of thirty percent, showed that the\nBoard’s efforts were wanting. (JA 112.)\n\n       When it came to fashioning a remedy, the court disavowed its earlier approach\nof aiming to have a percentage of African-American teachers in each school that\nmirrored the percentage of African-American teachers in the County. (JA 113.) This\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.          Page 33\n\n\napproach, said the court, “created the perverse incentive to allow the overall black\nfaculty representation to slip . . . .” (JA 113.) The court feared that the Board could\nreduce the County-wide percentage of African-American teachers by terminating\nAfrican-American teachers. As the County-wide percentage fell, so too could the\npercentage required in each school, without raising the specter of any disparity between\nthe two. (JA 113.)\n\n       Having identified what it deemed to be a fatal flaw with its longstanding method\nof measuring progress toward faculty desegregation, the district court came up with\nanother method. It ruled that, henceforth, the proper comparison would be between the\npercentage of African-American teachers in a school and the percentage of African-\nAmerican students in the County. (JA 114.) Thus, since the County’s African-American\nstudent population stood at thirty-four percent in 2007, each school should endeavor to\nachieve that proportion of African-American teachers. The district court ruled that this\napproach was consistent with ensuring that African-American students were not\n“isolated” in their educational experience as a result of too few African-American\nteachers in their classrooms. (JA 114.) The court stated that “if a black child is allowed\nto attend a previously all-white school, but is denied educational guidance which\nincludes teachers of the student’s own race, the student is unacceptably isolated and\ndeprived of a full educational experience.” (JA 114.) The Court concluded that a\nconcern about the possible “isolation” of African-American students was an\n“unarticulated principle that . . . animates the Supreme Court’s emphasis on the\nimportance of a diverse faculty.” (JA 114.) Thus, the district court ordered the Board\nto work toward a faculty racial balance that would mirror the proportion of African-\nAmerican students in the County as a whole, within a margin of fifteen percentage\npoints. Just as with the student-assignment goal, the court treated this faculty goal as\n“flexible” and “a starting point in analyzing the Board’s success . . . .” (JA 117.)\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363           Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.                  Page 34\n\n\n                                 3. Extracurricular Activities\n\n        The district court also declined to grant unitary status with respect to the Board’s\nsponsorship of student extracurricular activities, but the district court did not separately\nexplain this decision.2\n\n        Following the January hearing, the district court asked the Board to submit\nadditional statistical data relating to several different aspects of the County schools. One\nof the things the Court requested was “demographic data on students participating in all\nextracurricular activities.” (JA 479.) The Board admitted that it has not typically\nmaintained records tracking this type of information. Owing to a similar request by the\nTennessee Board of Education, however, the Board compiled what information it could,\nwhich turned out to be a chart showing the percentage of African-American and white\nstudents in thirty out of the County’s forty-eight schools that participate in\nextracurricular activities. (JA 486.) Thus, data for eighteen schools was completely\nomitted. Moreover, the chart provides only the students’ participation rate by race; it\ndoes not explain what the Board or individual schools deem to be extracurricular\nactivities, or African-American and white students’ participation rates within specific\nactivities.\n\n                       4. Other Aspects of the District Court’s Order\n\n        The district court acknowledged that its management of the case had not been\noptimally tailored to helping the Board achieve unitary status. The court said that its\n“failure to adopt clear and unequivocal guidelines for achievement of the [c]ourt’s goals\nis in large part responsible for the fact that the County is seeking unitary status some\nforty-four years after this suit was first filed . . . .” (JA 116.) Pointing to the fact that the\nPlaintiffs and the County had been in “lock step” with one another for much of the last\nthirty years and that there had been “few, if any, contested issues, and only nominal\nlitigation,” the district court acknowledged the need for it to take a more hands-on\n\n\n        2\n           The Board presented minimal evidence on this subject, which may explain the absence of the\ndistrict court’s explanation on its decision.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 35\n\n\napproach to supervising the litigation with an eye to bringing it to a conclusion in the\nnear future. The court stated that it had “largely served to ‘rubber-stamp’ the County’s\nunopposed construction and zoning requests with little or no meaningful review of how\nsuch proposals contributed to or detracted from the County’s overall progress toward\nunitary status . . . . The joint motion to dismiss compels the [c]ourt to resume a more\nsubstantive role in bringing the County school system’s desegregation process to a\nlegitimate closure.” (JA 115-16.)\n\n        Besides the “flexible” benchmarks the district court set for evaluating the\nBoard’s student and faculty desegregation efforts, the district court also set timetables\nfor achieving them. The court set October 2012 as the target date for full compliance.\n(JA 119.) After three years of full compliance, the court said it would dissolve the\ndesegregation decree. (JA 119.)\n\n        Next, the district court ordered the Board to submit data annually concerning the\nracial composition of each school’s students and teachers. The Board was further\ninstructed to provide information about “mitigating factors, including infeasibility of\nfurther desegregation and shifting demographics, as appropriate.” (JA 118.) The Board\nwas to continue submitting notices of school construction plans and attendance-zone\nmodifications to the court until the desegregation decree was dissolved. Contrary to the\nperfunctory nature of similar reports filed in the past, the court clarified that all such\nplans are to include a comprehensive discussion of what impact the construction and\nattendance-zone changes will have on the Board’s desegregation efforts. (JA 119.)\n\n        Finally, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53, the district court said it\nwould appoint a special master to consider the statistical data supplied by the parties and\nto make annual reports and recommendations to the court. (JA 117-18.) The court\ninstructed the parties jointly to select a special master with the requisite qualifications,\nwhich the court defined as a “neutral expert in educational research, preferably with\nexperience in desegregation issues . . . .” (JA 118.)\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.            Page 36\n\n\n                                     II. ANALYSIS\n\n        The record shows that the district court was both thorough and careful in\nconsidering the petition to declare the Shelby County Schools unitary. As a threshold\nmatter, the court held two public hearings, both of which involved witness testimony,\nargument by counsel, and the opportunity for participation by members of the\ncommunity. All parties were allowed to call and cross-examine witnesses, and the court\nasked questions as well. Following each hearing, the court asked the parties to provide\nspecific additional information. Just a few days after the second hearing, the court\nissued its opinion which, at sixty-two pages, gave comprehensive consideration to the\nentire history of the case, identified and discussed the relevant Supreme Court authority,\nand set forth a precise plan designed to eventually eliminate the need for the\ndesegregation decree and restore local control . The court also appended to its opinion\na 116-page procedural history of the case.\n\n        Before specifically addressing each of the three areas in which the district court\ndeclined to grant unitary status, it is important to clarify what the district court’s order\ndid and did not do. Contrary to the Board’s argument (repeated throughout its brief), the\ndistrict court did not order the Board to comply with a “strict racial quota.” True, the\ndistrict court held that the Board should endeavor to achieve a ratio of white to African-\nAmerican students in each school that mirrors the racial composition of the County-wide\nstudent population within fifteen percentage points, and that the Board should seek to\nachieve the same racial balance with respect to faculty. But the district court plainly\ncharacterized this as a “flexible goal” and “a starting point in analyzing the Board’s\nsuccess in desegregation.” Correctly citing applicable Supreme Court precedent, the\ndistrict court expressly rejected a rigid approach, saying that “racial balance is not a\nstrict requirement and there may be mitigating circumstances which would allow a\nschool system to operate one or more schools with a predominance of one race or\nanother without running afoul of its equal protection obligations under the Constitution.”\nThe district court also specifically instructed the Board to submit annually information\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363              Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.                         Page 37\n\n\ndescribing “mitigating factors” that make further progress toward racial balance\ninfeasible.\n\n         The Board appeals the district court’s order in its entirety. Although the\nGovernment supported a declaration of unitary status below, it does not appeal the\ndistrict court’s rulings retaining supervisory control. The Government says that it has\n“chosen not to appeal the denial of unitary status in light of the deferential clear error\nstandard of review that applies to that determination.” (Govt. Br. 29.) With respect to\nthe district court’s modification of the decree, establishing a “flexible” student-\nassignment goal, the Government concedes that it is “hard pressed to argue on appeal\nthat the district court’s ruling to the contrary was clear error, or that the student\nassignment goals that the court put in place to remedy the remaining racial imbalance\nin Shelby County’s schools are an abuse of discretion.” (Id.) The Government,\nhowever, is appealing the district court’s teacher-assignment goal on the ground that the\ncourt’s tying of the faculty racial ratio to the student racial ratio was an abuse of\ndiscretion.\n\n        1. The County Has Not Carried Its Burden as to Student Desegregation3\n\n         The Board argues that it has fully complied with the court’s orders regarding\ndesegregating its students. The record evidence is simply inadequate to support this\nassertion.\n\n         As an initial matter, there is no indication that the Board regularly reported to the\nCourt about the racial make-up of each of its schools relative to the County as a whole.\nStatistical data of this sort is largely absent from the record. Consequently, we cannot\nknow how the Board fared with respect to the court’s original student-desegregation goal\n(identical racial ratios in the schools and County within a deviation of ten percentage\n\n         3\n            In the specific setting of a school desegregation class action, “[w]here the relief sought in the\ndistrict court is the dissolution of a[ ] [desegregation decree], the order of the district court is subject to a\nmixed standard of review.” Manning ex rel.

Shelby County Bd. of Educ.               Page 38\n\n\npoints). As to those years for which there is more comprehensive data, the district court\nfound that the Board’s results were unimpressive. For instance, the court found that in\n1974, at least a quarter of the County’s schools had not attained “the target racial\ncomposition range established by the [c]ourt in 1968 and reiterated in . . . 1971 . . . .”\n(JA 106-07.) The court went on to note that “[c]uriously missing from the Board’s\nsubmissions was any explanation of why one school had only 2% African-American\nstudents while a handful of others had as much as 71%.” (JA 107.) The district court\nfound that by 1984, “[t]he racial balance in the schools continued to be uneven, with\nthree schools out of 34 having fewer than 5% African-American students and three\nhaving between 50% and 72%.” (JA 107-08.) Finally, the district court noted that in the\n2004-05 school year, only seventeen of the County’s forty-six schools “had a racial\nmakeup that was reflective, within ten percentage points, of the 32% African-American\nstudent composition of the district as a whole.” (JA 108.)\n\n        It is also difficult to evaluate the import of what little statistical data is available.\nIt is impossible to assess whether that data reflects all the desegregation that was feasible\nin Shelby County, or whether that data only reflects the desegregation that the County\nfound comfortable. This is the case because the record is virtually silent about what\nobstacles the Board confronted in meeting its desegregation obligations throughout the\n1970s and 1980s, how it handled those obstacles, and whether it pursued all practicable\nforms of relief or limited itself to only the most convenient ones.\n\n        The Board relies heavily on a chart detailing statistical data about the proportion\nof African-American students in each of its schools during the 2002-03 and 2007-08\nschool years. The Board claims that this evidence shows that County schools have\nbecome more diverse over the last five years. The Board’s data shows, however, that\namong the forty-four schools for which it has data (five schools were new), the African-\nAmerican student population in 2007-08 still varied widely, from a low of three percent\nto a high of ninety percent. If the County-wide African-American student population\nwas thirty-four percent in 2007, as the Board claims, then only fifteen of the forty-four\nschools for which the Board has demographic data would satisfy the district court’s\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363           Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.                 Page 39\n\n\nbenchmark for measuring racial balance, namely plus or minus fifteen percentage points\nfrom thirty-four percent (racially balanced schools using this metric would be those with\nan African-American student population of between nineteen and forty-nine percent).4\nJust ten of the County’s forty-four schools would satisfy the district court’s earlier goal\nof a school racial composition that mirrored the County’s within a margin of ten\npercentage points.\n\n        Finally, the Board insists that any current disparities in the racial composition of\nits schools are caused by demographic factors unrelated to its history of segregation and\nover which the Board has no control, and the district court has no authority to correct.\nThe Board also argues that annexations by the City of Memphis have affected, and will\ncontinue to affect, the African-American population within the County, making it a\n“moving target.” (Board Br. 9.) This argument may very well have some explanatory\nforce, but the Board did not put on sufficient evidence to substantiate it. As noted above,\nthe witness testimony at the two hearings consisted of little more than bare assertions\nthat the Board had done all it could, that discrimination was not tolerated, and that\nparents and administrators were proud of the school system’s accomplishments. The\nBoard did not present expert testimony about the shifting racial demographics within the\nCounty and how those changes affected the Board’s desegregation efforts. Nor did it\npresent expert testimony about the impact of the annexations by the City of Memphis.\nThe Board’s lack of evidentiary support on these issues stands in marked contrast to the\nevidence others in the Board’s shoes have presented in petitions to dissolve a\ndesegregation decree. See, e.g., Freeman, 503 U.S. at 471 (noting presentation of expert\ntestimony about demographic changes in the school system since the desegregation\ndecree was entered); Manning, 244 F.3d at 936 (noting presentation of “reports on\nattendance boundaries, demographic reports, and expert testimony” to address question\nof whether the racial identifiability of seventeen of the school system’s 150 schools was\ntraceable to the system’s prior discriminatory behavior or to something else). Even the\nGovernment agrees that most of the evidence presented at the July hearing ( in which the\n\n        4\n        The Government agrees. It says that “[i]n 2007, about 60% of the schools varied by more than\n15% from the system-wide racial ratio, with some as high as 90% black.” (Govt. Br. 37.)\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363         Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.             Page 40\n\n\nGovernment participated) was anecdotal. The Government notes that, “[t]he Board\npresented no minutes or other records documenting its decision-making and provided\nno demographic statistics or census maps beyond enrollment figures and charted\nattendance zones.” (Govt. Br. at 21.)\n\n        For these reasons, I would affirm the district court’s judgment denying unitary\nstatus on the issue of student desegregation.\n\n      2. The County Has Not Carried Its Burden As To Faculty Desegregation\n\n        The Board contends that the district court erred in failing to grant unitary status\npertaining to faculty integration. The Government contends that the district court erred\nin correlating the percentage of African-American teachers in each school with the\npercentage of African-American students in the County overall. Importantly, neither\nparty challenges the district court’s factual findings that the County did not fully comply\nwith the court’s directives to (1) reassign faculty between schools, (2) transfer opposite-\nrace teachers to fill vacancies, and (3) file the required notices and reports with the court.\nThe Government even concedes that the racial imbalance among the County’s teachers\n“create[s] a presumption against unitary status for faculty” and that “[a]ssignment of\nteachers according to flexible guidelines would not be an abuse of discretion.” The\nGovernment’s position—opposing the district court’s particular remedy but not\ndisagreeing that some type of remedy may be appropriate—implies that it does not\noppose a remand for the district court to re-formulate its faculty-desegregation remedy.\n\n        As described above, the district court modified the desegregation decree to tether\nthe racial composition of each school’s faculty to the racial composition of the County’s\nstudents. The Government opposes this exercise of the district court’s remedial\nauthority as an abuse of discretion, arguing that the proper comparison is the one the\ndistrict court previously endorsed but has since abandoned: comparing the proportion\nof African-American teachers in each school to the proportion of African-American\nteachers County-wide.\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363          Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.              Page 41\n\n\n        The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether faculty desegregation may be\naccomplished as the district court has suggested---through a flexible comparison of the\nproportion of African-American teachers in each school to the proportion of African-\nAmerican students in the district as a whole. The Government relies on Wygant v.\nJackson Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986) for the proposition that the Supreme\nCourt would disapprove of such a comparison. In Wygant, white teachers with more\nseniority were laid off ahead of African-American teachers, some of whom were merely\non probationary status. Id. at 272. The school board reasoned that this policy was\njustified in order to preserve the gains made in African-American hiring. Id. at 288. The\ndistrict court concluded that the layoffs did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, in\npart, because it determined that African-American students were entitled to role models\nof their own race. Id. at 274. The Supreme Court rejected the district court’s embrace\nof “the role model theory,” concluding that “by tying the required percentage of minority\nteachers to the percentage of minority students, it requires just the sort of year-to-year\ncalibration the Court stated was unnecessary in Swann. Id. at 276. Moreover, the\nSupreme Court reasoned that “[c]arried to its logical extreme, the idea that black\nstudents are better off with black teachers could lead to the very system the Court\nrejected in Brown . . . .” Id. The Court was apparently concerned that if the African-\nAmerican student population shrinks over time, that fact could be used to justify hiring\nfewer African-American teachers. See id. at 276. Conversely, if the African-American\nstudent population increases over time, that would require hiring more African-American\nteachers, which could increase the racial identifiability of the school. See id. Wygant,\nhowever, is distinguishable from this case because the policy imposed resulted in\nlayoffs, as opposed to faculty integration through transfers and reassignments.\n\n        As the Government indicates, this Court has held that a district court overseeing\na desegregation decree does not have the power to set a racial quota for the hiring of\nAfrican-American teachers. In Oliver v. Kalamazoo Education Association, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">757</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1983), we stated that “students . . . do not have a constitutional right to\nattend a school with a teaching staff of any particular racial composition . . . . Rather, . . .\nall that the students are entitled to is the sustained good faith effort to recruit minority\n\fNos. 07-6076/6363        Robinson, et al. v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ.           Page 42\n\n\nfaculty members so as to remedy the effects of any past discriminatory practices.” Id.\nat 762 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).             Oliver, however, is\ndistinguishable from this case because a rigid racial quota had been imposed for hiring\nteaching staff, as opposed to a flexible goal, which is what was imposed in this case.\n\n       Wygant and Oliver are therefore not on all fours with this case. Moreover, there\nis no reason to fear that the district court’s formulation will tend to increase the racial\nidentifiability of schools, or require a year-to-year re-calibration, as the Government\ncontends. The district court tied its faculty hiring goal to the African-American student\npopulation in the County as a whole, not the African-American student population in\neach school. Thus, a school with a student body that is fifty-five percent African-\nAmerican need not aim for a faculty that is fifty-five percent African-American. Rather,\nusing the 2007 County-wide statistic of thirty-four percent African-American students,\nsuch a school would endeavor to attain a faculty that is thirty-four percent African-\nAmerican, plus or minus fifteen percentage points.\n\n       For these reasons, I would hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin tying the percentage of African-American teachers in each school to the percentage\nof African-American students in the County as a whole.\n\n3. The Board Has Not Carried Its Burden With Respect to Extracurricular Activities\n\n       No more need be said about this. There is no basis for reversing as clearly\nerroneous the district court’s denial of unitary status as to extracurricular activities in\nlight of the almost non-existent record on this subject.\n\n                                  III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons articulated above, I respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
