Appellee, an inmate of the Delaware\nDepartment of Correction, asserted civil rights infractions\nunder 42 U.S.C. S 1983, claiming that appellants 1) violated\nthe Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual\npunishment by exposing him to environmental tobacco\nsmoke (\"ETS\") that created a serious medical need and\nposed an unreasonable risk of harm (Count I) and 2)\nretaliated and used excessive force against him for filing his\nETS lawsuit (Counts III and IV). Appellants1 raise three\nissues on appeal: 1) whether appellants are entitled to\nqualified immunity for the ETS claims; 2) whether\nappellants are entitled to qualified immunity on the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The appellants are Stanley Taylor (Commissioner of the Department of\nCorrection), Warden Raphael Williams, Major Perry Phelps, Sergeant\nPhillip Parker, Correctional Officer Fred Way, and Corporal Andre Green.\nAll ranks are those held by appellants at the time of filing of the\ncomplaint.\n\n                                2\n\n\nretaliation and excessive force claims; and 3) whether\nappellants in supervisory positions are entitled to qualified\nimmunity on all claims because they lacked notice of the\nunderlying events. As to the first two issues, we will affirm\nthe District Court’s denial of summary judgment. We\nconclude that we lack jurisdiction to decide the third issue.\n\nI. BACKGROUND2\n\nAppellee Roger Atkinson is a blind, diabetic prisoner who\nwas housed at Delaware’s Multi-Purpose Criminal Justice\nFacility (\"MPCJF \"). Although a former one-pack-per-day\nsmoker, appellee quit in 1995 after receiving surgery for a\npituitary adenoma.\n\nAtkinson’s ETS claims arise under the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\nHe asserts that from November, 1998, until November,\n1999, appellants subjected him to cruel and unusual\npunishment by exhibiting deliberate indifference to his\nclaims that he was being involuntarily exposed to high\nlevels of second-hand smoke, which forced him to endure\nsevere allergic reactions to ETS and posed an unreasonable\nrisk of future harm to his health. According to his answers\nto interrogatories, during a seven-month incarceration at\nMPCJF he shared a cell with two inmates, each of whom\nsmoked \"constantly\" while in the cell. Appellee shared\nanother cell with a constant smoker for six weeks, and later\nwith a cellmate who smoked ten cigarettes per day.\nAppellee also claims that he has been exposed to other\nsmoking cellmates on various occasions.\n\nShortly after being exposed to ETS and suffering\nsymptoms from it, appellee complained to the medical staff\n\fat MPCJF and Sergeant Sonata. Atkinson alleges that when\nhe tried to seek help at the prison infirmary, the treating\nnurse responded that she was unable to transfer him to a\ncell with a nonsmoking roommate. Although Sonata moved\nappellee to a smoke-free area, Way later returned him to a\nsmoking environment. Thereafter appellee wrote letters to\nWilliams, Captain Lee, Phelps, Parker, and Taylor about his\nexposure to ETS. The exposure did not cease.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. We accept the facts as the District Court stated them in its opinion.\n\n                                3\n\n\nAppellee twice complained to Parker, the supervisor of\nPods 1F and 1E, about his exposure to ETS, but Parker\nrefused to move him to a smoke-free area. Appellee also\ncomplained to Green and requested that he be removed\nfrom exposure but was not moved.\n\nAtkinson’s amended complaint alleges that he was\nexposed, with deliberate indifference, to constant smoking\nin his cell for over seven months and as a result suffered\nnausea, an inability to eat, headaches, chest pains,\ndifficulty breathing, numbness in his limbs, teary eyes,\nitching, burning skin, dizziness, a sore throat, coughing\nand production of sputum. Albert A. Rizzo, M.D., a\npulmonary specialist who examined appellee concluded\nthat there was a \"reasonable medical probability\" that these\nsymptoms were precipitated by second-hand smoke.\nHowever, in an affidavit, prison physician Dr. Keith Ivens\ndisputed Dr. Rizzo’s evaluation and contended that\nAtkinson’s symptoms arose from seasonal allergies. A.\nJudson Wells, Ph.D. stated in an expert report:\"I would say\nthat for Mr. Atkinson to continue in a smoke filled cell\nwould increase his risk of death or non-fatal heart attack or\nstroke.\"\n\nAppellee also asserts that MPCJF officials subjected him\nto a variety of abuses in retaliation for filing his lawsuit. He\ncontends that Way told him that if he had not complained\nabout ETS he would not have been placed in administrative\nsegregation. On repeated occasions, Way read appellee’s\npersonal mail over the prison’s intercom so that other\ninmates could hear it. On or before May 4, 2000, notes\nrelating to appellee’s ETS case were taken from his cell and\nwere read over the intercom by Way and Officer Johnson.\nWay withheld papers that appellee requested from the law\nlibrary. On other occasions, Way refused to permit appellee\nto make telephone calls to his attorney. Way also cursed\nappellee and made derogatory comments about his\nblindness. When appellee asked Way to stop harassing him,\nWay again cursed him and stated that Way was above the\nlaw. Parker was aware of these actions but failed to stop\nthem. Way and Parker placed appellee in solitary\nconfinement during recreation periods, thereby depriving\nhim of the assistance of people able to read his mail or help\n\n                                4\n\fhim with legal work, allegedly for the purpose of preventing\nhim from proceeding with his civil action. On October 5,\n2000, Way prevented appellee from receiving his one hour\nof recreation and falsely wrote in the prison log that he had\nrefused recreation.\n\nAdditionally, appellee either received or was threatened\nwith physical retaliation for filing his lawsuit. In January or\nFebruary of 1999, Way entered appellee’s cell while he was\nsleeping, grabbed him by the leg and pulled appellee from\nhis bed, stating that he thought appellee was dead. On\nMarch 29, 2000, Way threatened to attack appellee and\ntook appellee’s clothing, leaving appellee without clothing\nfor over ten hours. On another occasion, Way entered\nappellee’s cell and threatened to smash his face into the\nwall. Another time, Way stated that he would hang\nappellee. On multiple occasions, Way prevented appellee\nfrom receiving his medications or tampered with his food.\nWay and Parker have threatened appellee and told him that\nhe would never make it to court. Various times Way told\nappellee that Way would \"kick [his] ass,\" that his privileges\nwould be taken away, and that there was nothing that he\ncould do about it. On December 26, 2000, appellee was\nattacked by Green, who struck him in the face and head.\nThis incident was investigated by the FBI, apparently\nbecause of complaints made by appellee’s mother.\nThereafter, Way told appellee over the intercom that he\nwould regret bringing the FBI into the matter and that Way\nwould make him pay. When appellee was leaving an\ninterview room Way ordered appellee to take off his\nclothing. After appellee disrobed, Way kicked his clothing\naround and said that he had to make sure that appellee\nwas not a woman because women were sent to another\nfacility. On December 27, 2000, Green refused to bring\nappellee his breakfast and lunch trays. On February 16,\n2001, when appellee returned from a court appearance, he\nwas strip searched in booking, which is standard\nprocedure. Appellee then returned to Pod 1F and for no\nreason Way made him strip again.\n\nAccording to appellee, he has written to Williams, Phelps,\nTaylor, and Parker, and spoken to Green, about the\nharassment he received from Way.\n\n                                5\n\n\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nReview by this Court is plenary when a denial of qualified\nimmunity turns solely on a question of law. Brown v.\nArmenti, 247 F.3d 69, 72 (3d Cir. 2001). We recently\nreiterated that this Court lacks jurisdiction to evaluate the\nsufficiency of the evidence when reviewing a denial of\nsummary judgment based on a lack of qualified immunity.\nWalker v. Horn, 286 F.3d 705, 710 (3d Cir. 2002) (\"[W]e\nmust adopt the facts assumed by the District Court.\"); see\nalso Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 319 (1995) (no\n\finterlocutory appeal from denial of summary judgment\nbased on remaining genuine issues of material fact).\nAlthough we may not evaluate the sufficiency of the\nevidence to prove the facts allegedly giving rise to a\nconstitutional claim, we may determine whether the facts\nidentified by the District Court constitute a violation of a\nclearly established constitutional right. See Ziccardi v. City\nof Philadelphia, 288 F.3d 57, 61 (3d. Cir. 2002).\n\nIII. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\n\nIn Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001), the Supreme\nCourt explained the two-part inquiry a court must make in\norder to determine whether a state official is entitled to\nqualified immunity:\n\n        A court required to rule upon the qualified immunity\n       issue must consider, then, this threshold question:\n       Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting\n       the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer’s\n       conduct violated a constitutional right? . . .\n\n        If no constitutional right would have been violated\n       were the allegations established, there is no necessity\n       for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity. On\n       the other hand, if a violation could be made out on a\n       favorable view of the parties’ submissions, the next,\n       sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly\n       established.\n\nId. at 201.\n\nTo be clearly established \"[t]he contours of the right must\nbe sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would\n\n                                6\n\n\nunderstand that what he is doing violates that right.\"\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987). The\nSaucier Court further explained the latter prong of the test:\n\n        This inquiry, it is vital to note, must be undertaken\n       in light of the specific context of the case, not as a\n       broad general proposition; and it too serves to advance\n       understanding of the law and to allow officers to avoid\n       the burden of trial if qualified immunity is applicable\n       . . . .\n\n        This is not to say that the formulation of a general\n       rule is beside the point, nor is it to insist the courts\n       must have agreed upon the precise formulation of the\n       standard. Assuming, for instance, that various courts\n       have agreed that certain conduct is a constitutional\n       violation under facts not distinguishable in a fair way\n       from the facts presented in the case at hand, the officer\n       would not be entitled to qualified immunity based\n       simply on the argument that courts had not agreed on\n       one verbal formulation of the controlling standard.\n\fSaucier, 533 U.S. at 201, 203.\n\nA. The ETS claims\n\nAtkinson asserts two separate Eighth Amendment claims\nagainst defendants stemming from his involuntary exposure\nto ETS: 1) a claim for potential future harm arising from his\nexposure to ETS; and 2) a present injury claim stemming\nfrom deliberate indifference to existing medical needs\ncaused by ETS. We will sequentially address whether\ndefendants are entitled to qualified immunity for each\nclaim.\n\n1. Future Injury Claim\n\nWith respect to the future injury claim, Helling v.\nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25 (1993), established the\nconstitutional right required by the first prong of the\nSaucier test for qualified immunity. In Helling, the Supreme\nCourt determined that a cause of action exists under the\nEighth Amendment when a prisoner alleges that prison\nofficials have exposed him, with deliberate indifference, to\nlevels of ETS that pose an unreasonable risk of harm to his\n\n                                 7\n\n\nfuture health. Id. at 35 (concluding that prisoner stated a\nclaim where he was forced to share a cell with a five-pack-\nper-day smoker). As to the second part of the Saucier\ninquiry, the Helling Court clearly established the elements\nof a two-part test that a plaintiff must meet to state a valid\nclaim under the Eighth Amendment.\n\nThe Court explained that the first prong of the Helling\ntest is an objective one: \"[The prisoner] must show that he\nhimself is being exposed to unreasonably high levels of\nETS.\" Id. at 35. With respect to the objective factor, the\nCourt noted that beyond a scientific and statistical inquiry\ninto the seriousness of the potential harm and the\nlikelihood that such injury to health will actually be caused\nby exposure to ETS, the Eighth Amendment requires\"a\ncourt to assess whether society considers the risk that the\nprisoner complains of to be so grave that it violates\ncontemporary standards of decency to expose anyone\nunwillingly to such a risk.\" Id. at 36 (emphasis in original).\nThe Court stated: \"In other words, the prisoner must show\nthat the risk of which he complains is not one that today’s\nsociety chooses to tolerate.\" Id.\n\nThe second prong of the Helling test is a subjective one:\nwhether prison officials were deliberately indifferent to a\nserious risk of harm. Id. at 36. The Supreme Court has\nheld that \"a prison official cannot be found liable under the\nEighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane\nconditions of confinement unless the official knows of and\ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the\nofficial must both be aware of facts from which the\ninference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious\nharm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\" Farmer\n\fv. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994).\n\nIn concluding, the Helling Court held that the prisoner\nhad properly claimed that the level of ETS to which he was\nexposed unreasonably endangered his future health.\nHelling, 509 U.S. at 35. The Court remanded the case so\nthat the prisoner could attempt to prove the objective and\nsubjective elements necessary to establish a violation of the\nEighth Amendment. Id.\n\nSince 1993, almost every Court of Appeals that has\n\n                                8\n\n\naddressed this issue has recognized that a prisoner’s right\nto be free from levels of ETS that pose an unreasonable risk\nof future harm was clearly established by Helling.3 See\nAlvarado v. Litscher, 267 F.3d 648, 653 (7th Cir. 2001)\n(affirming District Court’s denial of Rule 12(b)(6) motion to\ndismiss based on qualified immunity where a prisoner\nasserted that ETS exacerbated severe chronic asthma);\nWarren v. Keane, 196 F.3d 330, 333 (2d Cir. 1999) (denying\nprison officials’ motion for summary judgment based on\nqualified immunity in an ETS case); Whitley v. Hunt, 158\nF.3d 882, 887-88 (5th Cir. 1998) (concluding ETS claim\nwas wrongly dismissed as frivolous where prison doctor\nissued report noting that prisoner required nonsmoking\nquarters), overruled on other grounds by Booth v. Churner,\n532 U.S. 731, 735 (2001); Rochon v. City of Angola,\nLouisiana, 122 F.3d 319, 320 (5th Cir. 1997) (affirming\nDistrict Court’s denial of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss\nbased on qualified immunity where prisoner asserted that\nhe was forced to live and work in an environment filled with\ntobacco smoke, even though the smoke had not yet harmed\nhis health but allegedly posed a threat to his health in the\nfuture); Jacobs v. Young, No. 94-3241, 1995 WL 150402, at\n**2 (6th Cir. April 5, 1995) (unpublished opinion)\n(concluding prisoner’s right to be free from harmful levels of\nETS was clearly established in 1993); see also Weaver v.\nClarke, 45 F.3d 1253, 1256 (8th Cir. 1995) (affirming\nDistrict Court’s denial of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss\nbased on qualified immunity where a prisoner alleged\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Instead of relying upon cases that directly deal with the question of\nwhether prison officials should be afforded qualified immunity in ETS\nsuits, the dissent cites to cases which in our view are inapplicable. See\nHenderson v. Sheahan, 196 F.3d 839, 853 (7th Cir. 2000); Oliver v.\nDeen, 77 F.3d 156, 159 (7th Cir. 1996). The Henderson and Oliver\nCourts did not consider the issue of qualified immunity but affirmed\ngrants of summary judgment to the defendants based on a lack of\nevidence. See Henderson, 196 F.3d at 853; Oliver, 77 F.3d at 159.\nMoreover, in a later case the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\narguably made the strongest ruling that ETS claims are clearly\nestablished for the purposes of qualified immunity:\"Given the decision\nin Helling, the right of a prisoner to not be subjected to a serious risk of\nhis future health resulting from ETS was clearly established in 1998-99.\"\nAlvarado v. Litscher, 267 F.3d 648, 653 (7th Cir. 2001).\n\f                                9\n\n\nsevere headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and\nbreathing difficulties from rooming with \"heavy smoker\");\nbut see Mills v. Clark, No. 99-6334, 2000 WL 1250781, at\n**4 (4th Cir. Sept. 5, 2000) (unpublished opinion) (reversing\nDistrict Court’s denial of qualified immunity on summary\njudgment for prison officials because it was not clearly\nestablished level of ETS in dormitories posed any\nunreasonable risk of future harm).4\n\nIn a case identical in facts and procedural posture to the\npresent one, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nheld that a District Court correctly denied prison officials’\nsummary judgment motion based on qualified immunity\nwhere prisoners claimed to be suffering from sinus\nproblems, headaches, dizziness, nausea, shortness of\nbreath, chest pains and asthma from cellmates’ smoking in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The dissent distinguishes ETS cases that survive a motion to dismiss\nfrom those involving a denial of summary judgment by noting that the\nformer require no evidentiary support for a plaintiff ’s claims: \"motions to\ndismiss [are submitted at] a much easier stage to survive than summary\njudgment because, unlike summary judgment, motions to dismiss\nrequire no evidentiary support for the plaintiffs’ claims.\" In making this\nargument the dissent appears to be evaluating the underlying evidence.\nThis is the exercise that Ziccardi forbids us from undertaking on this\nappeal:\n\n       As we understand Johnson, if a defendant in a constitutional tort\n       case moves for summary judgment based on qualified immunity and\n       the district court denies the motion, we lack jurisdiction to consider\n       whether the district court correctly identified the set of facts that the\n       summary judgment record is sufficient to prove; but we possess\n       jurisdiction to review whether the set of facts identified by the\n       district court is sufficient to establish a violation of a clearly\n       established constitutional right.\n\n288 F.3d at 61; see also Sanders v. Brundage, 60 F.3d 484, 487-88 (8th\nCir. 1995) (refusing to consider \"insufficient evidence\" argument on\nappeal from denial of qualified immunity on a motion for summary\njudgment for prisoner’s ETS claim). The present appeal from appellants’\ndenial of summary judgment, however, is interlocutory in nature and\nbased on a denial of qualified immunity. Because the Supreme Court’s\nruling in Johnson prevents us from weighing the evidence, the present\ncase is more analogous to a 12(b)(6) motion, where we would not\nevaluate the underlying evidence to support the plaintiff ’s claims which\nthe District Court chose to accept. See Ziccardi , 288 F.3d at 61.\n\n                                10\n\n\nSing Sing prison. Warren, 196 F.3d at 333. The Warren\nCourt held that after Helling \"it was clearly established that\nprison officials could violate the Eighth Amendment\nthrough deliberate indifference to an inmate’s exposure to\nlevels of ETS that posed an unreasonable risk of future\nharm to the inmate’s health.\"5Id. Moreover, the Warren\n\fCourt concluded that it would be unreasonable for prison\nofficials to believe that they were not violating the prisoners’\nEighth Amendment rights where the District Court\ndetermined that \"[p]laintiffs’ allegations, if believed,\noverwhelmingly describe a prison environment permeated\nwith smoke resulting from, inter alia, under-enforcement of\ninadequate smoking rules, overcrowding of inmates, and\npoor ventilation.\" Id.\n\nIn the present case, without weighing the underlying\nevidence with respect to Atkinson’s claim, we conclude that\nappellants are not entitled to qualified immunity on the\nETS claim of future harm. As the Warren Court recognized,\nthe Helling decision established the constitutional right\nrequired by the first prong of the Saucier test. Warren, 196\nF.3d at 333; see also Helling, 509 U.S. at 35. Atkinson\ninvokes the constitutional right claimed by the Helling\nprisoner: alleging that he was unwillingly exposed to levels\nof ETS that pose an unreasonable risk of future harm.\n\nSimilarly, Atkinson has satisfied the second prong of the\nSaucier test. The right recognized by the Helling decision is\n\"clearly established\" so that a reasonable prison official\nwould know when he is violating that right. See, e.g.,\nAlvarado, 267 F.3d at 653 (\"Given the decision in Helling,\nthe right of a prisoner to not be subjected to a serious risk\nof his future health resulting from ETS was clearly\nestablished in 1998-99.\"); Warren, 196 F.3d at 333 (\"We\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The dissent characterizes Warren as a cursory opinion lacking\npersuasive value that is not binding on this Court. However, the dissent\nfails to acknowledge that Warren is directly on-point. See Warren, 196\nF.3d at 333 (\"We hold that after Helling, it was clearly established that\nprison officials could violate the Eighth Amendment through deliberate\nindifference to an inmate’s exposure to levels of ETS that posed an\nunreasonable risk of future harm to the inmate’s health.\"). The facts and\nprocedural posture of the Warren decision, a denial of qualified immunity\non summary judgment, are a carbon copy of the present case.\n\n                                11\n\n\nhold that after Helling, it was clearly established that prison\nofficials could violate the Eighth Amendment through\ndeliberate indifference to an inmate’s exposure to levels of\nETS that posed an unreasonable risk of future harm to the\ninmate’s health.\"). The facts of Helling are similar to the\nfacts presented by the appellee. In Helling a prisoner was\nhoused with a five-packs-per-day smoker and complained\nof \"certain health problems.\" Id. at 28. Here, appellee\nAtkinson was housed for over seven months with \"constant\"\nsmokers.\n\nAs to future harm Atkinson has offered some proof for\neach element of the alleged Eighth Amendment violation: 1)\nevidence that he was exposed to unreasonably high levels of\nETS, the risk of which is not one that today’s society\nchooses to tolerate; and 2) evidence that prison officials\nknew of and disregarded an excessive risk to his health or\n\fsafety. As to the first element, appellee’s deposition and\ninterrogatory answers state that he was subjected to\ncontinuous smoking for at least seven months.\nDemonstrating a risk of future harm, A. Judson Wells,\nPh.D. provided statistics and opined in his expert report\nthat \"for Mr. Atkinson to continue in a smoke filled cell\nwould increase his risk of death or non-fatal heart attack or\nstroke.\" With respect to the causal link between ETS and\nappellee’s symptoms, Dr. Rizzo’s letter concluded that there\nwas a \"reasonable medical probability\" that appellee’s\nsymptoms (itchy and burning eyes, chest pains, a sore\nthroat, a persistent cough with sputum production,\nparoxysms of coughing and resulting headaches) were\nprecipitated by second-hand smoke. Although other Courts\nof Appeals have affirmed a grant of summary judgment to\nprison officials on similar evidence as \"too speculative,\"6 we\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. For an example, see Henderson, 196 F.3d at 853. The procedural\nposture of Henderson, an appeal from a grant of summary judgment to\nprison officials for lack of evidence of future harm, allowed the Court of\nAppeals to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence. See id. If appellee can\nproduce evidence of future harm, he may be able to recover monetary\ndamages. See Fontroy, 150 F.3d at 244. However, the problematic\nquantification of those future damages is not relevant to the present\ninquiry concerning whether the underlying constitutional right was\nclearly established so that a reasonable prison official would know that\n\n                                12\n\n\nare deciding the issue of qualified immunity, and cannot\nevaluate the sufficiency of the evidence. See Johnson, 515\nU.S. at 319. In addition, appellee has presented evidence\nthat society has become unwilling to tolerate the imposition\non anyone of continuous unwanted risks of second-hand\nsmoke, citing Executive Order 71, in which the Governor of\nDelaware banned smoking in state buildings except in\ncertain designated areas.7 As to the second Helling element,\ndefendants’ answers to Atkinson’s interrogatories and the\ndepositions of Way, Phelps, and Parker demonstrate that\nappellants knew tobacco smoke was dangerous.\nAdditionally, the District Court relied upon Atkinson’s\nstatements that he either spoke or wrote to all appellants\nregarding unreasonable ETS he was experiencing.\n\n2. Present Injury Claim\n\nAtkinson’s present injury claim for ETS exposure also is\ngrounded in a clearly established constitutional right.\nAlthough Helling dealt only with prisoner’s risk of future\nharm, the Supreme Court clearly established the framework\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nhe subjected appellee to the risk of future harm. Moreover, even if\nappellee is unable to establish a right to compensatory damages, he may\nbe entitled to nominal damages. See Pryer v. C.O. 3 Slavic, 251 F.3d 448,\n453 (3d Cir. 2001) (\"Where a constitutional deprivation has not caused\nactual injury, an award of nominal damages may be appropriate.\").\n\f7. The dissent characterizes this reference as an attempt to form a\nsocietal consensus from a single state regulation. However, we refer to\nthe regulation merely to show that Atkinson has offered some proof of a\nsocietal consensus. Proof of a national consensus might include, inter\nalia, the federal regulation which protects the public and federal\nemployees from ETS in all federal workplaces:\n\n       Pursuant to Executive Order 13058, \"Protecting Federal Employees\n       and the Public From Exposure to Tobacco Smoke in the Federal\n       Workplace\" (3 CFR, 1997 Comp., p. 216), it is the policy of the\n       executive branch to establish a smoke-free environment for Federal\n       employees and members of the public visiting or using Federal\n       facilities. The smoking of tobacco products is prohibited in all\n       interior space owned, rented, or leased by the executive branch of\n       the Federal Government, and in any outdoor areas under executive\n       branch control in front of air intake ducts.\n\n41 CFR S 101-20.105-3(a).\n\n                                13\n\n\nfor analyzing claims of present harm in Estelle v. Gamble,\n429 U.S. 97 (1976). See Weaver, 45 F.3d at 1256. In\nWeaver, a case directly on-point, the Court of Appeals for\nthe Eighth Circuit held that Estelle clearly established that\nprison officials could not be deliberately indifferent to a\nprisoner’s existing serious medical needs caused by ETS.\nId. at 1256. In affirming the District Court’s denial of\nqualified immunity to the prison officials the Weaver Court\nstated, \"Such claims were first recognized by the Supreme\nCourt almost two decades ago.\" Id. at 1256.\n\nIn Estelle, the Supreme Court concluded that deliberate\nindifference to serious medical needs of prisoners\nconstitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,\nwhich violates the Eighth Amendment. 429 U.S. at 104.\nThe Estelle Court recognized that even in less serious\ncases, where the prisoner does not experience severe\ntorment or a lingering death, the infliction of unnecessary\nsuffering is inconsistent with standards of decency. See id.\nat 103. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated:\"In order to\nstate a cognizable claim, a prisoner must allege acts or\nomissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate\nindifference to serious medical needs. It is only such\nindifference that can offend ‘evolving standards of decency’\nin violation of the Eighth Amendment.\" Id. at 106.\n\nAtkinson has alleged a serious medical need to which\nappellants were deliberately indifferent. As this Court\nexplained in Monmouth County Correctional Institutional\nInmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326 (3d Cir. 1987),\"The\nstandard enunciated in Estelle is two-pronged: ‘[i]t requires\ndeliberate indifference on the part of the prison officials and\nit requires the prisoner’s medical needs to be serious.’ \" Id.\nat 346, quoting West v. Keve, 571 F.2d 158, 162 (3d 1978).\nAlthough this Court has defined a medical need as serious\nif it has been diagnosed by a physician as requiring\ntreatment, we also have recognized: \"Estelle makes clear\nthat if ‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,’ . . .\n\fresults as a consequence of denial or delay in the provision\nof adequate medical care, the medical need is of the serious\nnature contemplated by the Eighth Amendment.\" Id. at\n347. Needless suffering resulting from a denial of simple\nmedical care, which does not serve any penological\n\n                                14\n\n\npurpose, is inconsistent with contemporary standards of\ndecency and thus violates the Eighth Amendment. See id.\n\nIn Weaver, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\nspecifically recognized that severe headaches, dizziness,\nnausea, vomiting, and breathing difficulties stemming from\nexposure to ETS constituted a serious medical need, which\nrequired removal of the prisoner from a smoking\nenvironment under the Eighth Amendment. Id. at 1254.\nSimilarly, other Courts of Appeals have recognized that an\nillness arising from an inmate’s exposure to ETS can\nconstitute a serious medical condition. See, e.g., Alvarado,\n267 F.3d at 651 (\"[Prisoner]’s complaint stated an Eighth\nAmendment claim when he alleged that because of the\nprison officials’ deliberate indifference, he was being\nexposed to levels of ETS which aggravated his chronic\nasthma, thereby endangering his existing health, a claim\nrecognized as an Eighth Amendment violation twenty-five\nyears ago in Estelle v. Gamble . . . .\"); 8 Hunt v. Reynolds,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. The dissent points out that the Seventh Circuit decisions of Henderson\nand Oliver rejected present injury claims similar to Atkinson’s because\nthe prisoners in those cases were unable to prove that their medical\nneeds were sufficiently serious. See Henderson , 196 F.3d at 846; Oliver,\n77 F.3d at 161. Again, in our view the dissent engages in the sort of\nevidence weighing that we are forbidden from undertaking by Johnson,\n515 U.S. at 313. See Ziccardi, 288 F.3d at 61; see also Sanders, 60 F.3d\n487-88 (refusing to consider \"insufficient evidence\" argument on appeal\nfrom denial of qualified immunity on motion for summary judgment for\nprisoner’s ETS claim). Moreover, the Oliver Court did not conclude that\nsuch symptoms were insufficiently serious as a matter of law. See Oliver,\n77 F.3d at 161 (\"On this record, Oliver has not demonstrated that he\nwas subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.\"). As the dissent in\nOliver clearly explained, the entire panel agreed that the prisoner’s\nallegations (which are similar to Atkinson’s) satisfied the requirements of\nEstelle:\n\n       No one disputes that Oliver’s allegations were enough to satisfy\n       Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976),\n       Farmer and the other Eighth Amendment cases. Both here and in\n       the lower court the issue has been instead whether there were\n       disputed issues of fact. Viewed in this light, it is clear that there is\n       a material dispute of fact about the severity of Oliver’s asthma\n       problem, which in turn raises a material dispute of fact about\n\n                                15\n\n\n974 F.2d 734, 735-36 (6th Cir. 1992). The Hunt   Court\ndetermined that:\n\f       \"Medical consequences of tobacco smoke do not differ\n       from other medical problems. Prisoners allergic to the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       whether the prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his\n       serious medical needs.\n\nOliver, 77 F.3d at 161 (Wood, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original).\nAlthough the Court of Appeals found the Henderson prisoner’s\nallegations insufficient as a matter of law, we believe it is clear that\nbreathable air that will not constantly subject a susceptible prisoner to\nsevere allergic reactions is the sort of \"minimal civilized measure of life’s\nnecessities\" that the Eighth Amendment protects. See Farmer, 511 U.S.\nat 834. Therefore, we refuse to hold as a matter of law that Atkinson’s\nsymptoms were insufficiently serious.\n\nThe dissent cites to other decisions to support its general proposition\nthat the tide has turned against ETS claims in the Courts of Appeals.\nSee Richardson v. Spurlock, 260 F.3d 495, 499 (5th Cir. 2001) (affirming\nDistrict Court’s dismissal of prisoner’s ETS claim as \"frivolous\"); Scott v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 139 F.3d 940, 944 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (reversing\nDistrict Court’s injunction mandating smoke-free environments for\nplaintiffs). Both cases are distinguishable from the present one. In\nRichardson, the prisoner’s exposure was at best de minimis and the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit clearly set it apart from cases\nwhere prisoners were housed in a severe ETS environment:\n\n       [T]he two Fifth Circuit cases that have recognized a potential ETS-\n       based Eighth Amendment claim, the exposure to second-hand\n       smoke was substantially more severe and sustained than that\n       alleged by Richardson. See Whitley v. Hunt, 158 F.3d 882, 888 (5th\n       Cir. 1998) (the prisoner shared living quarters with a smoker);\n       Rochon v. City of Angola, 122 F.3d 319, 320 (5th Cir. 1997) (the\n       inmate was \"required to live and work in ‘environments filled with\n       tobacco smoke’ \"). In contrast, Richardson does not share living\n       quarters with a smoker, nor does he work in a smoke-filled\n       environment. He only alleges that he had to sit near some smokers\n       during a bus ride on \"several occasions.\" We do not believe that\n       society considers this treatment to \"violate[ ] contemporary\n       standards of decency.\"\n\n260 F.3d at 498-99. Unlike Richardson and Scott, the issue in this case\ndoes not involve a complete ban on all ETS exposure. Such a ban may\nbe impractical (or impossible) for prison officials to implement. Here, we\nmerely conclude that the District Court correctly determined that the\nlevel of ETS to which Atkinson claims he was exposed and his symptoms\njustify the denial of qualified immunity.\n\n                                16\n\n\n       components of tobacco smoke, or who can attribute\n       their serious medical conditions to smoke, are entitled\n       to appropriate medical treatment, which may include\n       removal from places where smoke hovers\" . . . . Thus\n       we will adhere to the position, adopted by every circuit\n       to address the issue, that the Eighth Amendment’s\n       objective component is violated by forcing a prisoner\n       with a serious medical need for a smoke-free\n\f       environment to share his cell with an inmate who\n       smokes.\n\nId., quoting Steading v. Thompson, 941 F.2d 498, 500 (7th\nCir. 1991).\n\nWe cannot conclude that appellants are entitled to\nqualified immunity. Atkinson has fulfilled Saucier’s first\nprong for denying qualified immunity by alleging a violation\nof a clearly established constitutional right. As both the\nWeaver and Alvarado Courts point out the Constitutional\nright alleged by Atkinson was established over two decades\nago by the Supreme Court in Estelle. See Alvarado, 267\nF.3d at 651; Weaver, 45 F.3d at 1256. Atkinson’s amended\ncomplaint alleges that he was exposed, with deliberate\nindifference, to constant smoking in his cell for over seven\nmonths and as a result suffered nausea, an inability to eat,\nheadaches, chest pains, difficulty breathing, numbness in\nhis limbs, teary eyes, itching, burning skin, dizziness, a\nsore throat, coughing and production of sputum. The\ndissent describes these symptoms as \"causing discomfort\nsomewhere between that of hay fever and the common cold\"\nand notes that \"millions of people not in prison voluntarily\ntolerate similar levels of risk every day from second-hand\nsmoke and numerous other sources.\" However, unlike\nindividuals who voluntarily expose themselves to ETS, a\nprisoner cannot simply walk out of his cell whenever he\nwishes. When a susceptible prisoner is confined to a cell, a\nsmall and confined space, with a \"constant\" smoker for an\nextended period of time, such symptoms may transform\nwhat would otherwise be a passing annoyance into a\nserious ongoing medical need. Additionally, Atkinson has\nfulfilled the second prong of Saucier’s test by demonstrating\nthat the constitutional right was clearly established by the\nHunt, Weaver and Estelle Courts on or before his own claim\n\n                                17\n\n\narose in 1998-1999. See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104 (\"We\ntherefore conclude that deliberate indifference to serious\nmedical needs of prisoners constitutes the ‘unnecessary\nand wanton infliction of pain,’ . . . proscribed by the Eighth\nAmendment.\"); Weaver, 45 F.3d at 1256 (recognizing that\nsevere headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and\nbreathing difficulties stemming from exposure to ETS\nconstitutes a serious medical need, which requires removal\nof the prisoner from a smoking environment under the\nEighth Amendment); Hunt, 974 F.2d 735-36 (concluding\nprisoner could state a present injury claim for ETS\nexposure); see also Alvarado, 267 F.3d at 651-52\n(\"[Prisoner]’s complaint stated an Eighth Amendment claim\nwhen he alleged that because of the prison officials’\ndeliberate indifference, he was being exposed to levels of\nETS which aggravated his chronic asthma, thereby\nendangering his existing health, a claim recognized as an\nEighth Amendment violation twenty-five years ago in Estelle\nv. Gamble . . . .\").9 Moreover, Dr. Rizzo, an examining\nphysician, has concluded that these symptoms possibly\nwere precipitated by Atkinson’s exposure to ETS. 10 The\n\f_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. Although Alvarado postdates the time when Atkinson’s cause of action\naccrued, we cite to that case to demonstrate that, as the Court of\nAppeals for the Seventh Circuit recognized, the constitutional right\nwhich Atkinson asserts was clearly established over twenty-five years ago\nin Estelle.\n\n10. The dissent contends that Dr. Rizzo’s affidavit undermines Atkinson’s\nclaim. Aside from the matter that the dissent is weighing the evidence\nsupporting the District Court’s determination in contravention of\nZiccardi, the dissent misconstrues Dr. Rizzo’s statements. Dr. Rizzo\nnoted the following:\n\n       Roger Atkinson is a former cigarette smoker who was diagnosed\n       with childhood asthma and may have symptoms of persistent\n       reactive nasal passages and airways based on his response to\n       exposure to seasonal changes in temperature and air quality. His\n       spirometry is currently normal, but this does not preclude the\n       presence of airway sensitivity.\n\n(A. 127). If anything, this notation supports Atkinson’s claim that he is\nparticularly sensitized to air quality and that ETS seriously exacerbates\nhis underlying condition. The dissent also points out that the affidavit of\nDr. Keith Ivens weakens Atkinson’s claim. This, however, takes this\nCourt into the forbidden territory of evidence weighing.\n\n                                18\n\n\nDistrict Court found that deliberate indifference to these\nalleged symptoms constituted a violation of clearly\nestablished law, and we agree. Atkinson alleges that when\nhe tried to seek help at the prison infirmary the treating\nnurse responded that she was unable to transfer him to a\ncell with a nonsmoking roommate. Similarly, Atkinson has\nproduced evidence that after telling prison officials about\nhis sensitivity to ETS no change was made in housing\nconditions. This evidence demonstrates deliberate\nindifference on the part of prison officials. See Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 837 (\"[A] prison official cannot be found liable under\nthe Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane\nconditions of confinement unless the official knows of and\ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety\n. . . .\").\n\nB. The Retaliation Claim\n\nAppellee asserts that appellants harassed him in\nretaliation for filing his ETS lawsuit. Appellants contend\nthat they are entitled to qualified immunity.11\n\nWith respect to this claim, the right implicated under the\nfirst prong of the Saucier test for qualified immunity is the\nFirst Amendment right of prisoners to petition the court.\nSee Milhouse v. Carlson, 652 F.2d 371, 373-74 (3d\nCir.1981). In Milhouse, this Court held that a prisoner\nalleging that he was subjected to a series of conspiratorially\nplanned disciplinary actions in retaliation for filing a civil\nrights suit against prison officials stated a cause of action\n\ffor infringement of the prisoner’s First Amendment right.\nId. Here, appellee’s complaint states a similar claim, and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. The basis for their claim is not clear. In their brief, appellants admit\nthat the law regarding retaliation is clearly established: \"It is well-settled\nlaw that correctional officials cannot retaliate against inmates due to the\ninmate’s filing of lawsuits with the court.\" (Appellants’ Br. at 22.)\nAppellants point to evidence and admissions by appellee that contradict\nhis retaliation claims. However, we lack jurisdiction to weigh the\nevidence because the District Court’s determination that the summary\njudgment record in this case raised a genuine issue of material fact was\nnot a final decision as required by 28 U.S.C. S 1291. See Johnson, 515\nU.S. at 313.\n\n                                19\n\n\ntherefore meets the first part of the Saucier test by alleging\na violation of a recognized constitutional right.\n\nAs to the second part of the Saucier inquiry, the Milhouse\nCourt clearly established a prisoner’s right to access the\ncourts so that a reasonable prison official would know that\nhe violates this right if he retaliates against a prisoner for\nfiling a lawsuit. The Milhouse Court stated:\"The right of\naccess to the courts must be ‘adequate, effective and\nmeaningful,’ . . . and must be freely exercisable without\nhindrance or fear of retaliation.\" Id. at 374 (internal citation\nomitted), quoting Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 822\n(1977). In Milhouse, the prisoner alleged that prison officials\nwere violating his rights by preventing him from celebrating\nreligious holidays. Id. at 372. Thereafter, prison officials\nallegedly transferred the prisoner to a less desirable cell\nhouse and committed other acts of revenge against him for\nfiling the lawsuit. Id. Although the District Court dismissed\nthe First Amendment retaliation claim, this Court reversed\nstating: \"If [the prisoner] were able to prove an infringement\nof his first amendment right of access to the courts, he\nwould successfully state a cause of action arising under the\nconstitution.\" Id. at 374.\n\nAppellee has asserted a claim similar to that in Milhouse,\nthat prison officials took retaliatory actions against him for\nfiling a civil rights lawsuit against them. Appellee claims\nthat he was moved to administrative segregation,\nhumiliated by being forced to disrobe unnecessarily, denied\nfood and access to legal materials and advice, and\nthreatened and subdued by the use of excessive force, all in\nrevenge for filing his ETS claim. Milhouse clearly\nestablished that such retaliatory actions, if proven, are not\nlegal. Thus, Saucier’s second prong is satisfied and\nappellants are not entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nC. The Supervisory Appellants\n\nSupervisory appellants Parker, Phelps, Williams, and\nTaylor contend that appellee failed to present evidence\nsufficient to demonstrate personal involvement in or actual\nknowledge by them of the alleged constitutional torts\n\fallegedly committed by appellants Way and Green, and\n\n                                20\n\n\ntherefore that they are entitled to qualified immunity. See\nRode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988)\n(\"A defendant in a civil rights action must have personal\ninvolvement in the alleged wrongs; liability cannot be\npredicated solely on the operation of respondeat superior\n. . . . Personal involvement can be shown through\nallegations of personal direction or of actual knowledge and\nacquiescence . . . .\"). In Rode, a civilian employee of the\nPennsylvania State Police joined Governor Thornburgh and\nState Attorney General Zimmerman as defendants in a\nS 1983 retaliation suit against her superiors. This Court\naffirmed the District Court’s determination that grievances\nfiled with state officials’ offices were insufficient to prove\nactual knowledge and acquiescence by the state officials.\nSee id. at 1208 (\"In a large state employing many\nthousands of employees, a contrary holding would subject\nthe Governor to potential liability in any case in which an\naggrieved employee merely transmitted a complaint to the\nGovernor’s office of administration . . . .\").\n\nAppellants suggest that the deposition and interrogatory\nanswers of a single prisoner are not sufficient to establish\na genuine issue of material fact as to whether the\nsupervisory appellants had actual knowledge of and\nacquiesced in the commission of the alleged constitutional\ntorts. Although appellants couch this argument as one\nrelating to qualified immunity, this is the sort of evidence\nweighing that we cannot entertain given our limited\njurisdiction on this appeal. See Johnson, 515 U.S. at 313.\nIn the present case, the District Court concluded that there\nis sufficient evidence that appellee either wrote or spoke to\neach supervisory defendant regarding both his exposure to\nETS and the retaliatory harassment by appellant Way. We\nlack jurisdiction to evaluate the sufficiency of this evidence.\nSee id.\n\nAlternatively, appellants contend that Rode requires us to\nrule as a matter of law that such correspondences or\nconversations do not constitute sufficient evidence of actual\nknowledge and acquiescence. We, conclude however, that\nRode is factually distinguishable from the present case. The\nGovernor and the Attorney General in that case were much\nfarther removed from the state officials committing the\n\n                                21\n\n\nalleged constitutional torts than the supervisory appellants\nin this case. Here, only Taylor holds a state-wide office.\nMoreover, a governor heads the entire executive branch of\na state’s government; Taylor is charged with oversight of a\nspecific state entity responsible for housing prisoners. The\nscope of his responsibilities are much more narrow than\nthat of a governor or state attorney general, and logically\ndemand more particularized scrutiny of individual\n\fcomplaints. Similarly, the other supervisory appellants have\neven narrower responsibilities as links in a chain of\ncommand within a single prison. We cannot say as a matter\nof law that the supervisory appellants did not have actual\nknowledge when appellee has produced evidence that they\ndid.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe express no view as to whether appellee will be able to\nestablish the objective and subjective elements of his ETS\nclaims or prove his other claims.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court’s\ndenial of appellants’ motion for summary judgment with\nrespect to Atkinson’s ETS and retaliation and excessive\nforce claims. The appeal of the supervisory appellants is\ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                22\n\n\nAMBRO, Circuit Judge, Dissenting in Part:\n\nI agree with my colleagues that appellants are not\nentitled to qualified immunity on Atkinson’s retaliation and\nexcessive force claims, and that we lack jurisdiction to\ndecide whether appellants in supervisory positions are\nentitled to qualified immunity on all claims because they\nlacked notice of the underlying events. I part on but one\nissue. The majority holds that prison officials are not\nentitled to qualified immunity after housing an inmate in a\nprison where he is exposed to second-hand smoke, causing\ndiscomfort somewhere between that of hay fever and the\ncommon cold. Further, the majority calls this conclusion\n\"clearly established\" federal law, meaning that a reasonable\nprison official should have known that we would decide the\ncase this way, even though the circuit courts have reached\nnumerous differing results on this issue and there is no\ncontrolling precedent. The majority misconstrues the\nSupreme Court’s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, and, a\nfortiori, wrongly deems its outcome \"clearly established\" for\npurposes of qualified immunity. I respectfully dissent from\nthe reasoning and holding on this issue.\n\nThe plaintiff in this case has alleged that his exposure to\nsecond-hand cigarette smoke was cruel and unusual\npunishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The\nSupreme Court has recognized that a prisoner may, in the\nright circumstance, bring such a claim in federal court. The\nCourt also recognized, however, that prison officials are\nentitled to qualified immunity from suit unless their actions\nviolated a clearly established constitutional right of the\nplaintiff. Because the record with respect to this issue does\nnot support denying the defendants’ motion for qualified\nimmunity, I would reverse the decision of the District Court\non Atkinson’s Eighth Amendment claim.\n\nQualified Immunity\n\fThe majority states the correct test for qualified immunity\nfrom Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200-01 (2001). We ask\nfirst whether the plaintiff alleges facts that state a\nconstitutional violation. If the answer is yes, we ask\nwhether the right claimed is clearly established, meaning\n\n                                23\n\n\nthat \"it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his\nconduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\" Id. at\n202. Notwithstanding its accurate statement of this test,\nthe majority misapplies it.\n\nI. Step One: Do the Facts Allege an Eighth Amendment\nViolation?\n\nA. The Eighth Amendment Standard\n\nThe Eighth Amendment prohibits punishments\ninconsistent with \"evolving standards of decency that mark\nthe progress of a maturing society.\" Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU.S. 97, 102 (1976) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86,\n101 (1958)). Conditions of prison confinement violate the\nEighth Amendment only if they \"deprive inmates of the\nminimal civilized measure of life’s necessities.\" Rhodes v.\nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981). Thus, for example, a\nprison in which inmates are recruited to serve as armed\nguards, four to eleven inmates are crowded into windowless\n8È x 10È cells during periods of punitive isolation, those\ninmates sleep on floor mattresses infested with hepatitis\nand other infectious diseases, and the inmates receive only\n1,000 calories of \"grue\" to eat each day, violates the Eighth\nAmendment. Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 682-83 (1978).\nOn the other hand, a prison in which inmates have less\nliving space than experts deem appropriate for their\nphysical and mental health, and the prison houses more\ninmates than it was designed to hold, does not violate the\nEighth Amendment. Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 348-49. As the\nSupreme Court has said, \"the Constitution does not\nmandate comfortable prisons.\" Id. at 349.\n\nIn deciding whether a particular condition violates the\nEighth Amendment, we must not look first to our subjective\njudgments. See Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 592 (1977)\n(plurality opinion) (\"Eighth Amendment judgments should\nnot be, or appear to be, merely the subjective views of\nindividual Justices; judgment should be informed by\nobjective factors to the maximum possible extent.\"). The\nbest indication that a condition is \"cruel and unusual\" is a\nconsensus among the state legislatures. See Atkins v.\nVirginia, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 2247 (2002) (\"[T]he ‘clearest and\nmost reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is\n\n                                24\n\n\nthe legislation enacted by the country’s legislatures.’ \")\n(citation omitted). Only where there is a consensus may we\nconsider whether our own judgment tips the balance\n\ftowards finding a constitutional violation. Id. (\"Thus, in\ncases involving a consensus, our own judgment is‘brought\nto bear.’ \") (citation omitted).\n\nSubpar medical care does not automatically violate the\nEighth Amendment. \"Medical malpractice does not become\na constitutional violation merely because the victim is a\nprisoner.\" Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106. To be \"cruel and\nunusual,\" medical care, like other prison conditions, must\ncontravene \"evolving standards of decency.\" Id. Thus, only\n\"acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs\" can violate\nthe Eighth Amendment. Id. This test contains objective and\nsubjective components.\n\nObjectively, the prisoner must present \"serious medical\nneeds.\" A serious medical need is \"one that has been\ndiagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment or one that\nis so obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the\nnecessity for a doctor’s attention.\" Monmouth County Corr.\nInst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 347 (3d Cir. 1987)\n(citation omitted). A medical need is also serious where the\ndenial of treatment would result in the \"unnecessary and\nwanton infliction of pain,\" Estelle, 429 U.S. at 103, or a\n\"life-long handicap or permanent loss,\" Lanzaro, 834 F.2d\nat 347.\n\nSubjectively, prison officials must exhibit \"deliberate\nindifference\" to those needs. Under that standard,\n\n       a prison official cannot be found liable under the\n       Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane\n       conditions of confinement unless the official knows of\n       and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or\n       safety; the official must both be aware of facts from\n       which the inference could be drawn that a substantial\n       risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the\n       inference.\n\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994).\n\nB. Environmental Tobacco Smoke (\"ETS\") Claims\n\nOccasionally prisoners bring Eighth Amendment suits\nalleging that their exposure in prison to second-hand\n\n                                25\n\n\nsmoke, known as environmental tobacco smoke (\"ETS\"),\nconstitutes \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" These ETS\nclaims, as they are called, come in two varieties-- present\ninjury claims and future injury claims -- and are measured\nby different standards. Atkinson’s suit involves both.\n\n       1. Requirements for Present Injury Claims\n\nA present injury claim alleges that exposure to ETS poses\na risk to a prisoner’s existing medical needs. It is a\nstandard condition-of-confinement claim governed by the\n\fprinciples the Supreme Court established in Estelle and\nFarmer. Thus, a prisoner must allege a sufficiently serious\nmedical need (the objective component) and deliberate\nindifference by prison officials in response (the subjective\ncomponent).\n\n       2. Requirements for Future Injury Claims\n\nA future injury claim alleges that an inmate’s ETS\nexposure is creating a risk of future medical harm so grave\nthat society will not condone its prisoners (or anyone else)\nbeing exposed to it. Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 36\n(1994). Helling analyzed only future injury ETS claims.1 An\ninmate whose cellmate smoked five packs of cigarettes a\nday sued under the Eighth Amendment for injunctive relief\nand compensatory damages, alleging that his constant\nexposure to ETS damaged his health. Id. at 28. The\nMagistrate entered a directed verdict for the prison officials.\nHe reasoned that although the plaintiff could hypothetically\nprevail on his claims by showing serious medical needs and\ndeliberate indifference to those needs, he could not support\neither prong with sufficient evidence. The Court of Appeals\nreversed in part, finding that the Magistrate properly\nrejected the present injury claim but should have allowed\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The complaint in Helling alleged present and future injuries, but the\nSupreme Court focused on the future injury claim. See 509 U.S. at 31\n(stating \"the primary question on which certiorari was granted\" to be\n\"whether the court below erred in holding that McKinney had stated an\nEighth Amendment claim on which relief could be granted by alleging\nthat his compelled exposure to ETS poses an unreasonable risk to his\nhealth.\") (emphasis added).\n\n                                26\n\n\nthe plaintiff ’s suit to proceed on the theory that the level of\nETS to which he was exposed posed an intolerable risk to\nhis future health, i.e. a future injury claim. Id. at 28-29.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed. It held that, in theory, a\nprisoner forced to inhale five packs a day of second-hand\nsmoke conceivably might face future health risks\nsufficiently serious to violate the Eighth Amendment. It\nobserved, for example, that in Hutto v. Finney , 437 U.S. at\n682, the high risk that prisoners would eventually contract\nhepatitis and venereal disease from their communal floor\nmats helped to support a finding of an Eighth Amendment\nviolation. Helling, 509 U.S. at 33. Similarly, unreasonably\nhigh ETS levels could create a condition of confinement\nthat \"is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and\nneedless suffering the next week or month or year.\" Id. In\nlight of this possibility, the Court remanded for the District\nCourt to evaluate the plaintiff ’s future injury claim on the\nmerits. Id. at 35 (\"We cannot rule at this juncture that it\nwill be impossible for McKinney, on remand, to prove an\nEighth Amendment violation based on exposure to ETS.\").\n\nHelling established a strict test for Eighth Amendment\n\fETS claims. The Court stated that on remand the plaintiff\nwas required to \"prove both the subjective and objective\nelements necessary to prove an Eighth Amendment\nviolation.\" Id. at 35. As the Court’s opinion reveals, a\nprisoner bears significant burdens in establishing a viable\nclaim, and a district court must undertake a number of\ninquiries to determine whether a plaintiff has produced\nsufficient evidence to support a future injury claim.\n\nAs to the first -- the objective factor -- a plaintiff \"must\nshow that he himself is being exposed to unreasonably high\nlevels of ETS.\" Id. For example, in the circumstances of the\ncase before the Helling Court, \"[p]lainly relevant to this\ndetermination is the fact that [the prisoner] has been moved\n[from one prison to another] and is no longer the cellmate\nof a five-pack-a-day smoker.\" Id. Also, the fact that the\ndirector of the Nevada state prison system subsequently\nhad adopted a formal smoking policy meant that\n\n       [i]t is possible that the new policy will be administered\n       in a way that will minimize the risk to [the prisoner]\n\n                                27\n\n\n       and make it impossible for him to prove that he will be\n       exposed to unreasonable risk with respect to his future\n       health or that he is now entitled to an injunction.\n\nId. at 36. In addition, \"determining whether [the prisoner’s]\nconditions of confinement violate the Eighth Amendment\nrequires more than a scientific and statistical inquiry into\nthe seriousness of the potential harm and the likelihood\nthat such injury to health will actually be caused by\nexposure to ETS.\" Id. Courts must \"assess whether society\nconsiders the risk that the prisoner complains of to be so\ngrave that it violates contemporary standards of decency to\nexpose anyone unwillingly to such a risk.\" Id. Stated\nanother way, \"the prisoner must show that the risk of\nwhich he complains is not one that today’s society chooses\nto tolerate.\" Id.\n\nAs to the second factor -- the subjective factor known as\ndeliberate indifference -- the district court should make its\nconclusions \"in light of the prison authorities’ current\nattitudes and conduct, which may have changed\nconsiderably since the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\"\nId. In Helling, the Supreme Court noted that because\nNevada had adopted a smoking policy for its prisons, this\n\"will bear heavily on the inquiry into deliberate\nindifference,\" possibly making it more difficult to show that\nprison officials are not responding to the dangers of ETS,\nand reducing inmates’ exposure as a result. Finally,\"[t]he\ninquiry into this factor also would be an appropriate vehicle\nto consider arguments regarding the realities of prison\nadministration.\" Id.\n\nC. Application of the Law to Atkinson’s Case\n\nThis case in my view is underwhelming with regard to\n\feither the present or future injury claims.2 Atkinson’s\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The majority repeatedly scolds my dissent for entering the \"forbidden\nterritory\" of evidence-weighing. This assertion is contradicted by the very\nlanguage the majority cites for support. In Ziccardi v. City of\nPhiladelphia, 288 F.3d 57, 61 (3d Cir. 2002), we stated that\n\n       we lack jurisdiction to consider whether the district court correctly\n       identified the set of facts that the summary judgment record is\n       sufficient to prove; but we possess jurisdiction to review whether the\n\n                                28\n\n\nallegations of \"constant\" exposure to ETS for approximately\nseven months theoretically may present a viable claim, but\nthe evidence identified by the District Court is insufficient\nto establish an Eighth Amendment violation. Atkinson\ncannot show that his current condition creates a\"serious\nmedical need,\" or that, following a scientific and statistical\ninquiry, his risk of future harm is \"so grave that it violates\ncontemporary standards of decency to expose anyone\nunwillingly to such a risk.\" Id. at 34, 36.\n\nThe majority decides what conditions society will not\ntolerate in its prisons without considering what society\nitself -- primarily through the decisions of its local\nlegislators and politicians -- has said on the topic. The\nmajority’s attempt to assemble a societal consensus\nconsists of its citing an executive order by the then-\nGovernor of Delaware restricting smoking in some state\nbuildings, but exempting prisons. Del. Exec. Order 71, at\nP 6 (Apr. 4, 1989). Even without the prison exemption, a\nsingle executive order from one state is obviously\ninadequate evidence of a national consensus.3 Moreover, in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       set of facts identified by the district court is sufficient to establish\n       a violation of a clearly established constitutional right.\n\nIn other words, Ziccardi instructs that in cases where the district court\ndenied summary judgment by finding genuine issues of material fact, the\nappeals court does not have jurisdiction to review questions of fact (e.g.,\ndid the plaintiff request, and the defendant refuse, a transfer to a\nnonsmoking cell), but it does have jurisdiction to review questions of law\n(e.g., on the basis of the facts identified by the district court, did the\nplaintiff adequately allege the violation of a clearly established\nconstitutional right).\n\nHere, the District Court concluded that \"genuine issues of material fact\nexist as to: (1) whether Plaintiff was exposed to unreasonably high levels\nof ETS; and (2) whether it is contrary to current standards of decency for\nanyone to be exposed to sufficient environmental tobacco smoke to cause\nthe symptoms Plaintiff suffered.\" The District Court’s findings that the\nlevels of ETS to which Atkinson was exposed may have been both\nunreasonable and contrary to current standards of decency thus fall\nwithin our appellate jurisdiction \"to review whether the set of facts\nidentified by the district court is sufficient to establish a violation of a\nclearly established constitutional right.\"\n\f3. In May 2002 the Delaware General Assembly passed significantly\ntightened restrictions on smoking in public spaces. 16 Del. C. S 2903,\n\n                                 29\n\n\nlight of the prison exemption, the majority’s extrapolation of\nany (let alone a national) consensus is a generous view of\nDelaware’s status as a bellwether of public opinion. 4\n\n       1. Present Injury Claim\n\nAtkinson has failed to present evidence from which a jury\nreasonably could find a serious medical need. His physical\ncondition belies any harm. For example, Atkinson does not\nsuffer asthma attacks in response to ETS.5 He does not\nseem to require medical treatment. Indeed, no doctor has\nordered that Atkinson be placed in a non-smoking area.\n\nFurther undermining Atkinson’s present injury claim is\nthe dearth of medical evidence in his favor. The report from\nAtkinson’s doctor, Dr. Rizzo, is so lacking that it might as\nwell have been written for the defendants. It says that\nAtkinson’s 1995 pituitary surgery, not second-hand smoke,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\namended by 2002 Delaware Laws Ch. 275 (S.B. 99) (effective late\nNovember 2002). It is certainly possible that other states will do the\nsame. According to the Centers for Disease Control, however, as of\nOctober 16, 2002, only California has eliminated smoking from virtually\nall its public places, including bars and restaurants. See Exposure to\nEnvironmental Tobacco Smoke and Cotinine Levels--Fact Sheet, http://\nwww.cdc.gov/tobacco/research_data/environmental/factsheet_ets.htm\n(last visited January 2, 2003). Nevertheless, Delaware’s statute covers\nonly \"any indoor enclosed area to which the general public is invited or\nin which the general public is permitted,\" and therefore clearly not\nprisons. Moreover, the public smoking laws of a few states do not\namount to a national consensus. With regard to the second prong of the\nSaucier test, even if these laws did represent a new national consensus,\nthey do nothing to make that consensus \"clearly established\" in 1998\nand 1999 when the events in this case took place.\n\n4. The majority’s statement in footnote 7 that\"[p]roof of a national\nconsensus might include, inter alia, the federal regulation which protects\nthe public and federal employees from ETS in all federal workplaces\" lays\nout just how speculative the majority’s rationale is. That the District\nCourt might have found evidence of a societal consensus on ETS within\nthe Code of Federal Regulations is not to say that it did.\n\n5. Atkinson does hint that he is asthmatic or that he had \"childhood\nasthma,\" but neither he nor his doctors contend that the evidence could\nsupport a claim that he suffers from asthma now.\n\n                                 30\n\n\ncauses his chronic headaches. It also observes that\nAtkinson smoked for twenty-seven years, and that his\nsymptoms did not change during the year he was isolated\n\ffrom second-hand smoke in prison. It concludes that\nAtkinson has \"symptoms of persistent reactive nasal\npassages and airways based on his response to exposure to\nseasonal changes in temperature and air quality\" and that\nAtkinson’s \"spirometry [lung function] is currently normal.\"\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nThe only statement in the report conceivably supporting\nAtkinson’s claim is Dr. Rizzo’s ambivalent \"impression\" that\n\"it is within reasonable medical probability that symptoms\nof itchy and burning eyes, chest pains, sore throat,\npersistent cough with sputum production, paroxysms of\ncoughing and resultant headaches would all [be]\nprecipitated by exposure to second-hand smoke.\" An\nimpression is not a diagnosis. Even if it were, it is\nunavailing for Atkinson. Not only does the report not\nsuggest that Atkinson’s symptoms constitute \"serious\nmedical needs,\" it does not even say that ETS caused them,\nonly that it is \"within reasonable medical probability\" that\nthese symptoms would be caused by exposure to ETS.\nInstead of \"it is reasonably medically certain\" -- or even \"it\nis reasonably medically probable,\" Dr. Rizzo writes as if it\nis possible that Atkinson’s symptoms fall within the larger\nset of medical probability.\n\nThe affidavit from the prison medical director, Dr. Keith\nIvens, weakens Atkinson’s claim even further. Dr. Ivens\nwrites that Atkinson never complained to him of second-\nhand smoke during several examinations, that Atkinson’s\nsymptoms are consistent with \"seasonal allergies,\" and that\nthey are, in fact, likely caused by allergies because the unit\nwhere he \"has resided for more than the past year (1-F) is\na smoke-free environment.\" Dr. Ivens concludes:\"I can see\nno medical evidence that second-hand smoke is adversely\naffecting the health of Roger Atkinson.\"\n\nFully accepting the District Court’s findings, Atkinson’s\nsymptoms cannot be the predicate for a present injury\nEighth Amendment violation. They are not severe enough to\nconstitute a serious medical need. Every prisoner faces\ndiscomforts in prison that he would rather avoid, but that\n\n                                31\n\n\nnonetheless do not violate the Constitution. See Rhodes,\n452 U.S. at 349.\n\n       2. Future Injury Claim\n\nAtkinson’s future injury claim fares no better. As already\nmentioned, Helling held that a successful ETS claim under\nthe Eighth Amendment must meet two objective criteria. It\nrequires \"more than a scientific and statistical inquiry into\nthe seriousness of the potential harm and the likelihood\nthat such injury to health will actually be caused by\nexposure to ETS.\" 509 U.S. at 36. \"[I]t also requires a court\nto assess whether society considers the risk that the\nprisoner complains of to be so grave that it violates\ncontemporary standards of decency to expose anyone\n\funwillingly to such a risk. In other words, the prisoner\nmust show that the risk of which he complains is not one\nthat today’s society chooses to tolerate.\" Id.\n\nThe District Court’s \"scientific and statistical inquiry\" is\na generic letter from A. Judson Wells, Ph.D., about the\ndangers of ETS. That letter summarizes several recent\nstudies demonstrating a link between second-hand smoke\nand increased risk of heart disease and lung cancer. Those\nstudies have nothing to do with prison settings or with\nAtkinson’s particular case. The letter concludes:\"Overall, I\nwould say that for Mr. Atkinson to continue in a smoke\nfilled cell would increase his risk of death, or non-fatal\nheart attack or stroke. Lung cancer risk develops more\nslowly.\"\n\nThis letter does not satisfy Helling. Dr. Wells did not\nstudy Atkinson himself to determine his particular\nincreased risk of future disease; he merely generalized\nbased on a selected set of studies from medical journals.\nThe Seventh Circuit has specifically rejected the\nsubstitution of generalized medical knowledge for a specific\nmedical examination. See Henderson v. Sheahan , 196 F.3d\n839, 852 (7th Cir. 1999) (\"To avoid having damages\nawarded on the basis of mere speculation or conjecture, it\nonly makes sense that the medical expert should be able to\ntestify to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the\nparticular plaintiff himself faces the increased risk of harm\n\n                                32\n\n\nwhatever that level of risk.\"). Here, when Dr. Wells\nattempted to extrapolate the results of outside studies to\nAtkinson, he did not even venture to suggest a level of\nincreased risk for heart disease or stroke. And his\nprediction for lung cancer risk is even more ambiguous.\nThat risk, he says cryptically, \"develops more slowly.\"\n\nMoreover, Helling requires \"more than a scientific and\nstatistical inquiry into the seriousness of the potential harm\nand the likelihood that such injury to health will actually\nbe caused by exposure to ETS.\" 509 U.S. at 36 (emphasis\nadded). The risk must \"be so grave that it violates\ncontemporary standards of decency to expose anyone\nunwillingly to such a risk.\" Id. Here, we do not know the\nrisk, but even the studies Dr. Wells cites make it obvious\nthat Atkinson is by no means likely to develop heart disease\nor lung cancer because he lived with a smoking cellmate (or\ncellmates) for several months. It thus appears a leap of\nlogic to conclude that society finds this risk to exceed\n\"contemporary standards of decency.\" After all, millions of\npeople not in prison voluntarily tolerate similar levels of\nrisk every day from second-hand smoke and numerous\nother sources. (Indeed, millions more smoke themselves.) In\nthis context, Atkinson cannot state an Eighth Amendment\nclaim based on his risk of future injury caused by ETS.6\n\nAs with the present injury claim, the majority’s analysis\non this issue is unconvincing. The majority says nary a\n\fword about Atkinson’s failure to provide scientific or\nstatistical evidence in support of his claim, as Helling\nexpressly requires. And it offers no reason to believe that\nthe risks to which Atkinson alleges he was exposed are so\ngrave that it violates contemporary standards of decency to\nexpose anyone to them unwillingly.\n\nII. Step Two: Is the Right Clearly Established?\n\nBecause Atkinson does not state an Eighth Amendment\nviolation on either his present injury or future injury\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Because Atkinson cannot satisfy the objective requirements of showing\na serious medical need or an unreasonably grave risk of injury on either\nhis present injury or future injury claims, we do not need to consider\nwhether prison officials demonstrated deliberate indifference.\n\n                                33\n\n\nclaims, we do not have to consider whether his rights under\nthe Eighth Amendment were clearly established. See\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 201 (\"If no constitutional right would\nhave been violated were the allegations established, there is\nno necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified\nimmunity.\"). Nonetheless, the majority’s analysis on this\npoint merits a response.\n\nA right is clearly established if \"it would be clear to a\nreasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the\nsituation he confronted.\" Id. at 202. Qualified immunity\n\"operates ‘to ensure that before they are subjected to suit,\nofficers are on notice their conduct is unlawful.’ \" Hope v.\nPelzer, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2515 (2002) (citation omitted).\nAccordingly, if our Court has not decided a particular\nquestion (which is the case here) and several other courts\nhave reached inconsistent outcomes on relatively similar\nfacts (which is also the case here7), the right at issue\ncannot be clearly established. See Donovan v. City of\nMilwaukee, 17 F.3d 944, 953 (7th Cir. 1994) (\"Because only\ntwo circuits had considered cases on point, reaching\nopposite results, we conclude that ‘the relevant case law\nwas still developing [and] the key issue in this case had not\nbeen clearly settled.’ \") (citation omitted); see also Wilson v.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. The majority cites a number of opinions in support of its assertion\nthat prisoners have a clearly established right to be free from\nunreasonable levels of ETS. In most of these decisions the court made\nlittle effort to determine whether the circumstances represented an\nunacceptable risk to prisoners’ health, presumably because most of the\ncases involved appeals from rulings on motions to dismiss, a much\neasier stage to survive than summary judgment because, unlike\nsummary judgment, motions to dismiss require no evidentiary support\nfor the plaintiffs’ claims. Ultimately, ETS claims for either present or\nfuture injuries rarely succeed unless the exposure is obviously\nintolerable. See, e.g., Richardson v. Spurlock , 260 F.3d 495 (5th Cir.\n2001); Henderson v. Sheahan, 196 F.3d 839 (7th Cir. 1999); Scott v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 139 F.3d 940 (D.C. Cir. 1998); Oliver v. Deen, 77\n\fF.3d 156 (7th Cir. 1996); Mills v. Clark, 229 F.3d 1143, 2000 WL\n1250781 (4th Cir. Sept. 5, 2000) (unpublished). Granted, some of these\ndecisions were appeals from decisions on the merits, not interlocutory\nappeals of qualified immunity determinations. Nevertheless, they\ndemonstrate that many courts have rejected prisoner ETS claims and\nthat plainly the circuits differ in their amenability to these suits.\n\n                                34\n\n\nLayne, 526 U.S. 603, 618 (1999) (\"If judges thus disagree\non a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject police to\nmoney damages for picking the losing side of the\ncontroversy.\"); Rogers v. Pendleton, 249 F.3d 279, 288 (4th\nCir. 2001) (\"[I]f there are no cases of controlling authority in\nthe jurisdiction in question, and if other appellate federal\ncourts have split on the question of whether an asserted\nright exists, the right cannot be clearly established for\nqualified immunity purposes.\").\n\nTo demonstrate that Atkinson’s right to be shielded from\nETS was clearly established, the majority merely invokes\nHelling -- without any accompanying analysis-- and cites\na number of other cases that do the same.8 Saucier\nmandates that the inquiry into whether a right was clearly\nestablished for the purposes of granting qualified immunity\n\"must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the\ncase, not as a broad general proposition; and it too serves\nto advance understanding of the law and to allow officers to\navoid the burden of trial if qualified immunity is\napplicable.\" 533 U.S. at 201. The majority simply passes on\nthe mandatory examination into whether this plaintiff\nunder the circumstances of this case had a clearly\nestablished Eighth Amendment right to not be exposed to\nthis level of ETS. See Mills, 229 F.3d at 1143, 2000 WL\n1250781, at *5 (\"Helling does not guarantee plaintiff a\nsmoke free environment.\").\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. For example, the majority relies primarily on Warren v. Keane, 196\nF.3d 330 (2d Cir. 1999), in which the Second Circuit found that inmates\ncould survive summary judgment on their future injury ETS claim by\nalleging that their confinement \"creates serious long-term health risks.\"\nId. at 332. The cursory, four-page Warren opinion did not consider\nwhether the facts plaintiffs alleged stated an Eighth Amendment\nviolation, did not mention the level of smoke exposure or why that level\nmight be unreasonably high under Helling, and referenced neither the\nrequired \"scientific and statistical inquiry\" nor any support for the\nproposition that society would find the ETS levels in that case --\nwhatever they might have been -- intolerable for its prisoners.\n\nContrary to the majority’s assertion, I do not fail to recognize that\nWarren is factually and procedurally analogous. Warren lacks persuasive\nvalue not because it is distinguishable, but rather because it fails to\nperform the analysis mandated by a prisoner ETS claim.\n\n                                35\n\n\n* * * * *\n\fOn the present injury claim, considering the lack of\nmedical evidence in Atkinson’s favor, no reasonable prison\nofficial could have predicted that Atkinson’s relatively minor\nsymptoms (which appear to have been caused by seasonal\nallergies) would support an Eighth Amendment suit. The\nmajority cites no case to the contrary, and certainly not the\n\"consensus of cases,\" Rogers, 249 F.3d at 287-88, needed\nto overcome qualified immunity.\n\nOn the future injury claim, neither the Supreme Court\nnor any other court has stated that a particular level of ETS\nviolates the Eighth Amendment. Helling did not conclude\nthat the level of ETS exposure in that case -- five packs a\nday in a two-person cell -- was cruel and unusual; the\nSupreme Court remanded for the trial court to make this\ndetermination following a fact-intensive inquiry. Our\njurisdiction is limited to reviewing whether the set of facts\nidentified by the District Court is sufficient to establish a\nviolation of a clearly established constitutional violation.\nThe facts identified by the District Court’s analysis in this\ncase do not.\n\nFor these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                36\n\f",

Appellee, an inmate of the Delaware\nDepartment of Correction, asserted civil rights infractions\nunder 42 U.S.C. S 1983, claiming that appellants 1) violated\nthe Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual\npunishment by exposing him to environmental tobacco\nsmoke (\"ETS\") that created a serious medical need and\nposed an unreasonable risk of harm (Count I) and 2)\nretaliated and used excessive force against him for filing his\nETS lawsuit (Counts III and IV). Appellants1 raise three\nissues on appeal: 1) whether appellants are entitled to\nqualified immunity for the ETS claims; 2) whether\nappellants are entitled to qualified immunity on the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The appellants are Stanley Taylor (Commissioner of the Department of\nCorrection), Warden Raphael Williams, Major Perry Phelps, Sergeant\nPhillip Parker, Correctional Officer Fred Way, and Corporal Andre Green.\nAll ranks are those held by appellants at the time of filing of the\ncomplaint.\n\n                                2\n\n\nretaliation and excessive force claims; and 3) whether\nappellants in supervisory positions are entitled to qualified\nimmunity on all claims because they lacked notice of the\nunderlying events. As to the first two issues, we will affirm\nthe District Court’s denial of summary judgment. We\nconclude that we lack jurisdiction to decide the third issue.\n\nI. BACKGROUND2\n\nAppellee Roger Atkinson is a blind, diabetic prisoner who\nwas housed at Delaware’s Multi-Purpose Criminal Justice\nFacility (\"MPCJF \"). Although a former one-pack-per-day\nsmoker, appellee quit in 1995 after receiving surgery for a\npituitary adenoma.\n\nAtkinson’s ETS claims arise under the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\nHe asserts that from November, 1998, until November,\n1999, appellants subjected him to cruel and unusual\npunishment by exhibiting deliberate indifference to his\nclaims that he was being involuntarily exposed to high\nlevels of second-hand smoke, which forced him to endure\nsevere allergic reactions to ETS and posed an unreasonable\nrisk of future harm to his health. According to his answers\nto interrogatories, during a seven-month incarceration at\nMPCJF he shared a cell with two inmates, each of whom\nsmoked \"constantly\" while in the cell. Appellee shared\nanother cell with a constant smoker for six weeks, and later\nwith a cellmate who smoked ten cigarettes per day.\nAppellee also claims that he has been exposed to other\nsmoking cellmates on various occasions.\n\nShortly after being exposed to ETS and suffering\nsymptoms from it, appellee complained to the medical staff\n\fat MPCJF and Sergeant Sonata. Atkinson alleges that when\nhe tried to seek help at the prison infirmary, the treating\nnurse responded that she was unable to transfer him to a\ncell with a nonsmoking roommate. Although Sonata moved\nappellee to a smoke-free area, Way later returned him to a\nsmoking environment. Thereafter appellee wrote letters to\nWilliams, Captain Lee, Phelps, Parker, and Taylor about his\nexposure to ETS. The exposure did not cease.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. We accept the facts as the District Court stated them in its opinion.\n\n                                3\n\n\nAppellee twice complained to Parker, the supervisor of\nPods 1F and 1E, about his exposure to ETS, but Parker\nrefused to move him to a smoke-free area. Appellee also\ncomplained to Green and requested that he be removed\nfrom exposure but was not moved.\n\nAtkinson’s amended complaint alleges that he was\nexposed, with deliberate indifference, to constant smoking\nin his cell for over seven months and as a result suffered\nnausea, an inability to eat, headaches, chest pains,\ndifficulty breathing, numbness in his limbs, teary eyes,\nitching, burning skin, dizziness, a sore throat, coughing\nand production of sputum. Albert A. Rizzo, M.D., a\npulmonary specialist who examined appellee concluded\nthat there was a \"reasonable medical probability\" that these\nsymptoms were precipitated by second-hand smoke.\nHowever, in an affidavit, prison physician Dr. Keith Ivens\ndisputed Dr. Rizzo’s evaluation and contended that\nAtkinson’s symptoms arose from seasonal allergies. A.\nJudson Wells, Ph.D. stated in an expert report:\"I would say\nthat for Mr. Atkinson to continue in a smoke filled cell\nwould increase his risk of death or non-fatal heart attack or\nstroke.\"\n\nAppellee also asserts that MPCJF officials subjected him\nto a variety of abuses in retaliation for filing his lawsuit. He\ncontends that Way told him that if he had not complained\nabout ETS he would not have been placed in administrative\nsegregation. On repeated occasions, Way read appellee’s\npersonal mail over the prison’s intercom so that other\ninmates could hear it. On or before May 4, 2000, notes\nrelating to appellee’s ETS case were taken from his cell and\nwere read over the intercom by Way and Officer Johnson.\nWay withheld papers that appellee requested from the law\nlibrary. On other occasions, Way refused to permit appellee\nto make telephone calls to his attorney. Way also cursed\nappellee and made derogatory comments about his\nblindness. When appellee asked Way to stop harassing him,\nWay again cursed him and stated that Way was above the\nlaw. Parker was aware of these actions but failed to stop\nthem. Way and Parker placed appellee in solitary\nconfinement during recreation periods, thereby depriving\nhim of the assistance of people able to read his mail or help\n\n                                4\n\fhim with legal work, allegedly for the purpose of preventing\nhim from proceeding with his civil action. On October 5,\n2000, Way prevented appellee from receiving his one hour\nof recreation and falsely wrote in the prison log that he had\nrefused recreation.\n\nAdditionally, appellee either received or was threatened\nwith physical retaliation for filing his lawsuit. In January or\nFebruary of 1999, Way entered appellee’s cell while he was\nsleeping, grabbed him by the leg and pulled appellee from\nhis bed, stating that he thought appellee was dead. On\nMarch 29, 2000, Way threatened to attack appellee and\ntook appellee’s clothing, leaving appellee without clothing\nfor over ten hours. On another occasion, Way entered\nappellee’s cell and threatened to smash his face into the\nwall. Another time, Way stated that he would hang\nappellee. On multiple occasions, Way prevented appellee\nfrom receiving his medications or tampered with his food.\nWay and Parker have threatened appellee and told him that\nhe would never make it to court. Various times Way told\nappellee that Way would \"kick [his] ass,\" that his privileges\nwould be taken away, and that there was nothing that he\ncould do about it. On December 26, 2000, appellee was\nattacked by Green, who struck him in the face and head.\nThis incident was investigated by the FBI, apparently\nbecause of complaints made by appellee’s mother.\nThereafter, Way told appellee over the intercom that he\nwould regret bringing the FBI into the matter and that Way\nwould make him pay. When appellee was leaving an\ninterview room Way ordered appellee to take off his\nclothing. After appellee disrobed, Way kicked his clothing\naround and said that he had to make sure that appellee\nwas not a woman because women were sent to another\nfacility. On December 27, 2000, Green refused to bring\nappellee his breakfast and lunch trays. On February 16,\n2001, when appellee returned from a court appearance, he\nwas strip searched in booking, which is standard\nprocedure. Appellee then returned to Pod 1F and for no\nreason Way made him strip again.\n\nAccording to appellee, he has written to Williams, Phelps,\nTaylor, and Parker, and spoken to Green, about the\nharassment he received from Way.\n\n                                5\n\n\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nReview by this Court is plenary when a denial of qualified\nimmunity turns solely on a question of law. Brown v.\nArmenti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772908\"><a href=\"/opinion/772908/robert-a-brown-v-angelo-armenti-jr-california-university-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72 (3d Cir. 2001). We recently\nreiterated that this Court lacks jurisdiction to evaluate the\nsufficiency of the evidence when reviewing a denial of\nsummary judgment based on a lack of qualified immunity.\nWalker v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777253\"><a href=\"/opinion/777253/michael-tyrone-walker-v-martin-horn-commissioner-of-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 710 (3d Cir. 2002) (\"[W]e\nmust adopt the facts assumed by the District Court.\"); see\nalso Johnson v.

See Ziccardi v. City\nof Philadelphia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777427\"><a href=\"/opinion/777427/joseph-ziccardi-esq-as-administrator-of-the-estate-of-james-smith-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61 (3d. Cir. 2002).\n\nIII. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\n\nIn Saucier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), the Supreme\nCourt explained the two-part inquiry a court must make in\norder to determine whether a state official is entitled to\nqualified immunity:\n\n        A court required to rule upon the qualified immunity\n       issue must consider, then, this threshold question:\n       Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting\n       the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer’s\n       conduct violated a constitutional right? . . .\n\n        If no constitutional right would have been violated\n       were the allegations established, there is no necessity\n       for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity. On\n       the other hand, if a violation could be made out on a\n       favorable view of the parties’ submissions, the next,\n       sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly\n       established.\n\nId. at 201.\n\nTo be clearly established \"[t]he contours of the right must\nbe sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would\n\n                                6\n\n\nunderstand that what he is doing violates that right.\"\nAnderson v. Creighton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640 (1987). The\nSaucier Court further explained the latter prong of the test:\n\n        This inquiry, it is vital to note, must be undertaken\n       in light of the specific context of the case, not as a\n       broad general proposition; and it too serves to advance\n       understanding of the law and to allow officers to avoid\n       the burden of trial if qualified immunity is applicable\n       . . . .\n\n        This is not to say that the formulation of a general\n       rule is beside the point, nor is it to insist the courts\n       must have agreed upon the precise formulation of the\n       standard. Assuming, for instance, that various courts\n       have agreed that certain conduct is a constitutional\n       violation under facts not distinguishable in a fair way\n       from the facts presented in the case at hand, the officer\n       would not be entitled to qualified immunity based\n       simply on the argument that courts had not agreed on\n       one verbal formulation of the controlling standard.\n\fSaucier, 533 U.S. at 201, 203.\n\nA. The ETS claims\n\nAtkinson asserts two separate Eighth Amendment claims\nagainst defendants stemming from his involuntary exposure\nto ETS: 1) a claim for potential future harm arising from his\nexposure to ETS; and 2) a present injury claim stemming\nfrom deliberate indifference to existing medical needs\ncaused by ETS. We will sequentially address whether\ndefendants are entitled to qualified immunity for each\nclaim.\n\n1. Future Injury Claim\n\nWith respect to the future injury claim, Helling v.\nMcKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112888\"><a href=\"/opinion/112888/helling-v-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993), established the\nconstitutional right required by the first prong of the\nSaucier test for qualified immunity. In Helling, the Supreme\nCourt determined that a cause of action exists under the\nEighth Amendment when a prisoner alleges that prison\nofficials have exposed him, with deliberate indifference, to\nlevels of ETS that pose an unreasonable risk of harm to his\n\n                                 7\n\n\nfuture health. Id. at 35 (concluding that prisoner stated a\nclaim where he was forced to share a cell with a five-pack-\nper-day smoker). As to the second part of the Saucier\ninquiry, the Helling Court clearly established the elements\nof a two-part test that a plaintiff must meet to state a valid\nclaim under the Eighth Amendment.\n\nThe Court explained that the first prong of the Helling\ntest is an objective one: \"[The prisoner] must show that he\nhimself is being exposed to unreasonably high levels of\nETS.\" Id. at 35. With respect to the objective factor, the\nCourt noted that beyond a scientific and statistical inquiry\ninto the seriousness of the potential harm and the\nlikelihood that such injury to health will actually be caused\nby exposure to ETS, the Eighth Amendment requires\"a\ncourt to assess whether society considers the risk that the\nprisoner complains of to be so grave that it violates\ncontemporary standards of decency to expose anyone\nunwillingly to such a risk.\" Id. at 36 (emphasis in original).\nThe Court stated: \"In other words, the prisoner must show\nthat the risk of which he complains is not one that today’s\nsociety chooses to tolerate.\" Id.\n\nThe second prong of the Helling test is a subjective one:\nwhether prison officials were deliberately indifferent to a\nserious risk of harm. Id. at 36. The Supreme Court has\nheld that \"a prison official cannot be found liable under the\nEighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane\nconditions of confinement unless the official knows of and\ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the\nofficial must both be aware of facts from which the\ninference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious\nharm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\" Farmer\n\fv. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837 (1994).\n\nIn concluding, the Helling Court held that the prisoner\nhad properly claimed that the level of ETS to which he was\nexposed unreasonably endangered his future health.\nHelling, 509 U.S. at 35. The Court remanded the case so\nthat the prisoner could attempt to prove the objective and\nsubjective elements necessary to establish a violation of the\nEighth Amendment. Id.\n\nSince 1993, almost every Court of Appeals that has\n\n                                8\n\n\naddressed this issue has recognized that a prisoner’s right\nto be free from levels of ETS that pose an unreasonable risk\nof future harm was clearly established by Helling.3 See\nAlvarado v.

The dissent distinguishes ETS cases that survive a motion to dismiss\nfrom those involving a denial of summary judgment by noting that the\nformer require no evidentiary support for a plaintiff ’s claims: \"motions to\ndismiss [are submitted at] a much easier stage to survive than summary\njudgment because, unlike summary judgment, motions to dismiss\nrequire no evidentiary support for the plaintiffs’ claims.\" In making this\nargument the dissent appears to be evaluating the underlying evidence.\nThis is the exercise that Ziccardi forbids us from undertaking on this\nappeal:\n\n       As we understand Johnson, if a defendant in a constitutional tort\n       case moves for summary judgment based on qualified immunity and\n       the district court denies the motion, we lack jurisdiction to consider\n       whether the district court correctly identified the set of facts that the\n       summary judgment record is sufficient to prove; but we possess\n       jurisdiction to review whether the set of facts identified by the\n       district court is sufficient to establish a violation of a clearly\n       established constitutional right.\n\n288 F.3d at 61; see also Sanders v.

The present appeal from appellants’\ndenial of summary judgment, however, is interlocutory in nature and\nbased on a denial of qualified immunity. Because the Supreme Court’s\nruling in Johnson prevents us from weighing the evidence, the present\ncase is more analogous to a 12(b)(6) motion, where we would not\nevaluate the underlying evidence to support the plaintiff ’s claims which\nthe District Court chose to accept.

The Warren\nCourt held that after Helling \"it was clearly established that\nprison officials could violate the Eighth Amendment\nthrough deliberate indifference to an inmate’s exposure to\nlevels of ETS that posed an unreasonable risk of future\nharm to the inmate’s health.\"5Id. Moreover, the Warren\n\fCourt concluded that it would be unreasonable for prison\nofficials to believe that they were not violating the prisoners’\nEighth Amendment rights where the District Court\ndetermined that \"[p]laintiffs’ allegations, if believed,\noverwhelmingly describe a prison environment permeated\nwith smoke resulting from, inter alia, under-enforcement of\ninadequate smoking rules, overcrowding of inmates, and\npoor ventilation.\" Id.\n\nIn the present case, without weighing the underlying\nevidence with respect to Atkinson’s claim, we conclude that\nappellants are not entitled to qualified immunity on the\nETS claim of future harm. As the Warren Court recognized,\nthe Helling decision established the constitutional right\nrequired by the first prong of the Saucier test. Warren, 196\nF.3d at 333; see also Helling, 509 U.S. at 35. Atkinson\ninvokes the constitutional right claimed by the Helling\nprisoner: alleging that he was unwillingly exposed to levels\nof ETS that pose an unreasonable risk of future harm.\n\nSimilarly, Atkinson has satisfied the second prong of the\nSaucier test. The right recognized by the Helling decision is\n\"clearly established\" so that a reasonable prison official\nwould know when he is violating that right. See, e.g.,\nAlvarado, 267 F.3d at 653 (\"Given the decision in Helling,\nthe right of a prisoner to not be subjected to a serious risk\nof his future health resulting from ETS was clearly\nestablished in 1998-99.\"); Warren, 196 F.3d at 333 (\"We\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The dissent characterizes Warren as a cursory opinion lacking\npersuasive value that is not binding on this Court. However, the dissent\nfails to acknowledge that Warren is directly on-point. See Warren, 196\nF.3d at 333 (\"We hold that after Helling, it was clearly established that\nprison officials could violate the Eighth Amendment through deliberate\nindifference to an inmate’s exposure to levels of ETS that posed an\nunreasonable risk of future harm to the inmate’s health.\"). The facts and\nprocedural posture of the Warren decision, a denial of qualified immunity\non summary judgment, are a carbon copy of the present case.\n\n                                11\n\n\nhold that after Helling, it was clearly established that prison\nofficials could violate the Eighth Amendment through\ndeliberate indifference to an inmate’s exposure to levels of\nETS that posed an unreasonable risk of future harm to the\ninmate’s health.\"). The facts of Helling are similar to the\nfacts presented by the appellee. In Helling a prisoner was\nhoused with a five-packs-per-day smoker and complained\nof \"certain health problems.\" Id. at 28. Here, appellee\nAtkinson was housed for over seven months with \"constant\"\nsmokers.\n\nAs to future harm Atkinson has offered some proof for\neach element of the alleged Eighth Amendment violation: 1)\nevidence that he was exposed to unreasonably high levels of\nETS, the risk of which is not one that today’s society\nchooses to tolerate; and 2) evidence that prison officials\nknew of and disregarded an excessive risk to his health or\n\fsafety. As to the first element, appellee’s deposition and\ninterrogatory answers state that he was subjected to\ncontinuous smoking for at least seven months.\nDemonstrating a risk of future harm, A. Judson Wells,\nPh.D. provided statistics and opined in his expert report\nthat \"for Mr. Atkinson to continue in a smoke filled cell\nwould increase his risk of death or non-fatal heart attack or\nstroke.\" With respect to the causal link between ETS and\nappellee’s symptoms, Dr. Rizzo’s letter concluded that there\nwas a \"reasonable medical probability\" that appellee’s\nsymptoms (itchy and burning eyes, chest pains, a sore\nthroat, a persistent cough with sputum production,\nparoxysms of coughing and resulting headaches) were\nprecipitated by second-hand smoke. Although other Courts\nof Appeals have affirmed a grant of summary judgment to\nprison officials on similar evidence as \"too speculative,\"6 we\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. For an example, see Henderson, 196 F.3d at 853. The procedural\nposture of Henderson, an appeal from a grant of summary judgment to\nprison officials for lack of evidence of future harm, allowed the Court of\nAppeals to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence. See id. If appellee can\nproduce evidence of future harm, he may be able to recover monetary\ndamages. See Fontroy, 150 F.3d at 244. However, the problematic\nquantification of those future damages is not relevant to the present\ninquiry concerning whether the underlying constitutional right was\nclearly established so that a reasonable prison official would know that\n\n                                12\n\n\nare deciding the issue of qualified immunity, and cannot\nevaluate the sufficiency of the evidence. See Johnson, 515\nU.S. at 319. In addition, appellee has presented evidence\nthat society has become unwilling to tolerate the imposition\non anyone of continuous unwanted risks of second-hand\nsmoke, citing Executive Order 71, in which the Governor of\nDelaware banned smoking in state buildings except in\ncertain designated areas.7 As to the second Helling element,\ndefendants’ answers to Atkinson’s interrogatories and the\ndepositions of Way, Phelps, and Parker demonstrate that\nappellants knew tobacco smoke was dangerous.\nAdditionally, the District Court relied upon Atkinson’s\nstatements that he either spoke or wrote to all appellants\nregarding unreasonable ETS he was experiencing.\n\n2. Present Injury Claim\n\nAtkinson’s present injury claim for ETS exposure also is\ngrounded in a clearly established constitutional right.\nAlthough Helling dealt only with prisoner’s risk of future\nharm, the Supreme Court clearly established the framework\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nhe subjected appellee to the risk of future harm. Moreover, even if\nappellee is unable to establish a right to compensatory damages, he may\nbe entitled to nominal damages. See Pryer v.

The dissent characterizes this reference as an attempt to form a\nsocietal consensus from a single state regulation. However, we refer to\nthe regulation merely to show that Atkinson has offered some proof of a\nsocietal consensus. Proof of a national consensus might include, inter\nalia, the federal regulation which protects the public and federal\nemployees from ETS in all federal workplaces:\n\n       Pursuant to Executive Order 13058, \"Protecting Federal Employees\n       and the Public From Exposure to Tobacco Smoke in the Federal\n       Workplace\" (3 CFR, 1997 Comp., p. 216), it is the policy of the\n       executive branch to establish a smoke-free environment for Federal\n       employees and members of the public visiting or using Federal\n       facilities. The smoking of tobacco products is prohibited in all\n       interior space owned, rented, or leased by the executive branch of\n       the Federal Government, and in any outdoor areas under executive\n       branch control in front of air intake ducts.\n\n41 CFR S 101-20.105-3(a).\n\n                                13\n\n\nfor analyzing claims of present harm in Estelle v.

See Weaver, 45 F.3d at 1256. In\nWeaver, a case directly on-point, the Court of Appeals for\nthe Eighth Circuit held that Estelle clearly established that\nprison officials could not be deliberately indifferent to a\nprisoner’s existing serious medical needs caused by ETS.\nId. at 1256. In affirming the District Court’s denial of\nqualified immunity to the prison officials the Weaver Court\nstated, \"Such claims were first recognized by the Supreme\nCourt almost two decades ago.\" Id. at 1256.\n\nIn Estelle, the Supreme Court concluded that deliberate\nindifference to serious medical needs of prisoners\nconstitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,\nwhich violates the Eighth Amendment. 429 U.S. at 104.\nThe Estelle Court recognized that even in less serious\ncases, where the prisoner does not experience severe\ntorment or a lingering death, the infliction of unnecessary\nsuffering is inconsistent with standards of decency. See id.\nat 103. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated:\"In order to\nstate a cognizable claim, a prisoner must allege acts or\nomissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate\nindifference to serious medical needs. It is only such\nindifference that can offend ‘evolving standards of decency’\nin violation of the Eighth Amendment.\" Id. at 106.\n\nAtkinson has alleged a serious medical need to which\nappellants were deliberately indifferent.

See id.\n\nIn Weaver, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\nspecifically recognized that severe headaches, dizziness,\nnausea, vomiting, and breathing difficulties stemming from\nexposure to ETS constituted a serious medical need, which\nrequired removal of the prisoner from a smoking\nenvironment under the Eighth Amendment. Id. at 1254.\nSimilarly, other Courts of Appeals have recognized that an\nillness arising from an inmate’s exposure to ETS can\nconstitute a serious medical condition. See, e.g., Alvarado,\n267 F.3d at 651 (\"[Prisoner]’s complaint stated an Eighth\nAmendment claim when he alleged that because of the\nprison officials’ deliberate indifference, he was being\nexposed to levels of ETS which aggravated his chronic\nasthma, thereby endangering his existing health, a claim\nrecognized as an Eighth Amendment violation twenty-five\nyears ago in Estelle v.

The dissent points out that the Seventh Circuit decisions of Henderson\nand Oliver rejected present injury claims similar to Atkinson’s because\nthe prisoners in those cases were unable to prove that their medical\nneeds were sufficiently serious.

Moreover, the Oliver Court did not conclude that\nsuch symptoms were insufficiently serious as a matter of law. See Oliver,\n77 F.3d at 161 (\"On this record, Oliver has not demonstrated that he\nwas subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.\"). As the dissent in\nOliver clearly explained, the entire panel agreed that the prisoner’s\nallegations (which are similar to Atkinson’s) satisfied the requirements of\nEstelle:\n\n       No one disputes that Oliver’s allegations were enough to satisfy\n       Estelle v.

Atkinson has fulfilled Saucier’s first\nprong for denying qualified immunity by alleging a violation\nof a clearly established constitutional right. As both the\nWeaver and Alvarado Courts point out the Constitutional\nright alleged by Atkinson was established over two decades\nago by the Supreme Court in Estelle. See Alvarado, 267\nF.3d at 651; Weaver, 45 F.3d at 1256. Atkinson’s amended\ncomplaint alleges that he was exposed, with deliberate\nindifference, to constant smoking in his cell for over seven\nmonths and as a result suffered nausea, an inability to eat,\nheadaches, chest pains, difficulty breathing, numbness in\nhis limbs, teary eyes, itching, burning skin, dizziness, a\nsore throat, coughing and production of sputum. The\ndissent describes these symptoms as \"causing discomfort\nsomewhere between that of hay fever and the common cold\"\nand notes that \"millions of people not in prison voluntarily\ntolerate similar levels of risk every day from second-hand\nsmoke and numerous other sources.\" However, unlike\nindividuals who voluntarily expose themselves to ETS, a\nprisoner cannot simply walk out of his cell whenever he\nwishes. When a susceptible prisoner is confined to a cell, a\nsmall and confined space, with a \"constant\" smoker for an\nextended period of time, such symptoms may transform\nwhat would otherwise be a passing annoyance into a\nserious ongoing medical need. Additionally, Atkinson has\nfulfilled the second prong of Saucier’s test by demonstrating\nthat the constitutional right was clearly established by the\nHunt, Weaver and Estelle Courts on or before his own claim\n\n                                17\n\n\narose in 1998-1999. See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104 (\"We\ntherefore conclude that deliberate indifference to serious\nmedical needs of prisoners constitutes the ‘unnecessary\nand wanton infliction of pain,’ . . . proscribed by the Eighth\nAmendment.\"); Weaver, 45 F.3d at 1256 (recognizing that\nsevere headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and\nbreathing difficulties stemming from exposure to ETS\nconstitutes a serious medical need, which requires removal\nof the prisoner from a smoking environment under the\nEighth Amendment); Hunt, 974 F.2d 735-36 (concluding\nprisoner could state a present injury claim for ETS\nexposure); see also Alvarado, 267 F.3d at 651-52\n(\"[Prisoner]’s complaint stated an Eighth Amendment claim\nwhen he alleged that because of the prison officials’\ndeliberate indifference, he was being exposed to levels of\nETS which aggravated his chronic asthma, thereby\nendangering his existing health, a claim recognized as an\nEighth Amendment violation twenty-five years ago in Estelle\nv.

Although Alvarado postdates the time when Atkinson’s cause of action\naccrued, we cite to that case to demonstrate that, as the Court of\nAppeals for the Seventh Circuit recognized, the constitutional right\nwhich Atkinson asserts was clearly established over twenty-five years ago\nin Estelle.\n\n10. The dissent contends that Dr. Rizzo’s affidavit undermines Atkinson’s\nclaim. Aside from the matter that the dissent is weighing the evidence\nsupporting the District Court’s determination in contravention of\nZiccardi, the dissent misconstrues Dr. Rizzo’s statements. Dr. Rizzo\nnoted the following:\n\n       Roger Atkinson is a former cigarette smoker who was diagnosed\n       with childhood asthma and may have symptoms of persistent\n       reactive nasal passages and airways based on his response to\n       exposure to seasonal changes in temperature and air quality. His\n       spirometry is currently normal, but this does not preclude the\n       presence of airway sensitivity.\n\n(A. 127). If anything, this notation supports Atkinson’s claim that he is\nparticularly sensitized to air quality and that ETS seriously exacerbates\nhis underlying condition. The dissent also points out that the affidavit of\nDr. Keith Ivens weakens Atkinson’s claim. This, however, takes this\nCourt into the forbidden territory of evidence weighing.\n\n                                18\n\n\nDistrict Court found that deliberate indifference to these\nalleged symptoms constituted a violation of clearly\nestablished law, and we agree. Atkinson alleges that when\nhe tried to seek help at the prison infirmary the treating\nnurse responded that she was unable to transfer him to a\ncell with a nonsmoking roommate. Similarly, Atkinson has\nproduced evidence that after telling prison officials about\nhis sensitivity to ETS no change was made in housing\nconditions. This evidence demonstrates deliberate\nindifference on the part of prison officials. See Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 837 (\"[A] prison official cannot be found liable under\nthe Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane\nconditions of confinement unless the official knows of and\ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety\n. . . .\").\n\nB. The Retaliation Claim\n\nAppellee asserts that appellants harassed him in\nretaliation for filing his ETS lawsuit. Appellants contend\nthat they are entitled to qualified immunity.11\n\nWith respect to this claim, the right implicated under the\nfirst prong of the Saucier test for qualified immunity is the\nFirst Amendment right of prisoners to petition the court.\nSee Milhouse v. Carlson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391852\"><a href=\"/opinion/391852/milhouse-lester-d-aka-milhouse-bey-lester-d-v-carlson-norman-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373-74 (3d\nCir.1981). In Milhouse, this Court held that a prisoner\nalleging that he was subjected to a series of conspiratorially\nplanned disciplinary actions in retaliation for filing a civil\nrights suit against prison officials stated a cause of action\n\ffor infringement of the prisoner’s First Amendment right.\nId. Here, appellee’s complaint states a similar claim, and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. The basis for their claim is not clear. In their brief, appellants admit\nthat the law regarding retaliation is clearly established: \"It is well-settled\nlaw that correctional officials cannot retaliate against inmates due to the\ninmate’s filing of lawsuits with the court.\" (Appellants’ Br. at 22.)\nAppellants point to evidence and admissions by appellee that contradict\nhis retaliation claims. However, we lack jurisdiction to weigh the\nevidence because the District Court’s determination that the summary\njudgment record in this case raised a genuine issue of material fact was\nnot a final decision as required by 28 U.S.C. S 1291. See Johnson, 515\nU.S. at 313.\n\n                                19\n\n\ntherefore meets the first part of the Saucier test by alleging\na violation of a recognized constitutional right.\n\nAs to the second part of the Saucier inquiry, the Milhouse\nCourt clearly established a prisoner’s right to access the\ncourts so that a reasonable prison official would know that\nhe violates this right if he retaliates against a prisoner for\nfiling a lawsuit. The Milhouse Court stated:\"The right of\naccess to the courts must be ‘adequate, effective and\nmeaningful,’ . . . and must be freely exercisable without\nhindrance or fear of retaliation.\" Id. at 374 (internal citation\nomitted), quoting Bounds v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109643\"><a href=\"/opinion/109643/bounds-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822\n(1977). In Milhouse, the prisoner alleged that prison officials\nwere violating his rights by preventing him from celebrating\nreligious holidays. Id. at 372. Thereafter, prison officials\nallegedly transferred the prisoner to a less desirable cell\nhouse and committed other acts of revenge against him for\nfiling the lawsuit. Id. Although the District Court dismissed\nthe First Amendment retaliation claim, this Court reversed\nstating: \"If [the prisoner] were able to prove an infringement\nof his first amendment right of access to the courts, he\nwould successfully state a cause of action arising under the\nconstitution.\" Id. at 374.\n\nAppellee has asserted a claim similar to that in Milhouse,\nthat prison officials took retaliatory actions against him for\nfiling a civil rights lawsuit against them. Appellee claims\nthat he was moved to administrative segregation,\nhumiliated by being forced to disrobe unnecessarily, denied\nfood and access to legal materials and advice, and\nthreatened and subdued by the use of excessive force, all in\nrevenge for filing his ETS claim. Milhouse clearly\nestablished that such retaliatory actions, if proven, are not\nlegal. Thus, Saucier’s second prong is satisfied and\nappellants are not entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nC. The Supervisory Appellants\n\nSupervisory appellants Parker, Phelps, Williams, and\nTaylor contend that appellee failed to present evidence\nsufficient to demonstrate personal involvement in or actual\nknowledge by them of the alleged constitutional torts\n\fallegedly committed by appellants Way and Green, and\n\n                                20\n\n\ntherefore that they are entitled to qualified immunity. See\nRode v. Dellarciprete, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505504\"><a href=\"/opinion/505504/vivian-m-rode-and-jay-c-hileman-v-nicholas-g-dellarciprete-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988)\n(\"A defendant in a civil rights action must have personal\ninvolvement in the alleged wrongs; liability cannot be\npredicated solely on the operation of respondeat superior\n. . . . Personal involvement can be shown through\nallegations of personal direction or of actual knowledge and\nacquiescence . . . .\"). In Rode, a civilian employee of the\nPennsylvania State Police joined Governor Thornburgh and\nState Attorney General Zimmerman as defendants in a\nS 1983 retaliation suit against her superiors. This Court\naffirmed the District Court’s determination that grievances\nfiled with state officials’ offices were insufficient to prove\nactual knowledge and acquiescence by the state officials.\nSee id. at 1208 (\"In a large state employing many\nthousands of employees, a contrary holding would subject\nthe Governor to potential liability in any case in which an\naggrieved employee merely transmitted a complaint to the\nGovernor’s office of administration . . . .\").\n\nAppellants suggest that the deposition and interrogatory\nanswers of a single prisoner are not sufficient to establish\na genuine issue of material fact as to whether the\nsupervisory appellants had actual knowledge of and\nacquiesced in the commission of the alleged constitutional\ntorts. Although appellants couch this argument as one\nrelating to qualified immunity, this is the sort of evidence\nweighing that we cannot entertain given our limited\njurisdiction on this appeal. See Johnson, 515 U.S. at 313.\nIn the present case, the District Court concluded that there\nis sufficient evidence that appellee either wrote or spoke to\neach supervisory defendant regarding both his exposure to\nETS and the retaliatory harassment by appellant Way. We\nlack jurisdiction to evaluate the sufficiency of this evidence.\nSee id.\n\nAlternatively, appellants contend that Rode requires us to\nrule as a matter of law that such correspondences or\nconversations do not constitute sufficient evidence of actual\nknowledge and acquiescence. We, conclude however, that\nRode is factually distinguishable from the present case. The\nGovernor and the Attorney General in that case were much\nfarther removed from the state officials committing the\n\n                                21\n\n\nalleged constitutional torts than the supervisory appellants\nin this case. Here, only Taylor holds a state-wide office.\nMoreover, a governor heads the entire executive branch of\na state’s government; Taylor is charged with oversight of a\nspecific state entity responsible for housing prisoners. The\nscope of his responsibilities are much more narrow than\nthat of a governor or state attorney general, and logically\ndemand more particularized scrutiny of individual\n\fcomplaints. Similarly, the other supervisory appellants have\neven narrower responsibilities as links in a chain of\ncommand within a single prison. We cannot say as a matter\nof law that the supervisory appellants did not have actual\nknowledge when appellee has produced evidence that they\ndid.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe express no view as to whether appellee will be able to\nestablish the objective and subjective elements of his ETS\nclaims or prove his other claims.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court’s\ndenial of appellants’ motion for summary judgment with\nrespect to Atkinson’s ETS and retaliation and excessive\nforce claims. The appeal of the supervisory appellants is\ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                22\n\n\nAMBRO, Circuit Judge, Dissenting in Part:\n\nI agree with my colleagues that appellants are not\nentitled to qualified immunity on Atkinson’s retaliation and\nexcessive force claims, and that we lack jurisdiction to\ndecide whether appellants in supervisory positions are\nentitled to qualified immunity on all claims because they\nlacked notice of the underlying events. I part on but one\nissue. The majority holds that prison officials are not\nentitled to qualified immunity after housing an inmate in a\nprison where he is exposed to second-hand smoke, causing\ndiscomfort somewhere between that of hay fever and the\ncommon cold. Further, the majority calls this conclusion\n\"clearly established\" federal law, meaning that a reasonable\nprison official should have known that we would decide the\ncase this way, even though the circuit courts have reached\nnumerous differing results on this issue and there is no\ncontrolling precedent. The majority misconstrues the\nSupreme Court’s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, and, a\nfortiori, wrongly deems its outcome \"clearly established\" for\npurposes of qualified immunity. I respectfully dissent from\nthe reasoning and holding on this issue.\n\nThe plaintiff in this case has alleged that his exposure to\nsecond-hand cigarette smoke was cruel and unusual\npunishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The\nSupreme Court has recognized that a prisoner may, in the\nright circumstance, bring such a claim in federal court. The\nCourt also recognized, however, that prison officials are\nentitled to qualified immunity from suit unless their actions\nviolated a clearly established constitutional right of the\nplaintiff. Because the record with respect to this issue does\nnot support denying the defendants’ motion for qualified\nimmunity, I would reverse the decision of the District Court\non Atkinson’s Eighth Amendment claim.\n\nQualified Immunity\n\fThe majority states the correct test for qualified immunity\nfrom Saucier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200-01 (2001). We ask\nfirst whether the plaintiff alleges facts that state a\nconstitutional violation. If the answer is yes, we ask\nwhether the right claimed is clearly established, meaning\n\n                                23\n\n\nthat \"it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his\nconduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\" Id. at\n202. Notwithstanding its accurate statement of this test,\nthe majority misapplies it.\n\nI. Step One: Do the Facts Allege an Eighth Amendment\nViolation?\n\nA.

As the\nSupreme Court has said, \"the Constitution does not\nmandate comfortable prisons.\" Id. at 349.\n\nIn deciding whether a particular condition violates the\nEighth Amendment, we must not look first to our subjective\njudgments.

Environmental Tobacco Smoke (\"ETS\") Claims\n\nOccasionally prisoners bring Eighth Amendment suits\nalleging that their exposure in prison to second-hand\n\n                                25\n\n\nsmoke, known as environmental tobacco smoke (\"ETS\"),\nconstitutes \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" These ETS\nclaims, as they are called, come in two varieties-- present\ninjury claims and future injury claims -- and are measured\nby different standards. Atkinson’s suit involves both.\n\n       1. Requirements for Present Injury Claims\n\nA present injury claim alleges that exposure to ETS poses\na risk to a prisoner’s existing medical needs. It is a\nstandard condition-of-confinement claim governed by the\n\fprinciples the Supreme Court established in Estelle and\nFarmer. Thus, a prisoner must allege a sufficiently serious\nmedical need (the objective component) and deliberate\nindifference by prison officials in response (the subjective\ncomponent).\n\n       2. Requirements for Future Injury Claims\n\nA future injury claim alleges that an inmate’s ETS\nexposure is creating a risk of future medical harm so grave\nthat society will not condone its prisoners (or anyone else)\nbeing exposed to it. Helling v. McKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112888\"><a href=\"/opinion/112888/helling-v-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36\n(1994). Helling analyzed only future injury ETS claims.1 An\ninmate whose cellmate smoked five packs of cigarettes a\nday sued under the Eighth Amendment for injunctive relief\nand compensatory damages, alleging that his constant\nexposure to ETS damaged his health. Id. at 28. The\nMagistrate entered a directed verdict for the prison officials.\nHe reasoned that although the plaintiff could hypothetically\nprevail on his claims by showing serious medical needs and\ndeliberate indifference to those needs, he could not support\neither prong with sufficient evidence. The Court of Appeals\nreversed in part, finding that the Magistrate properly\nrejected the present injury claim but should have allowed\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The complaint in Helling alleged present and future injuries, but the\nSupreme Court focused on the future injury claim. See 509 U.S. at 31\n(stating \"the primary question on which certiorari was granted\" to be\n\"whether the court below erred in holding that McKinney had stated an\nEighth Amendment claim on which relief could be granted by alleging\nthat his compelled exposure to ETS poses an unreasonable risk to his\nhealth.\") (emphasis added).\n\n                                26\n\n\nthe plaintiff ’s suit to proceed on the theory that the level of\nETS to which he was exposed posed an intolerable risk to\nhis future health, i.e. a future injury claim. Id. at 28-29.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed. It held that, in theory, a\nprisoner forced to inhale five packs a day of second-hand\nsmoke conceivably might face future health risks\nsufficiently serious to violate the Eighth Amendment. It\nobserved, for example, that in Hutto v. Finney , 437 U.S. at\n682, the high risk that prisoners would eventually contract\nhepatitis and venereal disease from their communal floor\nmats helped to support a finding of an Eighth Amendment\nviolation. Helling, 509 U.S. at 33. Similarly, unreasonably\nhigh ETS levels could create a condition of confinement\nthat \"is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and\nneedless suffering the next week or month or year.\" Id. In\nlight of this possibility, the Court remanded for the District\nCourt to evaluate the plaintiff ’s future injury claim on the\nmerits. Id. at 35 (\"We cannot rule at this juncture that it\nwill be impossible for McKinney, on remand, to prove an\nEighth Amendment violation based on exposure to ETS.\").\n\nHelling established a strict test for Eighth Amendment\n\fETS claims. The Court stated that on remand the plaintiff\nwas required to \"prove both the subjective and objective\nelements necessary to prove an Eighth Amendment\nviolation.\" Id. at 35. As the Court’s opinion reveals, a\nprisoner bears significant burdens in establishing a viable\nclaim, and a district court must undertake a number of\ninquiries to determine whether a plaintiff has produced\nsufficient evidence to support a future injury claim.\n\nAs to the first -- the objective factor -- a plaintiff \"must\nshow that he himself is being exposed to unreasonably high\nlevels of ETS.\" Id. For example, in the circumstances of the\ncase before the Helling Court, \"[p]lainly relevant to this\ndetermination is the fact that [the prisoner] has been moved\n[from one prison to another] and is no longer the cellmate\nof a five-pack-a-day smoker.\" Id. Also, the fact that the\ndirector of the Nevada state prison system subsequently\nhad adopted a formal smoking policy meant that\n\n       [i]t is possible that the new policy will be administered\n       in a way that will minimize the risk to [the prisoner]\n\n                                27\n\n\n       and make it impossible for him to prove that he will be\n       exposed to unreasonable risk with respect to his future\n       health or that he is now entitled to an injunction.\n\nId. at 36. In addition, \"determining whether [the prisoner’s]\nconditions of confinement violate the Eighth Amendment\nrequires more than a scientific and statistical inquiry into\nthe seriousness of the potential harm and the likelihood\nthat such injury to health will actually be caused by\nexposure to ETS.\" Id. Courts must \"assess whether society\nconsiders the risk that the prisoner complains of to be so\ngrave that it violates contemporary standards of decency to\nexpose anyone unwillingly to such a risk.\" Id. Stated\nanother way, \"the prisoner must show that the risk of\nwhich he complains is not one that today’s society chooses\nto tolerate.\" Id.\n\nAs to the second factor -- the subjective factor known as\ndeliberate indifference -- the district court should make its\nconclusions \"in light of the prison authorities’ current\nattitudes and conduct, which may have changed\nconsiderably since the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\"\nId. In Helling, the Supreme Court noted that because\nNevada had adopted a smoking policy for its prisons, this\n\"will bear heavily on the inquiry into deliberate\nindifference,\" possibly making it more difficult to show that\nprison officials are not responding to the dangers of ETS,\nand reducing inmates’ exposure as a result. Finally,\"[t]he\ninquiry into this factor also would be an appropriate vehicle\nto consider arguments regarding the realities of prison\nadministration.\" Id.\n\nC. Application of the Law to Atkinson’s Case\n\nThis case in my view is underwhelming with regard to\n\feither the present or future injury claims.2 Atkinson’s\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The majority repeatedly scolds my dissent for entering the \"forbidden\nterritory\" of evidence-weighing. This assertion is contradicted by the very\nlanguage the majority cites for support. In Ziccardi v. City of\nPhiladelphia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777427\"><a href=\"/opinion/777427/joseph-ziccardi-esq-as-administrator-of-the-estate-of-james-smith-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61 (3d Cir. 2002), we stated that\n\n       we lack jurisdiction to consider whether the district court correctly\n       identified the set of facts that the summary judgment record is\n       sufficient to prove; but we possess jurisdiction to review whether the\n\n                                28\n\n\nallegations of \"constant\" exposure to ETS for approximately\nseven months theoretically may present a viable claim, but\nthe evidence identified by the District Court is insufficient\nto establish an Eighth Amendment violation. Atkinson\ncannot show that his current condition creates a\"serious\nmedical need,\" or that, following a scientific and statistical\ninquiry, his risk of future harm is \"so grave that it violates\ncontemporary standards of decency to expose anyone\nunwillingly to such a risk.\" Id. at 34, 36.\n\nThe majority decides what conditions society will not\ntolerate in its prisons without considering what society\nitself -- primarily through the decisions of its local\nlegislators and politicians -- has said on the topic. The\nmajority’s attempt to assemble a societal consensus\nconsists of its citing an executive order by the then-\nGovernor of Delaware restricting smoking in some state\nbuildings, but exempting prisons. Del. Exec. Order 71, at\nP 6 (Apr. 4, 1989). Even without the prison exemption, a\nsingle executive order from one state is obviously\ninadequate evidence of a national consensus.3 Moreover, in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       set of facts identified by the district court is sufficient to establish\n       a violation of a clearly established constitutional right.\n\nIn other words, Ziccardi instructs that in cases where the district court\ndenied summary judgment by finding genuine issues of material fact, the\nappeals court does not have jurisdiction to review questions of fact (e.g.,\ndid the plaintiff request, and the defendant refuse, a transfer to a\nnonsmoking cell), but it does have jurisdiction to review questions of law\n(e.g., on the basis of the facts identified by the district court, did the\nplaintiff adequately allege the violation of a clearly established\nconstitutional right).\n\nHere, the District Court concluded that \"genuine issues of material fact\nexist as to: (1) whether Plaintiff was exposed to unreasonably high levels\nof ETS; and (2) whether it is contrary to current standards of decency for\nanyone to be exposed to sufficient environmental tobacco smoke to cause\nthe symptoms Plaintiff suffered.\" The District Court’s findings that the\nlevels of ETS to which Atkinson was exposed may have been both\nunreasonable and contrary to current standards of decency thus fall\nwithin our appellate jurisdiction \"to review whether the set of facts\nidentified by the district court is sufficient to establish a violation of a\nclearly established constitutional right.\"\n\f3. In May 2002 the Delaware General Assembly passed significantly\ntightened restrictions on smoking in public spaces. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. S 2903,\n\n                                 29\n\n\nlight of the prison exemption, the majority’s extrapolation of\nany (let alone a national) consensus is a generous view of\nDelaware’s status as a bellwether of public opinion. 4\n\n       1. Present Injury Claim\n\nAtkinson has failed to present evidence from which a jury\nreasonably could find a serious medical need. His physical\ncondition belies any harm. For example, Atkinson does not\nsuffer asthma attacks in response to ETS.5 He does not\nseem to require medical treatment. Indeed, no doctor has\nordered that Atkinson be placed in a non-smoking area.\n\nFurther undermining Atkinson’s present injury claim is\nthe dearth of medical evidence in his favor. The report from\nAtkinson’s doctor, Dr. Rizzo, is so lacking that it might as\nwell have been written for the defendants. It says that\nAtkinson’s 1995 pituitary surgery, not second-hand smoke,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\namended by 2002 Delaware Laws Ch. 275 (S.B. 99) (effective late\nNovember 2002). It is certainly possible that other states will do the\nsame. According to the Centers for Disease Control, however, as of\nOctober 16, 2002, only California has eliminated smoking from virtually\nall its public places, including bars and restaurants. See Exposure to\nEnvironmental Tobacco Smoke and Cotinine Levels--Fact Sheet, http://\nwww.cdc.gov/tobacco/research_data/environmental/factsheet_ets.htm\n(last visited January 2, 2003). Nevertheless, Delaware’s statute covers\nonly \"any indoor enclosed area to which the general public is invited or\nin which the general public is permitted,\" and therefore clearly not\nprisons. Moreover, the public smoking laws of a few states do not\namount to a national consensus. With regard to the second prong of the\nSaucier test, even if these laws did represent a new national consensus,\nthey do nothing to make that consensus \"clearly established\" in 1998\nand 1999 when the events in this case took place.\n\n4. The majority’s statement in footnote 7 that\"[p]roof of a national\nconsensus might include, inter alia, the federal regulation which protects\nthe public and federal employees from ETS in all federal workplaces\" lays\nout just how speculative the majority’s rationale is. That the District\nCourt might have found evidence of a societal consensus on ETS within\nthe Code of Federal Regulations is not to say that it did.\n\n5. Atkinson does hint that he is asthmatic or that he had \"childhood\nasthma,\" but neither he nor his doctors contend that the evidence could\nsupport a claim that he suffers from asthma now.\n\n                                 30\n\n\ncauses his chronic headaches. It also observes that\nAtkinson smoked for twenty-seven years, and that his\nsymptoms did not change during the year he was isolated\n\ffrom second-hand smoke in prison. It concludes that\nAtkinson has \"symptoms of persistent reactive nasal\npassages and airways based on his response to exposure to\nseasonal changes in temperature and air quality\" and that\nAtkinson’s \"spirometry [lung function] is currently normal.\"\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nThe only statement in the report conceivably supporting\nAtkinson’s claim is Dr. Rizzo’s ambivalent \"impression\" that\n\"it is within reasonable medical probability that symptoms\nof itchy and burning eyes, chest pains, sore throat,\npersistent cough with sputum production, paroxysms of\ncoughing and resultant headaches would all [be]\nprecipitated by exposure to second-hand smoke.\" An\nimpression is not a diagnosis. Even if it were, it is\nunavailing for Atkinson. Not only does the report not\nsuggest that Atkinson’s symptoms constitute \"serious\nmedical needs,\" it does not even say that ETS caused them,\nonly that it is \"within reasonable medical probability\" that\nthese symptoms would be caused by exposure to ETS.\nInstead of \"it is reasonably medically certain\" -- or even \"it\nis reasonably medically probable,\" Dr. Rizzo writes as if it\nis possible that Atkinson’s symptoms fall within the larger\nset of medical probability.\n\nThe affidavit from the prison medical director, Dr. Keith\nIvens, weakens Atkinson’s claim even further. Dr. Ivens\nwrites that Atkinson never complained to him of second-\nhand smoke during several examinations, that Atkinson’s\nsymptoms are consistent with \"seasonal allergies,\" and that\nthey are, in fact, likely caused by allergies because the unit\nwhere he \"has resided for more than the past year (1-F) is\na smoke-free environment.\" Dr. Ivens concludes:\"I can see\nno medical evidence that second-hand smoke is adversely\naffecting the health of Roger Atkinson.\"\n\nFully accepting the District Court’s findings, Atkinson’s\nsymptoms cannot be the predicate for a present injury\nEighth Amendment violation. They are not severe enough to\nconstitute a serious medical need. Every prisoner faces\ndiscomforts in prison that he would rather avoid, but that\n\n                                31\n\n\nnonetheless do not violate the Constitution. See Rhodes,\n452 U.S. at 349.\n\n       2. Future Injury Claim\n\nAtkinson’s future injury claim fares no better. As already\nmentioned, Helling held that a successful ETS claim under\nthe Eighth Amendment must meet two objective criteria. It\nrequires \"more than a scientific and statistical inquiry into\nthe seriousness of the potential harm and the likelihood\nthat such injury to health will actually be caused by\nexposure to ETS.\" 509 U.S. at 36. \"[I]t also requires a court\nto assess whether society considers the risk that the\nprisoner complains of to be so grave that it violates\ncontemporary standards of decency to expose anyone\n\funwillingly to such a risk. In other words, the prisoner\nmust show that the risk of which he complains is not one\nthat today’s society chooses to tolerate.\" Id.\n\nThe District Court’s \"scientific and statistical inquiry\" is\na generic letter from A. Judson Wells, Ph.D., about the\ndangers of ETS. That letter summarizes several recent\nstudies demonstrating a link between second-hand smoke\nand increased risk of heart disease and lung cancer. Those\nstudies have nothing to do with prison settings or with\nAtkinson’s particular case. The letter concludes:\"Overall, I\nwould say that for Mr. Atkinson to continue in a smoke\nfilled cell would increase his risk of death, or non-fatal\nheart attack or stroke. Lung cancer risk develops more\nslowly.\"\n\nThis letter does not satisfy Helling. Dr. Wells did not\nstudy Atkinson himself to determine his particular\nincreased risk of future disease; he merely generalized\nbased on a selected set of studies from medical journals.\nThe Seventh Circuit has specifically rejected the\nsubstitution of generalized medical knowledge for a specific\nmedical examination. See Henderson v. Sheahan , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766785\"><a href=\"/opinion/766785/ellis-henderson-v-michael-f-sheahan-and-jw-fairman/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 852 (7th Cir. 1999) (\"To avoid having damages\nawarded on the basis of mere speculation or conjecture, it\nonly makes sense that the medical expert should be able to\ntestify to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the\nparticular plaintiff himself faces the increased risk of harm\n\n                                32\n\n\nwhatever that level of risk.\"). Here, when Dr. Wells\nattempted to extrapolate the results of outside studies to\nAtkinson, he did not even venture to suggest a level of\nincreased risk for heart disease or stroke. And his\nprediction for lung cancer risk is even more ambiguous.\nThat risk, he says cryptically, \"develops more slowly.\"\n\nMoreover, Helling requires \"more than a scientific and\nstatistical inquiry into the seriousness of the potential harm\nand the likelihood that such injury to health will actually\nbe caused by exposure to ETS.\" 509 U.S. at 36 (emphasis\nadded). The risk must \"be so grave that it violates\ncontemporary standards of decency to expose anyone\nunwillingly to such a risk.\" Id. Here, we do not know the\nrisk, but even the studies Dr. Wells cites make it obvious\nthat Atkinson is by no means likely to develop heart disease\nor lung cancer because he lived with a smoking cellmate (or\ncellmates) for several months. It thus appears a leap of\nlogic to conclude that society finds this risk to exceed\n\"contemporary standards of decency.\" After all, millions of\npeople not in prison voluntarily tolerate similar levels of\nrisk every day from second-hand smoke and numerous\nother sources. (Indeed, millions more smoke themselves.) In\nthis context, Atkinson cannot state an Eighth Amendment\nclaim based on his risk of future injury caused by ETS.6\n\nAs with the present injury claim, the majority’s analysis\non this issue is unconvincing. The majority says nary a\n\fword about Atkinson’s failure to provide scientific or\nstatistical evidence in support of his claim, as Helling\nexpressly requires. And it offers no reason to believe that\nthe risks to which Atkinson alleges he was exposed are so\ngrave that it violates contemporary standards of decency to\nexpose anyone to them unwillingly.\n\nII. Step Two: Is the Right Clearly Established?\n\nBecause Atkinson does not state an Eighth Amendment\nviolation on either his present injury or future injury\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Because Atkinson cannot satisfy the objective requirements of showing\na serious medical need or an unreasonably grave risk of injury on either\nhis present injury or future injury claims, we do not need to consider\nwhether prison officials demonstrated deliberate indifference.\n\n                                33\n\n\nclaims, we do not have to consider whether his rights under\nthe Eighth Amendment were clearly established. See\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 201 (\"If no constitutional right would\nhave been violated were the allegations established, there is\nno necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified\nimmunity.\"). Nonetheless, the majority’s analysis on this\npoint merits a response.\n\nA right is clearly established if \"it would be clear to a\nreasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the\nsituation he confronted.\" Id. at 202. Qualified immunity\n\"operates ‘to ensure that before they are subjected to suit,\nofficers are on notice their conduct is unlawful.’ \" Hope v.\nPelzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2508</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2515 (2002) (citation omitted).\nAccordingly, if our Court has not decided a particular\nquestion (which is the case here) and several other courts\nhave reached inconsistent outcomes on relatively similar\nfacts (which is also the case here7), the right at issue\ncannot be clearly established. See Donovan v. City of\nMilwaukee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664096\"><a href=\"/opinion/664096/terry-donovan-special-administrator-in-the-matter-of-the-estate-of-dana-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 953 (7th Cir. 1994) (\"Because only\ntwo circuits had considered cases on point, reaching\nopposite results, we conclude that ‘the relevant case law\nwas still developing [and] the key issue in this case had not\nbeen clearly settled.’ \") (citation omitted); see also Wilson v.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. The majority cites a number of opinions in support of its assertion\nthat prisoners have a clearly established right to be free from\nunreasonable levels of ETS. In most of these decisions the court made\nlittle effort to determine whether the circumstances represented an\nunacceptable risk to prisoners’ health, presumably because most of the\ncases involved appeals from rulings on motions to dismiss, a much\neasier stage to survive than summary judgment because, unlike\nsummary judgment, motions to dismiss require no evidentiary support\nfor the plaintiffs’ claims. Ultimately, ETS claims for either present or\nfuture injuries rarely succeed unless the exposure is obviously\nintolerable. See, e.g., Richardson v. Spurlock , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"25024\"><a href=\"/opinion/25024/richardson-v-spurlock/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir.\n2001); Henderson v.

The majority simply passes on\nthe mandatory examination into whether this plaintiff\nunder the circumstances of this case had a clearly\nestablished Eighth Amendment right to not be exposed to\nthis level of ETS. See Mills, 229 F.3d at 1143, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1250781</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (\"Helling does not guarantee plaintiff a\nsmoke free environment.\").\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. For example, the majority relies primarily on Warren v. Keane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766728\"><a href=\"/opinion/766728/vince-warren-tyrone-benton-john-murray-v-john-p-keane-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1999), in which the Second Circuit found that inmates\ncould survive summary judgment on their future injury ETS claim by\nalleging that their confinement \"creates serious long-term health risks.\"\nId. at 332. The cursory, four-page Warren opinion did not consider\nwhether the facts plaintiffs alleged stated an Eighth Amendment\nviolation, did not mention the level of smoke exposure or why that level\nmight be unreasonably high under Helling, and referenced neither the\nrequired \"scientific and statistical inquiry\" nor any support for the\nproposition that society would find the ETS levels in that case --\nwhatever they might have been -- intolerable for its prisoners.\n\nContrary to the majority’s assertion, I do not fail to recognize that\nWarren is factually and procedurally analogous. Warren lacks persuasive\nvalue not because it is distinguishable, but rather because it fails to\nperform the analysis mandated by a prisoner ETS claim.\n\n                                35\n\n\n* * * * *\n\fOn the present injury claim, considering the lack of\nmedical evidence in Atkinson’s favor, no reasonable prison\nofficial could have predicted that Atkinson’s relatively minor\nsymptoms (which appear to have been caused by seasonal\nallergies) would support an Eighth Amendment suit. The\nmajority cites no case to the contrary, and certainly not the\n\"consensus of cases,\" Rogers, 249 F.3d at 287-88, needed\nto overcome qualified immunity.\n\nOn the future injury claim, neither the Supreme Court\nnor any other court has stated that a particular level of ETS\nviolates the Eighth Amendment. Helling did not conclude\nthat the level of ETS exposure in that case -- five packs a\nday in a two-person cell -- was cruel and unusual; the\nSupreme Court remanded for the trial court to make this\ndetermination following a fact-intensive inquiry. Our\njurisdiction is limited to reviewing whether the set of facts\nidentified by the District Court is sufficient to establish a\nviolation of a clearly established constitutional violation.\nThe facts identified by the District Court’s analysis in this\ncase do not.\n\nFor these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                36\n\f</pre>",
