Following an interlocutory appeal\n\non questions of standing and abstention that was dismissed as\n\nimprovidently       granted,       the    district        court    signed     a    judgment\n\nstipulated to by the parties making permanent, and therefore\n\nappealable,       the    court=s     earlier           preliminary       injunction        and\n\ndeclaratory relief which found that the State=s statutes violated\n\nthe Establishment        Clause      of    the        First   Amendment.          The    State\n\nappeals, contesting the rulings of the district court on issues\n\nimplicating       the   Tax   Injunction         Act,     the   ACLU=s    standing,        and\n\nabstention as well as comity.                    Because we find as a threshold\n\nmatter, that jurisdiction was inappropriate, we make no judgment\n\nconcerning the issues of standing, abstention, comity, or the\n\nsubstantive merits of the constitutional challenge.\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n       In 1998, the Louisiana legislature amended and reenacted LA.\n\nREV. STAT. ' 47:301(6) and ' 33:4574.1(A)(1)(b) and enacted LA.\n\nREV. STAT. ' 47:301(8)(d) and (e), and (14)(b)(iv), to exclude\n\nspecified    property     owned      by    nonprofit          religious     organizations\n\nfrom   the   definition       of    Ahotel@      and     Aplaces   of     amusement,@       to\n\nexcept churches and synagogues from paying sales and use taxes\n\n\n                                             2\n\fwhen    purchasing    bibles,   or     literature     used     for   religious\n\ninstruction classes, and to define Aperson@ to exclude the Little\n\nSisters of the Poor relative to particular purchases.                The intent\n\nof the Legislature was to exempt those establishments from paying\n\nstate   and   local   sales   and    use   taxes,   provided    that   revenue\n\ngenerated from the exempted property, or publications acquired,\n\nbe used for religious purposes.\n\n       The statutes thus enacted and amended, or enacted anew,\n\ncurrently read, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\nLA. REV. STAT. ' 47:301(6)(b)\n\n       For purposes of the sales and use taxes of all tax\n       authorities in this state, the term Ahotel@ as defined\n       herein shall not include camp and retreat facilities\n       owned and operated for religious purposes by nonprofit\n       religious organizations, which includes recognized\n       domestic nonprofit corporations organized for religious\n       purposes, provided that the net revenue derived from\n       the organization=s property is devoted wholly to\n       religious purposes.   For purposes of this Paragraph,\n       the term Ahotel@ shall include camp and retreat\n       facilities, which sell rooms or other accommodations to\n       transient guests.     However, Atransient guest@ for\n       purposes of this Paragraph shall not include guests who\n       participate in organized religious activities, which\n       take place at such camp or retreat facilities. It is\n       the intention of the legislature to tax the furnishing\n       of rooms to those who merely purchase lodging at such\n       facilities.\n\nLA. REV. STAT. ' 47:301(8)(d)\n\n       (i) For purposes of the payment of the state sales and\n       use tax and the sales and use tax levied by any\n       political subdivision, the term Aperson@ shall not\n       include a church or synagogue that is recognized by the\n       United States Internal Revenue Service as entitled to\n                                       3\n\f     exemption under Section 501(c)(3) of the United States\n     Internal Revenue Service Code.\n\n     (ii) The secretary of the Department of Revenue shall\n     promulgate rules and regulations defining the terms\n     Achurch@ and Asynagogue@ for purposes of this exclusion.\n     The definitions shall be consistent with the criteria\n     established by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in\n     identifying organizations that qualify for church\n     status for federal income tax purposes.\n\n     (iii) No church or synagogue shall claim exemption or\n     exclusion from the state sales and use tax or the sales\n     and use tax levied by any political subdivision before\n     having obtained a certificate of authorization from the\n     secretary of the Department of Revenue. The secretary\n     shall develop applications for such certificates. The\n     certificates shall be issued without charge to the\n     institutions that qualify.\n\n     (iv)    The exclusion from the sales and use tax\n     authorized by this Subparagraph shall apply only to\n     purchases of bibles, song books, or literature used for\n     religious instruction classes.\n\nLA. REV. STAT. ' 47:301(8)(e)\n\n     (i) For purposes of the payment of the state sales and\n     use tax and the sales and use tax levied by any\n     political subdivision, the term Aperson@ shall not\n     include the Society of the Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\n     (ii) The secretary of the Department of Revenue shall\n     promulgate rules and regulations for purposes of this\n     exclusion.   The definitions shall be consistent with\n     the criteria established by the U.S. Internal Revenue\n     Service in identifying tax-exempt status for federal\n     income tax purposes.\n\n     (iii) No member of the Society of the Little Sisters\n     of the Poor shall claim exemption or exclusion from the\n     state sales and use tax or the sales and use tax levied\n     by any political subdivision before having obtained a\n     certificate of authorization from the secretary of the\n     Department of Revenue.    The secretary shall develop\n     applications for such certificates. The certificates\n                                4\n\f     shall be issued without charge to the entities which\n     qualify.\n\nLA. REV. STAT. ' 47:301(14)(b)(iv)\n\n     For purposes of the sales and use taxes of all tax\n     authorities in the state, the term Aplaces of\n     amusement@ as used herein shall not include camp and\n     retreat facilities owned and operated for religious\n     purposes by nonprofit religious organizations, which\n     includes recognized domestic nonprofit corporations\n     organized for religious purposes, provided that the net\n     revenue derived from the organization=s property is\n     devoted wholly to religious purposes.\n\nLA. REV. STAT. ' 33:4574.1(A)(1)(b)\n\n     The word Ahotel@ as used herein shall not include camp\n\n     and retreat facilities owned and operated for religious\n\n     purposes by nonprofit religious organizations, which\n\n     includes    recognized        domestic       nonprofit      corporations\n\n     organized for religious purposes, provided that the net\n\n     revenue    derived     from    the       organization=s     property    is\n\n     devoted wholly to religious purposes.\n\n     In 2000, the ACLU filed this suit seeking to have these\n\nstatutes    declared   unconstitutional           and    to   enjoin   the   State=s\n\nenforcement     of     these      statutes        through      preliminary        and,\n\neventually,     permanent      injunctions.             The   Secretary      of   the\n\nLouisiana     Department     of    Revenue        was    named    defendant,      and\n\nthereafter his successor was substituted.\n\n     The State filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure arguing that the Tax Injunction\n                                          5\n\fAct prevented the court from hearing the case and the ACLU filed\n\nan opposition.       Following argument, the district court denied the\n\nState=s    motion    and     ordered     the     State    to     file    a    memorandum\n\naddressing     abstention         and    the     sufficiency       of     state     court\n\nremedies; after which the ACLU filed a response.                              Later, the\n\ndistrict court ordered the parties to submit memoranda on the\n\nissue of standing.\n\n     The     district       court    eventually      denied       both       the   State=s\n\nchallenge to the ACLU=s standing and the State=s request that the\n\ndistrict court abstain from hearing this case.                            The district\n\ncourt nevertheless certified both the abstention and standing\n\nissues for interlocutory appeal under ' 1292(b).\n\n     A    panel     of   this    Court   granted      the      State=s    petition    for\n\npermission to appeal those interlocutory orders.                             Thereafter,\n\nhowever,     the    panel       dismissed       without   prejudice          the   State=s\n\ninterlocutory appeal as improvidently granted.\n\n     Then    the     district       court   granted       the    ACLU=s      motion   for\n\npreliminary injunction and declaratory relief.                      The court found\n\nthat the statutes violated the Establishment Clause of the First\n\nAmendment.     The parties then entered into a stipulated judgment,\n\nwhich was signed by the district court, granting a permanent\n\ninjunction against the State, with reservation of the right to\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fappeal by both parties on any and all issues stemming from the\n\ncourt=s ruling on the preliminary injunction.\n\n     The    State   now    appeals,       contesting        the   rulings   of     the\n\ndistrict    court   on    whether       the   court   was    barred    by   the    Tax\n\nInjunction Act from exercising jurisdiction, whether the ACLU has\n\nstanding, and whether the district court should have abstained or\n\nwhether    principles     of    comity    prevent     the    federal   court      from\n\ndeciding the case.        Because, we find that the Tax Injunction Act\n\nof 1937, 28 U.S.C. ' 1341, prevents the federal district court\n\nfrom hearing this challenge to the State=s tax scheme, we reverse\n\nthe district court=s denial of the State=s Rule 12(b) motion to\n\ndismiss and remand the case with instructions for the court to\n\ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction.                Because the district court\n\nlacked jurisdiction, we do not address on appeal any of the other\n\nissues.\n\n                                    DISCUSSION\n\n     Whether the district court was prevented from exercising\n\njurisdiction over the case because of the Tax Injunction Act is a\n\nquestion    of   subject       matter    jurisdiction       subject    to   de    novo\n\nreview.    Home Builders Ass'n of Miss., Inc. v. City of Madison,\n\nMiss., 143 F.3d 1006, 1010 (5th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).\n\nThe Tax Injunction Act states: \"The district courts shall not\n\nenjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of\n\n\n                                          7\n\fany tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient\n\nremedy may be had in the courts of such State.\"                                      28 U.S.C. '\n\n1341.       According to the Supreme Court, this statutory text should\n\nbe interpreted to advance its purpose of \"confin[ing] federal\n\ncourt intervention in state government . . . .\"                                   Ark. v. Farm\n\nCredit      Servs.        of    Cent.       Ark.,       520    U.S.   821,     826-827       (1997)\n\n(citations omitted).               We have stated that the statute Ais meant\n\nto     be    a    broad        jurisdictional           impediment       to     federal      court\n\ninterference         with        the   administration            of   state      tax    systems.@\n\nUnited Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Whitman, 595 F.2d 323, 326 (5th Cir.\n\n1979) (emphasis added).\n\n       ABy its terms, the Act bars anticipatory relief, suits to\n\nstop (>enjoin, suspend or restrain=) the collection of taxes@ and\n\nalso        suits        seeking       to      have       state       tax      laws     declared\n\nunconstitutional.               Jefferson County, Ala. v. Acker, 527 U.S. 423,\n\n433 (1999); Cal. v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U.S. 393, 408\n\n(1982).          ABut a suit to collect a tax is surely not brought to\n\nrestrain         state    action,       and    therefore         does    not    fit    the    Act=s\n\ndescription          of        suits    barred          from    federal        district      court\n\nadjudication.@             Jefferson          County,         Ala.,   527     U.S.     at    433-34\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n       There has never been any dispute among the present parties\n\nconcerning          whether       Louisiana         provides      a     Aplain,      speedy     and\n\n\n                                                    8\n\fefficient remedy,@ but rather the entire dispute has focused on\n\nwhether the Tax Injunction Act prevents the federal district\n\ncourt from deciding a case in which the plaintiff seeks to have\n\ntax Aexemptions,@ which are not specifically enumerated as an\n\narea outside of federal jurisdiction in the language of the Act,\n\ndeclared unconstitutional.        According to the district court, this\n\nsuit involves the collection of a state tax and therefore the\n\ndistrict court found that the Tax Injunction Act did not require\n\ndismissal of the action.           The ACLU argues that this dispute\n\nconcerns    tax   exemptions     and   not       the    Aassessment,      levy,   or\n\ncollection@ of a tax and therefore the Tax Injunction Act does\n\nnot apply.      The State argued in its Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss\n\nand again on appeal that the Tax Injunction Act prevents the\n\nfederal district court from exercising jurisdiction over this\n\ncase   because    this   case   does   not      involve    the   State    suing   to\n\ncollect taxes but rather a challenge to the assessment of state\n\ntaxes through the State=s exemption process and any challenge can\n\nbe brought in state court.\n\n       We conclude that this case involves a putative taxpayer\n\nseeking to prevent the State from carrying out the current tax\n\nsystem     by   having   a   portion       of    that     tax    system   declared\n\nunconstitutional; a case that because of the Tax Injunction Act,\n\ncannot be heard in federal district court.                 Our holding is based\n\n\n                                       9\n\fon three determinations.        First, this is not a suit by the State\n\nto   collect    a    tax.      Second,      assessment   of   exemptions   is\n\nencompassed by the Act.         Third, this Circuit=s precedent and the\n\npurpose of     the   Act    indicate   that   the   federal   district   court\n\nshould not have exercised jurisdiction over this case.\n\n     First, the district court erred in holding that this case\n\ninvolved the collection of a tax and therefore the Tax Injunction\n\nAct did not bar jurisdiction.            Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit\n\ncases where the Tax Injunction Act has been held inapplicable\n\ninvolved a state, a state subdivision or an agent of a state\n\nseeking to collect a tax from an individual taxpayer or a group\n\nof individual taxpayers, not a plaintiff seeking to have a state\n\ntax law declared unconstitutional.            Jefferson County, Ala., 527\n\nU.S. at 427-28 (involving a county=s attempt to collect taxes\n\nfrom a group of taxpayers); Appling County v. Mun. Elec. Auth. of\n\nGa., 621 F.2d 1301, 1303 (5th Cir. 1980) (involving a county\n\nsuing a group of taxpayers to collect taxes); Louisiana Land and\n\nExploration Co. v. Pilot Petroleum Corp., 900 F.2d 816, 818 (5th\n\nCir. 1990) (involving someone Aacting merely as an agent of the\n\nstate for the collection and payment of the tax to the state@\n\nsuing to collect a tax).          Further, it is not necessarily true\n\nthat declaring the exemptions to be unconstitutional will result\n\nin the State collecting more taxes and therefore this suit is not\n\n\n                                       10\n\fa de facto suit to collect taxes.                    In fact even as the ACLU\n\nargues, just the opposite could occur, the State may resolve any\n\nputative     constitutional         problems       created    by   the    challenged\n\nstatutes by exempting more entities and therefore collecting less\n\ntaxes.\n\n           Second,       although    the    ACLU    claims    that     this    dispute\n\ninvolves     tax    exemptions       and    not     the    Aassessment,       levy   or\n\ncollection of any tax,@ a dictionary definition of Aassessment@\n\nindicates exemptions are also within the Act=s jurisdictional\n\nbar.     As ordinarily defined, assessment means Athe entire plan or\n\nscheme fixed upon for charging or taxing.@                    Webster=s Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary 131 (1981).                 The challenged exemptions\n\nin this case are part of Athe entire plan or scheme fixed upon\n\nfor charging or taxing@ in the State of Louisiana.                       Even a more\n\nprecise definition of assessment, such as Adetermining the share\n\nof a tax to be paid by each of many persons@ or Athe process of\n\nascertaining       and    adjusting        the    shares     respectively      to    be\n\ncontributed        by    several     persons@      would     include     within      it\n\nexemptions that are granted, like the challenged exemptions, to\n\norganizations so that these organizations do not have to pay the\n\ntaxes they would have had to pay but for the exemptions.                       Black=s\n\nLaw Dictionary 116-17 (6th Ed. 1990).                      In fact, as the State\n\npoints out in its brief, part of the Aassessment@ process is\n\n\n                                           11\n\fdetermining whether an individual or organization qualifies for\n\nan    exemption.       Based    on    our    review    of    the    definition       of\n\nassessment, we conclude that this present challenge to exemptions\n\nis within the Act=s jurisdictional bar.\n\n       We realize that our conclusion concerning exemptions as an\n\narea encompassed in the assessment process and therefore within\n\nthe Tax Injunction Act=s jurisdictional bar is both consistent\n\nand    inconsistent     with    what    other      circuit     courts     have   held\n\nconcerning      challenges     to   state    tax    schemes.       Our    holding    is\n\nconsistent with In re Gillis, a decision of the Sixth Circuit\n\nholding that the principles underlining the Tax Injunction Act\n\nprevented the federal district court from addressing an action\n\nbrought    by    taxpayers      claiming     that     Kentucky      was    assessing\n\nproperty taxes at a rate lower than the state should have, even\n\nthough the result sought by the plaintiffs would have forced\n\nKentucky to collect more in taxes.                 836 F.2d 1001, 1005-06 (6th\n\nCir. 1988).      Our holding is inconsistent with Winn v. Killian, a\n\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit holding that the Tax Injunction Act\n\ndid not prevent the federal district court from hearing a case\n\nchallenging      the   constitutionality        of    tax    credits      granted   to\n\nprivate schools in Arizona.          307 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n       In Winn, the Ninth Circuit cited several cases as supporting\n\nits holding that can be distinguished from the present case.                        Two\n\n\n                                        12\n\fcircuit court cases were cited by the Ninth Circuit.            The often\n\ncited Fifth Circuit case of Hargrave v. McKinney, which delved\n\ninto the legislative history of the Tax Injunction Act, was cited\n\nto in Winn.     413 F.2d 320, 325-26 (5th Cir. 1969).           Hargrave,\n\nhowever,   is   inapposite   to   the   present   case   because,   as   the\n\nHargrave Court noted in its Aexceedingly narrow@ holding, it was\n\nonly reversing a district court decision refusing to request that\n\na three-judge court be convened to address a suit seeking to\n\ncompel the full collection and disbursement of county taxes.             Id.\n\nat 326.    The statutory law applicable in Hargrave is not present\n\nin this case.      Likewise, the Seventh Circuit case of Dunn v.\n\nCarey was cited in Winn but is inapplicable to the present case\n\nbecause Dunn only supports the proposition that taxpayers can use\n\nthe federal courts to assert a claim for the collection of taxes\n\nimposed by a federal consent decree and the Tax Injunction Act\n\ndoes not prevent jurisdiction over such a suit.             808 F.2d 555,\n\n558-59 (7th Cir. 1986).      There is not a federal consent decree at\n\nissue in the present case.2\n     2\n       Two district court cases were also cited by the Winn court\nas supportive of their decision but are equally unpersuasive to\nus. Winn cited Moton v. Lambert, in which a district court found\nthat the Tax Injunction Act did not bar the court from hearing a\ncivil rights action brought by parents of black children\nchallenging the constitutionality of certain tax exemptions that\napplied to only racially segregated schools. 508 F. Supp. 367,\n368 (N.D. Miss. 1981). In the Moton decision, however, there is\nvery little discussion of the Tax Injunction Act and the case was\nnot appealed. Id. Winn also cited Rojas v. Fitch, a case in\nwhich a district court allowed jurisdiction in a suit challenging\n                                13\n\f       Third, this Circuit has always interpreted the Act broadly.\n\nWe have stated:        AThe concept that section 1341 is not a narrow\n\nstatute    aimed       only    at      injunctive          interference       with   tax\n\ncollection,      but    is    rather     a        broad    restriction    on    federal\n\njurisdiction in suits that impede state tax administration, has\n\ncontinued to gain credence in the federal courts.@                        United Gas\n\nPipe Line Co., 595 F.2d at 326.                   Moreover, this Circuit has held\n\nthat   federal     district     courts        were        prohibited   from    deciding\n\ndisputes involving tax related concepts or functions similar to\n\nexemptions due to the jurisdictional limitations imposed by the\n\nTax Injunction Act.           Dawson v. Childs, 665 F.2d 705, 710 (5th\n\nCir. 1982) (involving the dissolution of tax liens); United Gas\n\nPipe Line Co., 595 F.2d at 323 (involving the application of tax\n\nrefunds); Daytona Beach Racing and Recreational Facilities Dist.\n\nv. Volusia County, 579 F.2d 367, 368 (5th Cir. 1978),(involving\n\nthe repealing of tax exemptions).\n\n       In Dawson, this Court held that A[i]n dissolving a lien on\n\nproperty, a federal court interferes with the state's fiscal\n\n\n\nthe constitutionality of exempting religious organizations from\nunemployment tax. 928 F. Supp. 155, 159-60 (D. R.I. 1996),\naffirmed on other grounds, 127 F.3d 184 (1st Cir. 1997). The\nRojas court ultimately upheld the exemption as constitutional.\nId. at 167. However, the First Circuit has since indicated, in\nHardemon v. City of Boston, that the merits should not have been\nreached without further inquiry into the jurisdictional question.\n144 F.3d 24, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                             14\n\fprogram just as surely as if it enjoined collection or assessment\n\nof the tax itself@ and therefore jurisdiction was inappropriate.\n\n665 F.2d at 710.               In United Gas, this Circuit held that a suit\n\nconcerning a tax refund was within the scope of the Act and\n\ntherefore could not be heard in federal district court.                           595 F.2d\n\nat    326.         In   Daytona    Beach,    this    Circuit      held     that    the   Tax\n\nInjunction         Act    prevented    the       federal     court      from   exercising\n\njurisdiction over a case where a taxpayer was challenging the\n\nactions of a state legislature in repealing a previously granted\n\ntax exemption.            579 F.2d at 369.          Although our analysis focused\n\non whether a state remedy was available, we assumed the Tax\n\nInjunction Act was a jurisdictional bar to hearing a challenge to\n\nthe repealing of state tax exemptions.                           Id.      Therefore, the\n\nprecedent      of       this   Circuit,     which    is    in    accordance       with   the\n\npurpose       of    the    Act,    dictates       that     the    Tax     Injunction     Act\n\nprohibits the district court from hearing this case.\n\n       However, this does not mean the ACLU is left with no other\n\nrecourse.          For example, after a review of the history of the Act\n\nwe noted in Bland v. McHann that, AWe are convinced that both\n\nlong standing policy and congressional restriction of federal\n\njurisdiction in cases involving state tax administration make it\n\nthe    duty    of       federal   courts    to    withhold       relief    when    a   state\n\nlegislature has provided an adequate scheme whereby a taxpayer\n\n\n                                             15\n\fmay maintain a suit to challenge a state tax.    The taxpayer may\n\nassert his federal rights in the state courts and secure a review\n\nby the Supreme Court.@   463 F.2d 21, 24 (5th Cir. 1972).   That is\n\nprecisely what the Tax Injunction Act requires the ACLU to do,\n\ni.e., first challenge the Louisiana statutes in Louisiana and if\n\nneed be secure review by the Supreme Court.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the record of this case, the parties=\n\nrespective briefing and arguments, and for the reasons set forth\n\nabove, we reverse the decision of the district court and remand\n\nthe case with instructions for the district court to dismiss for\n\nlack of jurisdiction under the Tax Injunction Act.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                                16\n\f",

Following an interlocutory appeal\n\non questions of standing and abstention that was dismissed as\n\nimprovidently       granted,       the    district        court    signed     a    judgment\n\nstipulated to by the parties making permanent, and therefore\n\nappealable,       the    court=s     earlier           preliminary       injunction        and\n\ndeclaratory relief which found that the State=s statutes violated\n\nthe Establishment        Clause      of    the        First   Amendment.          The    State\n\nappeals, contesting the rulings of the district court on issues\n\nimplicating       the   Tax   Injunction         Act,     the   ACLU=s    standing,        and\n\nabstention as well as comity.

STAT. ' 47:301(6) and ' 33:4574.1(A)(1)(b) and enacted LA.\n\nREV. STAT. ' 47:301(8)(d) and (e), and (14)(b)(iv), to exclude\n\nspecified    property     owned      by    nonprofit          religious     organizations\n\nfrom   the   definition       of    Ahotel@      and     Aplaces   of     amusement,@       to\n\nexcept churches and synagogues from paying sales and use taxes\n\n\n                                             2\n\fwhen    purchasing    bibles,   or     literature     used     for   religious\n\ninstruction classes, and to define Aperson@ to exclude the Little\n\nSisters of the Poor relative to particular purchases.                The intent\n\nof the Legislature was to exempt those establishments from paying\n\nstate   and   local   sales   and    use   taxes,   provided    that   revenue\n\ngenerated from the exempted property, or publications acquired,\n\nbe used for religious purposes.\n\n       The statutes thus enacted and amended, or enacted anew,\n\ncurrently read, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\nLA. REV. STAT. ' 47:301(6)(b)\n\n       For purposes of the sales and use taxes of all tax\n       authorities in this state, the term Ahotel@ as defined\n       herein shall not include camp and retreat facilities\n       owned and operated for religious purposes by nonprofit\n       religious organizations, which includes recognized\n       domestic nonprofit corporations organized for religious\n       purposes, provided that the net revenue derived from\n       the organization=s property is devoted wholly to\n       religious purposes.   For purposes of this Paragraph,\n       the term Ahotel@ shall include camp and retreat\n       facilities, which sell rooms or other accommodations to\n       transient guests.     However, Atransient guest@ for\n       purposes of this Paragraph shall not include guests who\n       participate in organized religious activities, which\n       take place at such camp or retreat facilities. It is\n       the intention of the legislature to tax the furnishing\n       of rooms to those who merely purchase lodging at such\n       facilities.\n\nLA. REV. STAT. ' 47:301(8)(d)\n\n       (i) For purposes of the payment of the state sales and\n       use tax and the sales and use tax levied by any\n       political subdivision, the term Aperson@ shall not\n       include a church or synagogue that is recognized by the\n       United States Internal Revenue Service as entitled to\n                                       3\n\f     exemption under Section 501(c)(3) of the United States\n     Internal Revenue Service Code.\n\n     (ii) The secretary of the Department of Revenue shall\n     promulgate rules and regulations defining the terms\n     Achurch@ and Asynagogue@ for purposes of this exclusion.\n     The definitions shall be consistent with the criteria\n     established by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in\n     identifying organizations that qualify for church\n     status for federal income tax purposes.\n\n     (iii) No church or synagogue shall claim exemption or\n     exclusion from the state sales and use tax or the sales\n     and use tax levied by any political subdivision before\n     having obtained a certificate of authorization from the\n     secretary of the Department of Revenue. The secretary\n     shall develop applications for such certificates. The\n     certificates shall be issued without charge to the\n     institutions that qualify.\n\n     (iv)    The exclusion from the sales and use tax\n     authorized by this Subparagraph shall apply only to\n     purchases of bibles, song books, or literature used for\n     religious instruction classes.\n\nLA. REV. STAT. ' 47:301(8)(e)\n\n     (i) For purposes of the payment of the state sales and\n     use tax and the sales and use tax levied by any\n     political subdivision, the term Aperson@ shall not\n     include the Society of the Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\n     (ii) The secretary of the Department of Revenue shall\n     promulgate rules and regulations for purposes of this\n     exclusion.   The definitions shall be consistent with\n     the criteria established by the U.S. Internal Revenue\n     Service in identifying tax-exempt status for federal\n     income tax purposes.\n\n     (iii) No member of the Society of the Little Sisters\n     of the Poor shall claim exemption or exclusion from the\n     state sales and use tax or the sales and use tax levied\n     by any political subdivision before having obtained a\n     certificate of authorization from the secretary of the\n     Department of Revenue.    The secretary shall develop\n     applications for such certificates. The certificates\n                                4\n\f     shall be issued without charge to the entities which\n     qualify.\n\nLA. REV. STAT. ' 47:301(14)(b)(iv)\n\n     For purposes of the sales and use taxes of all tax\n     authorities in the state, the term Aplaces of\n     amusement@ as used herein shall not include camp and\n     retreat facilities owned and operated for religious\n     purposes by nonprofit religious organizations, which\n     includes recognized domestic nonprofit corporations\n     organized for religious purposes, provided that the net\n     revenue derived from the organization=s property is\n     devoted wholly to religious purposes.\n\nLA. REV. STAT. ' 33:4574.1(A)(1)(b)\n\n     The word Ahotel@ as used herein shall not include camp\n\n     and retreat facilities owned and operated for religious\n\n     purposes by nonprofit religious organizations, which\n\n     includes    recognized        domestic       nonprofit      corporations\n\n     organized for religious purposes, provided that the net\n\n     revenue    derived     from    the       organization=s     property    is\n\n     devoted wholly to religious purposes.\n\n     In 2000, the ACLU filed this suit seeking to have these\n\nstatutes    declared   unconstitutional           and    to   enjoin   the   State=s\n\nenforcement     of     these      statutes        through      preliminary        and,\n\neventually,     permanent      injunctions.             The   Secretary      of   the\n\nLouisiana     Department     of    Revenue        was    named    defendant,      and\n\nthereafter his successor was substituted.\n\n     The State filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure arguing that the Tax Injunction\n                                          5\n\fAct prevented the court from hearing the case and the ACLU filed\n\nan opposition.       Following argument, the district court denied the\n\nState=s    motion    and     ordered     the     State    to     file    a    memorandum\n\naddressing     abstention         and    the     sufficiency       of     state     court\n\nremedies; after which the ACLU filed a response.                              Later, the\n\ndistrict court ordered the parties to submit memoranda on the\n\nissue of standing.\n\n     The     district       court    eventually      denied       both       the   State=s\n\nchallenge to the ACLU=s standing and the State=s request that the\n\ndistrict court abstain from hearing this case.                            The district\n\ncourt nevertheless certified both the abstention and standing\n\nissues for interlocutory appeal under ' 1292(b).\n\n     A    panel     of   this    Court   granted      the      State=s    petition    for\n\npermission to appeal those interlocutory orders.                             Thereafter,\n\nhowever,     the    panel       dismissed       without   prejudice          the   State=s\n\ninterlocutory appeal as improvidently granted.\n\n     Then    the     district       court   granted       the    ACLU=s      motion   for\n\npreliminary injunction and declaratory relief.                      The court found\n\nthat the statutes violated the Establishment Clause of the First\n\nAmendment.     The parties then entered into a stipulated judgment,\n\nwhich was signed by the district court, granting a permanent\n\ninjunction against the State, with reservation of the right to\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fappeal by both parties on any and all issues stemming from the\n\ncourt=s ruling on the preliminary injunction.\n\n     The    State   now    appeals,       contesting        the   rulings   of     the\n\ndistrict    court   on    whether       the   court   was    barred    by   the    Tax\n\nInjunction Act from exercising jurisdiction, whether the ACLU has\n\nstanding, and whether the district court should have abstained or\n\nwhether    principles     of    comity    prevent     the    federal   court      from\n\ndeciding the case.        Because, we find that the Tax Injunction Act\n\nof 1937, 28 U.S.C. ' 1341, prevents the federal district court\n\nfrom hearing this challenge to the State=s tax scheme, we reverse\n\nthe district court=s denial of the State=s Rule 12(b) motion to\n\ndismiss and remand the case with instructions for the court to\n\ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction.                Because the district court\n\nlacked jurisdiction, we do not address on appeal any of the other\n\nissues.\n\n                                    DISCUSSION\n\n     Whether the district court was prevented from exercising\n\njurisdiction over the case because of the Tax Injunction Act is a\n\nquestion    of   subject       matter    jurisdiction       subject    to   de    novo\n\nreview.

ABut a suit to collect a tax is surely not brought to\n\nrestrain         state    action,       and    therefore         does    not    fit    the    Act=s\n\ndescription          of        suits    barred          from    federal        district      court\n\nadjudication.@             Jefferson          County,         Ala.,   527     U.S.     at    433-34\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n       There has never been any dispute among the present parties\n\nconcerning          whether       Louisiana         provides      a     Aplain,      speedy     and\n\n\n                                                    8\n\fefficient remedy,@ but rather the entire dispute has focused on\n\nwhether the Tax Injunction Act prevents the federal district\n\ncourt from deciding a case in which the plaintiff seeks to have\n\ntax Aexemptions,@ which are not specifically enumerated as an\n\narea outside of federal jurisdiction in the language of the Act,\n\ndeclared unconstitutional.        According to the district court, this\n\nsuit involves the collection of a state tax and therefore the\n\ndistrict court found that the Tax Injunction Act did not require\n\ndismissal of the action.           The ACLU argues that this dispute\n\nconcerns    tax   exemptions     and   not       the    Aassessment,      levy,   or\n\ncollection@ of a tax and therefore the Tax Injunction Act does\n\nnot apply.      The State argued in its Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss\n\nand again on appeal that the Tax Injunction Act prevents the\n\nfederal district court from exercising jurisdiction over this\n\ncase   because    this   case   does   not      involve    the   State    suing   to\n\ncollect taxes but rather a challenge to the assessment of state\n\ntaxes through the State=s exemption process and any challenge can\n\nbe brought in state court.\n\n       We conclude that this case involves a putative taxpayer\n\nseeking to prevent the State from carrying out the current tax\n\nsystem     by   having   a   portion       of    that     tax    system   declared\n\nunconstitutional; a case that because of the Tax Injunction Act,\n\ncannot be heard in federal district court.                 Our holding is based\n\n\n                                       9\n\fon three determinations.        First, this is not a suit by the State\n\nto   collect    a    tax.      Second,      assessment   of   exemptions   is\n\nencompassed by the Act.         Third, this Circuit=s precedent and the\n\npurpose of     the   Act    indicate   that   the   federal   district   court\n\nshould not have exercised jurisdiction over this case.\n\n     First, the district court erred in holding that this case\n\ninvolved the collection of a tax and therefore the Tax Injunction\n\nAct did not bar jurisdiction.            Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit\n\ncases where the Tax Injunction Act has been held inapplicable\n\ninvolved a state, a state subdivision or an agent of a state\n\nseeking to collect a tax from an individual taxpayer or a group\n\nof individual taxpayers, not a plaintiff seeking to have a state\n\ntax law declared unconstitutional.

Further, it is not necessarily true\n\nthat declaring the exemptions to be unconstitutional will result\n\nin the State collecting more taxes and therefore this suit is not\n\n\n                                       10\n\fa de facto suit to collect taxes.                    In fact even as the ACLU\n\nargues, just the opposite could occur, the State may resolve any\n\nputative     constitutional         problems       created    by   the    challenged\n\nstatutes by exempting more entities and therefore collecting less\n\ntaxes.\n\n           Second,       although    the    ACLU    claims    that     this    dispute\n\ninvolves     tax    exemptions       and    not     the    Aassessment,       levy   or\n\ncollection of any tax,@ a dictionary definition of Aassessment@\n\nindicates exemptions are also within the Act=s jurisdictional\n\nbar.     As ordinarily defined, assessment means Athe entire plan or\n\nscheme fixed upon for charging or taxing.@                    Webster=s Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary 131 (1981).                 The challenged exemptions\n\nin this case are part of Athe entire plan or scheme fixed upon\n\nfor charging or taxing@ in the State of Louisiana.                       Even a more\n\nprecise definition of assessment, such as Adetermining the share\n\nof a tax to be paid by each of many persons@ or Athe process of\n\nascertaining       and    adjusting        the    shares     respectively      to    be\n\ncontributed        by    several     persons@      would     include     within      it\n\nexemptions that are granted, like the challenged exemptions, to\n\norganizations so that these organizations do not have to pay the\n\ntaxes they would have had to pay but for the exemptions.                       Black=s\n\nLaw Dictionary 116-17 (6th Ed. 1990).                      In fact, as the State\n\npoints out in its brief, part of the Aassessment@ process is\n\n\n                                           11\n\fdetermining whether an individual or organization qualifies for\n\nan    exemption.       Based    on    our    review    of    the    definition       of\n\nassessment, we conclude that this present challenge to exemptions\n\nis within the Act=s jurisdictional bar.\n\n       We realize that our conclusion concerning exemptions as an\n\narea encompassed in the assessment process and therefore within\n\nthe Tax Injunction Act=s jurisdictional bar is both consistent\n\nand    inconsistent     with    what    other      circuit     courts     have   held\n\nconcerning      challenges     to   state    tax    schemes.       Our    holding    is\n\nconsistent with In re Gillis, a decision of the Sixth Circuit\n\nholding that the principles underlining the Tax Injunction Act\n\nprevented the federal district court from addressing an action\n\nbrought    by    taxpayers      claiming     that     Kentucky      was    assessing\n\nproperty taxes at a rate lower than the state should have, even\n\nthough the result sought by the plaintiffs would have forced\n\nKentucky to collect more in taxes.                 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499772\"><a href=\"/opinion/499772/in-re-gary-gillis-secretary-of-revenue-of-the-state-of-kentucky-clayton/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1005-06 (6th\n\nCir. 1988).

Two\n\n\n                                        12\n\fcircuit court cases were cited by the Ninth Circuit.            The often\n\ncited Fifth Circuit case of Hargrave v.

Hargrave,\n\nhowever,   is   inapposite   to   the   present   case   because,   as   the\n\nHargrave Court noted in its Aexceedingly narrow@ holding, it was\n\nonly reversing a district court decision refusing to request that\n\na three-judge court be convened to address a suit seeking to\n\ncompel the full collection and disbursement of county taxes.

Likewise, the Seventh Circuit case of Dunn v.\n\nCarey was cited in Winn but is inapplicable to the present case\n\nbecause Dunn only supports the proposition that taxpayers can use\n\nthe federal courts to assert a claim for the collection of taxes\n\nimposed by a federal consent decree and the Tax Injunction Act\n\ndoes not prevent jurisdiction over such a suit.             </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481043\"><a href=\"/opinion/481043/michael-a-dunn-v-james-b-carey-delaware-county-sheriff/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n558-59 (7th Cir. 1986).

For example, after a review of the history of the Act\n\nwe noted in Bland v. McHann that, AWe are convinced that both\n\nlong standing policy and congressional restriction of federal\n\njurisdiction in cases involving state tax administration make it\n\nthe    duty    of       federal   courts    to    withhold       relief    when    a   state\n\nlegislature has provided an adequate scheme whereby a taxpayer\n\n\n                                             15\n\fmay maintain a suit to challenge a state tax.    The taxpayer may\n\nassert his federal rights in the state courts and secure a review\n\nby the Supreme Court.@   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"304398\"><a href=\"/opinion/304398/percy-bland-v-robert-mchann/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (5th Cir. 1972).   That is\n\nprecisely what the Tax Injunction Act requires the ACLU to do,\n\ni.e., first challenge the Louisiana statutes in Louisiana and if\n\nneed be secure review by the Supreme Court.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the record of this case, the parties=\n\nrespective briefing and arguments, and for the reasons set forth\n\nabove, we reverse the decision of the district court and remand\n\nthe case with instructions for the district court to dismiss for\n\nlack of jurisdiction under the Tax Injunction Act.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                                16\n\f</pre>",
