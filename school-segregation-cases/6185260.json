Stat. §§ 48-1101 through\n                     48-1126 (Reissue 2010), is patterned after federal title VII of the Civil\n                     Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e (2012), and therefore, it is appro-\n                     priate to look to federal court decisions construing Title VII for guidance\n                     with respect to the Nebraska act.\n                5.\t Fair Employment Practices: Discrimination: Proof.

Stat. § 48-1221(1) (Reissue 2010) is patterned after the federal\n     Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. § 206(d) (2012), it is appropriate to look to\n     federal court decisions construing 29 U.S.C. § 206(d) for guidance with\n     respect to § 48-1221(1).\n 8.\t Claims: Fair Employment Practices: Discrimination: Wages: Proof.\n     When bringing a claim of wage discrimination based on sex under Neb.\n     Rev. Stat. § 48-1221(1) (Reissue 2010), a plaintiff must first establish\n     a prima facie case by showing by a preponderance of the evidence\n     that (1) the plaintiff was paid less than a person of the opposite sex\n     employed in the same establishment; (2) for equal work on jobs requir-\n     ing equal skill, effort, and responsibility; (3) which were performed\n     under similar working conditions. If a plaintiff establishes a prima\n     facie case of wage discrimination based on sex, the burden then shifts\n     to the defendant to prove one of the affirmative defenses set forth in\n     § 48-1221(1).\n 9.\t Fair Employment Practices: Proof. A plaintiff must establish a prima\n     facie case of retaliation under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 48-1114 (Reissue 2010)\n     by showing (1) he or she engaged in protected conduct, (2) he or she\n     was subjected to an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a\n     causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse action.\n10.\t ____: ____. To satisfy the adverse employment action requirement in\n     a retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee\n     would have found the challenged action materially adverse. This, in turn,\n     requires a showing that the employment action might have dissuaded a\n     reasonable worker from reporting the alleged unlawful practice. To meet\n     this burden, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the employment action\n     was material, not trivial, and that it resulted in some concrete injury\n     or harm.\n11.\t Claims: Fair Employment Practices: Public Policy: Damages. Under\n     the public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine, an\n     employee may claim damages for wrongful discharge when the moti-\n     vation for the firing contravenes public policy. The public policy\n     exception is restricted to cases when a clear mandate of public policy\n     has been violated, and it should be limited to manageable and clear\n     standards. In determining whether a clear mandate of public policy is\n     violated, courts should inquire whether the employer’s conduct contra-\n     venes the letter or purpose of a constitutional, statutory, or regulatory\n     provision or scheme.\n\n  Appeal from the District Court for Lancaster County:\nHoracio J.

NATURE OF CASE\n   Patricia A. Knapp filed an action against Kevin Ruser, in his\nofficial capacity, and the Board of Regents of the University\nof Nebraska in which she asserted claims of discriminatory\nwage and employment practices based on her sex as well as\nclaims of employment retaliation. Knapp’s claims arose from\nalleged occurrences while she was a supervising attorney for\nthe civil clinical law program at the University of Nebraska\nCollege of Law. Knapp appeals the orders of the district\ncourt for Lancaster County in which the court sustained the\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment and overruled her\nmotion to alter or amend the judgment. We affirm the district\ncourt’s orders.\n                  II. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   Knapp commenced this action with a complaint filed in\nthe district court on July 11, 2014. In that complaint, Knapp\nset forth eight claims for relief, some based on state law and\nsome based on federal law. In August, the defendants had\nthe action removed to the U.S. District Court for the District\nof Nebraska. In November 2015, the federal court sustained\nthe defendants’ motion for summary judgment in part and\ndismissed certain of Knapp’s claims, which were based on\nfederal law, with prejudice. The federal court remanded the\nremaining claims, which were based on Nebraska state law,\nto the district court for Lancaster County for further proceed-\nings. Knapp v. Ruser, 145 F. Supp. 3d 846 (D. Neb. 2015).\nUpon remand to the state court, Knapp filed an amended\n\f                              - 642 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\ncomplaint which mirrored the operative amended complaint\nshe had filed in the federal court. In the amended complaint,\nshe set forth 10 claims for relief. The federal court had dis-\nmissed the first through third, sixth, eighth, and tenth claims.\nAlso, it remanded the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth claims\nfor further proceedings in the state court. Accordingly, our\nconsideration on appeal is limited to the state district court’s\ndisposition of four claims identified in the operative complaint\nas the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth claims.\n                     1. Background/Facts\n   Knapp, an attorney, began working in the civil clinic as a\ntemporary half-time employee in the summer of 1999. At that\ntime, the director of clinical programs was on a sabbatical,\nand Knapp was hired to cover the portion of his responsibili-\nties that concerned the civil clinic. After the director returned\nfrom sabbatical and informed the college that he would be\nleaving at the end of the fall semester, Knapp was hired as a\ntemporary half-time employee beginning in the spring 2000\nsemester. The understanding was that she would cover the\nformer director’s duties with respect to the civil clinic while\nthe law school considered its long-term strategic plan for the\nclinical programs.\n   Knapp’s half-time employment in the civil clinic ended\nin August 2004 after Ruser was named director of the clini-\ncal programs and the law school hired Richard Moberly to\nperform the duties Knapp had performed in the civil clinic.\nIn 2006, the law school again hired Knapp as a half-time\nemployee in the civil clinic after it determined that Moberly’s\nhalf-time status was not sufficient to meet student needs.\nWhile Knapp and Moberly split duties in the civil clinic,\nMoberly held a full-time position which included additional\nresponsibilities such as teaching doctrinal classes, research,\nand community service.\n   Knapp continued to work half-time in the civil clinic until\nAugust 2011, when Moberly became an associate dean of the\nlaw school and gave up his duties in the civil clinic. Knapp\n\f                              - 643 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nand Ruser agreed that Knapp’s employment as supervising\nattorney in the civil clinic should go to full time. Knapp’s\nposition was classified as that of “Temporary Lecturer” and\nwas designated as a “‘Special Appointment.’” Knapp met\nwith the dean of the law school to discuss her full-time sal-\nary; the dean offered Knapp an annual salary of $80,000.\nAfter Knapp told the dean that the salary was low, the dean\ntold Knapp that she would explore the possibility of increas-\ning the salary by seeking a designation for the position as a\n“‘professor of practice.’” Knapp agreed to accept the salary\nfor the upcoming academic year based on what she believed\nto be the dean’s “good-faith commitment” to find a way to\nincrease her salary. When Knapp told Ruser the salary she\nhad been offered, Ruser told her that the dean had “‘low-\nballed’” her.\n   A year later, in August 2012, Ruser left a letter for Knapp\nsetting forth proposed terms and conditions for her employ-\nment in the upcoming academic year. The letter stated that\nher salary would again be $80,000. Prior to receiving the\nletter, Knapp had had no other communication with the law\nschool’s administration regarding her salary for the upcom-\ning year. The letter prompted Knapp to check the salaries of\nothers working in the clinical programs. She learned from the\nUniversity of Nebraska’s website that a male professor had\nbeen hired in March 2012 to teach a business transactions\nclinic at a salary of $106,000 per year. Knapp thereafter spoke\nwith Ruser regarding her salary, and she told him that after\nseeing others’ salaries, she thought that the salary structure in\nthe clinical programs was “skewed” and that the clinics had a\n“‘gender equity’ problem” that Ruser needed to address. Ruser\nresponded that he was “‘baffled’” by Knapp’s allegations of\ndiscrimination and that the new male professor’s higher sal-\nary was justified by the fact that his position was a tenure\ntrack position.\n   Knapp alleged that the conversation became heated and\nthat afterward, Ruser’s behavior and demeanor toward her\nchanged. Knapp alleged that Ruser acted more hostile and\n\f                              - 644 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nthat he stopped adequately communicating with her. Knapp\nalso observed that Ruser appeared to be neglecting his own\nduties in the clinic, including supervision of students and\ncases. After adopting a child in the spring semester, Ruser\nwent to half time, and Knapp alleged that he “disengaged\neven further” from the clinic, with the result being that the\nclinic “was not fulfilling its ethical obligations to its clients\nor to its students.”\n   In April 2013, Knapp learned that Ruser would be receiving\na lifetime achievement award from the law school. Although\nother members of the clinic’s staff had known of the award\nfor several weeks and had been invited to sit at Ruser’s table\nat the award ceremony, Ruser had not mentioned the award\nto Knapp. This incident prompted Knapp to conclude that her\nrelationship with Ruser “was so badly damaged that it had\nbecome impossible for them to work together as law partners\nin a way that would meet their ethical obligations to their cli-\nents and to their students.”\n   Knapp decided to leave her job at the clinic, but a coworker\nencouraged her to speak with the dean about what was happen-\ning in the clinic. Knapp met with the dean and informed her of\nseveral problems that she perceived in the clinic. Knapp told\nthe dean that problems had existed for women in the clinical\nprogram since the early 1980’s, when Knapp was a student\nat the college. Knapp informed the dean of various concerns\nshe had regarding Ruser’s management of the clinical pro-\ngrams, focusing on “the environment created for women in\nthe clinical programs over the years” by Ruser and his male\nassociates. Knapp alleged that after listening to Knapp’s con-\ncerns, the dean “did not offer to help in any way but wished\n[Knapp] well.” Knapp’s employment in the clinic ended on\nMay 31, 2013.\n                 2. Federal District Court’s\n                     Disposition of Claims\n   The federal district court concluded that because of sover-\neign immunity, it lacked jurisdiction to hear four of Knapp’s\n\f                              - 645 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nclaims: the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth. Those four claims\nwere based on state law, and the federal court found that the\nstate statutory schemes underlying the claims were not “suf-\nficiently explicit to effect a waiver of sovereign immunity to\nsuit in federal court.” Knapp v. Ruser, 145 F. Supp. 3d 846, 855\n(D. Neb. 2015). The federal court therefore remanded the four\nclaims for further proceedings in the state district court.\n   The federal court determined that the six remaining claims—\nthe first through third, sixth, eighth, and tenth—were asserted\nunder federal law and that Congress had abrogated states’ sov-\nereign immunity for those claims. The court stated that five of\nthe claims arose under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e (2012) (Title VII), and that the remain-\ning claim arose under the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)\n(2012) (EPA). The federal district court considered the six\nclaims. It found merit to the defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment and dismissed the six claims.\n   The federal court stated that Knapp’s first claim was fash-\nioned as a claim of disparate impact under Title VII. The court\ndetermined that Knapp’s disparate impact claim failed because\nshe had not alleged any facially neutral employment policy\nthat had a disparate impact on a protected class and instead\nhad alleged a practice that was not facially neutral. The court\ncharacterized Knapp’s allegations as an allegation of dispar­\nate treatment rather than disparate impact and concluded that\nKnapp had not pled a prima facie case for disparate impact.\nThe court therefore dismissed Knapp’s first claim.\n   The federal court next considered Knapp’s second, sixth,\nand eighth claims, which were fashioned as claims of dis-\nparate treatment and discrimination (the second and eighth\nclaims, respectively) under Title VII and a claim of wage\ndiscrimination under the EPA (the sixth claim). The court\nset forth the requirements of a prima facie claim of disparate\ntreatment or discrimination under Title VII and stated that a\nprima facie claim of wage discrimination under the EPA was\nsufficiently similar to examine the claims together. The court\nstated that in order to prevail on each of these claims, Knapp\n\f                              - 646 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nneeded to identify similarly situated males who were treated\ndifferently from her. Construing the facts in a light most favor-\nable to Knapp, the court determined that her claims failed\nbecause “she [had] not shown any similarly situated male\ncomparators who were treated differently.” Knapp, 145 F.\nSupp. 3d at 858. The court stated that by Knapp’s own admis-\nsion, the males to whom she compared herself performed\nwork or held duties that differed substantially from her own.\nSuch duties included directing clinical programs, undertaking\nacademic research, and performing community service, none\nof which were part of Knapp’s position, which focused solely\non teaching.\n   The federal court stated that although Knapp argued her\nTitle VII claims as failure to promote and wage discrimina-\ntion, the evidence she presented was more consistent with\na failure to hire. The court noted that Knapp compared her\nnontenured position to tenured positions held by male employ-\nees, and the court stated that “the uncontroverted evidence\n[was] that Knapp could only become eligible for tenure if she\nwere hired into a tenure-eligible position.” Knapp v. Ruser,\n145 F. Supp. 3d 846, 857 (D. Neb. 2015). The court consid-\nered Knapp’s claims as failure-to-hire claims but determined\nthat the claims still failed under such characterization. The\ncourt stated Knapp did not allege that she had applied for\nany tenure-eligible position or that anyone represented that\nher position would be eligible for tenure, and it stated that\ninstead the uncontroverted evidence was that Knapp and the\ncollege mutually understood that her position was not eligible\nfor tenure.\n   The federal court determined that “[t]he uncontroverted\nevidence . . . demonstrates that Knapp held a position with\nsubstantially different duties from her male colleagues” and\nthat “she never applied for a position similar to those they\nheld.” Id. at 859. The court concluded that Knapp “failed to\nallege facts sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that she\nsuffered less favorable treatment than the Defendants gave to\nsimilarly situated individuals outside of her protected class.”\n\f                              - 647 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nId. The court therefore dismissed Knapp’s second, sixth, and\neighth claims.\n   Knapp’s third claim was fashioned as a constructive dis-\ncharge claim under Title VII. The federal court rejected the\nclaim for two reasons. First, the court determined that Knapp\nhad not alleged facts sufficient for a jury to conclude that a\nreasonable person would have found the conditions of employ-\nment intolerable. The court noted that Ruser’s less frequent\ncommunication with Knapp, his personal slights against her,\nand his alleged disengagement from his own duties were not\nenough to create a cognizable constructive discharge claim.\nSecond, the court determined that although Knapp had aired\ncertain grievances with the dean, she did not give the law\nschool an opportunity to correct the problems before she\nresigned, and that her complaints were focused on long-term\nproblems in the clinic rather than her immediate problems with\nRuser. The court dismissed Knapp’s third claim.\n   For similar reasons, the court rejected Knapp’s tenth claim,\nwhich it characterized as an employment retaliation claim\nunder Title VII. The court determined that “a reasonable jury\ncould not conclude that Ruser’s alleged conduct constituted\nan adverse employment action.” Knapp, 145 F. Supp. 3d at\n861. The court stated that “Knapp acknowledge[d] that her\nstrained relationship with Ruser did not interfere with her abil-\nity to perform her duties” and that the evidence did not support\nher “assertion that Ruser’s alleged neglect of his own cases\nsomehow affected her duties.” Id. at 862. The court dismissed\nKnapp’s tenth claim.\n                   3. State Court’s Disposition\n                       of R emanded Claims\n   Having dismissed the six claims that were based on federal\nlaw, the federal district court remanded Knapp’s fourth, fifth,\nseventh, and ninth claims, which were based on state law, to\nthe state district court for further proceedings. On remand, the\ndefendants moved for summary judgment on those claims. The\nstate district court applied the familiar framework found in\n\f                              - 648 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct.\n1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), and after a hearing determined\nthat Knapp’s evidence failed to show a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination. The state district court sustained the defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment.\n   In its order ruling on the defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment, the district court began its analysis by noting that\nthree of the four remanded claims arose under Nebraska stat-\nutes that were patterned on analogous federal laws. The court\nstated that in Knapp’s fourth claim, she asserted a discrimina-\ntory wage practice claim under Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 48-1219\nthrough 48-1227.01 (Reissue 2010), which statutes the court\ncharacterized as the state equivalent of the federal EPA. The\ncourt stated that in her fifth and seventh claims, Knapp alleged\nviolations of the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice Act, Neb.\nRev. Stat. §§ 48-1101 through 48-1126 (Reissue 2010 & Cum.\nSupp. 2014) (NFEPA), which the court characterized as the\nstate equivalent of federal Title VII. The court noted that this\ncourt has held that Nebraska antidiscrimination laws are to be\ninterpreted in the same manner as their federal counterparts.\nThe court cited Nebraska appellate court cases looking to fed-\neral decisions construing Title VII for guidance to interpret the\nNFEPA. Extrapolating from the reasoning of those cases, the\ndistrict court concluded it should apply a similar approach and\nlooked to federal decisions construing the EPA for guidance\nregarding §§ 48-1219 through 48-1227.01.\n   The court first considered Knapp’s fourth claim, regard-\ning discriminatory wage practices, under §§ 48-1219 through\n48-1227.01. Using a rationale similar to that used by the\nfederal court when it rejected Knapp’s sixth claim, for wage\ndiscrimination under the EPA, the court rejected this claim.\nThe court indicated that the claim was specifically based on\n§ 48-1221(1). The court determined that Knapp had failed to\nshow any male employees who performed comparable work\nand that therefore, she could not establish a prima facie case\nof wage discrimination under § 48-1221(1). The court stated\nthat the male professor who was hired in March 2012 had\n\f                             - 649 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                  297 Nebraska R eports\n                        KNAPP v. RUSER\n                       Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nduties that Knapp did not have, mainly related to the task\nof creating a new entrepreneurship clinic. This task required\nhim to attend meetings with faculty and the dean and to per-\nform community outreach and academic research, as well\nas performing administrative tasks involved in establishing\nthe new clinic. The court determined that three other men to\nwhom Knapp compared herself were members of the college\nfaculty who had administrative and other duties that Knapp\ndid not have as a temporary member of the nontenured staff\nof the college. As a temporary lecturer, Knapp was assigned\nexclusively to teach students and did not have responsibilities\nto conduct academic research or perform community service.\nThe court also noted that Knapp had never applied for a posi-\ntion offering the possibility of tenure. The court granted sum-\nmary judgment in favor of the defendants on Knapp’s fourth\nclaim because she had not presented sufficient evidence of\ncomparable individuals to make a prima facie inference of\ndiscriminatory wages under § 48-1221(1).\n   The court next considered Knapp’s fifth claim, which it\ncharacterized as a claim of discrimination on the basis of\nsex under the NFEPA. The court determined that Knapp’s\ndiscrimination claim under the NFEPA failed for the same\nreason that her eighth claim, for discrimination under Title\nVII, had failed in the federal district court. The court noted\nthat the NFEPA mirrors Title VII and that in order to establish\na prima facie case for sex discrimination, a plaintiff needed\nto show, inter alia, that similarly situated males were treated\ndifferently. The court determined that Knapp had failed to\nidentify any similarly situated males who were treated dif-\nferently from her and that therefore, she had failed to show a\nprima facie case of discrimination under the NFEPA. The court\nalso addressed Knapp’s argument that the defendants failed\nto hire her for ­better-paying positions with the opportunity\nfor tenure. The court agreed with the federal district court’s\nanalysis to the effect that this argument failed because Knapp\nhad not presented any evidence that she had applied for any\ntenure-eligible positions. The court therefore granted summary\n\f                              - 650 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\njudgment in favor of the defendants on Knapp’s fifth claim, of\ndiscrimination under the NFEPA.\n    The court characterized Knapp’s seventh claim as a claim\nof employment retaliation under the NFEPA. Knapp argued\nthat Ruser had created a hostile work environment and had\nunreasonably interfered with her work performance after she\ncomplained to him regarding sex discrimination in the clinic.\nThe court rejected Knapp’s retaliation claim under the NFEPA\nbased on reasoning similar to that of the federal district court\nwhen it rejected Knapp’s tenth claim, of employment retali-\nation under Title VII. The court determined that Knapp had\nfailed to show that a reasonable person would have found the\nconditions of employment intolerable or that the defendants\neither intended to force her to resign or could have reason-\nably foreseen that she would do so as a result of their actions.\nThe court therefore granted summary judgment in favor of the\ndefendants on Knapp’s seventh claim, of employment retalia-\ntion under the NFEPA.\n    Finally, the court characterized Knapp’s ninth claim as a\npublic-policy-based claim of retaliation. Knapp alleged that\nthe defendants had retaliated against her “for attempting to\nprevent ethical issues in a learning setting for future lawyers\n. . . in contravention of public policy.” Knapp argued that the\ncivil clinic was a de facto law firm and that it was therefore\nsubject to duties required of law firms in Nebraska. The dis-\ntrict court cited Trosper v. Bag ’N Save, 273 Neb. 855, 734\nN.W.2d 704 (2007), and stated that this court has recognized\na public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine\nand that under the public policy exception, an employee may\nclaim damages for wrongful discharge when the motivation\nfor the firing contravenes public policy. The court rejected\nKnapp’s public policy retaliation claim for much the same\nreasons it rejected her claim of employment retaliation under\nthe NFEPA. The court determined that Knapp had “failed to\nshow how Ruser’s absence or refusal to communicate fol-\nlowing their heated conversation resulted in her discharge or\ndemotion.” The court noted that certain of Knapp’s concerns\n\f                              - 651 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nregarding Ruser’s management of the clinical programs “were\nlongstanding” and that she did not express those concerns to\nanyone in the college prior to April 2013. The court further\ndetermined that “even after Ruser became withdrawn, [Knapp]\nwas able to fulfill her ethical obligations and performance”\nin the clinic, and that there was “no evidence that Ruser’s\nwork on his own cases could compel a reasonable person in\n[Knapp’s] position to resign.” The court granted summary\njudgment in favor of the defendants on Knapp’s ninth claim,\nof public policy retaliation.\n   The district court concluded its order by stating that Knapp\nhad “failed to establish a prima facie case of wage discrimi-\nnation, failure to promote because of sex, retaliation, and\nretaliation in violation of public policy.” The court therefore\nsustained the defendants’ motion for summary judgment with\nrespect to Knapp’s fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth claims. The\ncourt overruled Knapp’s subsequent motion to alter or amend\nits judgment.\n   Knapp appeals the district court’s orders sustaining the\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment and overruling her\nmotion to alter or amend its judgment.\n                III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Knapp generally claims that the district court erred when it\nsustained the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on her\nfourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth claims and when it overruled\nher motion to alter or amend the judgment.\n   Knapp specifically claims, restated, that the district court\nerred when it (1) analyzed her fifth claim as a claim of fail-\nure to hire but failed to analyze it as a claim of impermis-\nsible classification under the NFEPA; (2) determined, with\nregard to her fifth claim, that she failed to show that there\nwere similarly situated male employees who were treated\ndifferently; (3) determined, with regard to her fourth claim,\nregarding wage discrimination under § 48-1221(1), that she\nfailed to show that there were male employees who performed\ncomparable duties; and (4) determined that she failed, with\n\f                              - 652 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nregard to both her seventh claim, of employment retaliation\nunder the NFEPA, and her ninth claim, of public-policy-\nbased retaliation, to show retaliatory or unreasonable conduct\nby Ruser.\n   We note that Knapp also claims that the federal district court\nerred when it sustained the defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment with respect to her first through third, sixth, eighth\nand tenth claims. She requests that we reverse the federal dis-\ntrict court’s order sustaining the defendants’ motion for sum-\nmary judgment on those claims. Under federal law, when a fed-\neral district court grants summary judgment on certain claims\nand remands the remaining claims to a state court, the federal\ndistrict court’s partial summary judgment becomes final as to\nthe claims on which the federal district court granted summary\njudgment and the federal district court’s resolution of those\nclaims is appealable to the federal circuit court. See Porter\nv. Williams, 436 F.3d 917 (8th Cir. 2006). The federal district\ncourt’s order in Knapp v. Ruser, 145 F. Supp. 3d 846 (D. Neb.\n2015), as a final judgment as to those claims upon which the\nfederal court granted summary judgment, is appealable to a\nfederal circuit court, and we do not review the federal district\ncourt’s resolution of those claims.\n                 IV. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   [1,2] An appellate court will affirm a lower court’s grant\nof summary judgment if the pleadings and admitted evidence\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material facts or\nas to the ultimate inferences that may be drawn from those\nfacts and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law. Thomas v. Board of Trustees, 296 Neb. 726,\n895 N.W.2d 692 (2017). In reviewing a summary judgment, an\nappellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the party against whom the judgment was granted and gives\nthat party the benefit of all reasonable inferences deducible\nfrom the evidence.

ANALYSIS\n   Knapp generally claims that the district court erred when\nit sustained the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on\nher fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth claims generally for the\nreason that Knapp’s evidence failed to show a prima facie case\nof discrimination, see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\nU.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), and when\nit overruled her motion to alter or amend the judgment. She\nalso assigns specific errors, each of which relates to one or\nmore of the claims. We will review the district court’s ruling\nas to each claim and Knapp’s specific arguments as to each\nclaim in turn.\n                  1. Fifth Claim: Discrimination\n                         Under the NFEPA\n    Knapp’s fifth claim was based on the NFEPA. The district\ncourt analyzed Knapp’s fifth claim as a claim of discrimi-\nnation based on sex under the NFEPA; the court specifi-\ncally addressed Knapp’s arguments that it characterized as a\n­failure-to-hire claim. On appeal, Knapp makes two main argu-\n ments with regard to her fifth claim: (1) that the district court\n erred when it failed to analyze the fifth claim as a claim of\n improper classification under the NFEPA and (2) that the\n court erred when it determined that she had failed to show\n similarly situated male employees who were treated differ-\n ently. Knapp claims that because of these errors, the district\n court erred when it sustained the defendants’ motion for sum-\n mary judgment on her fifth claim and that the court abused\n its discretion when it overruled her motion to alter or amend\n the judgment in order to consider the fifth claim as a claim of\n improper classification.\n    [4] We note first that we have stated that the NFEPA is pat-\n terned after federal Title VII and that it is appropriate to look\n to federal court decisions construing Title VII for guidance\n\f                             - 654 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                  297 Nebraska R eports\n                        KNAPP v. RUSER\n                       Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nwith respect to the NFEPA. See Hartley v. Metropolitan\nUtil. Dist., 294 Neb. 870, 885 N.W.2d 675 (2016). Like the\nplaintiff’s claim in Hartley, Knapp’s fifth claim is a claim of\ndisparate treatment, that is, “a claim based on an employer’s\ntreating some people less favorably than others because of\ntheir race, color, religion, sex, or other protected character-\nistics.” 294 Neb. at 891, 885 N.W.2d at 692-93. In Hartley,\nwe looked to federal case law applying Title VII, specifically\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., supra, to provide a framework\nfor a discrimination claim under the NFEPA. We noted in\nHartley that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. framework is not\nthe exclusive method of proving disparate treatment, but in\nthis case, as in Hartley, the district court used that frame-\nwork and the parties do not dispute that it was the appropri-\nate approach.\n   The first step under the McDonnell Douglas Corp. frame-\nwork is that “first the plaintiff has the burden of proving a\nprima facie case of discrimination.” Hartley, 294 Neb. at\n893, 885 N.W.2d at 693. In Hartley, the plaintiff set forth a\nfailure-to-promote claim, and therefore, we stated that a prima\nfacie case of discrimination in that case consisted of “demon-\nstrating (1) the employee is a member of a protected group,\n(2) the employee was qualified and applied for a promotion\nto an available position, (3) the employee was rejected, and\n(4) a similarly situated employee, not part of the protected\ngroup, was promoted instead.” 294 Neb. at 893, 885 N.W.2d\nat 693.\n   [5,6] We note, however, that courts typically modify the\nformulation of a prima facie case of employment discrimina-\ntion based on the specific type of discrimination claimed in a\nspecific case. Although the requirements set forth in Hartley\nfocused on a claim of failure to promote, the Nebraska Court\nof Appeals in Helvering v. Union Pacific RR. Co., 13 Neb.\nApp. 818, 703 N.W.2d 134 (2005), set forth a more univer-\nsal formulation of the required showing for a prima facie\ncase of gender discrimination. The Court of Appeals stated\nthat a “prima facie case of gender discrimination requires\n\f                               - 655 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                          KNAPP v. RUSER\n                         Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nthe plaintiff to prove that he or she (1) is a member of a\nprotected class, (2) was qualified to perform the job, (3) suf-\nfered an adverse employment action, and (4) was treated dif-\nferently from similarly situated persons of the opposite sex.”\nHelvering, 13 Neb. App. at 842, 703 N.W.2d at 154 (citing\nRiggs v. County of Banner, 159 F. Supp. 2d 1158 (D. Neb.\n2001) (considering Title VII claim of discrimination based\non sex)). The Court of Appeals further stated that the test to\ndetermine whether employees are similarly situated to war-\nrant a comparison to a plaintiff is a rigorous one and that the\nplaintiff has the burden of demonstrating that there were indi-\nviduals similarly situated in all relevant aspects to the plaintiff\nby a preponderance of the evidence. Helvering, supra (citing\nE.E.O.C. v. Kohler Co., 335 F.3d 766 (8th Cir. 2003) (consid-\nering Title VII retaliation claim based on race)).\n                         (a) Classification\n   Knapp claims that the district court erred because it failed\nto analyze her fifth claim as a claim of improper classification\nunder the NFEPA. She raises this argument in connection with\nher claims of error with respect to the court’s grant of summary\njudgment and its overruling of her motion to alter or amend\nthe judgment.\n   Knapp’s fifth claim was based on § 48-1104, which is part\nof the NFEPA and which provides as follows:\n         It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n      employer:\n         (1) To fail or refuse to hire, to discharge, or to harass\n      any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any\n      individual with respect to compensation, terms, condi-\n      tions, or privileges of employment, because of such indi-\n      vidual’s race, color, religion, sex, disability, marital sta-\n      tus, or national origin; or\n         (2) To limit, advertise, solicit, segregate, or classify\n      employees in any way which would deprive or tend to\n      deprive any individual of employment opportunities or\n      otherwise adversely affect such individual’s status as an\n\f                               - 656 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                          KNAPP v. RUSER\n                         Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\n      employee, because of such individual’s race, color, reli-\n      gion, sex, disability, marital status, or national origin.\nKnapp maintains that the district court analyzed her fifth\nclaim as a claim under only § 48-1104(1), which makes\nit an unlawful employment practice to, inter alia, “fail or\nrefuse to hire . . . or otherwise to discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to compensation . . . because of such\nindividual’s . . . sex.” She contends that the court should have\nalso analyzed the claim as a claim under § 48-1104(2), which\nmakes it an unlawful employment practice to, inter alia, “clas-\nsify employees in any way which would deprive or tend to\ndeprive any individual of employment opportunities or other-\nwise adversely affect such individual’s status as an employee,\nbecause of such individual’s . . . sex.”\n   In support of her contention that the court analyzed the\nclaim only under subsection (1) and not under subsection (2),\nKnapp focuses on the portion of the district court’s summary\njudgment analysis in which it considered the failure-to-hire\naspects of the fifth claim. However, in addition to consider-\ning the claim specifically as a failure-to-hire claim, the district\ncourt also analyzed the claim as a more generalized claim of\ndiscrimination utilizing the framework of McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668\n(1973). Knapp contends that she showed a prima facie case of\nimproper classification under that framework, and she does not\noffer an alternative approach.\n   Although Knapp used “classification” language in her com-\nplaint, and we acknowledge that the district court did not\nspecifically refer to her fifth claim as one of improper “clas-\nsification,” this is of no legal consequence. We believe that a\nclaim of improper classification under § 48-1104(2) is subject\nto the McDonnell Douglas Corp. framework and that in such\na case, the “adverse employment action” is an improper clas-\nsification, which must be demonstrated by evidence of prima\nfacie discrimination. In this case, the district court used the\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. framework and determined that\nKnapp had failed to show that there were similarly situated\n\f                              - 657 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nmale employees who were treated differently. As a con-\nsequence of this determination, the court effectively deter-\nmined that Knapp had failed to show similarly situated male\nemployees who were classified differently than she was and\nthat therefore, she failed to show a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination resulting from an improper classification under\n§ 48-1104(2).\n                      (b) Similarly Situated\n   Knapp further argues that the court erred when it determined\nwith respect to her fifth claim that she failed to show simi-\nlarly situated male employees who were treated differently.\nAs noted above, this finding was dispositive of the improper\nclassification aspects of Knapp’s claim as well as the other\naspects of the claim. Knapp argues that she presented evidence\nof similarly situated males because she presented evidence that\nmale employees were moved from nontenure positions into\ntenure track positions with higher pay.\n   The district court determined that Knapp failed to show\nsimilarly situated males because the males to whom she com-\npared herself had duties that were different from or in addition\nto the duties that she performed. Because Knapp did not show\nthe existence of males who were similarly situated, she could\nnot show that males were treated differently. Any differences\nin compensation or classification could be explained by the\ndifferences in duties.\n   Knapp argues that the men were treated differently because\nthey moved on to tenure track positions. But when the men\nmoved on to such positions, they took on additional duties\nand therefore were no longer similarly situated. Therefore,\nto the extent that Knapp compares herself to male employees\nwho moved on to tenure track positions while she did not, her\nargument is no longer that she was treated differently from\nsimilarly situated male employees. Instead, her argument is\nmore properly characterized as a failure to promote or a fail-\nure to hire claim because she is arguing the male employees\nwere able to move into tenure positions while she was not.\n\f                              - 658 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nThe district court analyzed Knapp’s fifth claim as a failure to\nhire claim, and the court determined that the claim failed as\nsuch because Knapp did not show that she had attempted to\nobtain a tenure track position and therefore could not show that\nthe defendants refused to hire her for or promote her to such\na position.\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Knapp,\nwe find she did not present evidence of similarly situated males,\nand therefore, she was unable to show under § 48-1104(1) that\nthey were treated differently, whether such different treatment\nwas with respect to compensation, classification, or hiring for\nor promotion to tenure track positions.\n   We conclude that with respect to Knapp’s fifth claim under\n§ 48-1104(1) and (2), the district court did not err when it\nreached the determinations noted above and sustained the\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment and overruled\nKnapp’s subsequent motion to alter or amend challenging such\ndeterminations.\n                2. Fourth Claim: Discriminatory\n                  Wage Practices Based on Sex\n   Knapp’s fourth claim was a claim of wage discrimination\nbased on sex under §§ 48-1219 through 48-1227.01. The\ndistrict court determined that Knapp had failed to identify a\nmale employee with comparable duties and therefore had not\nshown that a male employee performing the same duties was\npaid more. Knapp claims that the district court erred when it\ndetermined that she failed to show male employees who had\ncomparable duties.\n   [7] As an initial matter, we note that the specific statute\nthat underlies Knapp’s fourth claim is § 48-1221(1), which\nprovides:\n      No employer shall discriminate between employees in the\n      same establishment on the basis of sex, by paying wages\n      to any employee in such establishment at a wage rate less\n      than the rate at which the employer pays any employee\n      of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work\n\f                              - 659 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\n      on jobs which require equal skill, effort and responsibil-\n      ity under similar working conditions. Wage differentials\n      are not within this prohibition where such payments are\n      made pursuant to: (a) An established seniority system; (b)\n      a merit increase system; or (c) a system which measures\n      earning by quantity or quality of production or any factor\n      other than sex.\nKnapp’s sixth claim, which was dismissed by the federal dis-\ntrict court, was a claim of wage discrimination under the fed-\neral EPA, 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1), which provides:\n      No employer having employees subject to any provisions\n      of this section shall discriminate, within any establish-\n      ment in which such employees are employed, between\n      employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to\n      employees in such establishment at a rate less than the\n      rate at which he pays wages to employees of the oppo-\n      site sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs the\n      performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and\n      responsibility, and which are performed under similar\n      working conditions, except where such payment is made\n      pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system;\n      (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or\n      quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any\n      other factor other than sex: Provided, That an employer\n      who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of\n      this subsection shall not, in order to comply with the\n      provisions of this subsection, reduce the wage rate of\n      any employee.\nThe state and federal statutes are similar, and the Nebraska stat-\nute appears to be patterned after the federal statute. Therefore,\nsimilarly to our holding in Hartley v. Metropolitan Util. Dist.,\n294 Neb. 870, 885 N.W.2d 675 (2016), noted above with\nregard to the NFEPA and Title VII, we hold that because\n§ 48-1221(1) is patterned after the federal EPA, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 206(d), it is appropriate to look to federal court decisions\nconstruing 29 U.S.C. § 206(d) for guidance with respect to\n§ 48-1221(1).\n\f                              - 660 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\n   The district court in this case looked to federal court deci-\nsions construing the federal EPA when it analyzed Knapp’s\nfourth claim. The court cited Price v. Northern States Power\nCo., 664 F.3d 1186, 1191 (8th Cir. 2011), in which the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit stated that when\nbringing a claim of pay discrimination on the basis of sex\npursuant to the federal EPA, “[a] plaintiff must first establish\na prima facie case that women were paid less than men in\nthe same establishment for equal work requiring equal skill,\neffort, and responsibility and performed under similar work-\ning conditions” and that “[i]f a plaintiff establishes a prima\nfacie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to prove\none of [the] statutory affirmative defenses.” We note that in\nHunt v. Nebraska Public Power Dist., 282 F.3d 1021 (8th Cir.\n2002), the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit formulated\nthe prima facie case under the EPA as follows: To establish an\nequal pay claim, a plaintiff must show by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that (1) she was paid less than a male employed\nin the same establishment; (2) for equal work on jobs requir-\ning equal skill, effort, and responsibility; (3) which were per-\nformed under similar working conditions.\n   [8] We believe that the framework applicable to a federal\nEPA claim is also the proper framework to be applied to a\nclaim under § 48-1221(1) for wage discrimination based on\nsex. Therefore, when bringing a claim of wage discrimina-\ntion based on sex under § 48-1221(1), a plaintiff must first\nestablish a prima facie case by showing by a preponderance\nof the evidence that (1) the plaintiff was paid less than a per-\nson of the opposite sex employed in the same establishment;\n(2) for equal work on jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and\nresponsibility; (3) which were performed under similar work-\ning conditions. If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of\nwage discrimination based on sex, the burden then shifts to the\ndefendant to prove one of the affirmative defenses set forth in\n§ 48-1221(1).\n   Using this general framework to analyze Knapp’s fourth\nclaim, the district court concluded that Knapp had not\n\f                              - 661 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nestablished a prima facie case of wage discrimination, because\nshe had not shown that the male employees to whom she com-\npared herself were performing comparable duties. The court\ndetermined that “[a]lthough all faculty named by Knapp as\ncomparators also taught in the clinics as part of their posi-\ntions, the totality of their duties were [sic] not substantially\nequal.” The court noted that while their positions shared cer-\ntain duties that Knapp performed, each of the male employees\nhad additional responsibilities including some combination of\nclassroom teaching, research, and service to the faculty, admin-\nistration, and community.\n   In terms of the requirements of a prima facie case of wage\ndiscrimination based on sex set forth above, we read the dis-\ntrict court’s determinations as a ruling that Knapp failed to\nshow a male employee who was doing “equal work on jobs\nrequiring equal skill, effort, and responsibility.” See Hunt v.\nNebraska Public Power Dist., 282 F.3d 1021, 1029 (8th Cir.\n2002). Specifically, the court determined that the male employ-\nees to whom Knapp compared herself performed work that\nrequired additional responsibilities.\n   In this regard, we note that the Eighth Circuit Court of\nAppeals in Hunt explained the required showing of “equal\nwork” by stating that the jobs need not be identical to be\nconsidered “‘equal’” under the EPA and they need only\nbe substantially equal. 282 F.3d at 1029. The court further\nstated that neither job classifications nor titles are disposi-\ntive for determining whether jobs are equal for purposes of\nthe EPA and that determining whether two jobs are substan-\ntially equal requires a practical judgment on the basis of all\nthe facts and circumstances of a particular case, including\nfactors such as level of experience, training, education, abil-\nity, effort, and responsibility. Hunt, supra. The court further\nstated that two jobs could require insubstantial or minor\ndifferences in the degree or amount of skill, or effort, or\nresponsibility and still be substantially equal. Id. We find\nthese standards to be sound, and we adopt them and apply\nthem to this case.\n\f                              - 662 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\n   With these considerations in mind, we determine that\nKnapp’s evidence did not show that the male employees to\nwhom she compared herself were doing “equal work . . .\nrequiring equal . . . responsibility.” See Hunt, 282 F.3d at 1029.\nThe evidence showed that the male employees had additional\nresponsibilities that were not insubstantial or minor differences\nfrom the work Knapp was doing. We conclude therefore that\nthe district court did not err when it sustained the defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment on Knapp’s fourth claim; nor\ndid the court abuse its discretion when it overruled Knapp’s\nmotion to alter or amend such judgment.\n                 3. Seventh Claim: R etaliation\n                        Under the NFEPA\n   Knapp’s seventh claim was a claim of retaliation under the\nNFEPA. Knapp claims on appeal that the district court erred\nin its determination that she had failed to show that a reason-\nable person would have found the conditions of employment\nintolerable or that the defendants either intended to force her\nto resign or could have reasonably foreseen that she would do\nso as a result of their actions.\n   [9] A claim of retaliation under the NFEPA is based on\n§ 48-1114, which provides in relevant part that “[i]t shall be\nan unlawful employment practice for an employer to discrimi-\nnate against any of his or her employees . . . because he or she\n. . . has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment\npractice by the [NFEPA].” The Nebraska Court of Appeals in\nHelvering v. Union Pacific RR. Co., 13 Neb. App. 818, 703\nN.W.2d 134 (2005), noted that the framework for a claim of\nretaliation under the NFEPA is the framework of McDonnell\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36\nL. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), used for other unlawful employment\npractice claims under the NFEPA as set forth above in con-\nnection with our analysis of Knapp’s fifth claim. The Court\nof Appeals for the Eighth Circuit set forth the formulation\nof a prima facie case in a retaliation claim as being that a\nplaintiff must establish such case by showing (1) he or she\n\f                              - 663 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nengaged in protected conduct, (2) he or she was subjected to\nan adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal con-\nnection between the protected conduct and the adverse action.\nSee Wood v. SatCom Marketing, LLC, 705 F.3d 823 (8th Cir.\n2013). The same formulation applies to set forth a prima facie\ncase of retaliation under § 48-1114.\n   Knapp’s claim of retaliation under the NFEPA was that\nshe had engaged in a protected activity when she opposed\npractices by Ruser that she alleged amounted to discrimina-\ntion based on sex. The district court determined that the claim\nfailed because Knapp had not shown that she “‘suffered an\nadverse employment decision.’” Knapp did not allege that the\nlaw school had terminated her employment because she had\ncomplained to Ruser or to the dean; instead, she argued that\nafter she complained to Ruser, he created an environment that\ndrove her to leave her employment. The district court deter-\nmined that Knapp’s evidence on summary judgment regard-\ning Ruser’s behavior did not rise to the level of an adverse\nemployment action.\n   [10] To satisfy the “adverse employment action” require-\nment in a retaliation claim, see Helvering, 13 Neb. App. at\n842, 703 N.W.2d at 154, a plaintiff must show that “a rea-\nsonable employee would have found the challenged action\nmaterially adverse,” see Burlington N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White,\n548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006).\nThis, in turn, requires a showing that the employment action\n“‘might have “dissuaded . . .”’” a reasonable worker from\nreporting the alleged unlawful practice. Id. To meet this bur-\nden, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the employment action\nwas material, not trivial, and that it resulted in some concrete\n“‘injury or harm.’” AuBuchon v. Geithner, 743 F.3d 638, 644\n(8th Cir. 2014). In this regard, it has been noted that report-\ning discriminatory behavior “‘cannot immunize that employee\nfrom those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take\nplace at work and that all employees experience.’” Id. (quoting\nWhite, supra).\n\f                              - 664 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\n   Viewing Knapp’s evidence in the light most favorable to her\nand applying the standards set forth above, we determine that\nKnapp did not show the sort of “adverse employment action”\nnecessary to support a claim of retaliation under § 48-1114\nof the NFEPA. Ruser’s alleged change in attitude and the\nbehaviors he displayed after Knapp raised concerns regard-\ning gender discrimination are more properly characterized as\n“petty slights” and “minor annoyances” than as the sort of\nactions a reasonable employee would have found to be materi-\nally adverse and that would have resulted in some concrete\ninjury or harm. We therefore conclude that the district court\ndid not err when it sustained the defendants’ motion for sum-\nmary judgment as to Knapp’s seventh claim nor did the court\nabuse its discretion when it overruled Knapp’s motion to alter\nor amend such judgment.\n           4. Ninth Claim: Public Policy R etaliation\n   Finally, Knapp’s ninth claim was a claim of retaliation based\non public policy considerations. Similar to its disposition of\nthe seventh claim, the district court rejected this claim on the\nbasis that Knapp’s evidence did not show material retaliatory\nconduct. Knapp claims on appeal that the district court erred\nin this determination because, she argues, she and Ruser were\n“de facto law partners” and because ethical concerns relating\nto law firms give rise to a public policy claim and require that\na different standard be used to determine whether there was\nretaliation. Brief for appellant at 33.\n   [11] Knapp argues that her ninth claim is cognizable as a\n“tort-based claim for retaliation when it violates public policy,”\nid. at 31, and she cites Trosper v. Bag ’N Save, 273 Neb. 855,\n734 N.W.2d 704 (2007), as support for this theory. In Trosper,\nwe recognized that generally, an employer may terminate the\nemployment of an at-will employee at any time, but we rec-\nognized a public policy exception to the at-will employment\ndoctrine. We described the exception as follows:\n      Under the public policy exception, we will allow an\n      employee to claim damages for wrongful discharge when\n\f                              - 665 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         KNAPP v. RUSER\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\n      the motivation for the firing contravenes public policy.\n      The public policy exception is restricted to cases when\n      a clear mandate of public policy has been violated, and\n      it should be limited to manageable and clear standards.\n      In determining whether a clear mandate of public policy\n      is violated, courts should inquire whether the employer’s\n      conduct contravenes the letter or purpose of a constitu-\n      tional, statutory, or regulatory provision or scheme.\nTrosper, 273 Neb. at 857-58, 734 N.W.2d at 707. The specific\nexception noted in Trosper originated in Jackson v. Morris\nCommunications Corp., 265 Neb. 423, 657 N.W.2d 634 (2003),\nwhere we recognized a public policy exception to the at-will\nemployment doctrine and allowed an action for retaliatory\ndischarge when an employee has been discharged for filing\na workers’ compensation claim. Trosper extended Jackson to\ninclude a claim for retaliatory demotion for filing a workers’\ncompensation claim.\n   Knapp argues that a public policy exception should be rec-\nognized to allow her ninth claim and that the public policy\nsupporting her claim consists of ethical considerations gov-\nerning the legal profession and law firms as expressed in the\nNebraska Rules of Professional Conduct. She contends that\nthe defend­ants retaliated against her because she raised ethical\nconcerns regarding Ruser’s conduct at the civil clinic.\n   Whether or not a public policy exception related to such\nethical concerns should be recognized, we note that in cases\nlike Trosper, the public policy exception is fashioned as an\nexception to the at-will employment doctrine. As such, the\nexception has been limited to claims of retaliatory discharge\nand, as extended in Trosper, claims of retaliatory demotion.\nKnapp’s evidence does not show that the defendants either dis-\ncharged or demoted her after she raised ethical concerns; nor\ndoes it show a constructive discharge or some other adverse\nemployment action that falls short of a discharge or demo-\ntion. As we noted in connection with Knapp’s seventh claim\nfor retaliation under the NFEPA, Knapp has not shown any\n\f                             - 666 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                  297 Nebraska R eports\n                        KNAPP v. RUSER\n                       Cite as 297 Neb. 639\n\nadverse employment action that was material and that resulted\nin some concrete injury or harm.\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Knapp,\nwe determine she has not shown employment-related retali-\nation that would give rise to a claim based on public policy.\nTherefore, we conclude that the district court did not err when\nit sustained the defendants’ motion for summary judgment\non Knapp’s ninth claim; nor did the court abuse its discre-\ntion when it overruled Knapp’s motion to alter or amend\nsuch judgment.\n                       VI. CONCLUSION\n   We conclude that the district court did not err when it sus-\ntained the defendants’ motion for summary judgment with\nrespect to Knapp’s fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth claims and\nthat it did not abuse its discretion when it overruled Knapp’s\nsubsequent motion to alter or amend its judgment. We there-\nfore affirm the district court’s orders.\n                                                    A ffirmed.\n   Stacy, J., not participating.\n\f",

Stat. § 48-1221(1) (Reissue 2010), a plaintiff must first establish\n     a prima facie case by showing by a preponderance of the evidence\n     that (1) the plaintiff was paid less than a person of the opposite sex\n     employed in the same establishment; (2) for equal work on jobs requir-\n     ing equal skill, effort, and responsibility; (3) which were performed\n     under similar working conditions. If a plaintiff establishes a prima\n     facie case of wage discrimination based on sex, the burden then shifts\n     to the defendant to prove one of the affirmative defenses set forth in\n     § 48-1221(1).\n 9.\t Fair Employment Practices: Proof. A plaintiff must establish a prima\n     facie case of retaliation under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 48-1114 (Reissue 2010)\n     by showing (1) he or she engaged in protected conduct, (2) he or she\n     was subjected to an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a\n     causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse action.\n10.\t ____: ____. To satisfy the adverse employment action requirement in\n     a retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee\n     would have found the challenged action materially adverse. This, in turn,\n     requires a showing that the employment action might have dissuaded a\n     reasonable worker from reporting the alleged unlawful practice. To meet\n     this burden, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the employment action\n     was material, not trivial, and that it resulted in some concrete injury\n     or harm.\n11.\t Claims: Fair Employment Practices: Public Policy: Damages. Under\n     the public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine, an\n     employee may claim damages for wrongful discharge when the moti-\n     vation for the firing contravenes public policy. The public policy\n     exception is restricted to cases when a clear mandate of public policy\n     has been violated, and it should be limited to manageable and clear\n     standards. In determining whether a clear mandate of public policy is\n     violated, courts should inquire whether the employer’s conduct contra-\n     venes the letter or purpose of a constitutional, statutory, or regulatory\n     provision or scheme.\n\n  Appeal from the District Court for Lancaster County:\nHoracio J.

NATURE OF CASE\n   Patricia A. Knapp filed an action against Kevin Ruser, in his\nofficial capacity, and the Board of Regents of the University\nof Nebraska in which she asserted claims of discriminatory\nwage and employment practices based on her sex as well as\nclaims of employment retaliation. Knapp’s claims arose from\nalleged occurrences while she was a supervising attorney for\nthe civil clinical law program at the University of Nebraska\nCollege of Law. Knapp appeals the orders of the district\ncourt for Lancaster County in which the court sustained the\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment and overruled her\nmotion to alter or amend the judgment. We affirm the district\ncourt’s orders.\n                  II. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   Knapp commenced this action with a complaint filed in\nthe district court on July 11, 2014. In that complaint, Knapp\nset forth eight claims for relief, some based on state law and\nsome based on federal law. In August, the defendants had\nthe action removed to the U.S. District Court for the District\nof Nebraska. In November 2015, the federal court sustained\nthe defendants’ motion for summary judgment in part and\ndismissed certain of Knapp’s claims, which were based on\nfederal law, with prejudice. The federal court remanded the\nremaining claims, which were based on Nebraska state law,\nto the district court for Lancaster County for further proceed-\nings. Knapp v.

In the amended complaint,\nshe set forth 10 claims for relief. The federal court had dis-\nmissed the first through third, sixth, eighth, and tenth claims.\nAlso, it remanded the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth claims\nfor further proceedings in the state court. Accordingly, our\nconsideration on appeal is limited to the state district court’s\ndisposition of four claims identified in the operative complaint\nas the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth claims.\n                     1. Background/Facts\n   Knapp, an attorney, began working in the civil clinic as a\ntemporary half-time employee in the summer of 1999. At that\ntime, the director of clinical programs was on a sabbatical,\nand Knapp was hired to cover the portion of his responsibili-\nties that concerned the civil clinic. After the director returned\nfrom sabbatical and informed the college that he would be\nleaving at the end of the fall semester, Knapp was hired as a\ntemporary half-time employee beginning in the spring 2000\nsemester. The understanding was that she would cover the\nformer director’s duties with respect to the civil clinic while\nthe law school considered its long-term strategic plan for the\nclinical programs.\n   Knapp’s half-time employment in the civil clinic ended\nin August 2004 after Ruser was named director of the clini-\ncal programs and the law school hired Richard Moberly to\nperform the duties Knapp had performed in the civil clinic.\nIn 2006, the law school again hired Knapp as a half-time\nemployee in the civil clinic after it determined that Moberly’s\nhalf-time status was not sufficient to meet student needs.\nWhile Knapp and Moberly split duties in the civil clinic,\nMoberly held a full-time position which included additional\nresponsibilities such as teaching doctrinal classes, research,\nand community service.\n   Knapp continued to work half-time in the civil clinic until\nAugust 2011, when Moberly became an associate dean of the\nlaw school and gave up his duties in the civil clinic.

Knapp’s\nposition was classified as that of “Temporary Lecturer” and\nwas designated as a “‘Special Appointment.’” Knapp met\nwith the dean of the law school to discuss her full-time sal-\nary; the dean offered Knapp an annual salary of $80,000.\nAfter Knapp told the dean that the salary was low, the dean\ntold Knapp that she would explore the possibility of increas-\ning the salary by seeking a designation for the position as a\n“‘professor of practice.’” Knapp agreed to accept the salary\nfor the upcoming academic year based on what she believed\nto be the dean’s “good-faith commitment” to find a way to\nincrease her salary. When Knapp told Ruser the salary she\nhad been offered, Ruser told her that the dean had “‘low-\nballed’” her.\n   A year later, in August 2012, Ruser left a letter for Knapp\nsetting forth proposed terms and conditions for her employ-\nment in the upcoming academic year. The letter stated that\nher salary would again be $80,000. Prior to receiving the\nletter, Knapp had had no other communication with the law\nschool’s administration regarding her salary for the upcom-\ning year. The letter prompted Knapp to check the salaries of\nothers working in the clinical programs. She learned from the\nUniversity of Nebraska’s website that a male professor had\nbeen hired in March 2012 to teach a business transactions\nclinic at a salary of $106,000 per year. Knapp thereafter spoke\nwith Ruser regarding her salary, and she told him that after\nseeing others’ salaries, she thought that the salary structure in\nthe clinical programs was “skewed” and that the clinics had a\n“‘gender equity’ problem” that Ruser needed to address. Ruser\nresponded that he was “‘baffled’” by Knapp’s allegations of\ndiscrimination and that the new male professor’s higher sal-\nary was justified by the fact that his position was a tenure\ntrack position.\n   Knapp alleged that the conversation became heated and\nthat afterward, Ruser’s behavior and demeanor toward her\nchanged.

Knapp\nalso observed that Ruser appeared to be neglecting his own\nduties in the clinic, including supervision of students and\ncases. After adopting a child in the spring semester, Ruser\nwent to half time, and Knapp alleged that he “disengaged\neven further” from the clinic, with the result being that the\nclinic “was not fulfilling its ethical obligations to its clients\nor to its students.”\n   In April 2013, Knapp learned that Ruser would be receiving\na lifetime achievement award from the law school. Although\nother members of the clinic’s staff had known of the award\nfor several weeks and had been invited to sit at Ruser’s table\nat the award ceremony, Ruser had not mentioned the award\nto Knapp. This incident prompted Knapp to conclude that her\nrelationship with Ruser “was so badly damaged that it had\nbecome impossible for them to work together as law partners\nin a way that would meet their ethical obligations to their cli-\nents and to their students.”\n   Knapp decided to leave her job at the clinic, but a coworker\nencouraged her to speak with the dean about what was happen-\ning in the clinic. Knapp met with the dean and informed her of\nseveral problems that she perceived in the clinic. Knapp told\nthe dean that problems had existed for women in the clinical\nprogram since the early 1980’s, when Knapp was a student\nat the college. Knapp informed the dean of various concerns\nshe had regarding Ruser’s management of the clinical pro-\ngrams, focusing on “the environment created for women in\nthe clinical programs over the years” by Ruser and his male\nassociates. Knapp alleged that after listening to Knapp’s con-\ncerns, the dean “did not offer to help in any way but wished\n[Knapp] well.” Knapp’s employment in the clinic ended on\nMay 31, 2013.\n                 2.

The federal court therefore remanded the four\nclaims for further proceedings in the state district court.\n   The federal court determined that the six remaining claims—\nthe first through third, sixth, eighth, and tenth—were asserted\nunder federal law and that Congress had abrogated states’ sov-\nereign immunity for those claims. The court stated that five of\nthe claims arose under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e (2012) (Title VII), and that the remain-\ning claim arose under the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)\n(2012) (EPA). The federal district court considered the six\nclaims. It found merit to the defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment and dismissed the six claims.\n   The federal court stated that Knapp’s first claim was fash-\nioned as a claim of disparate impact under Title VII. The court\ndetermined that Knapp’s disparate impact claim failed because\nshe had not alleged any facially neutral employment policy\nthat had a disparate impact on a protected class and instead\nhad alleged a practice that was not facially neutral. The court\ncharacterized Knapp’s allegations as an allegation of dispar­\nate treatment rather than disparate impact and concluded that\nKnapp had not pled a prima facie case for disparate impact.\nThe court therefore dismissed Knapp’s first claim.\n   The federal court next considered Knapp’s second, sixth,\nand eighth claims, which were fashioned as claims of dis-\nparate treatment and discrimination (the second and eighth\nclaims, respectively) under Title VII and a claim of wage\ndiscrimination under the EPA (the sixth claim). The court\nset forth the requirements of a prima facie claim of disparate\ntreatment or discrimination under Title VII and stated that a\nprima facie claim of wage discrimination under the EPA was\nsufficiently similar to examine the claims together.

The court stated that by Knapp’s own admis-\nsion, the males to whom she compared herself performed\nwork or held duties that differed substantially from her own.\nSuch duties included directing clinical programs, undertaking\nacademic research, and performing community service, none\nof which were part of Knapp’s position, which focused solely\non teaching.\n   The federal court stated that although Knapp argued her\nTitle VII claims as failure to promote and wage discrimina-\ntion, the evidence she presented was more consistent with\na failure to hire. The court noted that Knapp compared her\nnontenured position to tenured positions held by male employ-\nees, and the court stated that “the uncontroverted evidence\n[was] that Knapp could only become eligible for tenure if she\nwere hired into a tenure-eligible position.” Knapp v.

The\ncourt stated Knapp did not allege that she had applied for\nany tenure-eligible position or that anyone represented that\nher position would be eligible for tenure, and it stated that\ninstead the uncontroverted evidence was that Knapp and the\ncollege mutually understood that her position was not eligible\nfor tenure.\n   The federal court determined that “[t]he uncontroverted\nevidence . . . demonstrates that Knapp held a position with\nsubstantially different duties from her male colleagues” and\nthat “she never applied for a position similar to those they\nheld.” Id. at 859.

The court therefore dismissed Knapp’s second, sixth, and\neighth claims.\n   Knapp’s third claim was fashioned as a constructive dis-\ncharge claim under Title VII. The federal court rejected the\nclaim for two reasons. First, the court determined that Knapp\nhad not alleged facts sufficient for a jury to conclude that a\nreasonable person would have found the conditions of employ-\nment intolerable. The court noted that Ruser’s less frequent\ncommunication with Knapp, his personal slights against her,\nand his alleged disengagement from his own duties were not\nenough to create a cognizable constructive discharge claim.\nSecond, the court determined that although Knapp had aired\ncertain grievances with the dean, she did not give the law\nschool an opportunity to correct the problems before she\nresigned, and that her complaints were focused on long-term\nproblems in the clinic rather than her immediate problems with\nRuser. The court dismissed Knapp’s third claim.\n   For similar reasons, the court rejected Knapp’s tenth claim,\nwhich it characterized as an employment retaliation claim\nunder Title VII. The court determined that “a reasonable jury\ncould not conclude that Ruser’s alleged conduct constituted\nan adverse employment action.” Knapp, 145 F. Supp. 3d at\n861. The court stated that “Knapp acknowledge[d] that her\nstrained relationship with Ruser did not interfere with her abil-\nity to perform her duties” and that the evidence did not support\nher “assertion that Ruser’s alleged neglect of his own cases\nsomehow affected her duties.” Id. at 862.

The state district court sustained the defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment.\n   In its order ruling on the defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment, the district court began its analysis by noting that\nthree of the four remanded claims arose under Nebraska stat-\nutes that were patterned on analogous federal laws. The court\nstated that in Knapp’s fourth claim, she asserted a discrimina-\ntory wage practice claim under Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 48-1219\nthrough 48-1227.01 (Reissue 2010), which statutes the court\ncharacterized as the state equivalent of the federal EPA. The\ncourt stated that in her fifth and seventh claims, Knapp alleged\nviolations of the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice Act, Neb.\nRev. Stat. §§ 48-1101 through 48-1126 (Reissue 2010 & Cum.\nSupp. 2014) (NFEPA), which the court characterized as the\nstate equivalent of federal Title VII. The court noted that this\ncourt has held that Nebraska antidiscrimination laws are to be\ninterpreted in the same manner as their federal counterparts.\nThe court cited Nebraska appellate court cases looking to fed-\neral decisions construing Title VII for guidance to interpret the\nNFEPA. Extrapolating from the reasoning of those cases, the\ndistrict court concluded it should apply a similar approach and\nlooked to federal decisions construing the EPA for guidance\nregarding §§ 48-1219 through 48-1227.01.\n   The court first considered Knapp’s fourth claim, regard-\ning discriminatory wage practices, under §§ 48-1219 through\n48-1227.01. Using a rationale similar to that used by the\nfederal court when it rejected Knapp’s sixth claim, for wage\ndiscrimination under the EPA, the court rejected this claim.\nThe court indicated that the claim was specifically based on\n§ 48-1221(1). The court determined that Knapp had failed to\nshow any male employees who performed comparable work\nand that therefore, she could not establish a prima facie case\nof wage discrimination under § 48-1221(1). The court stated\nthat the male professor who was hired in March 2012 had\n\f                             - 649 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                  297 Nebraska R eports\n                        KNAPP v.

This task required\nhim to attend meetings with faculty and the dean and to per-\nform community outreach and academic research, as well\nas performing administrative tasks involved in establishing\nthe new clinic. The court determined that three other men to\nwhom Knapp compared herself were members of the college\nfaculty who had administrative and other duties that Knapp\ndid not have as a temporary member of the nontenured staff\nof the college. As a temporary lecturer, Knapp was assigned\nexclusively to teach students and did not have responsibilities\nto conduct academic research or perform community service.\nThe court also noted that Knapp had never applied for a posi-\ntion offering the possibility of tenure. The court granted sum-\nmary judgment in favor of the defendants on Knapp’s fourth\nclaim because she had not presented sufficient evidence of\ncomparable individuals to make a prima facie inference of\ndiscriminatory wages under § 48-1221(1).\n   The court next considered Knapp’s fifth claim, which it\ncharacterized as a claim of discrimination on the basis of\nsex under the NFEPA. The court determined that Knapp’s\ndiscrimination claim under the NFEPA failed for the same\nreason that her eighth claim, for discrimination under Title\nVII, had failed in the federal district court. The court noted\nthat the NFEPA mirrors Title VII and that in order to establish\na prima facie case for sex discrimination, a plaintiff needed\nto show, inter alia, that similarly situated males were treated\ndifferently.

Fifth Claim: Discrimination\n                         Under the NFEPA\n    Knapp’s fifth claim was based on the NFEPA. The district\ncourt analyzed Knapp’s fifth claim as a claim of discrimi-\nnation based on sex under the NFEPA; the court specifi-\ncally addressed Knapp’s arguments that it characterized as a\n­failure-to-hire claim. On appeal, Knapp makes two main argu-\n ments with regard to her fifth claim: (1) that the district court\n erred when it failed to analyze the fifth claim as a claim of\n improper classification under the NFEPA and (2) that the\n court erred when it determined that she had failed to show\n similarly situated male employees who were treated differ-\n ently. Knapp claims that because of these errors, the district\n court erred when it sustained the defendants’ motion for sum-\n mary judgment on her fifth claim and that the court abused\n its discretion when it overruled her motion to alter or amend\n the judgment in order to consider the fifth claim as a claim of\n improper classification.\n    [4] We note first that we have stated that the NFEPA is pat-\n terned after federal Title VII and that it is appropriate to look\n to federal court decisions construing Title VII for guidance\n\f                             - 654 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                  297 Nebraska R eports\n                        KNAPP v.

Like the\nplaintiff’s claim in Hartley, Knapp’s fifth claim is a claim of\ndisparate treatment, that is, “a claim based on an employer’s\ntreating some people less favorably than others because of\ntheir race, color, religion, sex, or other protected character-\nistics.” 294 Neb. at 891, 885 N.W.2d at 692-93. In Hartley,\nwe looked to federal case law applying Title VII, specifically\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., supra, to provide a framework\nfor a discrimination claim under the NFEPA. We noted in\nHartley that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. framework is not\nthe exclusive method of proving disparate treatment, but in\nthis case, as in Hartley, the district court used that frame-\nwork and the parties do not dispute that it was the appropri-\nate approach.\n   The first step under the McDonnell Douglas Corp. frame-\nwork is that “first the plaintiff has the burden of proving a\nprima facie case of discrimination.” Hartley, 294 Neb. at\n893, 885 N.W.2d at 693. In Hartley, the plaintiff set forth a\nfailure-to-promote claim, and therefore, we stated that a prima\nfacie case of discrimination in that case consisted of “demon-\nstrating (1) the employee is a member of a protected group,\n(2) the employee was qualified and applied for a promotion\nto an available position, (3) the employee was rejected, and\n(4) a similarly situated employee, not part of the protected\ngroup, was promoted instead.” 294 Neb. at 893, 885 N.W.2d\nat 693.\n   [5,6] We note, however, that courts typically modify the\nformulation of a prima facie case of employment discrimina-\ntion based on the specific type of discrimination claimed in a\nspecific case.

As a con-\nsequence of this determination, the court effectively deter-\nmined that Knapp had failed to show similarly situated male\nemployees who were classified differently than she was and\nthat therefore, she failed to show a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination resulting from an improper classification under\n§ 48-1104(2).\n                      (b) Similarly Situated\n   Knapp further argues that the court erred when it determined\nwith respect to her fifth claim that she failed to show simi-\nlarly situated male employees who were treated differently.\nAs noted above, this finding was dispositive of the improper\nclassification aspects of Knapp’s claim as well as the other\naspects of the claim. Knapp argues that she presented evidence\nof similarly situated males because she presented evidence that\nmale employees were moved from nontenure positions into\ntenure track positions with higher pay.\n   The district court determined that Knapp failed to show\nsimilarly situated males because the males to whom she com-\npared herself had duties that were different from or in addition\nto the duties that she performed. Because Knapp did not show\nthe existence of males who were similarly situated, she could\nnot show that males were treated differently. Any differences\nin compensation or classification could be explained by the\ndifferences in duties.\n   Knapp argues that the men were treated differently because\nthey moved on to tenure track positions. But when the men\nmoved on to such positions, they took on additional duties\nand therefore were no longer similarly situated. Therefore,\nto the extent that Knapp compares herself to male employees\nwho moved on to tenure track positions while she did not, her\nargument is no longer that she was treated differently from\nsimilarly situated male employees.

Therefore, when bringing a claim of wage discrimina-\ntion based on sex under § 48-1221(1), a plaintiff must first\nestablish a prima facie case by showing by a preponderance\nof the evidence that (1) the plaintiff was paid less than a per-\nson of the opposite sex employed in the same establishment;\n(2) for equal work on jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and\nresponsibility; (3) which were performed under similar work-\ning conditions.
