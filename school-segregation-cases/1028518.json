The school defendants' motion, filed April 28, 1978, was accompanied by a form of proposed consent decree. However, in briefs and at the hearing on May 30, 1978, plaintiffs and other parties withheld their consent, objected to termination generally and to various specific provisions. Hence the need for particularized orders. For the most part they adopt the provisions of the proposed consent decree. The principal changes made by the court are in the scope of the provisions affecting the administrative staff and the assignment of monitoring functions to the Department of Implementation.</p>\n<p>Termination at this time is the result of a course of proceedings and investigations advised by the Court of Appeals in its opinion dated January 26, 1977, in <i>Morgan v. McDonough,</i> 1 Cir. 1977, 548 F.2d 28, 33. At a hearing on the day after issuance of the opinion of the Court of Appeals, the court ordered that various reports and proposals be filed by February 11, 1977 and scheduled a hearing for February 17. In order that more complete information might be obtained the parties requested postponement of the hearing, which was continued until April 21, 1977. At that time and thereafter the court heard the arguments <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1115</span> and positions of the parties and ruled against termination during 1977. Throughout the 1977-78 school year conditions at the high school improved dramatically, as reflected in periodic reports received from the temporary receiver and the court-appointed experts and in stories in the news media. For example, a report by the experts, Deans Dentler and Scott of the Boston University School of Education, on their visit to the school on March 3, 1978 stated,</p>\n<blockquote>On our visit, the plant was absolutely transformed. It has been improved tenfold since 1976. It is clean, repaired, new equipment has been added, and it actually looks like a place anyone would be willing to attend. The programmatic and interpersonal environments are even more extraordinarily transformed than is the plant. No one shuffles about anymore. An atmosphere of dignity and participation prevails.</blockquote>\n<p>To see for itself, the court visited the school for two and a half hours on May 18, 1978. By the end of the 1977-78 school year it became apparent that the conditions warranting the extraordinary receivership remedy no longer existed.<sup>[1]</sup> Plaintiffs' filing on May 19, 1978, in response to the school defendants' motion for termination, listed at pp. 3-4 twenty problems in and outside the school which, in their opinion, supported the imposition of receivership in December 1975. Almost without exception, these problems have disappeared.</p>\n<p>Developments within the school committee and school department also support the court's order of termination. Foremost is their commitment to desegregation at South Boston High School and to preservation of the changes made pursuant to the court's orders entered December 9, 1975 and subsequently, and ratified in the proposed consent decree accompanying their motion for termination. Additional evidence of the school defendants' good faith and cooperation is found in their votes on August 25, 1978 appointing administrators nominated by the receiver. The court is relying too on the affirmative action program adopted by the current school committee shortly after it took office at the beginning of this year. Another important development has been the recent reorganization of the school department enacted by the state legislature, Mass.Stats.1978, c. 333. Henceforth the business manager, chief plant engineer and chief structural engineer will be under the control of the Superintendent, who will be accountable for the physical condition of the school. Finally, the Department of Implementation has come into its own and has demonstrated, especially in the matter of student assignments for the 1978-79 academic year, its readiness and capacity to facilitate and monitor implementation of the court's desegregation plan. These favorable developments underlie the court's confidence that the fruits of the temporary receivership at South Boston High School will be preserved without continuing court intervention.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff class and State Board of Education objected to termination unless gradual and urged a trial period during which the court and parties might evaluate the actions of the school defendants in carrying out the provisions of the proposed consent decree. In our opinion the school defendants, by their conduct outlined in the previous paragraph, have shown that a longer trial period than one commencing with their filing on April 28, 1978 is unwarranted. Their motion for termination represented that they \"are now carrying out the proposed consent decree which is designed to give effect to the Court's Desegregation Orders in a meaningful manner at South Boston High School\" and they have been carrying out the proposed decree pending the court's ruling on their motion. For example, in addition to the accomplishments previously referred to, the school defendants have already exceeded the goals for faculty and staff desegregation set <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1116</span> forth in paragraph 19 of the orders and have completed nearly all of the repairs specified in paragraph 43.</p>\n<p>The Boston Teachers Union, which has been heard as an intervenor throughout the remedial phase of these proceedings, endorsed the termination of the receivership, which it opposed from its inception, but filed objections to several specific provisions of the proposed consent decree, herein adopted, which conflict with collective bargaining agreements defining the rights and benefits of teachers and administrators. For examples, paragraph 6 permits the headmaster to select instructional aides, whereas the bargaining agreement provides for recall by seniority; paragraph 10 prescribes certain in-service meetings to be led by the headmaster, whereas the agreement says that they shall be conducted by the teaching staff; paragraph 15, which permits the headmaster to select new faculty members until August 31, 1980, conflicts with teachers' transfer rights; and paragraph 33 creates the new position of coordinator of the work-experience program without the job description, compensation and qualifications having been negotiated with the union and posted for transfer or promotion. Generally the Union has objected to what it calls the school's \"protective custody for two years described in the proposed Consent Decree\". The court overrules these objections and, in converting proposed consent decree provisions into court orders, has prefaced several sentences with the phrase, \"Notwithstanding inconsistent collective bargaining agreement provisions,\". Similarly, paragraph 7 of the orders which follow ratifies school defendants' appointments and transfers of faculty and staff made pursuant to formal orders of the court, e. g., those entered April 7, June 4, August 20 and September 27, 1976 and those made without formal orders, e. g., the appointments on August 25, 1978, by direction of the receiver with court approval.</p>\n<p>In support of its overruling the Union's objections, the court finds that the incompatibility of certain of its orders which follow with collective bargaining agreements is necessary to hold the gains in peaceful desegregation made at South Boston High School since December 1975 and to maintain the conditions at the high school which have enabled the court to terminate the receivership. Where unnecessary, e. g., paragraph 14 of the proposed consent decree which provided for further staff transfers by the headmaster, the court has sustained the Union's objection and deleted the provision. These rulings are special desegregation measures, akin to those ordered in section 9 of the omnibus orders entered on May 3, 1976, section 11 of those on May 6, 1977 and section 8 of those on March 21, 1978. Moreover, they will govern for but two more years. Throughout these proceedings the court has taken pains to avoid orders which would conflict with applicable union contracts. We can think of only one instance other than in connection with the special problems at South Boston High School, viz., emergency staffing of the Department of Implementation, when collective bargaining agreements were not observed. The understanding and cooperation of teachers and administrators have been the linchpins of the student desegregation plan, holding fast in sometimes stormy weather. The court will remain mindful of the rights of faculty and staff and their union representatives.</p>\n<p>The return of South Boston High School to normal channels of administration, herein ordered, is due to the perseverance and sacrifice of many persons. It is not a purpose of this memorandum of decision to identify them all, even as members of groups. However, any discussion of the receivership's termination must acknowledge the strength of character of the students who attended the school and the parents who sent them. Their courage and faith were indispensable. Also, without elaborating the details of their contributions, there are a handful of individuals whose lives were caught up in the effort to create a learning environment at a desegregated South Boston High School: Jerome C. Winegar, the headmaster who was recruited from St. Paul, Minnesota; Geraldine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1117</span> Kozberg, who came with him from St. Paul to direct program development; James B. Corscadden, acting headmaster until Winegar's appointment and thereafter assistant headmaster; Marion J. Fahey, temporary receiver at the court's request, in addition to being superintendent of schools; Joseph M. McDonough, community district superintendent; Martin A. Walsh, regional director of the Community Relations Service of the U.S. Department of Justice; and Edward F. McHugh, Jr., Esquire, counsel for the temporary receiver. The court and parties will always be indebted to them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ORDERS</h2>\n<p>1) The temporary receivership of South Boston High School is terminated as of August 31, 1978 on the terms and conditions herein stated.</p>\n<p>2) Except for the parts deleted (first two unnumbered paragraphs and paragraphs 1-4, 14, 19 and 43), the provisions of the proposed consent decree filed on April 28, 1978 with the school defendants' motion for termination of South Boston High School receivership are adopted as orders of this court as herein modified.</p>\n<p>3) Consent decree paragraphs 1-4, 14,<sup>[2]</sup> 19 and 43 are deleted.

Throughout the 1977-78 school year conditions at the high school improved dramatically, as reflected in periodic reports received from the temporary receiver and the court-appointed experts and in stories in the news media. For example, a report by the experts, Deans Dentler and Scott of the Boston University School of Education, on their visit to the school on March 3, 1978 stated,</p>\n<blockquote>On our visit, the plant was absolutely transformed. It has been improved tenfold since 1976. It is clean, repaired, new equipment has been added, and it actually looks like a place anyone would be willing to attend. The programmatic and interpersonal environments are even more extraordinarily transformed than is the plant. No one shuffles about anymore. An atmosphere of dignity and participation prevails.</blockquote>\n<p>To see for itself, the court visited the school for two and a half hours on May 18, 1978. By the end of the 1977-78 school year it became apparent that the conditions warranting the extraordinary receivership remedy no longer existed.<sup>[1]</sup> Plaintiffs' filing on May 19, 1978, in response to the school defendants' motion for termination, listed at pp. 3-4 twenty problems in and outside the school which, in their opinion, supported the imposition of receivership in December 1975. Almost without exception, these problems have disappeared.</p>\n<p>Developments within the school committee and school department also support the court's order of termination. Foremost is their commitment to desegregation at South Boston High School and to preservation of the changes made pursuant to the court's orders entered December 9, 1975 and subsequently, and ratified in the proposed consent decree accompanying their motion for termination. Additional evidence of the school defendants' good faith and cooperation is found in their votes on August 25, 1978 appointing administrators nominated by the receiver. The court is relying too on the affirmative action program adopted by the current school committee shortly after it took office at the beginning of this year. Another important development has been the recent reorganization of the school department enacted by the state legislature, Mass.Stats.1978, c. 333. Henceforth the business manager, chief plant engineer and chief structural engineer will be under the control of the Superintendent, who will be accountable for the physical condition of the school. Finally, the Department of Implementation has come into its own and has demonstrated, especially in the matter of student assignments for the 1978-79 academic year, its readiness and capacity to facilitate and monitor implementation of the court's desegregation plan. These favorable developments underlie the court's confidence that the fruits of the temporary receivership at South Boston High School will be preserved without continuing court intervention.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff class and State Board of Education objected to termination unless gradual and urged a trial period during which the court and parties might evaluate the actions of the school defendants in carrying out the provisions of the proposed consent decree. In our opinion the school defendants, by their conduct outlined in the previous paragraph, have shown that a longer trial period than one commencing with their filing on April 28, 1978 is unwarranted. Their motion for termination represented that they \"are now carrying out the proposed consent decree which is designed to give effect to the Court's Desegregation Orders in a meaningful manner at South Boston High School\" and they have been carrying out the proposed decree pending the court's ruling on their motion. For example, in addition to the accomplishments previously referred to, the school defendants have already exceeded the goals for faculty and staff desegregation set <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1116</span> forth in paragraph 19 of the orders and have completed nearly all of the repairs specified in paragraph 43.</p>\n<p>The Boston Teachers Union, which has been heard as an intervenor throughout the remedial phase of these proceedings, endorsed the termination of the receivership, which it opposed from its inception, but filed objections to several specific provisions of the proposed consent decree, herein adopted, which conflict with collective bargaining agreements defining the rights and benefits of teachers and administrators. For examples, paragraph 6 permits the headmaster to select instructional aides, whereas the bargaining agreement provides for recall by seniority; paragraph 10 prescribes certain in-service meetings to be led by the headmaster, whereas the agreement says that they shall be conducted by the teaching staff; paragraph 15, which permits the headmaster to select new faculty members until August 31, 1980, conflicts with teachers' transfer rights; and paragraph 33 creates the new position of coordinator of the work-experience program without the job description, compensation and qualifications having been negotiated with the union and posted for transfer or promotion. Generally the Union has objected to what it calls the school's \"protective custody for two years described in the proposed Consent Decree\". The court overrules these objections and, in converting proposed consent decree provisions into court orders, has prefaced several sentences with the phrase, \"Notwithstanding inconsistent collective bargaining agreement provisions,\". Similarly, paragraph 7 of the orders which follow ratifies school defendants' appointments and transfers of faculty and staff made pursuant to formal orders of the court, e. g., those entered April 7, June 4, August 20 and September 27, 1976 and those made without formal orders, e. g., the appointments on August 25, 1978, by direction of the receiver with court approval.</p>\n<p>In support of its overruling the Union's objections, the court finds that the incompatibility of certain of its orders which follow with collective bargaining agreements is necessary to hold the gains in peaceful desegregation made at South Boston High School since December 1975 and to maintain the conditions at the high school which have enabled the court to terminate the receivership. Where unnecessary, e. g., paragraph 14 of the proposed consent decree which provided for further staff transfers by the headmaster, the court has sustained the Union's objection and deleted the provision. These rulings are special desegregation measures, akin to those ordered in section 9 of the omnibus orders entered on May 3, 1976, section 11 of those on May 6, 1977 and section 8 of those on March 21, 1978. Moreover, they will govern for but two more years. Throughout these proceedings the court has taken pains to avoid orders which would conflict with applicable union contracts. We can think of only one instance other than in connection with the special problems at South Boston High School, viz., emergency staffing of the Department of Implementation, when collective bargaining agreements were not observed. The understanding and cooperation of teachers and administrators have been the linchpins of the student desegregation plan, holding fast in sometimes stormy weather. The court will remain mindful of the rights of faculty and staff and their union representatives.</p>\n<p>The return of South Boston High School to normal channels of administration, herein ordered, is due to the perseverance and sacrifice of many persons. It is not a purpose of this memorandum of decision to identify them all, even as members of groups. However, any discussion of the receivership's termination must acknowledge the strength of character of the students who attended the school and the parents who sent them. Their courage and faith were indispensable. Also, without elaborating the details of their contributions, there are a handful of individuals whose lives were caught up in the effort to create a learning environment at a desegregated South Boston High School: Jerome C. Winegar, the headmaster who was recruited from St. Paul, Minnesota; Geraldine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1117</span> Kozberg, who came with him from St. Paul to direct program development; James B. Corscadden, acting headmaster until Winegar's appointment and thereafter assistant headmaster; Marion J. Fahey, temporary receiver at the court's request, in addition to being superintendent of schools; Joseph M. McDonough, community district superintendent; Martin A. Walsh, regional director of the Community Relations Service of the U.S. Department of Justice; and Edward F. McHugh, Jr., Esquire, counsel for the temporary receiver. The court and parties will always be indebted to them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ORDERS</h2>\n<p>1) The temporary receivership of South Boston High School is terminated as of August 31, 1978 on the terms and conditions herein stated.</p>\n<p>2) Except for the parts deleted (first two unnumbered paragraphs and paragraphs 1-4, 14, 19 and 43), the provisions of the proposed consent decree filed on April 28, 1978 with the school defendants' motion for termination of South Boston High School receivership are adopted as orders of this court as herein modified.</p>\n<p>3) Consent decree paragraphs 1-4, 14,<sup>[2]</sup> 19 and 43 are deleted.
