If such an\ninmate meets the criteria enumerated in Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e), he\nor she will be resentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines such\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.1 (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (f); People v. Yearwood (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 168.)\n       After the Act went into effect, Curtis James Owens (defendant), an inmate serving\na term of 25 years to life in prison following conviction of felonies that were not violent\n(as defined by § 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by § 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a\npetition for resentencing under the Act. The trial court found defendant represented an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety and denied the petition.\n       We hold (1) the People met their burden of proving, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, facts on which a finding that resentencing defendant would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety reasonably could be based; (2) the trial\ncourt’s finding defendant posed a risk to the community was sufficient, under the\ncircumstances, to establish an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, and the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in so finding; (3) the trial court’s finding of\ndangerousness did not violate defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury;\n(4) the trial court did not erroneously apply collateral estoppel to contested rules\nviolations; (5) any error in the trial court’s refusal of defense evidence was harmless;\n(6) defendant has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel; (7) defendant had\nno right to a continuance to allow him the opportunity to prove himself; and (8) recently\nenacted section 1170.18, subdivision (c) does not modify section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n                                               2.\n\f                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       On November 5, 1999, defendant was convicted of attempted second degree\nburglary (§§ 459, 664; count one) and second degree burglary (§ 459; count two). He\nwas sentenced to concurrent terms of 25 years to life in prison pursuant to sections 667,\nsubdivisions (b) through (i) and 1170.12.\n       On November 15, 2012, defendant petitioned for resentencing under\nsection 1170.126. The trial court made a preliminary finding defendant was eligible for\nresentencing, appointed counsel, and provisionally set the matter for hearing.2 Several\ncontinuances were granted, in part so the parties could obtain and review pertinent court\nand prison records.\n       The People ultimately opposed the petition, asserting resentencing defendant\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. They pointed to defendant’s\nlengthy, increasingly violent record, and set out a number of his offenses. In 1979, as a\njuvenile, defendant robbed a liquor store clerk at gun point. As an adult, defendant was\nconvicted of five counts of robbery with use of a firearm for robberies committed during\n1983 and 1984. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. In 1987, approximately two\nmonths after he was released on parole, he committed another armed robbery. He was\nconvicted of several offenses arising out of that incident and sentenced to 11 years in\nprison. He violated parole in 1995, was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of\ndomestic violence in 1998, and perpetrated the commitment offenses — vehicle burglary\nand attempted vehicle burglary — on August 12, 1999, while he was on probation for the\ndomestic violence offenses.\n       The People also related defendant’s prison classification score was 128, well\nabove the minimum score of 19 for a life offender. They noted his “extensive”\n\n2     Although we refer to the trial court, the judge who originally sentenced defendant\nwas no longer on the bench at the time the resentencing petition was filed. Accordingly,\nanother judge was assigned to rule on the petition. (See § 1170.126, subd. (j).)\n\n\n                                             3.\n\fdisciplinary write-ups and periods of housing in administrative segregation, and\npresented summaries of a number of California Department of Corrections and\nRehabilitation (CDCR) 115 rule violation reports (“115’s”) and disciplinary chronos\n(“128’s”), together with reasons defendant was placed in administrative segregation or\nthe security housing unit (SHU).3 The 115’s for which defendant was found guilty\nincluded, but were not limited to:\n     Participation in a riot (Jan. 11, 2012): Full riot, with defendant identified as a\nparticipant.4\n     Destruction of state property (Dec. 15, 2010): Defendant destroyed a sheet and\nwhen spoken to, said, “‘FUCK YOU, GET YOUR PUNK ASS AWAY FROM MY\nDOOR.’”\n     Fighting (June 22, 2010): Defendant was swinging both fists toward another\ninmate.\n     Possession of inmate weapon (Jan. 12, 2009): A fight between defendant and\nanother inmate was observed. The inmates were ordered to the ground, but failed to\ncomply and were pepper sprayed. The inmates separated, and defendant was ordered to\nshow his hands. He refused, and flung an object toward the stairwell. A piece of hard\nplastic, four and one-half inches long and one inch wide, sharpened to a point with the\nother end wrapped in cloth as a handle, was recovered.\n     Battery on a peace officer (Oct. 17, 2006): An officer delivering milk to\ndefendant’s cell asked defendant to turn on a bright light. Defendant appeared agitated.\n\n3       “A ‘CDC 115’ violation is one that is ‘believed to be a violation of law or [that] is\nnot minor in nature,’ and a ‘128 disciplinary chrono’ is minor misconduct that recurs\nafter verbal counseling. [Citation.]” (In re Gomez (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1299,\nfn. 3; see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, § 3312, subd. (a)(2), (3).)\n4      The People’s recitation of defendant’s housing history showed defendant was\ncontinued in the administrative segregation unit on several occasions following the riot\ndue to his promoting continued violence between Southern Hispanics and Black gangs.\n\n\n                                              4.\n\fAs the milk was placed on the security port door, defendant swatted at it and the cartons\nflew into the officer’s leg.\n    Indecent exposure (Sept. 18, 2005): During count, defendant was observed to\nhave his shorts pulled down while he was masturbating. He made no effort to stop or\ncover himself when the light shined into his cell.\n    Disrespect to staff (Dec. 10, 2004): Defendant was asked why he was in a\nparticular area and for identification. He claimed not to have his identification card. A\nsearch of his person revealed the card. Asked why he lied, he responded, “‘FUCK YOU\nPUNK’” and called the correctional officer names.\n    Theft (Apr. 2, 2004): While the clerk at receiving and release was distracted with\nanother inmate, defendant took a television and Walkman and put them in a box. The\ntelevision later was recovered from his cell and the Walkman was found elsewhere.\n       The People acknowledged defendant had “very modest” work and vocational\nhistory, but pointed out he had not taken advantage of any substance-related\nprogramming, anger management, or any program that might assist him in gaining insight\ninto antisocial behaviors. They asserted defendant had no documented self-help\nprogramming other than a brief period of participation in the Lifer Group, and argued he\ncontinued to exhibit poor impulse control and behaviors exhibiting violence and defiance,\nwhile doing little or nothing to address the factors involved in his criminality.\n       Defendant submitted a sworn declaration, in which he conceded he had a number\nof 115’s and 128’s, but claimed only some were true, most were not, and others had\nmitigating circumstances. Defendant gave the following explanations for some of them:\n    Participation in a riot (115 rule violation dated Jan. 11, 2012): Defendant was on\nthe prison yard when, without warning, about 150 Black and Hispanic inmates began to\nbrawl. Defendant backed against a wall and deflected attempts to assault him, but did not\nfight. He claimed medical records concerning treatment provided to participants would\nshow he was one of the few without injury. Nevertheless, on February 8, 2012, he was\n\n                                              5.\n\frandomly selected, along with 20 others, for a four-month stint in SHU for his alleged\nparticipation.\n    Destruction of state property (115 rule violation dated Dec. 12, 2010): Defendant\nwas assigned to a new cell, in which the current occupant had hung a sheet for privacy.\n“Somehow,” defendant was blamed. Although the sheet was undamaged, he was charged\n$15 out of his commissary money.\n    Fighting (115 rule violations dated June 2, 2010, and June 22, 2010): While in\nchurch, defendant was “sucker-punched” by another inmate. The assault cut defendant\nabove his right eye, and he grabbed the other inmate to smother the attack, but threw no\npunches. They fell to the floor and guards interceded. The prison hearing officer ruled it\na mutual combat, although defendant disagreed. On the second date, the same inmate\nagain attempted to assault defendant.\n    Delaying a prison official (115 rule violation dated Sept. 23, 2009): Defendant\nrefused to have a certain individual as his cellmate, because the inmate was well known\nto defendant to be a dangerous man.\n    Possession of a weapon (115 rule violation dated Jan. 12, 2009): Defendant was\nfound with a sharpened toothbrush. He admitted possessing it, but explained he did so\nfor protection, having been threatened earlier with a stabbing by another inmate.\nDefendant related he had been “‘shanked’” several times over the years while in prison,\nwith the attack on one occasion nearly puncturing his lung.\n    Disrespecting others/staff (115 rule violations dated Aug. 15, 2008, Dec. 18, 2004,\n& Feb. 5, 2004): Defendant considered the correctional officers at High Desert State\nPrison, where he was held in 2008, “particularly racist.” One of the female guards\ninterfered with his mail and he called her a “‘white bitch,’” which he realized he should\nnot have done. Twice in 2004, he used “the ‘F’ word” on disrespectful Folsom staff.\n    Failure to attend school (128 disciplinary chronos dated July 31, 2008, Apr. 28,\n2004, & Jan. 1, 2004): Defendant initially consented to go to classes, but soon learned\n\n                                            6.\n\fthe instruction was at elementary school level. Defendant was a high school graduate and\nwanted to attend college preparation or adult school, but such courses were not offered.\n    Battery on a prison official (115 rule violation dated Oct. 17, 2006): A\ncorrectional officer slid two milk cartons on a tray through the food slot in defendant’s\ncell. Defendant, who had just awakened and was still groggy, clumsily reached for them\nand accidentally knocked both out of the hole. He was told one struck the guard on the\nleg.\n    Stealing/unauthorized acquisition (115 rule violations dated Jan. 25, 2006, &\nApr. 2, 2004): In 2006, defendant purchased food for his cellmate, using the cellmate’s\nidentification with his consent. This was against prison rules. In 2004, defendant went to\nthe receiving and release office to pick up several boxes of his own property. The\nattendant waved his hand at a pile and said they were defendant’s and defendant could\ntake them. When defendant got back to his cell, he opened a box and realized it was\nsomeone else’s property. He was telling another inmate to notify a guard when a guard\nappeared and accused defendant of theft.\n    Indecent exposure (115 rule violation dated Sept. 18, 2005): Defendant was lying\nin bed, masturbating, around 3:00 a.m., when he realized a female guard was shining a\nflashlight on him. He denied purposely exposing himself to her or attempting to prolong\nthe encounter.\n    Grooming (128 disciplinary chronos dated Sept. 28, 2004, & Jan. 1, 2004): On\none occasion, defendant did not shave for a few days. On the other, he purposely began\nto grow a goatee. Both were in violation of Folsom’s appearance regulations. Defendant\nshaved when faced with loss of yard privileges.\n       In his declaration, defendant stated he was currently 50 years old. He denied\ninitiating any fights while in prison or being affiliated with any prison gang. He admitted\ndefending himself on occasion, but never to a greater extent than necessary. He related\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\fthat he had family who would help with his transition into the community, he would stay\nwith his brother, and his brother had lined up work for him.\n       The petition was heard on April 19, 2013. The court stated it had read the\nPeople’s opposition and defendant’s declaration, and reviewed defendant’s file. It found\n“things of concern” in defendant’s custodial behavior. Although defendant had addressed\nsome of them, the court permitted defense counsel to “amplify” the explanations\ncontained in defendant’s declaration.\n       Turning first to the rule violation for participation in a riot, defense counsel stated\nthere were many documents related to the incident that contained various correctional\nofficers’ observations of participants, and defendant was not mentioned until the riot was\nover. Counsel noted defendant had no injuries, which, he argued, gave credence to\ndefendant’s claim he backed into the safest area he could and deflected all assaults on\nhim. The prosecutor responded that in order to be “convict[ed]” of a 115, participation,\nnot mere presence, was required. He represented evidence of defendant’s participation\nwas found.5 The prosecutor conceded there was no evidence defendant instigated or was\na “main player” in the incident, but he asserted defendant was a participant, and that was\n“what was sustained in a guilty finding.” Defense counsel responded that according to\ndefendant, he was accused of participating at the hearing, he denied it, and a guilty\nfinding was made.\n       The court stated that, in looking at the “hierarchy” of conduct, it differentiated\nbetween “affirmative assaultive behavior” — particularly on correctional staff — and\n“defensive assaultive behavior.” It found no affirmative assaultive behavior on\ncorrectional staff in defendant’s background, but inquired about defendant’s possession\nof a sharpened toothbrush. The prosecutor agreed the weapon was not used, but argued\n\n\n5     Although it was this prosecutor’s practice to summarize, rather than submit, the\nunderlying prison documents, he had them available for the court’s review.\n\n\n                                              8.\n\fthat by defendant’s own statement, it was being held for use, and even keeping it in a\ndefensive manner suggested a willingness to apply deadly force. Defendant responded\nthat he was holding the toothbrush for protection against the same inmate who had\nassaulted him. As for the fighting in 2010, the prosecutor asserted defendant was a full\nparticipant in the fight and appeared to be the aggressor. Defense counsel related that\nwhen defendant denied starting the fight, the hearing officer deemed it mutual combat.\nThe prosecutor pointed out the finding was “fighting,” not “mutual combat,” and that\nwhile the prosecutor did not know whether defendant’s assertion he was sucker punched\nwas true, defendant was observed beating the other inmate.\n       The court next turned to the November 2006 finding of battery on a peace officer,\nwhich was based on the milk carton incident. It noted it did not appear a weapon was\nused or the officer injured. The prosecutor agreed with that assessment, but argued the\nconcern was defendant’s attitude, which he exhibited during that period of his\nincarceration, and his defiant conduct. The prosecutor also suggested defendant was\n“engaging in a little revision of the history.”\n       The court stated it did not appreciate defendant’s conduct, but, it acknowledged,\n“the prison atmosphere is a much different atmosphere. The behavior that occurs in\nprison appearing in a significantly different societal structure than out in public.” The\ncourt also acknowledged the prosecutor’s position, which was that there were rules in\nprison, and prisoners should follow those rules. The prosecutor argued there could be no\ndoubt from the record that defendant had “an attitude problem,” and there was no\nsuggestion defendant had changed or would no longer engage in “defiant and difficult\nconduct” if released from prison.\n       Defense counsel responded that defendant had not incurred any 115’s since\nJanuary 2012, thus indicating defendant’s behavior had indeed improved. He noted\ndefendant’s brother was present to discuss “outpatient” plans. Defendant’s older brother,\nMelvin Collins, represented to the court that he had a stable home, and defendant would\n\n                                              9.\n\fbe able to stay with him. Collins suggested they could work together at truck driving and\nthat there were “[l]ots of things in the fire,” but the outcome of the resentencing hearing\nhad to be known first.\n       Defense counsel stated he was very familiar with actuarial research, and at\ndefendant’s age, it was “highly unlikely,” unless there was “some severe pathology,” that\na person would continue to engage in robbery or “gross assaults” or similar offenses.\nDefense counsel noted the court was probably aware of that fact, but offered to provide\nthe court with articles and other materials if the court was interested. The court declined,\nbut confirmed defendant was born in 1962 and was 50 years old at the time of the\nhearing. The prosecutor stated he was also familiar with the data concerning age, and\nthat he had no objection to the court getting a risk assessment, but he cautioned against\ngeneralizing. He pointed out that defendant’s criminal history dated back to when he was\na juvenile, he failed probation and parole, and he persisted in his behaviors throughout his\nincarceration. The prosecutor argued defendant’s disciplinary violations were “very\nserious 115s in the context of a criminal history that is abysmal,” and he urged the court\nto consider “a collective review of [defendant’s] entire history, as well as his attitude and\ndemeanor.”\n       The court decided it wanted a risk assessment factoring in age. It declined to give\na tentative ruling, but referred the matter to the probation department to obtain an\nindependent determination. The court stated:\n\n       “This is — I don’t want to mislead [defendant]. This is a close call. [The\n       prosecutor] makes a very valid point. On the other hand, what is significant\n       to the Court is [the prosecutor’s] points are factually accurate. It is\n       significant to the Court, … that while I’m not excusing [defendant’s]\n       conduct at all — for instance, the possession of the inmate manufactured\n       weapon that [the prosecutor] notes to appear to be for defense purposes,\n       there is nothing in the record. [Prosecutor], I understand your point, a\n       weapon is a weapon, and its presence in the institution creates a danger, per\n       se; however, does not appear that there is any indication that [defendant]\n       was possessing it to affirmatively attack given the previous attacks against\n\n\n                                             10.\n\f       him, and the way in which it apparently was possessed. It appears to be a\n       defense weapon, as does [defendant’s] conduct.\n\n               “So — I don’t — I understand [the prosecutor’s] argument. If I\n       agree to everything [the prosecutor] was saying, I deny it today. So that is\n       why I am referring it over, because I think there is another side to this that\n       creates a legitimate finding that [defendant], while perhaps not exemplar in\n       the institution, would not create such a danger to the community under\n       [section] 1170.126, that he should not be resentenced. I will … ask\n       specifically for a risk assessment factoring in age.”\n       The court appointed Dr. Terrell to conduct the risk assessment, and continued the\nmatter to a specific date for receipt of the report and the court’s decision. The court told\ndefendant: “I will decide it that day. If there is too much there, and you are not\nappropriate for resentencing, I won’t resentence you. I don’t know if it helps you or not,\nbut we will make that decision that day. I will not continue it out after that. It is set over\nto that date. [¶] … It is a close call. But I wouldn’t refer you to probation if I didn’t\nthink there was a legitimate reason to resentence you. I haven’t made a decision.”\n       The probation officer filed a report that related defendant said he had attended\nnumerous religious classes since 2000, and completed a six month “Lifers” group course\nin 2008 and a 90-day behavioral management course, designed to deal with anger and\nstress issues, in October 2012. The probation officer also noted prison documentation\nshowing defendant received two certificates of accomplishment in August 2010 for\nkeyboarding, as well as a certificate of achievement for completing a course on office\nservices and related technologies. Defendant told the probation officer he had changed\nhis life from what he used to be, and was ready to be a productive citizen. Based on a\nreview of defendant’s prior criminal history and disciplinary history while incarcerated,\nhowever, the probation officer observed: “While [defendant] states that he has changed,\nhis documented performance reveals otherwise. This officer notes that prison life\nrequires adjustments and is a stressful environment; however, it appears that the\ndefendant has not taken advantage of opportunities to make positive changes.”\n\n\n\n                                             11.\n\fAccordingly, the probation officer recommended the court find defendant to be an\nunreasonable risk to public safety and that resentencing be denied.\n       Terrell submitted a report in which, in part, he related that the primary reason for\ndefendant’s longstanding criminal history was most likely defendant’s antisocial\npersonality disorder. Terrell also noted, however, that people with antisocial personality\ndisorder often show a decrease in their criminal behavior as they enter the fourth decade\nof life. Terrell stated it appeared defendant had been in slightly less trouble over the\npreceding five years or so; however, Terrell pronounced himself “gravely concerned” by\ndefendant being in possession of a prison-made weapon in 2009, his reported\nparticipation in a prison riot, and his reported efforts to encourage more violence and\nretaliation at the prison after the 2012 riot. Terrell opined that defendant represented a\nmoderate to high risk of violence to the community if released. He stated he would feel\nmore optimistic about defendant’s prognosis if and when defendant could maintain a\nperiod of at least four to five years without any antisocial, violent, or assaultive behavior.\nTerrell recommended denial of release at the present time.\n       The continued hearing was held on May 24, 2013. The court stated it had read and\nconsidered the probation officer’s and Terrell’s reports. Defense counsel stated that he\nspoke to Terrell after receiving the report, and Terrell related that he accepted virtually\neverything from the CDCR records “as gospel.” When defense counsel mentioned\nactuarials indicating a 50-year-old man was not going to be recidivating, particularly in a\nviolent fashion, as a 25- or 30-year-old would, Terrell said he was unfamiliar with them.\nDefense counsel then sent Terrell several hundred pages of studies and other information\non that point, because Terrell said he might be willing to reconsider.\n       Defense counsel argued that defendant had no actual violence until about 2009,\nwhen he was attacked and armed himself in self-defense. As for the riot, defendant had\nno notice beforehand that it was going to occur, and he had very passive participation.\nDefense counsel related that, according to defendant, out of the 300 inmates involved, 10\n\n                                             12.\n\fHispanics and 10 Blacks, of whom the guards were not very fond, were selected and\nplaced in SHU. Most recently, defendant had had 17 months of “spotless” behavior.\n       With respect to Terrell’s diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, defense\ncounsel pointed out Terrell noted, as did the actuarial information, that the disorder began\nto remit after the fourth decade of life, and defendant was about to enter his sixth decade.\nAccordingly, counsel asserted, there was no indication defendant would continue to\nbehave in an antisocial fashion. Defense counsel noted defendant had never hurt anyone.\nHe also represented that, because defendant had had an addiction to methamphetamine at\none point, defendant was willing to do an inpatient program to make sure it did not recur;\ndefendant was originally a truck driver and had the potential for employment through his\nbrother; and defendant was willing to continue an anger management program. Defense\ncounsel asked the court to accept defendant’s declarations and consider some form of\nsupervision for him, or, alternatively, to permit counsel to provide the actuarial\ndocuments to Terrell, the court, and the prosecutor, and to cross-examine Terrell on that\npoint. The final alternative defense counsel suggested was for the court to encourage\ndefendant to continue his violation-free behavior by returning defendant to prison for six\nmonths to a year, retaining jurisdiction, and, if defendant could “follow the Court’s view\nof probation in a sense, then … give him the benefit of the doubt and … consider\nreleasing him.”\n       The prosecutor objected to defense counsel testifying and submitting additional\ninformation, although he had no problem with counsel augmenting the record by bringing\nin someone if the court was willing to have that person testify. The prosecutor noted that\na risk assessment was “a broad-spectrum analysis of an individual and their propensity\nfor violence or recidivism,” which was the type of examination Terrell submitted. The\nprosecutor was against some level of supervision for defendant, because he did not\nbelieve someone who had a moderate to high risk of violence should be released in the\nfirst instance. As for the possibility of continuing the case and assessing defendant’s\n\n                                             13.\n\fconduct in the future, the prosecutor felt it might be appropriate in some cases, but not in\ndefendant’s situation because, as Terrell stated, defendant would need a period of several\nyears in order for anyone to feel confidence his level of risk was reduced.\n       The court informed defense counsel that it did not consider counsel’s statements to\nbe evidence. Defense counsel responded that if the prosecutor wanted “backing on that,”\ncounsel could put defendant on the stand to support everything counsel said regarding the\naftermath of the “alleged” riot, and counsel could also call Terrell to confirm what they\ndiscussed, that he did not make his decision based on any statistics, and that it essentially\nwas a psychiatric examination. Counsel observed that a lengthy period of violation-free\nbehavior was not available in this case, and he asked the court to consider the defense’s\nthree possibilities: allowing defense counsel to present further evidence, in which case\ncounsel would need a hearing date toward the end of June; supervision or programs;\nand/or retain jurisdiction while defendant did an additional period in prison with the\nwarning “sink or swim.”\n       The prosecutor asked to comment, but the court refused, saying it was ready to\nrule. It stated:\n\n              “I’ve considered both comments, I have gone through the reports.…\n       [F]rankly, some of the suggestions each of you make are suggestions that,\n       had those who created the statute thought ahead, would be very useful to\n       the Court in this circumstance.\n\n               “However, [defense counsel], … I am more than concerned. I have\n       reviewed, as I do in every single one of these cases, I look for options,\n       recognizing the impact of the Court’s ruling and the finality of the ruling.\n       If I can find an option that I believe is appropriate and will assure this court\n       that the individual is not a danger, I pursue it. I don’t see that option here.\n\n              “[Defendant], as recently as 2010, while it might appear minor, had\n       a face-to-face confrontation with the correctional officer where he stated —\n       and pardon my language, but I need to be direct on the record — ‘Fuck\n       you, get your punk ass away from the door.’\n\n\n\n\n                                             14.\n\f              “Prior to that, he was found in possession of a four-and-half-inch-\n       long sharpened instrument. And, it — if that type of behavior was a decade\n       ago — but it’s not, it’s within the past three to four years.\n\n            “I find at this point that [defendant] does pose a danger of risk to the\n       community, and for those reasons his request for … resentencing is denied.\n\n             “While I perhaps do not need to supplement the record, the fact is as\n       [defendant] left the courtroom, his physical demeanor towards the Court\n       appeared to be at least threatening, if not directly confrontational.”\n                                      DISCUSSION\n                                              I\n             THE STANDARD OF PROOF AND THE TRIAL COURT’S FINDING\n       Subdivision (f) of section 1170.126 provides that where, as here, an inmate\npetitioner is eligible for resentencing under the Act, he or she “shall be resentenced [as a\nsecond strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n       Defendant contends the prosecution failed to prove “unreasonable risk of danger\nto public safety,” which we will sometimes call “dangerousness,” beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, thereby violating the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. The applicable standard of proof, however, is preponderance\nof the evidence. (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279,\n1301-1306 (Kaulick); accord, People v. Flores (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1075-1076;\nsee People v. Blakely (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1060-1062 [applying Kaulick to\ninitial eligibility determination]; People v. Osuna (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1038-\n1040 [same]; see generally People v. Arriaga (2014) 58 Cal.4th 950, 961-962.)\nDefendant argues Kaulick was wrongly decided, but we are not persuaded.\n       Considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126,6 we\nconclude the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,\n\n6     Section 1170.126, subdivision (g) provides: “In exercising its discretion in\nsubdivision (f), the court may consider: [¶] (1) The petitioner’s criminal conviction\n\n                                             15.\n\ffacts from which a determination resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety can reasonably be made. The reasons a trial court finds\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, or its weighing of evidence\nshowing dangerousness versus evidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the court’s\ndiscretion. The ultimate determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger is a discretionary one. While the determination must be supported by facts\nestablished by a preponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of\ndanger by a preponderance of the evidence. (See In re Robert L. (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th\n1057, 1065-1067 [discussing abuse of discretion and preponderance of the evidence\nstandards].)7\n       In the present case, the People established, by a preponderance of the evidence,\nfacts — particularly defendant’s prison disciplinary write-ups and lack of a record of\nmeaningful rehabilitation while incarcerated — from which the trial court reasonably\ncould find resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\n\n\nhistory, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length\nof prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The petitioner’s\ndisciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other\nevidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a\nnew sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n7      We reject defendant’s apparent suggestion due process requires at least a clear and\nconvincing evidence standard of proof. The situations noted by defendant in which such\na standard has been applied (see Conservatorship of Wendland (2001) 26 Cal.4th 519,\n546-548 & cases cited) are not analogous to the act of lenity contained in section\n1170.126.\n       We recognize that in the case of people who are involuntarily committed as\nnarcotics addicts or for analogous reasons, the California Supreme Court has found the\nappropriate standard of proof to be beyond a reasonable doubt. (See, e.g., People v.\nThomas (1977) 19 Cal.3d 630, 637-638.) Defendant received the protections of that\nstandard of proof (and the right to a jury trial) at the time he was found to have suffered\nhis prior strike convictions, however. (People v. Nguyen (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1007, 1015;\nPeople v. Towers (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1277.)\n\n\n                                             16.\n\fsafety.8 Because the trial court’s finding defendant currently posed an unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety did not “exceed[] the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances\nbeing considered” (People v. Giminez (1975) 14 Cal.3d 68, 72), it did not constitute an\nabuse of discretion.\n       Defendant argues, however, that what the court actually found was that defendant\nposed “a danger of risk to the community.” He says this finding was insufficient, as a\nmatter of law, to establish the “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” required by\nsubdivision (f) of section 1170.126 before resentencing could be denied.\n       It is apparent, from the oral and written submissions of the parties and probation\nofficer, and the court’s comments throughout the proceedings, that the court was aware of\nthe law on this point and the finding it was required to make. (See Evid. Code, § 664;\nPeople v. Diaz (1992) 3 Cal.4th 495, 567.) It is also apparent the court was convinced\nresentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. That\nit stated its finding unartfully does not mean it failed to make the requisite finding.\n\n\n\n\n8       The substantial evidence test applies to an appellate court’s review of findings\nmade under the preponderance of the evidence standard. (People v. Wong (2010) 186\nCal.App.4th 1433, 1444.) Under that test, the appellate court reviews the record in the\nlight most favorable to the challenged finding, to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nmake the finding by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court “resolve[s] all\nconflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility in favor of the [finding], and …\nindulge[s] every reasonable inference the [trier of fact] could draw from the evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       If a factor (for example, that the petitioner recently committed a battery, is violent\ndue to repeated instances of mutual combat, etc.) is not established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, it cannot form the basis for a finding of unreasonable risk. (See People v.\nCluff (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991, 998; cf. People v. Read (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 685,\n689-691.)\n\n\n                                             17.\n\f                                              II\n                                     JURY TRIAL RIGHT\n       Relying primarily on Alleyne v. United States (2013) 570 U.S. ___ [133 S.Ct.\n2151], defendant contends his Sixth Amendment jury trial right was violated by the fact\nthe court, rather than a jury, made the necessary finding of dangerousness. In Alleyne,\n“the United States Supreme Court held that the federal Constitution’s Sixth Amendment\nentitles a defendant to a jury trial, with a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof, as\nto ‘any fact that increases the mandatory minimum’ sentence for a crime.” (People v.\nNunez and Satele (2013) 57 Cal.4th 1, 39, fn. 6.)\n       “The denial of a recall petition [under the Act] does not increase the mandatory\nminimum sentence for a defendant’s crime.” (People v. Guilford (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th\n651, 663, fn. omitted.) As the Court of Appeal explained in Kaulick, supra, 215\nCal.App.4th 1279: “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly\nsituated to him, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life term to which\nhe was originally sentenced. While Proposition 36 presents him with an opportunity to\nbe resentenced to a lesser term, unless certain facts are established, he is nonetheless still\nsubject to the third strike sentence based on the facts established at the time he was\noriginally sentenced.” (Id. at p. 1303.) Because resentencing a petitioner under the Act\nis not constitutionally required, but rather “an act of lenity on the part of the electorate”\n(Kaulick, supra, at p. 1304) that “provides for a proceeding where the original sentence\nmay be modified downward (Id. at pp. 1304-1305), “[a]ny facts found at such a\nproceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth Amendment issues” (id. at\np. 1305; accord, People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1040).\n\n\n\n\n                                              18.\n\f                                              III\n                                 COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL\n       In a somewhat confusing argument, defendant next contends the trial court\nerroneously gave collateral estoppel effect to the various 115 violations contained in his\nprison disciplinary record. The record on appeal belies this assertion.9\n       “Collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues that were necessarily decided\nin prior litigation, but it operates only against those who were parties, or in privity with\nparties, to that prior litigation and who are thus bound by the resulting judgment. The\nparty seeking the benefit of the doctrine, by contrast, need not have been a party to the\nearlier lawsuit. [Citation.]” (Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 985.)\n“There are five threshold requirements: 1) the issue to be precluded must be identical to\nthat decided in the prior proceeding; 2) the issue must have been actually litigated at that\ntime; 3) the issue must have been necessarily decided; 4) the decision in the prior\nproceeding must be final and on the merits; and 5) the party against whom preclusion is\nsought must be in privity with the party to the former proceeding. [Citations.]” (People\nv. Garcia (2006) 39 Cal.4th 1070, 1077.)\n       As previously described, defendant incurred a number of 115 rule violations and\n128 disciplinary chronos during the course of his imprisonment. During the court and\nparties’ discussion of defendant’s disciplinary record, both counsel made a number of\nreferences to guilty or adverse “findings.” For instance, with respect to the 115 based on\nparticipation in a riot, the prosecutor referred to a “guilty finding” that defendant was a\nparticipant. Defense counsel agreed a guilty finding was made, but disagreed the finding\nwas based on evidence in the records.\n\n\n\n\n9     This being the case, we need not decide whether, as asserted by the Attorney\nGeneral, defendant forfeited his claim by failing to raise it below.\n\n\n                                             19.\n\f       We fail to discern anything wrong with the parties’ references to the prison’s\n“findings.” Our reading of the record does not suggest the prosecutor was seeking to\nhave the court give preclusive effect to the prison’s findings, but rather he was arguing\ndefendant’s denials of wrongdoing and innocent explanations lacked credibility.\nWhatever the prosecutor’s intent, it is absolutely clear from the record that the court took\ndefendant’s explanations, claims of self-defense, and denials of wrongdoing fully into\naccount in reaching its decision, and did not give preclusive effect to prison findings.\n                                              IV\n                             REFUSAL OF DEFENSE EVIDENCE\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion or failed to exercise\ninformed discretion, denied defendant his right to a full and fair adversarial proceeding,\nand violated his right to due process, by its “refusal” of defense evidence of (1) actuarial\ndocuments and research, and (2) cross-examination of Terrell. We conclude that if error\noccurred, it was harmless.\n       “Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, [citation], or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation clauses of the\nSixth Amendment, [citations], the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants ‘a\nmeaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.’ [Citations.] We break no new\nground in observing that an essential component of procedural fairness is an opportunity\nto be heard. [Citations.]” (Crane v. Kentucky (1986) 476 U.S. 683, 690, italics added.)\nThe parties to a resentencing proceeding pursuant to section 1170.126, subdivision (f)\nhave a right, both as a matter of due process and of judicial discretion, to a full and fair\nadversarial proceeding in which they may present evidence and argument. (Kaulick,\nsupra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1297-1298.)10\n\n10     We recognize a criminal defendant is not necessarily guaranteed the same panoply\nof rights at sentencing as he or she is at trial. (See, e.g., Williams v. New York (1949) 337\nU.S. 241, 251.) For example, it has been held a defendant has no right to cross-examine a\n\n                                             20.\n\f       Nothing in the record before us suggests defendant was precluded from presenting\nevidence at either the initial or the continued hearing; rather, it appears he was not\nprepared to do so.11 The trial court appointed Terrell on April 19, 2013. Terrell\nexamined defendant on May 17, 2013, and his report was dated May 19, 2013. The\nrecord contains no explanation why defense counsel did not speak to Terrell, and/or send\nhim the actuarial materials, before Terrell spoke with defendant or at least before he\nprepared his report, particularly in light of the fact Terrell had before him a letter from\ndefense counsel dated April 22, 2013, and the trial court had warned the hearing would\nnot be continued further. The record also contains no indication defense counsel\nattempted to subpoena Terrell, or otherwise obtain his presence, for the hearing with a\nview to cross-examining him on his report.\n       Significantly, defendant’s age and age’s effect on recidivism were before the court\nin Terrell’s report, albeit perhaps not to the extent defendant would have liked, and the\nprosecutor did not dispute that evidence. The bottom line was not what actuarial\nevidence would show, but what evidence concerning this defendant showed regarding his\nlikelihood of recidivism, particularly with respect to crimes of violence. The court\ndeclared itself “more than concerned” by incidents that occurred within the past three to\nfour years, and a fair reading of the record shows the court denied defendant’s petition for\nresentencing based in large part on those recent incidents. Under the circumstances,\ndefendant and his counsel did indeed “enjoy[] a full and fair opportunity to marshal and\npresent the case supporting a favorable exercise of discretion” (People v. Rodriguez\n(1998) 17 Cal.4th 253, 258, italics added) and, in light of the evidence and information\n\nprobation officer who prepared a probation report. (People v. Smith (1985) 38 Cal.3d\n945, 960.) It is unclear whether this limitation extends to an expert like Terrell in a\nsection 1170.126 proceeding. (See People v. Arbuckle (1978) 22 Cal.3d 749, 753-756.)\nIn any event, we need not decide the extent of a petitioner’s rights at a resentencing\nproceeding under the Act.\n11     Defendant did present some evidence, in the form of his sworn declaration.\n\n\n                                             21.\n\falready before the court and the court’s comments and basis for its denial of resentencing,\nany erroneous refusal of evidence could not have prejudiced defendant (see, e.g., People\nv. Rutterschmidt (2012) 55 Cal.4th 650, 660-661; People v. Ramos (2004) 34 Cal.4th\n494, 528).\n                                              V\n                         INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n       Defendant contends counsel was prejudicially ineffective. The burden of proving\nineffective assistance of counsel is on the defendant. (People v. Pope (1979) 23 Cal.3d\n412, 425.) “To secure reversal … upon the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel\nunder either the state or federal Constitution, a defendant must establish (1) that defense\ncounsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, i.e., that\ncounsel’s performance did not meet the standard to be expected of a reasonably\ncompetent attorney, and (2) that there is a reasonable probability that defendant would\nhave obtained a more favorable result absent counsel’s shortcomings. [Citations.] ‘A\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\noutcome.’ [Citations.]” (People v. Cunningham (2001) 25 Cal.4th 926, 1003; see\ngenerally Strickland v. Washington (1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687-694.)\n       Defendant contends counsel’s performance was deficient because, he asserts,\ncounsel unreasonably “kept himself in the dark” about Terrell’s analysis; failed, in a\ntimely manner, to consult Terrell, ask “the relevant actuarial question,” and provide the\nrelevant actuarial documents and research; and failed to subpoena Terrell to the hearing.\n“Even assuming for argument’s sake that a competent attorney would have taken the\nactions defendant suggests, he fails to meet his burden of establishing, as a demonstrable\nreality, the prejudice requisite to a meritorious claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n[Citation.] ‘[A] court need not determine whether counsel’s performance was deficient\nbefore examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged\ndeficiencies.’ [Citation.] On this record, which amply supports the determination\n\n                                             22.\n\f[resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety], we\ncannot say a more favorable outcome was reasonably probable had counsel [presented\nadditional information or materials to Terrell or evidence to the court, consulted Terrell in\na timely manner, or otherwise changed the manner in which he dealt with Terrell and\nTerrell’s analysis].” (People v. Lawley (2002) 27 Cal.4th 102, 136.)\n                                             VI\n                    FAILURE TO EXERCISE INFORMED DISCRETION\n       Defendant contends the matter must be reversed and remanded for an informed\nexercise of discretion, because the trial court misunderstood the scope of its discretion,\nand erred as a matter of law, in concluding section 1170.126 did not authorize a lengthy\ncontinuance to afford defendant the opportunity to prove himself. We conclude the trial\ncourt lacked jurisdiction to grant such a continuance, and so did not err.\n       “Generally, when the record shows that the trial court proceeded with sentencing\non the erroneous assumption it lacked discretion, remand is necessary so that the trial\ncourt may have the opportunity to exercise its sentencing discretion at a new sentencing\nhearing. [Citations.] Defendants are entitled to ‘sentencing decisions made in the\nexercise of the “informed discretion” of the sentencing court,’ and a court that is unaware\nof its discretionary authority cannot exercise its informed discretion. [Citation.] [¶]\nRemand for resentencing is not required, however, if the record demonstrates the trial\ncourt was aware of its sentencing discretion. [Citations.] Further, remand is unnecessary\nif the record is silent concerning whether the trial court misunderstood its sentencing\ndiscretion. Error may not be presumed from a silent record. [Citation.]” (People v.\nBrown (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1213, 1228-1229; see People v. Downey (2000) 82\nCal.App.4th 899, 912.)\n       We are not convinced the record establishes the trial court would have granted\ndefendant’s alternative request for a lengthy continuance had it believed it had discretion\nto do so. All the court stated in that regard was, “[S]ome of the suggestions each of you\n\n                                             23.\n\fmake are suggestions that, had those who created the statute thought ahead, would be\nvery useful to the Court in this circumstance. [¶] … I have reviewed, as I do in every\nsingle one of these cases, I look for options, recognizing the impact of the Court’s ruling\nand the finality of the ruling. If I can find an option that I believe is appropriate and will\nassure this court that the individual is not a danger, I pursue it. I don’t see that option\nhere.” (Italics added.) It then turned to a discussion of recent incidents that caused it to\nbe “more than concerned.”\n       In any event, we conclude the trial court had no discretion to grant a lengthy\ncontinuance, or otherwise retain jurisdiction for a period of time, so defendant could\n“prove” himself. Subdivision (b) of section 1170.126 allows any inmate who falls within\nthe Act’s provisions to file a petition for a recall of sentence within two years of the Act’s\neffective date (Nov. 7, 2012), or at a later date upon a showing of good cause.\nSubdivision (f) of the statute requires the court, “[u]pon receiving a petition,” to\ndetermine the petitioner’s eligibility for resentencing, and, if the petitioner is eligible, to\nresentence him or her unless the court finds dangerousness.\n       The language of the statute as a whole, as well as evidence of the electorate’s\nintent in enacting Proposition 36 shown in the ballot materials related to the Act (see\ngenerally Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) Prop. 36, pp. 48-53)\ndemonstrates the proper focus in a resentencing proceeding under the Act, as in parole\ncases, is on whether the petitioner currently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety. (Cf. In re Shaputis (2008) 44 Cal.4th 1241, 1254; In re Lawrence (2008)\n44 Cal.4th 1181, 1214.) There is a crucial distinction between resentencing proceedings\nunder the Act and parole cases, however. The parole board can find an inmate serving a\nlife term unsuitable for parole, but rehear the matter within a certain time to assess his or\nher behavior in prison, among other factors, to determine his or her dangerousness. The\nAct contains no such provision. Rather, it provides for a one-time determination of a\npetition filed within two years of the Act’s effective date.\n\n                                              24.\n\f       Construing the statutory language in the context of the statute as a whole and the\noverall statutory scheme, as we are required to do (People v. Rizo (2000) 22 Cal.4th 681,\n685), we find nothing that expressly or implicitly authorizes a court to continue or\notherwise hold in abeyance a petition for resentencing for the purpose of reexamining the\ninmate’s dangerousness. To the contrary, the Act’s limiting an inmate to the filing of a\nsingle petition for resentencing within two years of the Act’s effective date indicates an\nintent to resolve such petitions within a finite time period. The drafters of the Act could\nhave created a statutory scheme to allow the court to retain jurisdiction to reevaluate the\ndanger posed periodically or at some future time. They did not do so. Moreover, the\nvoter information guide states the Act will result in a one-time cost related to handling\nthe resentencing petitions, not periodic evaluations to review an inmate’s fitness for\nresentencing and possible release. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012),\nsupra, analysis of Prop. 36 by Legis. Analyst, p. 50.)12\n                                             VII\n                                      PROPOSITION 47\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\n\n\n\n\n12     Defendant points out that a petition for resentencing may be filed beyond the two-\nyear limitation upon a showing of good cause. (§ 1170.126, subd. (b).) This is true.\nThat a court has the power to find good cause to excuse a late petition does not mean,\nhowever, it has the power to defer a ruling in order to monitor subsequent conduct.\n\n\n                                              25.\n\fpetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).)13\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision the\nparties address in their supplemental briefs. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides:\n“As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists what are sometimes called “super strike”\noffenses.14\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\n\n\n\n13    Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n14     As set out in subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) of section 667, those felonies are: “(I) A\n‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 6600 of the Welfare\nand Institutions Code. [¶] (II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age,\nand who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 288a,\nsodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more than 10 years\nyounger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual penetration with another\nperson who is under 14 years of age, and who is more than 10 years younger than he or\nshe, as defined by Section 289. [¶] (III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under\n14 years of age, in violation of Section 288. [¶] (IV) Any homicide offense, including\nany attempted homicide offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive. [¶]\n(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f. [¶] (VI) Assault with a\nmachine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision\n(d) of Section 245. [¶] (VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418. [¶] (VIII) Any serious and/or violent\nfelony offense punishable in California by life imprisonment or death.”\n\n\n                                            26.\n\foffense. Defendant says it does, and it applies retroactively to his pending appeal. The\nPeople disagree. We agree with the People.15\n        “‘In interpreting a voter initiative …, we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] ‘“The fundamental purpose of statutory\nconstruction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of\nthe law. [Citations.]”’ [Citation.]” (People v. Superior Court (Cervantes) (2014) 225\nCal.App.4th 1007, 1014.) Thus, in the case of a provision adopted by the voters, “their\nintent governs. [Citations.]” (People v. Jones (1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142, 1146.)\n        To determine intent, “‘we look first to the words themselves. [Citations.]’”\n(People v. Superior Court (Cervantes), supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1014.) “‘“When\nstatutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction and courts\nshould not indulge in it.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Hendrix (1997) 16 Cal.4th\n508, 512.) On its face, “[a]s used throughout this Code,” as employed in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c), clearly and unambiguously refers to the Penal Code, not merely section\n1170.18 or the other provisions of Proposition 47. (See People v. Bucchierre (1943) 57\nCal.App.2d 153, 164-165, 166; see also Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist.\n(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1254-1255; People v. Vasquez (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 763,\n766.)\n        This does not mean, however, that the definition contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) must inexorably be read into section 1170.126, subdivision (f). (Cf.\nMarshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at p. 1255.) “The\nliteral language of a statute does not prevail if it conflicts with the lawmakers’ intent .…\n[Citations.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1033-1034.) “‘The\n\n\n15     The issues presented here are currently on review before the California Supreme\nCourt in People v. Chaney (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1391, review granted February 18,\n2015, S223676; People v. Valencia (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 514, review granted\nFebruary 18, 2015, S223825; and numerous other cases.\n\n\n                                             27.\n\fapparent purpose of a statute will not be sacrificed to a literal construction.’ [Citation.]”\n(Cossack v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 726, 733.) Rather, “the literal meaning\nof a statute must be in accord with its purpose.” (People v. Mohammed (2008) 162\nCal.App.4th 920, 927.) “[I]t is settled that the language of a statute should not be given a\nliteral meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences that the [voters] did not\nintend” (In re Michele D. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 600, 606), or would “frustrate[] the manifest\npurposes of the legislation as a whole .…” (People v. Williams (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th\n1389, 1393.) “To this extent, therefore, intent prevails over the letter of the law and the\nletter will be read in accordance with the spirit of the enactment. [Citation.]” (In re\nMichele D., supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 606; accord, People v. Ledesma (1997) 16 Cal.4th 90,\n95.)\n       Thus, “‘we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be\nachieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, …, and the\nstatutory scheme of which the statute is a part. [Citations.]’ [Citation.] We also ‘“refer\nto other indicia of the voters’ intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in\nthe official ballot pamphlet.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at p. 1034.) We consider “the consequences that will flow from a particular\ninterpretation” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com. (1987) 43 Cal.3d\n1379, 1387), as well as “the wider historical circumstances” of the statute’s or statutes’\nenactment (ibid.). “‘Using these extrinsic aids, we “select the construction that comports\nmost closely with the apparent intent of the [electorate], with a view to promoting rather\nthan defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would\nlead to absurd consequences.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1034-1035.)\n       Proposition 47 and the Act address related, but not identical, subjects. Reading\nthem together, and considering section 1170.18, subdivision (c) in the context of the\nstatutory framework as a whole (see People v. Acosta (2002) 29 Cal.4th 105, 112; Lakin\n\n                                             28.\n\fv. Watkins Associated Industries (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 658-659; In re Cindy B. (1987)\n192 Cal.App.3d 771, 781), we conclude its literal meaning does not comport with the\npurpose of the Act, and applying it to resentencing proceedings under the Act would\nfrustrate, rather than promote, that purpose and the intent of the electorate in enacting\nboth initiative measures (see People v. Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the will of\nCalifornians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation be given\nprecedence in determining the appropriate punishment for crimes. Further, those goals\nwere best achieved by ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for\nsecond and third ‘strikes.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 815, 824.)16\n       A few months before the November 6, 2012, election, the California Supreme\nCourt observed: “One aspect of the [three strikes] law that has proven controversial is\nthat the lengthy punishment prescribed by the law may be imposed not only when … a\ndefendant [who has previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies]\nis convicted of another serious or violent felony but also when he or she is convicted of\nany offense that is categorized under California law as a felony. This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley (2012) 55 Cal.4th 524, 528-529.)\n       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., supra, text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\n\n16    This applies equally to the three strikes initiative measure that added section\n1170.12 to the Penal Code. (See Historical and Statutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann. Pen.\nCode (2015 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 376.)\n\n\n                                             29.\n\fNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\nresult is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory\nunder the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)),\nand that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an\narray of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2)).\n       Significantly, nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given\nany indication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. (See,\ne.g., Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis.\nAnalyst, pp. 35, 36; id., argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38; id., rebuttal to argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in section\n1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…”\n       We recognize “[i]t is an established rule of statutory construction … that when\nstatutes are in pari materia similar phrases appearing in each should be given like\nmeanings. [Citations.]” (People v. Caudillo (1978) 21 Cal.3d 562, 585, overruled on\nanother ground in People v. Martinez (1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 229, 237, fn. 6 &\n\n                                             30.\n\fdisapproved on another ground in People v. Escobar (1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 749-751 &\nfn. 5; see Robbins v. Omnibus R. Co. (1867) 32 Cal. 472, 474.) We question whether\nProposition 47 and the Act are truly in pari materia: That phrase means “[o]n the same\nsubject; relating to the same matter” (Black’s Law Dict. (9th ed. 2009) p. 862), and the\ntwo measures (albeit with some overlap) address different levels of offenses and\noffenders. In any event, “canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining\nprobable legislative intent” (Stone v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 521, fn. 10);\nthey are “mere guides and will not be applied so as to defeat the underlying legislative\nintent otherwise determined [citation]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing\nCom., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1391).\n       The Act was intended to reform the three strikes law while keeping intact that\nscheme’s core commitment to public safety. Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Constraining that discretion so that all but the worst felony offenders are\nreleased manifestly does not, nor does it comport with voters’ intent in enacting either\nProposition 36 or Proposition 47.\n       Accordingly, Proposition 47 has no effect on defendant’s petition for resentencing\nunder the Act. Defendant is not entitled to a remand with directions to resentence him to\na second-strike term.17\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n17     Were we to conclude section 1170.18, subdivision (c) modifies section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), we would conclude it does not do so retroactively. Because we believe a\nfinding of nonretroactivity would raise serious equal protection issues, we rest our\nholding on the reasoning set out in our opinion, ante. (See People v. Skinner (1985) 39\nCal.3d 765, 769.)\n\n\n                                            31.\n\f",

(c)) or serious (as defined by § 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a\npetition for resentencing under the Act. The trial court found defendant represented an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety and denied the petition.\n       We hold (1) the People met their burden of proving, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, facts on which a finding that resentencing defendant would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety reasonably could be based; (2) the trial\ncourt’s finding defendant posed a risk to the community was sufficient, under the\ncircumstances, to establish an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, and the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in so finding; (3) the trial court’s finding of\ndangerousness did not violate defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury;\n(4) the trial court did not erroneously apply collateral estoppel to contested rules\nviolations; (5) any error in the trial court’s refusal of defense evidence was harmless;\n(6) defendant has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel; (7) defendant had\nno right to a continuance to allow him the opportunity to prove himself; and (8) recently\nenacted section 1170.18, subdivision (c) does not modify section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n                                               2.\n\f                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       On November 5, 1999, defendant was convicted of attempted second degree\nburglary (§§ 459, 664; count one) and second degree burglary (§ 459; count two). He\nwas sentenced to concurrent terms of 25 years to life in prison pursuant to sections 667,\nsubdivisions (b) through (i) and 1170.12.\n       On November 15, 2012, defendant petitioned for resentencing under\nsection 1170.126. The trial court made a preliminary finding defendant was eligible for\nresentencing, appointed counsel, and provisionally set the matter for hearing.2 Several\ncontinuances were granted, in part so the parties could obtain and review pertinent court\nand prison records.\n       The People ultimately opposed the petition, asserting resentencing defendant\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. They pointed to defendant’s\nlengthy, increasingly violent record, and set out a number of his offenses. In 1979, as a\njuvenile, defendant robbed a liquor store clerk at gun point. As an adult, defendant was\nconvicted of five counts of robbery with use of a firearm for robberies committed during\n1983 and 1984. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. In 1987, approximately two\nmonths after he was released on parole, he committed another armed robbery. He was\nconvicted of several offenses arising out of that incident and sentenced to 11 years in\nprison. He violated parole in 1995, was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of\ndomestic violence in 1998, and perpetrated the commitment offenses — vehicle burglary\nand attempted vehicle burglary — on August 12, 1999, while he was on probation for the\ndomestic violence offenses.\n       The People also related defendant’s prison classification score was 128, well\nabove the minimum score of 19 for a life offender. They noted his “extensive”\n\n2     Although we refer to the trial court, the judge who originally sentenced defendant\nwas no longer on the bench at the time the resentencing petition was filed. Accordingly,\nanother judge was assigned to rule on the petition. (See § 1170.126, subd. (j).)\n\n\n                                             3.\n\fdisciplinary write-ups and periods of housing in administrative segregation, and\npresented summaries of a number of California Department of Corrections and\nRehabilitation (CDCR) 115 rule violation reports (“115’s”) and disciplinary chronos\n(“128’s”), together with reasons defendant was placed in administrative segregation or\nthe security housing unit (SHU).3 The 115’s for which defendant was found guilty\nincluded, but were not limited to:\n     Participation in a riot (Jan. 11, 2012): Full riot, with defendant identified as a\nparticipant.4\n     Destruction of state property (Dec. 15, 2010): Defendant destroyed a sheet and\nwhen spoken to, said, “‘FUCK YOU, GET YOUR PUNK ASS AWAY FROM MY\nDOOR.’”\n     Fighting (June 22, 2010): Defendant was swinging both fists toward another\ninmate.\n     Possession of inmate weapon (Jan. 12, 2009): A fight between defendant and\nanother inmate was observed. The inmates were ordered to the ground, but failed to\ncomply and were pepper sprayed. The inmates separated, and defendant was ordered to\nshow his hands. He refused, and flung an object toward the stairwell. A piece of hard\nplastic, four and one-half inches long and one inch wide, sharpened to a point with the\nother end wrapped in cloth as a handle, was recovered.\n     Battery on a peace officer (Oct. 17, 2006): An officer delivering milk to\ndefendant’s cell asked defendant to turn on a bright light. Defendant appeared agitated.\n\n3       “A ‘CDC 115’ violation is one that is ‘believed to be a violation of law or [that] is\nnot minor in nature,’ and a ‘128 disciplinary chrono’ is minor misconduct that recurs\nafter verbal counseling.

(a)(2), (3).)\n4      The People’s recitation of defendant’s housing history showed defendant was\ncontinued in the administrative segregation unit on several occasions following the riot\ndue to his promoting continued violence between Southern Hispanics and Black gangs.\n\n\n                                              4.\n\fAs the milk was placed on the security port door, defendant swatted at it and the cartons\nflew into the officer’s leg.\n    Indecent exposure (Sept. 18, 2005): During count, defendant was observed to\nhave his shorts pulled down while he was masturbating. He made no effort to stop or\ncover himself when the light shined into his cell.\n    Disrespect to staff (Dec. 10, 2004): Defendant was asked why he was in a\nparticular area and for identification. He claimed not to have his identification card. A\nsearch of his person revealed the card. Asked why he lied, he responded, “‘FUCK YOU\nPUNK’” and called the correctional officer names.\n    Theft (Apr. 2, 2004): While the clerk at receiving and release was distracted with\nanother inmate, defendant took a television and Walkman and put them in a box. The\ntelevision later was recovered from his cell and the Walkman was found elsewhere.\n       The People acknowledged defendant had “very modest” work and vocational\nhistory, but pointed out he had not taken advantage of any substance-related\nprogramming, anger management, or any program that might assist him in gaining insight\ninto antisocial behaviors. They asserted defendant had no documented self-help\nprogramming other than a brief period of participation in the Lifer Group, and argued he\ncontinued to exhibit poor impulse control and behaviors exhibiting violence and defiance,\nwhile doing little or nothing to address the factors involved in his criminality.\n       Defendant submitted a sworn declaration, in which he conceded he had a number\nof 115’s and 128’s, but claimed only some were true, most were not, and others had\nmitigating circumstances. Defendant gave the following explanations for some of them:\n    Participation in a riot (115 rule violation dated Jan. 11, 2012): Defendant was on\nthe prison yard when, without warning, about 150 Black and Hispanic inmates began to\nbrawl. Defendant backed against a wall and deflected attempts to assault him, but did not\nfight. He claimed medical records concerning treatment provided to participants would\nshow he was one of the few without injury. Nevertheless, on February 8, 2012, he was\n\n                                              5.\n\frandomly selected, along with 20 others, for a four-month stint in SHU for his alleged\nparticipation.\n    Destruction of state property (115 rule violation dated Dec. 12, 2010): Defendant\nwas assigned to a new cell, in which the current occupant had hung a sheet for privacy.\n“Somehow,” defendant was blamed. Although the sheet was undamaged, he was charged\n$15 out of his commissary money.\n    Fighting (115 rule violations dated June 2, 2010, and June 22, 2010): While in\nchurch, defendant was “sucker-punched” by another inmate. The assault cut defendant\nabove his right eye, and he grabbed the other inmate to smother the attack, but threw no\npunches. They fell to the floor and guards interceded. The prison hearing officer ruled it\na mutual combat, although defendant disagreed. On the second date, the same inmate\nagain attempted to assault defendant.\n    Delaying a prison official (115 rule violation dated Sept. 23, 2009): Defendant\nrefused to have a certain individual as his cellmate, because the inmate was well known\nto defendant to be a dangerous man.\n    Possession of a weapon (115 rule violation dated Jan. 12, 2009): Defendant was\nfound with a sharpened toothbrush. He admitted possessing it, but explained he did so\nfor protection, having been threatened earlier with a stabbing by another inmate.\nDefendant related he had been “‘shanked’” several times over the years while in prison,\nwith the attack on one occasion nearly puncturing his lung.\n    Disrespecting others/staff (115 rule violations dated Aug. 15, 2008, Dec. 18, 2004,\n& Feb. 5, 2004): Defendant considered the correctional officers at High Desert State\nPrison, where he was held in 2008, “particularly racist.” One of the female guards\ninterfered with his mail and he called her a “‘white bitch,’” which he realized he should\nnot have done. Twice in 2004, he used “the ‘F’ word” on disrespectful Folsom staff.\n    Failure to attend school (128 disciplinary chronos dated July 31, 2008, Apr. 28,\n2004, & Jan. 1, 2004): Defendant initially consented to go to classes, but soon learned\n\n                                            6.\n\fthe instruction was at elementary school level. Defendant was a high school graduate and\nwanted to attend college preparation or adult school, but such courses were not offered.\n    Battery on a prison official (115 rule violation dated Oct. 17, 2006): A\ncorrectional officer slid two milk cartons on a tray through the food slot in defendant’s\ncell. Defendant, who had just awakened and was still groggy, clumsily reached for them\nand accidentally knocked both out of the hole. He was told one struck the guard on the\nleg.\n    Stealing/unauthorized acquisition (115 rule violations dated Jan. 25, 2006, &\nApr. 2, 2004): In 2006, defendant purchased food for his cellmate, using the cellmate’s\nidentification with his consent. This was against prison rules. In 2004, defendant went to\nthe receiving and release office to pick up several boxes of his own property. The\nattendant waved his hand at a pile and said they were defendant’s and defendant could\ntake them. When defendant got back to his cell, he opened a box and realized it was\nsomeone else’s property. He was telling another inmate to notify a guard when a guard\nappeared and accused defendant of theft.\n    Indecent exposure (115 rule violation dated Sept. 18, 2005): Defendant was lying\nin bed, masturbating, around 3:00 a.m., when he realized a female guard was shining a\nflashlight on him. He denied purposely exposing himself to her or attempting to prolong\nthe encounter.\n    Grooming (128 disciplinary chronos dated Sept. 28, 2004, & Jan. 1, 2004): On\none occasion, defendant did not shave for a few days. On the other, he purposely began\nto grow a goatee. Both were in violation of Folsom’s appearance regulations. Defendant\nshaved when faced with loss of yard privileges.\n       In his declaration, defendant stated he was currently 50 years old. He denied\ninitiating any fights while in prison or being affiliated with any prison gang. He admitted\ndefending himself on occasion, but never to a greater extent than necessary. He related\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\fthat he had family who would help with his transition into the community, he would stay\nwith his brother, and his brother had lined up work for him.\n       The petition was heard on April 19, 2013. The court stated it had read the\nPeople’s opposition and defendant’s declaration, and reviewed defendant’s file. It found\n“things of concern” in defendant’s custodial behavior. Although defendant had addressed\nsome of them, the court permitted defense counsel to “amplify” the explanations\ncontained in defendant’s declaration.\n       Turning first to the rule violation for participation in a riot, defense counsel stated\nthere were many documents related to the incident that contained various correctional\nofficers’ observations of participants, and defendant was not mentioned until the riot was\nover. Counsel noted defendant had no injuries, which, he argued, gave credence to\ndefendant’s claim he backed into the safest area he could and deflected all assaults on\nhim. The prosecutor responded that in order to be “convict[ed]” of a 115, participation,\nnot mere presence, was required. He represented evidence of defendant’s participation\nwas found.5 The prosecutor conceded there was no evidence defendant instigated or was\na “main player” in the incident, but he asserted defendant was a participant, and that was\n“what was sustained in a guilty finding.” Defense counsel responded that according to\ndefendant, he was accused of participating at the hearing, he denied it, and a guilty\nfinding was made.\n       The court stated that, in looking at the “hierarchy” of conduct, it differentiated\nbetween “affirmative assaultive behavior” — particularly on correctional staff — and\n“defensive assaultive behavior.” It found no affirmative assaultive behavior on\ncorrectional staff in defendant’s background, but inquired about defendant’s possession\nof a sharpened toothbrush. The prosecutor agreed the weapon was not used, but argued\n\n\n5     Although it was this prosecutor’s practice to summarize, rather than submit, the\nunderlying prison documents, he had them available for the court’s review.\n\n\n                                              8.\n\fthat by defendant’s own statement, it was being held for use, and even keeping it in a\ndefensive manner suggested a willingness to apply deadly force. Defendant responded\nthat he was holding the toothbrush for protection against the same inmate who had\nassaulted him. As for the fighting in 2010, the prosecutor asserted defendant was a full\nparticipant in the fight and appeared to be the aggressor. Defense counsel related that\nwhen defendant denied starting the fight, the hearing officer deemed it mutual combat.\nThe prosecutor pointed out the finding was “fighting,” not “mutual combat,” and that\nwhile the prosecutor did not know whether defendant’s assertion he was sucker punched\nwas true, defendant was observed beating the other inmate.\n       The court next turned to the November 2006 finding of battery on a peace officer,\nwhich was based on the milk carton incident. It noted it did not appear a weapon was\nused or the officer injured. The prosecutor agreed with that assessment, but argued the\nconcern was defendant’s attitude, which he exhibited during that period of his\nincarceration, and his defiant conduct. The prosecutor also suggested defendant was\n“engaging in a little revision of the history.”\n       The court stated it did not appreciate defendant’s conduct, but, it acknowledged,\n“the prison atmosphere is a much different atmosphere. The behavior that occurs in\nprison appearing in a significantly different societal structure than out in public.” The\ncourt also acknowledged the prosecutor’s position, which was that there were rules in\nprison, and prisoners should follow those rules. The prosecutor argued there could be no\ndoubt from the record that defendant had “an attitude problem,” and there was no\nsuggestion defendant had changed or would no longer engage in “defiant and difficult\nconduct” if released from prison.\n       Defense counsel responded that defendant had not incurred any 115’s since\nJanuary 2012, thus indicating defendant’s behavior had indeed improved. He noted\ndefendant’s brother was present to discuss “outpatient” plans. Defendant’s older brother,\nMelvin Collins, represented to the court that he had a stable home, and defendant would\n\n                                              9.\n\fbe able to stay with him. Collins suggested they could work together at truck driving and\nthat there were “[l]ots of things in the fire,” but the outcome of the resentencing hearing\nhad to be known first.\n       Defense counsel stated he was very familiar with actuarial research, and at\ndefendant’s age, it was “highly unlikely,” unless there was “some severe pathology,” that\na person would continue to engage in robbery or “gross assaults” or similar offenses.\nDefense counsel noted the court was probably aware of that fact, but offered to provide\nthe court with articles and other materials if the court was interested. The court declined,\nbut confirmed defendant was born in 1962 and was 50 years old at the time of the\nhearing. The prosecutor stated he was also familiar with the data concerning age, and\nthat he had no objection to the court getting a risk assessment, but he cautioned against\ngeneralizing. He pointed out that defendant’s criminal history dated back to when he was\na juvenile, he failed probation and parole, and he persisted in his behaviors throughout his\nincarceration. The prosecutor argued defendant’s disciplinary violations were “very\nserious 115s in the context of a criminal history that is abysmal,” and he urged the court\nto consider “a collective review of [defendant’s] entire history, as well as his attitude and\ndemeanor.”\n       The court decided it wanted a risk assessment factoring in age. It declined to give\na tentative ruling, but referred the matter to the probation department to obtain an\nindependent determination. The court stated:\n\n       “This is — I don’t want to mislead [defendant]. This is a close call. [The\n       prosecutor] makes a very valid point. On the other hand, what is significant\n       to the Court is [the prosecutor’s] points are factually accurate. It is\n       significant to the Court, … that while I’m not excusing [defendant’s]\n       conduct at all — for instance, the possession of the inmate manufactured\n       weapon that [the prosecutor] notes to appear to be for defense purposes,\n       there is nothing in the record. [Prosecutor], I understand your point, a\n       weapon is a weapon, and its presence in the institution creates a danger, per\n       se; however, does not appear that there is any indication that [defendant]\n       was possessing it to affirmatively attack given the previous attacks against\n\n\n                                             10.\n\f       him, and the way in which it apparently was possessed. It appears to be a\n       defense weapon, as does [defendant’s] conduct.\n\n               “So — I don’t — I understand [the prosecutor’s] argument. If I\n       agree to everything [the prosecutor] was saying, I deny it today. So that is\n       why I am referring it over, because I think there is another side to this that\n       creates a legitimate finding that [defendant], while perhaps not exemplar in\n       the institution, would not create such a danger to the community under\n       [section] 1170.126, that he should not be resentenced. I will … ask\n       specifically for a risk assessment factoring in age.”\n       The court appointed Dr. Terrell to conduct the risk assessment, and continued the\nmatter to a specific date for receipt of the report and the court’s decision. The court told\ndefendant: “I will decide it that day. If there is too much there, and you are not\nappropriate for resentencing, I won’t resentence you. I don’t know if it helps you or not,\nbut we will make that decision that day. I will not continue it out after that. It is set over\nto that date. [¶] … It is a close call. But I wouldn’t refer you to probation if I didn’t\nthink there was a legitimate reason to resentence you. I haven’t made a decision.”\n       The probation officer filed a report that related defendant said he had attended\nnumerous religious classes since 2000, and completed a six month “Lifers” group course\nin 2008 and a 90-day behavioral management course, designed to deal with anger and\nstress issues, in October 2012. The probation officer also noted prison documentation\nshowing defendant received two certificates of accomplishment in August 2010 for\nkeyboarding, as well as a certificate of achievement for completing a course on office\nservices and related technologies. Defendant told the probation officer he had changed\nhis life from what he used to be, and was ready to be a productive citizen. Based on a\nreview of defendant’s prior criminal history and disciplinary history while incarcerated,\nhowever, the probation officer observed: “While [defendant] states that he has changed,\nhis documented performance reveals otherwise. This officer notes that prison life\nrequires adjustments and is a stressful environment; however, it appears that the\ndefendant has not taken advantage of opportunities to make positive changes.”\n\n\n\n                                             11.\n\fAccordingly, the probation officer recommended the court find defendant to be an\nunreasonable risk to public safety and that resentencing be denied.\n       Terrell submitted a report in which, in part, he related that the primary reason for\ndefendant’s longstanding criminal history was most likely defendant’s antisocial\npersonality disorder. Terrell also noted, however, that people with antisocial personality\ndisorder often show a decrease in their criminal behavior as they enter the fourth decade\nof life. Terrell stated it appeared defendant had been in slightly less trouble over the\npreceding five years or so; however, Terrell pronounced himself “gravely concerned” by\ndefendant being in possession of a prison-made weapon in 2009, his reported\nparticipation in a prison riot, and his reported efforts to encourage more violence and\nretaliation at the prison after the 2012 riot. Terrell opined that defendant represented a\nmoderate to high risk of violence to the community if released. He stated he would feel\nmore optimistic about defendant’s prognosis if and when defendant could maintain a\nperiod of at least four to five years without any antisocial, violent, or assaultive behavior.\nTerrell recommended denial of release at the present time.\n       The continued hearing was held on May 24, 2013. The court stated it had read and\nconsidered the probation officer’s and Terrell’s reports. Defense counsel stated that he\nspoke to Terrell after receiving the report, and Terrell related that he accepted virtually\neverything from the CDCR records “as gospel.” When defense counsel mentioned\nactuarials indicating a 50-year-old man was not going to be recidivating, particularly in a\nviolent fashion, as a 25- or 30-year-old would, Terrell said he was unfamiliar with them.\nDefense counsel then sent Terrell several hundred pages of studies and other information\non that point, because Terrell said he might be willing to reconsider.\n       Defense counsel argued that defendant had no actual violence until about 2009,\nwhen he was attacked and armed himself in self-defense. As for the riot, defendant had\nno notice beforehand that it was going to occur, and he had very passive participation.\nDefense counsel related that, according to defendant, out of the 300 inmates involved, 10\n\n                                             12.\n\fHispanics and 10 Blacks, of whom the guards were not very fond, were selected and\nplaced in SHU. Most recently, defendant had had 17 months of “spotless” behavior.\n       With respect to Terrell’s diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, defense\ncounsel pointed out Terrell noted, as did the actuarial information, that the disorder began\nto remit after the fourth decade of life, and defendant was about to enter his sixth decade.\nAccordingly, counsel asserted, there was no indication defendant would continue to\nbehave in an antisocial fashion. Defense counsel noted defendant had never hurt anyone.\nHe also represented that, because defendant had had an addiction to methamphetamine at\none point, defendant was willing to do an inpatient program to make sure it did not recur;\ndefendant was originally a truck driver and had the potential for employment through his\nbrother; and defendant was willing to continue an anger management program. Defense\ncounsel asked the court to accept defendant’s declarations and consider some form of\nsupervision for him, or, alternatively, to permit counsel to provide the actuarial\ndocuments to Terrell, the court, and the prosecutor, and to cross-examine Terrell on that\npoint. The final alternative defense counsel suggested was for the court to encourage\ndefendant to continue his violation-free behavior by returning defendant to prison for six\nmonths to a year, retaining jurisdiction, and, if defendant could “follow the Court’s view\nof probation in a sense, then … give him the benefit of the doubt and … consider\nreleasing him.”\n       The prosecutor objected to defense counsel testifying and submitting additional\ninformation, although he had no problem with counsel augmenting the record by bringing\nin someone if the court was willing to have that person testify. The prosecutor noted that\na risk assessment was “a broad-spectrum analysis of an individual and their propensity\nfor violence or recidivism,” which was the type of examination Terrell submitted. The\nprosecutor was against some level of supervision for defendant, because he did not\nbelieve someone who had a moderate to high risk of violence should be released in the\nfirst instance. As for the possibility of continuing the case and assessing defendant’s\n\n                                             13.\n\fconduct in the future, the prosecutor felt it might be appropriate in some cases, but not in\ndefendant’s situation because, as Terrell stated, defendant would need a period of several\nyears in order for anyone to feel confidence his level of risk was reduced.\n       The court informed defense counsel that it did not consider counsel’s statements to\nbe evidence. Defense counsel responded that if the prosecutor wanted “backing on that,”\ncounsel could put defendant on the stand to support everything counsel said regarding the\naftermath of the “alleged” riot, and counsel could also call Terrell to confirm what they\ndiscussed, that he did not make his decision based on any statistics, and that it essentially\nwas a psychiatric examination. Counsel observed that a lengthy period of violation-free\nbehavior was not available in this case, and he asked the court to consider the defense’s\nthree possibilities: allowing defense counsel to present further evidence, in which case\ncounsel would need a hearing date toward the end of June; supervision or programs;\nand/or retain jurisdiction while defendant did an additional period in prison with the\nwarning “sink or swim.”\n       The prosecutor asked to comment, but the court refused, saying it was ready to\nrule. It stated:\n\n              “I’ve considered both comments, I have gone through the reports.…\n       [F]rankly, some of the suggestions each of you make are suggestions that,\n       had those who created the statute thought ahead, would be very useful to\n       the Court in this circumstance.\n\n               “However, [defense counsel], … I am more than concerned. I have\n       reviewed, as I do in every single one of these cases, I look for options,\n       recognizing the impact of the Court’s ruling and the finality of the ruling.\n       If I can find an option that I believe is appropriate and will assure this court\n       that the individual is not a danger, I pursue it. I don’t see that option here.\n\n              “[Defendant], as recently as 2010, while it might appear minor, had\n       a face-to-face confrontation with the correctional officer where he stated —\n       and pardon my language, but I need to be direct on the record — ‘Fuck\n       you, get your punk ass away from the door.’\n\n\n\n\n                                             14.\n\f              “Prior to that, he was found in possession of a four-and-half-inch-\n       long sharpened instrument. And, it — if that type of behavior was a decade\n       ago — but it’s not, it’s within the past three to four years.\n\n            “I find at this point that [defendant] does pose a danger of risk to the\n       community, and for those reasons his request for … resentencing is denied.\n\n             “While I perhaps do not need to supplement the record, the fact is as\n       [defendant] left the courtroom, his physical demeanor towards the Court\n       appeared to be at least threatening, if not directly confrontational.”\n                                      DISCUSSION\n                                              I\n             THE STANDARD OF PROOF AND THE TRIAL COURT’S FINDING\n       Subdivision (f) of section 1170.126 provides that where, as here, an inmate\npetitioner is eligible for resentencing under the Act, he or she “shall be resentenced [as a\nsecond strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n       Defendant contends the prosecution failed to prove “unreasonable risk of danger\nto public safety,” which we will sometimes call “dangerousness,” beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, thereby violating the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. The applicable standard of proof, however, is preponderance\nof the evidence. (People v.

The ultimate determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger is a discretionary one. While the determination must be supported by facts\nestablished by a preponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of\ndanger by a preponderance of the evidence.

The situations noted by defendant in which such\na standard has been applied (see Conservatorship of Wendland (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2525487\"><a href=\"/opinion/2525487/conservatorship-of-wendland/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n546-548 & cases cited) are not analogous to the act of lenity contained in section\n1170.126.\n       We recognize that in the case of people who are involuntarily committed as\nnarcotics addicts or for analogous reasons, the California Supreme Court has found the\nappropriate standard of proof to be beyond a reasonable doubt.

Defendant received the protections of that\nstandard of proof (and the right to a jury trial) at the time he was found to have suffered\nhis prior strike convictions, however. (People v.

It is also apparent the court was convinced\nresentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. That\nit stated its finding unartfully does not mean it failed to make the requisite finding.\n\n\n\n\n8       The substantial evidence test applies to an appellate court’s review of findings\nmade under the preponderance of the evidence standard.

Under that test, the appellate court reviews the record in the\nlight most favorable to the challenged finding, to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nmake the finding by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court “resolve[s] all\nconflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility in favor of the [finding], and …\nindulge[s] every reasonable inference the [trier of fact] could draw from the evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       If a factor (for example, that the petitioner recently committed a battery, is violent\ndue to repeated instances of mutual combat, etc.) is not established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, it cannot form the basis for a finding of unreasonable risk.

During the court and\nparties’ discussion of defendant’s disciplinary record, both counsel made a number of\nreferences to guilty or adverse “findings.” For instance, with respect to the 115 based on\nparticipation in a riot, the prosecutor referred to a “guilty finding” that defendant was a\nparticipant. Defense counsel agreed a guilty finding was made, but disagreed the finding\nwas based on evidence in the records.\n\n\n\n\n9     This being the case, we need not decide whether, as asserted by the Attorney\nGeneral, defendant forfeited his claim by failing to raise it below.\n\n\n                                             19.\n\f       We fail to discern anything wrong with the parties’ references to the prison’s\n“findings.” Our reading of the record does not suggest the prosecutor was seeking to\nhave the court give preclusive effect to the prison’s findings, but rather he was arguing\ndefendant’s denials of wrongdoing and innocent explanations lacked credibility.\nWhatever the prosecutor’s intent, it is absolutely clear from the record that the court took\ndefendant’s explanations, claims of self-defense, and denials of wrongdoing fully into\naccount in reaching its decision, and did not give preclusive effect to prison findings.\n                                              IV\n                             REFUSAL OF DEFENSE EVIDENCE\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion or failed to exercise\ninformed discretion, denied defendant his right to a full and fair adversarial proceeding,\nand violated his right to due process, by its “refusal” of defense evidence of (1) actuarial\ndocuments and research, and (2) cross-examination of Terrell.

Terrell\nexamined defendant on May 17, 2013, and his report was dated May 19, 2013. The\nrecord contains no explanation why defense counsel did not speak to Terrell, and/or send\nhim the actuarial materials, before Terrell spoke with defendant or at least before he\nprepared his report, particularly in light of the fact Terrell had before him a letter from\ndefense counsel dated April 22, 2013, and the trial court had warned the hearing would\nnot be continued further. The record also contains no indication defense counsel\nattempted to subpoena Terrell, or otherwise obtain his presence, for the hearing with a\nview to cross-examining him on his report.\n       Significantly, defendant’s age and age’s effect on recidivism were before the court\nin Terrell’s report, albeit perhaps not to the extent defendant would have liked, and the\nprosecutor did not dispute that evidence. The bottom line was not what actuarial\nevidence would show, but what evidence concerning this defendant showed regarding his\nlikelihood of recidivism, particularly with respect to crimes of violence. The court\ndeclared itself “more than concerned” by incidents that occurred within the past three to\nfour years, and a fair reading of the record shows the court denied defendant’s petition for\nresentencing based in large part on those recent incidents. Under the circumstances,\ndefendant and his counsel did indeed “enjoy[] a full and fair opportunity to marshal and\npresent the case supporting a favorable exercise of discretion” (People v.

(Nov. 6, 2012) Prop. 36, pp. 48-53)\ndemonstrates the proper focus in a resentencing proceeding under the Act, as in parole\ncases, is on whether the petitioner currently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety. (Cf. In re Shaputis (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1241</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1254; In re Lawrence (2008)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1214.) There is a crucial distinction between resentencing proceedings\nunder the Act and parole cases, however. The parole board can find an inmate serving a\nlife term unsuitable for parole, but rehear the matter within a certain time to assess his or\nher behavior in prison, among other factors, to determine his or her dangerousness. The\nAct contains no such provision. Rather, it provides for a one-time determination of a\npetition filed within two years of the Act’s effective date.\n\n                                              24.\n\f       Construing the statutory language in the context of the statute as a whole and the\noverall statutory scheme, as we are required to do (People v. Rizo (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1316085\"><a href=\"/opinion/1316085/people-v-rizo/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n685), we find nothing that expressly or implicitly authorizes a court to continue or\notherwise hold in abeyance a petition for resentencing for the purpose of reexamining the\ninmate’s dangerousness. To the contrary, the Act’s limiting an inmate to the filing of a\nsingle petition for resentencing within two years of the Act’s effective date indicates an\nintent to resolve such petitions within a finite time period. The drafters of the Act could\nhave created a statutory scheme to allow the court to retain jurisdiction to reevaluate the\ndanger posed periodically or at some future time. They did not do so. Moreover, the\nvoter information guide states the Act will result in a one-time cost related to handling\nthe resentencing petitions, not periodic evaluations to review an inmate’s fitness for\nresentencing and possible release. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012),\nsupra, analysis of Prop. 36 by Legis. Analyst, p. 50.)12\n                                             VII\n                                      PROPOSITION 47\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\n\n\n\n\n12     Defendant points out that a petition for resentencing may be filed beyond the two-\nyear limitation upon a showing of good cause. (§ 1170.126, subd. (b).) This is true.\nThat a court has the power to find good cause to excuse a late petition does not mean,\nhowever, it has the power to defer a ruling in order to monitor subsequent conduct.\n\n\n                                              25.\n\fpetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).)13\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision the\nparties address in their supplemental briefs. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides:\n“As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists what are sometimes called “super strike”\noffenses.14\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\n\n\n\n13    Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n14     As set out in subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) of section 667, those felonies are: “(I) A\n‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 6600 of the Welfare\nand Institutions Code. [¶] (II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age,\nand who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 288a,\nsodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more than 10 years\nyounger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual penetration with another\nperson who is under 14 years of age, and who is more than 10 years younger than he or\nshe, as defined by Section 289. [¶] (III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under\n14 years of age, in violation of Section 288. [¶] (IV) Any homicide offense, including\nany attempted homicide offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive. [¶]\n(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f. [¶] (VI) Assault with a\nmachine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision\n(d) of Section 245. [¶] (VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418. [¶] (VIII) Any serious and/or violent\nfelony offense punishable in California by life imprisonment or death.”\n\n\n                                            26.\n\foffense.

Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the will of\nCalifornians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation be given\nprecedence in determining the appropriate punishment for crimes. Further, those goals\nwere best achieved by ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for\nsecond and third ‘strikes.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2247818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2247818/people-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 528-529.)\n       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., supra, text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\n\n16    This applies equally to the three strikes initiative measure that added section\n1170.12 to the Penal Code. (See Historical and Statutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann. Pen.\nCode (2015 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 376.)\n\n\n                                             29.\n\fNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\nresult is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory\nunder the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)),\nand that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an\narray of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2)).\n       Significantly, nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given\nany indication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. (See,\ne.g., Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.

In any event, “canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining\nprobable legislative intent” (Stone v. Superior Court (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1381592\"><a href=\"/opinion/1381592/stone-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 521, fn. 10);\nthey are “mere guides and will not be applied so as to defeat the underlying legislative\nintent otherwise determined [citation]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing\nCom., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1391).\n       The Act was intended to reform the three strikes law while keeping intact that\nscheme’s core commitment to public safety. Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Constraining that discretion so that all but the worst felony offenders are\nreleased manifestly does not, nor does it comport with voters’ intent in enacting either\nProposition 36 or Proposition 47.\n       Accordingly, Proposition 47 has no effect on defendant’s petition for resentencing\nunder the Act. Defendant is not entitled to a remand with directions to resentence him to\na second-strike term.17\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n17     Were we to conclude section 1170.18, subdivision (c) modifies section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), we would conclude it does not do so retroactively.
