See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\n                               OPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\n    Petitioner Darick Demorris Walker was convicted by a Virginia\nstate court jury of capital murder for the killings of Stanley Beale and\nClarence Threat, use of firearm in the commission of a felony, and\ntwo counts of burglary. He was sentenced to death on the capital mur-\nder count and to prison terms on the other counts. The Supreme Court\nof Virginia affirmed Walker's conviction and death sentence on direct\nappeal and denied Walker's petition for state habeas relief. The dis-\ntrict court dismissed Walker's federal habeas petition and declined to\ngrant a Certificate of Appealability (COA).\n\n    Walker now seeks a COA to bring an appeal of the district court's\ndismissal. Specifically, he asserts that he has made the required sub-\nstantial showing that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was vio-\nlated at the guilt phase of his trial when his counsel failed to challenge\nhis single trial for two murders, that his due process rights were vio-\nlated when the Commonwealth failed to timely disclose Brady materi-\nals, and that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated at the\nsentencing phase of his trial when his counsel failed to investigate and\npresent compelling mitigating evidence. Because reasonable jurists\ncould debate the district court's assessment of the first two of these\nclaims (the right to counsel at the guilt phase of trial claim and the\nBrady claim) we grant a COA as to these claims; however, upon\nreview of their merits, we affirm the district court's dismissal.\nBecause reasonable jurists could not debate the district court's assess-\n\n                                   2\n\fment of the right to counsel at the sentencing phase of his trial claim,\nwe deny a COA as to this claim and dismiss.\n\n                                   I.\n\n    Stanley Beale lived with Catherine Taylor and their children,\nMonique, Bianca, and Sidney, in the University Terrace Apartments.1\nOn November 22, 1996, Taylor was in the bedroom with Sidney, an\ninfant, when she heard \"a boom like noise\" coming from the living\nroom. As she entered the living room to investigate, she saw a man,\nwhom she identified as Walker, kick in the locked front door. Walker\nwas holding a gun and began yelling, \"Where is he?\" Walker then\nasked Beale, who was standing in the doorway of the kitchen, \"What\nyou keep coming up to my door, what you look for me for?\" Beale\nresponded that he did not know Walker and did not know where he\nlived. Bianca, who was 13 years old at the time, began to shout at\nWalker, telling him that her father did not know him. When Walker\nbegan shooting at Beale, Taylor took Bianca and Monique into the\nbathroom to hide. Beale was shot three times and died. Bianca testi-\nfied that she knew Walker as \"Todd\" and that she identified Walker\nin a photospread as the person who killed her father.\n\n   On the night of Beale's murder, Tameria Patterson, a fourteen-\nyear-old girl, was visiting a friend who lived in the University Terrace\nApartments. Patterson testified that she saw a man she knew as\n\"Todd\" enter her friend's apartment that night and say, \"I shot him.\"\nPatterson identified Walker in a photospread as the person who had\nentered the apartment and made the statement.\n\n   Approximately seven months later, on the night of June 18, 1997,\nClarence Threat and Andrea Noble were sleeping in their bedroom.\nThey were awakened by a \"pop\" coming from the screen door, which\nwas followed by a knock at the door. Noble went to the door and\nlooked outside through a small window in the door, but did not see\nanyone. Twice more she heard someone knocking but did not see any-\n____________________________________________________________\n   1\n     These facts are derived from the statement of facts in the Supreme\nCourt of Virginia's published opinion affirming Walker's conviction on\ndirect appeal. See Walker v. Commonwealth, 515 S.E.2d 565, 568-69\n(Va. 1999).\n\n                                   3\n\fone when she looked out the window. Sometime after the third knock,\nthe door was \"kicked open.\" Noble went to the living room to find a\nperson she knew as \"Paul\" standing there with a gun. \"Paul\" pointed\nthe gun at Noble, who backed into the bedroom. When they reached\nthe bedroom, \"Paul\" hit Noble with the back of the gun and then shot\nThreat in the leg. \"Paul\" and Threat \"exchanged words\" and then\n\"Paul\" shot Threat six more times. Threat died from a gunshot wound\nto the chest. \"Paul\" warned Noble that if she told anyone \"he would\ncome back and kill [her] and [her] kids.\" At trial, Noble identified\nWalker as the person she knew as \"Paul.\"\n\n    Walker was indicted on one count of capital murder for the killings\nof Beale and Threat within a three-year period in violation of Va.\nCode Ann. ยง 18.2-31.1(8) (Michie 1996), on four counts of the use of\na firearm in the commission of a felony in violation of Va. Code Ann.\nยง 18.2-53.1 (Michie 1996), and on two counts of burglary in violation\nof Va. Code Ann. ยง 18.2-90 (Michie 1996). On August 31 and Sep-\ntember 1, 1998, Walker was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court\nfor the City of Richmond and found guilty of all charges. He was sen-\ntenced to death for the capital murder conviction, life imprisonment\nfor each of the burglaries, and a total of 18 years imprisonment for\nthe firearms offenses.\n\n    On June 11, 1999, the Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed Walk-\ner's conviction and death sentence. Walker v. Commonwealth, 515\nS.E.2d 565 (Va. 1999). The Supreme Court of the United States\ndenied Walker's petition for a writ of certiorari on January 18, 2000.\nWalker v. Virginia, 528 U.S. 1125 (2000). On March 23, 2001, the\nSupreme Court of Virginia dismissed Walker's state petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus. The Supreme Court of the United States denied\nWalker's petition for a writ of certiorari on October 29, 2001. Walker\nv. True, 534 U.S. 1003 (2001).\n\n   On February 1, 2002, Walker filed a petition for a writ of habeas\ncorpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nVirginia. The district court dismissed Walker's petition on July 26,\n2002. On September 4, 2002, the district court denied Walker's\nMotion to Alter or Amend Judgment and declined to grant a Certifi-\ncate of Appealability (COA). Walker now seeks to appeal.\n\n                                  4\n\f                                   II.\n\n   To appeal the denial of habeas relief in the district court, a prisoner\nmust first obtain a COA. See 28 U.S.C.A. ยง 2253(c)(1) (West Supp.\n2002). The first opportunity to obtain a COA is in the district court.\nWhen \"an applicant files a notice of appeal, the district judge who\nrendered the judgment must either issue a certificate of appealability\nor state why a certificate should not issue.\" Fed. R. App. Pro.\n22(b)(1). In the present case, the district court denied Walker a COA.\nBecause the requirement for a COA is jurisdictional, we may not con-\nsider the merits of Walker's claims unless Walker has made the\nthreshold showing required to obtain a COA. Miller-El v. Cockrell,\n537 U.S. __, 123 S. Ct. 1029, 1039 (2003) (\"This threshold inquiry\ndoes not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases\nadduced in support of the claims. In fact, the statute forbids it.\"). Thus\nour COA determination requires an overview of Walker's claims and\na general assessment of their merits.2\n\n    To obtain a COA, a petitioner must make a \"substantial showing\nof the denial of a constitutional right.\" 28 U.S.C.A. ยง 2253(c)(2).\n\"Under the controlling standard, a petitioner must `sho[w] that rea-\nsonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that)\nthe petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that\nthe issues presented were \"adequate to deserve encouragement to pro-\nceed further.\"'\" Miller-El, 123 S. Ct. at 1039 (quoting Slack v.\nMcDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000), which in turn was quoting Bare-\nfoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 893 n.4 (1983)). \"A prisoner seeking a\n____________________________________________________________\n    2\n      We note that our consideration of Walker's COA application after the\nissues of this case have already been fully briefed and argued is proce-\ndurally misaligned with the appropriate standard for COA applications.\nSee Miller-El v. Cockrell, 123 S. Ct. 1029, 1040 (2003); Swisher v. True,\n__ F.3d __, No. 02-10, slip op. at 8 (4th Cir. March 28, 2003). Nonethe-\nless, because we address Walker's request under the standards set forth\nin Slack and Miller-El, our COA determination is not based on a full con-\nsideration of Walker's claims. Rather, we must grant a COA if, after a\nthreshold inquiry, reasonable jurists would find the district court's\nassessment of Walker's claims debatable or wrong, \"even though every\njurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been granted and the case\nhas received full consideration, that petitioner will not prevail.\" Miller-\nEl, 123 S. Ct. at 1040.\n\n                                   5\n\fCOA must prove something more than the absence of frivolity or the\nexistence of mere good faith on his or her part. We do not require\npetitioner to prove, before the issuance of a COA, that some jurists\nwould grant the petition for habeas corpus.\" Id. at 1040 (internal quo-\ntation marks and citation omitted). \"We look to the District Court's\napplication of AEDPA to petitioner's constitutional claims and ask\nwhether that resolution was debatable amongst jurists of reason.\" Id.\nat 1039. \"Where a district court has rejected [a petitioner's] constitu-\ntional claims on the merits, . . . [t]he petitioner must demonstrate that\nreasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the\nconstitutional claims debatable or wrong\" to obtain a COA. Slack,\n529 U.S. at 484. Further, \"[w]hen the district court denies a habeas\npetition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner's under-\nlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner\nshows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether\nthe petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\nand that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district\ncourt was correct in its procedural ruling.\" Id.\n\n   In his application for a COA, Walker raises three issues that were\naddressed by the district court. First, Walker argues that the state\ncourt's conclusion that his trial counsel did not render ineffective\nassistance by failing to challenge his single trial for two murders was\nan objectively unreasonable application of federal law. He argues that\nthe district court used an erroneous legal standard when it denied this\nclaim. A COA is issued on this claim because Judge Gregory finds\nthat reasonable jurists could debate whether the district court should\nhave resolved this claim differently.3 We address the merits of the\nclaim below.\n\n   Second, Walker asserts that the Commonwealth failed to disclose\nexculpatory materials in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n(1963). Walker challenges the state court's decision that a portion of\nhis Brady claim is procedurally defaulted and that the remainder is\nwithout merit. He argues that the district court erred by concluding\nthat he had not shown cause for the default and by concluding that the\n____________________________________________________________\n    3\n      Under 4th Cir. R. 22(a), \"if any judge of [a] panel is of the opinion\nthat the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a con-\nstitutional right, the certificate will issue.\"\n\n                                   6\n\fstate court's resolution of the remainder of his Brady claim was not\nan unreasonable application of federal law. A COA is also issued on\nthis claim because Judge Gregory finds that reasonable jurists could\ndebate whether the district court should have resolved this claim dif-\nferently. We address the merits of the claim below.\n\n    Third, Walker argues that the state court's conclusion that his trial\ncounsel did not render ineffective assistance during sentencing by\nfailing to investigate and present compelling mitigating evidence was\nan objectively unreasonable application of federal law. Specifically,\nWalker claims that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed\nto timely discover and effectively present school records and mental\nhealth history, failed to investigate and provide records to Dr. J.\nRandy Thomas of the Medical College of Virginia's Forensic Evalua-\ntion Program, Walker's court-appointed mental health expert, and\nfailed to discover Walker's brain dysfunction. The state court, apply-\ning the two-part test for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984)\n(\"[T]he defendant must show that counsel's performance was defi-\ncient . . . [and] that the deficient performance prejudiced the\ndefense.\"), concluded that Walker's claim failed to satisfy the perfor-\nmance prong. The state court determined that counsel's delay in\nacquiring Walker's school records resulted from Walker's and his\nmother's recalcitrance, and Walker presented no evidence to the dis-\ntrict court to rebut this conclusion. The state court also rejected Walk-\ner's claim that his counsel was ineffective by failing to further\ninvestigate Walker's organic brain damage and concluded that coun-\nsel's decision to use Walker's school records to demonstrate that\nWalker would respond well in a structured environment, rather than\narguing that Walker suffered from an organic mental deficiency, was\na reasonable trial strategy. The district court determined that the state\ncourt's decision was not an unreasonable application of Strickland\nbecause, as there is only one reference to possible organic brain dam-\nage in Walker's school records, Walker's counsel was justified in pur-\nsuing and preparing an alternative theory better supported by the\nevidence. Moreover, both the state court and district court determined\nthat counsel's choice not to forward Walker's school records to the\ncourt-appointed mental health expert was reasonable because after he\nhad diagnosed Walker as a sociopath, the mental health expert was\nremoved from the defense witness list. Our threshold review of Walk-\n\n                                   7\n\fer's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase\nof his trial reveals that reasonable jurists could not debate the district\ncourt's resolution of this claim. We therefore deny a COA on this\nclaim. We address below the two claims on which we have granted\na COA.\n\n                                   III.\n\n    Walker was convicted of \"[t]he willful, deliberate, and premedi-\ntated killing of more than one person within a three-year period.\" Va.\nCode Ann. ยง 18.2-31.1(8). He was tried in a single trial before a sin-\ngle jury. Walker asserts that his conviction is invalid because his trial\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to challenge the\nconstitutionality of ยง 18.2-31.1(8), move for separate trials on the two\nmurders, or request a jury instruction that evidence of one murder\ncould not be considered in determining Walker's guilt in the other.\n\n    As stated above, to show ineffective assistance of counsel \"the\ndefendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient . . .\n[and] that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\" Strick-\nland, 466 U.S. at 687. The state court held that Walker's claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel in the guilt phase satisfied neither the\nperformance prong nor the prejudice prong of the Strickland test.\nBecause the state court adjudicated this claim on the merits, we may\nnot grant habeas relief unless the state court's adjudication \"resulted\nin a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable appli-\ncation of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C.A. ยง 2254(d)(1) (West\nSupp. 2002). Walker asserts that he is entitled to federal habeas relief\nbecause the state court's decision was an unreasonable application of\nStrickland. (Appellant's Br. at 14.) \"`[U]nder the \"unreasonable appli-\ncation\" clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state\ncourt identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Court's\ndecision but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the\nprisoner's case.'\" Lockyer v. Andrade, 123 S. Ct. 1166, 1174 (2003)\n(citing Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 413 (2000)); see also Bell\nv. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1850 (2002). \"The `unreason-\nable application' clause requires the state court decision to be more\nthan incorrect or erroneous.\" Lockyer, 123 S. Ct. at 1174; see also\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 411 (\"[A] federal habeas court may not issue\n\n                                    8\n\fthe writ [under the unreasonable application clause] simply because\nthat court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant\nstate-court decision applied clearly established federal law errone-\nously or incorrectly.\"). Instead, \"[t]he state court's application of\nclearly established federal law must be objectively unreasonable.\"\nLockyer, 123 S. Ct. at 1174 (citation omitted). Walker, therefore,\n\"must do more than show that he would have satisfied Strickland's\ntest if his claim were being analyzed in the first instance.\" Bell, 122\nS.Ct. at 1852. Rather, he must demonstrate that the state court applied\nStrickland in \"an objectively unreasonable manner.\" Id. This he can-\nnot do. Because, as discussed below, the state court's conclusion that\nWalker could not satisfy the prejudice prong was not unreasonable,\nwe need not address the state court's determination under the perfor-\nmance prong of Strickland.\n\n   To establish prejudice, a defendant \"must show that there is a rea-\nsonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.\" Strickland, 466\nU.S. at 694. \"A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome.\" Id. It was not objectively\nunreasonable for the state court to conclude that there was no reason-\nable probability that a challenge to the constitutionality of ยง 18.2-\n31.1(8) would have produced a different result.\n\n    In Commonwealth v. Smith, 557 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Va. 2002), the\nSupreme Court of Virginia rejected a claim that a single trial under\nยง 18.2-31.1(8) constitutes a misjoinder of different offenses. The\ncourt explained that murders charged under ยง 18.2-31.1(8) are con-\nnected by the \"fact that the capital murder and the predicate murder\nor murders occur within a three-year period.\" Id. at 226. This \"con-\nnection [is] similar to the link the General Assembly has established\nbetween capital murders and predicate offenses in other subsections\nof Code ยง 18.2-31.\" Id. For example, Va. Code Ann. ยง 18.2-31(5)\n(Michie 1996) provides that \"[t]he willful, deliberate, and premedi-\ntated killing of any person in the commission of, or subsequent to,\nrape or attempted rape\" constitutes a capital murder offense. The\nSupreme Court of Virginia thus concluded in Smith that \"the Com-\nmonwealth may join two or more counts or charges of murder in a\nprosecution under Code ยง 18.2-31.1(8) despite the prejudice that may\nresult thereafter . . . [if] the murders shall have occurred within a three\n\n                                    9\n\fyear period.\" Id. at 227. Because the Supreme Court has never\naddressed whether it is a misjoinder to have a single trial for a capital\noffense involving the commission of two murders within a set period\nof time, the Smith decision does not contradict clearly established fed-\neral law.4 Walker, therefore, has failed to show that there is a reason-\nable probability that his challenge to ยง 18.2-31.1(8) would have been\nsuccessful.\n\n    It was also not objectively unreasonable for the state court to con-\nclude that there was no reasonable probability that moving for sepa-\nrate trials or requesting an additional jury instruction would have\nproduced a different result. Even assuming that the trial court would\nhave granted either motion, Walker has failed to establish prejudice.\nThe risk created by joinder is that a jury may confuse the evidence\nand return a conviction against a defendant on a charge on which it\nwould have acquitted if the evidence had been properly segregated.\nSee Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539 (1993) (explaining that\nthe risk of joining defendants is that the jury will consider evidence\nagainst a defendant that would not be admissible if a defendant were\ntried alone). To show prejudice, Walker must demonstrate that there\nis a reasonable probability that the jury confused evidence of the\npredicate murder and evidence of the capital murder. It is not enough\nto show that he might have had a better chance for acquittal if the\nguilt phase of his trial had been bifurcated. See id. at 540 (\"[I]t is well\nsettled that defendants are not entitled to severance merely because\nthey may have a better chance of acquittal in separate trials.\"). Of\ncourse, some of the risk posed by joinder can be cured with proper\ninstructions to the jury. Id. In this case, the risk of the jury confusing\nthe evidence was minimal. As the district court noted, \"the joint trial\nwas not unduly lengthy or complex and the evidence with respect to\neach murder was distinct and easily compartmentalized.\" (J.A. at\n____________________________________________________________\n    4\n      Under the precedent of the Supreme Court, a misjoinder \"rise[s] to the\nlevel of a constitutional violation only if it results in prejudice so great\nas to deny a defendant his Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial.\" United\nStates v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 446 n.8 (1986) (\"Improper joinder does not,\nin itself, violate the Constitution.\"). As described in the text, Walker has\nfailed to show that the single trial caused him any prejudice, and thus\neven if his single trial under ยง 18.2-31.1(8) constituted a misjoinder, he\ncould not show that it was a violation of the Constitution.\n\n                                  10\n\f965.) The transcript shows that in presenting its case against Walker,\nthe Commonwealth kept its evidence regarding each murder separate.\nFirst it presented its case regarding the Beale murder and then put on\nits evidence about the Threat murder. Paul Tuttle, the only witness to\ntestify about both murders, testified first about the Beale murder, was\nexcused, and then recalled during the Threat portion of the trial.\n\n   Moreover, the jury instructions made it clear that each murder was\na separate element that had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n         If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has\n         proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the above ele-\n         ments of the offense as charged, then you shall find the\n         defendant guilty of capital murder . . . . If you find from the\n         evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a rea-\n         sonable doubt that the defendant killed Clarence Threat, and\n         that the killing was willful, deliberate and premeditated, but\n         fail to find that the defendant killed Stanley Roger Beale,\n         then you shall find the defendant guilty of first degree mur-\n         der . . . . If you find from the evidence that the Common-\n         wealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n         defendant killed Stanley Roger Beale, and that the killing\n         was willful, deliberate and premeditated, but fail to find that\n         the defendant killed Clarence Threat, then you shall find the\n         defendant guilty of first degree murder . . . . Ladies and gen-\n         tleman of the jury, it's simple. If you believe he killed both\n         in a three year period that would meet the elements of capi-\n         tal murder. But, you might believe he killed one and not the\n         other and that would be first degree murder. That would be\n         a finding of not guilty as to one he is not guilty of.\n\n(J.A. at 157-58.) Because the evidence for each murder was easily\ndistinguishable and the jury was instructed to consider each murder\nseparately, it was reasonable for the state court to conclude that under\nStrickland, Walker suffered no prejudice from his counsel's failure to\nmove for separate trials or request an additional jury instruction.\nAccordingly, the state court's denial of relief on Walker's claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel at the guilt phase was not an unrea-\nsonable application of federal law.\n\n                                  11\n\f                                  IV.\n\n    Walker argues that the Commonwealth failed to disclose exculpa-\ntory evidence that would have impeached the trial testimony of three\nof its key witnesses: Bianca Taylor, Tameria Patterson, and Chris\nMiller. The state court concluded that Walker's Brady claim regard-\ning Bianca was procedurally barred and found Walker's Brady claims\nregarding Patterson and Miller without merit. (J.A. at 348-49.) We\nwill discuss the state court's application of the procedural bar and\ndetermination on the merits in turn.\n\n                                  A.\n\n    Bianca testified at trial that she saw the shooter enter the house,\nyell at her father, and then shoot her father. Walker contends that the\nCommonwealth suppressed the following evidence that indicates that\nBianca did not see the shooter: the Supplementary Offense Report of\nOfficer Ernst (J.A. at 537), Supplementary Offense Report of Detec-\ntive Mullins (J.A. at 489), handwritten notes of Detective Mullins\n(J.A. at 485), and statements made by Bianca and Catherine Taylor\nto Detective James Hickman (J.A. at 543A). The state court, applying\nthe rule in Slayton v. Parrigan, 205 S.E.2d 680 (Va. 1974), concluded\nthat because this issue \"could have been raised and adjudicated at\n[Walker's] trial and upon his appeal,\" Walker \"ha[s] no standing to\nattack his final judgment of conviction by habeas corpus.\" 205 S.E.2d\nat 682. The district court refused to address the merits of this claim,\nconcluding that this state procedural rule was independent and ade-\nquate and that Walker had failed to show cause and prejudice.\n\n    A federal court conducting habeas review is \"precluded from\nreviewing the merits of a claim that was procedurally defaulted under\nan `independent and adequate' state procedural rule, `unless the\n[applicant] can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice\nas a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that\nfailure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage\nof justice.'\" Fisher v. Lee, 215 F.3d 438, 455 (4th Cir. 2000) (alter-\nation in original) (quoting Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750\n(1991)). A state rule is \"adequate\" if it is regularly or consistently\napplied by the state court, see Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U.S. 578,\n587 (1988), and \"independent\" if it does not \"depend[ ] on a federal\n\n                                  12\n\fconstitutional ruling,\" Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 75 (1985)\n(alteration in original). \"We have repeatedly recognized that the pro-\ncedural default rule set forth in Slayton constitutes an adequate and\nindependent state law ground for decision.\" Fisher v. Angelone, 163\nF.3d 835, 844 (4th Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted) (cit-\ning cases). Walker does not dispute that the state court applied an ade-\nquate and independent procedural rule but rather asserts that he can\ndemonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the default.5\n\n    \"Cause excuses the failure to raise a claim during a state proceed-\ning if `the factual or legal basis for [the] claim was not reasonably\navailable.'\" Fisher, 163 F.3d 835, 845 (alteration in original) (quoting\nMcCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 494 (1991)). Walker contends that\nthe Commonwealth's interference, specifically its suppression of the\ndocuments listed above until eight months after direct appeal, pre-\nvented his counsel from raising the Brady claim regarding Bianca\nprior to state habeas. He correctly points out that \"a defendant cannot\nconduct a `reasonable and diligent investigation' [as] mandated by\nMcCleskey to preclude a finding of procedural default when the evi-\ndence is in the hands of the State.\" Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263,\n287-88 (1999). If Walker, however, was aware or should have been\naware that documents had been suppressed when he appealed his con-\nviction, suppression of the documents would not constitute cause for\nfailure to bring a Brady claim. Id. at 287 (holding that suppression of\ndocuments can constitute cause and distinguishing cases in which \"the\npetitioner was previously aware of the factual basis for his claim but\nfailed to raise it earlier\").\n\n    In applying the Slayton procedural bar, the state court found that\nat the time Walker filed for direct review, Walker's counsel was\naware of the factual basis of Walker's Brady claim, specifically, the\nCommonwealth's suppression of the evidence that allegedly could\nhave impeached Bianca's testimony. This factual finding is presumed\nto be correct and petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presump-\ntion of correctness by clear and convincing evidence. See 28 U.S.C.\nยง 2254(e)(1). Walker fails to satisfy this burden. Indeed, as Walker\nadmitted in the first habeas petition he presented to the district court,\n____________________________________________________________\n   5\n     Walker also does not argue that a fundamental miscarriage of justice\nwill occur if we do not consider his claim.\n\n                                  13\n\fshortly before trial the defense received a Presentence Report refer-\nencing two undisclosed police reports containing the same informa-\ntion as the documents listed above. This Presentence Report, by\nreferencing these undisclosed documents, evidenced the Common-\nwealth's suppression of the alleged Brady material.6 The factual basis\nfor the assertion of Walker's Brady claim, therefore, was available not\nonly before direct appeal, but before sentencing. Because Walker has\nfailed to rebut the state court's finding that he could have brought his\nclaim on direct review, he cannot demonstrate that the alleged with-\nholding by the Commonwealth constitutes cause to excuse his failure\nto raise the claim.7\n\n                                  B.\n\n   We now turn to the remainder of Walker's Brady claim regarding\nthe Commonwealth's alleged withholding of evidence that would\nhave impeached Patterson and Miller. Patterson testified at trial that\nsomeone she knew as \"Todd\" entered the residence of Karen and\nCharles Randolph and Jennifer Stewart, an apartment at 1309 W. Gra-\nham Road, on the night of Beale's murder and exclaimed, \"I shot\nhim.\" (J.A. at 50-52.) Miller testified that he observed an unidentified\nperson leave Beale's apartment after the shooting and enter the Ran-\n____________________________________________________________\n   6\n     In Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263 (1999), the Court explained that\nmere suspicion is not enough \"to impose a duty on counsel to advance\na claim for which they have no evidentiary support.\" Id. at 286. Because\nthe Presentence Report provided direct evidence that the Commonwealth\nhad failed to disclose the alleged Brady material, Walker's reliance on\nStrickler for the premise that his appellate counsel had no basis to raise\na Brady claim is therefore misplaced. Walker's counsel received evi-\ndence before trial that should have at least raised suspicion that the Com-\nmonwealth had the evidence Walker now claims was suppressed in\nviolation of Brady. Specifically, the Report of Autopsy, stated that \"[t]his\n36 year old male [Stanley Beale] was shot multiple times by an unknown\nassailant. . . . [Witnesses] heard the shots but did not witness the shoot-\ning.\" (J.A. at 541 (emphasis added).) However, we need not decide\nwhether the Report of Autopsy was sufficient to support the Brady claim\nWalker now asserts because the Presentence Report, containing direct\nevidence of the alleged Brady violation, undoubtedly was.\n   7\n     Because Walker has not shown cause for the default, we need not\nconsider his claim that he has established actual prejudice.\n\n                                  14\n\fdolph apartment. Walker contends that the Commonwealth sup-\npressed the following records that would have impeached the\ntestimony of Miller and Patterson: (1) a handwritten note by Detective\nMullins recording Karen Randolph's statement that \"Ty didn't come\ninto her apt. [1309 W. Graham Road] after the shooting\"8 (J.A. at\n486); (2) a statement to Detective Mullins by 1309 W. Graham Road\nresident Jennifer Stewart that she \"didn't see him [Todd] Friday eve-\nning\" (J.A. at 486); (3) the Commonwealth's witness synopsis sheet\nstating that Miller said he saw a black male \"walk from scene putting\nsomething in his pocket. Didn't see face can't ID. . . Walked to front\nof 1309 W. Graham Rd. didn't go in. Got into a red Ford Escort and\ndrove to Brook Rd.\" (J.A. at 483); (4) the Supplementary Offense\nReport of Detective Mullins summarizing Miller's account of what he\nwitnessed, with no mention of the perpetrator entering 1309 W. Gra-\nham Road (J.A. at 488-89); and (5) the Supplementary Offense\nReport of Officer Ernst summarizing Miller's account of what he wit-\nnessed, with no mention of the perpetrator entering 1309 W. Graham\nRoad (J.A. at 537).\n\n   The state court concluded that this portion of Walker's Brady claim\nwas without merit. Specifically, the state court concluded that \"no\nmaterial, exculpatory evidence was withheld.\" (J.A. at 348.) The state\ncourt reasoned that\n\n         [n]either Stewart nor Randolph testified at trial; a review of\n         the investigating officer's complete notes indicates that\n         Christopher Miller would not have been impeached since he\n         told the officer that he saw a person walk from the Taylor\n         apartment and enter the Randolph apartment. Randolph\n         would have placed Walker at the murder scene regardless of\n         whether she would have testified that he did or did not enter\n         her apartment, thereby destroying the exculpatory quality of\n         the evidence alleged by petitioner to have been withheld.\n\n(J.A. at 349.)\n____________________________________________________________\n    8\n      Randolph stated in an affidavit that she knew Walker as \"Ty.\" As\nstated above, Patterson knew Walker as \"Todd\" and Noble knew him as\n\"Paul.\"\n\n                                 15\n\f   Under the Brady rule, the prosecution is required \"to disclose evi-\ndence favorable to the accused that, if suppressed, would deprive the\ndefendant of a fair trial.\" United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 675\n(1985). \"[F]avorable evidence is material, and constitutional error\nresults from its suppression by the government,`if there is a reason-\nable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.'\" Kyles v.\nWhitley, 514 U.S. 419, 433-34 (1995) (quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at\n682). While a court initially considers the materiality of undisclosed\nevidence item by item, it must ultimately consider the cumulative\neffect of all suppressed evidence. Id. at 435 & 436 n.10.\n\n    First, Randolph's statements to Detective Mullins that \"Ty didn't\ncome into her [1309 W. Graham Road apartment] after the shooting\"\n(J.A. at 486) cannot be characterized as impeachment evidence\nbecause Randolph did not testify. Moreover, even if it were poten-\ntially exculpatory evidence, it would not fall under the Brady rule\nbecause Walker's defense counsel was aware before trial of the fact\nthat Randolph did not see Ty enter her apartment after the shooting.\nInformation known by the defense falls outside of the Brady rule. See,\ne.g., United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 103 (1976) (explaining that\nBrady applies in situations in which information is known to the pros-\necution but unknown to the defense).\n\n    Second, Stewart's statement to Detective Mullins that she \"didn't\nsee [Todd] Friday evening\" at 1309 W. Graham Road (J.A. at 486)\nalso cannot be characterized as impeachment evidence because Stew-\nart did not testify. Moreover, Stewart's statement is not favorable to\nWalker because it does not contradict Patterson's claim that she saw\nWalker enter the apartment. Patterson testified that she had been\nupstairs with Stewart and that she saw Walker as she was coming\ndown the stairs. Patterson did not say whether Stewart was coming\ndown the stairs with her and thus gave no indication that Stewart was\nalso in a position to see Walker.\n\n   Finally, Walker claims that the following three documents contra-\ndict Miller's testimony that the person Miller saw leave Beale's apart-\nment entered the Randolph apartment before driving away: the\nCommonwealth's witness synopsis sheet (J.A. at 483), the Supple-\nmentary Offense Report of Detective Mullins (J.A. at 488-89), and\n\n                                  16\n\fSupplementary Offense Report of Officer Ernst (J.A. at 537). The\nwitness synopsis sheet was created by the prosecution to summarize\nstatements by the witnesses. The statement recorded on the witness\nsynopsis sheet, that the person Miller observed the night of the shoot-\ning \"didn't go in\" 1309 W. Graham Road (J.A. at 483), contradicts\nMiller's testimony that the person he saw leave Beale's apartment\nentered the Randolph apartment before driving away. Even if Brady\nrequires a prosecutor to disclose work product,9 there is no indication\nthat Miller adopted or approved this statement. Cf. Goldberg v.\nUnited States, 425 U.S. 94, 98 & n.3 (1976) (explaining that a prose-\ncutor's work product must be produced under the Jencks Act if it con-\ntains a statement relating to the testimony of a government witness\nthat has been \"signed or otherwise adopted or approved\" by the gov-\nernment witness). Indeed, it is not even clear whether the prosecution\nrecorded these statements during an interview of Miller or was merely\nattempting to summarize another report, such as Detective Mullins's\nSupplementary Offense Report. Detective Mullins's report, created on\nDecember 16, 1996, contains no statement by Miller regarding\nwhether the person he saw entered Randolph's apartment before driv-\ning away. Detective Ernst's description of his meeting with Miller on\nthe day of the murder also does not indicate whether the person Miller\nsaw entered the Randolph's apartment. Miller's statements reflected\nin the Supplementary Offense Reports, therefore, do not contradict his\ntestimony at trial. Moreover, even if we assume that the Supplemen-\ntary Offense Reports and the witness synopsis sheet fall under the\nBrady rule and would have had some impeachment effect, the prose-\ncution would have been able to rehabilitate Miller with Officer Mul-\nlins's contemporaneous notes of his interview of Miller on the day of\nthe murder, which reflect that Miller made the following statements:\n\"Car parked on grass 1309 W. Graham Rd. he went inside 1309\nbefore he left.\" (J.A. at 860.) It was therefore not an unreasonable\napplication of federal law for the state court to conclude that the mate-\nrial allegedly withheld in violation of Brady was either not impeach-\nment evidence or the cumulative effect of any material that was\n____________________________________________________________\n   9\n     The Supreme Court has not decided whether Brady requires a prose-\ncutor to turn over his work product. See Goldberg v. United States, 425\nU.S. 94, 98 n.3 (1976) (leaving open the question of whether Brady com-\npels the prosecutor to produce notes not covered under the Jencks Act).\n\n                                17\n\fimpeachment evidence did not make a different result reasonably\nprobable.\n\n                                 V.\n\n    Walker also seeks to assert that his execution would violate the\nEighth Amendment under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S. Ct.\n2242, 2252 (2002) (holding that executing a mentally retarded indi-\nvidual violates the Eight Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual pun-\nishments), a claim he did not make in the district court and has not\npresented in state court. Because Walker's Atkins claim is \"a brand-\nnew, free-standing allegation of constitutional error in the underlying\ncriminal judgment,\" United States v. Winestock, __ F.3d __, No. 02-\n6304 (4th Cir. Apr. 25, 2003) (explaining how to identify a successive\napplication), we construe Walker's assertion of this claim as a motion\nfor authorization to file a successive habeas corpus application under\n28 U.S.C.A. ยง 2244(b) (West Supp. 2002). See Fischer v. United\nStates, 285 F.3d 596, 600 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"If the original [habeas]\npetition did not contain [a new rule of constitutional law as a] ground\nfor relief, then that ground has been waived on appeal, . . . and a pris-\noner's habeas options are thereafter limited by the special rules that\napply to second or successive collateral attacks.\"). But see Hill v.\nAnderson, 300 F.3d 679, 682 (6th Cir. 2002) (combining petitioner's\nAtkins claim, raised for the first time on appeal, with habeas petition\nat issue in appeal). A successive habeas petition is allowed under\nยง 2244(b)(2)(A) if \"the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional\nlaw, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme\nCourt, that was previously unavailable.\" Walker's claim satisfies\nthese requirements because the Court in Atkins announced a new rule\nof constitutional law that applies retroactively to cases on collateral\nreview. See Penry v. Lynaugh, 489 U.S. 288, 330 (1989) (concluding\nthat a holding that \"the Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of\nmentally retarded persons . . . would fall under the first exception to\n[Teague's] general rule of non-retroactivity and would be applicable\nto defendants on collateral review\"); accord Hill, 300 F.3d at 681.\nWe, therefore, grant Walker's motion and authorize the district court\nto consider Walker's successive habeas petition.10 The district court,\n____________________________________________________________\n    10\n       Because we need not consider the factual predicate of Walker's claim\nto address his motion for authorization to file a successive petition, we\ndeny Walker's Motion for Leave to File Declaration of Dr. Scott W.\nSautter as Supplemental Material.\n\n                                 18\n\fof course, on considering Walker's petition, is free to dismiss it with-\nout prejudice to afford the Commonwealth of Virginia the first oppor-\ntunity to assess Walker's Atkins claim. See, e.g., Bell v. Cockrell, 310\nF.3d 330, 332-33 (5th Cir. 2002) (\"[I]nferior federal courts have no\nuseful role to play until and unless following Atkins, a death sentence\nis reaffirmed or again imposed on [the petitioner] by the state courts.\n. . . [T]he state must be given the first opportunity to apply the\nSupreme Court's holding in order to insure consistency among state\ninstitutions and procedures and to adjust its prosecutorial strategy to\nthe hitherto unforeseen new rule.\"); Hill, 300 F.3d at 682 (\"The\nSupreme Court's decision to return Atkins's case to state courts sug-\ngests that we should return [petitioner's] Eighth Amendment retarda-\ntion claim to the state for further proceedings. . . . [The state] should\nhave the opportunity to develop its own procedures for determining\nwhether a particular claimant is retarded and ineligible for death.\").\nFollowing state review of Walker's Atkins claim, Walker would be\nfree to refile his second petition should the need arise.\n\n                                  VI.\n\n   In summary, we grant a COA as to Walker's claim that his Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel was violated at the guilt phase of his trial\nand his claim that his due process rights were violated when the Com-\nmonwealth failed to timely disclose Brady materials. Because we con-\nclude that the resolution of these issues by the Supreme Court of\nVirginia does not constitute an unreasonable application of clearly\nestablished federal law, we affirm the district court's dismissal of\nthese claims. We deny a COA and dismiss Walker's appeal with\nregard to his claim that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated at\nthe sentencing phase of his trial because reasonable jurists could not\ndebate the district court's resolution of that issue.\n\n                    DISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART\n\n                                  19\n\f",

See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\n                               OPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\n    Petitioner Darick Demorris Walker was convicted by a Virginia\nstate court jury of capital murder for the killings of Stanley Beale and\nClarence Threat, use of firearm in the commission of a felony, and\ntwo counts of burglary. He was sentenced to death on the capital mur-\nder count and to prison terms on the other counts. The Supreme Court\nof Virginia affirmed Walker's conviction and death sentence on direct\nappeal and denied Walker's petition for state habeas relief. The dis-\ntrict court dismissed Walker's federal habeas petition and declined to\ngrant a Certificate of Appealability (COA).\n\n    Walker now seeks a COA to bring an appeal of the district court's\ndismissal.

As she entered the living room to investigate, she saw a man,\nwhom she identified as Walker, kick in the locked front door. Walker\nwas holding a gun and began yelling, \"Where is he?\" Walker then\nasked Beale, who was standing in the doorway of the kitchen, \"What\nyou keep coming up to my door, what you look for me for?\" Beale\nresponded that he did not know Walker and did not know where he\nlived. Bianca, who was 13 years old at the time, began to shout at\nWalker, telling him that her father did not know him. When Walker\nbegan shooting at Beale, Taylor took Bianca and Monique into the\nbathroom to hide. Beale was shot three times and died. Bianca testi-\nfied that she knew Walker as \"Todd\" and that she identified Walker\nin a photospread as the person who killed her father.\n\n   On the night of Beale's murder, Tameria Patterson, a fourteen-\nyear-old girl, was visiting a friend who lived in the University Terrace\nApartments.

First, Walker argues that the state\ncourt's conclusion that his trial counsel did not render ineffective\nassistance by failing to challenge his single trial for two murders was\nan objectively unreasonable application of federal law. He argues that\nthe district court used an erroneous legal standard when it denied this\nclaim. A COA is issued on this claim because Judge Gregory finds\nthat reasonable jurists could debate whether the district court should\nhave resolved this claim differently.3 We address the merits of the\nclaim below.\n\n   Second, Walker asserts that the Commonwealth failed to disclose\nexculpatory materials in violation of Brady v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1963). Walker challenges the state court's decision that a portion of\nhis Brady claim is procedurally defaulted and that the remainder is\nwithout merit. He argues that the district court erred by concluding\nthat he had not shown cause for the default and by concluding that the\n____________________________________________________________\n    3\n      Under 4th Cir.

A COA is also issued on\nthis claim because Judge Gregory finds that reasonable jurists could\ndebate whether the district court should have resolved this claim dif-\nferently. We address the merits of the claim below.\n\n    Third, Walker argues that the state court's conclusion that his trial\ncounsel did not render ineffective assistance during sentencing by\nfailing to investigate and present compelling mitigating evidence was\nan objectively unreasonable application of federal law. Specifically,\nWalker claims that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed\nto timely discover and effectively present school records and mental\nhealth history, failed to investigate and provide records to Dr. J.\nRandy Thomas of the Medical College of Virginia's Forensic Evalua-\ntion Program, Walker's court-appointed mental health expert, and\nfailed to discover Walker's brain dysfunction. The state court, apply-\ning the two-part test for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, see Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (1984)\n(\"[T]he defendant must show that counsel's performance was defi-\ncient . . . [and] that the deficient performance prejudiced the\ndefense.\"), concluded that Walker's claim failed to satisfy the perfor-\nmance prong. The state court determined that counsel's delay in\nacquiring Walker's school records resulted from Walker's and his\nmother's recalcitrance, and Walker presented no evidence to the dis-\ntrict court to rebut this conclusion. The state court also rejected Walk-\ner's claim that his counsel was ineffective by failing to further\ninvestigate Walker's organic brain damage and concluded that coun-\nsel's decision to use Walker's school records to demonstrate that\nWalker would respond well in a structured environment, rather than\narguing that Walker suffered from an organic mental deficiency, was\na reasonable trial strategy. The district court determined that the state\ncourt's decision was not an unreasonable application of Strickland\nbecause, as there is only one reference to possible organic brain dam-\nage in Walker's school records, Walker's counsel was justified in pur-\nsuing and preparing an alternative theory better supported by the\nevidence. Moreover, both the state court and district court determined\nthat counsel's choice not to forward Walker's school records to the\ncourt-appointed mental health expert was reasonable because after he\nhad diagnosed Walker as a sociopath, the mental health expert was\nremoved from the defense witness list. Our threshold review of Walk-\n\n                                   7\n\fer's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase\nof his trial reveals that reasonable jurists could not debate the district\ncourt's resolution of this claim. We therefore deny a COA on this\nclaim. We address below the two claims on which we have granted\na COA.\n\n                                   III.\n\n    Walker was convicted of \"[t]he willful, deliberate, and premedi-\ntated killing of more than one person within a three-year period.\" Va.\nCode Ann. ยง 18.2-31.1(8). He was tried in a single trial before a sin-\ngle jury. Walker asserts that his conviction is invalid because his trial\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to challenge the\nconstitutionality of ยง 18.2-31.1(8), move for separate trials on the two\nmurders, or request a jury instruction that evidence of one murder\ncould not be considered in determining Walker's guilt in the other.\n\n    As stated above, to show ineffective assistance of counsel \"the\ndefendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient . . .\n[and] that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\" Strick-\nland, 466 U.S. at 687. The state court held that Walker's claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel in the guilt phase satisfied neither the\nperformance prong nor the prejudice prong of the Strickland test.\nBecause the state court adjudicated this claim on the merits, we may\nnot grant habeas relief unless the state court's adjudication \"resulted\nin a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable appli-\ncation of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C.A. ยง 2254(d)(1) (West\nSupp. 2002). Walker asserts that he is entitled to federal habeas relief\nbecause the state court's decision was an unreasonable application of\nStrickland. (Appellant's Br. at 14.) \"`[U]nder the \"unreasonable appli-\ncation\" clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state\ncourt identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Court's\ndecision but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the\nprisoner's case.'\" Lockyer v.

Instead, \"[t]he state court's application of\nclearly established federal law must be objectively unreasonable.\"\nLockyer, 123 S. Ct. at 1174 (citation omitted). Walker, therefore,\n\"must do more than show that he would have satisfied Strickland's\ntest if his claim were being analyzed in the first instance.\" Bell, 122\nS.Ct. at 1852. Rather, he must demonstrate that the state court applied\nStrickland in \"an objectively unreasonable manner.\" Id. This he can-\nnot do. Because, as discussed below, the state court's conclusion that\nWalker could not satisfy the prejudice prong was not unreasonable,\nwe need not address the state court's determination under the perfor-\nmance prong of Strickland.\n\n   To establish prejudice, a defendant \"must show that there is a rea-\nsonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.\" Strickland, 466\nU.S. at 694. \"A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome.\" Id. It was not objectively\nunreasonable for the state court to conclude that there was no reason-\nable probability that a challenge to the constitutionality of ยง 18.2-\n31.1(8) would have produced a different result.\n\n    In Commonwealth v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1059394\"><a href=\"/opinion/1059394/com-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226 (Va. 2002), the\nSupreme Court of Virginia rejected a claim that a single trial under\nยง 18.2-31.1(8) constitutes a misjoinder of different offenses. The\ncourt explained that murders charged under ยง 18.2-31.1(8) are con-\nnected by the \"fact that the capital murder and the predicate murder\nor murders occur within a three-year period.\" Id. at 226. This \"con-\nnection [is] similar to the link the General Assembly has established\nbetween capital murders and predicate offenses in other subsections\nof Code ยง 18.2-31.\" Id. For example, Va. Code Ann. ยง 18.2-31(5)\n(Michie 1996) provides that \"[t]he willful, deliberate, and premedi-\ntated killing of any person in the commission of, or subsequent to,\nrape or attempted rape\" constitutes a capital murder offense. The\nSupreme Court of Virginia thus concluded in Smith that \"the Com-\nmonwealth may join two or more counts or charges of murder in a\nprosecution under Code ยง 18.2-31.1(8) despite the prejudice that may\nresult thereafter . . . [if] the murders shall have occurred within a three\n\n                                    9\n\fyear period.\" Id. at 227. Because the Supreme Court has never\naddressed whether it is a misjoinder to have a single trial for a capital\noffense involving the commission of two murders within a set period\nof time, the Smith decision does not contradict clearly established fed-\neral law.4 Walker, therefore, has failed to show that there is a reason-\nable probability that his challenge to ยง 18.2-31.1(8) would have been\nsuccessful.\n\n    It was also not objectively unreasonable for the state court to con-\nclude that there was no reasonable probability that moving for sepa-\nrate trials or requesting an additional jury instruction would have\nproduced a different result. Even assuming that the trial court would\nhave granted either motion, Walker has failed to establish prejudice.\nThe risk created by joinder is that a jury may confuse the evidence\nand return a conviction against a defendant on a charge on which it\nwould have acquitted if the evidence had been properly segregated.\nSee Zafiro v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112812\"><a href=\"/opinion/112812/zafiro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 539 (1993) (explaining that\nthe risk of joining defendants is that the jury will consider evidence\nagainst a defendant that would not be admissible if a defendant were\ntried alone). To show prejudice, Walker must demonstrate that there\nis a reasonable probability that the jury confused evidence of the\npredicate murder and evidence of the capital murder. It is not enough\nto show that he might have had a better chance for acquittal if the\nguilt phase of his trial had been bifurcated. See id. at 540 (\"[I]t is well\nsettled that defendants are not entitled to severance merely because\nthey may have a better chance of acquittal in separate trials.\"). Of\ncourse, some of the risk posed by joinder can be cured with proper\ninstructions to the jury. Id. In this case, the risk of the jury confusing\nthe evidence was minimal. As the district court noted, \"the joint trial\nwas not unduly lengthy or complex and the evidence with respect to\neach murder was distinct and easily compartmentalized.\" (J.A. at\n____________________________________________________________\n    4\n      Under the precedent of the Supreme Court, a misjoinder \"rise[s] to the\nlevel of a constitutional violation only if it results in prejudice so great\nas to deny a defendant his Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial.\" United\nStates v.

The transcript shows that in presenting its case against Walker,\nthe Commonwealth kept its evidence regarding each murder separate.\nFirst it presented its case regarding the Beale murder and then put on\nits evidence about the Threat murder. Paul Tuttle, the only witness to\ntestify about both murders, testified first about the Beale murder, was\nexcused, and then recalled during the Threat portion of the trial.\n\n   Moreover, the jury instructions made it clear that each murder was\na separate element that had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n         If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has\n         proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the above ele-\n         ments of the offense as charged, then you shall find the\n         defendant guilty of capital murder . . . .

Because the evidence for each murder was easily\ndistinguishable and the jury was instructed to consider each murder\nseparately, it was reasonable for the state court to conclude that under\nStrickland, Walker suffered no prejudice from his counsel's failure to\nmove for separate trials or request an additional jury instruction.\nAccordingly, the state court's denial of relief on Walker's claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel at the guilt phase was not an unrea-\nsonable application of federal law.\n\n                                  11\n\f                                  IV.\n\n    Walker argues that the Commonwealth failed to disclose exculpa-\ntory evidence that would have impeached the trial testimony of three\nof its key witnesses: Bianca Taylor, Tameria Patterson, and Chris\nMiller. The state court concluded that Walker's Brady claim regard-\ning Bianca was procedurally barred and found Walker's Brady claims\nregarding Patterson and Miller without merit. (J.A. at 348-49.) We\nwill discuss the state court's application of the procedural bar and\ndetermination on the merits in turn.\n\n                                  A.\n\n    Bianca testified at trial that she saw the shooter enter the house,\nyell at her father, and then shoot her father. Walker contends that the\nCommonwealth suppressed the following evidence that indicates that\nBianca did not see the shooter: the Supplementary Offense Report of\nOfficer Ernst (J.A. at 537), Supplementary Offense Report of Detec-\ntive Mullins (J.A. at 489), handwritten notes of Detective Mullins\n(J.A. at 485), and statements made by Bianca and Catherine Taylor\nto Detective James Hickman (J.A. at 543A).

Id. at 287 (holding that suppression of\ndocuments can constitute cause and distinguishing cases in which \"the\npetitioner was previously aware of the factual basis for his claim but\nfailed to raise it earlier\").\n\n    In applying the Slayton procedural bar, the state court found that\nat the time Walker filed for direct review, Walker's counsel was\naware of the factual basis of Walker's Brady claim, specifically, the\nCommonwealth's suppression of the evidence that allegedly could\nhave impeached Bianca's testimony. This factual finding is presumed\nto be correct and petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presump-\ntion of correctness by clear and convincing evidence. See 28 U.S.C.\nยง 2254(e)(1). Walker fails to satisfy this burden. Indeed, as Walker\nadmitted in the first habeas petition he presented to the district court,\n____________________________________________________________\n   5\n     Walker also does not argue that a fundamental miscarriage of justice\nwill occur if we do not consider his claim.\n\n                                  13\n\fshortly before trial the defense received a Presentence Report refer-\nencing two undisclosed police reports containing the same informa-\ntion as the documents listed above. This Presentence Report, by\nreferencing these undisclosed documents, evidenced the Common-\nwealth's suppression of the alleged Brady material.6 The factual basis\nfor the assertion of Walker's Brady claim, therefore, was available not\nonly before direct appeal, but before sentencing. Because Walker has\nfailed to rebut the state court's finding that he could have brought his\nclaim on direct review, he cannot demonstrate that the alleged with-\nholding by the Commonwealth constitutes cause to excuse his failure\nto raise the claim.7\n\n                                  B.\n\n   We now turn to the remainder of Walker's Brady claim regarding\nthe Commonwealth's alleged withholding of evidence that would\nhave impeached Patterson and Miller. Patterson testified at trial that\nsomeone she knew as \"Todd\" entered the residence of Karen and\nCharles Randolph and Jennifer Stewart, an apartment at 1309 W. Gra-\nham Road, on the night of Beale's murder and exclaimed, \"I shot\nhim.\" (J.A. at 50-52.)

Greene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999), the Court explained that\nmere suspicion is not enough \"to impose a duty on counsel to advance\na claim for which they have no evidentiary support.\" Id. at 286. Because\nthe Presentence Report provided direct evidence that the Commonwealth\nhad failed to disclose the alleged Brady material, Walker's reliance on\nStrickler for the premise that his appellate counsel had no basis to raise\na Brady claim is therefore misplaced. Walker's counsel received evi-\ndence before trial that should have at least raised suspicion that the Com-\nmonwealth had the evidence Walker now claims was suppressed in\nviolation of Brady. Specifically, the Report of Autopsy, stated that \"[t]his\n36 year old male [Stanley Beale] was shot multiple times by an unknown\nassailant. . . . [Witnesses] heard the shots but did not witness the shoot-\ning.\" (J.A. at 541 (emphasis added).) However, we need not decide\nwhether the Report of Autopsy was sufficient to support the Brady claim\nWalker now asserts because the Presentence Report, containing direct\nevidence of the alleged Brady violation, undoubtedly was.\n   7\n     Because Walker has not shown cause for the default, we need not\nconsider his claim that he has established actual prejudice.\n\n                                  14\n\fdolph apartment. Walker contends that the Commonwealth sup-\npressed the following records that would have impeached the\ntestimony of Miller and Patterson: (1) a handwritten note by Detective\nMullins recording Karen Randolph's statement that \"Ty didn't come\ninto her apt. [1309 W. Graham Road] after the shooting\"8 (J.A. at\n486); (2) a statement to Detective Mullins by 1309 W. Graham Road\nresident Jennifer Stewart that she \"didn't see him [Todd] Friday eve-\nning\" (J.A. at 486); (3) the Commonwealth's witness synopsis sheet\nstating that Miller said he saw a black male \"walk from scene putting\nsomething in his pocket. Didn't see face can't ID. . . Walked to front\nof 1309 W. Graham Rd. didn't go in. Got into a red Ford Escort and\ndrove to Brook Rd.\" (J.A. at 483); (4) the Supplementary Offense\nReport of Detective Mullins summarizing Miller's account of what he\nwitnessed, with no mention of the perpetrator entering 1309 W. Gra-\nham Road (J.A. at 488-89); and (5) the Supplementary Offense\nReport of Officer Ernst summarizing Miller's account of what he wit-\nnessed, with no mention of the perpetrator entering 1309 W. Graham\nRoad (J.A. at 537).\n\n   The state court concluded that this portion of Walker's Brady claim\nwas without merit. Specifically, the state court concluded that \"no\nmaterial, exculpatory evidence was withheld.\" (J.A. at 348.) The state\ncourt reasoned that\n\n         [n]either Stewart nor Randolph testified at trial; a review of\n         the investigating officer's complete notes indicates that\n         Christopher Miller would not have been impeached since he\n         told the officer that he saw a person walk from the Taylor\n         apartment and enter the Randolph apartment. Randolph\n         would have placed Walker at the murder scene regardless of\n         whether she would have testified that he did or did not enter\n         her apartment, thereby destroying the exculpatory quality of\n         the evidence alleged by petitioner to have been withheld.\n\n(J.A. at 349.)\n____________________________________________________________\n    8\n      Randolph stated in an affidavit that she knew Walker as \"Ty.\" As\nstated above, Patterson knew Walker as \"Todd\" and Noble knew him as\n\"Paul.\"\n\n                                 15\n\f   Under the Brady rule, the prosecution is required \"to disclose evi-\ndence favorable to the accused that, if suppressed, would deprive the\ndefendant of a fair trial.\" United States v.

While a court initially considers the materiality of undisclosed\nevidence item by item, it must ultimately consider the cumulative\neffect of all suppressed evidence. Id. at 435 & 436 n.10.\n\n    First, Randolph's statements to Detective Mullins that \"Ty didn't\ncome into her [1309 W. Graham Road apartment] after the shooting\"\n(J.A. at 486) cannot be characterized as impeachment evidence\nbecause Randolph did not testify. Moreover, even if it were poten-\ntially exculpatory evidence, it would not fall under the Brady rule\nbecause Walker's defense counsel was aware before trial of the fact\nthat Randolph did not see Ty enter her apartment after the shooting.\nInformation known by the defense falls outside of the Brady rule. See,\ne.g., United States v. Agurs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109506\"><a href=\"/opinion/109506/united-states-v-agurs/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (1976) (explaining that\nBrady applies in situations in which information is known to the pros-\necution but unknown to the defense).\n\n    Second, Stewart's statement to Detective Mullins that she \"didn't\nsee [Todd] Friday evening\" at 1309 W. Graham Road (J.A. at 486)\nalso cannot be characterized as impeachment evidence because Stew-\nart did not testify. Moreover, Stewart's statement is not favorable to\nWalker because it does not contradict Patterson's claim that she saw\nWalker enter the apartment. Patterson testified that she had been\nupstairs with Stewart and that she saw Walker as she was coming\ndown the stairs. Patterson did not say whether Stewart was coming\ndown the stairs with her and thus gave no indication that Stewart was\nalso in a position to see Walker.\n\n   Finally, Walker claims that the following three documents contra-\ndict Miller's testimony that the person Miller saw leave Beale's apart-\nment entered the Randolph apartment before driving away: the\nCommonwealth's witness synopsis sheet (J.A. at 483), the Supple-\nmentary Offense Report of Detective Mullins (J.A. at 488-89), and\n\n                                  16\n\fSupplementary Offense Report of Officer Ernst (J.A. at 537). The\nwitness synopsis sheet was created by the prosecution to summarize\nstatements by the witnesses. The statement recorded on the witness\nsynopsis sheet, that the person Miller observed the night of the shoot-\ning \"didn't go in\" 1309 W. Graham Road (J.A. at 483), contradicts\nMiller's testimony that the person he saw leave Beale's apartment\nentered the Randolph apartment before driving away. Even if Brady\nrequires a prosecutor to disclose work product,9 there is no indication\nthat Miller adopted or approved this statement. Cf. Goldberg v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109417\"><a href=\"/opinion/109417/goldberg-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98 & n.3 (1976) (explaining that a prose-\ncutor's work product must be produced under the Jencks Act if it con-\ntains a statement relating to the testimony of a government witness\nthat has been \"signed or otherwise adopted or approved\" by the gov-\nernment witness). Indeed, it is not even clear whether the prosecution\nrecorded these statements during an interview of Miller or was merely\nattempting to summarize another report, such as Detective Mullins's\nSupplementary Offense Report. Detective Mullins's report, created on\nDecember 16, 1996, contains no statement by Miller regarding\nwhether the person he saw entered Randolph's apartment before driv-\ning away. Detective Ernst's description of his meeting with Miller on\nthe day of the murder also does not indicate whether the person Miller\nsaw entered the Randolph's apartment. Miller's statements reflected\nin the Supplementary Offense Reports, therefore, do not contradict his\ntestimony at trial. Moreover, even if we assume that the Supplemen-\ntary Offense Reports and the witness synopsis sheet fall under the\nBrady rule and would have had some impeachment effect, the prose-\ncution would have been able to rehabilitate Miller with Officer Mul-\nlins's contemporaneous notes of his interview of Miller on the day of\nthe murder, which reflect that Miller made the following statements:\n\"Car parked on grass 1309 W. Graham Rd. he went inside 1309\nbefore he left.\" (J.A. at 860.) It was therefore not an unreasonable\napplication of federal law for the state court to conclude that the mate-\nrial allegedly withheld in violation of Brady was either not impeach-\nment evidence or the cumulative effect of any material that was\n____________________________________________________________\n   9\n     The Supreme Court has not decided whether Brady requires a prose-\ncutor to turn over his work product.
