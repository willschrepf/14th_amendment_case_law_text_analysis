D-1-DC-12-201718\n\nTO THE HONORABLE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS:\n\n      Now comes the State of Texas and files its brief in response to that of the\n\nappellant.\n\n\n                         STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n\n      The State indicted appellant for the capital murder of Austin Police Officer\n\nJaime Padron. (CR 98, 100). The jury found appellant guilty of capital murder as\n\nalleged in the indictment. (CR 184). The trial court sentenced appellant to death\n\nbased on the jury’s answers to the punishment issues. (CR 189; RR 26: 221).\n\nAppellant timely filed a motion for new trial, which was overruled by operation of\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\flaw. (CR 196). Although appeal to this Court is automatic, the appellant timely\n\nfiled notice of appeal. (CR 197). Art. 37.071(h), V.A.C.C.P.\n\n\n                  STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n         The issues presented in this case are not issues of first impression but\n\ninvolve the application of facts to well-settled law. Thus, the State does not\n\nrequest oral argument in this case, as it would not significantly aid the Court in the\n\nresolution of the issues presented in this appeal.\n\n\n               STATEMENT OF FACTS FROM GUILT/INNOCENCE\n\nFacts\t\r  of\t\r  this\t\r  Capital\t\r  Murder\t\r  Committed\t\r  at\t\r  an\t\r  Austin\t\r  Walmart\t\r  \n\n         In the early hours1 of April 6, 2012, Walmart employee Sean McCarthy\n\nencountered appellant2 while restocking water in the store. (RR 18: 21). Appellant\n\nasked McCarthy to hold his produce bags, and appellant left the store to obtain\n\nsomething. (RR 18: 22-24). Appellant looked “like he had a rough night,” but\n\nMcCarthy did not feel threatened by him. (RR 18: 23). Walmart retail manager\n\nLincoln LeMere called 3113 because appellant appeared intoxicated, and LeMere\n\nfeared he would be a danger to himself and others. (RR 18: 54).\n\n\n\n1\n    The time was approximately midnight to 1 a.m. (RR 18: 24).\n2\n    McCarthy identified appellant in the courtroom. (RR 18: 32-34).\n3\n    The call was transferred to 911. (RR 18: 54).\n\n\n                                                    6\n\f       Austin Police Officer Jaime Padron responded to the call, and he and\n\nLeMere entered the store and encountered appellant. (RR 18: 58-59, 177, 179).\n\nOfficer Padron announced that he was with the Austin Police Department and told\n\nappellant to stop. (RR 18: 59-60, 132). Appellant lowered his shoulder, ducked\n\naway from Officer Padron, and ran for the exit. (RR 18: 59). Officer Padron gave\n\nchase and tackled appellant from behind. (RR 18: 60). Walmart employee Monica\n\nLawson saw appellant pull a gun from his waistband as Officer Padron attempted\n\nto subdue appellant and take his gun. (RR 18: 95-96). As Officer Padron tackled\n\nappellant, LeMere heard a gunshot, and he heard an additional gunshot when\n\nappellant and Officer Padron fell to the ground. (RR 18: 60-61, 63). Lawson’s co-\n\nworker, Alma Ramirez, testified that she saw appellant put the gun to Officer\n\nPadron’s neck and shoot him. (RR 18: 119-120).\n\n       LeMere realized appellant had a gun when he saw Officer Padron “bleeding\n\nout.” (RR 18: 61). LeMere immediately jumped on appellant who raised his arm\n\nand fired a third shot, which just missed LeMere’s right ear and night manager\n\nArchie Jordy’s left ear.4 (RR 18: 61, 133-134). LeMere felt that that third shot\n\nwas meant for him. (RR 18: 62).\n\n\n\n\n4\n Jordy had followed appellant through the store because he suspected he was going to shoplift,\nbut appellant did not appear armed. (RR 18: 56, 129, 153).\n\n\n                                               7\n\f       LeMere pushed appellant’s arm to the ground, and McCarthy and Jordy\n\nstomped on appellant’s arm, making him release the gun, and kicked the gun aside.\n\n(RR 18: 62). Appellant raised his head from the floor, looked at Officer Padron,\n\n“kind of laughed, chuckled and said, I killed a cop.” (RR 18: 64, 151). Officer\n\nPadron never pulled a weapon of any kind when chasing appellant. (RR 18: 98).\n\n       It was obvious to the various Walmart employees5 that Padron was a police\n\nofficer because of his uniform, “all the gadgets,” and his apparent fitness. (RR 18:\n\n38). Officer Padron was wearing a full Austin Police Department uniform. (RR\n\n18: 38, 56). Officer Padron had not removed his gun from his gun belt. (RR 18:\n\n64). The security hood on Officer Padron’s holster was still in the locked position\n\nwith his gun inside the holster. (RR 18: 204-205).\n\n       Walmart employees tried to keep Officer Padron alive while police arrived\n\nat the scene and handcuffed appellant. (RR 18: 35). Will Garlow removed his\n\nshirt and applied pressure to Officer Padron’s neck until the squirting blood\n\nstopped. (RR 18: 166-167). Garlow talked to Officer Padron and attempted to\n\nkeep him awake. But, Officer Padron never responded verbally, and he barely\n\nfocused his eyes. (RR 18: 166, 167-168). Garlow and Austin police officer Chris\n\nKroger attempted to clear Officer Padron’s airway, but it was too late, as Officer\n5\n  Walmart employees Monica Lawson, Alma Ramirez, and William Garlow all immediately\nrecognized that Officer Padron was a police officer because of his uniform and badge. (RR 18:\n94, 118-119, 162). Austin police officer Steve Martinez was in full uniform during trial and\ndisplayed it for the jury since Officer Padron had worn the same type uniform. (RR 18: 217).\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fPadron had bled out. (RR 18: 167, 181). EMS pronounced Officer Padron dead at\n\nthe scene. (RR 18: 205).\n\n\nEvidence\t\r  Recovered\t\r  After\t\r  Appellant\t\r  Taken\t\r  into\t\r  Custody\t\r  \n\n       Austin police officers removed appellant from the Walmart and searched\n\nhim for additional weapons. (RR 18: 235). Police found a magazine with six .380\n\nhollow point bullets6 in appellant’s pocket. (RR 19: 34). Homicide Detective\n\nBrett Bailey collected the appellant’s firearm at the scene.7 (RR 19: 64). The\n\nfirearm, a Jimenez Arms .380, still contained the magazine in the grip of the\n\nweapon. (RR 19: 65; SX49). The firearm had one live .380 cartridge in the\n\nchamber and one in the magazine. (RR 19: 65-66; SX27). Thus, when Detective\n\nBailey found the firearm, it was capable of firing two more rounds. (RR 19: 66).\n\nFirearms examination determined that the three casings found at the scene had all\n\nbeen fired from appellant’s gun. (RR 20: 145-146).\n\n       Police also searched the backpack appellant had with him and found Reese’s\n\nPeanut Butter ice cream bars, Little Debbie Oatmeal Crème Pies, three bags of\n\npeanuts, filet mignon steaks, beef jerky, Hostess CupCakes, and two bottles of\n\n\n6\n  Detective Bailey testified that hollow point bullets typically cause more damage upon impact\nthan lead ball ammunition. (RR 19: 62).\n7\n State’s exhibit 62 reflected appellant purchased this weapon on February 23, 2009, in Fort\nCollins, Colorado. (RR 20: 60-61). State’s exhibit 62 was admitted into evidence without\nobjection. (RR 20: 60).\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fKorbel Champagne. (RR 18: 235; RR 22: 57). Appellant had killed Officer\n\nPadron over $56.90 worth of shoplifted items. (RR 22: 62; SX78).8\n\n       Upon being taken into custody, appellant asked Austin police officer Albert\n\nArevalo9 questions regarding the county of the offense, the relative leniency of\n\nTravis County versus Williamson County, and if he would get life or death for\n\nwhat he had done. (RR 18: 245). Appellant winked and smiled at Officer Arevalo\n\nas he put him in a patrol car. (RR 18: 243). Officer Arevalo noticed that appellant\n\nhad red, watery eyes and slurred speech and seemed sleepy. (RR 18: 248). Yet,\n\nappellant was alert and oriented according to EMS protocol and politely answered\n\nquestions. (RR 18: 222). Appellant confirmed that he had no injuries or medical\n\nproblems, although he did have “blow back” blood on his face from Officer\n\nPadron’s fatal injury. (RR 18: 222; RR 19: 37-38; SX7). Appellant also told EMS\n\ntechnicians that he had not consumed any alcohol or drugs. (RR 18: 222).\n\nAppellant asked EMS technician Christopher Lester if he was going to get life in\n\nprison for “this.” (RR 18: 223). Appellant showed no emotion; he was “very\n\nblank, very cold.” (RR 18: 224).\n\n\n\n\n8\n The evidence of the specific food items and the total coast thereof was admitted at the\npunishment phase. (RR 22: 57, 62).\n9\n  Officer Arevalo spelled his name for the court reporter as “Arevalo,” but it is recorded in the\nrecord as “Arevelo.” (RR 18: 238). The State uses the spelling of the name as dictated into the\nrecord by the officer.\n\n                                                10\n\f      During transport to police headquarters, appellant talked to himself and\n\nmade a comment about “blasting” one of the officers in the car. (RR 19: 39, 45;\n\nSX15). At headquarters, appellant saw an old police department motorcycle that\n\nhe thought was cool, and he spontaneously admitted “I killed a cop.” (RR 18: 248-\n\n249; RR 19: 113). Appellant spoke matter of factly, without emotion. (RR 19:\n\n114). Later, when a nurse drew appellant’s blood pursuant to a warrant at the\n\nTravis County Jail, appellant chuckled, looked at his hands, and said “I guess I got\n\nthat cop’s blood on my hands.” (RR 19: 98-99). Appellant, indeed, had blood on\n\nhis hands. (RR 19: 98).\n\n      Appellant waived his Miranda rights and spoke with police. (RR 19: 117-\n\n118). The State played appellant’s recorded interrogation for the jury. (RR 19:\n\n142; SX59). Appellant appeared cognizant of his actions, used appropriate\n\nterminology, and did not present any indication of mental illness or lack of mental\n\nfitness. (RR 19: 119). Appellant admitted to have recently taken Xanax, but he did\n\nnot seem intoxicated. (RR 19: 120). Appellant knew every single detail involving\n\nhis murder of Officer Padron, including that he held his gun against Officer\n\nPadron’s skin. (RR 19: 131; RR 20: 57). He knew that he shot an Austin Police\n\nOfficer, and he admitted numerous times that he was the one who shot Officer\n\nPadron. (RR 20: 57).\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\fForensic\t\r  Evidence\t\r  \n\n       DNA testing confirmed the presence of Officer Padron’s DNA profile on\n\nappellant’s right hand. (RR 20: 84). Forensic testing of appellant’s blood showed\n\nno alcohol in his blood but revealed a high level of alprazolam (aka Xanax) and\n\nmarijuana. (RR 20: 89, 93-94, 100). Text messages recovered from appellant’s\n\ncell phone revealed that on April 4, 2012, appellant arranged for the purchase of\n\neight bars of Xanax and that, the next day, he increased that purchase request to ten\n\nbars. (RR 20: 24). Police executed a search warrant on appellant’s apartment and\n\ndiscovered sticky notes reading “stop fucking yourself up” and “when I rise to\n\npower, you will be sterilized.” (RR 20: 29-30, 32).\n\n\nEvidence\t\r  from\t\r  Officer\t\r  Padron’s\t\r  Autopsy\t\r  \n\n       Officer Padron suffered a gunshot wound to his neck, with the entrance\n\nwound under the left side of his neck (SX65) and the exit wound in the back right\n\nof his neck (SX66). (RR 20: 111). This gunshot travelled through Officer\n\nPadron’s voice box, fractured his fifth cervical vertebra (neck bone), and damaged\n\ntwo arteries that carried blood to his brain. (RR 20: 113). This gunshot created a\n\nlarge tear in the right common carotid artery and tore apart the vertebral artery.\n\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f(RR 20: 113-114). The gunshot injuries to these arteries caused rapid\n\nhemorrhaging and were fatal.10 (RR 20: 116-118).\n\n       Black gunpowder soot encircled the entrance wound on Officer Padron’s\n\nneck, confirming appellant placed the gun against his skin when he fired. (RR 20:\n\n122). The muzzle of the gun actually made contact with Officer Padron’s skin,\n\nleaving a muzzle imprint. (RR 20: 123). The medical examiner had no doubt that\n\nappellant pressed the gun barrel up against Officer Padron’s neck when he shot\n\nhim. (RR 20: 124). The overall path of the bullet was front to back and to the\n\nright. (RR 20: 114).\n\n       Appellant had also shot Officer Padron in the chest through the right breast\n\npocket of his uniform. (RR 20: 112). But, Officer Padron had been wearing an\n\narmored vest so he did not suffer any damage to his body from this gunshot. (RR\n\n20: 112). Firearms examination revealed that the distance of the gun’s muzzle to\n\nOfficer Padron’s uniform was less than 14 inches. (RR 20: 149).\n\n\nOfficer\t\r  Padron’s\t\r  Personal\t\r  and\t\r  Professional\t\r  Background\t\r  \n\n       Officer Padron grew up near San Angelo, Texas. (RR 20: 170). After\n\ngraduating high school in 1989, he joined the Marines and did a tour in Desert\n\nStorm, the first Gulf War. (RR 20: 170-171). He received many commendations\n\n\n10\n  The medical examiner confirmed that hollow point bullets cause more damage to a person’s\nbody than lead filled bullets. (RR 20: 116).\n\n\n                                             13\n\fwhile in the Marines and an honorable discharge. (RR 20: 171). After serving\n\nfour years in the Marines, Officer Padron became a corrections officer and then a\n\npolice officer, fulfilling a life-long dream. (RR 20: 172).\n\n      Officer Padron was a servant in his church, in his community, and for his\n\ncountry. (RR 20: 172). Officer Padron served 14 years with the City of San\n\nAngelo Police Department and became a detective. (RR 20: 173). He also worked\n\nwith middle school students in San Angelo and had a positive impact on their lives,\n\nleading students to become Marines or police officers. (RR 20: 173-174).\n\n      Supporting his wife’s career choice, Officer Padron moved to Austin with\n\nhis family. (RR 20: 175). He became a patrol officer with the Austin Police\n\nDepartment, and he was very happy. (RR 20: 175). Officer Padron’s brother had\n\noffered him a more lucrative job in San Angelo, but Officer Padron declined it\n\nbecause he loved being a police officer and being in Austin with his two young\n\ndaughters. (RR 20: 176).\n\n      At the time of his murder, Officer Padron was planning his life with a new\n\ngirlfriend. (RR 20: 178). He and his girlfriend were looking for a home with\n\nproperty for horses, which he loved. (RR 20: 178). But, the “world turned to a\n\nvery ugly place” for the Padron family the day their son and brother was killed.\n\n(RR 20: 181). After a funeral in Austin, the family took Officer Padron back home\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fto San Angelo. (RR 20: 181). The City of San Angelo dedicated a park in Officer\n\nPadron’s honor. (RR 20: 181-182).\n\n\nDefense\t\r  Evidence\t\r  at\t\r  Guilt/Innocence\t\r  \t\r  \n\n       Jenna Feland dated appellant from July of 2008, till December of 2011,\n\nwhen he ended the relationship. (RR 20: 185). Appellant used drugs while the\n\ncouple lived in Colorado, mostly using marijuana, but he also did mushrooms,\n\nacid, and Ecstasy. (RR 20: 189-190). In fact, appellant took Ecstasy daily. (RR\n\n20: 190).\n\n       Feland claimed that appellant did not do well after their break up, and\n\nappellant told Feland he was really sad and “in a downward spiral.” (RR 20: 12).\n\nAppellant started drinking and taking Xanax. (RR 20: 193). Despite the alleged\n\ndownward spiral, appellant had a new girlfriend, Nikki Nance, that same\n\nDecember, and he and Feland barely had contact prior to this offense. (RR 20:\n\n206, 231-232).\n\n       Feland confirmed that appellant did not have a mental illness. (RR 20: 207).\n\nBy impeaching Feland with her grand jury testimony, the State established that\n\nappellant was not generally a depressed person and that Feland was not aware of\n\nappellant having mental problems. (RR 20: 228, 234). Feland described appellant\n\nas a quiet and reserved person who got depressed when he got in trouble. (RR 20:\n\n234-235).\n\n\n                                                15\n\f      On cross-examination, the State also established that Feland and appellant\n\ndiscussed him selling his story for $100,000, although she denied it at trial. (RR\n\n20: 200). State’s exhibit 71, a videotaped recording of Feland visiting appellant in\n\njail on April 24, 2012, showed appellant had the idea to sell his story of this capital\n\nmurder, and Feland laughed throughout the video. (RR 20: 214; RR 23: 76).\n\nAlso, while in jail, appellant created a secret code so that he and Feland could\n\ncommunicate without law enforcement understanding what they had written. (RR\n\n20: 215).\n\n      Dr. Matthew Masters, an addiction medicine practitioner, reviewed multiple\n\nevidentiary items from the defense in preparation for his trial testimony. (RR 21:\n\n18). Dr. Masters testified that Xanax was a highly addictive drug and the number\n\none benzodiazepine on the street because it was fast-acting. (RR 21: 5, 11-12). Dr.\n\nMasters observed appellant on the crime scene video at Walmart, and the manner\n\nin which appellant exited his motorcycle was consistent with a person intoxicated\n\nby a benzodiazepine. (RR 21: 19). The SWIFS lab report showed appellant had\n\ntoxic levels of alprazolam in his system seven hours after his arrest, and his\n\ntoxicity level was consistent with having taken 8 to 10 Xanax pills. (RR 21: 20-\n\n21). Thus, Dr. Masters opined that appellant’s statement to police the night of the\n\noffense was totally unreliable due to confabulation. (RR 21: 23-24). Dr. Masters\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fdescribed appellant as an addict based on his history, his behavior, and his lab\n\nreports. (RR 21: 27).\n\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Masters confirmed that prior to April 2012 he had\n\nnot treated appellant or seen him in a professional manner. (RR 21: 33). Dr.\n\nMasters conducted only a diagnostic evaluation based on what appellant told him,\n\nwhat the defense provided him, and the grand jury testimony of appellant’s new\n\ngirlfriend. (RR 21: 33). Dr. Masters did not consult any members of appellant’s\n\nfamily or a psychiatrist appellant had previously seen11, and Dr. Masters was not a\n\npsychiatrist. (RR 21: 34). Dr. Masters had not seen the crime scene videotape to\n\nknow that appellant’s statement to police was consistent with that tape, thus\n\nundermining his opinion that appellant’s statement was due to confabulation. (RR\n\n21: 38). Appellant’s statement in the police car that he killed a police officer also\n\nrebutted Dr. Masters’ assessment of confabulation. (RR 21: 38-39).\n\n       After approximately one hour of deliberations, the jury found appellant\n\nguilty of capital murder as alleged in the indictment. (RR 21: 99, 101).\n\n\n\n\n11\n  At punishment it was revealed that appellant self-reported that he had seen a psychiatrist in\nsixth grade, but there was no evidence of the alleged doctor’s name or a diagnosis. (RR 24: 155-\n156).\n\n\n                                              17\n\f             STATEMENT OF FACTS FROM PUNISHMENT PHASE\n\nThe\t\r  Night\t\r  of\t\r  this\t\r  Capital\t\r  Murder\t\r  Offense\t\r  \n\n        Appellant and his roommate Kelvin Davis12 drank and smoked marijuana\n\nthe night leading to the murder of Officer Padron. (RR 22: 123). Appellant drank\n\ntequila, at least a half a liter of it, and Davis drank rum. (RR 22: 124, 145-146).\n\nAppellant also took Xanax; in fact, he took approximately six pills, more than\n\nDavis thought appellant could handle. (RR 22: 125). That evening, Davis and\n\nappellant walked to a nearby convenience store, and appellant talked about robbing\n\nthe store. (RR 22: 127-128). Davis tried to downplay appellant’s idea to rob the\n\nstore because appellant didn’t need any further legal troubles. (RR 22: 128).\n\nAppellant responded that he had gotten “away with worse shit.” (RR 22: 128-129).\n\n\nLack\t\r  of\t\r  Remorse\t\r  and\t\r  Extraneous\t\r  Bad\t\r  Acts\t\r  in\t\r  Texas\t\r  \n\n        Officer Cory Knop transported appellant from the Walmart to the Austin\n\nPolice Department that fateful day. (RR 22: 18). Appellant nonchalantly admitted\n\nthat he killed a cop. (RR 22: 19). Appellant also asked Officer Knop if he\n\nremembered him, which Officer Knop did. Officer Knop met appellant February\n\n2, 2012, when he arrested him for driving while intoxicated. (RR 22: 19-20).\n\nOfficer Knop conducted field sobriety tests on appellant and transported him to\n\n\n12\n  In January of 2012, Davis searched for a roommate in Austin on Craigslist and found\nappellant. (RR 22: 116).\n\n\n\n                                                      18\n\fjail, all of which was videotaped. (RR 22: 21; SX72). During the DWI encounter,\n\nappellant volunteered that he had worked multiple times as an informant for the\n\npolice in Colorado. (RR 22: 27). Appellant asked Officer Knop not to impound\n\nhis vehicle and if there were anything he could do to help appellant with the\n\ncharges. (RR 22: 28). Appellant pleaded that he was a productive member of\n\nsociety and not a bad guy. (RR 22: 28-29). Appellant asked Officer Knop if he\n\nthought the arrest was right and if he ever felt bad or if he had done the wrong\n\nthing. (RR 22: 29-30). Appellant was polite and did not seem threatening to\n\nOfficer Knop. (RR 22: 22-23). But, appellant was also polite the night he\n\nmurdered Officer Padron. (RR 22: 23).\n\n      About five weeks earlier, on December 27, 2011, DPS Trooper Charles\n\nHoover stopped appellant for speeding on a highway between Amarillo and\n\nLubbock. (RR 22: 167-168). The odor of marijuana from appellant’s vehicle was\n\nquite strong, and Trooper Hoover found marijuana in appellant’s vehicle and\n\narrested him. (RR 22: 169, 171). Trooper Hoover seized from appellant’s vehicle\n\na grinder, marijuana pipe, and three pill bottles for prescription marijuana from\n\nColorado that were not in appellant’s name. (RR 22: 174-175; SX81, 82).\n\nVideotaped evidence from this arrest showed appellant was very compliant with\n\nthe officer and stated that he wanted to be a productive member of society. (RR\n\n22: 168-169, 173; SX80).\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f      Austin Police Detective Roy Rector was a certified forensics examiner, and\n\nhe analyzed evidence from two computers seized after appellant’s arrest for\n\nmurdering Officer Padron. (RR 22: 44). Rector retrieved four photographs\n\n(SX73-76) from the logical path Users\\danielbra\\documents\\MY\n\nBACKUP\\JENNA BACKUP\\Pictures. (RR 22: 45-48). The file was created May,\n\n26, 2011, but the pictures were taken in March and May of 2009, all by the same\n\ncamera. (RR 22: 46-47). The pictures (SX 73-76) were of appellant’s tattooed\n\narm holding a gun and of a bullet hole in a wall. (RR 22: 45, 47; RR 23: 72;\n\nSX83). Nikki Nance had seen appellant’s gun approximately ten times; appellant\n\nthought having a gun looked “cool.” (RR 22: 95-96). Appellant also bragged to\n\nNance that he would drive really fast on his motorcycle and that he had outrun the\n\npolice in Colorado. (RR 22: 97).\n\n      Kristina “Nikki” Nance testified for the State with a testimonial immunity\n\nagreement. (RR 22: 87). In late 2011 or early 2012, appellant met Nance through\n\na posting on Craigslist. (RR 22: 89). They used lots of drugs, to-wit: Xanax,\n\ncocaine, acid, mushrooms, and Ecstasy, most of which appellant purchased for\n\nthem. (RR 22: 90-91). As Nance’s and appellant’s relationship continued, their\n\ndrug usage increased. (RR 22: 101-102). Appellant began using heavier drugs and\n\nmixing them. (RR 22: 102). Nance recalled a time when appellant wanted to find\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\fan “eight ball” of cocaine. (RR 22: 92). Appellant tried to get his roommate Davis\n\nto do cocaine, but he refused. (RR 22: 119-120).\n\n       Nance’s and appellant’s friendship ended when she fronted him $600 to\n\npurchase drugs, and he never paid her back even though he made a lot more money\n\nthan Nance did and made her late on her rent. (RR 22: 93-94, 95). Appellant once\n\ntold Davis that he would kill Nikki Nance if she damaged his car. (RR 22: 132).\n\nYet, appellant did not seem psychotic or violent to Davis, even when appellant\n\nused drugs. (RR 22: 132-133).\n\n       Appellant seemed intelligent to Davis. (RR 22: 132). Appellant never\n\ndiscussed any family issues with his mother or father and never lamented a bad\n\nchildhood. (RR 22: 133). Appellant told Davis about outrunning the police on his\n\nmotorcycle. (RR 22: 129).\n\n       While in the Del Valle jail after his arrest for this capital murder, appellant\n\nmet inmate Luis Escalante because Escalante was curious about the jail uniform13\n\nappellant was wearing. (RR 23: 33). Appellant asked Escalante if he had seen the\n\nperson on the news who had killed the cop at Walmart. (RR 23: 34). Appellant\n\nshowed Escalante a picture of himself from the newspaper, and appellant smirked\n\nand chuckled about the killing. (RR 23: 35). Escalante asked appellant if he had\n\n\n13\n  Escalante explained that persons wearing the orange and white stripes are “high felons,”\npersons who committed aggravated crimes or murders. (RR 23: 33).\n\n\n\n                                               21\n\fany remorse for the killing or sympathy for his victim, and appellant shook his\n\nhead “no.” (RR 23: 36).\n\n       Appellant admitted to Escalante that he grabbed Officer Padron by the neck\n\nand shot him and that he fired several times. (RR 23: 52-53). Appellant claimed\n\nhe went to Walmart to get pills “to get his mind right.” (RR 23: 53). He had\n\nplanned to rob the Walmart pharmacy but not harm the police officer. (RR 23: 54).\n\nAppellant also told Escalante that Officer Padron told him he was taking him in\n\nbecause he was intoxicated. (RR 23: 54-55).\n\n\nExtraneous\t\r  Bad\t\r  Acts\t\r  Committed\t\r  in\t\r  Colorado\t\r  \n\n       On January 25, 2007, Shawn Wycoff of the Colorado State Patrol clocked\n\nappellant going 80 m.p.h. in a 55 m.p.h. speed zone on his “highlighter green”\n\nmotorcycle. (RR 23: 8-9. 11). Wycoff attempted to pull over appellant for\n\nspeeding, but appellant accelerated and fled, making numerous lane changes and\n\nreaching speeds of 90-95 m.p.h. (RR 23: 9, 14). Wycoff radioed another trooper\n\nfor assistance who was able to stop appellant. (RR 23: 10-11). Appellant\n\npresented his driver’s license for identification, but he did not have an endorsement\n\nallowing him to drive a motorcycle. (RR 23: 11). The trooper arrested appellant\n\nfor improper endorsement on his license, eluding a police officer, and possession\n\nof marijuana, which the trooper found in appellant’s pants pocket. (RR 23: 12-13).\n\nAppellant admitted that he was out joyriding, racing a friend on the interstate, and\n\n\n                                               22\n\fhe fled from police because he didn’t want to get caught, lose his license, or lose\n\nhis motorcycle, which was without plates. (RR 23: 12).\n\n        In April of 2012, Caresa Marino, a patrol officer in Cheyenne, Wyoming,\n\nsaw a news report about appellant killing Officer Padron. (RR 23: 19-20).\n\nMarino’s immediate reaction was “wow, I know that kid. He threatened me in the\n\nsixth grade.” (RR 23: 20). Marino was not surprised to see appellant on the news.\n\n(RR 23: 20).\n\n        Marino and appellant attended school together in Parker, Colorado. (RR 23:\n\n21). In November of 1999, appellant threatened Marino when she was playing\n\nsoccer with her friends at recess. (RR 23: 22, 24). Totally unprovoked, appellant\n\nran up to Marino, told her to lock her doors and windows because he was going to\n\ngo to her house and rape her. (RR 23: 22). Appellant also called Marino a “bitch”\n\nand a “fucker.” (RR 23: 22). Appellant and his friends claimed he was just joking,\n\nbut Marino did not find it funny. (RR 23: 27, 28).\n\n\nExtraneous\t\r  Bad\t\r  Acts\t\r  and\t\r  Disciplinary\t\r  Violations\t\r  in\t\r  Jail\t\r  \n\n        On May 20, 2012, appellant reported to corrections officer Farial Garrie in\n\nthe maximum security section of the Del Valle jail that he had found a bunch of\n\ngreen and orange pills in the jail dayroom and that he had taken them in a suicide\n\nattempt. (RR 22: 149-151). Appellant was transported to Brackenridge Hospital\n\nfor the apparent suicide attempt. (RR 23: 74). The physician’s summary reflected\n\n\n                                                   23\n\fthat appellant claimed to have taken a bag of pills he found taped under a chair.\n\n(RR 23: 74; SX84). The records further reflected that appellant decompensated in\n\nthe emergency room and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. (RR 23:\n\n75). But, appellant’s urine and serum drug screens were negative. (RR 23: 75).14\n\nFurthermore, corrections officers had searched the dayroom before allowing\n\ninmates into it, and they had not found any pills. (RR 22: 152-153).\n\n       Corrections officers searched appellant’s cell thereafter and found a strip of\n\npaper with a key to decipher coded messages from appellant. (RR 22: 162-163).\n\nCorrections officers found further evidence that appellant intended to bypass jail\n\nsecurity by sending the coded paper to his mother through correspondence to his\n\nattorney. (RR 22: 163).\n\n       In June of 2012, appellant was housed in a psychiatric observation cell in the\n\nDel Valle jail. (RR 22: 64). On June 3, 2012, corrections officer Dustin Rade\n\nsearched appellant’s cell for contraband and found hooch, ingredients for an\n\nintoxicating beverage, hidden behind the toilet. (RR 22: 65-66). Appellant\n\nviolated jail rules by possessing the hooch. (RR 22: 67). Officer Rade again found\n\ncontraband items in appellant’s cell on August 17, 2012. (RR 22: 68). Officer\n\nRade found six pills hidden in the window ledge. (RR 22: 68-69). Appellant\n14\n   During the defense presentation of evidence at the punishment phase, Dr. Harold Scott\ntestified that, from his review of appellant’s medical records, he believed appellant took an\noverdose of Haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug. (RR 25: 168, 173). Haloperidol was the generic\nversion of Haldol, the most common psychological drug in an institutional setting. (RR 25: 168,\n173). Dr. Scott testified that the hospital did not screen for Haldol. (RR 25: 172).\n\n                                              24\n\fviolated jail rules by possessing the pills, which could only be prescribed by\n\nmedical staff. (RR 22: 70). Appellant also kept in his cell a list with the jailers’\n\nnames and their routines and activities. The list of names contained various\n\ndescriptions of the officers, e.g., appellant said Officer Rade “equals the devil.”\n\n(RR 22: 81-82).\n\n      In October of 2012, Escalante encountered appellant having a secret talk\n\nwith another inmate, Troy Williams, who was housed across from appellant. (RR\n\n23: 36-37, 67). Appellant and Williams admitted to Escalante that they were\n\nplanning an escape when appellant was transported for his court hearing in January\n\nof 2013. (RR 23: 36-37, 67). Escalante actually overheard them discussing escape\n\nplans on two different occasions. (RR 23: 38). Williams explained to Escalante\n\nthat appellant planned for someone to come to the jail with a gun and start shooting\n\ncorrections officers. (RR 23: 37, 38). The day before Escalante testified in this\n\ntrial, he overheard appellant telling another inmate that Escalante was not\n\ntrustworthy and was a “snitch.” (RR 23: 39).\n\n      On August 6, 2013, Travis County Sheriff’s Deputy Donald MacIntyre\n\nheard a commotion and applause coming from the dayroom. (RR 23: 196). He\n\nlooked into the dayroom and saw appellant taking a bow among the inmates. (RR\n\n23: 196). The inmates had just watched a news story on the television regarding\n\nappellant and a court hearing in this capital murder. (RR 23: 196-197). After\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\fappellant took his bow, an inmate yelled “fuck the police,” and appellant\n\nacknowledged that inmate by raising his fist in the air. (RR 23: 202). A camera in\n\nthe jail captured this event, and the video of it (SX97) was played for the jury. (RR\n\n23: 204).\n\n\nAppellant’s\t\r  Mail\t\r  and\t\r  Recorded\t\r  Phone\t\r  Conversations\t\r  in\t\r  Jail\t\r  \n\n       Due to the report that appellant planned to overtake a corrections officer to\n\nescape, Austin Police Detective David Fugitt realized that he needed to check\n\nappellant’s phone calls daily for the officers’ safety. (RR 23: 83-84). Detective\n\nFugitt listened to approximately 16 hours of appellant’s recorded phone\n\nconversations. (RR 23: 84). Fugitt also read appellant’s mail and emails and\n\nwatched video of his visitations. (RR 23: 84). Appellant never expressed remorse\n\nfor killing Officer Padron in any of those communications. (RR 23: 84). His only\n\nexpression of remorse came during his interrogation, and it was initially in regard\n\nto himself. (RR 23: 84).\n\n       The State played SX85, a phone conversation between appellant and his\n\nmother recorded on April 25, 2012, while appellant was in jail. (RR 23: 76-77).\n\nAppellant told his mother that he had been sent to the health services building in\n\nthe jail for being depressed. (RR 23: 77). But, he disagreed with the depression\n\ndiagnosis because he was joking about being depressed or committing suicide.\n\n(RR 23: 77). Appellant also wrote his sister after a hospital visit. (RR 23: 114;\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fSX91). Appellant wrote that he was put in the hospital after he joked about no\n\nsharp objects and called jail officials “stupid.” (RR 23: 114).\n\n      On March 10, 2013, appellant had another recorded phone conversation with\n\nhis mother. (RR 23: 79; SX86). In that conversation, appellant gave his mother a\n\ncode for a secret alphabet so they could bypass security at the jail in regard to their\n\nmail. (RR 23: 79). Appellant had drawn an image of an alien utilizing a shading\n\ntechnique where the letters of the alphabet were written inside the image. (RR 23:\n\n79-80). Appellant called his mother again on March 31, 2013, and discussed\n\nmurderabilia. (RR 23: 81). In another phone conversation with his mother,\n\nappellant said an inmate offered him $30 for his artwork, the most money he knew\n\nof being offered for artwork. (RR 23: 101). So, appellant made a copy of the\n\nartwork to sell “just for the bragging rights.” (RR 23: 101-102).\n\n      Anthony Angel, with the Travis County Sheriff’s Office security threat unit,\n\ncopied appellant’s mail at the request of Detective Fugitt. (RR 23: 106).\n\nAppellant primarily wrote letters to his mother, sister, and Feland. (RR 23: 110).\n\nHis mother set up a pen pal account for him on meet-an-inmate.com, and he asked\n\nher to make his profile sound “more bad” because people might be looking for\n\nsomeone “more criminal-ish.” (RR 23: 112). Appellant wrote his mother that he\n\nwas at the top of the prison pecking order in relation to crimes committed. (RR 23:\n\n113; SX90). In letters to Feland, appellant said he did not like being in the general\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fprison population because he didn’t particularly get along with inmates or cops\n\nbecause they were “not [his] type of people.” (RR 23: 115). Appellant reminded\n\nFeland to allow him to run the defense and to not talk to anyone on his legal team\n\nbecause “they [were] only out for themselves.” (RR 23: 116; SX93). In another\n\nletter, appellant told Feland “not much else going on. Just living the dream. I’m\n\nretired at 25.” (RR 23: 118; SX95). He added a smiley face. (RR 23: 118).\n\n          According to Deputy Angel, coded mail presented security concerns\n\nregarding escape plans or attacks on officers or other inmates. (RR 23: 107).\n\nInmates who kept notes on the movements of guards in the jail also presented\n\nsecurity concerns regarding escape attempts or assaults on staff. (RR 23: 107).\n\n\nInmate\t\r  Classification\t\r  System\t\r  and\t\r  Prison\t\r  “Society”\t\r  \n\n          Stephen Rogers, a retired warden and corrections officer, testified regarding\n\nthe prison classification system for inmates. A person sentenced to life without\n\nparole was classified as a G3 and was in the general population. (RR 23: 134). A\n\nG3 classified inmate had all the privileges15 of a minimum security G2 inmate\n\nexcept that he could not be housed in a dormitory outside the prison but within the\n\nouter fence. (RR 23: 135). The G3 inmate had the same contact with prison staff\n\nand volunteers as a G2 and went to chow and walked the hallways without\n\nhandcuffs. (RR 23: 136). The prison provided food, beds, and television to the\n15\n     These privileges included contact visits and commissary eligibility. (RR 23: 135).\n\n\n                                                 28\n\fprisoner; radios were available for purchase in the commissary. (RR 23: 190).\n\nPrisoners in the general population were allowed to make phone calls, receive\n\nemails, and have contact with family members. (RR 23: 160, 191). Yet, prisoners\n\nin the general population sometimes attacked, caused serious bodily injury, and/or\n\nkilled prison guards. (RR 23: 191). On the other hand, a prisoner under a death\n\nsentence was classified like an administrative segregation prisoner, i.e., he was\n\nconfined to his cell 23 hours a day and allowed one hour for recreation. (RR 23:\n\n138).\n\n        Rogers discussed the problem with inmates making weapons in prison with\n\nsome prisoners smart enough to make weapons out of “just about anything[.]” (RR\n\n23: 148-154). And, if a prisoner couldn’t make a weapon, he had the opportunity\n\nto obtain one from another inmate. (RR 23: 154). And, prisoners had access to\n\ndangerous items through prison industry. (RR 23: 155).\n\n        Prisoners also found ways to access contraband, with cell phones being the\n\nforemost problem.16 (RR 23: 157). Prisoners often used cell phones to contact\n\ntheir victims or persons who testified against them. (RR 23: 157). Drugs were\n\nlikewise a problem in the prison system and easier to smuggle than cell phones.\n\n\n\n\n16\n  One prisoner even managed to access Rogers’ Facebook account even though he was in\npermanent lockup. (RR 23: 157).\n\n\n                                            29\n\f(RR 23: 158). Many prisoners were adept at making alcoholic beverages, called\n\nhooch or chalk. (RR 23: 158-159).\n\n       As a warden, Rogers would have concerns with an inmate who attempted to\n\ncommunicate with people outside of prison through coded mail. (RR 23: 159).\n\nSuch a prisoner presented a threat to correctional officers, other inmates, and even\n\nthe public. (RR 23: 160-161). Rogers would also have security concerns about a\n\nprisoner who tracked the activities of correctional officers. (RR 23: 161).\n\nPrisoners inclined to commit acts of violence would have opportunities to commit\n\nacts of violence or kill while in prison. (RR 23: 164). And, prisoners who had\n\nanimus toward police officers would have opportunities in prison to hurt them.\n\n(RR 23: 164).\n\n\nOfficer\t\r  Padron’s\t\r  Personal\t\r  and\t\r  Professional\t\r  History\t\r  \n\n       Officer Padron’s older sister, Linda Diaz, testified that Officer Padron\n\nenlisted in the Marine Corps when he was just 17 years old and still in high school.\n\n(RR 23: 210). After service with the Marines, Officer Padron worked as a\n\ncorrections officer, first for the Eden Detention Center and then the San Angelo\n\nPolice Department. (RR 23: 210). Officer Padron moved to Austin and became\n\nemployed with the airport police and then transferred to the Austin Police\n\nDepartment. (RR 23: 210-211). Killed at age 40, Officer Padron had given more\n\n\n\n\n                                               30\n\fthan half his life serving his country and his community and protecting the public.\n\n(RR 23: 211).\n\n        Diaz described her brother as a very honorable man of integrity and\n\ncommitment. (RR 23: 211). She described Officer Padron’s first act of bravery as\n\na rookie police officer when he twice ran into a burning building to save victims.\n\nFirst, he attempted to save two children, and then he ran back into the house to\n\nsave a fellow officer who had not emerged from the burning home. (RR 23: 212).\n\nAlthough divorced, Officer Padron was a dedicated father to his two young\n\ndaughters, aged 6 and 10 at the time of his death. (RR 23: 212). He was even\n\ninvolved in their school because he loved being around children. (RR 23: 213).\n\n        While working full-time for the San Angelo Police Department, Officer\n\nPadron continued his education, earning degrees in psychology and criminal\n\njustice. (RR 23: 213). He graduated with honors. (RR 23: 213). And, Officer\n\nPadron had a positive impact on his nieces and nephews. (RR 23: 213). One\n\nnephew was following in his footsteps and had enlisted in the Marines. (RR 23:\n\n213).\n\n        Officer Padron was “very caring” and “very loving.” (RR 23: 214). His\n\ndaughters missed their “tremendous daddy” time. (RR 23: 214). Officer Padron\n\nwas also very close to his parents, especially his father who was not in very good\n\nhealth. (RR 23: 214). Officer Padron’s parents and siblings attended the trial, and\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\fhaving to hear the testimony was “horrifying” and “almost unbearable.” (RR 23:\n\n214). Diaz could see her parents’ pain every day and testified that “no parent\n\nshould have to go through this” and “[h]is little girls shouldn’t have to go through\n\ntheir life without their father.” (RR 23: 214).\n\n\nDefense\t\r  Evidence\t\r  at\t\r  the\t\r  Punishment\t\r  Phase\t\r  \n\n       Travis County corrections officer Richard Low had contact with appellant\n\nduring his two-year time in the health services building. (RR 24: 10). Deputy Low\n\ndescribed appellant as compliant and respectful to him. (RR 24: 11). But, on\n\ncross-examination, Deputy Low testified that an inmate was not compliant if he\n\nmade hooch, hoarded prescription pills, or tracked the movements and activities of\n\ncorrections officers. (RR 24: 14-15). All those activities were violations of jail\n\nregulations, as was sending coded messages to civilian persons through legal mail\n\nin the jail. (RR 24: 15). Appellant further violated jail regulations by giving\n\nhimself a homemade tattoo. (RR 24: 39). Psychological evidence showed\n\nappellant was capable of following rules if he so chose, but he did not like to be\n\ncontrolled by other people. (RR 24: 127, 151).\n\n       Dr. James Ascough, employed with the USDA, testified via Skype for the\n\ndefense. (RR 24: 43). He met the appellant through a work-study program when\n\nappellant was a student at Colorado State University. (RR 24: 45). Dr. Ascough\n\ndescribed appellant as a very good programmer. (RR 24:49). Appellant had Dr.\n\n\n                                                32\n\fAscough had co-authored a chapter in a book entitled Advances in Nitrogen\n\nManagement for Water Quality. (RR 24: 53-54). Appellant worked with Dr.\n\nAscough at the USDA for approximately 18 months, from 2009 to Christmas 2010.\n\n(RR 24: 56). Dr. Ascough encouraged appellant to continue working with him and\n\nto attend graduate school, but appellant wanted to begin working and earn money.\n\n(RR 24: 57-58). Appellant took the job with Hewlett-Packard in Austin, and the\n\ntwo ceased contact in early to mid 2011. (RR 24: 57-58). Dr. Ascough thought\n\nappellant was a quiet, hardworking, and respectful “kid,” and he was “stunned”\n\nwhen he heard about appellant killing Officer Padron. (RR 24: 59).\n\n      Cross-examination revealed that Dr. Ascough actually knew very little about\n\nappellant. (RR 24: 66). He did not know that appellant used marijuana and\n\nalcohol daily and that he regularly used cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, and acid\n\nduring his college career. (RR 24: 65-66). Dr. Ascough was aware that appellant\n\nhad a girlfriend, but he didn’t know her name. (RR 24: 65). Appellant told Dr.\n\nAscough about his motorcycle, that he liked to go fast, and that he eluded police on\n\nit. (RR 24: 67). Appellant was not embarrassed about that. (RR 24: 67).\n\n      Dr. William Carter prepared a psychological study on appellant for the\n\ndefense. (RR 24: 78). Dr. Carter twice interviewed appellant in 2014. (RR 24:\n\n83). In early adolescence, appellant began to emotionally withdraw and about age\n\n\n\n\n                                        33\n\f12 he fell into depression. (RR 24: 88, 91-92). Appellant began to experiment\n\nwith drugs in middle school to escape his depression. (RR 24: 95-96).\n\n       Appellant avoided social contact, and Dr. Carter described him as\n\nhumorless. (RR 24: 96). As a teenager, appellant felt lonely and isolated.17 (RR\n\n24: 101). Dr. Carter thought appellant’s depression probably worsened into his\n\nteenage years, and he felt helpless and suicidal and hated his life. (RR 24: 106).\n\nYet, appellant was not depressed to the point of psychosis. (RR 24: 118). A\n\ncommon theme in appellant’s life was his overstatement of his importance by\n\nbragging, pushing limits, or letting others know how smart he was. (RR 24: 102).\n\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Carter confirmed that the people he interviews\n\nhave a personal bias to present themselves in a manner in accord with their\n\nperceived best interest. (RR 24: 154). Dr. Carter conceded that it was possible\n\nappellant claimed he was depressed only after meeting with Dr. Carter and\n\ndeciding it was to his benefit to be depressed. (RR 24: 162). But, regardless of\n\none’s depression level, Dr. Carter confirmed that a person would know not to kill a\n\npolice officer. (RR 24: 167).\n\n       Appellant’s report to Dr. Carter of his lack of friends was disputed by his\n\ndisciplinary records from high school and college. (RR 24: 157-158). The\n17\n  Cross-examination revealed that appellant had had friends with whom he played guitar and\nrode motorcycles. (RR 24: 157). These friends were apparently so well known that appellant\ntold his mother in letters to use the names of these friends as clues she could insert into his codes.\n(RR 24: 157).\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fdisciplinary records indicated appellant acted in concert with others in sneaking\n\naround the halls or out of classes, of using drugs behind Hobby Lobby with his\n\nmotorcycle-riding friends, and for showing affection on campus to a girl. (RR 24:\n\n157-158). Appellant’s disciplinary records also reflected assaultive conduct by\n\nhim. (RR 24: 159). In one incident, appellant “sucker punched” another boy in the\n\nlocker room. (RR 24: 159). The person writing the report was concerned because\n\nappellant showed no remorse for the assault. (RR 24: 159).\n\n       Dr. Carter admitted in cross-examination that appellant displayed\n\nmanipulative and controlling behaviors before and after this capital offense. (RR\n\n24: 162-163). Appellant used Nikki Nance to get drugs, and he told Jenna Feland\n\nto not talk to anyone about him, including his lawyers, mitigator, private eye, etc.\n\nuntil he told her to. (RR 24: 162-164; SX93).\n\n       Appellant told Dr. Carter that he went to the Walmart to steal18 and he took\n\nhis gun with him “just in case.” (RR 24: 167). Appellant knew he shot a police\n\nofficer, and, by the extent of the injury, he knew the officer was dead. (RR 24:\n\n169). Dr. Carter admitted that appellant lacked empathy. (RR 24: 164). The fact\n\nthat appellant planned to profit from this capital murder was disturbing to one of\n\nhis psychologists. (RR 25: 132).\n\n\n18\n  Evidence showed appellant had recently received a promotion at work and earned\napproximately $65,000 to $70,000 at his job. (RR 24: 180).\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\f       The defense also presented Dr. Walter Harrell, a psychologist specializing in\n\nneuropsychology and rehabilitation psychology. (RR 24: 222). Based on\n\nappellant’s self-reported frontal lobe injuries,19 Dr. Harrell thought appellant had\n\nbeen struggling with depression and sadness his whole life. (RR 24: 249, 254).\n\nDr. Harrell opined that appellant’s multiple concussive events20 predisposed him to\n\nhave struggles with depression, suicidal idealization, and substance abuse. (RR\n\n25:98). Dr. Harrell claimed appellant had a substance abuse disorder that had\n\nbeen evident since third grade. (RR 24: 255). This testimony, however, was also\n\nbased on appellant’s self-report that he began drinking alcohol and smoking\n\nmarijuana in third grade; appellant also claimed he did cocaine with his father.\n\n(RR 24: 256).\n\n       Even Dr. Harrell reported that appellant showed a complete lack of remorse\n\nfor killing Officer Padron.21 (RR 25: 131-132). Appellant told Dr. Harrell that he\n\nwent to Walmart to steal groceries, that he carried a gun, was pursued by an\n\n19\n  One such injury resulted from a skateboarding accident when appellant was 14 years old, but\nappellant’s brain scan following this accident was normal. (RR 25: 79).\n20\n  On cross-examination, Dr. Harrell acknowledged that appellant was very intelligent, and he\nhad no difficutly communicating with him. (RR 25:82-83). He also had to acknowledge that his\nassessment of appellant’s frontal lobe injuries was merely an inference based on unsubstantiated\nreports of head injuries from appellant. (RR 25: 85-87). In one such report, appellant told Dr.\nHarrell of a head injury he sustained when he was 18 months old. Dr. Harrell admitted that at\nsuch a young age, appellant would not have an independent recollection of that event. (RR 25:\n85-87).\n21\n  Appellant’s aunt, who was the County Attorney for Pottawatomie County, Kansas, testified\nthat appellant had never expressed remorse for killing Officer Padron. (RR 25: 22, 60).\n\n\n\n                                              36\n\fofficer, and shot him. (RR 25: 102). Dr. Harrell testified that appellant struggled\n\nwith impulse control all of his life. (RR 25: 104). But, he thought appellant’s\n\nkilling of Officer Padron was a drug-related problem. (RR 25: 105). Appellant\n\ncould become dangerous and commit acts of violence in prison if he was under the\n\ninfluence of alcohol or drugs. (RR 25: 111).\n\n        Dr. Harrell further confirmed on cross-examination that no mitigating\n\nfactors of sexual abuse, physical abuse, mental retardation, homelessness, or lack\n\nof food were present in this case. (RR 25: 128-129). Even though appellant\n\ncommitted various offenses as a juvenile, he never did time in the juvenile system.\n\n(RR 25: 130). Appellant was highly intelligent, had excelled in school, and had\n\neven graduated Colorado State University with honors in a highly technical field.\n\n(RR 25: 129). At the time of this offense, appellant had a good job with a national\n\ncompany and had no work-related issues. (RR 25: 129-130).\n\n        Psychiatrist Dr. Harold Scott diagnosed appellant with depressive and\n\naddictive problems. (RR 25: 180). Dr. Scott testified appellant was highly\n\naddictive, having used substances since age nine to “obliterate reality” and self-\n\nmedicate for his depression. (RR 25: 208-209). Appellant used alcohol, cough\n\nsyrup, marijuana, and computer duster (an inhalant) by age thirteen. (RR 25: 208-\n\n209).\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f        On August 26, 2012, corrections officer Stephen Crim found appellant on\n\ntop of his bunk with his hands in the air vent. (RR 24: 199-200). Crim searched\n\nappellant’s cell and found torn bedsheets fastened into a noose and a three-foot\n\nlong rope. (RR 24: 201). The noose was in the air vent. (RR 24: 201). Just\n\nexpressing suicidal feelings would get an inmate transferred to the health services\n\nbuilding in jail. (RR 24: 40). On another occasion, an inmate reported to Crim\n\nthat he overheard appellant and another inmate discussing escape plans because\n\nthey were tired of being in jail and wanted out. (RR 24: 203). The fellow inmate\n\nplanned to overtake a guard, get his keys, and let appellant out of his cell. (RR 24:\n\n203).\n\n\nState’s\t\r  Rebuttal\t\r  Evidence\t\r  at\t\r  Punishment\t\r  \n\n        In appellant’s phone calls, letters, and visitation, he showed a fascination\n\nwith major criminal events that had occurred since this capital murder. (RR 25:\n\n248). He often spoke of the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting, the Sandy\n\nHook Elementary School shooting, the Boston Marathon bombing, and the DC\n\ncapital police shooting. (RR 25: 248-249). Appellant was intrigued with the\n\nnumber of casualties and the type of weapons used. (RR 25: 249). His mother\n\nonce commented that she felt sorry for the shooter in the movie theater massacre in\n\nColorado. (RR 25: 249).\n\n\n\n\n                                               38\n\f      Dr. Marisa Mauro, a licensed psychologist, interviewed appellant on\n\nFebruary 17, 2014, regarding his depression, family, substance abuse before,\n\nduring, and after this offense, prognosis for recovery from depression and\n\nsubstance abuse, and his adjustment to incarceration. (RR 26: 13-15). Appellant\n\nprovided Dr. Mauro with little information and was very emotionless. (RR 26:\n\n16). Dr. Mauro found no evidence of psychoses, and she disagreed with the\n\ndiagnosis of major depression, severe and recurrent. (RR 26: 17). Dr. Mauro\n\nopined that appellant’s alleged suicide attempt (the taking of the pills while in jail)\n\nwas more of a gesture, and the circumstances of that event raised questions for her\n\nregarding appellant’s intent of taking the pills. (RR 26: 20). After his break up\n\nwith Feland, appellant threatened to kill himself with his gun but that was only a\n\nruse to get her back. (RR 26: 24-25).\n\n      Dr. Mauro did not believe that depression impacted appellant before, during\n\nor after this capital offense. (RR 26: 31). Records also indicated that appellant\n\nsaid he made the nooses to “mess with” the jail psychiatrist and to get a cell change\n\nto a cell with a window where he could get radio reception. (RR 26: 69).\n\nAppellant displayed shockingly little difficulty adjusting to jail. (RR 26: 19). He\n\nsocialized with other inmates, engaged in daily activities with them, and even\n\ncalled them “friends.” (RR 26: 25-26, 36).\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\f        Appellant told Dr. Mauro that he had a “pretty normal” childhood with\n\ndifficult issues being his parents’ divorce, few friends, and a sometimes\n\nemotionally abusive mother. (RR 26:22-23). He reported to Dr. Mauro substantial\n\nmore drug use than documented in his records. (RR 26: 28). Appellant reported\n\nabusing substances daily and using every classification of drug, from prescription\n\npills to opium, methadone, street drugs, Ecstasy, Xanax and alcohol. (RR 26: 28).\n\nDespite appellant’s dependency on drugs and alcohol, he did not experience\n\nwithdrawal symptoms while in jail. (RR 26: 29). Dr. Mauro knew from her work\n\nin prison systems that inmates had access to narcotics “pretty much all the time”\n\nand alcohol. (RR 26: 70). Dr. Mauro testified that psychiatric medications were\n\nvaluable in prison and used for favors. (RR 26: 70).\n\n        Dr. Mauro used a psychopathy checklist to measure future dangerousness,\n\nbut she did not use that tool in this case. (RR 26: 37). The psychopathy checklist\n\ndefined asocial behaviors or not conforming to laws, violating the rights of others,\n\nhaving restricted or shallow ranged of affect and a lack of empathy, and being\n\nconning and manipulative. (RR 26: 37).\n\n\nThe\t\r  Verdict\t\r  at\t\r  the\t\r  Punishment\t\r  Phase\t\r  \n\n        The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a probability that\n\nappellant would commit criminal acts of violence and constitute a continuing threat\n\nto society. (RR 26: 216). The jury also found that there were not sufficient\n\n\n                                                   40\n\fmitigating circumstances to warrant a sentence of life imprisonment rather than a\n\ndeath sentence. (RR 26: 216). Appellant requested a jury poll, which revealed the\n\njury’s answers to the punishment verdict were unanimous. (RR 26: 217-218). In\n\naccordance with the jury’s verdict, the trial judge sentenced appellant to death by\n\nlethal injection. (RR 26: 221).\n\n\n                          SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENTS\n\nState’s\t\r  Reply\t\r  to\t\r  Appellant’s\t\r  First\t\r  Point\t\r  of\t\r  Error: Any rational jury could\n\nhave found beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a probability that the\n\nappellant would commit criminal acts of violence constituting a continuing threat\n\nto society. The direct evidence of this capital murder and the circumstances\n\nsurrounding it were highly probative of appellant’s propensity for future\n\ndangerousness. He entered the Walmart armed with a loaded firearm and\n\nmagazine, clearly intending violence. When appellant’s first shot at Officer\n\nPadron did not injure him, appellant placed the muzzle of the gun against Officer\n\nPadron’s neck, fired, and killed him. Appellant also fired at the heads of Walmart\n\nemployees who detained him.\n\n       Furthermore, appellant never showed remorse for committing this capital\n\nmurder. Instead, he was boastful and cavalier. Appellant gained self-worth from\n\ncommitting this offense and other criminal acts. He showed a life-long disrespect\n\nfor law enforcement and others. He continually committed violations while in jail\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fand planned a violent escape. Appellant’s escalating drug use and abuse was\n\nconsidered a factor in his commission of this capital murder, and appellant’s drug\n\nuse, which made him dangerous, continued while he was incarcerated.\n\n       The evidence in this case showed that prior to and after committing the\n\ncapital murder of Officer Padron appellant engaged in conduct that constituted a\n\nthreat to society. The evidence was therefore legally sufficient to sustain the jury’s\n\nverdict at punishment.\n\nState’s\t\r  Reply\t\r  to\t\r  Appellant’s\t\r  Second\t\r  Point\t\r  of\t\r  Error: Appellant’s second point\n\nof error should be overruled because appellant did not suffer any harm from the\n\ntrial court’s denial of his challenge for cause to venireperson Reading. The record\n\nreflects that appellant utilized only 14 peremptory challenges in selecting the 12\n\nmembers of the jury. Appellant utilized his fifteenth peremptory challenge to\n\nstrike a venireperson in the pool of alternates. Appellant did not request an\n\nadditional peremptory strike because he did not need one. He also did not identify\n\nan objectionable juror who sat on his jury. Under these circumstances, appellant\n\nfailed to show he suffered any harm.\n\n       Alternatively, the trial judge did not err in denying appellant’s challenge for\n\ncause to venireperson Reading. The entirety of Reading’s voir dire revealed that\n\nhe could follow the law, hold the State to its burden of proof at both phases of trial,\n\nand consider mitigating evidence. Although Reading viewed the death penalty as\n\n\n                                               42\n\fan appropriate punishment for certain murders, his voir dire reflects that he would\n\nnot automatically assess it. The record is sufficient to sustain the trial judge’s\n\nruling on appellant’s challenge for cause to Reading. Appellant’s second point of\n\nerror should be overruled on the merits as well.\n\nState’s\t\r  Reply\t\r  to\t\r  Appellant’s\t\r  Third\t\r  Point\t\r  of\t\r  Error: Appellant failed to\n\npreserve any alleged error for review. Appellant requested a hearing on Dr.\n\nMauro’s qualifications, and the trial judge granted that request. Appellant\n\nrequested to explore the basis of Dr. Mauro’s findings, and the trial judge allowed\n\nthat inquiry. There being no adverse rulings, appellant failed to preserve any\n\nalleged error for review. Moreover, appellant had no objection to Dr. Mauro’s\n\ntestimony at trial.\n\n       Additionally, the trial judge afforded appellant a proper hearing under Rule\n\n705(b). By its express terms, Rule 705(b) does not authorize inquiry into the\n\nexpert’s specific findings. It allows inquiry into the underlying basis of the\n\nexpert’s opinion, which the trial judge allowed in this case. The record reflects\n\nthat the trial judge complied with the requisites of Rule 705(b), and appellant fails\n\nto show any alleged error.\n\n       Appellant’s third point of error is wholly without merit and should be\n\noverruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 43\n\f         STATE’S REPLY TO APPELLANT’S FIRST POINT OF ERROR\n\n         The\t\r  evidence\t\r  was\t\r  legally\t\r  sufficient\t\r  to\t\r  establish\t\r  that\t\r  there\t\r  is\t\r  a\t\r  \n         probability\t\r  that\t\r  appellant\t\r  would\t\r  commit\t\r  criminal\t\r  acts\t\r  of\t\r  violence\t\r  \n         and\t\r  constitute\t\r  a\t\r  continuing\t\r  threat\t\r  to\t\r  society.\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \nStandard and Scope of Review\n\n         When reviewing the future-dangerousness special issue, the appellate court\n\nviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s finding and determines\n\nwhether a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a\n\nprobability that the appellant would commit criminal acts of violence constituting a\n\ncontinuing threat to society. Soliz v. State, 432 S.W.3d 895, 901 (Tex.Crim.App.\n\n2014). In this context, “society” includes both the free world and prison society.\n\nId., citing Druery v. State, 225 S.W.3d 491, 507 (Tex.Crim.App. 2007). The\n\nCourt's review is a very limited one. Chambers v. State, 903 S.W.2d 21, 25\n\n(Tex.Crim.App. 1995). The Court's task is to consider all of the record evidence\n\nand reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict\n\nand to determine whether, based on that evidence and those inferences, a rational\n\njury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the special issue.\n\nId.\n\n      The circumstances surrounding the offense, if severe enough, may alone be\n\nsufficient to support an affirmative answer to the future dangerousness special\n\nissue. Freeman v. State, 340 S.W.3d 717, 725 (Tex.Crim.App. 2011). Prior\n\n\n\n                                                     44\n\funadjudicated acts of violence against people and property, prior adjudicated\n\ncriminal acts, and habitual drug abuse all constitute evidence of future\n\ndangerousness. Soliz, 432 S.W.3d at 901, citing Wilkerson v. State, 881 S.W.2d\n\n321, 326 (Tex.Crim.App.), cert.denied, 513 U.S. 1060 (1994). Some factors a jury\n\nmay consider when determining whether a defendant will pose a continuing threat\n\nto society include the following:\n\n   1. the circumstances of the capital offense, including the defendant’s state of\n      mind and whether he was working alone or with other parties;\n   2. the calculated nature of the defendant’s acts;\n   3. the forethought and deliberateness exhibited by the crime’s execution;\n   4. the severity of the prior criminal acts committed by the defendant;\n   5. the defendant’s age and personal circumstances at the time of the\n      commission of the offense;\n   6. whether the defendant was acting under duress or the domination of another\n      at the time of the commission of the offense;\n   7. psychiatric evidence; and\n   8. character evidence.\n\nDevoe v. State, 354 S.W.3d 457, 461-62 (Tex.Crim.App. 2011). This list is not\n\nexclusive. Id. at 462. Further, the circumstances of the offense and the events\n\nsurrounding it can be among the most revealing evidence of future dangerousness.\n\nBell v. State, 938 S.W.2d 35, 41 (Tex.Crim.App. 1996), cert.denied, 522 U.S. 827\n\n(1997).\n\n\nApplication of Law to Facts\n\n      The direct evidence of this capital offense and the circumstances\n\nsurrounding it were highly probative evidence of appellant’s future dangerousness.\n\n\n                                         45\n\fAppellant’s actions exhibited foresight and planning. Appellant entered the\n\nWalmart armed with a loaded weapon and with the intent to shoplift. He took the\n\nloaded weapon “just in case,” clearly anticipating using violence against anyone\n\nwho interfered with his criminal endeavor. Appellant loaded the firearm with\n\nhollow point bullets to cause maximum damage to his victim(s). Along with the\n\nloaded firearm, appellant carried a magazine loaded with additional hollow point\n\nbullets, indicating his willingness to shoot and possibly kill multiple victims.\n\n      Appellant, in fact, fired his weapon multiple times. His first shot hit Officer\n\nPadron in his uniform pocket but did not injure Officer Padron because of his\n\nprotective vest. Appellant then knowingly placed the gun against Officer Padron’s\n\nneck and fired again, killing him. As Walmart employees tried to subdue\n\nappellant, he fired again, almost shooting both LeMere and Jordy in their heads.\n\nAppellant killed Officer Padron and attempted to kill Walmart employees over a\n\nmere $56.90 of shoplifted groceries. (SX78).\n\n      The jury could further infer appellant’s propensity for future dangerousness\n\nfrom evidence showing a lack of remorse. Estrada v. State, 313 S.W.3d 274, 285\n\n(Tex.Crim.App. 2010). Appellant never expressed or showed remorse for\n\ncommitting this capital murder, and he had no sympathy for his victim. Rather, he\n\nwas repeatedly cavalier and boastful. Appellant laughed after killing Officer\n\nPadron and smiled and winked at arresting officers. In jail, appellant enjoyed\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fsharing news stories about his capital murder with fellow inmates, took a bow in\n\nresponse to their applause, and pumped his fist in response to a disparaging remark\n\nregarding the police. Even appellant’s own witnesses22 testified he never\n\nexpressed remorse for this capital murder.\n\n          Appellant’s propensity for future dangerousness was supported by evidence\n\nof his long-term disrespect for law enforcement. While in jail, appellant tracked\n\nthe activities and movements of corrections officers in preparation for a violent\n\nescape from jail, which involved shooting law enforcement officers. He\n\ncommitted repeated violations of jail regulations and created a code to bypass jail\n\nsecurity with his mail. Evidence established that inmates who communicated via\n\ncoded mail presented a security threat to corrections officers, other inmates, and\n\neven the public. In just the four months preceding this capital murder, appellant\n\ncontinually committed criminal offenses, including traffic violations, possession of\n\nmarijuana and other controlled substances, possession of drug paraphernalia, DWI,\n\nand excessive drug usage. Barley v. State, 906 S.W.2d 27, 30-31 (Tex.Crim.App.\n\n1995) (explaining that even a criminal history comprised offenses that are not\n\novertly violent can lead a reasonable juror to find a probability of future\n\ndangerousness when the offenses show an escalating and ongoing pattern of\n\ndisrespect and continued violations of law).\n\n22\n     His aunt and hired psychologist Dr. Harrell.\n\n\n                                                    47\n\f      Some of the most disturbing evidence of appellant’s future dangerousness\n\nwas that he gained his self-worth from his criminal activity, in spite of being highly\n\nintelligent and having had a well-paying job. Appellant told his mother that he was\n\nat the top of the prison pecking order. The night of this capital murder, appellant\n\nwanted to commit a robbery, telling his roommate that he had gotten away with\n\n“worse shit.” Appellant saw this capital murder as an opportunity for financial\n\ngain by selling his story, which even his defense expert found disturbing. He\n\nasked his mother about murderabilia and to post him on meet-an-inmate.com,\n\ndescribing him as “bad” as possible. Appellant thought he was “cool” for owning\n\na firearm, and he bragged about eluding police on his motorcycle. And, appellant\n\nexhibited a character for violence. He was obsessed with mass murder and other\n\nviolent tragedies such as the movie theater massacre in Colorado, the Sandy Hook\n\nElementary murders, and the Boston Marathon bombing.\n\n      Appellant further displayed a lack of respect for others, even his friends. He\n\nwas manipulative, using Nikki Nance for drugs and money, despite his high-paying\n\njob. Appellant threatened to commit suicide with his firearm as a ruse to get\n\nFeland back as his girlfriend. He was polite with police officers and pleaded that\n\nhe wanted to be a “productive member of society” to get out of tickets or arrests.\n\nHe feigned suicide attempts while incarcerated to get better housing.\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\f      The substantial psychiatric evidence in this case supported the jury’s\n\ndetermination that appellant constituted a continuing threat to society. Appellant\n\ndid not like to be controlled by others and lacked empathy. He had the capacity to\n\nchange, but chose not to. Appellant’s mental health experts diagnosed appellant\n\nwith major depression, but also considered his depression a factor in his\n\ncommission of crime. The jury could infer from the evidence regarding his\n\npersonality that his character traits were consistent with the factors on the\n\npsychopathy checklist for future dangerousness.\n\n      The jury could reasonably believe that appellant’s drug use made him\n\ndangerous. Williams v. State, 273 S.W.3d 200, 214 (Tex.Crim.App. 2008);\n\nWilkerson, 881 S.W.2d at 326, (habitual drug use constitutes evidence of future\n\ndangerousness). Although intoxicated on Xanax the night he committed capital\n\nmurder, appellant planned his criminal activities at Walmart, went to the store\n\nintending to steal from the pharmacy, armed himself with a loaded firearm and\n\nmagazine, and was fully aware that he had murdered a police officer. Defense\n\nwitness Dr. Harrell thought appellant’s killing of Officer Padron was a drug-related\n\nproblem, and he testified that appellant could become dangerous and commit acts\n\nof violence in prison if he were under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The State\n\npresented evidence that prison inmates had regular access to drugs and alcohol.\n\nAnd, there was evidence that psychiatric medications were valuable in prison and\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\fcould be used for favors. Despite appellant’s escalating drug use prior to this\n\ncapital murder, he did not experience withdrawal symptoms in jail, suggesting he\n\ncontinued to abuse substances. Indeed, appellant made “hooch” while incarcerated\n\nand hoarded pills in his cell.\n\n       Appellant contends the evidence in this case is insufficient like the evidence\n\nin Berry, Beltran, and Huffman.23 Appellant’s brief at p. 17. But, these cases are\n\neasily distinguishable on their facts. In Berry, the evidence showed the defendant\n\nwas dangerous “only to those of her own children” and there was a very low\n\nprobability that she would have any more children if sentenced to life in prison.\n\n233 S.W.3d at 864. Additionally, the State in that case invited the jury to utilize an\n\nimproper standard in its consideration of future dangerousness by asking the jury\n\nto assume that the defendant would be living in the free world. Id. at 863.24 In\n\nBeltran, the Court determined the facts of that robbery-murder alone were\n\ninsufficient to sustain the future dangerousness issue, and Beltran’s prior criminal\n\nhistory reflected mostly alcohol-related offenses. 728 S.W.2d 389-90. Unlike\n\nappellant’s case, no psychiatric evidence was introduced in Beltran. 728 S.W.2d at\n\n390. In Huffman, there was no evidence that the defendant originally intended\n\n23\n  Berry v. State, 233 S.W.3d 847 (Tex.Crim.App. 2007), Beltran v. State, 728 S.W.2d 382\n(Tex.Crim.App. 1987), and Huffman v. State, 746 S.W.2d 212 (Tex.Crim.App. 1988).\n24\n  Also, it is notable that Berry was a 5-4 decision with the dissent arguing that the majority\nutilized an improper standard of review on the future dangerousness sufficiency question. 233\nS.W.3d at 865.\n\n\n\n                                               50\n\fmurder or violence in committing the robbery-murder. 746 S.W.2d at 225.\n\nHuffman committed the offense while highly intoxicated and had no memory of it.\n\nHe had only one disciplinary violation while incarcerated and that was shortly after\n\nhis arrest because he did not know where he was or why he was there. Id. at 224.\n\nAnd, the State presented no psychiatric evidence at punishment. Id. at 225.\n\n      The evidence in this case showed that prior to committing this capital\n\nmurder appellant continually engaged in conduct that constituted a threat to\n\nsociety. The killing of Officer Padron was the culmination of a life-long escalating\n\npattern of violations of the law, disrespect for law enforcement officers and other\n\ncitizens, including friends, escalating drug use and abuse, threatened violence, and\n\ndepression. The evidence at trial showed appellant continued to engage in such\n\nbehaviors even after being incarcerated for this capital murder. Based on all the\n\nevidence, the jury’s finding that there was a probability that appellant would\n\ncommit criminal acts of violence and constitute a continuing threat to society was\n\nrational. The evidence was therefore legally sufficient to sustain the jury’s answer\n\non the punishment issue. Appellant’s first point of error should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\f    STATE’S REPLY TO APPELLANT’S SECOND POINT OF ERROR\n\n      Appellant\t\r  did\t\r  not\t\r  suffer\t\r  harm\t\r  as\t\r  a\t\r  result\t\r  of\t\r  the\t\r  trial\t\r  court’s\t\r  denial\t\r  \n      of\t\r  his\t\r  challenge\t\r  for\t\r  cause\t\r  to\t\r  venireperson\t\r  Reading.\t\r  \t\r  Alternatively,\t\r  \n      the\t\r  trial\t\r  judge\t\r  did\t\r  not\t\r  err\t\r  in\t\r  denying\t\r  appellant’s\t\r  challenge\t\r  for\t\r  \n      cause\t\r  to\t\r  venireperson\t\r  Reading.\t\r  \n\n      The issue is whether the trial court’s ruling on appellant’s challenge for\n\ncause to Reading effectively deprived appellant of one of his statutorily-given\n\nperemptory challenges. Gonzales v. State, 353 S.W.3d 826, 831 (Tex.Crim.App.\n\n2011). Before harm can be shown on the record with respect to a trial court’s\n\ndenial of a defense challenge for cause, a defendant must (1) use a peremptory\n\nstrike on the challenged prospective juror; (2) exhaust his peremptory challenges;\n\nand (3) request an additional peremptory strike to use upon a specifically identified\n\nobjectionable venire member who, because the extra strike was denied, actually sat\n\non the jury. Davis v. State, 313 S.W.3d 317, 343 (Tex.Crim.App. 2010). In a\n\ndeath penalty case with only one defendant, that defendant is entitled to fifteen\n\nperemptory challenges. Art. 35.15(a), V.A.C.C.P.\n\n\nAppellant Cannot Show Harm\n\n      The State had no objections to Reading as a juror. (RR 11: 205). Appellant\n\nobjected to Reading on the basis that he had a bias toward the death penalty and\n\nthat he would require the defense to present mitigating evidence. (RR 11: 205).\n\nThe trial judge denied appellant’s challenge to Reading, and appellant exercised a\n\nperemptory challenge against Reading. (RR 11: 205; RR 16: 123-124). The\n\n                                                       52\n\fdefense utilized only 14 peremptory challenges in selecting the 12 members of the\n\njury. (RR 16: 132). The defense used its fifteenth peremptory challenge to strike a\n\nvenireperson from the pool of alternate jurors. (RR 11: 134). Cf. Comeaux v.\n\nState, 445 S.W.3d 745, 751 (Tex.Crim.App. 2014) (defendant who chooses to use\n\nperemptory strike outside strike zone may not complain about harm concerning\n\njuror within strike zone who could have been removed instead).\n\n      Appellant did not request an additional peremptory strike because it was not\n\nneeded. (RR 11: 133-134). Consequently, appellant did not identify an\n\nobjectionable juror on his jury because none sat on his jury. And, appellant did not\n\nclaim that he would have struck an alleged objectionable juror if he had had an\n\nadditional peremptory strike to use. Under these circumstances, appellant fails to\n\nshow he suffered any harm from the trial court’s denial of his challenge for cause.\n\nComeaux, 445 S.W.3d at 750. Appellant’s second point of error should be\n\noverruled on this basis.\n\n\nAlternatively, the Trial Judge Did Not Err in Denying the Challenge for\nCause\n\n      Although recognizing that he cannot show harm because he did not use all of\n\nhis peremptory challenges, appellant’s brief at pp. 18-19, appellant nevertheless\n\ncontends that the trial judge erred in denying his challenge for cause to\n\nvenireperson Reading. Appellant contends Reading was challengeable for cause\n\n\n\n                                         53\n\ffor his bias in favor of the death penalty and for his need for the defense to present\n\nmitigating evidence.\n\nFacts Relevant to the Challenge for Cause\n\n      During the State’s voir dire examination, Reading indicated that his views\n\nregarding the death penalty would not affect his ability to listen to the evidence and\n\nthe law in this case as given by the trial judge and to decide the punishment issues.\n\n(RR 11: 166). As for murder, Reading affirmatively noted that he could consider\n\nthe entire range of punishment, and he, in fact, could envision situations where the\n\nminimum and maximum punishments would be appropriate. (RR 11: 168).\n\nReading agreed with the prosecution that murder by itself was never sufficient for\n\nthe death penalty. (RR 11: 170). Reading believed capital punishment was\n\nappropriate for the capital murder of a police officer. (RR 11: 171).\n\n      Reading further understood that there were only two punishment options in a\n\ncapital murder case, and he was okay with that. (RR 11: 171-172). Reading could\n\n“absolutely” hold the State to its burden of proof of beyond a reasonable doubt and\n\nnot put any burden on the defense. (RR 11: 172). Reading understood, and\n\nagreed, that he should find the defendant “not guilty” if the State failed in its\n\nburden of proof and even if the defendant presented no evidence. (RR 11: 173).\n\n      Reading had a basic understanding of the punishment phase process in a\n\ncapital murder case regarding the special issues. (RR 11: 173-174). The\n\n\n\n                                          54\n\fprosecutor discussed the factors in the first punishment issue, viz: probability,\n\ncriminal acts of violence, and society. (RR 11: 175-179). The record reflects\n\nReading understood the issues related to those factors, the State’s continued burden\n\nof proof on those issues, and that the defendant did not have to do anything. (RR\n\n11: 175-176).\n\n      As for the mitigation issue, Reading indicated he was open to considering\n\nthat there could be mitigating evidence sufficient to choose life without parole as\n\nan appropriate punishment. (RR 11: 181). On the second punishment issue,\n\nReading could consider any mitigating evidence presented, the circumstances of\n\nthe offense, the defendant’s character and background, and the defendant’s moral\n\nculpability. (RR 11: 183-186). The prosecutor also discussed other potential\n\nmitigating factors with Reading. (RR 11: 186-188). Reading was willing to wait\n\nand hear all the evidence before making any decision about the punishment issues.\n\n(RR 11: 188).\n\n      The defense then questioned Reading. In response to a hypothetical\n\nregarding a capital murder of a police officer, Reading stated he would lean toward\n\nthe death penalty as an appropriate punishment where there were no defensive\n\nissues at guilt/innocence and where the jury has already determined the future\n\ndangerousness issue against the defendant. (RR 11: 190). Yet, Reading confirmed\n\nthat he could consider mitigating evidence. (RR 11: 191). When asked by defense\n\n\n\n                                          55\n\fcounsel if he would want the defense to bring evidence to convince him that death\n\nwas not the appropriate punishment, Reading answered affirmatively. (RR 11:\n\n191).\n\n        Further, regarding mental illness as mitigating evidence, Reading indicated\n\nthat killing a police officer was a serious offense and that it would be difficult to\n\nnot vote for the death penalty where such a murder was knowingly committed.\n\n(RR 11: 193). When asked by defense counsel to place himself on a spectrum of\n\nthe death penalty being reserved for the “worst of the worst” to being appropriate\n\nfor any murder, Reading tended to fall more toward believing the death penalty\n\nwas appropriate for any knowing and intentional murder. (RR 11: 196-197).\n\n        Reading confirmed that he could “absolutely” fairly and impartially consider\n\nall the evidence in this case, even in the punishment phase. (RR 11: 197). Reading\n\nclarified that he would not automatically lean toward the death penalty after\n\nfinding a person guilty of the capital murder of a police officer, as suggested by\n\ndefense counsel’s hypothetical, which had confused Reading. (RR 11: 197-198).\n\nAfter again discussing the defense hypothetical, Reading confirmed that he would\n\nlean toward the death penalty as the appropriate punishment where several factors\n\nwere present, to-wit: the defendant intentionally killed a police officer in the line\n\nof duty, there were no defensive issues and no mental illness issues, and the jury\n\n\n\n\n                                           56\n\fhad already found that the defendant would constitute a continuing threat to\n\nsociety. (RR 11: 199).\n\n       Finally, as to the Fifth Amendment right not to testify, Reading indicated\n\nthat he would not hold it against the defendant if he did not testify, but it would be\n\na question in his mind; i.e., why not testify and defend yourself if you are\n\ninnocent.25 (RR 11: 200). But, Reading indicated that he would do his best to put\n\nthat out of his mind if instructed by the trial judge to not consider it during\n\ndeliberations. (RR 11: 200-201). Reading confirmed for the trial judge, after\n\nhaving the instruction read to him, that he could follow the court’s instruction.\n\n(RR 11: 201-202).\n\n       The trial judge then questioned Reading. The judge determined that\n\nReading could “absolutely” consider the mitigation issue after finding that the\n\ndefendant would be a continuing threat to society. (RR 11: 202-203). The judge in\n\nfact noted that the jury only considered the second punishment issue if it had found\n\nthe first punishment in the affirmative, i.e. that the defendant would be a\n\ncontinuing threat to society. (RR 11: 202). Reading confirmed that he could\n\nconsider mitigating evidence and vote for a sentence less than death if warranted\n\nby the mitigating circumstances. (RR 11: 203).\n\n\n25\n Appellant does not contend on appeal that Reading was challengeable for cause on this basis.\nAnd, indeed he was not, given that he confirmed he could follow the law. (RR 11: 201-202).\n\n\n                                              57\n\f      The State had no objections to Reading as a juror. (RR 11: 205). Appellant\n\nobjected to Reading on the basis that he had a bias toward the death penalty and\n\nthat he would require the defense to present mitigating evidence. (RR 11: 205).\n\nThe trial judge denied appellant’s challenge to Reading, and appellant exercised a\n\nperemptory challenge against Reading. (RR 11: 205; RR 16: 123-124).\n\nStandard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n      The appellate court looks at the entire record of voir dire to determine if the\n\nevidence is sufficient to support the court’s ruling on a challenge for cause.\n\nGonzales, 353 S.W.3d at 831. The appellate court affords great deference to the\n\ntrial court’s ruling because the trial judge is present to observe the demeanor of the\n\nvenireperson and to listen to his tone of voice. Id., citing Feldman v. State, 71\n\nS.W.3d 738, 744 (Tex.Crim.App. 2002). Particular deference is afforded when the\n\nvenireperson’s answers are vacillating, unclear, or contradictory. Davis, 313\n\nS.W.3d at 344. The appellate court will reverse a trial court’s ruling on a challenge\n\nfor cause only if a clear abuse of discretion is evident. Gonzales, 353 S.W.3d at\n\n831, citing Davis, 313 S.W.3d at 344.\n\n      A venireperson is subject to a challenge for cause if he has a bias or\n\nprejudice against the defendant or against the law upon which either the State or\n\nthe defense is entitled to rely. Art. 35.16(b)(3), (c)(2), V.A.C.C.P.; Gardner v.\n\nState, 306 S.W.3d 274, 295 (Tex.Crim.App. 2009). The test is whether a\n\n\n\n                                          58\n\fvenireperson’s bias or prejudice would substantially impair his “ability to carry out\n\nhis oath and instructions in accordance with the law.” Gonzales, 353 S.W.3d at\n\n831-32, quoting Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. The proponent of the challenge for\n\ncause must establish that the challenge was proper by showing that the\n\nvenireperson understood the requirements of the law and could not sufficiently\n\novercome his prejudice to follow the law. Gonzales, 353 S.W.3d at 832. Before a\n\nvenireperson may be excused for cause on that basis, the law must be explained to\n\nhim, and he must be asked whether he can follow that law, regardless of his\n\npersonal views. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744.\n\nApplication of Law to Facts\n\n       Viewing the entirety of Reading’s voir dire examination, it is clear that the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s challenge for cause to\n\nReading. Reading did not display a determination to automatically vote for the\n\ndeath penalty, as appellant contends.26 Appellant errs in relying on only a portion\n\nof Reading’s voir dire to support his argument.\n\n       Reading agreed that capital punishment was an appropriate punishment for\n\nthe intentional murder of a police officer, but he repeatedly confirmed that he\n\n\n26\n  Appellant also argues in his brief that because Reading had a bias toward the death penalty, he\nlowered the State’s burden of proof. Appellant’s brief at p. 21. Appellant did not make this\nargument regarding the burden of proof in the trial court, so that argument is not preserved for\nappellate review. Tex.R.App.Proc. 33.1. Moreover, Reading steadfastly maintained that he\nwould hold the State to its burden of proof. See (RR 11: 172-173, 175-176).\n\n\n                                               59\n\fcould hold the State to its burden of proof on the punishment issues, consider any\n\nmitigating evidence, and follow the court’s instructions. While, in one point of his\n\nvoir dire, Reading stated that he would vote for the death penalty for the knowing\n\nmurder of a police officer, that answer was in response to a hypothetical that\n\nconfused Reading. See (RR 11: 197-198). After again discussing the defense\n\nhypothetical, Reading confirmed that he would lean toward the death penalty as the\n\nappropriate punishment where several factors were present, viz: the defendant\n\nintentionally killed a police officer in the line of duty, there were no defensive\n\nissues and no mental illness issues, and the jury had already found that the\n\ndefendant would constitute a continuing threat to society. (RR 11: 199). But, as\n\nhis voir dire indicates, he would only “lean” toward the death penalty; it was not an\n\n“automatic” assessment of death. Reading’s voir dire reflected that he deemed\n\ncapital murder an “appropriate” punishment, not an “automatic” punishment.\n\n      Furthermore, Reading’s voir dire reflects that he understood and fully\n\naccepted the State’s burden of proof at guilt/innocence and on the punishment\n\nissues. Reading confirmed he could “absolutely” hold the State to its burden of\n\nproof of beyond a reasonable doubt and not put any burden on the defense. (RR\n\n11: 172). Reading understood, and agreed, that he should find the defendant “not\n\nguilty” if the State failed in its burden of proof, even if the defendant presented no\n\nevidence. (RR 11: 172-173). As for the factors relevant to the first punishment\n\n\n\n                                          60\n\fissue, Reading understood the State’s continued burden of proof on those issues\n\nand that the defendant had no burden with regard to that issue. (RR 11: 175-176).\n\n      The State acknowledges that Reading answered affirmatively in response to\n\ndefense counsel’s question “you would want the Defense to bring you -- bring you\n\nsome evidence to convince you that death is not the appropriate sentence, correct?”\n\n(RR 11: 191). Yet, this was an isolated portion of Reading’s voir dire, and defense\n\ncounsel had not explained the burden of proof to Reading prior to this question;\n\nnor had the defense asked Reading whether he could follow the law once properly\n\nexplained to him. Gonzales, 353 S.W.3d at 832; Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744.\n\nThus, Reading was not challengeable for cause based on that single response.\n\n      Appellant’s second point of error is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n\n     STATE’S REPLY TO APPELLANT’S THIRD POINT OF ERROR\n\n      Appellant\t\r  failed\t\r  to\t\r  preserve\t\r  any\t\r  alleged\t\r  error\t\r  for\t\r  review\t\r  because\t\r  \n      there\t\r  was\t\r  no\t\r  adverse\t\r  ruling.\t\r  \t\r  Alternatively,\t\r  the\t\r  trial\t\r  court\t\r  did\t\r  not\t\r  \n      abuse\t\r  its\t\r  discretion\t\r  in\t\r  limiting\t\r  the\t\r  voir\t\r  dire\t\r  hearing\t\r  to\t\r  the\t\r  expert’s\t\r  \n      qualifications\t\r  and\t\r  the\t\r  basis\t\r  of\t\r  her\t\r  findings.\t\r  \n\nRelevant Facts\n\n      Prior to Dr. Mauro testifying for the State in rebuttal at the punishment\n\nphase, appellant requested and was granted a hearing on her qualifications. (RR\n\n26: 6). The State questioned Dr. Mauro about her educational and professional\n\nbackground. (RR 26: 6-8). Then, on his voir dire examination, appellant asked Dr.\n\n\n\n                                                     61\n\fMauro to summarize her findings regarding him. (RR 26: 8). The trial judge\n\ninterjected that the voir dire was to be on Dr. Mauro’s qualifications, and appellant\n\nagreed. (RR 26: 8-9). Appellant stated that he might want to suppress some of Dr.\n\nMauro’s findings, and he contended he had a right to question the scientific basis\n\nfor her findings. (RR 26: 9). The trial judge confirmed that appellant had the right\n\nto question Dr. Mauro about the basis of her findings and her expertise, but he did\n\nnot have the right to a hearing as to her specific findings. (RR 26: 9). Appellant\n\nrequested the opportunity to check the rule regarding his right, which the trial\n\njudge allowed. (RR 26: 9). The record reflects defense counsel conferred,\n\nproffered no further argument or objection, and then proceeded to question Dr.\n\nMauro about the basis for her findings. (RR 26: 10). After briefly questioning Dr.\n\nMauro, appellant stated he had no objection to her testimony. (RR 26: 11).\n\n\nAppellant Failed to Preserve Any Alleged Error for Review\n\n      Appellant initially requested a hearing outside the jury’s presence on Dr.\n\nMauro’s qualifications, and the trial judge granted him that hearing. (RR 26: 6).\n\nWhen appellant asked Dr. Mauro about her specific findings, the trial judge\n\ninterjected that the purpose of the hearing was to examine Dr. Mauro’s\n\nqualifications. (RR 26: 8). Appellant agreed. (RR 26: 9). But, appellant\n\ncontended he had “the right to question whether there is a scientific basis to her\n\n\n\n\n                                         62\n\ffindings prior to her testifying about those findings.” 27 (RR 26: 9). The trial judge\n\nagreed that appellant could ask Dr. Mauro about the basis of her findings but\n\nwithout going into her specific findings. (RR 26: 9). Appellant requested to check\n\nthe rule, which the trial judge allowed. (RR 26: 9). Appellant proceeded with the\n\nhearing without any further objection or request to query Dr. Mauro on her specific\n\nfindings. There being no adverse rulings, appellant failed to present any alleged\n\nerror for review. Tex.R.App.Proc. 33.1(a); Fuller v. State, 253 S.W.3d 220, 232\n\n(Tex.Crim.App. 2008), cert.denied, 555 U.S. 1105 (2009). Moreover, appellant\n\nhad no objection to Dr. Mauro’s testimony at trial. Therefore, no alleged error is\n\npreserved for review. Tex.R.App.Proc. 33.1. Appellant’s third point of error\n\nshould be overruled on procedural default grounds.\n\n\nThe Trial Judge Afforded Appellant a Proper Rule 705(b) Hearing\n\n       Texas Rule of Evidence 705(b) provides:\n\n       Voir Dire. Prior to the expert giving the expert’s opinion or disclosing the\n       underlying facts or data, a party against whom the opinion is offered upon\n       request in a criminal case shall, or in a civil case may, be permitted to\n       conduct a voir dire examination directed to the underlying facts or data upon\n       which the opinion is based. This examination shall be conducted out of the\n       hearing of the jury.\n\nUnder this rule, a defendant is entitled upon a timely request to conduct a voir dire\n\nexamination directed to the underlying facts or data upon which the opinion of an\n\n27\n  A request to take a witness on voir dire to prove up her expert qualifications does not\nconstitute a request for a Rule 705(b) hearing to inquire into the “underlying facts or data” of the\nexpert’s opinion. Jenkins v. State, 912 S.W.2d 793, 814 (Tex.Crim.App. 1995) (op. on reh’g.).\n\n                                                 63\n\fexpert witness is based. Alba v. State, 905 S.W.2d 581, 587 (Tex.Crim.App.\n\n1995), cert.denied, 516 U.S. 1077 (1996). The trial court must allow this\n\nexamination to be conducted outside the hearing of the jury and prior to the expert\n\ntestifying to her opinion before the jury. Id. at 587-88. The purpose of Rule\n\n705(b) is to give defense counsel the “opportunity to determine the foundation of\n\nthe expert’s opinion without fear of eliciting damaging hearsay or other\n\ninadmissible evidence in the jury’s presence.” Id. at 588, citing Goss v. State, 826\n\nS.W.2d 162, 168 (Tex.Crim.App. 1992), cert.denied, 113 S.Ct. 3035 (1993).\n\n      Appellant contends the trial court erred in not allowing him to question Dr.\n\nMauro about her specific findings in the voir dire hearing on her qualifications. By\n\nits express terms, Rule 705(b) does not authorize inquiry into the expert’s specific\n\nfindings. It allows inquiry into the underlying basis of the expert’s opinion, which\n\nthe trial judge allowed in this case. The record reflects that the trial judge\n\ncomplied with the requisites of Rule 705(b), and appellant fails to show any\n\nalleged error.\n\n      Appellant’s third point of error is wholly without merit and should be\n\noverruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          64\n\f                                      PRAYER\n\n      WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the State prays this Court to\n\noverrule the appellant’s points of error and to affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n                                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                ROSEMARY LEHMBERG\n                                                District Attorney\n                                                Travis County, Texas\n\n\n                                                /s/ Lisa Stewart\n                                                Lisa Stewart\n                                                Assistant District Attorney\n                                                State Bar No. 06022700\n                                                P.O.

D-1-DC-12-201718\n\nTO THE HONORABLE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS:\n\n      Now comes the State of Texas and files its brief in response to that of the\n\nappellant.\n\n\n                         STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n\n      The State indicted appellant for the capital murder of Austin Police Officer\n\nJaime Padron. (CR 98, 100). The jury found appellant guilty of capital murder as\n\nalleged in the indictment. (CR 184). The trial court sentenced appellant to death\n\nbased on the jury’s answers to the punishment issues. (CR 189; RR 26: 221).\n\nAppellant timely filed a motion for new trial, which was overruled by operation of\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\flaw. (CR 196). Although appeal to this Court is automatic, the appellant timely\n\nfiled notice of appeal. (CR 197). Art. 37.071(h), V.A.C.C.P.\n\n\n                  STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n         The issues presented in this case are not issues of first impression but\n\ninvolve the application of facts to well-settled law. Thus, the State does not\n\nrequest oral argument in this case, as it would not significantly aid the Court in the\n\nresolution of the issues presented in this appeal.\n\n\n               STATEMENT OF FACTS FROM GUILT/INNOCENCE\n\nFacts\t\r  of\t\r  this\t\r  Capital\t\r  Murder\t\r  Committed\t\r  at\t\r  an\t\r  Austin\t\r  Walmart\t\r  \n\n         In the early hours1 of April 6, 2012, Walmart employee Sean McCarthy\n\nencountered appellant2 while restocking water in the store. (RR 18: 21). Appellant\n\nasked McCarthy to hold his produce bags, and appellant left the store to obtain\n\nsomething. (RR 18: 22-24). Appellant looked “like he had a rough night,” but\n\nMcCarthy did not feel threatened by him. (RR 18: 23). Walmart retail manager\n\nLincoln LeMere called 3113 because appellant appeared intoxicated, and LeMere\n\nfeared he would be a danger to himself and others. (RR 18: 54).\n\n\n\n1\n    The time was approximately midnight to 1 a.m. (RR 18: 24).\n2\n    McCarthy identified appellant in the courtroom. (RR 18: 32-34).\n3\n    The call was transferred to 911. (RR 18: 54).\n\n\n                                                    6\n\f       Austin Police Officer Jaime Padron responded to the call, and he and\n\nLeMere entered the store and encountered appellant. (RR 18: 58-59, 177, 179).\n\nOfficer Padron announced that he was with the Austin Police Department and told\n\nappellant to stop. (RR 18: 59-60, 132). Appellant lowered his shoulder, ducked\n\naway from Officer Padron, and ran for the exit. (RR 18: 59). Officer Padron gave\n\nchase and tackled appellant from behind. (RR 18: 60). Walmart employee Monica\n\nLawson saw appellant pull a gun from his waistband as Officer Padron attempted\n\nto subdue appellant and take his gun. (RR 18: 95-96). As Officer Padron tackled\n\nappellant, LeMere heard a gunshot, and he heard an additional gunshot when\n\nappellant and Officer Padron fell to the ground. (RR 18: 60-61, 63). Lawson’s co-\n\nworker, Alma Ramirez, testified that she saw appellant put the gun to Officer\n\nPadron’s neck and shoot him. (RR 18: 119-120).\n\n       LeMere realized appellant had a gun when he saw Officer Padron “bleeding\n\nout.” (RR 18: 61). LeMere immediately jumped on appellant who raised his arm\n\nand fired a third shot, which just missed LeMere’s right ear and night manager\n\nArchie Jordy’s left ear.4 (RR 18: 61, 133-134). LeMere felt that that third shot\n\nwas meant for him. (RR 18: 62).\n\n\n\n\n4\n Jordy had followed appellant through the store because he suspected he was going to shoplift,\nbut appellant did not appear armed. (RR 18: 56, 129, 153).\n\n\n                                               7\n\f       LeMere pushed appellant’s arm to the ground, and McCarthy and Jordy\n\nstomped on appellant’s arm, making him release the gun, and kicked the gun aside.\n\n(RR 18: 62). Appellant raised his head from the floor, looked at Officer Padron,\n\n“kind of laughed, chuckled and said, I killed a cop.” (RR 18: 64, 151). Officer\n\nPadron never pulled a weapon of any kind when chasing appellant. (RR 18: 98).\n\n       It was obvious to the various Walmart employees5 that Padron was a police\n\nofficer because of his uniform, “all the gadgets,” and his apparent fitness. (RR 18:\n\n38). Officer Padron was wearing a full Austin Police Department uniform. (RR\n\n18: 38, 56). Officer Padron had not removed his gun from his gun belt. (RR 18:\n\n64). The security hood on Officer Padron’s holster was still in the locked position\n\nwith his gun inside the holster. (RR 18: 204-205).\n\n       Walmart employees tried to keep Officer Padron alive while police arrived\n\nat the scene and handcuffed appellant. (RR 18: 35). Will Garlow removed his\n\nshirt and applied pressure to Officer Padron’s neck until the squirting blood\n\nstopped. (RR 18: 166-167). Garlow talked to Officer Padron and attempted to\n\nkeep him awake. But, Officer Padron never responded verbally, and he barely\n\nfocused his eyes. (RR 18: 166, 167-168). Garlow and Austin police officer Chris\n\nKroger attempted to clear Officer Padron’s airway, but it was too late, as Officer\n5\n  Walmart employees Monica Lawson, Alma Ramirez, and William Garlow all immediately\nrecognized that Officer Padron was a police officer because of his uniform and badge. (RR 18:\n94, 118-119, 162). Austin police officer Steve Martinez was in full uniform during trial and\ndisplayed it for the jury since Officer Padron had worn the same type uniform. (RR 18: 217).\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fPadron had bled out. (RR 18: 167, 181). EMS pronounced Officer Padron dead at\n\nthe scene. (RR 18: 205).\n\n\nEvidence\t\r  Recovered\t\r  After\t\r  Appellant\t\r  Taken\t\r  into\t\r  Custody\t\r  \n\n       Austin police officers removed appellant from the Walmart and searched\n\nhim for additional weapons. (RR 18: 235). Police found a magazine with six .380\n\nhollow point bullets6 in appellant’s pocket. (RR 19: 34). Homicide Detective\n\nBrett Bailey collected the appellant’s firearm at the scene.7 (RR 19: 64). The\n\nfirearm, a Jimenez Arms .380, still contained the magazine in the grip of the\n\nweapon. (RR 19: 65; SX49). The firearm had one live .380 cartridge in the\n\nchamber and one in the magazine. (RR 19: 65-66; SX27). Thus, when Detective\n\nBailey found the firearm, it was capable of firing two more rounds. (RR 19: 66).\n\nFirearms examination determined that the three casings found at the scene had all\n\nbeen fired from appellant’s gun. (RR 20: 145-146).\n\n       Police also searched the backpack appellant had with him and found Reese’s\n\nPeanut Butter ice cream bars, Little Debbie Oatmeal Crème Pies, three bags of\n\npeanuts, filet mignon steaks, beef jerky, Hostess CupCakes, and two bottles of\n\n\n6\n  Detective Bailey testified that hollow point bullets typically cause more damage upon impact\nthan lead ball ammunition. (RR 19: 62).\n7\n State’s exhibit 62 reflected appellant purchased this weapon on February 23, 2009, in Fort\nCollins, Colorado. (RR 20: 60-61). State’s exhibit 62 was admitted into evidence without\nobjection. (RR 20: 60).\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fKorbel Champagne. (RR 18: 235; RR 22: 57). Appellant had killed Officer\n\nPadron over $56.90 worth of shoplifted items. (RR 22: 62; SX78).8\n\n       Upon being taken into custody, appellant asked Austin police officer Albert\n\nArevalo9 questions regarding the county of the offense, the relative leniency of\n\nTravis County versus Williamson County, and if he would get life or death for\n\nwhat he had done. (RR 18: 245). Appellant winked and smiled at Officer Arevalo\n\nas he put him in a patrol car. (RR 18: 243). Officer Arevalo noticed that appellant\n\nhad red, watery eyes and slurred speech and seemed sleepy. (RR 18: 248). Yet,\n\nappellant was alert and oriented according to EMS protocol and politely answered\n\nquestions. (RR 18: 222). Appellant confirmed that he had no injuries or medical\n\nproblems, although he did have “blow back” blood on his face from Officer\n\nPadron’s fatal injury. (RR 18: 222; RR 19: 37-38; SX7). Appellant also told EMS\n\ntechnicians that he had not consumed any alcohol or drugs. (RR 18: 222).\n\nAppellant asked EMS technician Christopher Lester if he was going to get life in\n\nprison for “this.” (RR 18: 223). Appellant showed no emotion; he was “very\n\nblank, very cold.” (RR 18: 224).\n\n\n\n\n8\n The evidence of the specific food items and the total coast thereof was admitted at the\npunishment phase. (RR 22: 57, 62).\n9\n  Officer Arevalo spelled his name for the court reporter as “Arevalo,” but it is recorded in the\nrecord as “Arevelo.” (RR 18: 238). The State uses the spelling of the name as dictated into the\nrecord by the officer.\n\n                                                10\n\f      During transport to police headquarters, appellant talked to himself and\n\nmade a comment about “blasting” one of the officers in the car. (RR 19: 39, 45;\n\nSX15). At headquarters, appellant saw an old police department motorcycle that\n\nhe thought was cool, and he spontaneously admitted “I killed a cop.” (RR 18: 248-\n\n249; RR 19: 113). Appellant spoke matter of factly, without emotion. (RR 19:\n\n114). Later, when a nurse drew appellant’s blood pursuant to a warrant at the\n\nTravis County Jail, appellant chuckled, looked at his hands, and said “I guess I got\n\nthat cop’s blood on my hands.” (RR 19: 98-99). Appellant, indeed, had blood on\n\nhis hands. (RR 19: 98).\n\n      Appellant waived his Miranda rights and spoke with police. (RR 19: 117-\n\n118). The State played appellant’s recorded interrogation for the jury. (RR 19:\n\n142; SX59). Appellant appeared cognizant of his actions, used appropriate\n\nterminology, and did not present any indication of mental illness or lack of mental\n\nfitness. (RR 19: 119). Appellant admitted to have recently taken Xanax, but he did\n\nnot seem intoxicated. (RR 19: 120). Appellant knew every single detail involving\n\nhis murder of Officer Padron, including that he held his gun against Officer\n\nPadron’s skin. (RR 19: 131; RR 20: 57). He knew that he shot an Austin Police\n\nOfficer, and he admitted numerous times that he was the one who shot Officer\n\nPadron. (RR 20: 57).\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\fForensic\t\r  Evidence\t\r  \n\n       DNA testing confirmed the presence of Officer Padron’s DNA profile on\n\nappellant’s right hand. (RR 20: 84). Forensic testing of appellant’s blood showed\n\nno alcohol in his blood but revealed a high level of alprazolam (aka Xanax) and\n\nmarijuana. (RR 20: 89, 93-94, 100). Text messages recovered from appellant’s\n\ncell phone revealed that on April 4, 2012, appellant arranged for the purchase of\n\neight bars of Xanax and that, the next day, he increased that purchase request to ten\n\nbars. (RR 20: 24). Police executed a search warrant on appellant’s apartment and\n\ndiscovered sticky notes reading “stop fucking yourself up” and “when I rise to\n\npower, you will be sterilized.” (RR 20: 29-30, 32).\n\n\nEvidence\t\r  from\t\r  Officer\t\r  Padron’s\t\r  Autopsy\t\r  \n\n       Officer Padron suffered a gunshot wound to his neck, with the entrance\n\nwound under the left side of his neck (SX65) and the exit wound in the back right\n\nof his neck (SX66). (RR 20: 111). This gunshot travelled through Officer\n\nPadron’s voice box, fractured his fifth cervical vertebra (neck bone), and damaged\n\ntwo arteries that carried blood to his brain. (RR 20: 113). This gunshot created a\n\nlarge tear in the right common carotid artery and tore apart the vertebral artery.\n\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f(RR 20: 113-114). The gunshot injuries to these arteries caused rapid\n\nhemorrhaging and were fatal.10 (RR 20: 116-118).\n\n       Black gunpowder soot encircled the entrance wound on Officer Padron’s\n\nneck, confirming appellant placed the gun against his skin when he fired. (RR 20:\n\n122). The muzzle of the gun actually made contact with Officer Padron’s skin,\n\nleaving a muzzle imprint. (RR 20: 123). The medical examiner had no doubt that\n\nappellant pressed the gun barrel up against Officer Padron’s neck when he shot\n\nhim. (RR 20: 124). The overall path of the bullet was front to back and to the\n\nright. (RR 20: 114).\n\n       Appellant had also shot Officer Padron in the chest through the right breast\n\npocket of his uniform. (RR 20: 112). But, Officer Padron had been wearing an\n\narmored vest so he did not suffer any damage to his body from this gunshot. (RR\n\n20: 112). Firearms examination revealed that the distance of the gun’s muzzle to\n\nOfficer Padron’s uniform was less than 14 inches. (RR 20: 149).\n\n\nOfficer\t\r  Padron’s\t\r  Personal\t\r  and\t\r  Professional\t\r  Background\t\r  \n\n       Officer Padron grew up near San Angelo, Texas. (RR 20: 170). After\n\ngraduating high school in 1989, he joined the Marines and did a tour in Desert\n\nStorm, the first Gulf War. (RR 20: 170-171). He received many commendations\n\n\n10\n  The medical examiner confirmed that hollow point bullets cause more damage to a person’s\nbody than lead filled bullets. (RR 20: 116).\n\n\n                                             13\n\fwhile in the Marines and an honorable discharge. (RR 20: 171). After serving\n\nfour years in the Marines, Officer Padron became a corrections officer and then a\n\npolice officer, fulfilling a life-long dream. (RR 20: 172).\n\n      Officer Padron was a servant in his church, in his community, and for his\n\ncountry. (RR 20: 172). Officer Padron served 14 years with the City of San\n\nAngelo Police Department and became a detective. (RR 20: 173). He also worked\n\nwith middle school students in San Angelo and had a positive impact on their lives,\n\nleading students to become Marines or police officers. (RR 20: 173-174).\n\n      Supporting his wife’s career choice, Officer Padron moved to Austin with\n\nhis family. (RR 20: 175). He became a patrol officer with the Austin Police\n\nDepartment, and he was very happy. (RR 20: 175). Officer Padron’s brother had\n\noffered him a more lucrative job in San Angelo, but Officer Padron declined it\n\nbecause he loved being a police officer and being in Austin with his two young\n\ndaughters. (RR 20: 176).\n\n      At the time of his murder, Officer Padron was planning his life with a new\n\ngirlfriend. (RR 20: 178). He and his girlfriend were looking for a home with\n\nproperty for horses, which he loved. (RR 20: 178). But, the “world turned to a\n\nvery ugly place” for the Padron family the day their son and brother was killed.\n\n(RR 20: 181). After a funeral in Austin, the family took Officer Padron back home\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fto San Angelo. (RR 20: 181). The City of San Angelo dedicated a park in Officer\n\nPadron’s honor. (RR 20: 181-182).\n\n\nDefense\t\r  Evidence\t\r  at\t\r  Guilt/Innocence\t\r  \t\r  \n\n       Jenna Feland dated appellant from July of 2008, till December of 2011,\n\nwhen he ended the relationship. (RR 20: 185). Appellant used drugs while the\n\ncouple lived in Colorado, mostly using marijuana, but he also did mushrooms,\n\nacid, and Ecstasy. (RR 20: 189-190). In fact, appellant took Ecstasy daily. (RR\n\n20: 190).\n\n       Feland claimed that appellant did not do well after their break up, and\n\nappellant told Feland he was really sad and “in a downward spiral.” (RR 20: 12).\n\nAppellant started drinking and taking Xanax. (RR 20: 193). Despite the alleged\n\ndownward spiral, appellant had a new girlfriend, Nikki Nance, that same\n\nDecember, and he and Feland barely had contact prior to this offense. (RR 20:\n\n206, 231-232).\n\n       Feland confirmed that appellant did not have a mental illness. (RR 20: 207).\n\nBy impeaching Feland with her grand jury testimony, the State established that\n\nappellant was not generally a depressed person and that Feland was not aware of\n\nappellant having mental problems. (RR 20: 228, 234). Feland described appellant\n\nas a quiet and reserved person who got depressed when he got in trouble. (RR 20:\n\n234-235).\n\n\n                                                15\n\f      On cross-examination, the State also established that Feland and appellant\n\ndiscussed him selling his story for $100,000, although she denied it at trial. (RR\n\n20: 200). State’s exhibit 71, a videotaped recording of Feland visiting appellant in\n\njail on April 24, 2012, showed appellant had the idea to sell his story of this capital\n\nmurder, and Feland laughed throughout the video. (RR 20: 214; RR 23: 76).\n\nAlso, while in jail, appellant created a secret code so that he and Feland could\n\ncommunicate without law enforcement understanding what they had written. (RR\n\n20: 215).\n\n      Dr. Matthew Masters, an addiction medicine practitioner, reviewed multiple\n\nevidentiary items from the defense in preparation for his trial testimony. (RR 21:\n\n18). Dr. Masters testified that Xanax was a highly addictive drug and the number\n\none benzodiazepine on the street because it was fast-acting. (RR 21: 5, 11-12). Dr.\n\nMasters observed appellant on the crime scene video at Walmart, and the manner\n\nin which appellant exited his motorcycle was consistent with a person intoxicated\n\nby a benzodiazepine. (RR 21: 19). The SWIFS lab report showed appellant had\n\ntoxic levels of alprazolam in his system seven hours after his arrest, and his\n\ntoxicity level was consistent with having taken 8 to 10 Xanax pills. (RR 21: 20-\n\n21). Thus, Dr. Masters opined that appellant’s statement to police the night of the\n\noffense was totally unreliable due to confabulation. (RR 21: 23-24). Dr. Masters\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fdescribed appellant as an addict based on his history, his behavior, and his lab\n\nreports. (RR 21: 27).\n\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Masters confirmed that prior to April 2012 he had\n\nnot treated appellant or seen him in a professional manner. (RR 21: 33). Dr.\n\nMasters conducted only a diagnostic evaluation based on what appellant told him,\n\nwhat the defense provided him, and the grand jury testimony of appellant’s new\n\ngirlfriend. (RR 21: 33). Dr. Masters did not consult any members of appellant’s\n\nfamily or a psychiatrist appellant had previously seen11, and Dr. Masters was not a\n\npsychiatrist. (RR 21: 34). Dr. Masters had not seen the crime scene videotape to\n\nknow that appellant’s statement to police was consistent with that tape, thus\n\nundermining his opinion that appellant’s statement was due to confabulation. (RR\n\n21: 38). Appellant’s statement in the police car that he killed a police officer also\n\nrebutted Dr. Masters’ assessment of confabulation. (RR 21: 38-39).\n\n       After approximately one hour of deliberations, the jury found appellant\n\nguilty of capital murder as alleged in the indictment. (RR 21: 99, 101).\n\n\n\n\n11\n  At punishment it was revealed that appellant self-reported that he had seen a psychiatrist in\nsixth grade, but there was no evidence of the alleged doctor’s name or a diagnosis. (RR 24: 155-\n156).\n\n\n                                              17\n\f             STATEMENT OF FACTS FROM PUNISHMENT PHASE\n\nThe\t\r  Night\t\r  of\t\r  this\t\r  Capital\t\r  Murder\t\r  Offense\t\r  \n\n        Appellant and his roommate Kelvin Davis12 drank and smoked marijuana\n\nthe night leading to the murder of Officer Padron. (RR 22: 123). Appellant drank\n\ntequila, at least a half a liter of it, and Davis drank rum. (RR 22: 124, 145-146).\n\nAppellant also took Xanax; in fact, he took approximately six pills, more than\n\nDavis thought appellant could handle. (RR 22: 125). That evening, Davis and\n\nappellant walked to a nearby convenience store, and appellant talked about robbing\n\nthe store. (RR 22: 127-128). Davis tried to downplay appellant’s idea to rob the\n\nstore because appellant didn’t need any further legal troubles. (RR 22: 128).\n\nAppellant responded that he had gotten “away with worse shit.” (RR 22: 128-129).\n\n\nLack\t\r  of\t\r  Remorse\t\r  and\t\r  Extraneous\t\r  Bad\t\r  Acts\t\r  in\t\r  Texas\t\r  \n\n        Officer Cory Knop transported appellant from the Walmart to the Austin\n\nPolice Department that fateful day. (RR 22: 18). Appellant nonchalantly admitted\n\nthat he killed a cop. (RR 22: 19). Appellant also asked Officer Knop if he\n\nremembered him, which Officer Knop did. Officer Knop met appellant February\n\n2, 2012, when he arrested him for driving while intoxicated. (RR 22: 19-20).\n\nOfficer Knop conducted field sobriety tests on appellant and transported him to\n\n\n12\n  In January of 2012, Davis searched for a roommate in Austin on Craigslist and found\nappellant. (RR 22: 116).\n\n\n\n                                                      18\n\fjail, all of which was videotaped. (RR 22: 21; SX72). During the DWI encounter,\n\nappellant volunteered that he had worked multiple times as an informant for the\n\npolice in Colorado. (RR 22: 27). Appellant asked Officer Knop not to impound\n\nhis vehicle and if there were anything he could do to help appellant with the\n\ncharges. (RR 22: 28). Appellant pleaded that he was a productive member of\n\nsociety and not a bad guy. (RR 22: 28-29). Appellant asked Officer Knop if he\n\nthought the arrest was right and if he ever felt bad or if he had done the wrong\n\nthing. (RR 22: 29-30). Appellant was polite and did not seem threatening to\n\nOfficer Knop. (RR 22: 22-23). But, appellant was also polite the night he\n\nmurdered Officer Padron. (RR 22: 23).\n\n      About five weeks earlier, on December 27, 2011, DPS Trooper Charles\n\nHoover stopped appellant for speeding on a highway between Amarillo and\n\nLubbock. (RR 22: 167-168). The odor of marijuana from appellant’s vehicle was\n\nquite strong, and Trooper Hoover found marijuana in appellant’s vehicle and\n\narrested him. (RR 22: 169, 171). Trooper Hoover seized from appellant’s vehicle\n\na grinder, marijuana pipe, and three pill bottles for prescription marijuana from\n\nColorado that were not in appellant’s name. (RR 22: 174-175; SX81, 82).\n\nVideotaped evidence from this arrest showed appellant was very compliant with\n\nthe officer and stated that he wanted to be a productive member of society. (RR\n\n22: 168-169, 173; SX80).\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f      Austin Police Detective Roy Rector was a certified forensics examiner, and\n\nhe analyzed evidence from two computers seized after appellant’s arrest for\n\nmurdering Officer Padron. (RR 22: 44). Rector retrieved four photographs\n\n(SX73-76) from the logical path Users\\danielbra\\documents\\MY\n\nBACKUP\\JENNA BACKUP\\Pictures. (RR 22: 45-48). The file was created May,\n\n26, 2011, but the pictures were taken in March and May of 2009, all by the same\n\ncamera. (RR 22: 46-47). The pictures (SX 73-76) were of appellant’s tattooed\n\narm holding a gun and of a bullet hole in a wall. (RR 22: 45, 47; RR 23: 72;\n\nSX83). Nikki Nance had seen appellant’s gun approximately ten times; appellant\n\nthought having a gun looked “cool.” (RR 22: 95-96). Appellant also bragged to\n\nNance that he would drive really fast on his motorcycle and that he had outrun the\n\npolice in Colorado. (RR 22: 97).\n\n      Kristina “Nikki” Nance testified for the State with a testimonial immunity\n\nagreement. (RR 22: 87). In late 2011 or early 2012, appellant met Nance through\n\na posting on Craigslist. (RR 22: 89). They used lots of drugs, to-wit: Xanax,\n\ncocaine, acid, mushrooms, and Ecstasy, most of which appellant purchased for\n\nthem. (RR 22: 90-91). As Nance’s and appellant’s relationship continued, their\n\ndrug usage increased. (RR 22: 101-102). Appellant began using heavier drugs and\n\nmixing them. (RR 22: 102). Nance recalled a time when appellant wanted to find\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\fan “eight ball” of cocaine. (RR 22: 92). Appellant tried to get his roommate Davis\n\nto do cocaine, but he refused. (RR 22: 119-120).\n\n       Nance’s and appellant’s friendship ended when she fronted him $600 to\n\npurchase drugs, and he never paid her back even though he made a lot more money\n\nthan Nance did and made her late on her rent. (RR 22: 93-94, 95). Appellant once\n\ntold Davis that he would kill Nikki Nance if she damaged his car. (RR 22: 132).\n\nYet, appellant did not seem psychotic or violent to Davis, even when appellant\n\nused drugs. (RR 22: 132-133).\n\n       Appellant seemed intelligent to Davis. (RR 22: 132). Appellant never\n\ndiscussed any family issues with his mother or father and never lamented a bad\n\nchildhood. (RR 22: 133). Appellant told Davis about outrunning the police on his\n\nmotorcycle. (RR 22: 129).\n\n       While in the Del Valle jail after his arrest for this capital murder, appellant\n\nmet inmate Luis Escalante because Escalante was curious about the jail uniform13\n\nappellant was wearing. (RR 23: 33). Appellant asked Escalante if he had seen the\n\nperson on the news who had killed the cop at Walmart. (RR 23: 34). Appellant\n\nshowed Escalante a picture of himself from the newspaper, and appellant smirked\n\nand chuckled about the killing. (RR 23: 35). Escalante asked appellant if he had\n\n\n13\n  Escalante explained that persons wearing the orange and white stripes are “high felons,”\npersons who committed aggravated crimes or murders. (RR 23: 33).\n\n\n\n                                               21\n\fany remorse for the killing or sympathy for his victim, and appellant shook his\n\nhead “no.” (RR 23: 36).\n\n       Appellant admitted to Escalante that he grabbed Officer Padron by the neck\n\nand shot him and that he fired several times. (RR 23: 52-53). Appellant claimed\n\nhe went to Walmart to get pills “to get his mind right.” (RR 23: 53). He had\n\nplanned to rob the Walmart pharmacy but not harm the police officer. (RR 23: 54).\n\nAppellant also told Escalante that Officer Padron told him he was taking him in\n\nbecause he was intoxicated. (RR 23: 54-55).\n\n\nExtraneous\t\r  Bad\t\r  Acts\t\r  Committed\t\r  in\t\r  Colorado\t\r  \n\n       On January 25, 2007, Shawn Wycoff of the Colorado State Patrol clocked\n\nappellant going 80 m.p.h. in a 55 m.p.h. speed zone on his “highlighter green”\n\nmotorcycle. (RR 23: 8-9. 11). Wycoff attempted to pull over appellant for\n\nspeeding, but appellant accelerated and fled, making numerous lane changes and\n\nreaching speeds of 90-95 m.p.h. (RR 23: 9, 14). Wycoff radioed another trooper\n\nfor assistance who was able to stop appellant. (RR 23: 10-11). Appellant\n\npresented his driver’s license for identification, but he did not have an endorsement\n\nallowing him to drive a motorcycle. (RR 23: 11). The trooper arrested appellant\n\nfor improper endorsement on his license, eluding a police officer, and possession\n\nof marijuana, which the trooper found in appellant’s pants pocket. (RR 23: 12-13).\n\nAppellant admitted that he was out joyriding, racing a friend on the interstate, and\n\n\n                                               22\n\fhe fled from police because he didn’t want to get caught, lose his license, or lose\n\nhis motorcycle, which was without plates. (RR 23: 12).\n\n        In April of 2012, Caresa Marino, a patrol officer in Cheyenne, Wyoming,\n\nsaw a news report about appellant killing Officer Padron. (RR 23: 19-20).\n\nMarino’s immediate reaction was “wow, I know that kid. He threatened me in the\n\nsixth grade.” (RR 23: 20). Marino was not surprised to see appellant on the news.\n\n(RR 23: 20).\n\n        Marino and appellant attended school together in Parker, Colorado. (RR 23:\n\n21). In November of 1999, appellant threatened Marino when she was playing\n\nsoccer with her friends at recess. (RR 23: 22, 24). Totally unprovoked, appellant\n\nran up to Marino, told her to lock her doors and windows because he was going to\n\ngo to her house and rape her. (RR 23: 22). Appellant also called Marino a “bitch”\n\nand a “fucker.” (RR 23: 22). Appellant and his friends claimed he was just joking,\n\nbut Marino did not find it funny. (RR 23: 27, 28).\n\n\nExtraneous\t\r  Bad\t\r  Acts\t\r  and\t\r  Disciplinary\t\r  Violations\t\r  in\t\r  Jail\t\r  \n\n        On May 20, 2012, appellant reported to corrections officer Farial Garrie in\n\nthe maximum security section of the Del Valle jail that he had found a bunch of\n\ngreen and orange pills in the jail dayroom and that he had taken them in a suicide\n\nattempt. (RR 22: 149-151). Appellant was transported to Brackenridge Hospital\n\nfor the apparent suicide attempt. (RR 23: 74). The physician’s summary reflected\n\n\n                                                   23\n\fthat appellant claimed to have taken a bag of pills he found taped under a chair.\n\n(RR 23: 74; SX84). The records further reflected that appellant decompensated in\n\nthe emergency room and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. (RR 23:\n\n75). But, appellant’s urine and serum drug screens were negative. (RR 23: 75).14\n\nFurthermore, corrections officers had searched the dayroom before allowing\n\ninmates into it, and they had not found any pills. (RR 22: 152-153).\n\n       Corrections officers searched appellant’s cell thereafter and found a strip of\n\npaper with a key to decipher coded messages from appellant. (RR 22: 162-163).\n\nCorrections officers found further evidence that appellant intended to bypass jail\n\nsecurity by sending the coded paper to his mother through correspondence to his\n\nattorney. (RR 22: 163).\n\n       In June of 2012, appellant was housed in a psychiatric observation cell in the\n\nDel Valle jail. (RR 22: 64). On June 3, 2012, corrections officer Dustin Rade\n\nsearched appellant’s cell for contraband and found hooch, ingredients for an\n\nintoxicating beverage, hidden behind the toilet. (RR 22: 65-66). Appellant\n\nviolated jail rules by possessing the hooch. (RR 22: 67). Officer Rade again found\n\ncontraband items in appellant’s cell on August 17, 2012. (RR 22: 68). Officer\n\nRade found six pills hidden in the window ledge. (RR 22: 68-69). Appellant\n14\n   During the defense presentation of evidence at the punishment phase, Dr. Harold Scott\ntestified that, from his review of appellant’s medical records, he believed appellant took an\noverdose of Haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug. (RR 25: 168, 173). Haloperidol was the generic\nversion of Haldol, the most common psychological drug in an institutional setting. (RR 25: 168,\n173). Dr. Scott testified that the hospital did not screen for Haldol. (RR 25: 172).\n\n                                              24\n\fviolated jail rules by possessing the pills, which could only be prescribed by\n\nmedical staff. (RR 22: 70). Appellant also kept in his cell a list with the jailers’\n\nnames and their routines and activities. The list of names contained various\n\ndescriptions of the officers, e.g., appellant said Officer Rade “equals the devil.”\n\n(RR 22: 81-82).\n\n      In October of 2012, Escalante encountered appellant having a secret talk\n\nwith another inmate, Troy Williams, who was housed across from appellant. (RR\n\n23: 36-37, 67). Appellant and Williams admitted to Escalante that they were\n\nplanning an escape when appellant was transported for his court hearing in January\n\nof 2013. (RR 23: 36-37, 67). Escalante actually overheard them discussing escape\n\nplans on two different occasions. (RR 23: 38). Williams explained to Escalante\n\nthat appellant planned for someone to come to the jail with a gun and start shooting\n\ncorrections officers. (RR 23: 37, 38). The day before Escalante testified in this\n\ntrial, he overheard appellant telling another inmate that Escalante was not\n\ntrustworthy and was a “snitch.” (RR 23: 39).\n\n      On August 6, 2013, Travis County Sheriff’s Deputy Donald MacIntyre\n\nheard a commotion and applause coming from the dayroom. (RR 23: 196). He\n\nlooked into the dayroom and saw appellant taking a bow among the inmates. (RR\n\n23: 196). The inmates had just watched a news story on the television regarding\n\nappellant and a court hearing in this capital murder. (RR 23: 196-197). After\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\fappellant took his bow, an inmate yelled “fuck the police,” and appellant\n\nacknowledged that inmate by raising his fist in the air. (RR 23: 202). A camera in\n\nthe jail captured this event, and the video of it (SX97) was played for the jury. (RR\n\n23: 204).\n\n\nAppellant’s\t\r  Mail\t\r  and\t\r  Recorded\t\r  Phone\t\r  Conversations\t\r  in\t\r  Jail\t\r  \n\n       Due to the report that appellant planned to overtake a corrections officer to\n\nescape, Austin Police Detective David Fugitt realized that he needed to check\n\nappellant’s phone calls daily for the officers’ safety. (RR 23: 83-84). Detective\n\nFugitt listened to approximately 16 hours of appellant’s recorded phone\n\nconversations. (RR 23: 84). Fugitt also read appellant’s mail and emails and\n\nwatched video of his visitations. (RR 23: 84). Appellant never expressed remorse\n\nfor killing Officer Padron in any of those communications. (RR 23: 84). His only\n\nexpression of remorse came during his interrogation, and it was initially in regard\n\nto himself. (RR 23: 84).\n\n       The State played SX85, a phone conversation between appellant and his\n\nmother recorded on April 25, 2012, while appellant was in jail. (RR 23: 76-77).\n\nAppellant told his mother that he had been sent to the health services building in\n\nthe jail for being depressed. (RR 23: 77). But, he disagreed with the depression\n\ndiagnosis because he was joking about being depressed or committing suicide.\n\n(RR 23: 77). Appellant also wrote his sister after a hospital visit. (RR 23: 114;\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fSX91). Appellant wrote that he was put in the hospital after he joked about no\n\nsharp objects and called jail officials “stupid.” (RR 23: 114).\n\n      On March 10, 2013, appellant had another recorded phone conversation with\n\nhis mother. (RR 23: 79; SX86). In that conversation, appellant gave his mother a\n\ncode for a secret alphabet so they could bypass security at the jail in regard to their\n\nmail. (RR 23: 79). Appellant had drawn an image of an alien utilizing a shading\n\ntechnique where the letters of the alphabet were written inside the image. (RR 23:\n\n79-80). Appellant called his mother again on March 31, 2013, and discussed\n\nmurderabilia. (RR 23: 81). In another phone conversation with his mother,\n\nappellant said an inmate offered him $30 for his artwork, the most money he knew\n\nof being offered for artwork. (RR 23: 101). So, appellant made a copy of the\n\nartwork to sell “just for the bragging rights.” (RR 23: 101-102).\n\n      Anthony Angel, with the Travis County Sheriff’s Office security threat unit,\n\ncopied appellant’s mail at the request of Detective Fugitt. (RR 23: 106).\n\nAppellant primarily wrote letters to his mother, sister, and Feland. (RR 23: 110).\n\nHis mother set up a pen pal account for him on meet-an-inmate.com, and he asked\n\nher to make his profile sound “more bad” because people might be looking for\n\nsomeone “more criminal-ish.” (RR 23: 112). Appellant wrote his mother that he\n\nwas at the top of the prison pecking order in relation to crimes committed. (RR 23:\n\n113; SX90). In letters to Feland, appellant said he did not like being in the general\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fprison population because he didn’t particularly get along with inmates or cops\n\nbecause they were “not [his] type of people.” (RR 23: 115). Appellant reminded\n\nFeland to allow him to run the defense and to not talk to anyone on his legal team\n\nbecause “they [were] only out for themselves.” (RR 23: 116; SX93). In another\n\nletter, appellant told Feland “not much else going on. Just living the dream. I’m\n\nretired at 25.” (RR 23: 118; SX95). He added a smiley face. (RR 23: 118).\n\n          According to Deputy Angel, coded mail presented security concerns\n\nregarding escape plans or attacks on officers or other inmates. (RR 23: 107).\n\nInmates who kept notes on the movements of guards in the jail also presented\n\nsecurity concerns regarding escape attempts or assaults on staff. (RR 23: 107).\n\n\nInmate\t\r  Classification\t\r  System\t\r  and\t\r  Prison\t\r  “Society”\t\r  \n\n          Stephen Rogers, a retired warden and corrections officer, testified regarding\n\nthe prison classification system for inmates. A person sentenced to life without\n\nparole was classified as a G3 and was in the general population. (RR 23: 134). A\n\nG3 classified inmate had all the privileges15 of a minimum security G2 inmate\n\nexcept that he could not be housed in a dormitory outside the prison but within the\n\nouter fence. (RR 23: 135). The G3 inmate had the same contact with prison staff\n\nand volunteers as a G2 and went to chow and walked the hallways without\n\nhandcuffs. (RR 23: 136). The prison provided food, beds, and television to the\n15\n     These privileges included contact visits and commissary eligibility. (RR 23: 135).\n\n\n                                                 28\n\fprisoner; radios were available for purchase in the commissary. (RR 23: 190).\n\nPrisoners in the general population were allowed to make phone calls, receive\n\nemails, and have contact with family members. (RR 23: 160, 191). Yet, prisoners\n\nin the general population sometimes attacked, caused serious bodily injury, and/or\n\nkilled prison guards. (RR 23: 191). On the other hand, a prisoner under a death\n\nsentence was classified like an administrative segregation prisoner, i.e., he was\n\nconfined to his cell 23 hours a day and allowed one hour for recreation. (RR 23:\n\n138).\n\n        Rogers discussed the problem with inmates making weapons in prison with\n\nsome prisoners smart enough to make weapons out of “just about anything[.]” (RR\n\n23: 148-154). And, if a prisoner couldn’t make a weapon, he had the opportunity\n\nto obtain one from another inmate. (RR 23: 154). And, prisoners had access to\n\ndangerous items through prison industry. (RR 23: 155).\n\n        Prisoners also found ways to access contraband, with cell phones being the\n\nforemost problem.16 (RR 23: 157). Prisoners often used cell phones to contact\n\ntheir victims or persons who testified against them. (RR 23: 157). Drugs were\n\nlikewise a problem in the prison system and easier to smuggle than cell phones.\n\n\n\n\n16\n  One prisoner even managed to access Rogers’ Facebook account even though he was in\npermanent lockup. (RR 23: 157).\n\n\n                                            29\n\f(RR 23: 158). Many prisoners were adept at making alcoholic beverages, called\n\nhooch or chalk. (RR 23: 158-159).\n\n       As a warden, Rogers would have concerns with an inmate who attempted to\n\ncommunicate with people outside of prison through coded mail. (RR 23: 159).\n\nSuch a prisoner presented a threat to correctional officers, other inmates, and even\n\nthe public. (RR 23: 160-161). Rogers would also have security concerns about a\n\nprisoner who tracked the activities of correctional officers. (RR 23: 161).\n\nPrisoners inclined to commit acts of violence would have opportunities to commit\n\nacts of violence or kill while in prison. (RR 23: 164). And, prisoners who had\n\nanimus toward police officers would have opportunities in prison to hurt them.\n\n(RR 23: 164).\n\n\nOfficer\t\r  Padron’s\t\r  Personal\t\r  and\t\r  Professional\t\r  History\t\r  \n\n       Officer Padron’s older sister, Linda Diaz, testified that Officer Padron\n\nenlisted in the Marine Corps when he was just 17 years old and still in high school.\n\n(RR 23: 210). After service with the Marines, Officer Padron worked as a\n\ncorrections officer, first for the Eden Detention Center and then the San Angelo\n\nPolice Department. (RR 23: 210). Officer Padron moved to Austin and became\n\nemployed with the airport police and then transferred to the Austin Police\n\nDepartment. (RR 23: 210-211). Killed at age 40, Officer Padron had given more\n\n\n\n\n                                               30\n\fthan half his life serving his country and his community and protecting the public.\n\n(RR 23: 211).\n\n        Diaz described her brother as a very honorable man of integrity and\n\ncommitment. (RR 23: 211). She described Officer Padron’s first act of bravery as\n\na rookie police officer when he twice ran into a burning building to save victims.\n\nFirst, he attempted to save two children, and then he ran back into the house to\n\nsave a fellow officer who had not emerged from the burning home. (RR 23: 212).\n\nAlthough divorced, Officer Padron was a dedicated father to his two young\n\ndaughters, aged 6 and 10 at the time of his death. (RR 23: 212). He was even\n\ninvolved in their school because he loved being around children. (RR 23: 213).\n\n        While working full-time for the San Angelo Police Department, Officer\n\nPadron continued his education, earning degrees in psychology and criminal\n\njustice. (RR 23: 213). He graduated with honors. (RR 23: 213). And, Officer\n\nPadron had a positive impact on his nieces and nephews. (RR 23: 213). One\n\nnephew was following in his footsteps and had enlisted in the Marines. (RR 23:\n\n213).\n\n        Officer Padron was “very caring” and “very loving.” (RR 23: 214). His\n\ndaughters missed their “tremendous daddy” time. (RR 23: 214). Officer Padron\n\nwas also very close to his parents, especially his father who was not in very good\n\nhealth. (RR 23: 214). Officer Padron’s parents and siblings attended the trial, and\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\fhaving to hear the testimony was “horrifying” and “almost unbearable.” (RR 23:\n\n214). Diaz could see her parents’ pain every day and testified that “no parent\n\nshould have to go through this” and “[h]is little girls shouldn’t have to go through\n\ntheir life without their father.” (RR 23: 214).\n\n\nDefense\t\r  Evidence\t\r  at\t\r  the\t\r  Punishment\t\r  Phase\t\r  \n\n       Travis County corrections officer Richard Low had contact with appellant\n\nduring his two-year time in the health services building. (RR 24: 10). Deputy Low\n\ndescribed appellant as compliant and respectful to him. (RR 24: 11). But, on\n\ncross-examination, Deputy Low testified that an inmate was not compliant if he\n\nmade hooch, hoarded prescription pills, or tracked the movements and activities of\n\ncorrections officers. (RR 24: 14-15). All those activities were violations of jail\n\nregulations, as was sending coded messages to civilian persons through legal mail\n\nin the jail. (RR 24: 15). Appellant further violated jail regulations by giving\n\nhimself a homemade tattoo. (RR 24: 39). Psychological evidence showed\n\nappellant was capable of following rules if he so chose, but he did not like to be\n\ncontrolled by other people. (RR 24: 127, 151).\n\n       Dr. James Ascough, employed with the USDA, testified via Skype for the\n\ndefense. (RR 24: 43). He met the appellant through a work-study program when\n\nappellant was a student at Colorado State University. (RR 24: 45). Dr. Ascough\n\ndescribed appellant as a very good programmer. (RR 24:49). Appellant had Dr.\n\n\n                                                32\n\fAscough had co-authored a chapter in a book entitled Advances in Nitrogen\n\nManagement for Water Quality. (RR 24: 53-54). Appellant worked with Dr.\n\nAscough at the USDA for approximately 18 months, from 2009 to Christmas 2010.\n\n(RR 24: 56). Dr. Ascough encouraged appellant to continue working with him and\n\nto attend graduate school, but appellant wanted to begin working and earn money.\n\n(RR 24: 57-58). Appellant took the job with Hewlett-Packard in Austin, and the\n\ntwo ceased contact in early to mid 2011. (RR 24: 57-58). Dr. Ascough thought\n\nappellant was a quiet, hardworking, and respectful “kid,” and he was “stunned”\n\nwhen he heard about appellant killing Officer Padron. (RR 24: 59).\n\n      Cross-examination revealed that Dr. Ascough actually knew very little about\n\nappellant. (RR 24: 66). He did not know that appellant used marijuana and\n\nalcohol daily and that he regularly used cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, and acid\n\nduring his college career. (RR 24: 65-66). Dr. Ascough was aware that appellant\n\nhad a girlfriend, but he didn’t know her name. (RR 24: 65). Appellant told Dr.\n\nAscough about his motorcycle, that he liked to go fast, and that he eluded police on\n\nit. (RR 24: 67). Appellant was not embarrassed about that. (RR 24: 67).\n\n      Dr. William Carter prepared a psychological study on appellant for the\n\ndefense. (RR 24: 78). Dr. Carter twice interviewed appellant in 2014. (RR 24:\n\n83). In early adolescence, appellant began to emotionally withdraw and about age\n\n\n\n\n                                        33\n\f12 he fell into depression. (RR 24: 88, 91-92). Appellant began to experiment\n\nwith drugs in middle school to escape his depression. (RR 24: 95-96).\n\n       Appellant avoided social contact, and Dr. Carter described him as\n\nhumorless. (RR 24: 96). As a teenager, appellant felt lonely and isolated.17 (RR\n\n24: 101). Dr. Carter thought appellant’s depression probably worsened into his\n\nteenage years, and he felt helpless and suicidal and hated his life. (RR 24: 106).\n\nYet, appellant was not depressed to the point of psychosis. (RR 24: 118). A\n\ncommon theme in appellant’s life was his overstatement of his importance by\n\nbragging, pushing limits, or letting others know how smart he was. (RR 24: 102).\n\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Carter confirmed that the people he interviews\n\nhave a personal bias to present themselves in a manner in accord with their\n\nperceived best interest. (RR 24: 154). Dr. Carter conceded that it was possible\n\nappellant claimed he was depressed only after meeting with Dr. Carter and\n\ndeciding it was to his benefit to be depressed. (RR 24: 162). But, regardless of\n\none’s depression level, Dr. Carter confirmed that a person would know not to kill a\n\npolice officer. (RR 24: 167).\n\n       Appellant’s report to Dr. Carter of his lack of friends was disputed by his\n\ndisciplinary records from high school and college. (RR 24: 157-158). The\n17\n  Cross-examination revealed that appellant had had friends with whom he played guitar and\nrode motorcycles. (RR 24: 157). These friends were apparently so well known that appellant\ntold his mother in letters to use the names of these friends as clues she could insert into his codes.\n(RR 24: 157).\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fdisciplinary records indicated appellant acted in concert with others in sneaking\n\naround the halls or out of classes, of using drugs behind Hobby Lobby with his\n\nmotorcycle-riding friends, and for showing affection on campus to a girl. (RR 24:\n\n157-158). Appellant’s disciplinary records also reflected assaultive conduct by\n\nhim. (RR 24: 159). In one incident, appellant “sucker punched” another boy in the\n\nlocker room. (RR 24: 159). The person writing the report was concerned because\n\nappellant showed no remorse for the assault. (RR 24: 159).\n\n       Dr. Carter admitted in cross-examination that appellant displayed\n\nmanipulative and controlling behaviors before and after this capital offense. (RR\n\n24: 162-163). Appellant used Nikki Nance to get drugs, and he told Jenna Feland\n\nto not talk to anyone about him, including his lawyers, mitigator, private eye, etc.\n\nuntil he told her to. (RR 24: 162-164; SX93).\n\n       Appellant told Dr. Carter that he went to the Walmart to steal18 and he took\n\nhis gun with him “just in case.” (RR 24: 167). Appellant knew he shot a police\n\nofficer, and, by the extent of the injury, he knew the officer was dead. (RR 24:\n\n169). Dr. Carter admitted that appellant lacked empathy. (RR 24: 164). The fact\n\nthat appellant planned to profit from this capital murder was disturbing to one of\n\nhis psychologists. (RR 25: 132).\n\n\n18\n  Evidence showed appellant had recently received a promotion at work and earned\napproximately $65,000 to $70,000 at his job. (RR 24: 180).\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\f       The defense also presented Dr. Walter Harrell, a psychologist specializing in\n\nneuropsychology and rehabilitation psychology. (RR 24: 222). Based on\n\nappellant’s self-reported frontal lobe injuries,19 Dr. Harrell thought appellant had\n\nbeen struggling with depression and sadness his whole life. (RR 24: 249, 254).\n\nDr. Harrell opined that appellant’s multiple concussive events20 predisposed him to\n\nhave struggles with depression, suicidal idealization, and substance abuse. (RR\n\n25:98). Dr. Harrell claimed appellant had a substance abuse disorder that had\n\nbeen evident since third grade. (RR 24: 255). This testimony, however, was also\n\nbased on appellant’s self-report that he began drinking alcohol and smoking\n\nmarijuana in third grade; appellant also claimed he did cocaine with his father.\n\n(RR 24: 256).\n\n       Even Dr. Harrell reported that appellant showed a complete lack of remorse\n\nfor killing Officer Padron.21 (RR 25: 131-132). Appellant told Dr. Harrell that he\n\nwent to Walmart to steal groceries, that he carried a gun, was pursued by an\n\n19\n  One such injury resulted from a skateboarding accident when appellant was 14 years old, but\nappellant’s brain scan following this accident was normal. (RR 25: 79).\n20\n  On cross-examination, Dr. Harrell acknowledged that appellant was very intelligent, and he\nhad no difficutly communicating with him. (RR 25:82-83). He also had to acknowledge that his\nassessment of appellant’s frontal lobe injuries was merely an inference based on unsubstantiated\nreports of head injuries from appellant. (RR 25: 85-87). In one such report, appellant told Dr.\nHarrell of a head injury he sustained when he was 18 months old. Dr. Harrell admitted that at\nsuch a young age, appellant would not have an independent recollection of that event. (RR 25:\n85-87).\n21\n  Appellant’s aunt, who was the County Attorney for Pottawatomie County, Kansas, testified\nthat appellant had never expressed remorse for killing Officer Padron. (RR 25: 22, 60).\n\n\n\n                                              36\n\fofficer, and shot him. (RR 25: 102). Dr. Harrell testified that appellant struggled\n\nwith impulse control all of his life. (RR 25: 104). But, he thought appellant’s\n\nkilling of Officer Padron was a drug-related problem. (RR 25: 105). Appellant\n\ncould become dangerous and commit acts of violence in prison if he was under the\n\ninfluence of alcohol or drugs. (RR 25: 111).\n\n        Dr. Harrell further confirmed on cross-examination that no mitigating\n\nfactors of sexual abuse, physical abuse, mental retardation, homelessness, or lack\n\nof food were present in this case. (RR 25: 128-129). Even though appellant\n\ncommitted various offenses as a juvenile, he never did time in the juvenile system.\n\n(RR 25: 130). Appellant was highly intelligent, had excelled in school, and had\n\neven graduated Colorado State University with honors in a highly technical field.\n\n(RR 25: 129). At the time of this offense, appellant had a good job with a national\n\ncompany and had no work-related issues. (RR 25: 129-130).\n\n        Psychiatrist Dr. Harold Scott diagnosed appellant with depressive and\n\naddictive problems. (RR 25: 180). Dr. Scott testified appellant was highly\n\naddictive, having used substances since age nine to “obliterate reality” and self-\n\nmedicate for his depression. (RR 25: 208-209). Appellant used alcohol, cough\n\nsyrup, marijuana, and computer duster (an inhalant) by age thirteen. (RR 25: 208-\n\n209).\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f        On August 26, 2012, corrections officer Stephen Crim found appellant on\n\ntop of his bunk with his hands in the air vent. (RR 24: 199-200). Crim searched\n\nappellant’s cell and found torn bedsheets fastened into a noose and a three-foot\n\nlong rope. (RR 24: 201). The noose was in the air vent. (RR 24: 201). Just\n\nexpressing suicidal feelings would get an inmate transferred to the health services\n\nbuilding in jail. (RR 24: 40). On another occasion, an inmate reported to Crim\n\nthat he overheard appellant and another inmate discussing escape plans because\n\nthey were tired of being in jail and wanted out. (RR 24: 203). The fellow inmate\n\nplanned to overtake a guard, get his keys, and let appellant out of his cell. (RR 24:\n\n203).\n\n\nState’s\t\r  Rebuttal\t\r  Evidence\t\r  at\t\r  Punishment\t\r  \n\n        In appellant’s phone calls, letters, and visitation, he showed a fascination\n\nwith major criminal events that had occurred since this capital murder. (RR 25:\n\n248). He often spoke of the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting, the Sandy\n\nHook Elementary School shooting, the Boston Marathon bombing, and the DC\n\ncapital police shooting. (RR 25: 248-249). Appellant was intrigued with the\n\nnumber of casualties and the type of weapons used. (RR 25: 249). His mother\n\nonce commented that she felt sorry for the shooter in the movie theater massacre in\n\nColorado. (RR 25: 249).\n\n\n\n\n                                               38\n\f      Dr. Marisa Mauro, a licensed psychologist, interviewed appellant on\n\nFebruary 17, 2014, regarding his depression, family, substance abuse before,\n\nduring, and after this offense, prognosis for recovery from depression and\n\nsubstance abuse, and his adjustment to incarceration. (RR 26: 13-15). Appellant\n\nprovided Dr. Mauro with little information and was very emotionless. (RR 26:\n\n16). Dr. Mauro found no evidence of psychoses, and she disagreed with the\n\ndiagnosis of major depression, severe and recurrent. (RR 26: 17). Dr. Mauro\n\nopined that appellant’s alleged suicide attempt (the taking of the pills while in jail)\n\nwas more of a gesture, and the circumstances of that event raised questions for her\n\nregarding appellant’s intent of taking the pills. (RR 26: 20). After his break up\n\nwith Feland, appellant threatened to kill himself with his gun but that was only a\n\nruse to get her back. (RR 26: 24-25).\n\n      Dr. Mauro did not believe that depression impacted appellant before, during\n\nor after this capital offense. (RR 26: 31). Records also indicated that appellant\n\nsaid he made the nooses to “mess with” the jail psychiatrist and to get a cell change\n\nto a cell with a window where he could get radio reception. (RR 26: 69).\n\nAppellant displayed shockingly little difficulty adjusting to jail. (RR 26: 19). He\n\nsocialized with other inmates, engaged in daily activities with them, and even\n\ncalled them “friends.” (RR 26: 25-26, 36).\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\f        Appellant told Dr. Mauro that he had a “pretty normal” childhood with\n\ndifficult issues being his parents’ divorce, few friends, and a sometimes\n\nemotionally abusive mother. (RR 26:22-23). He reported to Dr. Mauro substantial\n\nmore drug use than documented in his records. (RR 26: 28). Appellant reported\n\nabusing substances daily and using every classification of drug, from prescription\n\npills to opium, methadone, street drugs, Ecstasy, Xanax and alcohol. (RR 26: 28).\n\nDespite appellant’s dependency on drugs and alcohol, he did not experience\n\nwithdrawal symptoms while in jail. (RR 26: 29). Dr. Mauro knew from her work\n\nin prison systems that inmates had access to narcotics “pretty much all the time”\n\nand alcohol. (RR 26: 70). Dr. Mauro testified that psychiatric medications were\n\nvaluable in prison and used for favors. (RR 26: 70).\n\n        Dr. Mauro used a psychopathy checklist to measure future dangerousness,\n\nbut she did not use that tool in this case. (RR 26: 37). The psychopathy checklist\n\ndefined asocial behaviors or not conforming to laws, violating the rights of others,\n\nhaving restricted or shallow ranged of affect and a lack of empathy, and being\n\nconning and manipulative. (RR 26: 37).\n\n\nThe\t\r  Verdict\t\r  at\t\r  the\t\r  Punishment\t\r  Phase\t\r  \n\n        The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a probability that\n\nappellant would commit criminal acts of violence and constitute a continuing threat\n\nto society. (RR 26: 216). The jury also found that there were not sufficient\n\n\n                                                   40\n\fmitigating circumstances to warrant a sentence of life imprisonment rather than a\n\ndeath sentence. (RR 26: 216). Appellant requested a jury poll, which revealed the\n\njury’s answers to the punishment verdict were unanimous. (RR 26: 217-218). In\n\naccordance with the jury’s verdict, the trial judge sentenced appellant to death by\n\nlethal injection. (RR 26: 221).\n\n\n                          SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENTS\n\nState’s\t\r  Reply\t\r  to\t\r  Appellant’s\t\r  First\t\r  Point\t\r  of\t\r  Error: Any rational jury could\n\nhave found beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a probability that the\n\nappellant would commit criminal acts of violence constituting a continuing threat\n\nto society. The direct evidence of this capital murder and the circumstances\n\nsurrounding it were highly probative of appellant’s propensity for future\n\ndangerousness. He entered the Walmart armed with a loaded firearm and\n\nmagazine, clearly intending violence. When appellant’s first shot at Officer\n\nPadron did not injure him, appellant placed the muzzle of the gun against Officer\n\nPadron’s neck, fired, and killed him. Appellant also fired at the heads of Walmart\n\nemployees who detained him.\n\n       Furthermore, appellant never showed remorse for committing this capital\n\nmurder. Instead, he was boastful and cavalier. Appellant gained self-worth from\n\ncommitting this offense and other criminal acts. He showed a life-long disrespect\n\nfor law enforcement and others. He continually committed violations while in jail\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fand planned a violent escape. Appellant’s escalating drug use and abuse was\n\nconsidered a factor in his commission of this capital murder, and appellant’s drug\n\nuse, which made him dangerous, continued while he was incarcerated.\n\n       The evidence in this case showed that prior to and after committing the\n\ncapital murder of Officer Padron appellant engaged in conduct that constituted a\n\nthreat to society. The evidence was therefore legally sufficient to sustain the jury’s\n\nverdict at punishment.\n\nState’s\t\r  Reply\t\r  to\t\r  Appellant’s\t\r  Second\t\r  Point\t\r  of\t\r  Error: Appellant’s second point\n\nof error should be overruled because appellant did not suffer any harm from the\n\ntrial court’s denial of his challenge for cause to venireperson Reading. The record\n\nreflects that appellant utilized only 14 peremptory challenges in selecting the 12\n\nmembers of the jury. Appellant utilized his fifteenth peremptory challenge to\n\nstrike a venireperson in the pool of alternates. Appellant did not request an\n\nadditional peremptory strike because he did not need one. He also did not identify\n\nan objectionable juror who sat on his jury. Under these circumstances, appellant\n\nfailed to show he suffered any harm.\n\n       Alternatively, the trial judge did not err in denying appellant’s challenge for\n\ncause to venireperson Reading. The entirety of Reading’s voir dire revealed that\n\nhe could follow the law, hold the State to its burden of proof at both phases of trial,\n\nand consider mitigating evidence. Although Reading viewed the death penalty as\n\n\n                                               42\n\fan appropriate punishment for certain murders, his voir dire reflects that he would\n\nnot automatically assess it. The record is sufficient to sustain the trial judge’s\n\nruling on appellant’s challenge for cause to Reading. Appellant’s second point of\n\nerror should be overruled on the merits as well.\n\nState’s\t\r  Reply\t\r  to\t\r  Appellant’s\t\r  Third\t\r  Point\t\r  of\t\r  Error: Appellant failed to\n\npreserve any alleged error for review. Appellant requested a hearing on Dr.\n\nMauro’s qualifications, and the trial judge granted that request. Appellant\n\nrequested to explore the basis of Dr. Mauro’s findings, and the trial judge allowed\n\nthat inquiry. There being no adverse rulings, appellant failed to preserve any\n\nalleged error for review. Moreover, appellant had no objection to Dr. Mauro’s\n\ntestimony at trial.\n\n       Additionally, the trial judge afforded appellant a proper hearing under Rule\n\n705(b). By its express terms, Rule 705(b) does not authorize inquiry into the\n\nexpert’s specific findings. It allows inquiry into the underlying basis of the\n\nexpert’s opinion, which the trial judge allowed in this case. The record reflects\n\nthat the trial judge complied with the requisites of Rule 705(b), and appellant fails\n\nto show any alleged error.\n\n       Appellant’s third point of error is wholly without merit and should be\n\noverruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 43\n\f         STATE’S REPLY TO APPELLANT’S FIRST POINT OF ERROR\n\n         The\t\r  evidence\t\r  was\t\r  legally\t\r  sufficient\t\r  to\t\r  establish\t\r  that\t\r  there\t\r  is\t\r  a\t\r  \n         probability\t\r  that\t\r  appellant\t\r  would\t\r  commit\t\r  criminal\t\r  acts\t\r  of\t\r  violence\t\r  \n         and\t\r  constitute\t\r  a\t\r  continuing\t\r  threat\t\r  to\t\r  society.\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \nStandard and Scope of Review\n\n         When reviewing the future-dangerousness special issue, the appellate court\n\nviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s finding and determines\n\nwhether a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a\n\nprobability that the appellant would commit criminal acts of violence constituting a\n\ncontinuing threat to society.

Appellant entered the\n\nWalmart armed with a loaded weapon and with the intent to shoplift. He took the\n\nloaded weapon “just in case,” clearly anticipating using violence against anyone\n\nwho interfered with his criminal endeavor. Appellant loaded the firearm with\n\nhollow point bullets to cause maximum damage to his victim(s). Along with the\n\nloaded firearm, appellant carried a magazine loaded with additional hollow point\n\nbullets, indicating his willingness to shoot and possibly kill multiple victims.\n\n      Appellant, in fact, fired his weapon multiple times. His first shot hit Officer\n\nPadron in his uniform pocket but did not injure Officer Padron because of his\n\nprotective vest. Appellant then knowingly placed the gun against Officer Padron’s\n\nneck and fired again, killing him. As Walmart employees tried to subdue\n\nappellant, he fired again, almost shooting both LeMere and Jordy in their heads.\n\nAppellant killed Officer Padron and attempted to kill Walmart employees over a\n\nmere $56.90 of shoplifted groceries.

Appellant never expressed or showed remorse for\n\ncommitting this capital murder, and he had no sympathy for his victim. Rather, he\n\nwas repeatedly cavalier and boastful. Appellant laughed after killing Officer\n\nPadron and smiled and winked at arresting officers. In jail, appellant enjoyed\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fsharing news stories about his capital murder with fellow inmates, took a bow in\n\nresponse to their applause, and pumped his fist in response to a disparaging remark\n\nregarding the police. Even appellant’s own witnesses22 testified he never\n\nexpressed remorse for this capital murder.\n\n          Appellant’s propensity for future dangerousness was supported by evidence\n\nof his long-term disrespect for law enforcement. While in jail, appellant tracked\n\nthe activities and movements of corrections officers in preparation for a violent\n\nescape from jail, which involved shooting law enforcement officers. He\n\ncommitted repeated violations of jail regulations and created a code to bypass jail\n\nsecurity with his mail. Evidence established that inmates who communicated via\n\ncoded mail presented a security threat to corrections officers, other inmates, and\n\neven the public. In just the four months preceding this capital murder, appellant\n\ncontinually committed criminal offenses, including traffic violations, possession of\n\nmarijuana and other controlled substances, possession of drug paraphernalia, DWI,\n\nand excessive drug usage.

Appellant told his mother that he was\n\nat the top of the prison pecking order. The night of this capital murder, appellant\n\nwanted to commit a robbery, telling his roommate that he had gotten away with\n\n“worse shit.” Appellant saw this capital murder as an opportunity for financial\n\ngain by selling his story, which even his defense expert found disturbing.

He was obsessed with mass murder and other\n\nviolent tragedies such as the movie theater massacre in Colorado, the Sandy Hook\n\nElementary murders, and the Boston Marathon bombing.\n\n      Appellant further displayed a lack of respect for others, even his friends. He\n\nwas manipulative, using Nikki Nance for drugs and money, despite his high-paying\n\njob. Appellant threatened to commit suicide with his firearm as a ruse to get\n\nFeland back as his girlfriend. He was polite with police officers and pleaded that\n\nhe wanted to be a “productive member of society” to get out of tickets or arrests.\n\nHe feigned suicide attempts while incarcerated to get better housing.\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\f      The substantial psychiatric evidence in this case supported the jury’s\n\ndetermination that appellant constituted a continuing threat to society. Appellant\n\ndid not like to be controlled by others and lacked empathy. He had the capacity to\n\nchange, but chose not to. Appellant’s mental health experts diagnosed appellant\n\nwith major depression, but also considered his depression a factor in his\n\ncommission of crime. The jury could infer from the evidence regarding his\n\npersonality that his character traits were consistent with the factors on the\n\npsychopathy checklist for future dangerousness.\n\n      The jury could reasonably believe that appellant’s drug use made him\n\ndangerous.

Although intoxicated on Xanax the night he committed capital\n\nmurder, appellant planned his criminal activities at Walmart, went to the store\n\nintending to steal from the pharmacy, armed himself with a loaded firearm and\n\nmagazine, and was fully aware that he had murdered a police officer. Defense\n\nwitness Dr. Harrell thought appellant’s killing of Officer Padron was a drug-related\n\nproblem, and he testified that appellant could become dangerous and commit acts\n\nof violence in prison if he were under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The State\n\npresented evidence that prison inmates had regular access to drugs and alcohol.\n\nAnd, there was evidence that psychiatric medications were valuable in prison and\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\fcould be used for favors. Despite appellant’s escalating drug use prior to this\n\ncapital murder, he did not experience withdrawal symptoms in jail, suggesting he\n\ncontinued to abuse substances. Indeed, appellant made “hooch” while incarcerated\n\nand hoarded pills in his cell.\n\n       Appellant contends the evidence in this case is insufficient like the evidence\n\nin Berry, Beltran, and Huffman.23 Appellant’s brief at p. 17. But, these cases are\n\neasily distinguishable on their facts. In Berry, the evidence showed the defendant\n\nwas dangerous “only to those of her own children” and there was a very low\n\nprobability that she would have any more children if sentenced to life in prison.\n\n233 S.W.3d at 864. Additionally, the State in that case invited the jury to utilize an\n\nimproper standard in its consideration of future dangerousness by asking the jury\n\nto assume that the defendant would be living in the free world. Id. at 863.24 In\n\nBeltran, the Court determined the facts of that robbery-murder alone were\n\ninsufficient to sustain the future dangerousness issue, and Beltran’s prior criminal\n\nhistory reflected mostly alcohol-related offenses. 728 S.W.2d 389-90.

Id. at 225.\n\n      The evidence in this case showed that prior to committing this capital\n\nmurder appellant continually engaged in conduct that constituted a threat to\n\nsociety. The killing of Officer Padron was the culmination of a life-long escalating\n\npattern of violations of the law, disrespect for law enforcement officers and other\n\ncitizens, including friends, escalating drug use and abuse, threatened violence, and\n\ndepression. The evidence at trial showed appellant continued to engage in such\n\nbehaviors even after being incarcerated for this capital murder. Based on all the\n\nevidence, the jury’s finding that there was a probability that appellant would\n\ncommit criminal acts of violence and constitute a continuing threat to society was\n\nrational. The evidence was therefore legally sufficient to sustain the jury’s answer\n\non the punishment issue.

In a\n\ndeath penalty case with only one defendant, that defendant is entitled to fifteen\n\nperemptory challenges. Art. 35.15(a), V.A.C.C.P.\n\n\nAppellant Cannot Show Harm\n\n      The State had no objections to Reading as a juror. (RR 11: 205). Appellant\n\nobjected to Reading on the basis that he had a bias toward the death penalty and\n\nthat he would require the defense to present mitigating evidence. (RR 11: 205).\n\nThe trial judge denied appellant’s challenge to Reading, and appellant exercised a\n\nperemptory challenge against Reading. (RR 11: 205; RR 16: 123-124).

(RR 11: 133-134). Consequently, appellant did not identify an\n\nobjectionable juror on his jury because none sat on his jury. And, appellant did not\n\nclaim that he would have struck an alleged objectionable juror if he had had an\n\nadditional peremptory strike to use. Under these circumstances, appellant fails to\n\nshow he suffered any harm from the trial court’s denial of his challenge for cause.\n\nComeaux, 445 S.W.3d at 750. Appellant’s second point of error should be\n\noverruled on this basis.\n\n\nAlternatively, the Trial Judge Did Not Err in Denying the Challenge for\nCause\n\n      Although recognizing that he cannot show harm because he did not use all of\n\nhis peremptory challenges, appellant’s brief at pp. 18-19, appellant nevertheless\n\ncontends that the trial judge erred in denying his challenge for cause to\n\nvenireperson Reading. Appellant contends Reading was challengeable for cause\n\n\n\n                                         53\n\ffor his bias in favor of the death penalty and for his need for the defense to present\n\nmitigating evidence.\n\nFacts Relevant to the Challenge for Cause\n\n      During the State’s voir dire examination, Reading indicated that his views\n\nregarding the death penalty would not affect his ability to listen to the evidence and\n\nthe law in this case as given by the trial judge and to decide the punishment issues.\n\n(RR 11: 166). As for murder, Reading affirmatively noted that he could consider\n\nthe entire range of punishment, and he, in fact, could envision situations where the\n\nminimum and maximum punishments would be appropriate. (RR 11: 168).\n\nReading agreed with the prosecution that murder by itself was never sufficient for\n\nthe death penalty. (RR 11: 170). Reading believed capital punishment was\n\nappropriate for the capital murder of a police officer. (RR 11: 171).\n\n      Reading further understood that there were only two punishment options in a\n\ncapital murder case, and he was okay with that. (RR 11: 171-172). Reading could\n\n“absolutely” hold the State to its burden of proof of beyond a reasonable doubt and\n\nnot put any burden on the defense. (RR 11: 172). Reading understood, and\n\nagreed, that he should find the defendant “not guilty” if the State failed in its\n\nburden of proof and even if the defendant presented no evidence. (RR 11: 173).\n\n      Reading had a basic understanding of the punishment phase process in a\n\ncapital murder case regarding the special issues. (RR 11: 173-174). The\n\n\n\n                                          54\n\fprosecutor discussed the factors in the first punishment issue, viz: probability,\n\ncriminal acts of violence, and society. (RR 11: 175-179). The record reflects\n\nReading understood the issues related to those factors, the State’s continued burden\n\nof proof on those issues, and that the defendant did not have to do anything. (RR\n\n11: 175-176).\n\n      As for the mitigation issue, Reading indicated he was open to considering\n\nthat there could be mitigating evidence sufficient to choose life without parole as\n\nan appropriate punishment. (RR 11: 181). On the second punishment issue,\n\nReading could consider any mitigating evidence presented, the circumstances of\n\nthe offense, the defendant’s character and background, and the defendant’s moral\n\nculpability. (RR 11: 183-186). The prosecutor also discussed other potential\n\nmitigating factors with Reading. (RR 11: 186-188). Reading was willing to wait\n\nand hear all the evidence before making any decision about the punishment issues.\n\n(RR 11: 188).\n\n      The defense then questioned Reading. In response to a hypothetical\n\nregarding a capital murder of a police officer, Reading stated he would lean toward\n\nthe death penalty as an appropriate punishment where there were no defensive\n\nissues at guilt/innocence and where the jury has already determined the future\n\ndangerousness issue against the defendant. (RR 11: 190). Yet, Reading confirmed\n\nthat he could consider mitigating evidence. (RR 11: 191). When asked by defense\n\n\n\n                                          55\n\fcounsel if he would want the defense to bring evidence to convince him that death\n\nwas not the appropriate punishment, Reading answered affirmatively. (RR 11:\n\n191).\n\n        Further, regarding mental illness as mitigating evidence, Reading indicated\n\nthat killing a police officer was a serious offense and that it would be difficult to\n\nnot vote for the death penalty where such a murder was knowingly committed.\n\n(RR 11: 193). When asked by defense counsel to place himself on a spectrum of\n\nthe death penalty being reserved for the “worst of the worst” to being appropriate\n\nfor any murder, Reading tended to fall more toward believing the death penalty\n\nwas appropriate for any knowing and intentional murder. (RR 11: 196-197).\n\n        Reading confirmed that he could “absolutely” fairly and impartially consider\n\nall the evidence in this case, even in the punishment phase. (RR 11: 197). Reading\n\nclarified that he would not automatically lean toward the death penalty after\n\nfinding a person guilty of the capital murder of a police officer, as suggested by\n\ndefense counsel’s hypothetical, which had confused Reading. (RR 11: 197-198).\n\nAfter again discussing the defense hypothetical, Reading confirmed that he would\n\nlean toward the death penalty as the appropriate punishment where several factors\n\nwere present, to-wit: the defendant intentionally killed a police officer in the line\n\nof duty, there were no defensive issues and no mental illness issues, and the jury\n\n\n\n\n                                           56\n\fhad already found that the defendant would constitute a continuing threat to\n\nsociety. (RR 11: 199).\n\n       Finally, as to the Fifth Amendment right not to testify, Reading indicated\n\nthat he would not hold it against the defendant if he did not testify, but it would be\n\na question in his mind; i.e., why not testify and defend yourself if you are\n\ninnocent.25 (RR 11: 200). But, Reading indicated that he would do his best to put\n\nthat out of his mind if instructed by the trial judge to not consider it during\n\ndeliberations. (RR 11: 200-201). Reading confirmed for the trial judge, after\n\nhaving the instruction read to him, that he could follow the court’s instruction.\n\n(RR 11: 201-202).\n\n       The trial judge then questioned Reading. The judge determined that\n\nReading could “absolutely” consider the mitigation issue after finding that the\n\ndefendant would be a continuing threat to society. (RR 11: 202-203). The judge in\n\nfact noted that the jury only considered the second punishment issue if it had found\n\nthe first punishment in the affirmative, i.e. that the defendant would be a\n\ncontinuing threat to society. (RR 11: 202). Reading confirmed that he could\n\nconsider mitigating evidence and vote for a sentence less than death if warranted\n\nby the mitigating circumstances. (RR 11: 203).\n\n\n25\n Appellant does not contend on appeal that Reading was challengeable for cause on this basis.\nAnd, indeed he was not, given that he confirmed he could follow the law. (RR 11: 201-202).\n\n\n                                              57\n\f      The State had no objections to Reading as a juror. (RR 11: 205). Appellant\n\nobjected to Reading on the basis that he had a bias toward the death penalty and\n\nthat he would require the defense to present mitigating evidence. (RR 11: 205).\n\nThe trial judge denied appellant’s challenge to Reading, and appellant exercised a\n\nperemptory challenge against Reading. (RR 11: 205; RR 16: 123-124).\n\nStandard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n      The appellate court looks at the entire record of voir dire to determine if the\n\nevidence is sufficient to support the court’s ruling on a challenge for cause.\n\nGonzales, 353 S.W.3d at 831. The appellate court affords great deference to the\n\ntrial court’s ruling because the trial judge is present to observe the demeanor of the\n\nvenireperson and to listen to his tone of voice. Id., citing Feldman v.

Particular deference is afforded when the\n\nvenireperson’s answers are vacillating, unclear, or contradictory. Davis, 313\n\nS.W.3d at 344. The appellate court will reverse a trial court’s ruling on a challenge\n\nfor cause only if a clear abuse of discretion is evident. Gonzales, 353 S.W.3d at\n\n831, citing Davis, 313 S.W.3d at 344.\n\n      A venireperson is subject to a challenge for cause if he has a bias or\n\nprejudice against the defendant or against the law upon which either the State or\n\nthe defense is entitled to rely. Art. 35.16(b)(3), (c)(2), V.A.C.C.P.; Gardner v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1749178\"><a href=\"/opinion/1749178/gardner-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 295 (Tex.Crim.App. 2009). The test is whether a\n\n\n\n                                          58\n\fvenireperson’s bias or prejudice would substantially impair his “ability to carry out\n\nhis oath and instructions in accordance with the law.” Gonzales, 353 S.W.3d at\n\n831-32, quoting Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. The proponent of the challenge for\n\ncause must establish that the challenge was proper by showing that the\n\nvenireperson understood the requirements of the law and could not sufficiently\n\novercome his prejudice to follow the law. Gonzales, 353 S.W.3d at 832. Before a\n\nvenireperson may be excused for cause on that basis, the law must be explained to\n\nhim, and he must be asked whether he can follow that law, regardless of his\n\npersonal views. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744.\n\nApplication of Law to Facts\n\n       Viewing the entirety of Reading’s voir dire examination, it is clear that the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s challenge for cause to\n\nReading. Reading did not display a determination to automatically vote for the\n\ndeath penalty, as appellant contends.26 Appellant errs in relying on only a portion\n\nof Reading’s voir dire to support his argument.\n\n       Reading agreed that capital punishment was an appropriate punishment for\n\nthe intentional murder of a police officer, but he repeatedly confirmed that he\n\n\n26\n  Appellant also argues in his brief that because Reading had a bias toward the death penalty, he\nlowered the State’s burden of proof. Appellant’s brief at p. 21. Appellant did not make this\nargument regarding the burden of proof in the trial court, so that argument is not preserved for\nappellate review. Tex.R.App.Proc. 33.1. Moreover, Reading steadfastly maintained that he\nwould hold the State to its burden of proof. See (RR 11: 172-173, 175-176).\n\n\n                                               59\n\fcould hold the State to its burden of proof on the punishment issues, consider any\n\nmitigating evidence, and follow the court’s instructions. While, in one point of his\n\nvoir dire, Reading stated that he would vote for the death penalty for the knowing\n\nmurder of a police officer, that answer was in response to a hypothetical that\n\nconfused Reading. See (RR 11: 197-198). After again discussing the defense\n\nhypothetical, Reading confirmed that he would lean toward the death penalty as the\n\nappropriate punishment where several factors were present, viz: the defendant\n\nintentionally killed a police officer in the line of duty, there were no defensive\n\nissues and no mental illness issues, and the jury had already found that the\n\ndefendant would constitute a continuing threat to society. (RR 11: 199). But, as\n\nhis voir dire indicates, he would only “lean” toward the death penalty; it was not an\n\n“automatic” assessment of death. Reading’s voir dire reflected that he deemed\n\ncapital murder an “appropriate” punishment, not an “automatic” punishment.\n\n      Furthermore, Reading’s voir dire reflects that he understood and fully\n\naccepted the State’s burden of proof at guilt/innocence and on the punishment\n\nissues. Reading confirmed he could “absolutely” hold the State to its burden of\n\nproof of beyond a reasonable doubt and not put any burden on the defense. (RR\n\n11: 172). Reading understood, and agreed, that he should find the defendant “not\n\nguilty” if the State failed in its burden of proof, even if the defendant presented no\n\nevidence. (RR 11: 172-173). As for the factors relevant to the first punishment\n\n\n\n                                          60\n\fissue, Reading understood the State’s continued burden of proof on those issues\n\nand that the defendant had no burden with regard to that issue. (RR 11: 175-176).\n\n      The State acknowledges that Reading answered affirmatively in response to\n\ndefense counsel’s question “you would want the Defense to bring you -- bring you\n\nsome evidence to convince you that death is not the appropriate sentence, correct?”\n\n(RR 11: 191). Yet, this was an isolated portion of Reading’s voir dire, and defense\n\ncounsel had not explained the burden of proof to Reading prior to this question;\n\nnor had the defense asked Reading whether he could follow the law once properly\n\nexplained to him. Gonzales, 353 S.W.3d at 832; Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744.\n\nThus, Reading was not challengeable for cause based on that single response.\n\n      Appellant’s second point of error is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n\n     STATE’S REPLY TO APPELLANT’S THIRD POINT OF ERROR\n\n      Appellant\t\r  failed\t\r  to\t\r  preserve\t\r  any\t\r  alleged\t\r  error\t\r  for\t\r  review\t\r  because\t\r  \n      there\t\r  was\t\r  no\t\r  adverse\t\r  ruling.\t\r  \t\r  Alternatively,\t\r  the\t\r  trial\t\r  court\t\r  did\t\r  not\t\r  \n      abuse\t\r  its\t\r  discretion\t\r  in\t\r  limiting\t\r  the\t\r  voir\t\r  dire\t\r  hearing\t\r  to\t\r  the\t\r  expert’s\t\r  \n      qualifications\t\r  and\t\r  the\t\r  basis\t\r  of\t\r  her\t\r  findings.\t\r  \n\nRelevant Facts\n\n      Prior to Dr. Mauro testifying for the State in rebuttal at the punishment\n\nphase, appellant requested and was granted a hearing on her qualifications. (RR\n\n26: 6). The State questioned Dr. Mauro about her educational and professional\n\nbackground. (RR 26: 6-8). Then, on his voir dire examination, appellant asked Dr.\n\n\n\n                                                     61\n\fMauro to summarize her findings regarding him. (RR 26: 8). The trial judge\n\ninterjected that the voir dire was to be on Dr. Mauro’s qualifications, and appellant\n\nagreed. (RR 26: 8-9). Appellant stated that he might want to suppress some of Dr.\n\nMauro’s findings, and he contended he had a right to question the scientific basis\n\nfor her findings. (RR 26: 9). The trial judge confirmed that appellant had the right\n\nto question Dr. Mauro about the basis of her findings and her expertise, but he did\n\nnot have the right to a hearing as to her specific findings. (RR 26: 9). Appellant\n\nrequested the opportunity to check the rule regarding his right, which the trial\n\njudge allowed. (RR 26: 9). The record reflects defense counsel conferred,\n\nproffered no further argument or objection, and then proceeded to question Dr.\n\nMauro about the basis for her findings. (RR 26: 10). After briefly questioning Dr.\n\nMauro, appellant stated he had no objection to her testimony. (RR 26: 11).\n\n\nAppellant Failed to Preserve Any Alleged Error for Review\n\n      Appellant initially requested a hearing outside the jury’s presence on Dr.\n\nMauro’s qualifications, and the trial judge granted him that hearing. (RR 26: 6).\n\nWhen appellant asked Dr. Mauro about her specific findings, the trial judge\n\ninterjected that the purpose of the hearing was to examine Dr. Mauro’s\n\nqualifications. (RR 26: 8). Appellant agreed. (RR 26: 9). But, appellant\n\ncontended he had “the right to question whether there is a scientific basis to her\n\n\n\n\n                                         62\n\ffindings prior to her testifying about those findings.” 27 (RR 26: 9). The trial judge\n\nagreed that appellant could ask Dr. Mauro about the basis of her findings but\n\nwithout going into her specific findings. (RR 26: 9). Appellant requested to check\n\nthe rule, which the trial judge allowed. (RR 26: 9). Appellant proceeded with the\n\nhearing without any further objection or request to query Dr. Mauro on her specific\n\nfindings. There being no adverse rulings, appellant failed to present any alleged\n\nerror for review. Tex.R.App.Proc. 33.1(a); Fuller v.

Appellant’s third point of error\n\nshould be overruled on procedural default grounds.\n\n\nThe Trial Judge Afforded Appellant a Proper Rule 705(b) Hearing\n\n       Texas Rule of Evidence 705(b) provides:\n\n       Voir Dire. Prior to the expert giving the expert’s opinion or disclosing the\n       underlying facts or data, a party against whom the opinion is offered upon\n       request in a criminal case shall, or in a civil case may, be permitted to\n       conduct a voir dire examination directed to the underlying facts or data upon\n       which the opinion is based.

By\n\nits express terms, Rule 705(b) does not authorize inquiry into the expert’s specific\n\nfindings. It allows inquiry into the underlying basis of the expert’s opinion, which\n\nthe trial judge allowed in this case. The record reflects that the trial judge\n\ncomplied with the requisites of Rule 705(b), and appellant fails to show any\n\nalleged error.\n\n      Appellant’s third point of error is wholly without merit and should be\n\noverruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          64\n\f                                      PRAYER\n\n      WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the State prays this Court to\n\noverrule the appellant’s points of error and to affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n                                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                ROSEMARY LEHMBERG\n                                                District Attorney\n                                                Travis County, Texas\n\n\n                                                /s/ Lisa Stewart\n                                                Lisa Stewart\n                                                Assistant District Attorney\n                                                State Bar No. 06022700\n                                                P.O.
