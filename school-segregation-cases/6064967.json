Lewis argued the cause for appellants. With him on\nthe brief was A. Katherine Toomey.\n\n     Sarah Carroll, Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice,\nargued the cause for appellees. With her on the brief were\nBenjamin C. Mizer, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney\nGeneral at the time the brief was filed, and H. Thomas Byron,\nIII, Attorney.\n\n   Before: ROGERS and SRINIVASAN, Circuit Judges, and\nEDWARDS, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\f                                2\n   Opinion for the Court filed by Senior Circuit Judge\nEDWARDS.\n\n     EDWARDS, Senior Circuit Judge: In 2015, the Department\nof Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\n(“FinCEN”) suspected that Banca Privada d’Andorra S.A.\n(“the Bank”) was being used to launder money. Pursuant to\nSection 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, FinCEN issued a\nNotice of Finding and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the\n“Notices”) proposing to cut off the Bank’s ties to the United\nStates’ financial system. Without completing the rulemaking\nprocess that these Notices contemplated, FinCEN effectively\nachieved its goals when the Andorran Government seized the\nassets of the Bank and began a process to sell off those assets.\n\n     After the Andorran Government took control of the Bank,\nAppellants – the majority shareholders of the Bank – filed suit\nin the District Court, claiming that FinCEN violated the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) in issuing the Notices.\nAppellants’ complaint sought two principal remedies: (1) an\norder requiring FinCEN to withdraw the Notices, and (2) a\ndeclaration that the Notices were unlawfully issued. While the\ncase was pending before the District Court, FinCEN, satisfied\nthat the Bank no longer posed a money laundering concern,\nwithdrew both Notices. The District Court then granted\nFinCEN’s motion to dismiss on the grounds that the case was\nmoot. Appellants filed an appeal from that judgment.\nSubsequent to the District Court’s decision, the Andorran\nGovernment finalized the sale of the Bank’s assets to a private\ninvestment firm.\n\n    We agree with the District Court that this case should be\ndismissed, but for different reasons. When FinCEN withdrew\nthe Notices, Appellants received full relief on their first claim.\nTherefore, we agree that Appellants’ first claim for relief is\n\f                               3\nmoot. Appellants’ second claim for relief – a declaration that\nthe Notices were unlawful – is not moot, but they no longer\nhave standing to press this claim.\n\n    When Appellants first filed their law suit, they had standing\nto challenge the legality of the Notices. However, once their\nclaim for the withdrawal of the Notices became moot,\nAppellants had the burden to show that they still had standing\nto seek a declaratory order that the Notices were unlawful.\nThey have not met this burden. Even assuming that Appellants\nhave the requisite injury and causation to support standing, they\nhave not shown that a judicial order will effectively redress\ntheir alleged injuries. We therefore dismiss the case because\nAppellants’ first claim is moot and they lack standing to pursue\ntheir second claim.\n\n                    I.      BACKGROUND\n\nA. Statutory Framework\n\n    Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act (“the Act”)\nauthorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, upon a finding that a\nforeign financial institution is “of primary money laundering\nconcern,” to impose “special measures” upon any domestic\nfinancial institution that does business with the foreign\ninstitution. 31 U.S.C. § 5318A(b). The Secretary has delegated\nhis authority under Section 311 to FinCEN, a bureau of the\nDepartment of Treasury. 31 C.F.R. § 1010.810(a). The Act\nprovides, inter alia, that:\n\n   In making a finding that reasonable grounds exist for\n   concluding that a jurisdiction outside of the United\n   States [or] 1 or more financial institutions operating\n   outside of the United States . . . is of primary money\n   laundering concern so as to authorize the Secretary of\n   the Treasury to take 1 or more of the special measures\n\f                                4\n   described in subsection (b), the Secretary shall consult\n   with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General.\n\n31 U.S.C. § 5318A(c)(1). The Act also states that “the\nSecretary shall consider [additional] information [determined]\nto be relevant,” including a number of “Jurisdictional” and\n“Institutional” factors listed in the statute. Id.\n§ 5318A(c)(2)(A), (B).\n\n    If FinCEN determines that a foreign institution is of\nprimary money laundering concern, Section 311 authorizes\nFinCEN to take one or more of five special measures. Four of\nthese special measures – including recordkeeping and\ninformation disclosure requirements – may be imposed by\nFinCEN “by regulation, order, or otherwise as permitted by\nlaw.” Id. § 5318A(a)(2)(B). The fifth, and most severe,\nmeasure that FinCEN may take against a foreign institution is\nto prohibit the “opening or maintaining in the United States of\na correspondent account or payable-through account by any\ndomestic financial institution . . . for or on behalf of [that]\nforeign banking institution.” Id. § 5318A(b)(5). “[I]mposing\nthis measure has the effect of eliminating or curtailing a foreign\nbanking institution’s access to the U.S. financial system and to\ntransactions involving the U.S. dollar.” FBME Bank Ltd. v.\nLew, 125 F. Supp. 3d 109, 115 (D.D.C. 2015). As such, the fifth\nspecial measure “can be a ‘death sentence’ for smaller foreign\nbanks who depend on access to U.S. dollar clearing through\ncorrespondent accounts.” STEVEN MARK LEVY, FEDERAL\nMONEY LAUNDERING REGULATION: BANKING, CORPORATE\nAND SECURITIES COMPLIANCE § 30.03(E) (2d ed. Supp. 2017).\n\n    Unlike the other four special measures, the fifth measure\nmay only be imposed “by regulation.” 31 U.S.C.\n§ 5318A(a)(2)(C). The APA requires FinCEN to publish a\n“notice of proposed rule making . . . in the Federal Register,”\n\f                               5\nallowing interested parties an opportunity to comment. 5\nU.S.C. § 553(b)–(c). FinCEN must then publish a final rule to\ngive effect to the special measure. See, e.g., 31 C.F.R.\n§ 1010.659 (imposing the fifth special measure against North\nKorean financial institutions).\n\n     In practice, however, FinCEN often achieves the intended\neffects of the fifth special measure before it completes the\nrulemaking process. The Government Accountability Office\nhas explained that,\n\n   once a proposed rule is issued, almost all U.S. financial\n   institutions immediately implement it voluntarily,\n   stopping financial transactions with designated\n   financial institutions or jurisdictions. . . . U.S. banks\n   often treat proposed Section 311 rules as final and\n   generally cut off all financial interactions with the\n   targeted institution. . . . U.S. banks may be taking this\n   action because the proposed rule is associated with a\n   finding of primary money laundering concern and, in\n   many instances, Treasury issued a finding together\n   with a notice of proposed rule-making. Because it\n   makes good business sense to protect banks from risks\n   to their reputation and possible government penalties,\n   banks may discontinue business with other banks\n   labeled a primary money laundering concern to reduce\n   their reputational risk.\n\nU.S. GOV’T ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE, GAO-08-1058, USA\nPATRIOT ACT: BETTER INTERAGENCY COORDINATION AND\nIMPLEMENTING GUIDANCE FOR SECTION 311 COULD IMPROVE\nU.S. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORTS 21 (2008), Joint\nAppendix (“JA”) 236. A notice proposing to impose the fifth\nspecial measure often has effects overseas, as well, as\nillustrated by the fact that “several foreign governments have\n\f                               6\nstrengthened their laws and regulations in response to proposed\nrules.” Id. at 22, JA 237.\n\n     When FinCEN is able to achieve the objective of imposing\nthe fifth special measure without completing rulemaking, the\nagency typically withdraws the notice of proposed rulemaking.\nSee, e.g., Withdrawal of the Proposed Rulemaking Against\nLebanese Canadian Bank SAL, 80 Fed. Reg. 60,575 (Oct. 7,\n2015).\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n     Appellants Ramon and Higini Cierco were the majority\nshareholders in Banca Privada d’Andorra S.A., a private bank\nin the country of Andorra that held less than two billion euro in\nassets in 2015. See Cierco v. Lew, 190 F. Supp. 3d 16, 18\n(D.D.C. 2016) (describing the ownership structure of the\nBank); Notice of Finding That Banca Privada d’Andorra Is a\nFinancial Institution of Primary Money Laundering Concern,\n80 Fed. Reg. 13,464, 13,464 (Mar. 6, 2015) (“Notice of\nFinding”) (reporting that the Bank held “1.79 billion euro in\nassets”).\n\n     In March 2015, FinCEN issued its Notice of Finding\nalleging that the Bank had “facilitated financial transactions on\nbehalf of Third-Party Money Launderers . . . providing services\nfor individuals and organizations involved in organized crime,\ncorruption, smuggling, and fraud.” Notice of Finding, 80 Fed.\nReg. at 13,464. FinCEN claimed that the Bank “fail[ed] to\nconduct adequate due diligence on customer accounts” and\nprovided “high-risk services to shell companies” – features that\nmade the Bank “highly attractive and well known to [Third-\nParty Money Launderers].” Id. at 13,465.\n\f                              7\n     The same day that FinCEN published the Notice of\nFinding, it also published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to\nimpose the fifth special measure. Imposition of Special\nMeasure Against Banca Privada d’Andorra as a Financial\nInstitution of Primary Money Laundering Concern (“NPRM”),\n80 Fed. Reg. 13,304 (Mar. 13, 2015). The NPRM stated that\nthe fifth special measure was necessary to address the primary\nmoney laundering concern and that it would not impose “an\nundue regulatory burden” because “only four U.S. covered\nfinancial institutions maintain an account for [the Bank].” Id.\nat 13,305.\n\n    One day after FinCEN announced that it was preparing to\ntake action against the Bank, the Andorran Government\ndeclared that it would seize control of the Bank. See Press\nRelease, Institut Nacional Andorrá de Finances (Mar. 11,\n2015), JA 286. In April 2015, the Andorran Government\nappointed a new administrator for the Bank. See Press Release,\nAgency for the Restructuring of Financial Entities (“AREB”),\nAREB Assumes the Tutelage of BPA (Apr. 27, 2015), JA 288.\nThen, a few months later, the Andorran Government created a\nnew bank (“Vall Banc”), to which it transferred the lawful\nassets of Banca Privada d’Andorra, in preparation to sell off\nthose assets. See Press Release, AREB, The Board of the\nAREB Creates the New Bank Named Vall Banc (July 22,\n2015), JA 290. The Andorran Government stated that Vall\nBanc would be a “bridge institution.” Press Release, AREB,\nThe AREB Will Create a “Good Bank” With Legitimate Assets\nand Liabilities Segregated From BPA (June 15, 2015), JA 294.\nThis meant that, as it operated Vall Banc, the Government\nwould “strict[ly] review” the assets of Banca Privada\nd’Andorra to determine which assets were lawful and which\nwere tainted by money laundering. See id.\n\f                               8\n     On October 7, 2015, after the Government of Andorra had\ntransferred the Bank’s assets to Vall Banc and while it was\nreviewing those assets in preparation for sale, Appellants filed\nsuit in the District Court. They claimed that FinCEN’s issuance\nof the Notices was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the\nAPA, because FinCEN did not consider relevant evidence,\nrelied on inaccurate evidence, and imposed a disproportionate\npenalty. See Complaint at 35–38, Cierco v. Lew, No. 15-cv-\n1641 (D.D.C. Oct. 7, 2015), ECF No. 1, JA 45–48. Appellants\nalso claimed that FinCEN violated their Due Process rights and\nexceeded the scope of its delegated authority. See id. at 38–42,\nJA 48–52. Finally, although Appellants’ complaint sought a\nnumber of remedies, their two principal claims for relief were:\n(1) an order requiring FinCEN to withdraw the Notices, and (2)\na declaration that the Notices were unlawfully issued. Id. at 43,\nJA 53. These two claims for relief frame the issues that are\nbefore the court on this appeal.\n\n    On January 25, 2016, FinCEN filed a motion to dismiss,\nclaiming, inter alia, that Appellants lacked standing because\nthe Andorran Government’s seizure of the Bank’s assets could\nnot be redressed by the District Court. See Memorandum in\nSupport of the Motion to Dismiss 9–12, Cierco v. Lew, No. 15-\ncv-1641 (D.D.C. Jan. 25, 2016), ECF No. 29-1.\n\n    On March 4, 2016, FinCEN announced that it was\nwithdrawing both its Notice of Finding and Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking, citing “[s]ignificant developments” ensuring that\nthe Bank “is no longer operating as a financial institution that\nposes a money laundering threat to the U.S. financial system.”\nWithdrawal of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding\nBanca Privada d’Andorra, 81 Fed. Reg. 11,496, 11,497 (Mar.\n4, 2016) (“Notice of Withdrawal”); see also Withdrawal of\nFinding Regarding Banca Privada d’Andorra, 81 Fed. Reg.\n11,648 (Mar. 4, 2016) (withdrawal of Notice of Finding).\n\f                               9\nThose developments included the Andorran Government’s\n“control of [the Bank],” “the creation of the bridge bank,” and\nthe planned sale of that bank. Notice of Withdrawal, 81 Fed.\nReg. at 11,497. FinCEN filed a notice of this withdrawal with\nthe District Court on February 19, 2016, arguing that the case\n“should also be dismissed as moot.” Cierco, 190 F. Supp. 3d at\n21. The District Court ordered supplemental briefing on the\nquestion of mootness. Id. at 22.\n\n     While the parties were filing their supplemental briefs, the\nAndorran Government selected J.C. Flowers & Company, a\nUnited States-based investment firm, as the acquirer of Vall\nBanc. See Br. for Appellees at 14; see also Press Release,\nAREB, AREB Selects US Investment Firm J.C. Flowers & Co.\nas     Buyer     of    Vall     Banc      (Apr.   21,     2016),\nhttp://areb.ad/images/areb/comunicats/21042016_AREB_EN\nG.pdf.\n\n    Then, on May 18, 2016, the District Court granted\nFinCEN’s supplemental motion to dismiss. Cierco, 190 F.\nSupp. 3d 16. The District Court found that the case was moot,\nand that neither the doctrine of “voluntary cessation” nor the\ndoctrine of “capable-of-repetition-yet-evading review” barred\nsuch a finding. Id. at 23–28. On July 14, 2016, after the\nissuance of the District Court’s decision, the Andorran\nGovernment finalized the sale of Vall Banc to J.C. Flowers.\nPress Release, AREB, AREB Transfers Vall Banc to US\nInvestment Firm J.C. Flowers & Co. (July 14, 2016),\nhttp://areb.ad/images/areb/comunicats/14072016_AREB_EN\nG.pdf). Appellants now appeal the District Court’s decision.\n\f                                10\n                       II.     ANALYSIS\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n    We review de novo the District Court’s grant of FinCEN’s\nmotion to dismiss. See Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in\nWash. v. Office of Admin., 566 F.3d 219, 221 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\nB. Summary of the Analysis\n\n    We agree with the District Court’s ultimate decision to\ndismiss this case. However, we do not agree that the disposition\nof Appellants’ claims can rest solely on mootness.\n\n     The case is undoubtedly moot with respect to Appellants’\nfirst claim for relief – a request that FinCEN withdraw the\nNotices. At oral argument, Appellants’ agreed that their request\nfor relief on their first claim has been fully satisfied. Oral Arg.\nat 7:15-7:45, 14:00-14:15. Therefore, there is no live dispute\nleft on this claim.\n\n    Appellants’ second claim for relief – a request for a\ndeclaration that the Notices were unlawful – is not moot,\nhowever. Nonetheless, as we explain below, Appellants no\nlonger have standing to pursue this claim.\n\nC. Appellants’ First Claim for Relief is Moot\n\n     As noted above, Appellants have conceded that they\nreceived all of the relief that they requested on the first claim\nfor relief in their complaint. FinCEN “rescind[ed] the [Notice\nof Finding] and set[] aside the [Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking].” Complaint at 43, JA 53. These actions by\nFinCEN completely vitiated the Notices.\n\f                               11\n     “Because the exercise of judicial power under Article III\ndepends upon the existence of a case or controversy, a federal\ncourt may not render advisory opinions or decide questions that\ndo not affect the rights of parties properly before it.” EDWARDS,\nELLIOTT, & LEVY, FEDERAL STANDARDS OF REVIEW 134 (2d\ned. 2013) (citing North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 246\n(1971) (per curiam)). If a case is moot, the court must dismiss\nit for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n       There are two principal exceptions to mootness.\n   The first pertains to situations in which “the challenged\n   action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated\n   prior to its cessation or expiration,” yet there is a\n   “demonstrated probability that the same controversy\n   will recur involving the same complaining party.”\n   Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 482 (1982) (per\n   curiam).\n\n   ....\n\n       The second principal exception involves a party’s\n   “voluntary cessation” of the challenged activity. As a\n   general rule, a defendant’s “voluntary cessation of\n   allegedly illegal conduct does not deprive [a court] of\n   power to hear and determine the case.” Cty. of Los\n   Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979). Voluntary\n   cessation will only moot a case if “there is no\n   reasonable expectation . . . that the alleged violation\n   will recur” and “interim relief or events have\n   completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of\n   the alleged violation.” Id. The defendant carries the\n   burden of demonstrating “that there is no reasonable\n   expectation that the wrong will be repeated,” and “[t]he\n   burden is a heavy one.” United States v. W. T. Grant\n   Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953).\n\f                              12\nId. at 135. Neither exception applies here.\n\n     The capable of repetition, yet evading review exception to\nmootness applies only “where (1) the challenged action is in its\nduration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or\nexpiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the\nsame complaining party will be subject to the same action\nagain.” Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 735 (2008) (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Appellants make no claim\nthat these conditions exist here.\n\n      The voluntary cessation exception also does not apply\nhere. The Government has assured the court that the disputed\nNotices have been completely withdrawn. Br. for Appellees at\n18, 28. Appellants do not contest this. Indeed, Appellants have\nnever even suggested that there is any likelihood that FinCEN\nwill reissue the withdrawn Notices. See Cierco, 190 F. Supp.\n3d at 24 (recognizing “Plaintiffs’ own failure to argue that the\ngovernment will impose the fifth special measure on [the Bank]\nin the future”). Nor could they plausibly advance such a claim.\nAfter the Bank was seized by the Andorran Government and\nits assets were transferred to Vall Banc, FinCEN concluded that\nthe Bank “is no longer operating as a financial institution that\nposes a money laundering threat to the U.S. financial system.”\nNotice of Withdrawal, 81 Fed. Reg. at 11,497. Given these\ncircumstances, and the subsequent finalization of the sale of\nVall Banc to J.C. Flowers, Appellants cannot now show that\nthey are likely to suffer the same injury in the future.\n\n   Therefore, on the record before us, it is quite clear that\nAppellants’ first claim – that the Notices be withdrawn – is\nmoot.\n\f                                13\nD. The Framework for Analyzing Appellants’ Standing\n\n    As the Court explained in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n\n    the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\n    contains three elements. First, the plaintiff must have\n    suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally\n    protected interest which is (a) concrete and\n    particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not\n    conjectural or hypothetical. Second, there must be a\n    causal connection between the injury and the conduct\n    complained of—the injury has to be fairly . . . traceable\n    to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . .\n    the result of the independent action of some third party\n    not before the court. Third, it must be likely, as\n    opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be\n    redressed by a favorable decision.\n\n504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (citations, internal quotation\nmarks, and brackets omitted).\n\n     “Standing can be raised at any point in a case proceeding\nand, as a jurisdictional matter, may be raised, sua sponte, by\nthe court.” Steffan v. Perry, 41 F.3d 677, 697 n.20 (D.C. Cir.\n1994) (en banc). Indeed, we have a “special obligation to\n‘satisfy [ourselves] . . . of [our] own jurisdiction.’” Steel Co. v.\nCitizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 95 (1998) (quoting\nBender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541\n(1986)). Where a party’s “Article III standing is unclear,” we\n“must resolve the doubt, sua sponte if need be.” Lee’s Summit\nv. Surface Transp. Bd., 231 F.3d 39, 41 (D.C. Cir. 2000)\n(emphasis added).\n\n    “[A] plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for\neach form of relief sought.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.\n\f                               14\nLaidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000)\n(citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109 (1983)).\nAs explained above, Appellants requested two principal forms\nof relief in their complaint. Their first claim – that the Notices\nbe withdrawn – is moot. So the matter of standing with respect\nto this claim is of no moment. Appellants’ second claim – their\nrequest for a declaration that the Notices were illegal – is not\nmoot. Given these circumstances, we must consider whether\nAppellants still have standing to raise it. The Court’s decision\nin Lyons establishes the framework for our analysis.\n\n     In Lyons, the plaintiff sought damages, an injunction, and\ndeclaratory relief after police officers injured him in a\nchokehold. 461 U.S. at 97–98. During the course of the\nlitigation, the Los Angeles Police Department implemented a\nsix-month moratorium on the use of chokeholds, and Los\nAngeles then suggested that the case may be moot. Id. at 100–\n01. The Court acknowledged that, although the plaintiff “still\nha[d] a claim for damages against [Los Angeles] that\nappear[ed] to meet all Art. III requirements,” he no longer had\nstanding to pursue his request for injunctive relief because of\nthe “speculative nature of his claim that he will again\nexperience injury.” Id. at 109. “[T]he issue here is not whether\n[the damages] claim has become moot but whether Lyons\nmeets the preconditions for asserting an injunctive claim in a\nfederal forum.” Id.\n\n     Lyons points the way to understanding that when one of a\nplaintiff’s requests for relief is no longer live – either because\nthat relief is granted, the parties have settled, or the claim has\notherwise become moot – a natural issue that arises is whether\nthe plaintiff has standing to pursue related, remaining requests\nfor relief. Lyons followed the approach taken by the Court in\nDeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974), and Super Tire\nEngineering Co. v. McCorkle, 416 U.S. 115 (1974), and the\n\f                                15\nprinciples that evolved have been followed by the courts ever\nsince.\n\n     The Court’s decision in Summers v. Earth Island Institute,\n555 U.S. 488 (2009), is another good example. Plaintiffs in that\ncase filed suit against the United States Forest Service for\nfailing to apply notice-and-comment procedures when it\napproved the “Burnt Ridge Project.” Id. at 491. Plaintiffs also\nchallenged the underlying Forest Service regulations. Id.\nDuring the course of litigation, the parties “settled their\ndispute” regarding the Burnt Ridge Project specifically, but\nplaintiffs continued to press their challenge to the underlying\nregulations. Id. at 491–92. The Court, citing Lyons, found that\nplaintiffs lacked standing to bring their remaining requested\nrelief:\n\n    We know of no precedent for the proposition that when\n    a plaintiff has sued to challenge the lawfulness of\n    certain action or threatened action but has settled that\n    suit, he retains standing to challenge the basis for that\n    action (here, the regulation in the abstract), apart from\n    any concrete application that threatens imminent harm\n    to his interests.\n\nId. at 494. After holding that plaintiffs’ first request for relief\nwas moot, the Court analyzed plaintiffs’ standing to continue\nlitigating their remaining request. As suggested in Lyons, the\ncentral framework was clear: when plaintiffs settled one of\ntheir requests for relief, the natural question became whether\nthey had standing to press for the additional remedies that had\nbeen sought in the complaint.\n\n     Our own case law is perfectly consistent with this line of\ncases. See, e.g., Maydak v. United States, 630 F.3d 166 (D.C.\nCir. 2010) (holding that prisoners lacked standing to continue\n\f                               16\nchallenging an Inmate Trust Fund after they were released from\ncustody); Better Gov’t Ass’n v. Dep’t of State, 780 F.2d 86\n(D.C. Cir. 1986) (holding that plaintiffs had standing to\ncontinue pressing their facial challenge to government\nguidelines even after being awarded a fee waiver in connection\nwith their request under the Freedom of Information Act\nbecause they were frequent FOIA requesters who would be\naffected by the guidelines in the future and the challenge was\nripe for judicial review).\n\n     As the Court made clear in Summers, when a plaintiff has\nsued to challenge the lawfulness of certain action or threatened\naction but that portion of the action is rendered moot, the\nplaintiff does not retain standing to challenge the regulation\nthat was the basis for that action apart from any concrete\napplication that threatens imminent harm to his interests. 555\nU.S. at 494. We must now determine whether Appellants still\nhave standing to seek a declaration that the disputed Notices\nwere unlawful even though the Notices have been withdrawn.\n\nE. Appellants Lack Standing to Pursue Their Second Claim\n   for Relief\n\n     Appellants’ second claim for relief seeks a “decision\nholding that the [Notices] were issued unlawfully.” Br. of\nAppellants at 21. Even if we assume that Appellants have\ncognizable injuries and can show causation to support standing,\nthey have not demonstrated that it is “likely, as opposed to\nmerely speculative, that the[ir] injur[ies] will be redressed by a\nfavorable decision” from this court. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     In assessing Appellants’ standing, although we “accept\nthe[ir] well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all\nreasonable inferences from those allegations in [their] favor,”\n\f                              17\nwe do not “accept inferences that are unsupported by the facts\nset out in the complaint.” Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 19\n(D.C. Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\nIslamic Am. Relief Agency v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 728, 732\n(D.C. Cir. 2007)). We hold that Appellants lack standing\nbecause the redress that they seek is far too speculative to\nsupport their invocation of federal court jurisdiction.\n\n    In their brief to this court, Appellants attempt to explain\nhow a decision from this court holding that the two Notices\nwere unlawful would redress their injuries:\n\n   [T]here is a substantial likelihood that a decision\n   finding that FinCEN improperly labeled [the Bank] as\n   of “primary money laundering concern” would\n   materially impact the position of Andorran authorities\n   as to the proper course to be followed with respect to\n   the sale of [the Bank’s] assets, what should be done\n   with the corporate structure and any assets that remain,\n   and how the Ciercos, as [the Bank’s] owners, should\n   now be treated in the process.\n\nBr. of Appellants at 30. This explanation suffers from both\nfactual and legal infirmities.\n\n     First, with regard to the assets transferred to the bridge\nbank, the window of time to “impact the position of Andorran\nauthorities” has closed. On July 14, 2016, after having\ntransferred the Bank’s assets to the Government-run bridge\ninstitution, the Andorran Government finalized the sale of the\nassets. Press Release, AREB, AREB Transfers Vall Banc to US\nInvestment Firm J.C. Flowers & Co. (July 14, 2016),\nhttp://areb.ad/images/areb/comunicats/14072016_AREB_EN\nG.pdf). Appellants do not dispute the facts proffered by\nAppellees to show that the Bank’s assets had been seized and\n\f                               18\nsold. See Br. for Appellees at 10–12. The record thus indicates\nthat the Bank’s assets have been out of the hands of the\nAndorran Government for nearly a year now, and Appellants\nfail to offer any path of events by which the Andorran\nGovernment could or would unwind the sale.\n\n     Second, Appellants may be correct that FinCEN’s Notices\n“indisputably prompted Andorra’s actions against [the Bank].”\nBr. of Appellants at 31. Even were that the case, however, it is\nfar from clear that a declaration that FinCEN violated the APA\nin promulgating the Notices would cause Andorra to reverse\ncourse. Appellants offer only conjecture, but no evidence,\nsuggesting that the Andorran Government would be influenced\nby such a declaration to undo the sale of Vall Banc to J.C.\nFlowers or to return any assets still held by the Government.\nAppellants are effectively asking this court to “accept\ninferences that are unsupported by the facts set out in the\ncomplaint.” Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 19 (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted). Appellants have offered no evidence\nthat the Andorran Government would reverse course as a result\nof the withdrawal of FinCEN’s Notices. And they have not\nshown that the sale actually could be undone even if the\nAndorran Government were so inclined.\n\n     Third, Appellants contend that, in rejecting their claim, the\nDistrict Court erred in “consider[ing] facts beyond the\npleadings.” Br. for Appellants at 34. Appellants appear to be\nreferring to the information about political developments in\nAndorra that took place after Appellants filed their complaint.\nIn any event, their contention is misguided. We have made it\nclear that, “[i]n determining standing, we may consider\nmaterials outside of the complaint.” Food & Water Watch, Inc.\nv. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 913 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Indeed,\nAppellants apparently understand this because, during oral\nargument before this court, they asserted that the Andorran\n\f                               19\nGovernment still holds “1.5 billion euros” of the Bank’s assets.\nOral Arg. at 16:50-17:10. But the assertion was not supported\nby any evidence.\n\n     Finally, and most importantly, even as we view all of the\nrelevant facts in the light most favorable to Appellants, we find\nthat their arguments in support of redressability are much too\nspeculative to support standing. We are particularly disinclined\n“to endorse standing theories that rest on speculation about the\ndecisions of independent actors.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l\nUSA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1150 (2013). It is well understood that\nstanding is “substantially more difficult to establish” when it\n“depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors\nnot before the courts and whose exercise of broad and\nlegitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to\ncontrol or to predict.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562 (quoting Allen v.\nWright, 468 U.S. 737, 758 (1984); ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490\nU.S. 605, 615 (1989) (opinion of Kennedy, J.)). In such cases,\nthe plaintiff must offer “substantial evidence of a causal\nrelationship between the government policy and the third-party\nconduct, leaving little doubt as to causation and the likelihood\nof redress.” Renal Physicians Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of Health &\nHuman Servs., 489 F.3d 1267, 1275 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (citation\nand internal quotation marks omitted). Appellants have offered\nno such evidence.\n\n     We have been particularly reluctant to find standing where\nthe third party upon whose conduct redressability depends is a\nforeign sovereign. See, e.g., Dellums v. U.S. Nuclear\nRegulatory Comm’n, 863 F.2d 968, 976 (D.C. Cir. 1988)\n(noting that “[o]ur own decisions . . . have declined to\nrecognize standing when the effectiveness of the relief\nrequested depends on the unforeseeable actions of a foreign\nnation”); Cardenas v. Smith, 733 F.2d 909, 914 (D.C. Cir.\n1984) (holding that plaintiff lacked standing because “the relief\n\f                               20\nin the present case could be obtained only through the consent\nof the Swiss government”).\n\n     As Appellants would have it, a judicial declaration that the\nNotices issued by FinCEN were unlawful would encourage the\nAndorran Government to unwind the seizure of the Bank’s\nassets and the subsequent sale of those assets to J.C. Flowers\nand to return any assets still held by the Government. Their\nclaim thus “depends on the unforeseeable actions” of the\nAndorran Government, which is not enough to support\nredressability. Dellums, 863 F.2d at 976. Appellants offer no\nevidence that the Andorran Government would respond as they\nsuggest. “When redress depends on the cooperation of a third\nparty, it becomes the burden of the [appellant] to adduce facts\nshowing that those choices have been or will be made in such\nmanner as to produce causation and permit redressability of\ninjury.” US Ecology, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 231 F.3d 20,\n24–25 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Appellants have not met this burden.\n\n                     III.    CONCLUSION\n\n    For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the\njudgment of the District Court dismissing Appellants’\ncomplaint. We have no jurisdiction to hear their claims.\n\f",

Pursuant to\nSection 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, FinCEN issued a\nNotice of Finding and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the\n“Notices”) proposing to cut off the Bank’s ties to the United\nStates’ financial system. Without completing the rulemaking\nprocess that these Notices contemplated, FinCEN effectively\nachieved its goals when the Andorran Government seized the\nassets of the Bank and began a process to sell off those assets.\n\n     After the Andorran Government took control of the Bank,\nAppellants – the majority shareholders of the Bank – filed suit\nin the District Court, claiming that FinCEN violated the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) in issuing the Notices.\nAppellants’ complaint sought two principal remedies: (1) an\norder requiring FinCEN to withdraw the Notices, and (2) a\ndeclaration that the Notices were unlawfully issued. While the\ncase was pending before the District Court, FinCEN, satisfied\nthat the Bank no longer posed a money laundering concern,\nwithdrew both Notices. The District Court then granted\nFinCEN’s motion to dismiss on the grounds that the case was\nmoot. Appellants filed an appeal from that judgment.\nSubsequent to the District Court’s decision, the Andorran\nGovernment finalized the sale of the Bank’s assets to a private\ninvestment firm.\n\n    We agree with the District Court that this case should be\ndismissed, but for different reasons. When FinCEN withdrew\nthe Notices, Appellants received full relief on their first claim.\nTherefore, we agree that Appellants’ first claim for relief is\n\f                               3\nmoot. Appellants’ second claim for relief – a declaration that\nthe Notices were unlawful – is not moot, but they no longer\nhave standing to press this claim.\n\n    When Appellants first filed their law suit, they had standing\nto challenge the legality of the Notices. However, once their\nclaim for the withdrawal of the Notices became moot,\nAppellants had the burden to show that they still had standing\nto seek a declaratory order that the Notices were unlawful.\nThey have not met this burden. Even assuming that Appellants\nhave the requisite injury and causation to support standing, they\nhave not shown that a judicial order will effectively redress\ntheir alleged injuries. We therefore dismiss the case because\nAppellants’ first claim is moot and they lack standing to pursue\ntheir second claim.\n\n                    I.      BACKGROUND\n\nA. Statutory Framework\n\n    Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act (“the Act”)\nauthorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, upon a finding that a\nforeign financial institution is “of primary money laundering\nconcern,” to impose “special measures” upon any domestic\nfinancial institution that does business with the foreign\ninstitution. 31 U.S.C. § 5318A(b). The Secretary has delegated\nhis authority under Section 311 to FinCEN, a bureau of the\nDepartment of Treasury. 31 C.F.R. § 1010.810(a). The Act\nprovides, inter alia, that:\n\n   In making a finding that reasonable grounds exist for\n   concluding that a jurisdiction outside of the United\n   States [or] 1 or more financial institutions operating\n   outside of the United States . . . is of primary money\n   laundering concern so as to authorize the Secretary of\n   the Treasury to take 1 or more of the special measures\n\f                                4\n   described in subsection (b), the Secretary shall consult\n   with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General.\n\n31 U.S.C. § 5318A(c)(1). The Act also states that “the\nSecretary shall consider [additional] information [determined]\nto be relevant,” including a number of “Jurisdictional” and\n“Institutional” factors listed in the statute. Id.\n§ 5318A(c)(2)(A), (B).\n\n    If FinCEN determines that a foreign institution is of\nprimary money laundering concern, Section 311 authorizes\nFinCEN to take one or more of five special measures. Four of\nthese special measures – including recordkeeping and\ninformation disclosure requirements – may be imposed by\nFinCEN “by regulation, order, or otherwise as permitted by\nlaw.” Id. § 5318A(a)(2)(B). The fifth, and most severe,\nmeasure that FinCEN may take against a foreign institution is\nto prohibit the “opening or maintaining in the United States of\na correspondent account or payable-through account by any\ndomestic financial institution . . . for or on behalf of [that]\nforeign banking institution.” Id. § 5318A(b)(5). “[I]mposing\nthis measure has the effect of eliminating or curtailing a foreign\nbanking institution’s access to the U.S. financial system and to\ntransactions involving the U.S. dollar.” FBME Bank Ltd. v.\nLew, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115 (D.D.C. 2015). As such, the fifth\nspecial measure “can be a ‘death sentence’ for smaller foreign\nbanks who depend on access to U.S. dollar clearing through\ncorrespondent accounts.” STEVEN MARK LEVY, FEDERAL\nMONEY LAUNDERING REGULATION: BANKING, CORPORATE\nAND SECURITIES COMPLIANCE § 30.03(E) (2d ed. Supp. 2017).\n\n    Unlike the other four special measures, the fifth measure\nmay only be imposed “by regulation.” 31 U.S.C.\n§ 5318A(a)(2)(C). The APA requires FinCEN to publish a\n“notice of proposed rule making . . . in the Federal Register,”\n\f                               5\nallowing interested parties an opportunity to comment. 5\nU.S.C. § 553(b)–(c). FinCEN must then publish a final rule to\ngive effect to the special measure. See, e.g., 31 C.F.R.\n§ 1010.659 (imposing the fifth special measure against North\nKorean financial institutions).\n\n     In practice, however, FinCEN often achieves the intended\neffects of the fifth special measure before it completes the\nrulemaking process. The Government Accountability Office\nhas explained that,\n\n   once a proposed rule is issued, almost all U.S. financial\n   institutions immediately implement it voluntarily,\n   stopping financial transactions with designated\n   financial institutions or jurisdictions. . . . U.S. banks\n   often treat proposed Section 311 rules as final and\n   generally cut off all financial interactions with the\n   targeted institution. . . . U.S. banks may be taking this\n   action because the proposed rule is associated with a\n   finding of primary money laundering concern and, in\n   many instances, Treasury issued a finding together\n   with a notice of proposed rule-making. Because it\n   makes good business sense to protect banks from risks\n   to their reputation and possible government penalties,\n   banks may discontinue business with other banks\n   labeled a primary money laundering concern to reduce\n   their reputational risk.\n\nU.S. GOV’T ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE, GAO-08-1058, USA\nPATRIOT ACT: BETTER INTERAGENCY COORDINATION AND\nIMPLEMENTING GUIDANCE FOR SECTION 311 COULD IMPROVE\nU.S. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORTS 21 (2008), Joint\nAppendix (“JA”) 236. A notice proposing to impose the fifth\nspecial measure often has effects overseas, as well, as\nillustrated by the fact that “several foreign governments have\n\f                               6\nstrengthened their laws and regulations in response to proposed\nrules.” Id. at 22, JA 237.\n\n     When FinCEN is able to achieve the objective of imposing\nthe fifth special measure without completing rulemaking, the\nagency typically withdraws the notice of proposed rulemaking.\nSee, e.g., Withdrawal of the Proposed Rulemaking Against\nLebanese Canadian Bank SAL, 80 Fed. Reg. 60,575 (Oct. 7,\n2015).\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n     Appellants Ramon and Higini Cierco were the majority\nshareholders in Banca Privada d’Andorra S.A., a private bank\nin the country of Andorra that held less than two billion euro in\nassets in 2015. See Cierco v. Lew, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18\n(D.D.C. 2016) (describing the ownership structure of the\nBank); Notice of Finding That Banca Privada d’Andorra Is a\nFinancial Institution of Primary Money Laundering Concern,\n80 Fed. Reg. 13,464, 13,464 (Mar. 6, 2015) (“Notice of\nFinding”) (reporting that the Bank held “1.79 billion euro in\nassets”).\n\n     In March 2015, FinCEN issued its Notice of Finding\nalleging that the Bank had “facilitated financial transactions on\nbehalf of Third-Party Money Launderers . . . providing services\nfor individuals and organizations involved in organized crime,\ncorruption, smuggling, and fraud.” Notice of Finding, 80 Fed.\nReg. at 13,464. FinCEN claimed that the Bank “fail[ed] to\nconduct adequate due diligence on customer accounts” and\nprovided “high-risk services to shell companies” – features that\nmade the Bank “highly attractive and well known to [Third-\nParty Money Launderers].” Id. at 13,465.\n\f                              7\n     The same day that FinCEN published the Notice of\nFinding, it also published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to\nimpose the fifth special measure. Imposition of Special\nMeasure Against Banca Privada d’Andorra as a Financial\nInstitution of Primary Money Laundering Concern (“NPRM”),\n80 Fed. Reg. 13,304 (Mar. 13, 2015). The NPRM stated that\nthe fifth special measure was necessary to address the primary\nmoney laundering concern and that it would not impose “an\nundue regulatory burden” because “only four U.S. covered\nfinancial institutions maintain an account for [the Bank].” Id.\nat 13,305.\n\n    One day after FinCEN announced that it was preparing to\ntake action against the Bank, the Andorran Government\ndeclared that it would seize control of the Bank. See Press\nRelease, Institut Nacional Andorrá de Finances (Mar. 11,\n2015), JA 286. In April 2015, the Andorran Government\nappointed a new administrator for the Bank. See Press Release,\nAgency for the Restructuring of Financial Entities (“AREB”),\nAREB Assumes the Tutelage of BPA (Apr. 27, 2015), JA 288.\nThen, a few months later, the Andorran Government created a\nnew bank (“Vall Banc”), to which it transferred the lawful\nassets of Banca Privada d’Andorra, in preparation to sell off\nthose assets. See Press Release, AREB, The Board of the\nAREB Creates the New Bank Named Vall Banc (July 22,\n2015), JA 290. The Andorran Government stated that Vall\nBanc would be a “bridge institution.” Press Release, AREB,\nThe AREB Will Create a “Good Bank” With Legitimate Assets\nand Liabilities Segregated From BPA (June 15, 2015), JA 294.\nThis meant that, as it operated Vall Banc, the Government\nwould “strict[ly] review” the assets of Banca Privada\nd’Andorra to determine which assets were lawful and which\nwere tainted by money laundering. See id.\n\f                               8\n     On October 7, 2015, after the Government of Andorra had\ntransferred the Bank’s assets to Vall Banc and while it was\nreviewing those assets in preparation for sale, Appellants filed\nsuit in the District Court. They claimed that FinCEN’s issuance\nof the Notices was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the\nAPA, because FinCEN did not consider relevant evidence,\nrelied on inaccurate evidence, and imposed a disproportionate\npenalty. See Complaint at 35–38, Cierco v. Lew, No. 15-cv-\n1641 (D.D.C. Oct. 7, 2015), ECF No. 1, JA 45–48. Appellants\nalso claimed that FinCEN violated their Due Process rights and\nexceeded the scope of its delegated authority. See id. at 38–42,\nJA 48–52. Finally, although Appellants’ complaint sought a\nnumber of remedies, their two principal claims for relief were:\n(1) an order requiring FinCEN to withdraw the Notices, and (2)\na declaration that the Notices were unlawfully issued. Id. at 43,\nJA 53. These two claims for relief frame the issues that are\nbefore the court on this appeal.\n\n    On January 25, 2016, FinCEN filed a motion to dismiss,\nclaiming, inter alia, that Appellants lacked standing because\nthe Andorran Government’s seizure of the Bank’s assets could\nnot be redressed by the District Court.

Standard of Review\n\n    We review de novo the District Court’s grant of FinCEN’s\nmotion to dismiss. See Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in\nWash. v. Office of Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\nB. Summary of the Analysis\n\n    We agree with the District Court’s ultimate decision to\ndismiss this case. However, we do not agree that the disposition\nof Appellants’ claims can rest solely on mootness.\n\n     The case is undoubtedly moot with respect to Appellants’\nfirst claim for relief – a request that FinCEN withdraw the\nNotices. At oral argument, Appellants’ agreed that their request\nfor relief on their first claim has been fully satisfied. Oral Arg.\nat 7:15-7:45, 14:00-14:15. Therefore, there is no live dispute\nleft on this claim.\n\n    Appellants’ second claim for relief – a request for a\ndeclaration that the Notices were unlawful – is not moot,\nhowever. Nonetheless, as we explain below, Appellants no\nlonger have standing to pursue this claim.\n\nC. Appellants’ First Claim for Relief is Moot\n\n     As noted above, Appellants have conceded that they\nreceived all of the relief that they requested on the first claim\nfor relief in their complaint. FinCEN “rescind[ed] the [Notice\nof Finding] and set[] aside the [Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking].” Complaint at 43, JA 53. These actions by\nFinCEN completely vitiated the Notices.\n\f                               11\n     “Because the exercise of judicial power under Article III\ndepends upon the existence of a case or controversy, a federal\ncourt may not render advisory opinions or decide questions that\ndo not affect the rights of parties properly before it.” EDWARDS,\nELLIOTT, & LEVY, FEDERAL STANDARDS OF REVIEW 134 (2d\ned. 2013) (citing North Carolina v. Rice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108413\"><a href=\"/opinion/108413/north-carolina-v-rice/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 246\n(1971) (per curiam)). If a case is moot, the court must dismiss\nit for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n       There are two principal exceptions to mootness.\n   The first pertains to situations in which “the challenged\n   action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated\n   prior to its cessation or expiration,” yet there is a\n   “demonstrated probability that the same controversy\n   will recur involving the same complaining party.”\n   Murphy v. Hunt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110660\"><a href=\"/opinion/110660/murphy-v-hunt/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 482 (1982) (per\n   curiam).\n\n   ....\n\n       The second principal exception involves a party’s\n   “voluntary cessation” of the challenged activity. As a\n   general rule, a defendant’s “voluntary cessation of\n   allegedly illegal conduct does not deprive [a court] of\n   power to hear and determine the case.” Cty. of Los\n   Angeles v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110044\"><a href=\"/opinion/110044/county-of-los-angeles-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631 (1979). Voluntary\n   cessation will only moot a case if “there is no\n   reasonable expectation . . . that the alleged violation\n   will recur” and “interim relief or events have\n   completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of\n   the alleged violation.” Id. The defendant carries the\n   burden of demonstrating “that there is no reasonable\n   expectation that the wrong will be repeated,” and “[t]he\n   burden is a heavy one.” United States v. W. T. Grant\n   Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105132\"><a href=\"/opinion/105132/united-states-v-wt-grant-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 633 (1953).\n\f                              12\nId. at 135. Neither exception applies here.\n\n     The capable of repetition, yet evading review exception to\nmootness applies only “where (1) the challenged action is in its\nduration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or\nexpiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the\nsame complaining party will be subject to the same action\nagain.” Davis v. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145776\"><a href=\"/opinion/145776/davis-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 735 (2008) (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Appellants make no claim\nthat these conditions exist here.\n\n      The voluntary cessation exception also does not apply\nhere. The Government has assured the court that the disputed\nNotices have been completely withdrawn. Br. for Appellees at\n18, 28. Appellants do not contest this. Indeed, Appellants have\nnever even suggested that there is any likelihood that FinCEN\nwill reissue the withdrawn Notices. See Cierco, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 24 (recognizing “Plaintiffs’ own failure to argue that the\ngovernment will impose the fifth special measure on [the Bank]\nin the future”). Nor could they plausibly advance such a claim.\nAfter the Bank was seized by the Andorran Government and\nits assets were transferred to Vall Banc, FinCEN concluded that\nthe Bank “is no longer operating as a financial institution that\nposes a money laundering threat to the U.S. financial system.”\nNotice of Withdrawal, 81 Fed. Reg. at 11,497. Given these\ncircumstances, and the subsequent finalization of the sale of\nVall Banc to J.C. Flowers, Appellants cannot now show that\nthey are likely to suffer the same injury in the future.\n\n   Therefore, on the record before us, it is quite clear that\nAppellants’ first claim – that the Notices be withdrawn – is\nmoot.\n\f                                13\nD. The Framework for Analyzing Appellants’ Standing\n\n    As the Court explained in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n\n    the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\n    contains three elements. First, the plaintiff must have\n    suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally\n    protected interest which is (a) concrete and\n    particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not\n    conjectural or hypothetical. Second, there must be a\n    causal connection between the injury and the conduct\n    complained of—the injury has to be fairly . . . traceable\n    to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . .\n    the result of the independent action of some third party\n    not before the court. Third, it must be likely, as\n    opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be\n    redressed by a favorable decision.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560–61 (1992) (citations, internal quotation\nmarks, and brackets omitted).\n\n     “Standing can be raised at any point in a case proceeding\nand, as a jurisdictional matter, may be raised, sua sponte, by\nthe court.” Steffan v.

Their first claim – that the Notices\nbe withdrawn – is moot. So the matter of standing with respect\nto this claim is of no moment. Appellants’ second claim – their\nrequest for a declaration that the Notices were illegal – is not\nmoot. Given these circumstances, we must consider whether\nAppellants still have standing to raise it. The Court’s decision\nin Lyons establishes the framework for our analysis.\n\n     In Lyons, the plaintiff sought damages, an injunction, and\ndeclaratory relief after police officers injured him in a\nchokehold. 461 U.S. at 97–98. During the course of the\nlitigation, the Los Angeles Police Department implemented a\nsix-month moratorium on the use of chokeholds, and Los\nAngeles then suggested that the case may be moot. Id. at 100–\n01. The Court acknowledged that, although the plaintiff “still\nha[d] a claim for damages against [Los Angeles] that\nappear[ed] to meet all Art. III requirements,” he no longer had\nstanding to pursue his request for injunctive relief because of\nthe “speculative nature of his claim that he will again\nexperience injury.” Id. at 109. “[T]he issue here is not whether\n[the damages] claim has become moot but whether Lyons\nmeets the preconditions for asserting an injunctive claim in a\nfederal forum.” Id.\n\n     Lyons points the way to understanding that when one of a\nplaintiff’s requests for relief is no longer live – either because\nthat relief is granted, the parties have settled, or the claim has\notherwise become moot – a natural issue that arises is whether\nthe plaintiff has standing to pursue related, remaining requests\nfor relief. Lyons followed the approach taken by the Court in\nDeFunis v. Odegaard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109012\"><a href=\"/opinion/109012/defunis-v-odegaard/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), and Super Tire\nEngineering Co. v.

Earth Island Institute,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145904\"><a href=\"/opinion/145904/summers-v-earth-island-institute/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009), is another good example. Plaintiffs in that\ncase filed suit against the United States Forest Service for\nfailing to apply notice-and-comment procedures when it\napproved the “Burnt Ridge Project.” Id. at 491. Plaintiffs also\nchallenged the underlying Forest Service regulations. Id.\nDuring the course of litigation, the parties “settled their\ndispute” regarding the Burnt Ridge Project specifically, but\nplaintiffs continued to press their challenge to the underlying\nregulations. Id. at 491–92. The Court, citing Lyons, found that\nplaintiffs lacked standing to bring their remaining requested\nrelief:\n\n    We know of no precedent for the proposition that when\n    a plaintiff has sued to challenge the lawfulness of\n    certain action or threatened action but has settled that\n    suit, he retains standing to challenge the basis for that\n    action (here, the regulation in the abstract), apart from\n    any concrete application that threatens imminent harm\n    to his interests.\n\nId. at 494. After holding that plaintiffs’ first request for relief\nwas moot, the Court analyzed plaintiffs’ standing to continue\nlitigating their remaining request. As suggested in Lyons, the\ncentral framework was clear: when plaintiffs settled one of\ntheir requests for relief, the natural question became whether\nthey had standing to press for the additional remedies that had\nbeen sought in the complaint.\n\n     Our own case law is perfectly consistent with this line of\ncases. See, e.g., Maydak v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"181836\"><a href=\"/opinion/181836/maydak-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">630</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.\nCir. 2010) (holding that prisoners lacked standing to continue\n\f                               16\nchallenging an Inmate Trust Fund after they were released from\ncustody); Better Gov’t Ass’n v.

We must now determine whether Appellants still\nhave standing to seek a declaration that the disputed Notices\nwere unlawful even though the Notices have been withdrawn.\n\nE. Appellants Lack Standing to Pursue Their Second Claim\n   for Relief\n\n     Appellants’ second claim for relief seeks a “decision\nholding that the [Notices] were issued unlawfully.” Br. of\nAppellants at 21. Even if we assume that Appellants have\ncognizable injuries and can show causation to support standing,\nthey have not demonstrated that it is “likely, as opposed to\nmerely speculative, that the[ir] injur[ies] will be redressed by a\nfavorable decision” from this court. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     In assessing Appellants’ standing, although we “accept\nthe[ir] well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all\nreasonable inferences from those allegations in [their] favor,”\n\f                              17\nwe do not “accept inferences that are unsupported by the facts\nset out in the complaint.” Arpaio v. Obama, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19\n(D.C.

Cir. 2007)). We hold that Appellants lack standing\nbecause the redress that they seek is far too speculative to\nsupport their invocation of federal court jurisdiction.\n\n    In their brief to this court, Appellants attempt to explain\nhow a decision from this court holding that the two Notices\nwere unlawful would redress their injuries:\n\n   [T]here is a substantial likelihood that a decision\n   finding that FinCEN improperly labeled [the Bank] as\n   of “primary money laundering concern” would\n   materially impact the position of Andorran authorities\n   as to the proper course to be followed with respect to\n   the sale of [the Bank’s] assets, what should be done\n   with the corporate structure and any assets that remain,\n   and how the Ciercos, as [the Bank’s] owners, should\n   now be treated in the process.\n\nBr. of Appellants at 30. This explanation suffers from both\nfactual and legal infirmities.\n\n     First, with regard to the assets transferred to the bridge\nbank, the window of time to “impact the position of Andorran\nauthorities” has closed. On July 14, 2016, after having\ntransferred the Bank’s assets to the Government-run bridge\ninstitution, the Andorran Government finalized the sale of the\nassets. Press Release, AREB, AREB Transfers Vall Banc to US\nInvestment Firm J.C. Flowers & Co. (July 14, 2016),\nhttp://areb.ad/images/areb/comunicats/14072016_AREB_EN\nG.pdf). Appellants do not dispute the facts proffered by\nAppellees to show that the Bank’s assets had been seized and\n\f                               18\nsold. See Br. for Appellees at 10–12. The record thus indicates\nthat the Bank’s assets have been out of the hands of the\nAndorran Government for nearly a year now, and Appellants\nfail to offer any path of events by which the Andorran\nGovernment could or would unwind the sale.\n\n     Second, Appellants may be correct that FinCEN’s Notices\n“indisputably prompted Andorra’s actions against [the Bank].”\nBr. of Appellants at 31. Even were that the case, however, it is\nfar from clear that a declaration that FinCEN violated the APA\nin promulgating the Notices would cause Andorra to reverse\ncourse. Appellants offer only conjecture, but no evidence,\nsuggesting that the Andorran Government would be influenced\nby such a declaration to undo the sale of Vall Banc to J.C.\nFlowers or to return any assets still held by the Government.\nAppellants are effectively asking this court to “accept\ninferences that are unsupported by the facts set out in the\ncomplaint.” Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 19 (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted). Appellants have offered no evidence\nthat the Andorran Government would reverse course as a result\nof the withdrawal of FinCEN’s Notices. And they have not\nshown that the sale actually could be undone even if the\nAndorran Government were so inclined.\n\n     Third, Appellants contend that, in rejecting their claim, the\nDistrict Court erred in “consider[ing] facts beyond the\npleadings.” Br. for Appellants at 34. Appellants appear to be\nreferring to the information about political developments in\nAndorra that took place after Appellants filed their complaint.\nIn any event, their contention is misguided. We have made it\nclear that, “[i]n determining standing, we may consider\nmaterials outside of the complaint.” Food & Water Watch, Inc.\nv. Vilsack, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 913 (D.C.

Indeed,\nAppellants apparently understand this because, during oral\nargument before this court, they asserted that the Andorran\n\f                               19\nGovernment still holds “1.5 billion euros” of the Bank’s assets.\nOral Arg. at 16:50-17:10. But the assertion was not supported\nby any evidence.\n\n     Finally, and most importantly, even as we view all of the\nrelevant facts in the light most favorable to Appellants, we find\nthat their arguments in support of redressability are much too\nspeculative to support standing. We are particularly disinclined\n“to endorse standing theories that rest on speculation about the\ndecisions of independent actors.” Clapper v.

In such cases,\nthe plaintiff must offer “substantial evidence of a causal\nrelationship between the government policy and the third-party\nconduct, leaving little doubt as to causation and the likelihood\nof redress.” Renal Physicians Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of Health &\nHuman Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186957\"><a href=\"/opinion/186957/renal-physn-assn-v-hhs/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1275 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (citation\nand internal quotation marks omitted). Appellants have offered\nno such evidence.\n\n     We have been particularly reluctant to find standing where\nthe third party upon whose conduct redressability depends is a\nforeign sovereign. See, e.g., Dellums v. U.S. Nuclear\nRegulatory Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515995\"><a href=\"/opinion/515995/congressman-ronald-v-dellums-v-us-nuclear-regulatory-commission-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">968</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 976 (D.C. Cir. 1988)\n(noting that “[o]ur own decisions . . . have declined to\nrecognize standing when the effectiveness of the relief\nrequested depends on the unforeseeable actions of a foreign\nnation”); Cardenas v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"435214\"><a href=\"/opinion/435214/amparo-cardenas-v-william-french-smith-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 914 (D.C. Cir.\n1984) (holding that plaintiff lacked standing because “the relief\n\f                               20\nin the present case could be obtained only through the consent\nof the Swiss government”).\n\n     As Appellants would have it, a judicial declaration that the\nNotices issued by FinCEN were unlawful would encourage the\nAndorran Government to unwind the seizure of the Bank’s\nassets and the subsequent sale of those assets to J.C. Flowers\nand to return any assets still held by the Government. Their\nclaim thus “depends on the unforeseeable actions” of the\nAndorran Government, which is not enough to support\nredressability. Dellums, 863 F.2d at 976. Appellants offer no\nevidence that the Andorran Government would respond as they\nsuggest. “When redress depends on the cooperation of a third\nparty, it becomes the burden of the [appellant] to adduce facts\nshowing that those choices have been or will be made in such\nmanner as to produce causation and permit redressability of\ninjury.” US Ecology, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n24–25 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Appellants have not met this burden.\n\n                     III.    CONCLUSION\n\n    For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the\njudgment of the District Court dismissing Appellants’\ncomplaint. We have no jurisdiction to hear their claims.\n\f</pre>",
