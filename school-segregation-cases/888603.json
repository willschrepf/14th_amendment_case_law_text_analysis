We hold that MCL\n\n 600.5821(4) exempts the state entities it lists from the one-year-back rule.            As a\n\fconsequence, we overrule Liptow v State Farm Mut Ins Co,1 which held to the contrary,\n\nand reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. We also overrule Cameron v Auto\n\nClub Ins Ass’n,2 on which the Liptow decision relied exclusively in reaching its\n\nconclusion.\n\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      Nicholas Morgan was severely injured in an automobile accident in March 2000.\n\nHe was treated at the University of Michigan Health System for six days. Less than one\n\nyear after the accident, Morgan sought personal protection insurance benefits through the\n\nMichigan Assigned Claims Facility (MACF). Because he was not covered under a no-\n\nfault insurance policy, the MACF designated Titan Insurance Company as the servicing\n\ninsurer for his claims. In January 2006, the University of Michigan Health System and\n\nthe university’s regents filed this lawsuit against Titan, seeking payment from defendant\n\nfor Morgan’s medical treatment. Plaintiffs sought reimbursement of the full cost of\n\nMorgan’s hospitalization, which they alleged was $69,957.19.\n\n      Defendant moved for summary disposition, arguing that the one-year-back rule of\n\nMCL 500.3145(1)3 barred plaintiffs from recovering the claimed damages. Plaintiffs\n\n\n\n      1\n          Liptow v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 272 Mich App 544; 726 NW2d 442\n(2006).\n      2\n          Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 476 Mich 55; 718 NW2d 784 (2006).\n      3\n        The one-year-back rule in MCL 500.3145(1) provides that “the claimant may not\nrecover benefits for any portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on\nwhich the action was commenced.”\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fcountered that MCL 600.5821(4)4 allows the state and its political subdivisions to file suit\n\nwithout limitation and entirely supersedes MCL 500.3145(1). They asserted that MCL\n\n600.5821(4) exempts certain suits brought by public entities from “the statute of\n\nlimitations” and allows initiation of such actions “at any time without limitation, the\n\nprovisions of any statute notwithstanding.” The trial court agreed with defendant and\n\ndismissed the suit.\n\n       On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed in a divided decision.5 The majority\n\nconcluded that, under MCR 7.215(J)(1), it was bound to follow the Liptow decision and\n\nuphold the trial court. Judge DAVIS agreed that Liptow was controlling, but opined that it\n\nhad been wrongly decided and that the Court should convene a conflict panel pursuant to\n\nMCR 7.215(J)(2) and (3). Initially, we denied leave to appeal,6 but on reconsideration,\n\nwe vacated the denial order, granted reconsideration, and granted leave to appeal.7\n\n       4\n           MCL 600.5821(4) provides:\n\n               Actions brought in the name of the state of Michigan, the people of\n       the state of Michigan, or any political subdivision of the state of Michigan,\n       or in the name of any officer or otherwise for the benefit of the state of\n       Michigan or any political subdivision of the state of Michigan for the\n       recovery of the cost of maintenance, care, and treatment of persons in\n       hospitals, homes, schools, and other state institutions are not subject to the\n       statute of limitations and may be brought at any time without limitation, the\n       provisions of any statute notwithstanding.\n       5\n         Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co, unpublished opinion per curiam of the\nCourt of Appeals, issued June 5, 2008 (Docket No. 276710).\n       6\n           Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co, 482 Mich 1074 (2008).\n       7\n         Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co, 484 Mich 852 (2009). Our order also\ndirected the parties to address whether Liptow and Cameron were correctly decided.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f              MCL 600.5851(1)—THE MINORITY/INSANITY PROVISION\n\n       An analysis of this Court’s rulings on the issues implicated in this case naturally\n\nbegins with Lambert v Calhoun.8 Lambert held that MCL 600.5851(1)9 preserves a claim\n\nby a minor or incompetent person even though the statute of limitations in the act under\n\nwhich the claim is brought bars the action.\n\n       Four years later, the Court of Appeals in Rawlins v Aetna Cas & Surety Co\n\nfollowed Lambert.10 It held that MCL 600.5851(1) preserves a no-fault claim by a minor\n\neven though it would otherwise be barred by the limitations period in the no-fault act.\n\n       Shortly after, in Geiger v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch,11 the Court of Appeals held\n\nthat MCL 600.5851(1) preserves a claim by a minor or incompetent person for personal\n\nprotection insurance benefits even though it would otherwise be barred by the one-year-\n\nback rule. Geiger remained the prevailing law in this state for the next 24 years.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n           Lambert v Calhoun, 394 Mich 179; 229 NW2d 332 (1975).\n       9\n           MCL 600.5851(1) states in part:\n\n              Except as otherwise provided in [MCL 600.5851(7) and (8)], if the\n       person first entitled to make an entry or bring an action under this act is\n       under 18 years of age or insane at the time the claim accrues, the person or\n       those claiming under the person shall have 1 year after the disability is\n       removed through death or otherwise, to make the entry or bring the action\n       although the period of limitations has run.\n       10\n            Rawlins v Aetna Cas & Surety Co, 92 Mich App 268; 284 NW2d 782 (1979).\n       11\n            Geiger v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch, 114 Mich App 283; 318 NW2d 833\n(1982).\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f                                CAMERON AND LIPTOW\n\n       In 2006, in Cameron, this Court overruled Geiger in a 4 to 3 decision. The\n\nmajority held that the minority/insanity provision in MCL 600.5851(1) did not remove\n\nthe plaintiff’s claim from application of the one-year-back rule. The analysis stated:\n\n               By its unambiguous terms, MCL 600.5851(1) concerns when a\n       minor or person suffering from insanity may “make the entry or bring the\n       action.” It does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an action has\n       been brought. MCL 600.5851(1) then is irrelevant to the damages-limiting\n       one-year-back provision of MCL 500.3145(1). Thus, to be clear, the\n       minority/insanity tolling provision in MCL 600.5851(1) does not operate to\n       toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1).[12]\n\nAccordingly, the majority held that a statute governing when a party may bring an action\n\ndoes not affect the damages recoverable under the one-year-back rule.\n\n       In Liptow, the Court of Appeals examined the interplay of the one-year-back rule\n\nand MCL 600.5821(4). Relying solely on Cameron, it stated:\n\n              Thus, the pertinent question is whether the damages-limiting portion\n       of MCL 500.3145(1), the one-year-back rule, limits the [claimant’s]\n       recovery. This Court’s ruling in Univ of Michigan Regents [v State Farm\n       Mut Ins Co, 250 Mich App 719, 733; 650 NW2d 129 (2002)] is of no\n       assistance in this determination. The issue appears to be one of first\n       impression.\n\n              MCL 600.5821(4) provides that actions brought by the state or its\n       subdivisions to recover the cost of maintenance, care, and treatment of\n       persons in state institutions “are not subject to the statute of limitations and\n       may be brought at any time without limitation, the provisions of any statute\n       notwithstanding.” We conclude that, by the plain import of this language,\n       the Legislature intended to exempt the state from statutes of limitations\n       when bringing an action to recover public funds. The language refers to\n       statutes of limitations and provides that an action may be brought at any\n\n       12\n            Cameron, 476 Mich at 62.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       time. But the statute does not address damage limitation provisions or any\n       other limiting provisions. In other words, like the minority tolling\n       provision, MCL 600.5821(4) concerns the time during which the state may\n       bring an action; it “does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an\n       action has been brought.” Cameron, supra, 476 Mich at 62. Accordingly,\n       we conclude that MCL 600.5821(4), like the minority tolling provision of\n       MCL 600.5851(1), does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule of MCL\n       500.3145(1). Cameron, supra, 476 Mich at 61-62. Therefore, we hold that\n       defendant is liable to the [claimant] only for costs it incurred for [the\n       patient’s] care, maintenance, and treatment in state institutions within one\n       year before the filing of the complaint.[13]\n\n                                         ANALYSIS\n\n       This case presents questions of statutory interpretation which are reviewed de\n\nnovo.14\n\n       No party disputes that MCL 600.5821(4) preserves plaintiffs’ right to bring the\n\ninstant cause of action. The question before us is whether MCL 500.3145(1) restricts\n\nplaintiffs’ recovery to damages incurred one year before plaintiffs filed suit. The answer\n\nturns on the correct understanding of the interaction between MCL 500.3145(1) and\n\nMCL 600.5821(4). It is undisputed that all of plaintiffs’ costs were incurred between\n\nMarch 18 and March 23, 2000. Thus, if the one-year-back rule applies to their claim,\n\nplaintiffs are entitled to no damages.\n\n       Defendant relies on Liptow, which held that the one-year-back rule governs\n\nactions to which MCL 600.5821(4) applies because the statute does not exempt state\n\nentities from its limitation on damages. We disagree.\n       13\n            Liptow, 272 Mich App at 555-556.\n       14\n            Dep’t of Agriculture v Appletree Mktg, LLC, 485 Mich 1, 7; 779 NW2d 237\n(2010).\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f       Defendant’s argument and the holding in Liptow rest on a fundamentally incorrect\n\npremise. Liptow reasoned that (1) MCL 600.5821(4) exempts state entities from any\n\nstatute of limitations, (2) the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1) is not a statute of\n\nlimitations, but a damages limitation, and therefore (3) MCL 600.5821(4) does not\n\nexempt a governmental entity from the one-year-back-rule of MCL 500.3145(1).15 This\n\npremise is derived from our decision in Cameron. Therefore, we are required to revisit\n\nCameron’s analysis.\n\n       The Cameron majority concluded that actions brought pursuant to MCL\n\n600.5851(1) are subject to the one-year-back rule because that statute does not implicate\n\nwhen a plaintiff may “bring an action.” We conclude that the statutory language in MCL\n\n600.5851(1) and MCL 500.3145(1) does not command the conclusion that the Cameron\n\nmajority reached.\n\n       To begin with, we conclude that the approach in Cameron was flawed because it\n\nread the statutory language in isolation. MCL 600.5851(1) does not create its own\n\nindependent cause of action. It must be read together with the statute under which the\n\nplaintiff seeks to recover. In no-fault cases, for example, MCL 600.5851(1) must be read\n\ntogether with MCL 500.3145(1). Doing so, the statutes grant infants and incompetent\n\npersons one year after their disability is removed to “bring the action” “for recovery of\n\npersonal protection insurance benefits . . . for accidental bodily injury . . . .” On the basis\n\n\n\n       15\n            See Cameron, 476 Mich at 62.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fof its language, MCL 600.5851(1) supersedes all limitations in MCL 500.3145(1),\n\nincluding the one-year-back rule’s limitation on the period of recovery.16\n\n       For what purpose might a plaintiff “bring an action”? Surely not for the sole\n\nsatisfaction of filing papers in court. A plaintiff brings a tort action to recover damages.\n\nAlthough the right to bring an action would be a hollow one indeed if a plaintiff could not\n\nrecover damages, Cameron and Liptow limited a plaintiff to just that hollow right.\n\nTherefore, we restore the proper understanding of the interaction between MCL\n\n600.5851(1) and the one-year-back rule.          We hold that the “action” and “claim”\n\npreserved by MCL 600.5851(1) include the right to collect damages.              As Justice\n\nCAVANAGH explained in his dissenting opinion in Cameron,\n\n       [t]he word “claim” has been discussed by this Court many times over the\n       past century. For instance, in Allen v Bd of State Auditors, 122 Mich 324;\n       81 NW 113 (1899), this Court noted the following definition of the word\n       “claim”: “‘[A] demand of a right or alleged right; a calling on another for\n       something due or asserted to be due; as, a claim of wages for services.’” Id.\n       at 328, citing Cent Dict. In In re Chamberlain’s Estate, 298 Mich 278; 299\n       NW 82 (1941), this Court explained that “‘[t]he word “claims” is “by\n       authorities generally construed as referring to demands of a pecuniary\n       nature and which could have been enforced against the deceased in his\n       lifetime.”’” Id. at 285, quoting In re Quinney’s Estate, 287 Mich 329, 333;\n       283 NW 599 (1939), quoting Knutsen v Krook, 111 Minn 352, 357; 127\n       NW 11 (1910). More recently, in CAM Constr v Lake Edgewood Condo\n       Ass’n, 465 Mich 549, 554-555; 640 NW2d 256 (2002), this Court set forth\n       the legal definitions of the term:\n\n             “1. The aggregate of operative facts giving rise to a right enforceable\n       by a court . . . . 2. The assertion of an existing right; any right to payment\n\n       16\n          Therefore, we also do not agree with Justice MARKMAN’s criticism that we\n“discern the purpose of the statute from something other than its actual language . . . .”\nPost at ___.\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f         or to an equitable remedy, even if contingent or provisional . . . . 3. A\n         demand for money or property to which one asserts a right . . . . [Black’s\n         Law Dictionary (7th ed).]”\n\n                 In short, then, a claim means a “demand[] of a pecuniary nature,” a\n         “right to payment,” and a “demand for money.”[17]\n\n         Justice CAVANAGH’s dissent is equally applicable here. The statute at issue in this\n\ncase, MCL 600.5821(4), also addresses “[a]ctions.” Specifically, it preserves actions\n\nbrought by state entities. It also explicitly delineates that the action contemplated is one\n\nbrought for the recovery for certain costs incurred. MCL 600.5821(4) lists the costs as\n\nthose for the “maintenance, care, and treatment of persons in hospitals, homes, schools,\n\nand other state institutions . . . .” Thus, it is apparent from the language of the statute that\n\nthe Legislature intended to preserve more than the state entities’ right to file papers in\n\ncourt.\n\n         Moreover, this Court’s caselaw predating Cameron also does not support the\n\nCameron majority’s holding. The only authority cited for Cameron’s interpretation was\n\nin Justice MARKMAN’s concurring opinion, which relied on dicta from Justice\n\nBRICKLEY’s lead opinion in Howard v Gen Motors Corp.18\n\n\n         17\n              Cameron, 476 Mich at 100 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).\n         18\n        Howard v Gen Motors Corp, 427 Mich 358; 399 NW2d 10 (1986). Only Justice\nRILEY concurred in Justice BRICKLEY’s opinion.\n\n        We take no issue with Justice MARKMAN’s argument that the Cameron majority\nneeded no “authority” to support its holding other than “the language of the statute\nitself.” Post at ___. But he wrongly claims that this opinion “fails to apprehend” the\nprinciple of statutory interpretation that the actual language of the statutes is the best\nindicator of legislative intent. Post at ___. To the contrary, we conclude that the\n\n\n                                               9\n\f       In Howard, two justices analyzed the one-year-back rule in the workers’\n\ncompensation act to determine whether it was a jurisdictional affirmative defense akin to\n\na statute of limitations. Justice BRICKLEY concluded that “the ‘statute of limitations’\n\ninterpretation of the one-year-back rule offered in Kleinschrodt[19] and applied to the two-\n\nyear-back rule in Kingery[20] and Howard [in the Court of Appeals] contradicts our earlier\n\nprecedent on the subject as well as the plain language of the statutes.”21 By contrast, in\n\nKleinschrodt, five justices stated that “[w]e are of the opinion that the one-year-back\n\nprovision is a defense, akin to the statute of limitations . . . .”22\n\n       In sum, for more than 20 years before Cameron, the majority in all of the Court’s\n\nrelevant opinions saw no basis for treating any of the provisions of MCL 500.3145(1)\n\ndifferently. In Welton v Carriers Ins Co, we made a distinction among the provisions\n\nonly to the extent of noting that the section contains “two limitations on time of suit and\n\none limitation on period of recovery[.]”23 Even then, the Welton Court saw no basis for\n\n\n\n\nstatutory language does not compel the interpretation reached by the Cameron majority.\nSee pages 7-10 of this opinion. We make the additional observation that our caselaw also\nprovides no support for the Cameron majority’s interpretation.\n       19\n            Kleinschrodt v Gen Motors Corp, 402 Mich 381, 384; 263 NW2d 246 (1978).\n       20\n            Kingery v Ford Motor Co, 116 Mich App 606; 323 NW2d 318 (1982).\n       21\n            Howard, 427 Mich at 383.\n       22\n            Kleinschrodt, 402 Mich at 384.\n       23\n            Welton v Carriers Ins Co, 421 Mich 571, 576; 365 NW2d 170 (1984).\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\ftreating the provisions differently.24   Indeed, the law was so well settled that the\n\ndefendants in Cameron did not even argue for different treatment until this Court heard\n\noral argument on appeal.25\n\n      Thus, we conclude that Cameron erroneously held that MCL 600.5851(1) does not\n\nprotect a plaintiff’s claim from the one-year-back rule.         We also hold that this\n\nunderstanding of the interaction between the statutes is equally applicable to the\n\ninteraction between MCL 600.5821(4) and MCL 500.3145(1). Therefore, the provisions\n\nof MCL 600.5821(4) preserving a plaintiff’s right to bring an action also preserve the\n\nplaintiff’s right to recover damages incurred more than one year before suit is filed. The\n\none-year-back rule in MCL 500.3145(1) is inapplicable to such claims.26\n\n\n\n\n      24\n         Id. at 577 n 2 (“Applying the tolling to both the limitation period and the period\nof recovery accords with common sense, since the only reason for tolling the limitation\nprovision to get plaintiff into court is to allow recovery for that earlier expense.”).\n      25\n          Cameron, 476 Mich at 89 n 4 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). As Justice\nCAVANAGH observed, defense counsel in Cameron did not even divine this argument, but\nadopted it only after this Court raised the question sua sponte.\n      26\n         In reaching our decision today, we do not rely on plaintiffs’ argument that\nLiptow was inconsistent with the Court of Appeals’ decision in Univ of Mich Regents v\nState Farm Mut Ins Co, 250 Mich App 719; 650 NW2d 129 (2002). Thus, we need not\naddress Justice MARKMAN’s rejection of this argument.\n\n       We also decline to comment on Justice MARKMAN’s discussion of the “absurd\nresult” doctrine, because we do not rely on it to reach our decision here.\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f                                    STARE DECISIS27\n\n       For the aforementioned reasons, we conclude that Cameron was wrongly decided.\n\nHowever, despite the fact that a previous decision was wrongly decided, we must be\n\nmindful of the doctrine of stare decisis when deciding whether to overrule it.28 Our\n\nanalysis always begins with a presumption that upholding precedent is the preferred\n\n       27\n         I recognize that there are different approaches used by members of the Court in\napplying the doctrine of stare decisis. See, e.g., post at __ (WEAVER, J., concurring); post\nat __ (HATHAWAY, J., concurring); Robinson v Detroit, 462 Mich 439, 464; 613 NW2d\n307 (2000).\n\n        I believe that our thoughtful and lengthy treatments of whether Cameron is\nentitled to stare decisis respect belie Justice YOUNG’s criticism that “today precedent is\nno longer an ‘issue.’” Post at ___. Justice YOUNG disdains our positions of the last\ndecade regarding stare decisis as nothing but a “decade-long shrill pretense . . . .” Post at\n___. But he is incorrect. Not only have our positions been put forth without vitriol and\nad hominem innuendos, there has been no pretense about them.\n\n       Nor do we simply ignore precedent with which we disagree, as Justice YOUNG\nonce again asserts. It appears that he intends to repeat himself using an identical attack in\neach and every case in which I vote for a different result than he does. See, e.g.,\nEsselman v Garden City Hosp, 486 Mich 892 (2010). But with each repetition, his\nclaims grow less believable.\n\n       Finally, Justice YOUNG again quotes a statement I made two years ago and applies\nit in an altogether different context to impugn my motives for voting as I have in this\ncase. But he has no wisdom concerning my motives, nor do I claim any concerning his.\nHis attack has no proper place in a judicial opinion.\n       28\n          We are at a loss to understand Justice MARKMAN’s argument that we deem it\n“appropriate” to overrule Cameron because Cameron overruled Geiger. Post at ___,\n___. To be clear, we conclude that it is appropriate to overrule Cameron because it was\nwrongly decided and stare decisis considerations do not support retaining it. Thus,\nweighing the merits of overruling Cameron vis-à-vis overruling Geiger, an analysis that\nhis dissent engages in, post at ___, is not necessary to our analysis. He also claims that\nour decision to overrule Cameron makes the caselaw of our state less consistent with the\nintentions of the Legislature. Post at ___. In most disputes that come before this Court,\nincluding this one, the validity of such a claim is undoubtedly in the eye of the beholder.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fcourse of action.29 That presumption should be retained until effectively rebutted by the\n\nconclusion that a compelling justification exists to overturn it.30 Nonetheless, when\n\nanalyzing precedent that itself represents a recent departure from established caselaw, we\n\napply a decreased presumption in favor of upholding precedent.31\n\n       In determining whether a compelling justification exists to overturn precedent, the\n\nCourt may consider numerous evaluative criteria, none of which, standing alone, is\n\ndispositive. Historically, courts have considered (1) whether the precedent has proved to\n\nbe intolerable because it defies practical workability, (2) whether reliance on it is such\n\nthat overruling it would cause a special hardship and inequity, (3) whether related\n\nprinciples of law have so far developed since the precedent was pronounced that no more\n\nthan a remnant of it has survived, (4) whether facts and circumstances have so changed,\n\nor come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the precedent of significant\n\napplication or justification, (5) whether other jurisdictions have decided similar issues in\n\na different manner, (6) whether upholding the precedent is likely to result in serious\n\ndetriment prejudicial to public interests, and (7) whether the prior decision was an abrupt\n\nand largely unexplained departure from then existing precedent.\n\n\n\n\n       29\n        Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 317; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (opinion by\nKELLY, C.J.).\n       30\n            Id.\n       31\n        Adarand Constructors, Inc v Pena, 515 US 200, 233-234; 115 S Ct 2097; 132 L\nEd 2d 158 (1995).\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f         These factors may or may not be applicable in a given case. Nor is there a magic\n\nnumber of factors that must favor overruling a case in order to establish the requisite\n\ncompelling justification. Rather, this conclusion should be reached on a case-by-case\n\nbasis.\n\n         Here, we first consider whether Cameron has proved intolerable because it defies\n\npractical workability. Indeed it does. Cameron left MCL 600.5851(1) and similar\n\nprovisions void of effect in many cases while ostensibly protecting an injured party’s\n\nright to file suit. This created an indefensible paradox and, as such, an unworkable and\n\nconfusing legal landscape. Consider, for example, the hypothetical case of a boy injured\n\nin a car accident at age 12 and fully recovered by age 15. Upon reaching 18, he retains\n\nan attorney to file suit to recover the costs associated with the treatment of his injuries,\n\nrelying on MCL 600.5851(1). The defendant also retains counsel, who responds by filing\n\na motion to dismiss, arguing that none of the plaintiff’s damages are recoverable. The\n\ntrial court parses the parties’ filings and determines that none of the plaintiff’s costs were\n\nincurred in the year before suit was filed.\n\n         Under Cameron, the plaintiff in this hypothetical case was indisputably entitled to\n\nfile suit, because MCL 600.5851(1) preserved his right to do so. Yet Cameron gutted his\n\nsuit of any practical worth because, under its interpretation of MCL 600.5851(1), the\n\nplaintiff had no chance to recover any damages. Thus, the plaintiff was denied the legal\n\nrecourse the Legislature provided him, which is, after reaching his majority, to recover\n\nthe damages he incurred more than a year earlier.          Accordingly, we conclude that\n\nCameron is frequently innately unworkable.\n\n\n                                              14\n\f       Second, we consider whether reliance interests weigh in favor of overruling\n\nCameron. We conclude that they do. Cameron is of recent vintage, having been decided\n\na mere four years ago. Hence, reliance on its holding has been of limited duration.\n\nMoreover, Cameron represented a sea change in one area of the law and toppled settled\n\ninterpretations of the no-fault act that had existed almost since the adoption of MCL\n\n600.5851.32 In doing so, Cameron disrupted the reliance interests of the injured minors\n\nand the incompetents who relied on its provisions to preserve their claims until removal\n\nof their disabilities.\n\n       We recognize that there exists a competing reliance interest in the continuing\n\nvalidity of Cameron: that of the defendants in no-fault cases.              Yet Cameron’s\n\nevisceration of the crux of a plaintiff’s claim—the potential to recover damages—\n\neffectively removed altogether the incentive to file suit as permitted by MCL\n\n600.5851(1). We conclude that, while no-fault defendants’ reliance on this interpretation\n\nis reasonable, it is not itself sufficient to preclude overruling Cameron given the extent of\n\nCameron’s prejudice to no-fault plaintiffs.\n\n       Third, we consider whether related principles of law have developed since\n\nCameron’s interpretation of MCL 600.5851(1) was pronounced.                  This factor is\n\ninapplicable to our stare decisis analysis in this case, as we are aware of no intervening\n\nchange in the law that further supports or undermines Cameron’s continuing legitimacy.\n\n\n\n       32\n            See n 35 of this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f       Fourth, we examine whether facts and circumstances have so changed, or have\n\ncome to be seen so differently, that Cameron has been robbed of significant justification.\n\nLike the previous factor, we discern no factual or circumstantial changes that counsel for\n\nor against overruling Cameron. Therefore, this factor also is inapplicable to our analysis.\n\n       Fifth, we consider whether other jurisdictions have decided similar issues in a\n\ndifferent manner.        This factor is likewise inapplicable to our stare decisis analysis.\n\nMichigan’s comprehensive no-fault insurance scheme is unique to our state. While other\n\nstates share the fundamental underpinnings of our system, judicial interpretations of the\n\nno-fault act have evolved independently of those of other states with similar insurance\n\nschemes. Thus, other jurisdictions’ interpretations of similar statutes are unhelpful to our\n\nanalysis in this case.\n\n       Sixth, we examine whether upholding Cameron is likely to result in serious\n\ndetriment prejudicial to public interests. We conclude that this factor weighs heavily in\n\nfavor of overruling Cameron. Cameron drastically curtailed the protection provided by\n\nthe Legislature for minors and incompetents.           In enacting MCL 600.5851(1), the\n\nLegislature conveyed its intention to protect individuals in those groups with unique\n\ntreatment under the law. The statute represents the culmination of the Legislature’s\n\ndeliberative process. Cameron undermined the Legislature’s decision to provide a “year\n\nof grace” to infants and incompetents in recognition of their inability to legally act until\n\ntheir disabilities are removed.33\n\n       33\n            See Cameron, 476 Mich at 97 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f       Moreover, Cameron set an ironic trap for minors and incompetents. As Justice\n\nCAVANAGH astutely noted in dissent:\n\n              [I]f a person is injured in a motor vehicle accident while an infant or\n       legally incompetent, and his injuries resolve a year or more before his\n       disability resolves, then [Cameron’s] interpretation of MCL 500.3145(1)\n       will completely preclude that person from recovering any of the damages\n       incurred from the accident, and, thus completely abrogate his claim.[34]\n\nThus, what the Legislature intended as a provision to preserve a plaintiff’s claims,\n\nCameron rendered largely meaningless.             In certain circumstances, Cameron’s\n\ninterpretation of the saving provision actually operates to extinguish a claim, not save it.\n\n       Finally, we consider whether Cameron represented an abrupt and largely\n\nunexplained departure from precedent. We conclude that this factor also weighs heavily\n\nin favor of overruling Cameron. Cameron overruled Geiger,35 a Court of Appeals case\n\ninterpreting the interplay between the saving provision and the no-fault act. Geiger was\n\n\n\n\n        Moreover, Justice MARKMAN is certainly correct that there is a general public\ninterest in keeping no-fault insurance affordable. However, preserving claims brought by\na group specifically protected by the Legislature—minors, incompetents, or state\nentities—is particularly compelling, given that the Legislature singled out these groups\nfor disparate treatment.\n       34\n            Id. at 93 n 6.\n       35\n         Geiger cited Rawlins for the proposition that MCL 600.5851 applied to the one-\nyear period of limitations in MCL 500.3145(1). Thus, the underlying analytical support\nfor Geiger dates back 27 years.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fdecided in 1982 and stood as the seminal interpretation of the one-year-back rule until\n\nCameron unexpectedly swept it aside 24 years later.36\n\n       Furthermore, as noted, a majority of this Court had concluded before Cameron\n\nthat the one-year-back rule does not apply to claims preserved by tolling. We made this\n\ndecision even though in Welton we described the provisions of MCL 500.3145(1) as “two\n\nlimitations on time of suit and one limitation on period of recovery[.]”37 To the extent\n\nthat Cameron held otherwise, it also implicitly overruled Welton. Thus, we are firmly\n\nconvinced that Cameron represented an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from\n\nprecedent.\n\n       In summary, Cameron is often unworkable, has not engendered valid reliance\n\ninterests, has caused serious detriment prejudicial to public interests, and represented an\n\nabrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent. Accordingly, we conclude that\n\na compelling justification exists for overruling it.38\n\n\n\n\n       36\n          Given that our decision does nothing more than restore the law to its pre-2006\nstate, we find defendant’s assertion that overruling Cameron will have “devastating\neffects” highly questionable.\n       37\n            Welton, 421 Mich at 576.\n       38\n         Justice MARKMAN is correct that a majority of this Court has overruled several\nprecedents this term. But it is an overstatement for his dissent to characterize this as a\nmass or flood of overrulings. Post at ___. This is particularly true given that almost\nevery case overruled this term is one in which the former majority departed from settled\njurisprudence to establish a new rule of law.\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\f                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       We overrule our decision in Cameron and the Court of Appeals’ decision in\n\nLiptow. Entities listed in MCL 600.5821(4) may bring an action and recover costs\n\nnotwithstanding the limiting provisions of MCL 500.3145(1), including the one-year-\n\nback rule. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case and\n\nremand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n       CAVANAGH, WEAVER (except for the part entitled “Stare Decisis”), and\n\nHATHAWAY, JJ., concurred with KELLY, C.J.\n\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f                              STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                     SUPREME COURT\n\n\nREGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN and UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN HEALTH SYSTEM,\n\n                Plaintiffs-Appellants,\n\nv                                                           No. 136905\n\nTITAN INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n                Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\nWEAVER, J. (concurring).\n\n       I concur in and sign all of the majority opinion except the section entitled “Stare\n\nDecisis.” I write separately to note that in addition to the reasons given in the majority\n\nopinion, I also believe that Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 476 Mich 55; 718 NW2d 784\n\n(2006), should be overruled for the reasons in my dissent to the Cameron decision. Id. at\n\n104.\n\n       In Cameron, the majority failed to give proper effect to the language contained in\n\nMCL 500.3145(1).1 As I noted in my Cameron dissent, the “one-year-back rule” is not a\n\n\n       1\n           MCL 500.3145(1) states:\n\n              An action for recovery of personal protection insurance benefits\n       payable under this chapter for accidental bodily injury may not be\n       commenced later than 1 year after the date of the accident causing the\n       injury unless written notice of injury as provided herein has been given to\n       the insurer within 1 year after the accident or unless the insurer has\n\fperiod of limitations as interpreted by the majority. Id. at 106. Rather, the “one-year-\n\nback rule” is part of the statute that details how to apply the tolling provision contained in\n\nthe period of limitations laid out in the first sentence of MCL 500.3145(1). Id. at 106-\n\n107. By holding that the one-year-back rule was a period of limitations, the Cameron\n\nmajority failed to “give meaning to the actual text of the statute.” Id. at 108.\n\n       In addition to the lack of restraint of the Cameron majority’s use of the judicial\n\npower of interpretation, Chief Justice KELLY’s majority opinion in this case shows that\n\nthe Cameron majority failed to exercise common sense and fairness. As noted in Chief\n\nJustice KELLY’s majority opinion in this case, Cameron resulted in the Legislature’s\n\nsavings provisions regarding minors and government entities becoming hollow rights\n\nwhen injuries occurred more than a year before a lawsuit was filed.\n\n       On the subject of stare decisis, Justice YOUNG’s dissent in this case attempts to\n\ndeceive the public. It attempts to lump together the four justices who agree with parts of\n\nthe majority opinion into having had some sort of previously stated fidelity to stare\n\ndecisis that those justices have abandoned since former Chief Justice TAYLOR’s\n\noverwhelming defeat in the 2008 election.\n\n\n\n\n       previously made a payment of personal protection insurance benefits for the\n       injury. If the notice has been given or a payment has been made, the action\n       may be commenced at any time within 1 year after the most recent\n       allowable expense, work loss or survivor's loss has been incurred.\n       However, the claimant may not recover benefits for any portion of the loss\n       incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was\n       commenced.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       Justice YOUNG’s dissent quotes various past statements, made by those justices\n\nsigning portions of the majority opinion, regarding stare decisis and criticizing the former\n\n“majority of four” (former Chief Justice TAYLOR and Justices CORRIGAN, YOUNG, and\n\nMARKMAN). With respect to myself, the dissent quotes a statement I made in response to\n\nthe improper and unfair dismantling of decades of longstanding insurance contract law by\n\nthe former “majority of four” in Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 473 Mich 562; 702\n\nNW2d 539 (2005). In Devillers, I stated, “Correction for correction’s sake does not make\n\nsense. The case has not been made why the Court should not adhere to the doctrine of\n\nstare decisis in this case.” Id. at 622 (WEAVER, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).\n\n       Justice YOUNG’s dissent uses my Devillers statement in what appears to be an\n\nattempt to try to get people to believe that I have somehow changed my view of stare\n\ndecisis since former Chief Justice TAYLOR was defeated.          The dissent’s misleading\n\nassertions are simply incorrect.\n\n       My Devillers statement itself shows that I was criticizing the disregard for stare\n\ndecisis in that specific case. My Devillers statement is an example of my service to the\n\nrule of law and a partial expression of my view of the policy of stare decisis, which is that\n\npast precedent should generally be followed but that, in deciding whether wrongly\n\ndecided precedent should be overruled, each case should be looked at individually on its\n\nfacts and merits through the lens of judicial restraint, common sense, and fairness.\n\n       Justice YOUNG’s dissent cannot point to a statement where I professed some sort\n\nof position regarding stare decisis as an immutable doctrine because I have not taken that\n\nposition and therefore have made no such statements. Justice YOUNG’s various dissents\n\n\n                                             3\n\fcontinue to mischaracterize my positions by making inaccurate statements, using partial\n\nquotes taken out of context, and omitting relevant information in an apparent attempt to\n\ndeceive readers.2\n\n       I agree with the sentiment recently expressed by Chief Justice Roberts of the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court in his concurrence to the decision in Citizens United v Fed\n\nElection Comm, 558 US ___, ___; 130 S Ct 876, 920; 175 L Ed 2d 753, 806 (2010),\n\nwhen he said that\n\n       stare decisis is neither an “inexorable command,” Lawrence v. Texas, 539\n       U. S. 558, 577 [123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508] (2003), nor “a mechanical\n       formula of adherence to the latest decision,” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.\n       S. 106, 119 [60 S Ct 444; 84 L Ed 604] (1940) . . . . If it were, segregation\n       would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the\n       Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first\n       obtaining warrants.

I chose not to sign Chief Justice KELLY’s lead opinion in Petersen v\n\nMagna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 316-320; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), because it proposed to\n\ncreate a standardized test for stare decisis. Likewise, I do not sign the majority opinion’s\n\nstare decisis section in this case because it applies Petersen. There is no need for this\n\nCourt to adopt any standardized test regarding stare decisis. In fact, it is an impossible\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         It appears that Justice YOUNG does not agree with Chief Justice Roberts. In\nJustice YOUNG’s dissent, he lists 12 cases that have been overruled by this Court in the\npast 18 months. While Justice YOUNG may feel aggrieved by this Court overruling those\n12 cases, amongst those cases were some of the most egregious examples of judicial\nactivism that did great harm to the people of Michigan. Those decisions were made by\nthe “majority of four,” including Justice YOUNG, under the guise of ideologies such as\n“textualism” and “judicial traditionalism.” Justice YOUNG’s apparent contempt for the\ncommon law and common sense can be seen in his 2004 article in the Texas Review of\nLaw and Politics, where Justice YOUNG stated:\n\n             Consequently, I want to focus my remarks here on the\n       embarrassment that the common law presents—or ought to present—to a\n       conscientious judicial traditionalist. . . .\n\n              To give a graphic illustration of my feelings on the subject, I tend to\n       think of the common law as a drunken, toothless ancient relative, sprawled\n       prominently and in a state of nature on a settee in the middle of one’s\n       genteel garden party. Grandpa’s presence is undoubtedly a cause of\n       mortification to the host. But since only the most ill-bred of guests would\n       be coarse enough to comment on Grandpa’s presence and condition, all\n       concerned simply try ignore him. [Young, A judicial traditionalist\n       confronts the common law, 8 Texas Rev L & Pol 299, 301-302 (2004).]\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\ftask. There are many factors to consider when deciding whether or not to overrule\n\nprecedent, and the importance of such factors often changes on a case-by-case basis.4\n\n       In the end, the consideration of stare decisis and whether to overrule wrongly\n\ndecided precedent always includes service to the rule of law through an application and\n\nexercise of judicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness—justice for all.\n\n       In serving the rule of law and applying judicial restraint, common sense, and a\n\nsense of fairness to the case at hand, I agree with and join the majority opinion’s holding\n\nthat Cameron is overruled.\n\n\n                                                        Elizabeth A. Weaver\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          Over the past decade, the principal tool used by this Court to decide when a\nprecedent should be overruled is the set of guidelines that was laid out in Robinson v\nDetroit, 462 Mich 439, 463; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), an opinion written by former Justice\nTAYLOR that Justices CORRIGAN, YOUNG, MARKMAN, and I signed, and that I have used\nnumerous times. By no means do I consider the Robinson guidelines a “be-all, end-all\ntest” that constitutes precedent of this Court to be used whenever this Court considers\noverruling precedent. I view Robinson as merely providing guidelines to assist this Court\nin its legal analysis when pertinent. I note that my position in Devillers is in no way\ninconsistent with my position on stare decisis in this case, nor is it inconsistent with any\nposition on stare decisis that I have taken in other cases, such as Robinson. Devillers\ninvolved the “majority of four” overruling precedent involving contract interpretation\nfrom a case that was nearly twenty (20) years old. In my Devillers dissent, I noted that I\nagreed with the majority’s interpretation that the old precedent was incorrect, but given\nthe passage of time since that specific precedent was decided, the Court should not\ndisturb that longstanding precedent because the law had become so ingrained that to\noverrule it would harm the reliance interests of parties in insurance cases. My position in\nDevillers was entirely consistent with the reliance prong of the Robinson guidelines. My\nposition in the instant case is also consistent with the reliance prong of the Robinson\nguidelines since Cameron, the case which is now being overruled, was only decided four\n(4) years ago.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f                               STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                      SUPREME COURT\n\n\nREGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN and UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN HEALTH SYSTEM,\n\n                 Plaintiffs-Appellants,\n\nv                                                         No. 136905\n\nTITAN INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n                 Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\nHATHAWAY, J. (concurring).\n\n       I fully concur with Chief Justice KELLY’s analysis and conclusion in this matter\n\nand support overruling Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 476 Mich 55; 718 NW2d 784\n\n(2006).    I also fully concur with Justice WEAVER’s stare decisis analysis in her\n\nconcurring opinion. I write separately to express my own thoughts on the doctrine of\n\nstare decisis.\n\n       Given the debate amongst the justices of this Court concerning what constitutes\n\nthe proper stare decisis analysis, I find it insightful to review how our United States\n\nSupreme Court has treated the doctrine.     Stare decisis is a principle of policy that\n\ncommands judicial respect for a court’s earlier decisions and the rules of law that they\n\nembody. See Harris v United States, 536 US 545, 556-557; 122 S Ct 2406; 153 L Ed 2d\n\n524 (2002); Helvering v Hallock, 309 US 106, 119; 60 S Ct 444; 84 L Ed 604 (1940).\n\n“Stare decisis is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable,\n\fand consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and\n\ncontributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.”          Payne v\n\nTennessee, 501 US 808, 827; 111 S Ct 2597; 115 L Ed 2d 720 (1991). However, when\n\nbalancing the need to depart from precedent with the need to adhere to established\n\nprecedent, it is important to bear in mind that stare decisis is neither an “inexorable\n\ncommand,” Lawrence v Texas, 539 US 558, 577; 123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508\n\n(2003), nor “a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision,” Helvering, 309\n\nUS at 119. “If it were, segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be\n\nunconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without\n\nfirst obtaining warrants. See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 [16 S Ct 1138; 41 L Ed\n\n256] (1896), overruled by Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 [74 S Ct 686; 98\n\nL Ed 873] (1954); Adkins v. Children’s Hospital of D. C., 261 U. S. 525 [43 S Ct 394; 67\n\nL Ed 785] (1923), overruled by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parish, 300 U. S. 379 [57 S Ct\n\n578; 81 L Ed 703] (1937); Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 [48 S Ct 564; 72 L\n\nEd 944] (1928), overruled by Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 [88 S Ct 507; 19 L Ed\n\n2d 576] (1967).” Citizens United v Fed Election Comm, 558 US __, __; 130 S Ct 876,\n\n920; 175 L Ed 2d 753, 806 (2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring).\n\n       I too believe that stare decisis is a principle of policy. As stated in Helvering:\n\n              We recognize that stare decisis embodies an important social policy.\n       It represents an element of continuity in law, and is rooted in the\n       psychologic need to satisfy reasonable expectations. But stare decisis is a\n       principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest\n       decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f      collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically\n      sounder, and verified by experience.[1]\n\n      I do not agree with any approach to stare decisis that suggests or implies that it is a\n\n“rule” or “law” subject to a particularized test to be used in all circumstances. Any\n\nparticular approach to stare decisis, such as the one taken in Robinson v Detroit, 462\n\nMich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), is not “law” or “established precedent” that would\n\nrequire us to overrule, reject or modify its analysis. The Robinson approach to stare\n\ndecisis, just as the one taken in Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300; 773 NW2d 564\n\n(2009), is one among many varying approaches, and no particular approach, in and of\n\nitself, is inherently superior to another. As with any policy determination, the approach\n\ntaken in any given case will depend on the facts and circumstances presented.\n\n      Historically, the United States Supreme Court has utilized many different\n\napproaches to stare decisis, including such approaches as those involving a “compelling\n\njustification,”2 “special justification,”3 and a determination that a case was “wrongly\n\ndecided.”4 Each of these approaches is valid and offers a different nuance to stare decisis\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Helvering, 309 US at 119.\n      2\n        14 Penn Plaza LLC v Pyett, 556 US ___, ___; 129 S Ct 1456, 1478; 173 L Ed 2d\n398, 425 (2009).\n      3\n          Arizona v Rumsey, 467 US 203, 212; 104 S Ct 2305; 81 L Ed 2d 164 (1984).\n      4\n         Seminole Tribe of Florida v Florida, 517 US 44, 66; 116 S Ct 1114; 134 L Ed\n2d 252 (1996).\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fconsideration.5 However, because stare decisis is a policy consideration, which must be\n\nconsidered on a case-by-case basis, the particular analytical approach will differ from\n\ncase to case. Most importantly, the critical analysis should be on the rationale regarding\n\nwhether or not to change precedent.\n\n       It is also worthy to note that not only has the United States Supreme Court\n\nhistorically not taken one single approach to the application of stare decisis, the Court has\n\nnot felt compelled to discuss stare decisis in all cases when precedent is being overturned.\n\nMany landmark cases that overruled well-established precedent did not discuss or even\n\nmention the phrase “stare decisis.” For example, Brown overruled Plessy, thereby ending\n\nsegregation in our public schools, without mentioning the phrase “stare decisis,” much\n\nless articulating and following a particularized test. Similarly, Gideon v Wainwright, 372\n\nUS 335; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963), which established the rights of indigents to\n\nhave counsel in all criminal cases, not merely capital offenses, overruled Betts v Brady,\n\n316 US 455; 62 S Ct 1252; 86 L Ed 1595 (1942), again without mentioning “stare\n\ndecisis” or a particularized test. Instead, both of these cases focused on the important\n\npolicy considerations that weighed in favor of overruling precedent.6\n\n\n\n       5\n        Any of these approaches to stare decisis can be valid depending on the issues\nbefore the court. However, the factors used in any of these tests may or may not be\napplicable in any given case.\n       6\n         See Supreme Court Decisions Overruled By Subsequent Decisions, available at\n<http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/048.pdf> (accessed July 28, 2010), for\na partial list of United States Supreme Court cases (covering the period from 1810 to\n2001) that overrule precedent. Numerous additional examples can be found on this list of\n\n\n                                             4\n\f      With these principles in mind, any analysis of the impact of stare decisis must\n\nfocus on the individual case and the reason for overruling precedent. Thus, the reasons\n\nfor overruling Cameron are paramount to any articulated test and the special and\n\ncompelling justifications to do so are overwhelming in this case. As I agree with the\n\nwell-articulated reasons expressed by Chief Justice KELLY, I will not repeat them here.\n\n\n                                                       Diane M.

(concurring).\n\n      I authored the majority opinion in this case and therefore join it in its entirety. I\n\nwrite separately because Justices YOUNG and CORRIGAN continue to misleadingly refer\n\nto a statement I made off the bench nearly two years ago that was published by the\n\nDetroit Free Press.1 They seem to believe that this statement provides them insight into\n\nmy motivation for voting as I have in every subsequent case that has come before the\n\n\n      1\n         Post at ___. Justice YOUNG has cited my statement on numerous occasions,\nimpugning my motives for voting as I did on each occasion. See, e.g., O’Neal v St John\nHosp & Med Ctr, ___ Mich ___, ___; ___ NW2d ___ (2010) (YOUNG, J., dissenting);\nPollard v Suburban Mobility Auth for Regional Transp, 486 Mich 963, 965 (2010)\n(YOUNG, J., dissenting); Idalski v Schwedt, 486 Mich 916, 918 (2010) (YOUNG, J.,\ndissenting); People v Feezel, 486 Mich 184, 221 n 13; 783 NW2d 67 (2010) (YOUNG, J.,\ndissenting); Lansing Sch Ed Ass’n v Lansing Bd of Ed, 485 Mich 966 (2009) (YOUNG, J.,\ndissenting); Hoover v Mich Mut Ins Co, 485 Mich 881, 882 (2009) (YOUNG, J.,\ndissenting); Lenawee Co Bd of Rd Comm’rs v State Auto Prop & Cas Ins Co, 485 Mich\n853, 856 (2009) (YOUNG, J., dissenting).\n\fCourt. They are manifestly incorrect. To be clear, my remark reflected my desire to\n\n“undo . . . the damage” done to the good reputation of this Court as an institution during\n\nthe former majority’s tenure.2 My only “agenda” was and is to restore nationwide respect\n\nto this Court and to chart a new course of civility.3 Of course, I do not control Justice\n\nYOUNG’s pen. His dissenting opinion demonstrates that my efforts in the area of civility\n\nhave not yet been as successful as I hoped.\n\n      Written opinions serve an important function in the judicial process: they provide\n\na forum in which the majority and dissenting justices debate the legal issues raised in\n\ncases. Sometimes that debate focuses on a narrow question. Other times, the debate\n\n\n\n      2\n        See Liptak, Unfettered Debate Takes Unflattering Turn in Michigan Supreme\nCourt, NY Times, January 19, 2007, available at <http://www.nytimes.com/2007/\n01/19/us/19michigan.html?_r=1> (accessed July 28, 2010).\n      3\n         I do not find it “disquieting” that Justice YOUNG quotes my remark. Rather, I\nfind it disquieting that Justices YOUNG and CORRIGAN conclude in a legal opinion that\nthe remark was made with a “dreadful,” “disquieting,” and “scurrilous” intent.\n\n       In regard to the quoted portion of my statement referring to my pledge to not sleep\non the bench, Justice YOUNG does not tell the whole story. The day after I was elected\nChief Justice, I was specifically asked if I had been referring to former Chief Justice\nTAYLOR in my statement. As the Detroit Free Press explained:\n\n             Outside the hearing, Kelly pledged to seek common ground with her\n      colleagues and said her comment about the sleeping on the bench was\n      metaphorical, not meant as an endorsement of the Democratic Party ad\n      attacking Taylor. She said she had not seen him sleeping during the case\n      the ad cited. [Dawson Bell, Statewide: After 10 Years of the GOP, Dem to\n      Lead High Court, Detroit Free Press, January 9, 2009, at 3B.]\n\nAs I indicated then, I will not engage in character assassinations of my current or former\ncolleagues.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fextends to broader legal questions with wider implications, such as the doctrine of stare\n\ndecisis, a particularly controversial matter.\n\n        It is no secret that the philosophical divisions among the justices on this Court are\n\ndeep.       For some years now, our disagreements on legal questions have erupted in\n\noccasionally heated and unpleasant personal recriminations.         This case is a perfect\n\nexample.4\n\n        I know that, if asked, both Justices YOUNG and CORRIGAN would agree with my\n\nsentiments and would deplore these outbursts.         Both justices fully understand that\n\npersonal recriminations reduce the public’s confidence in the objectivity and wisdom of\n\njudges and in the Court as an institution.\n\n        With these reflections in mind, I urge them to reevaluate the utility of their ad\n\nhominem attacks and eliminate them. Surely each has significant confidence in the\n\nstrength of their legal arguments to allow those arguments to stand on their merits, absent\n\ndistracting attack props. Moreover, their personal assaults do nothing to resolve the legal\n\nissues before us; they do not benefit the parties to a case or the citizens of Michigan\n\nwhom we serve.\n\n        I sincerely regret having to address these matters in the first place and would\n\nprefer that this opinion were not necessary. But I cannot stand passively by and allow\n\n        4\n         The quotations cited by Justice YOUNG, post at ___ n ___, accurately point out\nstrong language I have used in the past to criticize the former majority’s legal reasoning\nin various cases. But this is far different from Justice YOUNG’s criticism today, the chief\npurpose of which is to impugn my motives in reaching legal conclusions, thus attacking\nmy character.\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fJustices YOUNG and CORRIGAN to accuse me and the justices in the “new majority” of\n\nbeing unprincipled and driven by inappropriate motives. Their attacks wrongly accuse\n\nJustices CAVANAGH, WEAVER, HATHAWAY, and me of reaching predetermined outcomes\n\nin many, if not all, cases rather than following the law, as we are sworn to do.\n\n       People respect the judiciary only insofar as they believe that judges decide cases\n\nimpartially and without ulterior motives. Justices YOUNG’s and CORRIGAN’s assertion in\n\nthis and previous cases that we have an “agenda” that involves selecting and overturning\n\ncertain precedents is unfair and untrue. Furthermore, it undermines respect both for the\n\njustices attacked and for those making the unwarranted accusations. Most importantly, it\n\nreduces public confidence in the judiciary as a whole.\n\n\n                                                         Marilyn Kelly\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f                             STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                    SUPREME COURT\n\n\nREGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN and UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN HEALTH SYSTEM,\n\n               Plaintiffs-Appellants,\n\nv                                                            No. 136905\n\nTITAN INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n               Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\nYOUNG, J.

After a decade of dissents in which Justices CAVANAGH,\n\nWEAVER, and KELLY played the recurrent theme that they were hawk-like adherents to\n\nstare decisis,3 attacking the then majority—Justices TAYLOR, CORRIGAN, MARKMAN, and\n\nme—for failing to preserve cases with whose results they agreed,4 today precedent is no\n\n\n      3\n         See, e.g., Pohutski v City of Allen Park, 465 Mich 675, 712; 641 NW2d 219\n(2002) (KELLY, J., dissenting) (“[I]f each successive Court, believing its reading is\ncorrect and past readings wrong, rejects precedent, then the law will fluctuate from year\nto year, rendering our jurisprudence dangerously unstable.”); People v Hawkins, 468\nMich 488, 517-518; 668 NW2d 602 (2003) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (“‘We have\noverruled our precedents when the intervening development of the law has “removed or\nweakened the conceptual underpinnings from the prior decision, or where the later law\nhas rendered the decision irreconcilable with competing legal doctrines or policies.” . . .\nAbsent those changes or compelling evidence bearing on Congress’ original intent . . .\nour system demands that we adhere to our prior interpretations of statutes.’”), quoting\nNeal v United States, 516 US 284, 295; 116 S Ct 763; 133 L Ed 2d 709 (1996), quoting\nPatterson v McLean Credit Union, 491 US 164, 173; 109 S Ct 2363; 105 L Ed 2d 132\n(1989); Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, 477 Mich 197, 278; 731 NW2d 41 (2007)\n(CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (‘“Under the doctrine of stare decisis, principles of law\ndeliberately examined and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction become precedent\nwhich should not be lightly departed.’”), quoting People v Jamieson, 436 Mich 61, 79;\n461 NW2d 884 (1990); Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 473 Mich 562, 622; 702 NW2d\n539 (2005) (WEAVER, J., dissenting) (“Correction for correction’s sake does not make\nsense. The case has not been made why the Court should not adhere to the doctrine of\nstare decisis in this case.”).\n      4\n          In addition to the vigorous responses to these charges that each justice—\nTAYLOR, CORRIGAN, MARKMAN, and I—gave in our respective cases, Justice MARKMAN\nhas already explored, at great length, the general charge that the former majority was\ndisrespectful of precedent. See Rowland, 477 Mich at 223-247 (MARKMAN, J.,\nconcurring). His conclusions demonstrate quite the opposite: that while we did, in fact,\noverrule some prior cases, those precedents had either failed to follow even more\nestablished precedents from this Court or failed to accord the appropriate and text-based\nmeaning to the words of this state’s statutes or constitution. Moreover, we specifically\nset forth a test explaining the explicit standards by which a case would be reviewed in\ndetermining whether overruling it would be appropriate. See Robinson v Detroit, 462\nMich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000). Notably, this test is the only test to garner support\nfrom a majority of this Court, even though all members of the new majority now treat it,\n\n\n                                            2\n\flonger an “issue.” Nor is precedent now an issue for my newest colleague, Justice\n\nHATHAWAY, although her campaigns for election to the Court of Appeals and this Court\n\nfeatured prominently her position adamantly proclaiming an absolutist support for stare\n\ndecisis.5\n\n       The new majority, being a majority, is now free to do as it pleases. And it pleases\n\nthe new majority to honor the agenda to which our new Chief Justice pledged them after\n\nthe defeat of Chief Justice TAYLOR in 2008:\n\n              We the new majority [Chief Justice KELLY and Justices CAVANAGH,\n       WEAVER, and HATHAWAY] will get the ship off the shoals and back on\n       course, and we will undo a great deal of the damage that the Republican-\n       dominated court has done. Not only will we not neglect our duties, we will\n       not sleep on the bench.[6]\n\nThe new majority has not been shy about acting on its agenda to “undo” the precedents of\n\nthe “Republican-dominated court.” In the 18 months of its existence, the new majority\n\nhas moved muscularly in making good on this promise. Just in this term alone, the new\n\nmajority has overturned the following cases recently decided by this Court:\n\nalternatively, as “one among many varying approaches” or, worse still, not existent at all.\nSee, e.g., Lansing Sch Ed Ass’n v Lansing Bd of Ed, __ Mich __; __ NW2d __ (2010).\nThese standards stand in sharp contrast to the actions of the new majority and, in\nparticular, the legal relativism espoused by the concurring opinions today.\n       5\n        Berg, Hathaway attacks, Michigan Lawyers Weekly, October 27, 2008 (“‘People\nneed to know what the law is,’ Hathaway said. ‘I believe in stare decisis.

(calling into question the continued\nvalidity of Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, 465 Mich 53; 631 NW2d 686 (2001),\nregarding the doctrine of lost opportunity to survive, even though O’Neal in no way\ninvolved a claim for lost opportunity to survive).\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\foverruling cases this term when, last term, it simply ignored or implicitly overruled them,\n\nthe new majority has become more aggressive in achieving its policy agenda.\n\n       It is a touch more than ironic that Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY now argue\n\nthat well-established principles of stare decisis must give way to a justice’s subjective\n\nview of a case. This process produces a result whereby the parties and the public will\n\nnever know what criteria or standards several justices on this Court will employ until\n\nafter the decision has been made. This ad hoc, subjective process is the very antithesis of\n\nthe “rule of law” and instead denotes a system hijacked by the concurring justices, who\n\nappear to be guided and constrained only by their personal beliefs. That stare decisis is a\n\n“principle of policy,” as Justice HATHAWAY repeats many times, does not mean that\n\nanalysis of a case pursuant to the doctrine should be driven by each judge’s personal\n\npolicy choices.10 Nor does the fact that stare decisis is a “principle of policy” mean that\n\njudges need not announce a fixed set of principles that will guide their decisions.11 Yet\n\n\n       10\n          In particular, Justice HATHAWAY apparently fails to understand that stare\ndecisis, even as a principle of judicial policy, does not equate with a judge making\nindividual “policy determination[s],” ante at ___, as if she were a citizen-legislator. As\nany student of the law can explain, her theory represents the precise opposite principle\nthat governs courts in a society based on the rule of law. Judges serve an important yet\nlimited role in a constitutional republic. Not being of the policy-making branches of\ngovernment, they should never base their decisions on their own subjective policy beliefs.\nIf nothing else, Justice HATHAWAY’s admission that she is making her own personal\n“policy determination[s]” in cases at least provides a view into what has driven many of\nthe decisions produced by the new majority.\n       11\n           My criticism of Justice WEAVER’s approach is not, as she alleges, that she has\nsubscribed to a theory of stare decisis as an “inexorable command” that she now rejects.\nIn fact, it is precisely the opposite: She often subscribes to no objective test whatsoever.\nCases from time to time may need to be overruled, but the ultimate problem with Justice\n\n\n                                             6\n\fthis is precisely what characterizes Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY’s unique brand of\n\nfeckless jurisprudence announced today.\n\n       The rule of law, by definition, requires judges to decide cases on the basis of\n\nprinciples, announced in advance, rather than on a personal or subjective preference for\n\nor against a party before them. This ensures stability in the law despite the diversity of\n\njudges’ personal beliefs. Whether we, as judges, “like” the outcome is, quite simply,\n\nirrelevant to whether it reflects a correct conclusion of law. It is harrowing that Justices\n\n\n\nWEAVER’s approach is that she relies on her subjective application of “judicial restraint,\ncommon sense, and sense of fairness—justice for all,” rather than any defined legal\nstandard in making these decisions. And unlike her prior protests that “[c]orrection for\ncorrection’s sake does not make sense,” Devillers, 473 Mich at 622, Justice WEAVER is\nnow working to “correct” and overrule as many recent precedents as possible. Worse\nstill, she is content to do so without any serious stare decisis analysis as long as doing so\ndoes not offend her subjective “sense of fairness.” And, as the public is no doubt aware,\n“common sense” is not so common and Justice WEAVER has no greater fund of common\nsense than anyone else. If for no other reason, that is why simply “following the law” is\nthe best course for any serious jurist committed to the “rule of law” rather than the “rule\nof judges.”\n\n        Justice WEAVER also selectively quotes without context a passage from an\nextended law review article that I authored. See Robert P. Young, Jr., A judicial\ntraditionalist confronts the common law, 8 Texas Rev L & Pol 299 (2004). The article\nwas designed to highlight, in an arresting way, how difficult it should be for any judge\ncommitted to the rule of law to make the difficult policy choices necessary when\nmodifying the common law. Quite simply, policy-making in the judiciary is one of least\ndesirable and most difficult things for judges to do. This is because it is hard to assess\nthe trade-offs that competing policies might create, especially when, unlike the\nLegislature, judges cannot consider the competing policy positions of interest groups\naffected by the issue in question. However, since Justice WEAVER is not committed to\nthe rule of law, but instead applies her brand of “common sense,” she has no qualms with\njudicial policy-making in any context—common law or otherwise. This fact is attested to\nby her concurrence here and illustrated in recent decisions handed down by the new\nmajority that she has signed.\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fWEAVER and HATHAWAY either do not understand this concept or refuse to subscribe to\n\nit, preferring to base their decisions on subjective “policy consideration[s].”\n\n       Finally, Chief Justice KELLY has tried on several occasions to explain away what\n\nshe meant when she said the “new majority” would “undo . . . the damage [of] the\n\nRepublican-dominated court,” as she again attempts today. Chief Justice KELLY finds it\n\ndisquieting that I quote her remarks about the “new majority’s” agenda. She should. Her\n\nremarks are as disquieting as they are scurrilous. What is noteworthy is that Chief\n\nJustice KELLY has never repudiated what she said, apologized for it, or sufficiently\n\nexplained why that statement doesn’t mean what it plainly says. Instead, she merely\n\nprefers that I not repeat it for reasons that are obvious to all. Rare is it that a judge\n\npublicly tells the public that she has an agenda and what it is. I am glad that the Chief\n\nJustice was so candid because everyone can examine her conduct in light of her\n\nstatement. Her motivations for making this dreadful remark and whether her subsequent\n\nresolution of cases is consistent with her remark are questions for the public to decide.\n\n       Moreover, after being the target of much uncivil criticism by then Justice KELLY\n\nover the years, I am nonplussed by the Chief Justice’s pique at the passion of my dissent\n\nand the tone in which I have expressed it. One need only review the Chief Justice’s\n\ndissenting opinions over the years to acknowledge that her views on civility have\n\nconveniently changed as quickly as the new majority’s view regarding the importance of\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fpreserving precedent.12 Now that she is part of this Court’s philosophical majority, her\n\ncriticism of my impassioned tone recalls a line from Shakespeare: “The lady doth protest\n\ntoo much, methinks.”13\n\n\n       12\n          See, e.g., People v Smith, 478 Mich 292, 331, 335 n 4, 339 n 13; 733 NW2d 351\n(2007) (KELLY, J., dissenting) (accusing the majority of “again unnecessarily chip[ing]\naway at the Double Jeopardy Clause” and “mangling” double jeopardy jurisprudence and\nnoting that “in its zeal, [the majority] will at times punish a defendant twice for the same\noffense.”); Rowland, 477 Mich at 256-257 & n 13, 266 (KELLY, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (“The majority has ordained itself master of such ‘higher law’ [i.e.,\nlaw ‘“manufactured for each special occasion out of our own private feelings and\nopinions”’]. In doing so, it undermines the stability of Michigan’s courts and damages\nthe integrity of the judicial process.”; among other charges, Justice KELLY also alleged\nthat the majority had launched an “unprecedented attack on stare decisis,” was\n“overturning precedent will-nilly,” and “disrespect[ed] . . . past justices of the Michigan\nSupreme Court.”) (citation omitted); Rory v Continental Ins Co, 473 Mich 457, 492; 703\nNW2d 23 (2005) (KELLY, J., dissenting) (“The majority’s decision constitutes a serious\nregression in Michigan law, and it gives new meaning to the term ‘judicial activism.’ . . .\n[T]he majority [reaches an unnecessary issue], apparently using this dispute as a vehicle\nto reshape the law on adhesion contracts more closely to its own desires.”); People v\nDavis, 472 Mich 156, 190; 695 NW2d 45 (2005) (KELLY, J., dissenting) (“[The majority]\ndestabilizes our state’s jurisprudence. It suggests to the public that the law is at the whim\nof whoever is sitting on the Supreme Court bench. Surely, it erodes the public’s\nconfidence in our judicial system.”); Terrien v Zwit, 467 Mich 56, 92; 648 NW2d 602\n(2002) (KELLY, J., dissenting) (characterizing the majority opinion as “the embodiment of\njudge-made law” because, to Justice KELLY, it “engrafts its own version of what the law\nshould be” and “discard[s] the knowledge and wisdom of those who came before the\ncurrent Court”); Sington v Chrysler Corp, 467 Mich 144, 179 n 8, 180, 184; 648 NW2d\n624 (2002) (KELLY, J., dissenting) (characterizing her actions as “a matter of not falling\nprey to a zealot’s conviction that what has been done in the past by others has been\nsimply wrong . . . . “When a Court pays no more than lip service to [stare decisis], the\nbasic integrity of the legal system itself is shaken . . . . So it is that, in the history of this\nand of the vast majority of supreme courts across the land, overrulings of precedent are\ninfrequent. Yet, quite the opposite is true of the present Michigan Supreme Court. It is\nfor that reason that, the majority’s pronouncements to the contrary notwithstanding, one\nmay wonder whether reasoned adherence to stare decisis may properly be considered a\npolicy of this Court.”); Robinson, 462 Mich at 491 (KELLY, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (“The majority’s casual disregard for this Court’s past opinions\nsuggests to future courts that they do the same and creates instability in the law of this\n\n\n                                                9\n\f       Moreover, the Chief Justice’s calls for civility are especially hypocritical given the\n\nvery ugly reference she made to the false “sleeping judge” ads that played so prominent a\n\nrole in the campaign to defeat Chief Justice TAYLOR in 2008. Given the context that this\n\nremark was made just after the defeat of Chief Justice TAYLOR in the last election, Chief\n\nJustice KELLY’s final comment that “we will not sleep on the bench” was a particularly\n\nuncivil reference denigrating our distinguished former colleague.14 Chief Justice KELLY\n\nwas present during the arguments of the case in which it was falsely asserted that Chief\n\nJustice TAYLOR fell asleep, and she knew, or should have known, that the claim was\n\nfalse. These facts are impossible to square with her current desire to improve civility\n\namong members of the Court.\n\n       The public should be just as indignant as I am—not only regarding the hypocrisy\n\nof the new majority’s radically changing views on the question of preserving precedents,\n\nbut also with its equally radically subjective approach to the law. I will continue to strive\n\nto bring such issues to the public’s attention. The public may judge whether the former\n\nmajority or this new majority’s opinions provided greater predictability in the law and\n\nwere more faithful to the actual language of the statutes, or whether the legislative “work\n\nstate. The reasons proffered to overrule [the past precedents] are based solely on the\nmajority’s subjective, contrived interpretation of the statutes involved.”).\n       13\n            Shakespeare, Hamlet, act 3, sc 2 (Gertrude, Queen of Denmark).\n       14\n          It is this context that makes her after-the-fact rationalization that she was merely\nbeing “metaphorical” hard to believe. The credibility of her explanation for this is a\nmatter for the public to decide, as is the credibility of her explanation that her statement\ndoes not refer to a substantive agenda to overturn jurisprudence decided by the prior\nmajority.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fproduct” was disregarded for the pet policies of the several justices who formed these\n\nrespective majorities. Indeed, in a constitutional republic where judges are elected, it is\n\nthe obligation of the public to do just that. Otherwise, for the foreseeable future, the\n\npublic can look forward to more “damage control” in the form of brash judicial activism\n\nfrom the new majority.\n\n\n       CORRIGAN, J., concurred with YOUNG, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f                            STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                  SUPREME COURT\n\n\nREGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN and UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM,\n\n             Plaintiffs-Appellants,\n\nv                                                          No. 136905\n\nTITAN INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n             Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\nMARKMAN, J.

However, after the composition of this Court changed\nwhen Justice HATHAWAY replaced former Chief Justice TAYLOR on January 1, 2009, this\nCourt granted plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration even though the motion did not raise\nany new legal arguments. 484 Mich 852 (2009).\n\f      MCL 500.3145(1), part of the no-fault automobile insurance act, provides, in\n\npertinent part: “[T]he claimant may not recover benefits for any portion of the loss\n\nincurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced.”2\n\n(Emphasis added.) This is known as the one-year-back rule. MCL 600.5821(4), part of\n\nthe Revised Judicature Act (RJA), provides, in pertinent part:\n\n              Actions brought in the name of . . . any political subdivision of the\n      state of Michigan[3] . . . for the recovery of the cost of maintenance, care,\n      and treatment of persons in hospitals . . . are not subject to the statute of\n      limitations and may be brought at any time without limitation, the\n      provisions of any statute notwithstanding. [Emphasis added.]\n\n\n\n\n      2\n          In its entirety, MCL 500.3145(1) provides:\n\n              An action for recovery of personal protection insurance benefits\n      payable under this chapter for accidental bodily injury may not be\n      commenced later than 1 year after the date of the accident causing the\n      injury unless written notice of injury as provided herein has been given to\n      the insurer within 1 year after the accident or unless the insurer has\n      previously made a payment of personal protection insurance benefits for the\n      injury. If the notice has been given or a payment has been made, the action\n      may be commenced at any time within 1 year after the most recent\n      allowable expense, work loss or survivor’s loss has been incurred.\n      However, the claimant may not recover benefits for any portion of the loss\n      incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was\n      commenced. The notice of injury required by this subsection may be given\n      to the insurer or any of its authorized agents by a person claiming to be\n      entitled to benefits therefore, or by someone in his behalf. The notice shall\n      give the name and address of the claimant and indicate in ordinary language\n      the name of the person injured and the time, place and nature of his injury.\n      [Emphasis added.]\n      3\n          It is undisputed that the University of Michigan Health System constitutes a\npolitical subdivision of the state of Michigan for purposes of this statute.\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f      In Cameron, this Court held that the minority/insanity tolling provision of the\n\nRJA, MCL 600.5851(1), which addresses when one may “bring [an] action,”4 does not\n\npreclude the application of the no-fault automobile insurance act’s one-year-back rule\n\nbecause the latter only limits the amount of benefits that can be recovered, i.e., the one-\n\nyear-back rule is a damages-limiting provision rather than a statute of limitations. See\n\nalso Howard v Gen Motors Corp, 427 Mich 358, 385-386; 399 NW2d 10 (1986) (lead\n\nopinion by BRICKLEY, J.) (explaining that the one- and two-year-back rules of the\n\nWorker’s Disability Compensation Act are not statutes of limitations).5 I continue to\n\nbelieve that Cameron was correctly decided.\n\n\n\n      4\n          MCL 600.5851(1), in its entirety, provides:\n\n             Except as otherwise provided in [MCL 600.5851(7) and (8)], if the\n      person first entitled to make an entry or bring an action under this act is\n      under 18 years of age or insane at the time the claim accrues, the person or\n      those claiming under the person shall have 1 year after the disability is\n      removed through death or otherwise, to make the entry or bring the action\n      although the period of limitations has run. This section does not lessen the\n      time provided for in section 5852. [Emphasis added.]\n      5\n         As explained in Howard about the one- and two-year-back rules of the Worker’s\nDisability Compensation Act:\n\n             A statute of limitations “represents a legislative determination of that\n      reasonable period of time that a claimant will be given in which to file an\n      action.” Lothian v Detroit, 414 Mich 160, 165; 324 NW2d 9 (1982).\n\n                                          * * *\n\n              Thus, relying on these very basic definitions of statutes of\n      limitations, the one- and two-year-back rule statutes may not be so\n      categorized. Simply stated, they are not statutes that limit the period of\n      time in which a claimant may file an action. Rather, they concern the time\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       The one-year-back rule “limits the amount of personal protection insurance (PIP)\n\nbenefits recoverable to those incurred within one year before the action was\n\ncommenced.” Cameron, 476 Mich at 58 n 1. As Cameron explained:\n\n               By its unambiguous terms, MCL 600.5851(1) concerns when a\n       minor or person suffering from insanity may “make the entry or bring the\n       action.” It does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an action has\n       been brought. MCL 600.5851(1) then is irrelevant to the damages-limiting\n       one-year-back provision of MCL 500.3145(1). Thus, to be clear, the\n       minority/insanity tolling provision in MCL 600.5851(1) does not operate to\n       toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1). [Id. at 62.]\n\nThat is, the one-year-back rule by its straightforward language serves only as a limitation\n\non the recovery of benefits; it does not define a period within which a claimant may file a\n\ncause of action. Therefore, the one-year-back rule is not a statute of limitations, and it\n\nlies outside the scope of what is affected by the RJA’s minority/insanity tolling provision.\n\n\n\n\n       period for which compensation may be awarded once a determination of\n       rights thereto has been made.\n\n             Moreover, the one- and two-year-back rules do not serve the same\n       purposes as do typical statutes of limitations.\n\n                                          * * *\n\n              . . . The rules do not perform the functions traditionally associated\n       with statutes of limitations because they do not operate to cut off a claim,\n       but merely limit the remedy obtainable. They do not disallow the action or\n       the recovery—a petition may be filed long after an injury and benefits may\n       be awarded in response thereto—they merely limit the award once it has\n       been granted.\n\n              Therefore, on the basis of the language of the rules, we perceive no\n       logical reason for characterizing the one- and two-year-back rules as\n       statutes of limitations. [Howard, 427 Mich at 384-387 (lead opinion by\n       BRICKLEY, J.).]\n\n\n                                             4\n\f              The tolling provision of MCL 600.5851(1) tolls the limitation that\n      applies to the “bring[ing of an] action”; however, it does not toll the\n      limitation that applies to the “recover[y of] benefits,” in particular the\n      limitation set forth in MCL 500.3145(1). Accordingly, although a plaintiff\n      may not be prohibited from “bring[ing] the action,” a plaintiff is prohibited\n      from “recover[ing] benefits for any portion of the loss incurred more than 1\n      year before the date on which the action was commenced.” [Id. at 77\n      (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]\n\n      The majority apparently believes that it is appropriate to overrule Cameron\n\nbecause Cameron overruled Geiger v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch, 114 Mich App 283;\n\n318 NW2d 833 (1982).6 First, Geiger was a Court of Appeals decision, and thus not\n\nbinding upon this Court.7 Catalina Mktg Sales Corp v Dep’t of Treasury, 470 Mich 13,\n\n23; 678 NW2d 619 (2004). Second, as Cameron itself explained:\n\n\n      6\n          Justice WEAVER would also overrule Cameron because it is inconsistent with\n“the reasons in [her] dissent to the Cameron decision.” In her dissent, she concluded that\nthe one-year-back rule applies when the plaintiff is able to bring an action beyond one\nyear from the date of the accident because he provided notice or was previously paid\nbenefits, but does not apply when notice was not provided and benefits were not\npreviously paid. However, as Cameron itself explained, 476 Mich at 69-72, such a\nconclusion is inconsistent with the clear language of MCL 500.3145(1), which contains\nthree pertinent provisions. The first provides that if notice was not provided and benefits\nwere not previously paid, the action must be filed within one year after the accident. The\nsecond provides that if notice was provided or benefits were previously paid, the action\nmust be filed within one year after the most recent allowable loss was incurred. And the\nthird, known as the one-year-back rule, provides that losses incurred more than one year\nbefore an action was filed cannot be recovered. There is no indication whatsoever in the\nstatute that the Legislature intended that the third provision only apply where notice has\nbeen provided or benefits have been previously paid.\n      7\n          Moreover, contrary to the majority’s suggestions, Cameron is not at all\ninconsistent with Lambert v Calhoun, 394 Mich 179, 181; 229 NW2d 332 (1975), which\nheld that the minority/insanity tolling provision of the RJA “extends the time for bringing\nsuit under an act which contains its own statute of limitations”; with Rawlins v Aetna Cas\n& Surety Co, 92 Mich App 268; 284 NW2d 782 (1979), which held that the\nminority/insanity tolling provision of the RJA applies to the period of limitations\n\n\n                                            5\n\f              In reaching this conclusion the Court of Appeals [in Geiger], looking\n       behind the language of the statute and focusing on its understanding of the\n       Legislature’s purported intent, determined that the legislative purpose\n       behind the minority/insanity tolling provision for periods of limitations was\n       to preserve not only a person’s cause of action during the period of\n       disability but also the person’s damage claims. It opined that to not read\n       the statute in this fashion would “severely limit the utility” of the\n       minority/insanity tolling provision. The Court then concluded that, “[i]n\n       order to advance the policy of RJA § 5851,” the minority/insanity tolling\n       provision applies to prevent the capping of damages under the one-year-\n       back rule of MCL 500.3145(1).\n\n              We believe this ruling was erroneous for the most uncomplicated\n       reason; namely, that we must assume that the thing the Legislature wants is\n       best understood by reading what it said. Because what was said in MCL\n       500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1) is clear, no less clear is the policy.\n       Damages are only allowed for one year back from the date the lawsuit is\n       filed. We are enforcing the statutes as written. While some may question\n       the wisdom of the Legislature’s capping damages in this fashion, it is\n       unquestionably a power that the Legislature has under our Constitution.\n       Thus, because Geiger’s conclusion that the minority/insanity tolling\n       provision applies to extend the one-year-back rule is contrary to what the\n       Legislature clearly directed in MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1),\n       Geiger is overruled. [Cameron, 476 Mich at 63-64.]\n\n\n\ncontained in the no-fault automobile insurance act; with Kleinschrodt v Gen Motors\nCorp, 402 Mich 381; 263 NW2d 246 (1978), which held that the one-year-back rule of\nthe Worker’s Disability Compensation Act is a defense that can be waived; or with\nWelton v Carriers Ins Co, 421 Mich 571; 365 NW2d 170 (1984), which held that the one-\nyear-back rule of the no-fault act is not tolled by submitting a general notice of injury to\nthe insurer that does include a claim for specific benefits. Indeed, no case other than\nGeiger has held that the minority/insanity tolling provision of the RJA applies to the one-\nyear-back rule of the no-fault act. Although the lead opinion characterizes Welton as\nholding “that the one-year-back rule does not apply to claims preserved by an applicable\ntolling or saving provision,” and accuses Cameron of “implicitly overrul[ing] Welton,”\nWelton held no such thing. Welton’s statement that “[a]pplying the tolling to both the\nlimitation period and the period of recovery accords with common sense” is clearly\ndictum because Welton held that tolling did not apply in that case. Welton, 421 Mich at\n577 n 2. Further, Welton involved judicial tolling, not the statutory minority/insanity\ntolling provision that was at issue in Cameron.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f       The majority here commits the same error that Geiger committed. That is, the\n\nmajority believes that it can somehow discern the purpose of the statute from something\n\nother than its actual language, despite the fact that this Court has repeatedly held that this\n\nconstitutes an improper approach to statutory interpretation.        As I explained in my\n\nconcurring opinion in Cameron:\n\n               In Geiger v Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins Exch, 114 Mich App 283;\n       318 NW2d 833 (1982), the Court of Appeals held that the minority/insanity\n       tolling provision does toll the one-year-back rule of the no-fault automobile\n       insurance act. However, the only reason it gave for reaching such a\n       conclusion is that “[a] contrary rule would severely limit the utility of the\n       minority saving provision . . . .” Id. at 291. I do not necessarily disagree\n       with Geiger that not tolling the one-year-back rule may well “limit the\n       utility” of the tolling provision, perhaps even “severely,” but that is often\n       what happens when there are statutes that are in tension with one another.\n       It can be argued just as easily that to do the opposite, to toll the one-year-\n       back rule, would be to “severely limit the utility” of the one-year-back rule.\n       Indeed, it can be argued that to toll the one-year-back rule is not merely to\n       “severely limit its utility,” but to do it even greater damage by vitiating its\n       language altogether.[8] In the end, the Geiger rationale is not even a legal\n       rationale at all; rather, it is little more than a statement by the majority in\n       Geiger that it preferred a different statute than the one actually enacted by\n       the Legislature. [Id. at 83-84 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]\n\nThe majority criticizes Cameron on the basis that “[t]he only authority cited for [its]\n\ninterpretation was in Justice MARKMAN’s concurring opinion, which relied on dicta from\n\nJustice BRICKLEY’s lead opinion in Howard v Gen Motors Corp.” This statement very\n\nmuch illustrates the flaw in the majority’s approach to statutory construction-- it fails to\n\n\n       8\n          It is ironic that the majority accuses the Cameron majority of “read[ing] the\nstatutory language in isolation,” when it is the majority here that reads the\nminority/insanity tolling provision in a manner so far isolated from the one-year-back\nrule of the no-fault act that it gives the latter no meaning whatsoever.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\frecognize that the best indicator of the Legislature’s intent is the language of the statute\n\nitself. That is, the best “authority” cited in either the majority or concurring opinions in\n\nCameron for their interpretation is the actual language of the statutes at issue. That the\n\nmajority fails to apprehend this first principle of statutory interpretation sufficiently\n\nspeaks to the shortcomings in its analysis.\n\n       Finally, with regard to the majority’s apparent belief that it is somehow\n\nappropriate to overrule Cameron because Cameron overruled Geiger, even if Geiger was\n\ncontrolling precedent-- which it is not-- the majority errs by conflating all precedents as\n\ndeserving of equal respect.     However, as I explained in my concurring opinion in\n\nRowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, 477 Mich 197, 226; 731 NW2d 41 (2007), “not all\n\nprecedents are built alike . . . .” Indeed, “some are better reasoned than others, . . . some\n\nare grounded in the exercise of discretionary judgments and others in the interpretation of\n\nplain language, [and] some are thorough in their analyses and others superficial.” Id. As\n\ndiscussed earlier, while Cameron entailed a serious effort to interpret the language of the\n\nlaw and to render our case-law consistent with this language, Geiger, as also explained\n\nearlier, was principally grounded in a desire to advance the policy of the\n\nminority/insanity tolling provision over the policy of the one-year-back rule of the no-\n\nfault act. For these reasons, Cameron’s overruling of Geiger can hardly be equated with\n\nthe majority’s overruling of Cameron.         The former entailed an effort to render the\n\ncaselaw of our state more consistent with the intentions of the Legislature, while the latter\n\nrenders it less consistent. The majority has never quite grasped that the issue of stare\n\ndecisis is one that cannot be viewed exclusively in quantitative terms, but must also be\n\n\n                                              8\n\fviewed in qualitative terms. By indiscriminately placing on equal footing all decisions of\n\nthis Court that overrule precedent, without considering whether each does so in order to\n\nfurther the intentions of the lawmaker or to further the intentions of the judge, the\n\nmajority communicates well the flaws in its understandings of stare decisis and of the\n\njudicial role itself.\n\n       In Liptow, the Court of Appeals, relying on this Court’s decision in Cameron, held\n\nthat MCL 600.5821(4) does not preclude the application of the one-year-back rule\n\nbecause MCL 600.5821(4) only exempts the state and its political subdivisions from a\n\nstatute of limitations and the one-year-back rule is a damages-limiting provision, not a\n\nstatute of limitations. This Court denied leave to appeal in Liptow, 478 Mich 853 (2007),\n\nand I agree with the Court of Appeals’ decision. As the Court of Appeals explained in\n\nLiptow:\n\n              MCL 600.5821(4) provides that actions brought by the state or its\n       subdivisions to recover the cost of maintenance, care, and treatment of\n       persons in state institutions “are not subject to the statute of limitations and\n       may be brought at any time without limitation, the provisions of any statute\n       notwithstanding.” We conclude that, by the plain import of this language,\n       the Legislature intended to exempt the state from statutes of limitations\n       when bringing an action to recover public funds. The language refers to\n       statutes of limitations and provides that an action may be brought at any\n       time. But the statute does not address damage limitation provisions or any\n       other limiting provisions. In other words, like the minority tolling\n       provision, MCL 600.5821(4) concerns the time during which the state may\n       bring an action; it “does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an\n       action has been brought.” Cameron, supra, 476 Mich at 62. Accordingly,\n       we conclude that MCL 600.5821(4), like the minority tolling provision of\n       MCL 600.5851(1), does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule of MCL\n       500.3145(1). Cameron, supra, 476 Mich at 61-62. [Liptow, 272 Mich App\n       at 555-556 (emphasis in the original).]\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fWhile the RJA, specifically MCL 600.5821(4), states that an action by the state or one of\n\nits political subdivisions “may be brought at any time without limitation,” the no-fault\n\nact, specifically MCL 500.3145(1), states that the claimant “may not recover benefits for\n\nany portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was\n\ncommenced.” (Emphasis added.) Having the right to bring a cause of action is not the\n\nequivalent of having the right to recover an unlimited amount of damages.9 Therefore,\n\nwhen these two provisions are read together, it is clear that while a political subdivision\n\nmay bring an action at any time, it cannot recover benefits for any portion of the loss\n\nincurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced. In other\n\nwords, MCL 600.5821(4), which pertains only to when an action may be commenced,\n\ndoes not preclude the application of the one-year-back rule, which only limits how much\n\ncan be recovered after the action has been commenced.\n\n       The majority overrules Liptow simply because it relied on Cameron. Because I\n\nbelieve that Cameron was correctly decided and that Liptow appropriately relied on\n\nCameron, I would not overrule either Cameron or Liptow. As is obvious from the flood\n\nof opinions that the majority has recently overruled, the majority justices’ repeated self-\n\nproclamations of adherence to stare decisis were merely a reflection of the fact that they\n\nagreed with the particular decisions that were being overruled. For a more thorough\n\ndiscussion of the majority justices’ past expressions of fealty toward stare decisis, see my\n\n\n       9\n           Indeed, the one-year-back rule may be more analogous to a cap on damages than\nit is to a statute of limitations.\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fdissent in McCormick v Carrier, __ Mich __, __; __ NW2d __ (2010). However, the\n\nlead opinion’s reliance on Chief Justice KELLY’s opinion in Petersen v Magna Corp, 484\n\nMich 300; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), which only Justice CAVANAGH joined, rather than the\n\nmajority opinion in Robinson v Detroit, 462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), should not\n\ngo unnoticed. For a thorough discussion of Chief Justice KELLY’s Petersen standard for\n\noverruling precedent, see my dissent in Petersen, 484 Mich at 350.10\n\n\n      10\n           Justice HATHAWAY contends that stare decisis constitutes a “policy\nconsideration” and that the “particular analytical approach will differ from case to case.”\nSimilarly, Justice WEAVER contends that stare decisis constitutes a “principle of policy”\nand that there is no need for a “standardized test for stare decisis,” as long as justices\nexercise “judicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness.” The problem with\nthese “approaches” is that “litigants will, of course, have no notice beforehand of which\n[“analytical approach”] will be employed, for the justices themselves will not know this\nbeforehand.” Petersen, 484 Mich at 380 (MARKMAN, J., dissenting). Under the\nconcurring justices’ “analytical approaches,”\n\n      there [would be] no consistently applied . . . process with which the judge\n      promises beforehand to comply. He or she may promise to be “fair,” and\n      he or she may seek to be fair, but there are no rules for how this fairness is\n      to be achieved. There is only the promise that the judge will address each\n      [precedent] on a case-by-case basis, using whatever [“policy\n      considerations”] he or she believes are required in that instance. And the\n      suspicion simply cannot be avoided that these varying and indeterminate\n      [“policy considerations”] may be largely a function of the outcome\n      preferred by the judge and by his or her personal attitudes toward the\n      parties and their causes. Any [pertinent “policy considerations”] will be\n      identified only after the fact, and these [“policy considerations”] may or\n      may not have been invoked in resolving yesterday’s dispute, and may or\n      may not be employed in resolving tomorrow’s dispute. Any judge can\n      concoct an after-the-fact rationale for a decision; the judicial process,\n      however, is predicated upon before-the-fact rationales. An ad hoc process\n      is not a judicial process at all. In the place of predetermined rules . . .

It has been repeatedly recognized that\n\nbecause of the mandatory nature of no-fault insurance, the Legislature intended that it be\n\naffordable.11 The lead opinion gives little heed to the fact that its decision will once\n\n\nAlthough Justice WEAVER is correct that “[t]here are many factors to consider in deciding\nwhether or not to overrule precedent,” and Justice HATHAWAY is equally correct that the\napplication of stare decisis must take place on a “case-by-case basis,” this does not\nobviate the need to at least reasonably attempt to apprise the parties, and the citizens of\nthis state, before the fact what these factors might be, as this Court did in Robinson and as\nthe Chief Justice and Justice CAVANAGH did in Petersen. And whatever else can be\nunderstood of Justice HATHAWAY’s and Justice WEAVER’s “approaches” to stare decisis,\nthe application of these “approaches” has resulted in 13 precedents of this Court being\noverruled during this term alone and 6 other precedents being teed up for possible\noverruling during the next term, doubtless a record pace for dismantling the caselaw of\nthis state.\n       11\n          See, e.g., Tebo v Havlik, 418 Mich 350, 366; 343 NW2d 181 (1984) (opinion by\nBRICKLEY, J.) (recognizing that a primary goal of the no-fault act is to “provid[e] an\nequitable and prompt method of redressing injuries in a way which made the mandatory\ninsurance coverage affordable to all motorists”); Celina Mut Ins Co v Lake States Ins Co,\n452 Mich 84, 89; 549 NW2d 834 (1996) (holding that “the no-fault insurance system . . .\nis designed to provide victims with assured, adequate, and prompt reparations at the\nlowest cost to both the individuals and the no-fault system”); O’Donnell v State Farm\nMut Auto Ins Co, 404 Mich 524, 547; 273 NW2d 829 (1979) (recognizing that the\nLegislature has provided for setoffs in the no-fault act and stating that “[b]ecause the\nfirst-party insurance proposed by the act was to be compulsory, it was important that the\npremiums to be charged by the insurance companies be maintained as low as possible[;]\n[o]therwise, the poor and the disadvantaged people of the state might not be able to\nobtain the necessary insurance”).\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\fagain raise the premiums of all insured drivers in this state.12\n\n       The majority also asserts that because “MCL 600.5821(4) lists the costs [for which\n\nrecovery may be sought] as those for the ‘maintenance, care, and treatment of persons in\n\nhospitals, homes, schools, and other state institutions,’” it “supersedes all limitations in\n\nMCL 500.3145(1), including the one-year-back rule’s limitation on the period of\n\nrecovery.” In other words, the majority contends that MCL 600.5821(4) provides an\n\nabsolute right to recover the enumerated costs.          The problem with this argument,\n\nhowever, is that the statute says no such thing. The statute does not say that there is an\n\nunfettered right to recover the enumerated costs. Instead, MCL 600.5821(4) says only\n\nthat “[a]ctions brought . . . for the recovery of the [enumerated] cost[s] . . . are not subject\n\nto the statute of limitations and may be brought at any time without limitation, the\n\nprovisions of any statute notwithstanding.” That is, the reference to “the recovery of the\n\ncost[s]” is in the context of describing what types of actions are not subject to the statute\n\nof limitations-- those “[a]ctions brought . . . for the recovery of the [enumerated]\n\ncost[s] . . . .” Nowhere within the statute is there any indication that the Legislature\n\nintended to preclude any and all limitations on the amounts of money the state and its\n\n       12\n          Indeed, defendant Titan Insurance Company argued that overruling Cameron\nwould have “devastating affects” on the orderly adjustment of no-fault claims and\n“threaten the viability” of the Michigan Assigned Claims Facility and the Michigan\nCatastrophic Claims Association because nullifying the one-year back rule will lead to a\nflood of decades-old no-fault claims seeking expensive family attendant care benefits.\nFor a more thorough discussion of the stakes of undoing the compromise embodied in the\nno-fault act, see my dissent in McCormick, __ Mich at __. See also United States\nFidelity Ins & Guaranty Co v Mich Catastrophic Claims Ass’n, 484 Mich 1; 773 NW2d\n243 (2009) (YOUNG, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fpolitical subdivisions can recover. Instead, because MCL 600.5821(4) only pertains to\n\nwhen an action may be brought, it “is irrelevant to the damages-limiting one-year-back\n\nprovision of MCL 500.3145(1).” Cameron, 476 Mich at 62.\n\n       Plaintiffs also argue that Liptow was inconsistent with Univ of Mich Regents v\n\nState Farm Mut Ins Co, 250 Mich App 719; 650 NW2d 129 (2002), in which the Court of\n\nAppeals held that MCL 600.5821(4) in the RJA, exempts the state and its political\n\nsubdivisions from the no-fault act’s statute of limitations in MCL 500.3145(1).\n\nSpecifically, the Court held:\n\n              The language of the statute clearly indicates that the Legislature\n       intended to exempt the state and its political subdivisions from all statutes\n       of limitation. Thus, [MCL 600.5821(4)] exempts plaintiff from the statute\n       of limitations contained in [MCL 500.3145(1)]. [Id. at 733 (emphasis\n       added).]\n\nHowever, as the Court of Appeals explained in Univ of Mich Regents v Auto Club Ins\n\nAss’n, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 12, 2009\n\n(Docket No. 281917):\n\n               [T]he decision in Univ of Michigan Regents concerned “statutes of\n       limitation,” not “the damages-limiting portion of MCL 500.3145(1), the\n       one-year back rule.” Consequently, there is no conflict between Univ of\n       Michigan Regents and Liptow.[13]\n\nAs this Court has explained, “MCL 500.3145(1) contains two limitations on the time for\n\ncommencing an action and one limitation on the period for which benefits may be\n\nrecovered[.]” Cameron, 476 Mich at 61, citing Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 473\n       13\n          An application for leave to appeal in Univ of Mich Regents v Auto Club Ins\nAss’n is currently being held in abeyance pending the decision in this case. Univ of Mich\nRegents v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 774 NW2d 906 (Mich, 2009).\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fMich 562, 574; 702 NW2d 539 (2005). First, “an action for PIP benefits must be\n\ncommenced within a year of the accident unless the insured gives written notice of injury\n\nor previously received PIP benefits from the insurer.”        Cameron, 476 Mich at 61.\n\nSecond, “[i]f notice was given or payment was made, the action can be commenced\n\nwithin one year of the most recent loss.” Id. Third, under the one-year-back rule,\n\n“[r]ecovery . . . is limited to losses incurred during the year before the filing of the\n\naction.” Id. Univ of Mich Regents v State Farm concerned the statute of limitations\n\nportion of MCL 500.3145(1), not the one-year-back rule. Therefore, there is utterly no\n\ninconsistency between Univ of Mich Regents v State Farm and Liptow.14\n\n       The Court of Appeals dissent stated, “I believe that the holding in Liptow takes an\n\nirrationally and improperly narrow view of this statute by holding that it exempts entities\n\nlike plaintiff[s] from a one-year limitation on bringing an action but not from a one-year\n\nlimitation on recovering in such an action.” Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co,\n\nunpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued June 5, 2008 (Docket No.\n\n276710) (DAVIS, P.J., dissenting) (emphasis in the original).15 Cameron involved a very\n\n\n       14\n       This conclusion is further supported by the fact that Judges FITZGERALD and\nMARKEY were in the majority on both Court of Appeals panels.\n       15\n          The lead opinion here likewise contends that Cameron and Liptow “created an\nindefensible paradox” by limiting a plaintiff to the “hollow right” of being able to bring a\ncause of action without being able to recover any damages. It also states that “Cameron’s\ninterpretation of the saving provision actually operates to extinguish a claim, not save it.”\nHowever, the lead opinion ignores that a plaintiff will only be unable to recover damages\nif that plaintiff has not suffered any losses within the year preceding the filing of the\naction. Contrary to the lead opinion’s contention, this does not make Cameron and\nLiptow “unworkable.” It just means that they work differently than the lead justices\n\n\n                                             15\n\fsimilar situation. In my concurring opinion in Cameron, I indicated that I was concerned\n\nbecause\n\n       although the tolling provision instructs minors and insane persons that they\n       are entitled to wait until one year after their legal disabilities have been\n       removed to bring their civil actions, if they do wait, they will only be\n       allowed to recover what may be a portion of the total damages incurred.\n       [Cameron, 476 Mich at 73 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]\n\nHowever, I concluded that, regardless of my concerns about the wisdom (or lack thereof)\n\nof the statute, a judge is bound to follow this language. The same remains true here.\n\nAlthough to some it may seem less than optimal to exempt entities such as plaintiffs from\n\na one-year limitation on bringing an action, but not also from a one-year limitation on\n\nrecovery in that an action, that is clearly what the Legislature has done, and it is entitled\n\nto act in a way that is viewed with disapproval by members of the judiciary.\n\n       Nor is this, assuming arguendo that such is a relevant consideration, an “absurd\n\nresult.” Even to the extent that an “absurd result” doctrine exists in Michigan,16 a result\n\n\n\nwould like them to work. Furthermore, it is not Cameron or “Cameron’s interpretation of\nthe saving provision” that prohibits a plaintiff from recovering losses incurred more than\none year before the action was filed; it is the Legislature’s adoption of the one-year-back\nrule in the no-fault act. The lead opinion also states that Cameron and Liptow are\n“unworkable” because they deny plaintiffs “the legal recourse the Legislature provided\n[them], which is . . . to recover the damages [they] incurred more than a year earlier.”\nThe problem with this assertion is that the Legislature has provided no such right.\nInstead, the Legislature has only provided certain people and entities the right to bring a\ncause of action after the period of limitations has expired. Nowhere, however, has the\nLegislature provided these same people and entities the right to recover an unlimited\namount of money in those actions.\n       16\n         Whether the “absurd result” doctrine should exist in Michigan is a matter of\nsome debate, but the Court need not address the question in this case because, as\ndiscussed, what was done here by the Legislature was not absurd. It suffices to note,\n\n\n                                             16\n\fis only “absurd” if it is “‘quite impossible that [the Legislature] could have intended the\n\nresult . . . .’” Id. at 85 n 9 (MARKMAN, J., concurring), quoting Public Citizen v United\n\nStates Dep’t of Justice, 491 US 440, 470-471; 109 S Ct 2558; 105 L Ed 2d 377 (1989)\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring). It is entirely possible that the Legislature could have intended\n\nthe result reached in Liptow. For example, the Legislature “might have intended these\n\nresults in order to make no-fault insurance more affordable.” Cameron, 476 Mich at 80\n\n(MARKMAN, J., concurring) (emphasis in the original), citing Griffith v State Farm Mut\n\nAuto Ins Co, 472 Mich 521, 539; 697 NW2d 895 (2005) (stating that this Court has\n\nalways been cognizant of the potential problem of “cost containment for this mandatory\n\ncoverage” when interpreting the no-fault act), citing Shavers v Attorney General, 402\n\nMich 554, 599; 267 NW2d 72 (1978) (holding that “[i]n choosing to make no-fault\n\ninsurance compulsory for all motorists, the Legislature has made the registration and\n\noperation of a motor vehicle inexorably dependent on whether no-fault insurance is\n\navailable at fair and equitable rates”). Conceivably, as well,\n\n       a reasonable lawmaker might have intended to maintain the solvency of\n       insurers, and to enhance their ability to undertake future planning, by\n       protecting them from multimillion dollar lawsuits filed many years after\n       medical expenses have been incurred, and only after relatively manageable\n       month-to-month expenses have been allowed to develop into more\n       extraordinary decade-to-decade expenses. [Cameron, 476 Mich at 81-82\n       (MARKMAN, J., concurring) (emphasis in the original).]\n\n\n\nhowever, that while I still subscribe to the view that the absurd result doctrine is an\nappropriate tool of statutory construction, the two justices who join this dissent do not.\nSee, e.g., People v McIntire, 461 Mich 147, 152-160; 599 NW2d 102 (1999); People v\nMcIntire, 232 Mich App 71, 122-127; 591 NW2d 231 (1998).\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fThat is,\n\n       [s]uch a lawmaker might have sought to obligate those who have incurred\n       medical expenses to seek reimbursement on a relatively ongoing basis,\n       rather than allowing them to wait for many years before seeking\n       compensation. Indeed, it is conceivable that a reasonable lawmaker might\n       have wished to incentivize earlier, rather than later, causes of action in\n       order to encourage those who have incurred medical expenses to act in a\n       manner consistent with their own financial self-interest, and to ensure that\n       their medical expenses were reimbursed expeditiously. [Id. at 82 (emphasis\n       in the original).]\n\n“Finally, a reasonable lawmaker might have concluded that practical problems pertaining\n\nto evidence and proofs in old claims required some balance between the interests of the\n\n[claimant] and those of the insurer.” Id. (emphasis in the original).\n\n       As the majority acknowledges, “if the one-year-back rule applies to [plaintiffs’]\n\nclaim, plaintiffs are entitled to no damages,” because all of their losses were “incurred\n\nmore than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced,” MCL\n\n500.3145(1). Indeed, all of plaintiffs’ losses were incurred in 2000, and yet plaintiffs\n\nwaited until 2006 to file this cause of action. Because I believe, for the reasons set forth\n\nabove, that the one-year-back rule does apply to plaintiffs’ claim, I conclude that\n\nplaintiffs’ damages are not recoverable. Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeals.\n\n       CORRIGAN and YOUNG, JJ., concurred with MARKMAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f",

Less than one\n\nyear after the accident, Morgan sought personal protection insurance benefits through the\n\nMichigan Assigned Claims Facility (MACF). Because he was not covered under a no-\n\nfault insurance policy, the MACF designated Titan Insurance Company as the servicing\n\ninsurer for his claims. In January 2006, the University of Michigan Health System and\n\nthe university’s regents filed this lawsuit against Titan, seeking payment from defendant\n\nfor Morgan’s medical treatment. Plaintiffs sought reimbursement of the full cost of\n\nMorgan’s hospitalization, which they alleged was $69,957.19.\n\n      Defendant moved for summary disposition, arguing that the one-year-back rule of\n\nMCL 500.3145(1)3 barred plaintiffs from recovering the claimed damages.

The\n\nmajority held that the minority/insanity provision in MCL 600.5851(1) did not remove\n\nthe plaintiff’s claim from application of the one-year-back rule. The analysis stated:\n\n               By its unambiguous terms, MCL 600.5851(1) concerns when a\n       minor or person suffering from insanity may “make the entry or bring the\n       action.” It does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an action has\n       been brought. MCL 600.5851(1) then is irrelevant to the damages-limiting\n       one-year-back provision of MCL 500.3145(1). Thus, to be clear, the\n       minority/insanity tolling provision in MCL 600.5851(1) does not operate to\n       toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1).[12]\n\nAccordingly, the majority held that a statute governing when a party may bring an action\n\ndoes not affect the damages recoverable under the one-year-back rule.\n\n       In Liptow, the Court of Appeals examined the interplay of the one-year-back rule\n\nand MCL 600.5821(4). Relying solely on Cameron, it stated:\n\n              Thus, the pertinent question is whether the damages-limiting portion\n       of MCL 500.3145(1), the one-year-back rule, limits the [claimant’s]\n       recovery. This Court’s ruling in Univ of Michigan Regents [v State Farm\n       Mut Ins Co, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1966909\"><a href=\"/opinion/1966909/regents-of-university-of-mi-v-state-farm-mutual-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 733; 650 NW2d 129 (2002)] is of no\n       assistance in this determination. The issue appears to be one of first\n       impression.\n\n              MCL 600.5821(4) provides that actions brought by the state or its\n       subdivisions to recover the cost of maintenance, care, and treatment of\n       persons in state institutions “are not subject to the statute of limitations and\n       may be brought at any time without limitation, the provisions of any statute\n       notwithstanding.” We conclude that, by the plain import of this language,\n       the Legislature intended to exempt the state from statutes of limitations\n       when bringing an action to recover public funds. The language refers to\n       statutes of limitations and provides that an action may be brought at any\n\n       12\n            Cameron, 476 Mich at 62.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       time. But the statute does not address damage limitation provisions or any\n       other limiting provisions. In other words, like the minority tolling\n       provision, MCL 600.5821(4) concerns the time during which the state may\n       bring an action; it “does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an\n       action has been brought.” Cameron, supra, 476 Mich at 62. Accordingly,\n       we conclude that MCL 600.5821(4), like the minority tolling provision of\n       MCL 600.5851(1), does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule of MCL\n       500.3145(1). Cameron, supra, 476 Mich at 61-62. Therefore, we hold that\n       defendant is liable to the [claimant] only for costs it incurred for [the\n       patient’s] care, maintenance, and treatment in state institutions within one\n       year before the filing of the complaint.[13]\n\n                                         ANALYSIS\n\n       This case presents questions of statutory interpretation which are reviewed de\n\nnovo.14\n\n       No party disputes that MCL 600.5821(4) preserves plaintiffs’ right to bring the\n\ninstant cause of action. The question before us is whether MCL 500.3145(1) restricts\n\nplaintiffs’ recovery to damages incurred one year before plaintiffs filed suit. The answer\n\nturns on the correct understanding of the interaction between MCL 500.3145(1) and\n\nMCL 600.5821(4). It is undisputed that all of plaintiffs’ costs were incurred between\n\nMarch 18 and March 23, 2000. Thus, if the one-year-back rule applies to their claim,\n\nplaintiffs are entitled to no damages.\n\n       Defendant relies on Liptow, which held that the one-year-back rule governs\n\nactions to which MCL 600.5821(4) applies because the statute does not exempt state\n\nentities from its limitation on damages. We disagree.\n       13\n            Liptow, 272 Mich App at 555-556.\n       14\n            Dep’t of Agriculture v Appletree Mktg, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"831906\"><a href=\"/opinion/831906/dept-of-agriculture-v-appletree-marketing/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7; 779 NW2d 237\n(2010).\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f       Defendant’s argument and the holding in Liptow rest on a fundamentally incorrect\n\npremise. Liptow reasoned that (1) MCL 600.5821(4) exempts state entities from any\n\nstatute of limitations, (2) the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1) is not a statute of\n\nlimitations, but a damages limitation, and therefore (3) MCL 600.5821(4) does not\n\nexempt a governmental entity from the one-year-back-rule of MCL 500.3145(1).15 This\n\npremise is derived from our decision in Cameron. Therefore, we are required to revisit\n\nCameron’s analysis.\n\n       The Cameron majority concluded that actions brought pursuant to MCL\n\n600.5851(1) are subject to the one-year-back rule because that statute does not implicate\n\nwhen a plaintiff may “bring an action.” We conclude that the statutory language in MCL\n\n600.5851(1) and MCL 500.3145(1) does not command the conclusion that the Cameron\n\nmajority reached.\n\n       To begin with, we conclude that the approach in Cameron was flawed because it\n\nread the statutory language in isolation. MCL 600.5851(1) does not create its own\n\nindependent cause of action. It must be read together with the statute under which the\n\nplaintiff seeks to recover. In no-fault cases, for example, MCL 600.5851(1) must be read\n\ntogether with MCL 500.3145(1). Doing so, the statutes grant infants and incompetent\n\npersons one year after their disability is removed to “bring the action” “for recovery of\n\npersonal protection insurance benefits . . . for accidental bodily injury . . . .” On the basis\n\n\n\n       15\n            See Cameron, 476 Mich at 62.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fof its language, MCL 600.5851(1) supersedes all limitations in MCL 500.3145(1),\n\nincluding the one-year-back rule’s limitation on the period of recovery.16\n\n       For what purpose might a plaintiff “bring an action”? Surely not for the sole\n\nsatisfaction of filing papers in court. A plaintiff brings a tort action to recover damages.\n\nAlthough the right to bring an action would be a hollow one indeed if a plaintiff could not\n\nrecover damages, Cameron and Liptow limited a plaintiff to just that hollow right.\n\nTherefore, we restore the proper understanding of the interaction between MCL\n\n600.5851(1) and the one-year-back rule.          We hold that the “action” and “claim”\n\npreserved by MCL 600.5851(1) include the right to collect damages.              As Justice\n\nCAVANAGH explained in his dissenting opinion in Cameron,\n\n       [t]he word “claim” has been discussed by this Court many times over the\n       past century. For instance, in Allen v Bd of State Auditors, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">;\n       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1899), this Court noted the following definition of the word\n       “claim”: “‘[A] demand of a right or alleged right; a calling on another for\n       something due or asserted to be due; as, a claim of wages for services.’” Id.\n       at 328, citing Cent Dict.

The aggregate of operative facts giving rise to a right enforceable\n       by a court . . . . 2. The assertion of an existing right; any right to payment\n\n       16\n          Therefore, we also do not agree with Justice MARKMAN’s criticism that we\n“discern the purpose of the statute from something other than its actual language . . . .”\nPost at ___.\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f         or to an equitable remedy, even if contingent or provisional . . . . 3. A\n         demand for money or property to which one asserts a right . . . . [Black’s\n         Law Dictionary (7th ed).]”\n\n                 In short, then, a claim means a “demand[] of a pecuniary nature,” a\n         “right to payment,” and a “demand for money.”[17]\n\n         Justice CAVANAGH’s dissent is equally applicable here. The statute at issue in this\n\ncase, MCL 600.5821(4), also addresses “[a]ctions.” Specifically, it preserves actions\n\nbrought by state entities. It also explicitly delineates that the action contemplated is one\n\nbrought for the recovery for certain costs incurred. MCL 600.5821(4) lists the costs as\n\nthose for the “maintenance, care, and treatment of persons in hospitals, homes, schools,\n\nand other state institutions . . . .” Thus, it is apparent from the language of the statute that\n\nthe Legislature intended to preserve more than the state entities’ right to file papers in\n\ncourt.\n\n         Moreover, this Court’s caselaw predating Cameron also does not support the\n\nCameron majority’s holding. The only authority cited for Cameron’s interpretation was\n\nin Justice MARKMAN’s concurring opinion, which relied on dicta from Justice\n\nBRICKLEY’s lead opinion in Howard v Gen Motors Corp.18\n\n\n         17\n              Cameron, 476 Mich at 100 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).\n         </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span>\n        <span class=\"reporter\">Howard</span> <span class=\"page\">v</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Gen Motors Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1808616\"><a href=\"/opinion/1808616/howard-v-general-motors-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 399 NW2d 10 (1986). Only Justice\nRILEY concurred in Justice BRICKLEY’s opinion.\n\n        We take no issue with Justice MARKMAN’s argument that the Cameron majority\nneeded no “authority” to support its holding other than “the language of the statute\nitself.” Post at ___. But he wrongly claims that this opinion “fails to apprehend” the\nprinciple of statutory interpretation that the actual language of the statutes is the best\nindicator of legislative intent. Post at ___. To the contrary, we conclude that the\n\n\n                                               9\n\f       In Howard, two justices analyzed the one-year-back rule in the workers’\n\ncompensation act to determine whether it was a jurisdictional affirmative defense akin to\n\na statute of limitations. Justice BRICKLEY concluded that “the ‘statute of limitations’\n\ninterpretation of the one-year-back rule offered in Kleinschrodt[19] and applied to the two-\n\nyear-back rule in Kingery[20] and Howard [in the Court of Appeals] contradicts our earlier\n\nprecedent on the subject as well as the plain language of the statutes.”21 By contrast, in\n\nKleinschrodt, five justices stated that “[w]e are of the opinion that the one-year-back\n\nprovision is a defense, akin to the statute of limitations . . . .”22\n\n       In sum, for more than 20 years before Cameron, the majority in all of the Court’s\n\nrelevant opinions saw no basis for treating any of the provisions of MCL 500.3145(1)\n\ndifferently. In Welton v Carriers Ins Co, we made a distinction among the provisions\n\nonly to the extent of noting that the section contains “two limitations on time of suit and\n\none limitation on period of recovery[.]”23 Even then, the Welton Court saw no basis for\n\n\n\n\nstatutory language does not compel the interpretation reached by the Cameron majority.\nSee pages 7-10 of this opinion.

We also hold that this\n\nunderstanding of the interaction between the statutes is equally applicable to the\n\ninteraction between MCL 600.5821(4) and MCL 500.3145(1). Therefore, the provisions\n\nof MCL 600.5821(4) preserving a plaintiff’s right to bring an action also preserve the\n\nplaintiff’s right to recover damages incurred more than one year before suit is filed.

See, e.g., post at __ (WEAVER, J., concurring); post\nat __ (HATHAWAY, J., concurring); Robinson v Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 464; 613 NW2d\n307 (2000).\n\n        I believe that our thoughtful and lengthy treatments of whether Cameron is\nentitled to stare decisis respect belie Justice YOUNG’s criticism that “today precedent is\nno longer an ‘issue.’” Post at ___. Justice YOUNG disdains our positions of the last\ndecade regarding stare decisis as nothing but a “decade-long shrill pretense . . . .” Post at\n___. But he is incorrect. Not only have our positions been put forth without vitriol and\nad hominem innuendos, there has been no pretense about them.\n\n       Nor do we simply ignore precedent with which we disagree, as Justice YOUNG\nonce again asserts. It appears that he intends to repeat himself using an identical attack in\neach and every case in which I vote for a different result than he does. See, e.g.,\nEsselman v Garden City Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">892</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010). But with each repetition, his\nclaims grow less believable.\n\n       Finally, Justice YOUNG again quotes a statement I made two years ago and applies\nit in an altogether different context to impugn my motives for voting as I have in this\ncase. But he has no wisdom concerning my motives, nor do I claim any concerning his.\nHis attack has no proper place in a judicial opinion.\n       28\n          We are at a loss to understand Justice MARKMAN’s argument that we deem it\n“appropriate” to overrule Cameron because Cameron overruled Geiger. Post at ___,\n___. To be clear, we conclude that it is appropriate to overrule Cameron because it was\nwrongly decided and stare decisis considerations do not support retaining it. Thus,\nweighing the merits of overruling Cameron vis-à-vis overruling Geiger, an analysis that\nhis dissent engages in, post at ___, is not necessary to our analysis. He also claims that\nour decision to overrule Cameron makes the caselaw of our state less consistent with the\nintentions of the Legislature. Post at ___. In most disputes that come before this Court,\nincluding this one, the validity of such a claim is undoubtedly in the eye of the beholder.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fcourse of action.29 That presumption should be retained until effectively rebutted by the\n\nconclusion that a compelling justification exists to overturn it.30 Nonetheless, when\n\nanalyzing precedent that itself represents a recent departure from established caselaw, we\n\napply a decreased presumption in favor of upholding precedent.31\n\n       In determining whether a compelling justification exists to overturn precedent, the\n\nCourt may consider numerous evaluative criteria, none of which, standing alone, is\n\ndispositive. Historically, courts have considered (1) whether the precedent has proved to\n\nbe intolerable because it defies practical workability, (2) whether reliance on it is such\n\nthat overruling it would cause a special hardship and inequity, (3) whether related\n\nprinciples of law have so far developed since the precedent was pronounced that no more\n\nthan a remnant of it has survived, (4) whether facts and circumstances have so changed,\n\nor come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the precedent of significant\n\napplication or justification, (5) whether other jurisdictions have decided similar issues in\n\na different manner, (6) whether upholding the precedent is likely to result in serious\n\ndetriment prejudicial to public interests, and (7) whether the prior decision was an abrupt\n\nand largely unexplained departure from then existing precedent.\n\n\n\n\n       29\n        Petersen v Magna Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836195\"><a href=\"/opinion/836195/petersen-v-magna-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 317; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (opinion by\nKELLY, C.J.).\n       30\n            Id.\n       31\n        Adarand Constructors, Inc v Pena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 233-234; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nor is there a magic\n\nnumber of factors that must favor overruling a case in order to establish the requisite\n\ncompelling justification. Rather, this conclusion should be reached on a case-by-case\n\nbasis.\n\n         Here, we first consider whether Cameron has proved intolerable because it defies\n\npractical workability. Indeed it does. Cameron left MCL 600.5851(1) and similar\n\nprovisions void of effect in many cases while ostensibly protecting an injured party’s\n\nright to file suit. This created an indefensible paradox and, as such, an unworkable and\n\nconfusing legal landscape. Consider, for example, the hypothetical case of a boy injured\n\nin a car accident at age 12 and fully recovered by age 15. Upon reaching 18, he retains\n\nan attorney to file suit to recover the costs associated with the treatment of his injuries,\n\nrelying on MCL 600.5851(1). The defendant also retains counsel, who responds by filing\n\na motion to dismiss, arguing that none of the plaintiff’s damages are recoverable. The\n\ntrial court parses the parties’ filings and determines that none of the plaintiff’s costs were\n\nincurred in the year before suit was filed.\n\n         Under Cameron, the plaintiff in this hypothetical case was indisputably entitled to\n\nfile suit, because MCL 600.5851(1) preserved his right to do so. Yet Cameron gutted his\n\nsuit of any practical worth because, under its interpretation of MCL 600.5851(1), the\n\nplaintiff had no chance to recover any damages. Thus, the plaintiff was denied the legal\n\nrecourse the Legislature provided him, which is, after reaching his majority, to recover\n\nthe damages he incurred more than a year earlier.          Accordingly, we conclude that\n\nCameron is frequently innately unworkable.\n\n\n                                              14\n\f       Second, we consider whether reliance interests weigh in favor of overruling\n\nCameron. We conclude that they do. Cameron is of recent vintage, having been decided\n\na mere four years ago. Hence, reliance on its holding has been of limited duration.\n\nMoreover, Cameron represented a sea change in one area of the law and toppled settled\n\ninterpretations of the no-fault act that had existed almost since the adoption of MCL\n\n600.5851.32 In doing so, Cameron disrupted the reliance interests of the injured minors\n\nand the incompetents who relied on its provisions to preserve their claims until removal\n\nof their disabilities.\n\n       We recognize that there exists a competing reliance interest in the continuing\n\nvalidity of Cameron: that of the defendants in no-fault cases.              Yet Cameron’s\n\nevisceration of the crux of a plaintiff’s claim—the potential to recover damages—\n\neffectively removed altogether the incentive to file suit as permitted by MCL\n\n600.5851(1). We conclude that, while no-fault defendants’ reliance on this interpretation\n\nis reasonable, it is not itself sufficient to preclude overruling Cameron given the extent of\n\nCameron’s prejudice to no-fault plaintiffs.\n\n       Third, we consider whether related principles of law have developed since\n\nCameron’s interpretation of MCL 600.5851(1) was pronounced.                  This factor is\n\ninapplicable to our stare decisis analysis in this case, as we are aware of no intervening\n\nchange in the law that further supports or undermines Cameron’s continuing legitimacy.\n\n\n\n       32\n            See n 35 of this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f       Fourth, we examine whether facts and circumstances have so changed, or have\n\ncome to be seen so differently, that Cameron has been robbed of significant justification.\n\nLike the previous factor, we discern no factual or circumstantial changes that counsel for\n\nor against overruling Cameron. Therefore, this factor also is inapplicable to our analysis.\n\n       Fifth, we consider whether other jurisdictions have decided similar issues in a\n\ndifferent manner.        This factor is likewise inapplicable to our stare decisis analysis.\n\nMichigan’s comprehensive no-fault insurance scheme is unique to our state. While other\n\nstates share the fundamental underpinnings of our system, judicial interpretations of the\n\nno-fault act have evolved independently of those of other states with similar insurance\n\nschemes. Thus, other jurisdictions’ interpretations of similar statutes are unhelpful to our\n\nanalysis in this case.\n\n       Sixth, we examine whether upholding Cameron is likely to result in serious\n\ndetriment prejudicial to public interests. We conclude that this factor weighs heavily in\n\nfavor of overruling Cameron. Cameron drastically curtailed the protection provided by\n\nthe Legislature for minors and incompetents.           In enacting MCL 600.5851(1), the\n\nLegislature conveyed its intention to protect individuals in those groups with unique\n\ntreatment under the law. The statute represents the culmination of the Legislature’s\n\ndeliberative process. Cameron undermined the Legislature’s decision to provide a “year\n\nof grace” to infants and incompetents in recognition of their inability to legally act until\n\ntheir disabilities are removed.33\n\n       33\n            See Cameron, 476 Mich at 97 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f       Moreover, Cameron set an ironic trap for minors and incompetents. As Justice\n\nCAVANAGH astutely noted in dissent:\n\n              [I]f a person is injured in a motor vehicle accident while an infant or\n       legally incompetent, and his injuries resolve a year or more before his\n       disability resolves, then [Cameron’s] interpretation of MCL 500.3145(1)\n       will completely preclude that person from recovering any of the damages\n       incurred from the accident, and, thus completely abrogate his claim.[34]\n\nThus, what the Legislature intended as a provision to preserve a plaintiff’s claims,\n\nCameron rendered largely meaningless.             In certain circumstances, Cameron’s\n\ninterpretation of the saving provision actually operates to extinguish a claim, not save it.\n\n       Finally, we consider whether Cameron represented an abrupt and largely\n\nunexplained departure from precedent. We conclude that this factor also weighs heavily\n\nin favor of overruling Cameron. Cameron overruled Geiger,35 a Court of Appeals case\n\ninterpreting the interplay between the saving provision and the no-fault act. Geiger was\n\n\n\n\n        Moreover, Justice MARKMAN is certainly correct that there is a general public\ninterest in keeping no-fault insurance affordable. However, preserving claims brought by\na group specifically protected by the Legislature—minors, incompetents, or state\nentities—is particularly compelling, given that the Legislature singled out these groups\nfor disparate treatment.\n       34\n            Id. at 93 n 6.\n       35\n         Geiger cited Rawlins for the proposition that MCL 600.5851 applied to the one-\nyear period of limitations in MCL 500.3145(1). Thus, the underlying analytical support\nfor Geiger dates back 27 years.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fdecided in 1982 and stood as the seminal interpretation of the one-year-back rule until\n\nCameron unexpectedly swept it aside 24 years later.36\n\n       Furthermore, as noted, a majority of this Court had concluded before Cameron\n\nthat the one-year-back rule does not apply to claims preserved by tolling. We made this\n\ndecision even though in Welton we described the provisions of MCL 500.3145(1) as “two\n\nlimitations on time of suit and one limitation on period of recovery[.]”37 To the extent\n\nthat Cameron held otherwise, it also implicitly overruled Welton. Thus, we are firmly\n\nconvinced that Cameron represented an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from\n\nprecedent.\n\n       In summary, Cameron is often unworkable, has not engendered valid reliance\n\ninterests, has caused serious detriment prejudicial to public interests, and represented an\n\nabrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent. Accordingly, we conclude that\n\na compelling justification exists for overruling it.38\n\n\n\n\n       36\n          Given that our decision does nothing more than restore the law to its pre-2006\nstate, we find defendant’s assertion that overruling Cameron will have “devastating\neffects” highly questionable.\n       37\n            Welton, 421 Mich at 576.\n       38\n         Justice MARKMAN is correct that a majority of this Court has overruled several\nprecedents this term. But it is an overstatement for his dissent to characterize this as a\nmass or flood of overrulings. Post at ___. This is particularly true given that almost\nevery case overruled this term is one in which the former majority departed from settled\njurisprudence to establish a new rule of law.\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\f                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       We overrule our decision in Cameron and the Court of Appeals’ decision in\n\nLiptow. Entities listed in MCL 600.5821(4) may bring an action and recover costs\n\nnotwithstanding the limiting provisions of MCL 500.3145(1), including the one-year-\n\nback rule. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case and\n\nremand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n       CAVANAGH, WEAVER (except for the part entitled “Stare Decisis”), and\n\nHATHAWAY, JJ., concurred with KELLY, C.J.\n\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f                              STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                     SUPREME COURT\n\n\nREGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN and UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN HEALTH SYSTEM,\n\n                Plaintiffs-Appellants,\n\nv                                                           No. 136905\n\nTITAN INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n                Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\nWEAVER, J. (concurring).\n\n       I concur in and sign all of the majority opinion except the section entitled “Stare\n\nDecisis.” I write separately to note that in addition to the reasons given in the majority\n\nopinion, I also believe that Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"845744\"><a href=\"/opinion/845744/cameron-v-auto-club-ins-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 718 NW2d 784\n\n(2006), should be overruled for the reasons in my dissent to the Cameron decision. Id. at\n\n104.\n\n       In Cameron, the majority failed to give proper effect to the language contained in\n\nMCL 500.3145(1).1 As I noted in my Cameron dissent, the “one-year-back rule” is not a\n\n\n       1\n           MCL 500.3145(1) states:\n\n              An action for recovery of personal protection insurance benefits\n       payable under this chapter for accidental bodily injury may not be\n       commenced later than 1 year after the date of the accident causing the\n       injury unless written notice of injury as provided herein has been given to\n       the insurer within 1 year after the accident or unless the insurer has\n\fperiod of limitations as interpreted by the majority. Id. at 106. Rather, the “one-year-\n\nback rule” is part of the statute that details how to apply the tolling provision contained in\n\nthe period of limitations laid out in the first sentence of MCL 500.3145(1). Id. at 106-\n\n107. By holding that the one-year-back rule was a period of limitations, the Cameron\n\nmajority failed to “give meaning to the actual text of the statute.” Id. at 108.\n\n       In addition to the lack of restraint of the Cameron majority’s use of the judicial\n\npower of interpretation, Chief Justice KELLY’s majority opinion in this case shows that\n\nthe Cameron majority failed to exercise common sense and fairness. As noted in Chief\n\nJustice KELLY’s majority opinion in this case, Cameron resulted in the Legislature’s\n\nsavings provisions regarding minors and government entities becoming hollow rights\n\nwhen injuries occurred more than a year before a lawsuit was filed.\n\n       On the subject of stare decisis, Justice YOUNG’s dissent in this case attempts to\n\ndeceive the public. It attempts to lump together the four justices who agree with parts of\n\nthe majority opinion into having had some sort of previously stated fidelity to stare\n\ndecisis that those justices have abandoned since former Chief Justice TAYLOR’s\n\noverwhelming defeat in the 2008 election.\n\n\n\n\n       previously made a payment of personal protection insurance benefits for the\n       injury. If the notice has been given or a payment has been made, the action\n       may be commenced at any time within 1 year after the most recent\n       allowable expense, work loss or survivor's loss has been incurred.\n       However, the claimant may not recover benefits for any portion of the loss\n       incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was\n       commenced.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       Justice YOUNG’s dissent quotes various past statements, made by those justices\n\nsigning portions of the majority opinion, regarding stare decisis and criticizing the former\n\n“majority of four” (former Chief Justice TAYLOR and Justices CORRIGAN, YOUNG, and\n\nMARKMAN). With respect to myself, the dissent quotes a statement I made in response to\n\nthe improper and unfair dismantling of decades of longstanding insurance contract law by\n\nthe former “majority of four” in Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848613\"><a href=\"/opinion/848613/devillers-v-auto-club-ins-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 702\n\nNW2d 539 (2005). In Devillers, I stated, “Correction for correction’s sake does not make\n\nsense. The case has not been made why the Court should not adhere to the doctrine of\n\nstare decisis in this case.” Id. at 622 (WEAVER, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).\n\n       Justice YOUNG’s dissent uses my Devillers statement in what appears to be an\n\nattempt to try to get people to believe that I have somehow changed my view of stare\n\ndecisis since former Chief Justice TAYLOR was defeated.          The dissent’s misleading\n\nassertions are simply incorrect.\n\n       My Devillers statement itself shows that I was criticizing the disregard for stare\n\ndecisis in that specific case. My Devillers statement is an example of my service to the\n\nrule of law and a partial expression of my view of the policy of stare decisis, which is that\n\npast precedent should generally be followed but that, in deciding whether wrongly\n\ndecided precedent should be overruled, each case should be looked at individually on its\n\nfacts and merits through the lens of judicial restraint, common sense, and fairness.\n\n       Justice YOUNG’s dissent cannot point to a statement where I professed some sort\n\nof position regarding stare decisis as an immutable doctrine because I have not taken that\n\nposition and therefore have made no such statements. Justice YOUNG’s various dissents\n\n\n                                             3\n\fcontinue to mischaracterize my positions by making inaccurate statements, using partial\n\nquotes taken out of context, and omitting relevant information in an apparent attempt to\n\ndeceive readers.2\n\n       I agree with the sentiment recently expressed by Chief Justice Roberts of the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court in his concurrence to the decision in Citizens United v Fed\n\nElection Comm, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">___, ___; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

I chose not to sign Chief Justice KELLY’s lead opinion in Petersen v\n\nMagna Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836195\"><a href=\"/opinion/836195/petersen-v-magna-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316-320; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), because it proposed to\n\ncreate a standardized test for stare decisis. Likewise, I do not sign the majority opinion’s\n\nstare decisis section in this case because it applies Petersen. There is no need for this\n\nCourt to adopt any standardized test regarding stare decisis. In fact, it is an impossible\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         It appears that Justice YOUNG does not agree with Chief Justice Roberts. In\nJustice YOUNG’s dissent, he lists 12 cases that have been overruled by this Court in the\npast 18 months. While Justice YOUNG may feel aggrieved by this Court overruling those\n12 cases, amongst those cases were some of the most egregious examples of judicial\nactivism that did great harm to the people of Michigan. Those decisions were made by\nthe “majority of four,” including Justice YOUNG, under the guise of ideologies such as\n“textualism” and “judicial traditionalism.” Justice YOUNG’s apparent contempt for the\ncommon law and common sense can be seen in his 2004 article in the Texas Review of\nLaw and Politics, where Justice YOUNG stated:\n\n             Consequently, I want to focus my remarks here on the\n       embarrassment that the common law presents—or ought to present—to a\n       conscientious judicial traditionalist. . . .\n\n              To give a graphic illustration of my feelings on the subject, I tend to\n       think of the common law as a drunken, toothless ancient relative, sprawled\n       prominently and in a state of nature on a settee in the middle of one’s\n       genteel garden party. Grandpa’s presence is undoubtedly a cause of\n       mortification to the host. But since only the most ill-bred of guests would\n       be coarse enough to comment on Grandpa’s presence and condition, all\n       concerned simply try ignore him. [Young, A judicial traditionalist\n       confronts the common law, 8 Texas Rev L & Pol 299, 301-302 (2004).]\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\ftask. There are many factors to consider when deciding whether or not to overrule\n\nprecedent, and the importance of such factors often changes on a case-by-case basis.4\n\n       In the end, the consideration of stare decisis and whether to overrule wrongly\n\ndecided precedent always includes service to the rule of law through an application and\n\nexercise of judicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness—justice for all.\n\n       In serving the rule of law and applying judicial restraint, common sense, and a\n\nsense of fairness to the case at hand, I agree with and join the majority opinion’s holding\n\nthat Cameron is overruled.\n\n\n                                                        Elizabeth A. Weaver\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          Over the past decade, the principal tool used by this Court to decide when a\nprecedent should be overruled is the set of guidelines that was laid out in Robinson v\nDetroit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 463; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), an opinion written by former Justice\nTAYLOR that Justices CORRIGAN, YOUNG, MARKMAN, and I signed, and that I have used\nnumerous times. By no means do I consider the Robinson guidelines a “be-all, end-all\ntest” that constitutes precedent of this Court to be used whenever this Court considers\noverruling precedent. I view Robinson as merely providing guidelines to assist this Court\nin its legal analysis when pertinent. I note that my position in Devillers is in no way\ninconsistent with my position on stare decisis in this case, nor is it inconsistent with any\nposition on stare decisis that I have taken in other cases, such as Robinson. Devillers\ninvolved the “majority of four” overruling precedent involving contract interpretation\nfrom a case that was nearly twenty (20) years old. In my Devillers dissent, I noted that I\nagreed with the majority’s interpretation that the old precedent was incorrect, but given\nthe passage of time since that specific precedent was decided, the Court should not\ndisturb that longstanding precedent because the law had become so ingrained that to\noverrule it would harm the reliance interests of parties in insurance cases. My position in\nDevillers was entirely consistent with the reliance prong of the Robinson guidelines. My\nposition in the instant case is also consistent with the reliance prong of the Robinson\nguidelines since Cameron, the case which is now being overruled, was only decided four\n(4) years ago.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f                               STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                      SUPREME COURT\n\n\nREGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN and UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN HEALTH SYSTEM,\n\n                 Plaintiffs-Appellants,\n\nv                                                         No. 136905\n\nTITAN INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n                 Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\nHATHAWAY, J.

I also fully concur with Justice WEAVER’s stare decisis analysis in her\n\nconcurring opinion. I write separately to express my own thoughts on the doctrine of\n\nstare decisis.\n\n       Given the debate amongst the justices of this Court concerning what constitutes\n\nthe proper stare decisis analysis, I find it insightful to review how our United States\n\nSupreme Court has treated the doctrine.     Stare decisis is a principle of policy that\n\ncommands judicial respect for a court’s earlier decisions and the rules of law that they\n\nembody.

Most importantly, the critical analysis should be on the rationale regarding\n\nwhether or not to change precedent.\n\n       It is also worthy to note that not only has the United States Supreme Court\n\nhistorically not taken one single approach to the application of stare decisis, the Court has\n\nnot felt compelled to discuss stare decisis in all cases when precedent is being overturned.\n\nMany landmark cases that overruled well-established precedent did not discuss or even\n\nmention the phrase “stare decisis.” For example, Brown overruled Plessy, thereby ending\n\nsegregation in our public schools, without mentioning the phrase “stare decisis,” much\n\nless articulating and following a particularized test.

However, the factors used in any of these tests may or may not be\napplicable in any given case.\n       6\n         See Supreme Court Decisions Overruled By Subsequent Decisions, available at\n<http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/048.pdf> (accessed July 28, 2010), for\na partial list of United States Supreme Court cases (covering the period from 1810 to\n2001) that overrule precedent.

They are manifestly incorrect. To be clear, my remark reflected my desire to\n\n“undo . . . the damage” done to the good reputation of this Court as an institution during\n\nthe former majority’s tenure.2 My only “agenda” was and is to restore nationwide respect\n\nto this Court and to chart a new course of civility.3 Of course, I do not control Justice\n\nYOUNG’s pen. His dissenting opinion demonstrates that my efforts in the area of civility\n\nhave not yet been as successful as I hoped.\n\n      Written opinions serve an important function in the judicial process: they provide\n\na forum in which the majority and dissenting justices debate the legal issues raised in\n\ncases. Sometimes that debate focuses on a narrow question. Other times, the debate\n\n\n\n      2\n        See Liptak, Unfettered Debate Takes Unflattering Turn in Michigan Supreme\nCourt, NY Times, January 19, 2007, available at <http://www.nytimes.com/2007/\n01/19/us/19michigan.html?_r=1> (accessed July 28, 2010).\n      3\n         I do not find it “disquieting” that Justice YOUNG quotes my remark. Rather, I\nfind it disquieting that Justices YOUNG and CORRIGAN conclude in a legal opinion that\nthe remark was made with a “dreadful,” “disquieting,” and “scurrilous” intent.\n\n       In regard to the quoted portion of my statement referring to my pledge to not sleep\non the bench, Justice YOUNG does not tell the whole story. The day after I was elected\nChief Justice, I was specifically asked if I had been referring to former Chief Justice\nTAYLOR in my statement. As the Detroit Free Press explained:\n\n             Outside the hearing, Kelly pledged to seek common ground with her\n      colleagues and said her comment about the sleeping on the bench was\n      metaphorical, not meant as an endorsement of the Democratic Party ad\n      attacking Taylor. She said she had not seen him sleeping during the case\n      the ad cited. [Dawson Bell, Statewide: After 10 Years of the GOP, Dem to\n      Lead High Court, Detroit Free Press, January 9, 2009, at 3B.]\n\nAs I indicated then, I will not engage in character assassinations of my current or former\ncolleagues.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fextends to broader legal questions with wider implications, such as the doctrine of stare\n\ndecisis, a particularly controversial matter.\n\n        It is no secret that the philosophical divisions among the justices on this Court are\n\ndeep.       For some years now, our disagreements on legal questions have erupted in\n\noccasionally heated and unpleasant personal recriminations.         This case is a perfect\n\nexample.4\n\n        I know that, if asked, both Justices YOUNG and CORRIGAN would agree with my\n\nsentiments and would deplore these outbursts.         Both justices fully understand that\n\npersonal recriminations reduce the public’s confidence in the objectivity and wisdom of\n\njudges and in the Court as an institution.\n\n        With these reflections in mind, I urge them to reevaluate the utility of their ad\n\nhominem attacks and eliminate them. Surely each has significant confidence in the\n\nstrength of their legal arguments to allow those arguments to stand on their merits, absent\n\ndistracting attack props. Moreover, their personal assaults do nothing to resolve the legal\n\nissues before us; they do not benefit the parties to a case or the citizens of Michigan\n\nwhom we serve.\n\n        I sincerely regret having to address these matters in the first place and would\n\nprefer that this opinion were not necessary. But I cannot stand passively by and allow\n\n        4\n         The quotations cited by Justice YOUNG, post at ___ n ___, accurately point out\nstrong language I have used in the past to criticize the former majority’s legal reasoning\nin various cases. But this is far different from Justice YOUNG’s criticism today, the chief\npurpose of which is to impugn my motives in reaching legal conclusions, thus attacking\nmy character.\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fJustices YOUNG and CORRIGAN to accuse me and the justices in the “new majority” of\n\nbeing unprincipled and driven by inappropriate motives. Their attacks wrongly accuse\n\nJustices CAVANAGH, WEAVER, HATHAWAY, and me of reaching predetermined outcomes\n\nin many, if not all, cases rather than following the law, as we are sworn to do.\n\n       People respect the judiciary only insofar as they believe that judges decide cases\n\nimpartially and without ulterior motives. Justices YOUNG’s and CORRIGAN’s assertion in\n\nthis and previous cases that we have an “agenda” that involves selecting and overturning\n\ncertain precedents is unfair and untrue. Furthermore, it undermines respect both for the\n\njustices attacked and for those making the unwarranted accusations. Most importantly, it\n\nreduces public confidence in the judiciary as a whole.\n\n\n                                                         Marilyn Kelly\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f                             STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                    SUPREME COURT\n\n\nREGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN and UNIVERSITY OF\nMICHIGAN HEALTH SYSTEM,\n\n               Plaintiffs-Appellants,\n\nv                                                            No. 136905\n\nTITAN INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n               Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\nYOUNG, J.

This process produces a result whereby the parties and the public will\n\nnever know what criteria or standards several justices on this Court will employ until\n\nafter the decision has been made. This ad hoc, subjective process is the very antithesis of\n\nthe “rule of law” and instead denotes a system hijacked by the concurring justices, who\n\nappear to be guided and constrained only by their personal beliefs. That stare decisis is a\n\n“principle of policy,” as Justice HATHAWAY repeats many times, does not mean that\n\nanalysis of a case pursuant to the doctrine should be driven by each judge’s personal\n\npolicy choices.10 Nor does the fact that stare decisis is a “principle of policy” mean that\n\njudges need not announce a fixed set of principles that will guide their decisions.11 Yet\n\n\n       10\n          In particular, Justice HATHAWAY apparently fails to understand that stare\ndecisis, even as a principle of judicial policy, does not equate with a judge making\nindividual “policy determination[s],” ante at ___, as if she were a citizen-legislator. As\nany student of the law can explain, her theory represents the precise opposite principle\nthat governs courts in a society based on the rule of law. Judges serve an important yet\nlimited role in a constitutional republic. Not being of the policy-making branches of\ngovernment, they should never base their decisions on their own subjective policy beliefs.\nIf nothing else, Justice HATHAWAY’s admission that she is making her own personal\n“policy determination[s]” in cases at least provides a view into what has driven many of\nthe decisions produced by the new majority.\n       11\n           My criticism of Justice WEAVER’s approach is not, as she alleges, that she has\nsubscribed to a theory of stare decisis as an “inexorable command” that she now rejects.\nIn fact, it is precisely the opposite: She often subscribes to no objective test whatsoever.\nCases from time to time may need to be overruled, but the ultimate problem with Justice\n\n\n                                             6\n\fthis is precisely what characterizes Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY’s unique brand of\n\nfeckless jurisprudence announced today.\n\n       The rule of law, by definition, requires judges to decide cases on the basis of\n\nprinciples, announced in advance, rather than on a personal or subjective preference for\n\nor against a party before them. This ensures stability in the law despite the diversity of\n\njudges’ personal beliefs. Whether we, as judges, “like” the outcome is, quite simply,\n\nirrelevant to whether it reflects a correct conclusion of law. It is harrowing that Justices\n\n\n\nWEAVER’s approach is that she relies on her subjective application of “judicial restraint,\ncommon sense, and sense of fairness—justice for all,” rather than any defined legal\nstandard in making these decisions. And unlike her prior protests that “[c]orrection for\ncorrection’s sake does not make sense,” Devillers, 473 Mich at 622, Justice WEAVER is\nnow working to “correct” and overrule as many recent precedents as possible. Worse\nstill, she is content to do so without any serious stare decisis analysis as long as doing so\ndoes not offend her subjective “sense of fairness.” And, as the public is no doubt aware,\n“common sense” is not so common and Justice WEAVER has no greater fund of common\nsense than anyone else. If for no other reason, that is why simply “following the law” is\nthe best course for any serious jurist committed to the “rule of law” rather than the “rule\nof judges.”\n\n        Justice WEAVER also selectively quotes without context a passage from an\nextended law review article that I authored. See Robert P. Young, Jr., A judicial\ntraditionalist confronts the common law, 8 Texas Rev L & Pol 299 (2004). The article\nwas designed to highlight, in an arresting way, how difficult it should be for any judge\ncommitted to the rule of law to make the difficult policy choices necessary when\nmodifying the common law. Quite simply, policy-making in the judiciary is one of least\ndesirable and most difficult things for judges to do. This is because it is hard to assess\nthe trade-offs that competing policies might create, especially when, unlike the\nLegislature, judges cannot consider the competing policy positions of interest groups\naffected by the issue in question. However, since Justice WEAVER is not committed to\nthe rule of law, but instead applies her brand of “common sense,” she has no qualms with\njudicial policy-making in any context—common law or otherwise. This fact is attested to\nby her concurrence here and illustrated in recent decisions handed down by the new\nmajority that she has signed.\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fWEAVER and HATHAWAY either do not understand this concept or refuse to subscribe to\n\nit, preferring to base their decisions on subjective “policy consideration[s].”\n\n       Finally, Chief Justice KELLY has tried on several occasions to explain away what\n\nshe meant when she said the “new majority” would “undo . . . the damage [of] the\n\nRepublican-dominated court,” as she again attempts today. Chief Justice KELLY finds it\n\ndisquieting that I quote her remarks about the “new majority’s” agenda. She should. Her\n\nremarks are as disquieting as they are scurrilous. What is noteworthy is that Chief\n\nJustice KELLY has never repudiated what she said, apologized for it, or sufficiently\n\nexplained why that statement doesn’t mean what it plainly says. Instead, she merely\n\nprefers that I not repeat it for reasons that are obvious to all. Rare is it that a judge\n\npublicly tells the public that she has an agenda and what it is. I am glad that the Chief\n\nJustice was so candid because everyone can examine her conduct in light of her\n\nstatement. Her motivations for making this dreadful remark and whether her subsequent\n\nresolution of cases is consistent with her remark are questions for the public to decide.\n\n       Moreover, after being the target of much uncivil criticism by then Justice KELLY\n\nover the years, I am nonplussed by the Chief Justice’s pique at the passion of my dissent\n\nand the tone in which I have expressed it. One need only review the Chief Justice’s\n\ndissenting opinions over the years to acknowledge that her views on civility have\n\nconveniently changed as quickly as the new majority’s view regarding the importance of\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fpreserving precedent.12 Now that she is part of this Court’s philosophical majority, her\n\ncriticism of my impassioned tone recalls a line from Shakespeare: “The lady doth protest\n\ntoo much, methinks.”13\n\n\n       12\n          See, e.g., People v Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"842634\"><a href=\"/opinion/842634/people-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331, 335 n 4, 339 n 13; 733 NW2d 351\n(2007) (KELLY, J., dissenting) (accusing the majority of “again unnecessarily chip[ing]\naway at the Double Jeopardy Clause” and “mangling” double jeopardy jurisprudence and\nnoting that “in its zeal, [the majority] will at times punish a defendant twice for the same\noffense.”); Rowland, 477 Mich at 256-257 & n 13, 266 (KELLY, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (“The majority has ordained itself master of such ‘higher law’ [i.e.,\nlaw ‘“manufactured for each special occasion out of our own private feelings and\nopinions”’].

Given the context that this\n\nremark was made just after the defeat of Chief Justice TAYLOR in the last election, Chief\n\nJustice KELLY’s final comment that “we will not sleep on the bench” was a particularly\n\nuncivil reference denigrating our distinguished former colleague.14 Chief Justice KELLY\n\nwas present during the arguments of the case in which it was falsely asserted that Chief\n\nJustice TAYLOR fell asleep, and she knew, or should have known, that the claim was\n\nfalse.

Simply stated, they are not statutes that limit the period of\n      time in which a claimant may file an action. Rather, they concern the time\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       The one-year-back rule “limits the amount of personal protection insurance (PIP)\n\nbenefits recoverable to those incurred within one year before the action was\n\ncommenced.” Cameron, 476 Mich at 58 n 1. As Cameron explained:\n\n               By its unambiguous terms, MCL 600.5851(1) concerns when a\n       minor or person suffering from insanity may “make the entry or bring the\n       action.” It does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an action has\n       been brought. MCL 600.5851(1) then is irrelevant to the damages-limiting\n       one-year-back provision of MCL 500.3145(1). Thus, to be clear, the\n       minority/insanity tolling provision in MCL 600.5851(1) does not operate to\n       toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1). [Id. at 62.]\n\nThat is, the one-year-back rule by its straightforward language serves only as a limitation\n\non the recovery of benefits; it does not define a period within which a claimant may file a\n\ncause of action. Therefore, the one-year-back rule is not a statute of limitations, and it\n\nlies outside the scope of what is affected by the RJA’s minority/insanity tolling provision.\n\n\n\n\n       period for which compensation may be awarded once a determination of\n       rights thereto has been made.\n\n             Moreover, the one- and two-year-back rules do not serve the same\n       purposes as do typical statutes of limitations.\n\n                                          * * *\n\n              . . . The rules do not perform the functions traditionally associated\n       with statutes of limitations because they do not operate to cut off a claim,\n       but merely limit the remedy obtainable. They do not disallow the action or\n       the recovery—a petition may be filed long after an injury and benefits may\n       be awarded in response thereto—they merely limit the award once it has\n       been granted.\n\n              Therefore, on the basis of the language of the rules, we perceive no\n       logical reason for characterizing the one- and two-year-back rules as\n       statutes of limitations.

Second, as Cameron itself explained:\n\n\n      6\n          Justice WEAVER would also overrule Cameron because it is inconsistent with\n“the reasons in [her] dissent to the Cameron decision.” In her dissent, she concluded that\nthe one-year-back rule applies when the plaintiff is able to bring an action beyond one\nyear from the date of the accident because he provided notice or was previously paid\nbenefits, but does not apply when notice was not provided and benefits were not\npreviously paid. However, as Cameron itself explained, 476 Mich at 69-72, such a\nconclusion is inconsistent with the clear language of MCL 500.3145(1), which contains\nthree pertinent provisions. The first provides that if notice was not provided and benefits\nwere not previously paid, the action must be filed within one year after the accident. The\nsecond provides that if notice was provided or benefits were previously paid, the action\nmust be filed within one year after the most recent allowable loss was incurred. And the\nthird, known as the one-year-back rule, provides that losses incurred more than one year\nbefore an action was filed cannot be recovered. There is no indication whatsoever in the\nstatute that the Legislature intended that the third provision only apply where notice has\nbeen provided or benefits have been previously paid.\n      7\n          Moreover, contrary to the majority’s suggestions, Cameron is not at all\ninconsistent with Lambert v Calhoun, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1286045\"><a href=\"/opinion/1286045/lambert-v-calhoun/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 181; 229 NW2d 332 (1975), which\nheld that the minority/insanity tolling provision of the RJA “extends the time for bringing\nsuit under an act which contains its own statute of limitations”; with Rawlins v Aetna Cas\n& Surety Co, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2050093\"><a href=\"/opinion/2050093/rawlins-v-aetna-casualty-surety-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

It opined that to not read\n       the statute in this fashion would “severely limit the utility” of the\n       minority/insanity tolling provision. The Court then concluded that, “[i]n\n       order to advance the policy of RJA § 5851,” the minority/insanity tolling\n       provision applies to prevent the capping of damages under the one-year-\n       back rule of MCL 500.3145(1).\n\n              We believe this ruling was erroneous for the most uncomplicated\n       reason; namely, that we must assume that the thing the Legislature wants is\n       best understood by reading what it said. Because what was said in MCL\n       500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1) is clear, no less clear is the policy.\n       Damages are only allowed for one year back from the date the lawsuit is\n       filed. We are enforcing the statutes as written. While some may question\n       the wisdom of the Legislature’s capping damages in this fashion, it is\n       unquestionably a power that the Legislature has under our Constitution.\n       Thus, because Geiger’s conclusion that the minority/insanity tolling\n       provision applies to extend the one-year-back rule is contrary to what the\n       Legislature clearly directed in MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1),\n       Geiger is overruled.

Indeed, no case other than\nGeiger has held that the minority/insanity tolling provision of the RJA applies to the one-\nyear-back rule of the no-fault act. Although the lead opinion characterizes Welton as\nholding “that the one-year-back rule does not apply to claims preserved by an applicable\ntolling or saving provision,” and accuses Cameron of “implicitly overrul[ing] Welton,”\nWelton held no such thing. Welton’s statement that “[a]pplying the tolling to both the\nlimitation period and the period of recovery accords with common sense” is clearly\ndictum because Welton held that tolling did not apply in that case.

That is, the\n\nmajority believes that it can somehow discern the purpose of the statute from something\n\nother than its actual language, despite the fact that this Court has repeatedly held that this\n\nconstitutes an improper approach to statutory interpretation.        As I explained in my\n\nconcurring opinion in Cameron:\n\n               In Geiger v Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins Exch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1800292\"><a href=\"/opinion/1800292/geiger-v-detroit-automobile-inter-insurance-exchange/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

However, the only reason it gave for reaching such a\n       conclusion is that “[a] contrary rule would severely limit the utility of the\n       minority saving provision . . . .” Id. at 291. I do not necessarily disagree\n       with Geiger that not tolling the one-year-back rule may well “limit the\n       utility” of the tolling provision, perhaps even “severely,” but that is often\n       what happens when there are statutes that are in tension with one another.\n       It can be argued just as easily that to do the opposite, to toll the one-year-\n       back rule, would be to “severely limit the utility” of the one-year-back rule.\n       Indeed, it can be argued that to toll the one-year-back rule is not merely to\n       “severely limit its utility,” but to do it even greater damage by vitiating its\n       language altogether.[8] In the end, the Geiger rationale is not even a legal\n       rationale at all; rather, it is little more than a statement by the majority in\n       Geiger that it preferred a different statute than the one actually enacted by\n       the Legislature. [Id. at 83-84 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]\n\nThe majority criticizes Cameron on the basis that “[t]he only authority cited for [its]\n\ninterpretation was in Justice MARKMAN’s concurring opinion, which relied on dicta from\n\nJustice BRICKLEY’s lead opinion in Howard v Gen Motors Corp.” This statement very\n\nmuch illustrates the flaw in the majority’s approach to statutory construction-- it fails to\n\n\n       8\n          It is ironic that the majority accuses the Cameron majority of “read[ing] the\nstatutory language in isolation,” when it is the majority here that reads the\nminority/insanity tolling provision in a manner so far isolated from the one-year-back\nrule of the no-fault act that it gives the latter no meaning whatsoever.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\frecognize that the best indicator of the Legislature’s intent is the language of the statute\n\nitself. That is, the best “authority” cited in either the majority or concurring opinions in\n\nCameron for their interpretation is the actual language of the statutes at issue. That the\n\nmajority fails to apprehend this first principle of statutory interpretation sufficiently\n\nspeaks to the shortcomings in its analysis.\n\n       Finally, with regard to the majority’s apparent belief that it is somehow\n\nappropriate to overrule Cameron because Cameron overruled Geiger, even if Geiger was\n\ncontrolling precedent-- which it is not-- the majority errs by conflating all precedents as\n\ndeserving of equal respect.     However, as I explained in my concurring opinion in\n\nRowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"843020\"><a href=\"/opinion/843020/rowland-v-washtenaw-county-road-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226; 731 NW2d 41 (2007), “not all\n\nprecedents are built alike . . . .” Indeed, “some are better reasoned than others, . . . some\n\nare grounded in the exercise of discretionary judgments and others in the interpretation of\n\nplain language, [and] some are thorough in their analyses and others superficial.” Id. As\n\ndiscussed earlier, while Cameron entailed a serious effort to interpret the language of the\n\nlaw and to render our case-law consistent with this language, Geiger, as also explained\n\nearlier, was principally grounded in a desire to advance the policy of the\n\nminority/insanity tolling provision over the policy of the one-year-back rule of the no-\n\nfault act. For these reasons, Cameron’s overruling of Geiger can hardly be equated with\n\nthe majority’s overruling of Cameron.         The former entailed an effort to render the\n\ncaselaw of our state more consistent with the intentions of the Legislature, while the latter\n\nrenders it less consistent. The majority has never quite grasped that the issue of stare\n\ndecisis is one that cannot be viewed exclusively in quantitative terms, but must also be\n\n\n                                              8\n\fviewed in qualitative terms. By indiscriminately placing on equal footing all decisions of\n\nthis Court that overrule precedent, without considering whether each does so in order to\n\nfurther the intentions of the lawmaker or to further the intentions of the judge, the\n\nmajority communicates well the flaws in its understandings of stare decisis and of the\n\njudicial role itself.\n\n       In Liptow, the Court of Appeals, relying on this Court’s decision in Cameron, held\n\nthat MCL 600.5821(4) does not preclude the application of the one-year-back rule\n\nbecause MCL 600.5821(4) only exempts the state and its political subdivisions from a\n\nstatute of limitations and the one-year-back rule is a damages-limiting provision, not a\n\nstatute of limitations. This Court denied leave to appeal in Liptow, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007),\n\nand I agree with the Court of Appeals’ decision. As the Court of Appeals explained in\n\nLiptow:\n\n              MCL 600.5821(4) provides that actions brought by the state or its\n       subdivisions to recover the cost of maintenance, care, and treatment of\n       persons in state institutions “are not subject to the statute of limitations and\n       may be brought at any time without limitation, the provisions of any statute\n       notwithstanding.” We conclude that, by the plain import of this language,\n       the Legislature intended to exempt the state from statutes of limitations\n       when bringing an action to recover public funds. The language refers to\n       statutes of limitations and provides that an action may be brought at any\n       time. But the statute does not address damage limitation provisions or any\n       other limiting provisions. In other words, like the minority tolling\n       provision, MCL 600.5821(4) concerns the time during which the state may\n       bring an action; it “does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an\n       action has been brought.” Cameron, supra, 476 Mich at 62. Accordingly,\n       we conclude that MCL 600.5821(4), like the minority tolling provision of\n       MCL 600.5851(1), does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule of MCL\n       500.3145(1). Cameron, supra, 476 Mich at 61-62. [Liptow, 272 Mich App\n       at 555-556 (emphasis in the original).]\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fWhile the RJA, specifically MCL 600.5821(4), states that an action by the state or one of\n\nits political subdivisions “may be brought at any time without limitation,” the no-fault\n\nact, specifically MCL 500.3145(1), states that the claimant “may not recover benefits for\n\nany portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was\n\ncommenced.” (Emphasis added.) Having the right to bring a cause of action is not the\n\nequivalent of having the right to recover an unlimited amount of damages.9 Therefore,\n\nwhen these two provisions are read together, it is clear that while a political subdivision\n\nmay bring an action at any time, it cannot recover benefits for any portion of the loss\n\nincurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced. In other\n\nwords, MCL 600.5821(4), which pertains only to when an action may be commenced,\n\ndoes not preclude the application of the one-year-back rule, which only limits how much\n\ncan be recovered after the action has been commenced.\n\n       The majority overrules Liptow simply because it relied on Cameron. Because I\n\nbelieve that Cameron was correctly decided and that Liptow appropriately relied on\n\nCameron, I would not overrule either Cameron or Liptow. As is obvious from the flood\n\nof opinions that the majority has recently overruled, the majority justices’ repeated self-\n\nproclamations of adherence to stare decisis were merely a reflection of the fact that they\n\nagreed with the particular decisions that were being overruled. For a more thorough\n\ndiscussion of the majority justices’ past expressions of fealty toward stare decisis, see my\n\n\n       9\n           Indeed, the one-year-back rule may be more analogous to a cap on damages than\nit is to a statute of limitations.\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fdissent in McCormick v Carrier, __ Mich __, __; __ NW2d __ (2010).

For a thorough discussion of Chief Justice KELLY’s Petersen standard for\n\noverruling precedent, see my dissent in Petersen, 484 Mich at 350.10\n\n\n      10\n           Justice HATHAWAY contends that stare decisis constitutes a “policy\nconsideration” and that the “particular analytical approach will differ from case to case.”\nSimilarly, Justice WEAVER contends that stare decisis constitutes a “principle of policy”\nand that there is no need for a “standardized test for stare decisis,” as long as justices\nexercise “judicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness.” The problem with\nthese “approaches” is that “litigants will, of course, have no notice beforehand of which\n[“analytical approach”] will be employed, for the justices themselves will not know this\nbeforehand.” Petersen, 484 Mich at 380 (MARKMAN, J., dissenting). Under the\nconcurring justices’ “analytical approaches,”\n\n      there [would be] no consistently applied . . . process with which the judge\n      promises beforehand to comply. He or she may promise to be “fair,” and\n      he or she may seek to be fair, but there are no rules for how this fairness is\n      to be achieved. There is only the promise that the judge will address each\n      [precedent] on a case-by-case basis, using whatever [“policy\n      considerations”] he or she believes are required in that instance. And the\n      suspicion simply cannot be avoided that these varying and indeterminate\n      [“policy considerations”] may be largely a function of the outcome\n      preferred by the judge and by his or her personal attitudes toward the\n      parties and their causes. Any [pertinent “policy considerations”] will be\n      identified only after the fact, and these [“policy considerations”] may or\n      may not have been invoked in resolving yesterday’s dispute, and may or\n      may not be employed in resolving tomorrow’s dispute. Any judge can\n      concoct an after-the-fact rationale for a decision; the judicial process,\n      however, is predicated upon before-the-fact rationales. An ad hoc process\n      is not a judicial process at all. In the place of predetermined rules . . . [the\n      concurring justices] would substitute [“policy considerations”] to be\n      determined later. [Id. at 381-382.]\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f       What also cannot go without comment is the lead opinion’s conclusion that\n\n“upholding Cameron is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests”\n\nand, thus, that “this [Petersen] factor weighs heavily in favor of abrogating Cameron.”\n\nGiven that the lead justices believe that it is appropriate to consider their own conceptions\n\nof “public interests,” their relative silence is telling with regard to the “public interest” in\n\nthe viability of our state’s no-fault system.       It has been repeatedly recognized that\n\nbecause of the mandatory nature of no-fault insurance, the Legislature intended that it be\n\naffordable.11 The lead opinion gives little heed to the fact that its decision will once\n\n\nAlthough Justice WEAVER is correct that “[t]here are many factors to consider in deciding\nwhether or not to overrule precedent,” and Justice HATHAWAY is equally correct that the\napplication of stare decisis must take place on a “case-by-case basis,” this does not\nobviate the need to at least reasonably attempt to apprise the parties, and the citizens of\nthis state, before the fact what these factors might be, as this Court did in Robinson and as\nthe Chief Justice and Justice CAVANAGH did in Petersen. And whatever else can be\nunderstood of Justice HATHAWAY’s and Justice WEAVER’s “approaches” to stare decisis,\nthe application of these “approaches” has resulted in 13 precedents of this Court being\noverruled during this term alone and 6 other precedents being teed up for possible\noverruling during the next term, doubtless a record pace for dismantling the caselaw of\nthis state.\n       11\n          See, e.g., Tebo v Havlik, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1997891\"><a href=\"/opinion/1997891/tebo-v-havlik/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 366; 343 NW2d 181 (1984) (opinion by\nBRICKLEY, J.)

The problem with this argument,\n\nhowever, is that the statute says no such thing. The statute does not say that there is an\n\nunfettered right to recover the enumerated costs.

Third, under the one-year-back rule,\n\n“[r]ecovery . . . is limited to losses incurred during the year before the filing of the\n\naction.” Id. Univ of Mich Regents v State Farm concerned the statute of limitations\n\nportion of MCL 500.3145(1), not the one-year-back rule. Therefore, there is utterly no\n\ninconsistency between Univ of Mich Regents v State Farm and Liptow.14\n\n       The Court of Appeals dissent stated, “I believe that the holding in Liptow takes an\n\nirrationally and improperly narrow view of this statute by holding that it exempts entities\n\nlike plaintiff[s] from a one-year limitation on bringing an action but not from a one-year\n\nlimitation on recovering in such an action.” Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co,\n\nunpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued June 5, 2008 (Docket No.\n\n276710) (DAVIS, P.J., dissenting) (emphasis in the original).15 Cameron involved a very\n\n\n       14\n       This conclusion is further supported by the fact that Judges FITZGERALD and\nMARKEY were in the majority on both Court of Appeals panels.\n       15\n          The lead opinion here likewise contends that Cameron and Liptow “created an\nindefensible paradox” by limiting a plaintiff to the “hollow right” of being able to bring a\ncause of action without being able to recover any damages. It also states that “Cameron’s\ninterpretation of the saving provision actually operates to extinguish a claim, not save it.”\nHowever, the lead opinion ignores that a plaintiff will only be unable to recover damages\nif that plaintiff has not suffered any losses within the year preceding the filing of the\naction. Contrary to the lead opinion’s contention, this does not make Cameron and\nLiptow “unworkable.” It just means that they work differently than the lead justices\n\n\n                                             15\n\fsimilar situation. In my concurring opinion in Cameron, I indicated that I was concerned\n\nbecause\n\n       although the tolling provision instructs minors and insane persons that they\n       are entitled to wait until one year after their legal disabilities have been\n       removed to bring their civil actions, if they do wait, they will only be\n       allowed to recover what may be a portion of the total damages incurred.\n       [Cameron, 476 Mich at 73 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]\n\nHowever, I concluded that, regardless of my concerns about the wisdom (or lack thereof)\n\nof the statute, a judge is bound to follow this language. The same remains true here.\n\nAlthough to some it may seem less than optimal to exempt entities such as plaintiffs from\n\na one-year limitation on bringing an action, but not also from a one-year limitation on\n\nrecovery in that an action, that is clearly what the Legislature has done, and it is entitled\n\nto act in a way that is viewed with disapproval by members of the judiciary.\n\n       Nor is this, assuming arguendo that such is a relevant consideration, an “absurd\n\nresult.” Even to the extent that an “absurd result” doctrine exists in Michigan,16 a result\n\n\n\nwould like them to work. Furthermore, it is not Cameron or “Cameron’s interpretation of\nthe saving provision” that prohibits a plaintiff from recovering losses incurred more than\none year before the action was filed; it is the Legislature’s adoption of the one-year-back\nrule in the no-fault act. The lead opinion also states that Cameron and Liptow are\n“unworkable” because they deny plaintiffs “the legal recourse the Legislature provided\n[them], which is . . . to recover the damages [they] incurred more than a year earlier.”\nThe problem with this assertion is that the Legislature has provided no such right.\nInstead, the Legislature has only provided certain people and entities the right to bring a\ncause of action after the period of limitations has expired. Nowhere, however, has the\nLegislature provided these same people and entities the right to recover an unlimited\namount of money in those actions.\n       16\n         Whether the “absurd result” doctrine should exist in Michigan is a matter of\nsome debate, but the Court need not address the question in this case because, as\ndiscussed, what was done here by the Legislature was not absurd. It suffices to note,\n\n\n                                             16\n\fis only “absurd” if it is “‘quite impossible that [the Legislature] could have intended the\n\nresult . . . .’” Id. at 85 n 9 (MARKMAN, J., concurring), quoting Public Citizen v United\n\nStates Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112305\"><a href=\"/opinion/112305/public-citizen-v-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 470-471; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112305\"><a href=\"/opinion/112305/public-citizen-v-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because I believe, for the reasons set forth\n\nabove, that the one-year-back rule does apply to plaintiffs’ claim, I conclude that\n\nplaintiffs’ damages are not recoverable. Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeals.\n\n       CORRIGAN and YOUNG, JJ., concurred with MARKMAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f</pre>",
