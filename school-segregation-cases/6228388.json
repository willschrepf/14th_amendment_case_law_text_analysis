On consideration of the EEOC’s petition for\nrehearing, the panel has voted unanimously to deny rehear-\ning. A judge in active service called for a vote on the request\nfor rehearing en banc. A majority of judges in active service\nvoted to deny rehearing en banc. Chief Judge Wood and\nJudges Rovner and Hamilton voted to grant rehearing en\nbanc.\n    It is therefore ordered that the petition for rehearing and\nfor rehearing en banc is DENIED.\n\fNo. 15-3201                                                     3\n\n   WOOD, Chief Judge, and ROVNER and HAMILTON,\nCircuit Judges, dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.\n     This case presents a straightforward question under\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: Does a business’s\npolicy of segregating employees and intentionally assigning\nmembers of different races to different stores “tend to deprive\nany individual of employment opportunities” on the basis of\nrace? The panel answered this question “not necessarily.” I\ncannot agree with that conclusion. The importance of the\nquestion and the seriousness with which we must approach\nall racial classifications convince me that this case is worth the\nattention of the full court.\n                                 I\n    Title VII makes it unlawful for any employer to “limit,\nsegregate, or classify his employees … in any way which\nwould deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\nemployment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his\nstatus as an employee, because of such individual’s race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission argues\nthat AutoZone violated this provision when it used race as the\ndefining characteristic for sorting employees into separate\nfacilities—in this case, a “Hispanic” store located at South\nKedzie Avenue and West 49th Street, and an “African-\nAmerican” store in Chicago’s Roseland neighborhood. The\nCommission, whose factual allegations we must credit at this\nstage, claims that AutoZone went so far as to transfer one\nAfrican-American employee, Kevin Stuckey, from the Kedzie\nstore to the Roseland store in order to ensure the racial\nhomogeneity of both locations.\n\f4                                                    No. 15-3201\n\n    Under the panel’s reasoning, this separate-but-equal\narrangement is permissible under Title VII so long as the\n“separate” facilities really are “equal.” In other words, if a\nTitle VII plaintiff cannot prove that her employer’s intentional\nmaintenance of racially segregated facilities diminished her\n“pay, benefits, or job responsibilities,” then her employer has\nnot violated section 2000e-2(a). See EEOC v. AutoZone, Inc.,\n860 F.3d 564, 565, 566, 567, 568 (7th Cir. 2017). That conclusion,\nin my view, is contrary to the position that the Supreme Court\nhas taken in analogous equal protection cases as far back as\nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), and it is\ncontrary to the position that this court took in Kyles v. J.K.\nGuardian Security Services, Inc., 222 F.3d 289 (7th Cir. 2000).\n    We can start with Brown to find support for the proposi-\ntion that separate is inherently unequal, because deliberate ra-\ncial segregation by its very nature has an adverse effect on the\npeople subjected to it. The Court in Brown observed that “the\nNegro and white schools involved have been equalized, or are\nbeing equalized, with respect to buildings, curricula, qualifi-\ncations and salaries of teachers, and other ‘tangible’ factors.”\nBrown, 347 U.S. at 492. Nevertheless, the Court held that\n“[s]eparate educational facilities are inherently unequal” be-\ncause separation itself has a detrimental effect on minority\nchildren. Id. at 495. The Supreme Court has adhered scrupu-\nlously to that holding. For example, in Parents Involved in Com-\nmunity Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, 551 U.S. 701\n(2007), in a part of the opinion for which he wrote for the\nCourt, Chief Justice Roberts reiterated that even well-moti-\nvated racial classifications are inherently suspect, and that it\nis never permissible to classify individuals in a way that\nmakes their race “determinative standing alone.” Id. at 723;\n\fNo. 15-3201                                                    5\n\nsee also id. at 748 (“The way to stop discrimination on the ba-\nsis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”).\n    Of course, private parties such as AutoZone are not\nsubject to the Fourteenth Amendment, but through\nlegislation that rests in part on section 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment—namely, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, of which\nTitle VII is a key provision—the same principles carry over.\nOur decision in Kyles makes that clear. As we explained in\nKyles, section 2000e-2(a)(2) broadens the protection offered by\nother parts of the Civil Rights Act, by proscribing\n“employment practices which in any way … would deprive\nor tend to deprive any individual of employment\nopportunities.” Kyles, 222 F.3d at 298 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). If this had been a private suit brought by\nStuckey, it might have been appropriate for the panel to\ndisregard the effect of AutoZone’s racial segregation on\npersons other than the plaintiff. But it was not. This was a suit\nbrought by the EEOC, under its authority to enforce Title VII.\nThe Commission made the point that, in addition to the\ndignitary harm Stuckey suffered by being the victim of overt\nracial segregation, AutoZone’s practice of designating the\nKedzie store as the “Hispanic” store and the Roseland store\nas the “African-American” store deprived people who did not\nbelong to the designated racial group of employment\nopportunities at their preferred geographic location. This\neasily describes an adverse effect, based on impermissible\ncharacteristics, on employment opportunities.\n                               II\n   The panel was worried that the Commission’s position—\naccording to which deliberate racial segregation necessarily\nharms employees—would leave no work for the language in\n\f6                                                  No. 15-3201\n\nsection 2000e-2(a)(2) calling for an employment action that\n“deprive[s] or tend[s] to deprive any individual of employ-\nment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect[s] his status\nas an employee.” I see no such risk. As I already have noted,\nto the extent that the statute requires proof of an adverse ef-\nfect apart from the inherent harms of racial segregation, the\nCommission has made that showing. The ability to work at a\nparticular store or in a particular geographic area is itself a\n“job opportunit[y]” within the plain meaning of the statute. If\nthe EEOC’s factual allegations are true, then AutoZone has\ndenied these job opportunities to certain employees based on\ntheir race, thereby violating the clear text of section 2000e-2.\nNothing in the text of Title VII requires the Commission to\nprove additional deprivations related to “pay, benefits, or job\nresponsibilities,” as the panel seems to assume.\n    Unlike the panel, I do not believe that the Commission’s\ninterpretation of section 2000e-2 strips the “adverse effect”\nrequirement from the statute. There are some (though rare)\ninstances of segregation that are neither invidious nor\ndegrading; these types of segregation are permissible under\nsection 2000e-2 because they do not adversely affect\nemployees. For example, a business that segregates restrooms\nor exercise facilities on the basis of sex does not necessarily\ndeprive its employees of employment opportunities or\notherwise harm them. Granted, it is harder to think of a\nlegitimate example involving racial segregation, but that is\nbecause, as Parents Involved emphasized, it is very difficult to\nthink of any legitimate example of racial classifications. The\nfact that racial segregation carries with it a unique stigma,\nwhich makes it inherently harmful, does not provide grounds\nto think that the statutory language requiring segregation to\nhave an adverse effect is superfluous. The same statute also\n\fNo. 15-3201                                                    7\n\ncovers color, religion, sex, and national origin; the validity of\nan action “limit[ing], segregat[ing], or classify[ing]”\nemployees on any of those other bases would require its own\nanalysis.\n                               III\n    The facts of this case are (I hope) unusual: we have a plau-\nsible allegation, backed up with evidence appropriately pre-\nsented at the summary judgment stage, that an employer is\ndeliberately maintaining racially segregated workplaces.\nSuch a practice is one that, at a minimum, tends to deprive a\nperson of employment opportunities (i.e., all jobs at the loca-\ntions for which his race is not a match) and adversely affects\nhis status as an employee by telling him that his job opportu-\nnities with this employer are limited by his race. Perhaps the\nEEOC could have put together more evidence to this effect\nbut, in my view, the statute’s broad language—which extends\nto actions that “tend to deprive any individual”—does not re-\nquire a factual showing any more extensive than the one that\nthe Commission already has provided.\n    Because the panel’s opinion, as I read it, endorses the er-\nroneous view that “separate-but-equal” workplaces are con-\nsistent with Title VII, I respectfully dissent from denial of re-\nhearing en banc.\n\f",
