Kirschstein\n\n 5   National Research Service Award Institutional Research Training\n\n 6   Grant program, also known as the \"T32\" grant program, of the\n\n 7   National Institutes of Health (\"NIH\").    The T32 program funds\n\n 8   pre- and post-doctoral training programs in biomedical,\n\n 9   behavioral, and clinical research.    T32 grants are meant to \"help\n\n10   ensure that a diverse and highly trained workforce is available\n\n11   to assume leadership roles related to the Nation's biomedical and\n\n12   behavioral research agenda.\"   NIH Guide, \"NIH National Research\n\n13   Service Award Institutional Research Training Grants,\" at 1 (May\n\n14   16, 1997), United States ex rel. Feldman v. Van Gorp, No. 10-\n\n15   3297, Joint Appendix (\"J.A.\") 2437 (2d Cir. Jan. 26, 2012) (\"NIH\n\n16   Guide\").   Positions funded through T32 grants may not be used for\n\n17   study leading to clinically-oriented degrees, \"except when those\n\n18   studies are a part of a formal combined research degree program,\n\n19   such as the M.D./Ph.D.\"   Id. at 2, J.A. 2438.   Instead, funded\n\n20   programs must train their fellows \"with the primary objective of\n\n21   developing or extending their research skills and knowledge in\n\n22   preparation for a research career.\"   Id.\n\n23              Institutions applying for T32 grants undergo a two-\n\n24   tiered review process.    It begins with a review of the proposal\n\n                                       4\n\f 1   by a twenty-member \"Initial Research Group\" (\"IRG\"), also called\n\n 2   a \"peer review committee.\"   IRG members are independent experts\n\n 3   in scientific fields related to that of the grant application\n\n 4   under review; they are not NIH employees.   Each member scores\n\n 5   applications based on his or her view of its scientific or\n\n 6   technical merit guided by specified criteria, including, among\n\n 7   other factors: the program director's and faculty's training\n\n 8   records, as determined by the success of former trainees; the\n\n 9   objective, design, and direction of the program; the caliber of\n\n10   the faculty; the institutional training environment, including\n\n11   the commitment of the institution to training and the resources\n\n12   available to trainees; and the institution's proposed plans for\n\n13   recruiting and selecting high-quality trainees.   The scores are\n\n14   then averaged to arrive at an IRG \"priority score.\"   Testimony of\n\n15   Dr. Robert Bornstein at 1190-91, July 21, 2010 (\"Bornstein\n\n16   Testimony\"), J.A. 1955.   This score is included with the IRG\n\n17   members' written comments in a summary statement, which is\n\n18   transmitted to the NIH.\n\n19               The \"second tier\" of review is performed by the\n\n20   advisory council of the appropriate constituent organization of\n\n21   the NIH, in this case the National Institute of Mental Health\n\n22   (\"NIMH\").   The advisory council ranks the applications by\n\n23   priority score, and establishes a \"pay line\" at the point in the\n\n24   list of applications where there is no more funding available;\n\n25   only the applications above the \"pay line\" are recommended to the\n\n                                       5\n\f 1   director of the funding institute as potential grant recipients.\n\n 2   \"The role of the advisory council is not to second-guess the\n\n 3   scientific review of the IRG.   Rather, [the council] reviews the\n\n 4   applications to ensure that they further the goals and interests\n\n 5   of the awarding institute.   Thus, the IRG review and the\n\n 6   resulting high-priority score are keys to NIH funding.\"     Id. at\n\n 7   1190, J.A. 1955-56.\n\n 8              Once an application has placed above the \"pay line,\"\n\n 9   the advisory council makes recommendations based on the\n\n10   scientific merit of the proposal, as judged by the IRG, and the\n\n11   relevance of the proposal to the awarding institute's programs\n\n12   and priorities.   Funding is typically approved by the NIH for one\n\n13   year, and recipient institutions are eligible for up to four\n\n14   years of additional funding.\n\n15              In order to renew a T32 grant, the recipient\n\n16   institution (in this case Cornell) must submit an annual renewal\n\n17   application and a progress report detailing the status of its\n\n18   project.   In contrast with initial grant applications, renewal\n\n19   applications are reviewed solely by the NIH on a noncompetitive\n\n20   basis.   The NIH considers the progress made under the grant and\n\n21   the grant's budget.   By regulation, the annual progress report\n\n22   must contain a \"comparison of actual accomplishments with the\n\n23   goals and objectives established for the period,\" and must\n\n24   specify \"[r]easons why established goals were not met,\" if indeed\n\n25   they were not. 45 C.F.R. ยง 74.51(d)(1)-(2).\n\n                                      6\n\f 1             Recipient institutions must also \"immediately notify\"\n\n 2   NIH of \"developments that have a significant impact\" on the\n\n 3   research program, including \"problems, delays, or adverse\n\n 4   conditions which materially impair the ability to meet the\n\n 5   objectives of the award.\"   Id. ยง 74.51(f).    This notification\n\n 6   must also include a \"statement of the action taken or\n\n 7   contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the\n\n 8   situation.\"   Id.; see also Draft OIG Compliance Program Guidance\n\n 9   for Recipients of PHS Research Awards, 70 Fed. Reg. 71312-01,\n\n10   71320 (Nov. 28, 2005) (\"Prompt voluntary reporting will\n\n11   demonstrate the institution's good faith and willingness to work\n\n12   with governmental authorities to correct and remedy the problem.\n\n13   In addition, reporting such conduct may be considered a\n\n14   mitigating factor by the responsible law enforcement or\n\n15   regulatory office . . . .\").\n\n16             Cornell's initial grant application at issue here\n\n17   sought funding for a fellowship program entitled \"Neuropsychology\n\n18   of HIV/AIDS Fellowship.\"    Van Gorp Grant Application at 1, J.A.\n\n19   2254 (April 24, 1997) (\"Grant Application\").    The application\n\n20   explained that the two-year fellowship would train as many as six\n\n21   post-doctoral fellows at a time in \"child and adult clinical and\n\n22   research neuropsychology with a strong emphasis upon research\n\n23   training with HIV/AIDS.\"    Id. at 2, J.A. 2255.   The training\n\n24   program would, according to the application, build on the Cornell\n\n25   faculty's extensive research into the neuropsychology of\n\n                                       7\n\f 1   HIV/AIDS, which included projects examining distress levels in\n\n 2   HIV-AIDS patients during the course of their illness, the\n\n 3   relationship between the neuropsychology of HIV/AIDS and\n\n 4   patients' abilities to function at work or in school, and the\n\n 5   possibility of using neuropsychological testing to predict\n\n 6   whether AIDS patients will suffer from dementia.       The\n\n 7   application further explained that van Gorp would serve as the\n\n 8   program director, and that he had a \"long history of successful\n\n 9   research, training and mentoring of students in HIV[] related\n\n10   work.\"   Id. at 40, J.A. 2295.\n\n11              The 123-page grant application outlined the\n\n12   fellowship's curriculum in detail.     Fellows would be required to\n\n13   take \"several formal, core didactic courses,\" and a number of\n\n14   elective courses.   Id. at 45, J.A. 2300.     In the first year of\n\n15   the fellowship, fellows would enroll in five core courses, some\n\n16   of which \"have been designed specifically for the HIV\n\n17   Neuropsychology Fellowship.\"     Id., J.A. 2300.   These core courses\n\n18   would be supplemented by a \"large number of courses, lectures,\n\n19   neuroscience educational programs, as well as other seminars in a\n\n20   variety of sub-speciality areas.\"      Id.   The curriculum for the\n\n21   second year, which included four core courses, would allow\n\n22   fellows to \"develop more independent research skills and devote\n\n23   more time to their HIV research.\"      Id.   The fellows' progress\n\n24   under the grant would be monitored monthly by a formal training\n\n25   committee comprised of several faculty members, as \"[o]ngoing\n\n                                        8\n\f 1   evaluation of the curriculum, trainees and faculty is an integral\n\n 2   part of the training program.\"   Id. at 48, J.A. 2303.\n\n 3              The Cornell grant application identified a list of\n\n 4   fourteen faculty members who would serve as \"Key Personnel,\"\n\n 5   which the NIH defined as \"individuals who contribute to the\n\n 6   scientific development or execution of the project in a\n\n 7   substantive way.\"   NIH Grant Application Instructions at 26, J.A.\n\n 8   2612 (June 8, 1999).   The application described in detail some of\n\n 9   these research projects.   It also asserted, \"Our faculty has a\n\n10   solid track record in quality and productive research in brain-\n\n11   behavior issues, including research in HIV/AIDS-related research\n\n12   [sic].\"   Grant Application at 48, J.A. 2303.   And the application\n\n13   identified additional institutions which would serve as clinical\n\n14   resources, including Cornell University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering\n\n15   Cancer Center, St. Vincent's Hospital, and Gay Men's Health\n\n16   Crisis Center.\n\n17              In describing the fellowship program's commitment to\n\n18   research training, the grant application explained that \"the\n\n19   majority of [the fellows'] clinical work will be with persons\n\n20   with HIV infection.\"   Grant Application at 44, J.A. 2299.\n\n21   Fellows would \"devote an average of 75% of their time to research\n\n22   and an average of 25% [of their] time to clinical work with\n\n23   persons with HIV/AIDS and other neuropsychiatric disorders.\"    Id.\n\n24              The IRG gave Cornell's grant application a high\n\n25   priority score, and the NIH subsequently approved funding for two\n\n                                      9\n\f 1   fellows for the fiscal year beginning September 30, 1997, with\n\n 2   the possibility of additional funding for up to four additional\n\n 3   years.   Cornell submitted renewal applications in each of the\n\n 4   following four years, from fiscal year 1999 (July 1, 1998,\n\n 5   through June 30, 1999) to fiscal year 2002 (July 1, 2001, through\n\n 6   June 30, 2002), all of which the NIH approved.     In the\n\n 7   accompanying annual progress reports, Cornell and van Gorp\n\n 8   indicated that there had been no material alterations to the\n\n 9   program as described in the original grant application.\n\n10                In the renewal application for the second renewal year\n\n11   (the third year overall), for example, Cornell and van Gorp wrote\n\n12   that \"[a]ll core and supporting faculty listed in our original\n\n13   application are continuing. . . .      There have been no alterations\n\n14   in the courses or training program from that listed in the\n\n15   original application, except for the addition of two [specified]\n\n16   courses . . . .\"    1999 Progress Report at 7, J.A. 2402 (January\n\n17   19, 1999).    The renewal application also explained that the\n\n18   program had been relocated from Cornell's White Plains campus to\n\n19   its New York City (Manhattan) campus in order to provide fellows\n\n20   with \"immediate access to subjects and patients who have\n\n21   HIV/AIDS.\"    Id.   The renewal applications for the fourth and\n\n22   fifth year stated that \"[t]he core structure of our training\n\n23   program has remained the same as in years past and to that\n\n24   described in our initial application.\"     2000 Progress Report at\n\n25   4, J.A. 2411 (January 24, 2000); 2001 Progress Report at 5, J.A.\n\n                                       10\n\f 1   2422 (January 22, 2001).   The NIH approved each of these renewal\n\n 2   applications.\n\n 3             In September 1998, at about the time the first renewal-\n\n 4   year began, Daniel Feldman, the plaintiff,1 was selected by\n\n 5   Cornell to participate in the fellowship program.   He left the\n\n 6   program in December 1999, before the completion of his two-year\n\n 7   fellowship.   Other fellows who participated in the program\n\n 8   included Elizabeth Ryan, Clifford Smith, Kimberly Walton Louis,\n\n 9   and Evan Drake.   At trial, Feldman presented evidence that the\n\n10   actual fellowship deviated in many ways from that described in\n\n11   the Grant Application, and that Cornell and van Gorp failed to\n\n12   inform NIH of these deviations.\n\n13             Testimony presented at trial indicated that some of the\n\n14   faculty members identified as \"Key Personnel\" in the initial\n\n15   application did not in fact contribute in any substantive way to\n\n16   the fellowship program.    Van Gorp acknowledged that the\n\n17   contributions to the program of two of these faculty members, Dr.\n\n18   Tatsuyki Kakuma and Dr. Michael Giordano, were considerably\n\n19   limited, if not entirely eliminated, by the fact that the two\n\n20   doctors were not in physical proximity to the fellows during the\n\n21   grant period.   Many fellows, according to their testimony, had\n\n22   little or no interaction with the remaining key personnel, and\n\n\n          1\n             Because this suit is being brought by Feldman on behalf\n     of the United States, Feldman is technically the \"plaintiff-\n     relator.\" See infra, note [3]. We nonetheless refer to him\n     simply as the \"plaintiff.\"\n\n                                       11\n\f 1   were unaware that these faculty members were or were supposed to\n\n 2   be available as resources.   In addition, according to this\n\n 3   testimony, fellows were largely unaware of research opportunities\n\n 4   at medical centers other than Cornell.\n\n 5              There was also testimony in the district court to the\n\n 6   effect that Cornell and van Gorp failed to notify NIH that the\n\n 7   curriculum outlined in the initial grant application was never\n\n 8   implemented.   Several core courses identified in the application\n\n 9   were not regularly conducted for fellows, and fellows were not\n\n10   informed that these courses were a required component of the\n\n11   program.   Moreover, according to this testimony, fellows were\n\n12   never evaluated or supervised by the training committee referred\n\n13   to in the Grant Application.\n\n14              Feldman also presented evidence that the research and\n\n15   clinical training described in the initial grant application\n\n16   differed significantly from the actual training received.     NIH\n\n17   rules provide that fellows in a T32 program \"must devote their\n\n18   time to the proposed research training and must confine clinical\n\n19   duties to those that are an integral part of the research\n\n20   training experience.\"   NIH Guide at 3, J.A. 2439; T32 Training\n\n21   Grant Announcement at 9, J.A. 2568 (June 16, 2006).   And, in\n\n22   accordance with these requirements, the grant application stated\n\n23   that \"the majority of [the fellowsโ] clinical work will be with\n\n24   persons with HIV infection.\"   Grant Application at 44, J.A. 2299.\n\n25   Further, in explaining the training program's relocation from\n\n                                     12\n\f 1   White Plains to Manhattan, the third-year renewal application\n\n 2   explained that \"[f]ellows [would be] housed within a large,\n\n 3   medical/surgical setting with immediate access to subjects and\n\n 4   patients who have HIV/AIDS.\"    1999 Progress Report at 7, J.A.\n\n 5   2402.\n\n 6                But, as the plaintiff summarizes the trial testimony,\n\n 7   out of the 165 clinical cases that the fellows saw during their\n\n 8   fellowship, only three involved HIV-positive patients.2    Pl.'s\n\n 9   Br. at 22.    Several fellows testified that much of the research\n\n10   that they performed under the grant program had no relation to\n\n11   HIV or AIDS at all.    For example, Clifford Smith testified that\n\n12   the research projects he worked on under the T32 grant were\n\n13   primarily related to epilepsy and aging, and did not involve an\n\n14   HIV population.    Out of the eight research projects that Evan\n\n15   Drake worked on during his fellowship, he said, only one focused\n\n16   specifically on HIV.    Feldman similarly told the court that he\n\n17   worked on only one HIV-focused project during his time as a\n\n18   fellow.\n\n19                In July 2001, after he had left the program, Feldman\n\n20   submitted a letter to the NIH complaining about the program's\n\n21   focus on clinical work rather than research, and the fellows'\n\n\n\n             2\n             The parties stipulated that of Ryan's 32 clinical\n     patients, two were HIV positive; of Smith's 35 clinical patients,\n     none were HIV positive; of Louis's 23 patients, none were HIV\n     positive; of Drake's 48 patients, none were HIV positive; and of\n     Feldman's 27 patients, one was HIV positive.\n\n                                       13\n\f 1   limited access to HIV-positive patients.    In March 2002, he\n\n 2   submitted another letter to the NIH, again complaining that the\n\n 3   fellowship program deviated from its description in the initial\n\n 4   grant application.    In response, the NIH asked Cornell to conduct\n\n 5   an investigation of the complaint, which Cornell completed in\n\n 6   June 2003.    Cornell then sent Feldman a letter informing him that\n\n 7   the investigation uncovered no wrongdoing.\n\n 8                On October 14, 2003, Feldman filed a qui tam complaint\n\n 9   pursuant to the False Claims Act (\"FCA\"), 31 U.S.C. ยง 3729 et\n\n10   seq.,3 alleging that Cornell and van Gorp made false claims to\n\n          3\n\n                  In a qui tam action, a private plaintiff,\n                  known as a relator, brings suit on behalf of\n                  the Government to recover a remedy for a harm\n                  done to the Government.

Feldman alleged that statements made in\n\n 3   these applications were false because the fellowship's\n\n 4   curriculum, resources, faculty members, and training differed\n\n 5   significantly from that described in the application, and in the\n\n 6   subsequent renewal applications representing that no changes had\n\n 7   been made to the program.   The complaint was unsealed in April\n\n 8   2007, after the United States declined to intervene in this\n\n 9   action.   See Cook County v. United States ex rel. Chandler, 538\n\n10   U.S. 119, 122 (2003) (\"The relator must inform the Department of\n\n11   Justice of her intentions and keep the pleadings under seal for\n\n12   60 days while the Government decides whether to intervene and do\n\n13   its own litigating.\" (citing 31 U.S.C. ยง 3730(b)(2)-(c))).\n\n14               On January 9, 2009, after discovery had been completed,\n\n15   Cornell and van Gorp moved for summary judgment.   On December 7,\n\n16   2009, the district court denied the motion, concluding that there\n\n17   were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the defendants\n\n18   made false statements in both the initial grant application and\n\n19   the renewal applications, and whether those statements were\n\n20   material to the funding decisions.    United States ex rel. Feldman\n\n21   v. Van Gorp (\"Feldman I\"), 674 F. Supp. 2d 475, 482-83 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n22   2009).    The district court also concluded that the plaintiff need\n\n\n\n     between 25 and 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or\n     settlement, plus reasonable attorney's fees. See 31 U.S.C.\n     ยง 3730(d)(2).\n\n                                      15\n\f 1   not establish actual damages to the government as an element of\n\n 2   an FCA claim because that statute's provision of civil penalties\n\n 3   for false and fraudulent claims allowed courts to \"find a\n\n 4   violation even in the absence of proof of damages to the United\n\n 5   States.\"   Id. at 481.   The court did not address, however,\n\n 6   whether Feldman's recovery would be limited to statutory damages.\n\n 7              On December 18, 2009, the defendants moved for\n\n 8   reconsideration of the summary judgment decision, arguing that\n\n 9   the district court had erred in failing to address the issue of\n\n10   whether Feldman should be limited to statutory penalties because\n\n11   he had not presented sufficient evidence of actual damages to the\n\n12   United States.   On May 3, 2010, the district court denied the\n\n13   motion, explaining that although the damages to the United States\n\n14   could not be calculated in the same way they would be in a\n\n15   standard breach-of-contract action because no tangible benefit\n\n16   had been received, the plaintiff would not be limited to\n\n17   statutory damages.   United States ex rel. Feldman v. Van Gorp\n\n18   (\"Feldman II\"), No. 03 Civ. 8135, 2010 WL 1948592, at *1-*2, 2010\n\n19   U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47039, at *4-*6 (S.D.N.Y. May 3, 2010).    The\n\n20   court said that the \"'benefit of the bargain' to the government\n\n21   is providing funds to recipients who best fit its specified\n\n22   criteria and that this benefit is lost when funds are diverted to\n\n23   less eligible recipients.\"   Id. at *2, 2010 U.S. Dist.

Therefore, \"if the fact-finder concludes that\n\n25   the government would not have awarded the grant absent the false\n\n                                      16\n\f 1   claims, it may properly conclude that the measure of damages is\n\n 2   the total amount the government paid.\"   Id., 2010 U.S. Dist.\n\n 3   LEXIS 47039, at *6.\n\n 4             Before trial, Feldman submitted a motion in limine to\n\n 5   exclude evidence including that of NIH's inaction towards Cornell\n\n 6   and van Gorp in response to Feldman's complaints about the\n\n 7   fellowship program.   On July 8, 2010, the district court granted\n\n 8   Feldman's motion to exclude that evidence.   The court concluded\n\n 9   that the evidence of NIH's inaction was irrelevant and therefore\n\n10   inadmissible under Rule 402 because \"no discovery was conducted\n\n11   concerning the standards [NIH used] to determine the existence of\n\n12   misconduct and whether those standards are at all similar to the\n\n13   elements of an FCA claim.\"   United States ex rel.

July 8, 2010).\n\n16   Moreover, the court concluded, even if \"marginally relevant,\" the\n\n17   evidence would have been excluded pursuant to Rule 403 because of\n\n18   the possibility that it would confuse or mislead the jury.4     Id.\n\n19             The case was tried to a jury for eight days in July\n\n20   2010, resulting in a partial verdict for Feldman.   The jury found\n\n21   the defendants not liable for false statements in the Grant\n\n\n\n          4\n             The district court similarly excluded evidence of\n     inaction on the part of the New York State Department of\n     Education and the American Psychological Association, but the\n     defendants do not challenge the exclusion of that evidence on\n     appeal.\n\n                                     17\n\f 1   Application and the first renewal application, but found\n\n 2   liability based on the renewal applications for the third, fourth\n\n 3   and fifth years of the grant, i.e., the second, third and fourth\n\n 4   renewal years.   On August 3, 2010, the district court awarded\n\n 5   actual damages in treble the amount NIH paid for the last three\n\n 6   renewal years of the grant โ- the trebling being provided for in\n\n 7   the FCA, 31 U.S.C. ยง 3729(a)(1) -- totaling $855,714.   The\n\n 8   judgment also included statutory penalties of $32,000, for a\n\n 9   total of $887,714.   The district court also awarded to the\n\n10   plaintiff $602,898.63 in attorney's fees, $25,862.15 in costs,\n\n11   and $3,121.47 in expenses.\n\n12               On August 25, 2010, the defendants filed a motion for\n\n13   judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), or in the\n\n14   alternative, for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59.   The defendants\n\n15   argued that there was insufficient evidence from which the jury\n\n16   could properly have concluded that the false statements at issue\n\n17   were material to the NIH's decisions to renew the T32 grant, and\n\n18   that the court should grant judgment as a matter of law, or that\n\n19   such a conclusion was against the weight of the evidence and\n\n20   warranted a new trial.   The defendants also argued that the\n\n21   district court erred in determining as a matter of law that\n\n22   damages were equal to the entire grant amounts for the years in\n\n23   which liability was found rather than submitting that question to\n\n24   the jury.\n\n\n\n                                      18\n\f 1              The district court denied this motion on December 9,\n\n 2   2010.

The court concluded\n\n 5   that Feldman had presented sufficient evidence for the jury to\n\n 6   conclude that the false statements were material to the NIH's\n\n 7   funding decisions, noting that NIH's guidelines and instructions\n\n 8   on the renewal applications unambiguously stated that it should\n\n 9   be notified of any changes made to the grant program.   Id. at *2-\n\n10   *5, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130358, at *4-*14.   The district court\n\n11   also relied on its opinion in Feldman III to deny the motion for\n\n12   a jury trial on damages.

Damages\n\n24              The False Claims Act prohibits a person from \"knowingly\n\n25   present[ing], or caus[ing] to be presented, [to an officer or\n\n                                     19\n\f 1   employee of the United States Government,] a false or fraudulent\n\n 2   claim for payment or approval.\"    31 U.S.C. ยง 3729(a)(1)(A).\n\n 3   Liability under the Act also requires a showing of materiality.5\n\n 4   Under the Act as currently in force, \"the term 'material' means\n\n 5   having a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of\n\n 6   influencing, the payment or receipt of money or property.\"\n\n 7   Id. ยง 3729(b)(4); see also Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 16\n\n 8   (1999) (\"In general, a false statement is material if it has a\n\n 9   natural tendency to influence, or [is] capable of influencing,\n\n10   the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was\n\n11   addressed.\" (brackets in original; internal quotation marks\n\n12   omitted) (criminal fraud case)).\n\n13             The FCA provides for damages equal to \"3 times the\n\n14   amount of damages which the Government sustains because of the\n\n15   act of that person,\" in addition to a \"civil penalty.\"    31 U.S.C.\n\n16   ยง 3729(a)(1).   The Act does not specify how damages are to be\n\n17   calculated, but the Supreme Court has recognized that the purpose\n\n18   of damages, even as multiplied, under the Act is to make the\n\n\n          5\n             In 2009, Congress amended the False Claims Act to add a\n     specific requirement that to be actionable a false statement must\n     be material. 31 U.S.C. ยง 3729(a)(1)(B). It purports to apply\n     prospectively and therefore would not apply to this case. See\n     Feldman I, 674 F. Supp. 2d at 480. Never prior to that enactment\n     and absent its materiality provision did we explicitly require a\n     showing of materiality in FCA cases, although six of the seven\n     circuits to address the issue did. See id. (citing decisions).\n     We need not decide here whether a showing of materiality was\n     required because, assuming that it was, the requirement has been\n     met, as we explain in Part II, below.\n\n\n                                       20\n\f 1   government \"completely whole\" for money taken from it by fraud.\n\n 2   United States ex. rel.

Because the\n\n11   district court here determined that damages could be established\n\n12   as a matter of law, we review that conclusion de novo.     See\n\n13   Bessemer Trust Co., N.A. v.

Longhi v. United States,\n\n21   575 F.3d 458, 473 (5th Cir. 2009), is one of first impression in\n\n22   this Court.   The defendants argue both that the district court\n\n23   erred in concluding that application of the standard benefit-of-\n\n24   the-bargain calculation as a methodology for determining damages\n\n25   was inappropriate in this case, and that it erred in deciding the\n\n                                     21\n\f 1   amount of damages as a matter of law based on the jury's verdict,\n\n 2   rather than allowing the jury to assess the amount of damages\n\n 3   due.\n\n 4   A.   Proper Measure of Damages\n\n 5              In most FCA cases, damages are measured as they would\n\n 6   be in a run-of-the-mine breach-of-contract case โ- using a\n\n 7   \"benefit-of-the-bargain\" calculation in which a determination is\n\n 8   made of the difference between the value that the government\n\n 9   received and the amount that it paid.   See United States v.\n\n10   Foster Wheeler Corp., 447 F.2d 100, 102 (2d Cir. 1971)\n\n11   (collecting cases); cf. Terwilliger v. Terwilliger, 206 F.3d 240,\n\n12   248 (2d Cir. 2000) (\"[S]o far as possible, [New York contract]\n\n13   law attempts to secure to the injured party the benefit of his\n\n14   bargain, subject to the limitations that the injury -- whether it\n\n15   be losses suffered or gains prevented -- was foreseeable, and\n\n16   that the amount of damages claimed be measurable with a\n\n17   reasonable degree of certainty and, of course, adequately\n\n18   proven.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).   This method of\n\n19   calculation is employed, for example, when the government has\n\n20   paid for goods or services that return a tangible benefit to the\n\n21   government.\n\n22              There are generally two ways of determining damages in\n\n23   such cases.   First, if the non-conforming goods or services have\n\n24   an ascertainable market value, then damages are measured\n\n25   according to the \"'difference between the market value of the\n\n                                      22\n\f 1   product [the government] received and retained and the market\n\n 2   value that the product would have had if it had been of the\n\n 3   specified quality.'\"   United States v.

If the non-conforming goods' or services' market value\n\n 7   is not ascertainable, then the fact-finder determines the amount\n\n 8   of damages by calculating the difference between \"the amount the\n\n 9   government actually paid minus the value of the goods or services\n\n10   the government received or used,\" as judged by the fact-finder.\n\n11   Id.\n\n12               The defendants contend that a \"benefit-of-the-bargain\"\n\n13   calculation was appropriate in this case, and that the district\n\n14   court erred by awarding the government the full amount of the\n\n15   grant for the years for which the violations were found rather\n\n16   than the difference between the value of the training promised\n\n17   and that actually delivered.   The plaintiff argues, to the\n\n18   contrary, that a different measure of damages is appropriate in\n\n19   cases such as this, where \"the defendant fraudulently sought\n\n20   payments for participating in programs designed to benefit third-\n\n21   parties rather than the government itself\" and the government\n\n22   received nothing of tangible value from the defendant.    Id.; see\n\n23   also Longhi, 575 F.3d at 473 (\"[W]here there is no tangible\n\n24   benefit to the government and the intangible benefit is\n\n25   impossible to calculate, it is appropriate to value damages in\n\n                                      23\n\f 1   the amount the government actually paid to the Defendants.\").\n\n 2   This approach rests on the notion that the government receives\n\n 3   nothing of measurable value when the third-party to whom the\n\n 4   benefits of a governmental grant flow uses the grant for\n\n 5   activities other than those for which funding was approved.     In\n\n 6   other words, when a third-party successfully uses a false claim\n\n 7   regarding how a grant will be used in order to obtain the grant,\n\n 8   the government has entirely lost its opportunity to award the\n\n 9   grant money to a recipient who would have used the money as the\n\n10   government intended.\n\n11             The plaintiff and the United States, as amicus curiae,\n\n12   argue that this is such a case:    The government received no\n\n13   tangible benefit from the T32 grant -- students and others may\n\n14   have, but not the government.     The grant represented an attempt\n\n15   to, but did not thereby, promote \"child and adult clinical and\n\n16   research neuropsychology with a strong emphasis upon research\n\n17   training with HIV/AIDS.\"   Grant Application at 2, J.A. 2255.   The\n\n18   plaintiff argues that the government is therefore entitled to\n\n19   damages equal to the full amount of grants awarded to the\n\n20   defendants based on their false statements.\n\n21             We conclude that the measure of damages advocated by\n\n22   the plaintiff and the United States is correct.\n\n23             Although we have not addressed this question, several\n\n24   of our sister circuits have done so in decisions that support the\n\n25   conclusion we now reach.

They argue that because\n\n11   \"[t]he ultimate beneficiary of all government grants or contracts\n\n12   is the public regardless of who receives the 'direct' benefit,\"\n\n13   the flow of benefits to a third-party should not be determinative\n\n14   of the damages measure.

Hibbs, 568 F.2d 347 (3d Cir. 1977).     There, the Third\n\n 3   Circuit applied a benefit-of-the-bargain calculation in an FCA\n\n 4   case involving the defendants' fraudulent statements to the\n\n 5   Federal Housing Administration regarding the condition of various\n\n 6   residential properties.     Relying on these representations, the\n\n 7   agency insured mortgages on several properties, and the agency\n\n 8   was required to pay these mortgages when the purchasers\n\n 9   defaulted.    Id. at 349.\n\n10                The government argued that its damages were the total\n\n11   amount of the mortgage debt it had assumed, insisting that \"had\n\n12   [the defendant] not furnished the false certification, it would\n\n13   not have insured the mortgage[s] and therefore would not have\n\n14   been called upon to make any payment.\"    Id. at 351.\n\n15                The Third Circuit rejected this argument.\n\n16                The government's actual damage was the\n17                decrease in worth of the security that was\n18                certified as being available, measured by the\n19                difference in value between the houses as\n20                falsely represented, and as they actually\n21                were. Since the government was given\n22                security which was less than what it was\n23                represented to be, the damages are\n24                essentially similar to those sustained when a\n25                defective article is purchased in a\n26                fraudulent transaction. In those instances,\n27                decisional law sets the damages as the\n28                difference in cost between that contracted\n29                for and that received.\n30   Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                       26\n\f 1             Similarly, in Coleman v. Hernandez, 490 F. Supp. 2d 278\n\n 2   (D. Conn. 2007), a case involving the so-called \"Housing Choice\n\n 3   Voucher Program\" or \"Section 8,\" under which the government\n\n 4   provides housing subsidies to qualifying individuals, the\n\n 5   district court declined to award the plaintiff the full amount\n\n 6   that the government paid to subsidize her rent, even though her\n\n 7   landlord had allegedly made false statements to the government by\n\n 8   overcharging the plaintiff for rent.   Id. at 280-83.   The Coleman\n\n 9   court acknowledged that in other FCA cases, courts had awarded\n\n10   damages equal to the full amount of the government's payment.\n\n11   Id. at 281-82.   But the court decided that in the case before it,\n\n12   the awardable damages were equal to the difference between the\n\n13   market rent, and the amount that the landlord charged the\n\n14   government including the additional, improper payments it had\n\n15   received, i.e., the amount of the overcharge.   Id. at 282.   The\n\n16   government was then made whole, receiving the full benefit of its\n\n17   bargain โ- trebled by statute.\n\n18             The defendants also look to Medicaid and Medicare FCA\n\n19   cases for support.   They contend that adopting the plaintiff's\n\n20   theory of damages, all such cases would result in damages equal\n\n21   to the full amount the government paid in reimbursements to\n\n22   physicians because \"the direct benefit always goes to patients.\"\n\n23   Defs.' Reply Br. at 5.\n\n24             This is not, however, the methodology generally\n\n25   employed by courts evaluating FCA claims based on Medicaid or\n\n                                      27\n\f 1   Medicare fraud.   In United States ex. rel. Tyson v. Amerigroup\n\n 2   Illinois, Inc., 488 F. Supp. 2d 719 (N.D. Ill. 2007), the court\n\n 3   awarded damages based on the difference between the amount of\n\n 4   Medicare payments that the defendant should have received, and\n\n 5   the amount that it had actually charged the government.   Id. at\n\n 6   739.   Similarly, in United States ex. rel. Doe v. DeGregorio, 510\n\n 7   F. Supp. 2d 877 (M.D. Fla. 2007), the court also held that\n\n 8   damages were the \"the amount of money the government paid out by\n\n 9   reason of the false claims over and above what it would have paid\n\n10   out if the claims had not been false.\"   Id. at 890.\n\n11               In short, in each of the cases cited by the\n\n12   defendants, the government paid for a contracted service with a\n\n13   tangible benefit -- whether it be medical care, security on\n\n14   mortgages, or subsidized housing -- but paid too much.    The\n\n15   government in these cases got what it bargained for, but it did\n\n16   not get all that it bargained for.   Thus, courts treated the\n\n17   difference between what the government bargained for and what it\n\n18   actually received as the measure of damages.   Here, by contrast,\n\n19   the government bargained for something qualitatively, but not\n\n20   quantifiably, different from what it received.\n\n21              This approach comports with the one we discussed in\n\n22   making a sentencing calculation of loss in United States v.\n\n23   Canova, 412 F.3d 331, 352 (2005) (rejecting argument that\n\n24   abbreviated medical tests performed by the defendant were as\n\n25   clinically sound as full tests required by Medicare so that the\n\n                                     28\n\f 1   government sustained no loss).   There, we explained that it was\n\n 2   not a court's task to second-guess a victim's judgment as to the\n\n 3   necessity of specifications demanded and paid for.    See id.\n\n 4   (\"Whether the testing time on a pacemaker, the number of rivets\n\n 5   on an airplane wing, or the coats of paint on a refurbished\n\n 6   building is a matter of necessity or whim, the fact remains that\n\n 7   the victim has been induced to pay for something that it wanted\n\n 8   and was promised but did not get, thereby incurring some measure\n\n 9   of pecuniary 'loss.'\")   To be sure, Canova recognized that \"a\n\n10   victim's loss in a substitute goods or services case\" does not\n\n11   \"necessarily equal[] the full contract price paid.\"   Id. at 353.\n\n12   But this was not because a defendant had the right to an offset\n\n13   for the value of the substituted good or service.    Rather, the\n\n14   proper focus of any loss calculation was on \"the 'reasonably\n\n15   foreseeable costs of making substitute transactions and handling\n\n16   or disposing of the product delivered or retrofitting the product\n\n17   so that it can be used for its intended purpose,' plus the\n\n18   'reasonably foreseeable cost of rectifying the actual or\n\n19   potential disruption to [the victim's] operations caused by the\n\n20   product substitution.\"   Id. (quoting U.S.S.G. ยง 2f1.1, cmt\n\n21   n.8(c)).   Canova emphasized that a court calculating loss cannot\n\n22   simply \"rewrit[e] the parties' contract to excise specifications\n\n23   paid for but not received and, thereby, conclud[e] that the\n\n24   victim sustained no [or a reduced] loss.\"   Id.\n\n\n\n                                      29\n\f 1                Canova's reasoning supports the challenged loss\n\n 2   calculation.    As a result of the fraudulent renewals, the\n\n 3   government was paying for a program that was not at all as\n\n 4   specified.    By contrast to the Medicare cases cited by\n\n 5   defendants, the government did not receive less than it bargained\n\n 6   for; it did not get the \"neuropsychology with a strong emphasis\n\n 7   upon research training with HIV/AIDS\" program it bargained for at\n\n 8   all.   Further, nothing in the record indicates that it could now\n\n 9   secure such a program at any lesser cost.    We therefore conclude\n\n10   that the appropriate measure of damages in this case is the full\n\n11   amount the government paid based on materially false statements.\n\n12   B. Fraudulent Inducement\n\n13                The defendants acknowledge that courts have applied the\n\n14   plaintiff's theory of damages in cases including Mackby, Rogan,\n\n15   and Longhi, but argue that those cases are distinguishable from\n\n16   this one because the defendants in each of those cases obtained\n\n17   funds through fraudulent inducement -- and that any such theory\n\n18   would fail here because no liability was found with respect to\n\n19   the Grant Application.    \"In a fraudulent inducement case, [it is]\n\n20   the false statements [that] allow the defendant to obtain the\n\n21   funding in the first place.\"    Defs.' Reply Br. at 9.\n\n22                According to the defendants, because a defendant in a\n\n23   fraudulent inducement case would not be eligible for any funding\n\n24   received after the initial false claim, a court in such a case\n\n25   could properly conclude that the defendant is liable for the\n\n                                       30\n\f 1   entire amount that the government paid.   But \"[h]ere, the jury\n\n 2   expressly found that the initial Application contained no false\n\n 3   statements, and there was no false certification ever at issue.\"\n\n 4   Id.   The defendants argue that Mackby, Rogan, and Longhi\n\n 5   therefore do not support the damages theory employed by the\n\n 6   district court.\n\n 7              We see no principled distinction, however, between\n\n 8   fraudulently inducing payment initially, thereby requiring all\n\n 9   payments produced from that initial fraud to be returned to the\n\n10   government (trebled and with certain fees and costs added as\n\n11   provided by statute), and requiring payments based on false\n\n12   statements to be returned to the government when those false\n\n13   statements were made after an initial contractual relationship\n\n14   based on truthful statements had been established.   Although it\n\n15   may be true that under a fraudulent inducement theory,\n\n16   \"subsequent claims for payment made under the contract [that]\n\n17   were not literally false, [because] they derived from the\n\n18   original fraudulent misrepresentation, [are also] . . .\n\n19   actionable false claims,\" Longhi, 575 F.3d at 468 (second\n\n20   brackets in original; internal quotation marks omitted), this\n\n21   proposition simply speaks to the time period for which FCA\n\n22   liability may be found.   It does not suggest that without\n\n23   fraudulent inducement, no subsequent false statements can result\n\n24   in FCA liability.\n\n\n\n                                     31\n\f 1             If the government made payment based on a false\n\n 2   statement, then that is enough for liability in an FCA case,\n\n 3   regardless of whether that false statement comes at the beginning\n\n 4   of a contractual relationship or later.   The only difference\n\n 5   would be that liability begins when the false statement is made\n\n 6   and relied upon, rather than at the beginning of the contractual\n\n 7   relationship, as it would be in a fraudulent inducement case.\n\n 8   Here, the jury found that materially false statements had been\n\n 9   made by the defendants in years 3, 4, and 5 of the grant, and the\n\n10   court properly awarded damages based on that finding.\n\n11   C.   Damages as a Matter of Law\n\n12             The defendants argue that the calculation of damages\n\n13   should have been decided as a question of fact by a jury, not as\n\n14   a matter of law by the district court.    Indeed, in FCA cases, the\n\n15   jury ordinarily does determine the amount of damages to be\n\n16   imposed upon the defendant.   See Chandler, 538 U.S. at 132.    We\n\n17   conclude, however, that here, where the question is not the\n\n18   benefit of the bargain between the plaintiff and the defendants,\n\n19   and the amount of each payment for which liability has been\n\n20   assessed is not in dispute, no further finding of fact as to the\n\n21   amount of the damages was necessary.\n\n22             As the government correctly observes in its amicus\n\n23   brief, awarding damages in this manner is not novel.    And often,\n\n24   the amount of damages in such cases has been determined as a\n\n25   matter of law in the course of the court's grant of summary\n\n                                       32\n\f 1   judgment to the plaintiff.   See, e.g., Longhi, 575 F.3d at 461\n\n 2   (affirming summary judgment and damages award); United States v.\n\n 3   TDC Mgmt. Corp., 288 F.3d 421, 428 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (agreeing\n\n 4   that the district court could properly decide the damages award\n\n 5   where the government received no benefit from the transaction).\n\n 6              United States ex rel. Antidiscrimination Center of\n\n 7   Metro New York, Inc. v. Westchester County, No. 06 Civ. 2860,\n\n 8   2009 WL 1108517, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35041 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 24,\n\n 9   2009), is illustrative.   There the federal government paid\n\n10   approximately $52 million as part of a federal grant to\n\n11   Westchester County for the purposes of housing and community\n\n12   development.   Id. at *2-*4, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35041, at *5-\n\n13   *11.   The grant required the county to certify that it would\n\n14   \"conduct an analysis of impediments . . . to fair housing choice,\n\n15   including those impediments imposed by racial discrimination and\n\n16   segregation, to take appropriate actions to overcome the effects\n\n17   of any identified impediments, and to maintain records reflecting\n\n18   the analysis and actions.\"   Id. at *1, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n19   35041, at *2-*3.   The court granted summary judgment for the\n\n20   plaintiff after finding that Westchester County had not conducted\n\n21   the analysis as promised.    The court agreed with the plaintiff's\n\n22   contention that damages should be the full amount the government\n\n23   paid, and rejected the county's argument that the damages\n\n24   question should be submitted to the jury.   There, as here, \"the\n\n25   United States did not get what it paid for,\" and there was no\n\n                                      33\n\f 1   role for the jury because \"Westchester's damages cannot be\n\n 2   reduced by reference to the alleged 'benefit' it provided to\n\n 3   HUD.\"   Id. at *3, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35041, at *9.\n\n 4              We conclude that in the case before us, inasmuch as the\n\n 5   damages equal the full amount that the government paid and that\n\n 6   amount is not in dispute, they were properly determined by the\n\n 7   district court as a matter of law.\n\n 8   D.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n 9              Finally, the defendants contend that the plaintiff did\n\n10   not submit sufficient evidence to the jury to establish by a\n\n11   preponderance of the evidence that the government suffered\n\n12   damages equal to the full amount of the T32 grant.   The\n\n13   defendants argue that \"to prove that the amount of damages was\n\n14   the entire amount of the grant, a relator would be required to\n\n15   prove that the government received no value -- at all -- through\n\n16   the grant work it funded.\"     Defs.' Br. at 37.\n\n17              The defendants support this contention by citing\n\n18   benefit-of-the-bargain cases.    The defendants' argument is\n\n19   therefore unavailing.   Unlike a benefit-of-the-bargain case, no\n\n20   specific amount of damages must be proved because, as we have\n\n21   explained at length, damages in this case equal the entire amount\n\n22   of the grant that was lost as a result of the fraud.\n\n23              II.   Materiality\n\n24              The defendants assert that the false statements to the\n\n25   government that are at issue were not material to the\n\n                                        34\n\f 1   transactions in question.   The district court therefore erred,\n\n 2   they say, in denying the defendants' motion for judgment as a\n\n 3   matter of law and for a new trial.7\n\n 4              We conclude that the jury had sufficient evidence from\n\n 5   which to conclude, as it did, that the defendants' false\n\n 6   statements materially influenced NIH's decisions to renew the T32\n\n 7   grant.\n\n 8             A motion for a new trial will ordinarily be granted \"so\n\n 9   long as the district court determines that, in its independent\n\n10   judgment, the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or\n\n11   [its] verdict is a miscarriage of justice.\"   Nimely v. City of\n\n12   New York, 414 F.3d 381, 392 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation\n\n13   marks omitted).   We review the district court's denial of a\n\n14   motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion.   Id.\n\n15             A motion for judgment as a matter of law may be granted\n\n16   only \"[i]f a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury\n\n17   trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a\n\n18   legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on\n\n19   that issue.\"   Fed.

Id., 2010 U.S.\n\n16   Dist. LEXIS 130358, at *7.    Bornstein was a member of the IRG\n\n17   that reviewed the defendants' initial grant application.    At\n\n18   trial, he testified as to the factors he considered material to\n\n19   his analysis of a grant application.    He asserted that although\n\n20   he reviewed the application, he did not expect that every faculty\n\n21   member identified in the initial grant application would be\n\n22   involved with the fellowship program.    He also testified that he\n\n23   did not expect the fellowship program to follow the exact\n\n24   curriculum outlined in the initial application.    The defendants\n\n\n\n                                       37\n\f 1   argued that this testimony established that not all false\n\n 2   statements in the renewal applications were material.\n\n 3                The district court rejected this argument because\n\n 4   Bornstein never reviewed the renewal applications, nor did he\n\n 5   have an independent recollection of reviewing the initial grant\n\n 6   application.    Id., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130358, at *7-*8.     The\n\n 7   court also concluded that \"[t]he absence of testimony by a\n\n 8   government official supporting a finding of materiality does not\n\n 9   mean that the jury was required to accept Bornstein's testimony.\"\n\n10   Id., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130358, at *7.      \"[T]he jury was well\n\n11   within its bounds to credit NIH's unambiguous guidelines and\n\n12   instructions over Bornstein's conclusory testimony that little in\n\n13   the Grant Application really would have mattered to him had he\n\n14   remembered reviewing it at all.\"       Id., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n15   130358, at *8.\n\n16                On appeal, the defendants do not dispute that the\n\n17   renewal applications contained NIH's instructions and guidelines.\n\n18   They contend instead that \"none of these statements, taken\n\n19   individually or together, establish what information was material\n\n20   to NIH's funding decisions on renewals,\" Defs.' Br. at 47, \"the\n\n21   Renewal Instructions and the Program Announcement are silent as\n\n22   to what information matters to NIH for purposes of its funding\n\n23   decision.\"    Id. at 52.   The defendants argue in substance that\n\n24   there is no evidence from which the jury could have decided that\n\n\n\n                                       38\n\f 1   the statements it found to be false materially influenced NIH's\n\n 2   decision to renew the T32 grant.8\n\n 3               This argument, however, misapprehends the focus of the\n\n 4   materiality analysis.   In Rogan, the defendant hospital admitted\n\n 5   patients through illegal referrals in violation of the Anti-\n\n 6   Kickback Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1320a-7b.   517 F.3d at 452.   Because of\n\n 7   the violation, the defendant was ineligible to receive Medicare\n\n 8   payments.   The defendant did not deny that it had violated the\n\n 9   Act, but instead argued that its failure to disclose information\n\n10   regarding the illegal referrals was immaterial to the\n\n11   government's decision to approve the hospital's Medicare claims,\n\n12   because materiality could only be established if a government\n\n\n          8\n              The defendants also argue, however, that the district\n     court erred in interpreting NIH's guidelines as \"unambiguous\" --\n     in other words, that to the extent the plaintiff did point to\n     evidence of materiality, that evidence was insufficient to\n     support a jury verdict. Defs. Br. at 52. The defendants note\n     that the renewal application's instructions do not specify what\n     information needs to be included in a progress report, only that\n     the report should include \"difficulties\" with or \"changes\" to a\n     grant program. Id. at 53. The instructions do not explicitly\n     state that grantees must report all changes. Because the NIH\n     guidelines are \"necessarily ambiguous,\" defendants argue that the\n     court cannot rely upon these guidelines as a \"legal standard for\n     materiality.\" Id.\n          But the district court never relied on these guidelines, nor\n     instructed the jury to rely on these guidelines, as a \"standard\n     for materiality.\" The guidelines served instead as evidence that\n     the jury was permitted to rely upon in evaluating what was\n     material to the government in its monitoring of grants.\n     Therefore, we agree with the district court that they provided\n     sufficient evidence from which the jury could reach a conclusion\n     as to materiality. To the extent that these guidelines are\n     ambiguous, it was the jury's function to resolve any disputes\n     about their meaning.\n\n                                      39\n\f 1   employee involved in the decision making process testified that\n\n 2   the government would have terminated payments.   Id.\n\n 3             The court rejected this view of materiality, explaining\n\n 4   that a \"statement or omission is 'capable of influencing' a\n\n 5   decision even if those who make the decision are negligent and\n\n 6   fail to appreciate the statement's significance.\"      Id.   As the\n\n 7   court stated, \"[t]he question is not remotely whether [the\n\n 8   applicant] was sure to be caught . . . but whether the omission\n\n 9   could have influenced the agency's decision.\"    Id.\n\n10             In short, even if a program officer does not\n\n11   subjectively consider a statement to be material, it can be found\n\n12   to be material from an objective standpoint because it is\n\n13   \"capable of influencing\" the program officer.    Id.    As the\n\n14   plaintiff in this case argues, materiality is \"determined not by\n\n15   what a program officer at NIH declares material, but rather [is]\n\n16   based on the agency's own rules and regulations.\"      Pl.'s Br. at\n\n17   48.\n\n18             The Rogan court discussed the purpose of laws\n\n19   prohibiting fraud:\n\n20             Another way to see this is to recognize that\n21             laws against fraud protect the gullible and\n22             the careless -- perhaps especially the\n23             gullible and the careless -- and could not\n24             serve that function if proof of materiality\n25             depended on establishing that the recipient\n26             of the statement would have protected his own\n27             interests. The United States is entitled to\n28             guard the public fisc against schemes\n29             designed to take advantage of overworked,\n30             harried, or inattentive disbursing officers;\n\n                                    40\n\f 1             the False Claims Act does this by insisting\n 2             that persons who send bills to the Treasury\n 3             tell the truth.\n 4   517 F.3d at 452 (citation omitted).\n\n 5             We agree with the plaintiff that the test for\n\n 6   materiality is an objective one.    It does not require evidence\n\n 7   that a program officer relied upon the specific falsehoods proven\n\n 8   to have been false in each case in order for them to be material.\n\n 9   The fact-finder must determine only whether the proven falsehoods\n\n10   have a \"natural tendency to influence, or be capable of\n\n11   influencing, the payment or receipt of money or property.\"   31\n\n12   U.S.C. ยง 3729(b)(4).\n\n13             To decide otherwise โ- that materiality must be\n\n14   established in each case based on the testimony of a\n\n15   decisionmaker โ- would subvert the remedial purpose of the FCA.\n\n16   The resolution of each case would depend on whether such a\n\n17   decisionmaker could be identified and located, and whether that\n\n18   particular person would have treated the claims as material,\n\n19   regardless of whether they were one of several individuals\n\n20   charged with evaluating the claims at issue.\n\n21             The defendants' contention would also render the\n\n22   language of the statute superfluous.   If no one other than an\n\n23   actual decisionmaker could determine whether a statement had a\n\n24   \"natural tendency to influence\" payment, the statute could have\n\n25   provided that a statement is \"material\" if it actually influenced\n\n26   a decision maker who was aware of the statement.\n\n                                    41\n\f 1              Our conclusion finds support in other areas of the law.\n\n 2   In TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976), for\n\n 3   example, the Supreme Court addressed the meaning of \"materiality\"\n\n 4   in the context of a suit brought under the federal securities\n\n 5   laws.   The Court determined that a fact is \"material\" if there is\n\n 6   a \"substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would\n\n 7   consider it important in deciding how to vote.\"   Id. at 448.\n\n 8              As an abstract proposition, the most\n 9              desirable role for a court in a suit of this\n10              sort . . . would perhaps be to determine\n11              whether in fact the proposal would have been\n12              favored by the shareholders and consummated\n13              in the absence of any misstatement or\n14              omission. But as we [have] recognized . . .\n15              such matters are not subject to determination\n16              with certainty. Doubts as to the critical\n17              nature of information misstated or omitted\n18              will be commonplace. And particularly in\n19              view of the prophylactic purpose of the Rule\n20              and the fact that the content of the proxy\n21              statement is within management's control, it\n22              is appropriate that these doubts be resolved\n23              in favor of those the statute is designed to\n24              protect.\n25   Id.\n\n26              The same reasoning applies here.   Like the securities\n\n27   laws at issue in TSC Industries, this objective approach ensures\n\n28   that the FCA serves as a robust prophylactic against fraud by\n\n29   putting the question of materiality to the jury, rather than\n\n30   attempting to trace it back to the state of mind of the\n\n31   decisionmaker.\n\n32              In Bustamante v. First Federal Savings & Loan\n\n33   Association of San Antonio, 619 F.2d 360 (5th Cir. 1980), the\n\n                                     42\n\f 1   plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the Truth-in-\n\n 2   Lending Act in a loan transaction.     The court noted that\n\n 3                when a security interest [with an exception\n 4                not relevant here] is acquired in real\n 5                property which is the residence of the person\n 6                to whom credit is extended, the borrower has\n 7                a right of rescission within three business\n 8                days of either consummation of the\n 9                transaction or \"the delivery of the\n10                disclosures required under this section and\n11                all other material disclosures required under\n12                this part, whichever is later . . . .\"\n13   Id. at 362.    Here again, the court applied an objective rather\n\n14   than a subjective materiality standard.    \"[T]o apply a subjective\n\n15   standard to the test for materiality would misperceive the\n\n16   remedial purpose of the Act.\"    Id. at 364.   The court concluded\n\n17   that if materiality could be established by a subjective\n\n18   determination of whether or not particular information would\n\n19   affect a credit shopper's decision to utilize the credit,\n\n20   unsophisticated or uneducated consumers would not be sufficiently\n\n21   protected.    Id.\n\n22                Having concluded that the test of materiality in the\n\n23   case before us is objective -- asking what would have influenced\n\n24   the judgment of a reasonable reviewing official -- rather than\n\n25   subjective -- asking whether it influenced the judgment of a\n\n26   reviewer of a proposal in the case at hand -- we agree with the\n\n27   district court that a reasonable jury could have found the\n\n28   defendants' statements to be material to the renewal decisions in\n\n29   the third, fourth, and fifth years of the grant.    Based on the\n\n\n\n                                       43\n\f 1   stipulations regarding criteria relevant to funding and the\n\n 2   testimony at trial, the jury had an ample basis for understanding\n\n 3   the grant process based upon which it could determine whether\n\n 4   statements that were made or omitted concerning changes to\n\n 5   curriculum, personnel and clinical opportunities in the renewal\n\n 6   applications had a \"natural tendency\" to influence NIH's funding\n\n 7   decisions.    The instructions regarding the grant application and\n\n 8   renewal process provided the jury with a clear understanding of\n\n 9   what information the NIH considers in evaluating progress\n\n10   reports, such as changes or developments to the program.\n\n11                The defendants did not inform NIH that not all faculty\n\n12   members identified in the initial grant were \"key personnel\" in\n\n13   the program.    The defendants also failed to inform NIH that\n\n14   several of the core courses listed in the proposed curriculum\n\n15   were never implemented, and that fellows were never evaluated by\n\n16   a training committee.    NIH was not informed that the fellows did\n\n17   not have access to research and clinical resources described in\n\n18   the initial grant application.    NIH was also not aware that the\n\n19   fellows had very limited access to HIV positive patients in their\n\n20   research.    In addition, many of the fellows spent much of their\n\n21   time working on projects unrelated to HIV, such as research into\n\n22   aging and epilepsy, which was not reported to the NIH.    We\n\n23   conclude that these facts were more than sufficient to allow a\n\n24   reasonable jury to conclude that had the facts been disclosed\n\n25   they would have had a natural tendency to influence, or would\n\n                                       44\n\f 1   have been capable of influencing, the decision to renew the grant\n\n 2   and pay money to the defendants pursuant to it.\n\n 3               We therefore also conclude that the district court did\n\n 4   not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial --\n\n 5   the jury's verdict was not \"seriously erroneous\" or \"a\n\n 6   miscarriage of justice.\"    Nimely, 414 F.3d at 392 (internal\n\n 7   quotation marks omitted).\n\n 8               III.   Exclusion of Evidence\n 9                      Demonstrating NIH's Inaction\n\n10               The defendants argue that the district court abused its\n\n11   discretion by excluding evidence of NIH's alleged failure to take\n\n12   remedial action in response to the plaintiff's complaints, and\n\n13   that a new trial is therefore warranted.    We review a district\n\n14   court's decision to exclude evidence for abuse of discretion.\n\n15   Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., 189 F.3d 218, 224 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\n16   \"We [also] review a district court's denial of a motion for a new\n\n17   trial for abuse of discretion.\"    United States v. Brunshtein, 344\n\n18   F.3d 91, 101 (2d Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 823 (2004).\n\n19               The defendants contend that they should have been\n\n20   permitted to elicit evidence of NIH's relative inaction in\n\n21   response to complaints because it is relevant as to whether or\n\n22   not their statements in the renewal applications were false and\n\n23   material.   Feldman told NIH about the defendants' fraudulent\n\n24   claims and, according to the defendants, the agency saw no\n\n25   validity to the complaints as evidenced by its failure to take\n\n\n                                       45\n\f 1   action beyond asking Cornell itself to investigate the\n\n 2   complaints.    The defendants argue that they should have been able\n\n 3   to present this evidence to the jury in an effort to persuade it\n\n 4   that the statements had not misled the agency.     If this evidence\n\n 5   was presented, they say, the plaintiff \"could then have put on\n\n 6   any rebuttal evidence about why the jury should find the\n\n 7   statements were false and material despite NIH's lack of reaction\n\n 8   when presented with those allegations.\"     Defs.' Br. at 61.\n\n 9                Federal Rule of Evidence 402, provides, inter alia,\n\n10   that \"[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.\"     The district\n\n11   court reasoned that the evidence in question was irrelevant\n\n12   because the NIH's failure to act in response to Feldman's\n\n13   complaints did not speak to the seriousness of those complaints\n\n14   or the likelihood that false claims had been made.     The jury did\n\n15   not have before it the standard that NIH used to determine\n\n16   whether or not action was warranted in response to a funding\n\n17   complaint.    \"[N]o discovery was conducted concerning the\n\n18   standards these agencies employ to determine the existence of\n\n19   misconduct and whether those standards are at all similar to the\n\n20   elements of an FCA claim.\"    Feldman III, 2010 WL 2911606, at *3,\n\n21   2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73633, at *7.      \"Specifically, as to [the\n\n22   plaintiff's] deposition testimony on the NIH decision, [he] does\n\n23   not, and indeed cannot, speak to the standards NIH used to judge\n\n24   the merits of his claims.\"    Id.    Without evidence as to what the\n\n25   standards of the agency were for beginning an investigation, the\n\n                                         46\n\f1   jury could not determine whether the complaints made by Feldman\n\n2   should have instigated one.9   Id., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73633,\n\n3   at *7-*8.\n\n4               The defendants further argue that to the extent that\n\n5   the district court excluded evidence of NIH's inaction pursuant\n\n6   to Rule 403, it did so in error.      While ultimately we would be\n\n7   inclined to agree with the district court, we need go no further\n\n8   in our analysis because the evidence was properly excluded under\n\n\n\n\n         9\n              The defendants point to United States v. Southland\n    Management Corp., 326 F.3d 669 (5th Cir. 2003) (en banc), where\n    the court considered the relevance of the course of conduct\n    between a landlord receiving Section 8 funds and HUD. The court\n    concluded that the communication between HUD and the landlord\n    demonstrated that \"HUD was willing to work with the Owners\" on\n    remedying maintenance problems, and that \"HUD seemed to recognize\n    that the property's noncompliance was at least partially\n    explained by a lack of funds and nearby criminal activity.\" Id.\n    at 677. Based in part on this pattern of honest and open\n    communication, the court concluded that there could be no FCA\n    liability. Unlike in Southland Management, there is no\n    indication here that the defendants communicated compliance\n    issues to the government or sought its help in addressing them.\n    Where the government acts in response to potential false claims,\n    its activity may reveal something about its understanding as to\n    whether those claims were deliberately false or the result of\n    extrinsic factors, as in Southland Management. But where, as\n    here, there is no evidence of government action, nothing relevant\n    can be ascertained without knowing for which of many possible\n    reasons it did not act.\n              The defendants also cite United States ex rel.\n    Kreindler & Kreindler v. United Technologies Corp., 985 F.2d 1148\n    (2d Cir. 1993), in which we stated that \"government knowledge may\n    be relevant to a defendant's liability.\" Id. at 1157. Indeed it\n    \"may be,\" but is not here where the significance of the knowledge\n    and the responsibilities of the recipients have not been\n    established.\n\n                                     47\n\f1   Rule 402 in any event.   This conclusion was not an abuse of\n\n2   discretion.\n\n3                               CONCLUSION\n\n4             For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of\n\n5   the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                    48\n\f",

Kirschstein\n\n 5   National Research Service Award Institutional Research Training\n\n 6   Grant program, also known as the \"T32\" grant program, of the\n\n 7   National Institutes of Health (\"NIH\").    The T32 program funds\n\n 8   pre- and post-doctoral training programs in biomedical,\n\n 9   behavioral, and clinical research.    T32 grants are meant to \"help\n\n10   ensure that a diverse and highly trained workforce is available\n\n11   to assume leadership roles related to the Nation's biomedical and\n\n12   behavioral research agenda.\"   NIH Guide, \"NIH National Research\n\n13   Service Award Institutional Research Training Grants,\" at 1 (May\n\n14   16, 1997), United States ex rel. Feldman v. Van Gorp, No. 10-\n\n15   3297, Joint Appendix (\"J.A.\") 2437 (2d Cir. Jan. 26, 2012) (\"NIH\n\n16   Guide\").   Positions funded through T32 grants may not be used for\n\n17   study leading to clinically-oriented degrees, \"except when those\n\n18   studies are a part of a formal combined research degree program,\n\n19   such as the M.D./Ph.D.\"   Id. at 2, J.A. 2438.   Instead, funded\n\n20   programs must train their fellows \"with the primary objective of\n\n21   developing or extending their research skills and knowledge in\n\n22   preparation for a research career.\"   Id.\n\n23              Institutions applying for T32 grants undergo a two-\n\n24   tiered review process.    It begins with a review of the proposal\n\n                                       4\n\f 1   by a twenty-member \"Initial Research Group\" (\"IRG\"), also called\n\n 2   a \"peer review committee.\"   IRG members are independent experts\n\n 3   in scientific fields related to that of the grant application\n\n 4   under review; they are not NIH employees.   Each member scores\n\n 5   applications based on his or her view of its scientific or\n\n 6   technical merit guided by specified criteria, including, among\n\n 7   other factors: the program director's and faculty's training\n\n 8   records, as determined by the success of former trainees; the\n\n 9   objective, design, and direction of the program; the caliber of\n\n10   the faculty; the institutional training environment, including\n\n11   the commitment of the institution to training and the resources\n\n12   available to trainees; and the institution's proposed plans for\n\n13   recruiting and selecting high-quality trainees.   The scores are\n\n14   then averaged to arrive at an IRG \"priority score.\"   Testimony of\n\n15   Dr. Robert Bornstein at 1190-91, July 21, 2010 (\"Bornstein\n\n16   Testimony\"), J.A. 1955.   This score is included with the IRG\n\n17   members' written comments in a summary statement, which is\n\n18   transmitted to the NIH.\n\n19               The \"second tier\" of review is performed by the\n\n20   advisory council of the appropriate constituent organization of\n\n21   the NIH, in this case the National Institute of Mental Health\n\n22   (\"NIMH\").   The advisory council ranks the applications by\n\n23   priority score, and establishes a \"pay line\" at the point in the\n\n24   list of applications where there is no more funding available;\n\n25   only the applications above the \"pay line\" are recommended to the\n\n                                       5\n\f 1   director of the funding institute as potential grant recipients.\n\n 2   \"The role of the advisory council is not to second-guess the\n\n 3   scientific review of the IRG.   Rather, [the council] reviews the\n\n 4   applications to ensure that they further the goals and interests\n\n 5   of the awarding institute.   Thus, the IRG review and the\n\n 6   resulting high-priority score are keys to NIH funding.\"     Id. at\n\n 7   1190, J.A. 1955-56.\n\n 8              Once an application has placed above the \"pay line,\"\n\n 9   the advisory council makes recommendations based on the\n\n10   scientific merit of the proposal, as judged by the IRG, and the\n\n11   relevance of the proposal to the awarding institute's programs\n\n12   and priorities.   Funding is typically approved by the NIH for one\n\n13   year, and recipient institutions are eligible for up to four\n\n14   years of additional funding.\n\n15              In order to renew a T32 grant, the recipient\n\n16   institution (in this case Cornell) must submit an annual renewal\n\n17   application and a progress report detailing the status of its\n\n18   project.   In contrast with initial grant applications, renewal\n\n19   applications are reviewed solely by the NIH on a noncompetitive\n\n20   basis.   The NIH considers the progress made under the grant and\n\n21   the grant's budget.   By regulation, the annual progress report\n\n22   must contain a \"comparison of actual accomplishments with the\n\n23   goals and objectives established for the period,\" and must\n\n24   specify \"[r]easons why established goals were not met,\" if indeed\n\n25   they were not. 45 C.F.R. ยง 74.51(d)(1)-(2).\n\n                                      6\n\f 1             Recipient institutions must also \"immediately notify\"\n\n 2   NIH of \"developments that have a significant impact\" on the\n\n 3   research program, including \"problems, delays, or adverse\n\n 4   conditions which materially impair the ability to meet the\n\n 5   objectives of the award.\"   Id. ยง 74.51(f).    This notification\n\n 6   must also include a \"statement of the action taken or\n\n 7   contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the\n\n 8   situation.\"   Id.; see also Draft OIG Compliance Program Guidance\n\n 9   for Recipients of PHS Research Awards, 70 Fed. Reg. 71312-01,\n\n10   71320 (Nov. 28, 2005) (\"Prompt voluntary reporting will\n\n11   demonstrate the institution's good faith and willingness to work\n\n12   with governmental authorities to correct and remedy the problem.\n\n13   In addition, reporting such conduct may be considered a\n\n14   mitigating factor by the responsible law enforcement or\n\n15   regulatory office . . . .\").\n\n16             Cornell's initial grant application at issue here\n\n17   sought funding for a fellowship program entitled \"Neuropsychology\n\n18   of HIV/AIDS Fellowship.\"    Van Gorp Grant Application at 1, J.A.\n\n19   2254 (April 24, 1997) (\"Grant Application\").    The application\n\n20   explained that the two-year fellowship would train as many as six\n\n21   post-doctoral fellows at a time in \"child and adult clinical and\n\n22   research neuropsychology with a strong emphasis upon research\n\n23   training with HIV/AIDS.\"    Id. at 2, J.A. 2255.   The training\n\n24   program would, according to the application, build on the Cornell\n\n25   faculty's extensive research into the neuropsychology of\n\n                                       7\n\f 1   HIV/AIDS, which included projects examining distress levels in\n\n 2   HIV-AIDS patients during the course of their illness, the\n\n 3   relationship between the neuropsychology of HIV/AIDS and\n\n 4   patients' abilities to function at work or in school, and the\n\n 5   possibility of using neuropsychological testing to predict\n\n 6   whether AIDS patients will suffer from dementia.       The\n\n 7   application further explained that van Gorp would serve as the\n\n 8   program director, and that he had a \"long history of successful\n\n 9   research, training and mentoring of students in HIV[] related\n\n10   work.\"   Id. at 40, J.A. 2295.\n\n11              The 123-page grant application outlined the\n\n12   fellowship's curriculum in detail.     Fellows would be required to\n\n13   take \"several formal, core didactic courses,\" and a number of\n\n14   elective courses.   Id. at 45, J.A. 2300.     In the first year of\n\n15   the fellowship, fellows would enroll in five core courses, some\n\n16   of which \"have been designed specifically for the HIV\n\n17   Neuropsychology Fellowship.\"     Id., J.A. 2300.   These core courses\n\n18   would be supplemented by a \"large number of courses, lectures,\n\n19   neuroscience educational programs, as well as other seminars in a\n\n20   variety of sub-speciality areas.\"      Id.   The curriculum for the\n\n21   second year, which included four core courses, would allow\n\n22   fellows to \"develop more independent research skills and devote\n\n23   more time to their HIV research.\"      Id.   The fellows' progress\n\n24   under the grant would be monitored monthly by a formal training\n\n25   committee comprised of several faculty members, as \"[o]ngoing\n\n                                        8\n\f 1   evaluation of the curriculum, trainees and faculty is an integral\n\n 2   part of the training program.\"   Id. at 48, J.A. 2303.\n\n 3              The Cornell grant application identified a list of\n\n 4   fourteen faculty members who would serve as \"Key Personnel,\"\n\n 5   which the NIH defined as \"individuals who contribute to the\n\n 6   scientific development or execution of the project in a\n\n 7   substantive way.\"   NIH Grant Application Instructions at 26, J.A.\n\n 8   2612 (June 8, 1999).   The application described in detail some of\n\n 9   these research projects.   It also asserted, \"Our faculty has a\n\n10   solid track record in quality and productive research in brain-\n\n11   behavior issues, including research in HIV/AIDS-related research\n\n12   [sic].\"   Grant Application at 48, J.A. 2303.   And the application\n\n13   identified additional institutions which would serve as clinical\n\n14   resources, including Cornell University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering\n\n15   Cancer Center, St. Vincent's Hospital, and Gay Men's Health\n\n16   Crisis Center.\n\n17              In describing the fellowship program's commitment to\n\n18   research training, the grant application explained that \"the\n\n19   majority of [the fellows'] clinical work will be with persons\n\n20   with HIV infection.\"   Grant Application at 44, J.A. 2299.\n\n21   Fellows would \"devote an average of 75% of their time to research\n\n22   and an average of 25% [of their] time to clinical work with\n\n23   persons with HIV/AIDS and other neuropsychiatric disorders.\"    Id.\n\n24              The IRG gave Cornell's grant application a high\n\n25   priority score, and the NIH subsequently approved funding for two\n\n                                      9\n\f 1   fellows for the fiscal year beginning September 30, 1997, with\n\n 2   the possibility of additional funding for up to four additional\n\n 3   years.   Cornell submitted renewal applications in each of the\n\n 4   following four years, from fiscal year 1999 (July 1, 1998,\n\n 5   through June 30, 1999) to fiscal year 2002 (July 1, 2001, through\n\n 6   June 30, 2002), all of which the NIH approved.     In the\n\n 7   accompanying annual progress reports, Cornell and van Gorp\n\n 8   indicated that there had been no material alterations to the\n\n 9   program as described in the original grant application.\n\n10                In the renewal application for the second renewal year\n\n11   (the third year overall), for example, Cornell and van Gorp wrote\n\n12   that \"[a]ll core and supporting faculty listed in our original\n\n13   application are continuing. . . .      There have been no alterations\n\n14   in the courses or training program from that listed in the\n\n15   original application, except for the addition of two [specified]\n\n16   courses . . . .\"    1999 Progress Report at 7, J.A. 2402 (January\n\n17   19, 1999).    The renewal application also explained that the\n\n18   program had been relocated from Cornell's White Plains campus to\n\n19   its New York City (Manhattan) campus in order to provide fellows\n\n20   with \"immediate access to subjects and patients who have\n\n21   HIV/AIDS.\"    Id.   The renewal applications for the fourth and\n\n22   fifth year stated that \"[t]he core structure of our training\n\n23   program has remained the same as in years past and to that\n\n24   described in our initial application.\"     2000 Progress Report at\n\n25   4, J.A. 2411 (January 24, 2000); 2001 Progress Report at 5, J.A.\n\n                                       10\n\f 1   2422 (January 22, 2001).   The NIH approved each of these renewal\n\n 2   applications.\n\n 3             In September 1998, at about the time the first renewal-\n\n 4   year began, Daniel Feldman, the plaintiff,1 was selected by\n\n 5   Cornell to participate in the fellowship program.   He left the\n\n 6   program in December 1999, before the completion of his two-year\n\n 7   fellowship.   Other fellows who participated in the program\n\n 8   included Elizabeth Ryan, Clifford Smith, Kimberly Walton Louis,\n\n 9   and Evan Drake.   At trial, Feldman presented evidence that the\n\n10   actual fellowship deviated in many ways from that described in\n\n11   the Grant Application, and that Cornell and van Gorp failed to\n\n12   inform NIH of these deviations.\n\n13             Testimony presented at trial indicated that some of the\n\n14   faculty members identified as \"Key Personnel\" in the initial\n\n15   application did not in fact contribute in any substantive way to\n\n16   the fellowship program.    Van Gorp acknowledged that the\n\n17   contributions to the program of two of these faculty members, Dr.\n\n18   Tatsuyki Kakuma and Dr. Michael Giordano, were considerably\n\n19   limited, if not entirely eliminated, by the fact that the two\n\n20   doctors were not in physical proximity to the fellows during the\n\n21   grant period.   Many fellows, according to their testimony, had\n\n22   little or no interaction with the remaining key personnel, and\n\n\n          1\n             Because this suit is being brought by Feldman on behalf\n     of the United States, Feldman is technically the \"plaintiff-\n     relator.\" See infra, note [3]. We nonetheless refer to him\n     simply as the \"plaintiff.\"\n\n                                       11\n\f 1   were unaware that these faculty members were or were supposed to\n\n 2   be available as resources.   In addition, according to this\n\n 3   testimony, fellows were largely unaware of research opportunities\n\n 4   at medical centers other than Cornell.\n\n 5              There was also testimony in the district court to the\n\n 6   effect that Cornell and van Gorp failed to notify NIH that the\n\n 7   curriculum outlined in the initial grant application was never\n\n 8   implemented.   Several core courses identified in the application\n\n 9   were not regularly conducted for fellows, and fellows were not\n\n10   informed that these courses were a required component of the\n\n11   program.   Moreover, according to this testimony, fellows were\n\n12   never evaluated or supervised by the training committee referred\n\n13   to in the Grant Application.\n\n14              Feldman also presented evidence that the research and\n\n15   clinical training described in the initial grant application\n\n16   differed significantly from the actual training received.     NIH\n\n17   rules provide that fellows in a T32 program \"must devote their\n\n18   time to the proposed research training and must confine clinical\n\n19   duties to those that are an integral part of the research\n\n20   training experience.\"   NIH Guide at 3, J.A. 2439; T32 Training\n\n21   Grant Announcement at 9, J.A. 2568 (June 16, 2006).   And, in\n\n22   accordance with these requirements, the grant application stated\n\n23   that \"the majority of [the fellowsโ] clinical work will be with\n\n24   persons with HIV infection.\"   Grant Application at 44, J.A. 2299.\n\n25   Further, in explaining the training program's relocation from\n\n                                     12\n\f 1   White Plains to Manhattan, the third-year renewal application\n\n 2   explained that \"[f]ellows [would be] housed within a large,\n\n 3   medical/surgical setting with immediate access to subjects and\n\n 4   patients who have HIV/AIDS.\"    1999 Progress Report at 7, J.A.\n\n 5   2402.\n\n 6                But, as the plaintiff summarizes the trial testimony,\n\n 7   out of the 165 clinical cases that the fellows saw during their\n\n 8   fellowship, only three involved HIV-positive patients.2    Pl.'s\n\n 9   Br. at 22.    Several fellows testified that much of the research\n\n10   that they performed under the grant program had no relation to\n\n11   HIV or AIDS at all.    For example, Clifford Smith testified that\n\n12   the research projects he worked on under the T32 grant were\n\n13   primarily related to epilepsy and aging, and did not involve an\n\n14   HIV population.    Out of the eight research projects that Evan\n\n15   Drake worked on during his fellowship, he said, only one focused\n\n16   specifically on HIV.    Feldman similarly told the court that he\n\n17   worked on only one HIV-focused project during his time as a\n\n18   fellow.\n\n19                In July 2001, after he had left the program, Feldman\n\n20   submitted a letter to the NIH complaining about the program's\n\n21   focus on clinical work rather than research, and the fellows'\n\n\n\n             2\n             The parties stipulated that of Ryan's 32 clinical\n     patients, two were HIV positive; of Smith's 35 clinical patients,\n     none were HIV positive; of Louis's 23 patients, none were HIV\n     positive; of Drake's 48 patients, none were HIV positive; and of\n     Feldman's 27 patients, one was HIV positive.\n\n                                       13\n\f 1   limited access to HIV-positive patients.    In March 2002, he\n\n 2   submitted another letter to the NIH, again complaining that the\n\n 3   fellowship program deviated from its description in the initial\n\n 4   grant application.    In response, the NIH asked Cornell to conduct\n\n 5   an investigation of the complaint, which Cornell completed in\n\n 6   June 2003.    Cornell then sent Feldman a letter informing him that\n\n 7   the investigation uncovered no wrongdoing.\n\n 8                On October 14, 2003, Feldman filed a qui tam complaint\n\n 9   pursuant to the False Claims Act (\"FCA\"), 31 U.S.C. ยง 3729 et\n\n10   seq.,3 alleging that Cornell and van Gorp made false claims to\n\n          3\n\n                  In a qui tam action, a private plaintiff,\n                  known as a relator, brings suit on behalf of\n                  the Government to recover a remedy for a harm\n                  done to the Government.

In\n\n 6   other words, when a third-party successfully uses a false claim\n\n 7   regarding how a grant will be used in order to obtain the grant,\n\n 8   the government has entirely lost its opportunity to award the\n\n 9   grant money to a recipient who would have used the money as the\n\n10   government intended.\n\n11             The plaintiff and the United States, as amicus curiae,\n\n12   argue that this is such a case:    The government received no\n\n13   tangible benefit from the T32 grant -- students and others may\n\n14   have, but not the government.

Relying on these representations, the\n\n 7   agency insured mortgages on several properties, and the agency\n\n 8   was required to pay these mortgages when the purchasers\n\n 9   defaulted.    Id. at 349.\n\n10                The government argued that its damages were the total\n\n11   amount of the mortgage debt it had assumed, insisting that \"had\n\n12   [the defendant] not furnished the false certification, it would\n\n13   not have insured the mortgage[s] and therefore would not have\n\n14   been called upon to make any payment.\"    Id. at 351.\n\n15                The Third Circuit rejected this argument.\n\n16                The government's actual damage was the\n17                decrease in worth of the security that was\n18                certified as being available, measured by the\n19                difference in value between the houses as\n20                falsely represented, and as they actually\n21                were. Since the government was given\n22                security which was less than what it was\n23                represented to be, the damages are\n24                essentially similar to those sustained when a\n25                defective article is purchased in a\n26                fraudulent transaction.

The\n\n15   government in these cases got what it bargained for, but it did\n\n16   not get all that it bargained for.   Thus, courts treated the\n\n17   difference between what the government bargained for and what it\n\n18   actually received as the measure of damages.   Here, by contrast,\n\n19   the government bargained for something qualitatively, but not\n\n20   quantifiably, different from what it received.\n\n21              This approach comports with the one we discussed in\n\n22   making a sentencing calculation of loss in United States v.\n\n23   Canova, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790692\"><a href=\"/opinion/790692/united-states-of-america-cross-appellee-v-john-canova/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 352 (2005) (rejecting argument that\n\n24   abbreviated medical tests performed by the defendant were as\n\n25   clinically sound as full tests required by Medicare so that the\n\n                                     28\n\f 1   government sustained no loss).   There, we explained that it was\n\n 2   not a court's task to second-guess a victim's judgment as to the\n\n 3   necessity of specifications demanded and paid for.    See id.\n\n 4   (\"Whether the testing time on a pacemaker, the number of rivets\n\n 5   on an airplane wing, or the coats of paint on a refurbished\n\n 6   building is a matter of necessity or whim, the fact remains that\n\n 7   the victim has been induced to pay for something that it wanted\n\n 8   and was promised but did not get, thereby incurring some measure\n\n 9   of pecuniary 'loss.'\")   To be sure, Canova recognized that \"a\n\n10   victim's loss in a substitute goods or services case\" does not\n\n11   \"necessarily equal[] the full contract price paid.\"   Id. at 353.\n\n12   But this was not because a defendant had the right to an offset\n\n13   for the value of the substituted good or service.    Rather, the\n\n14   proper focus of any loss calculation was on \"the 'reasonably\n\n15   foreseeable costs of making substitute transactions and handling\n\n16   or disposing of the product delivered or retrofitting the product\n\n17   so that it can be used for its intended purpose,' plus the\n\n18   'reasonably foreseeable cost of rectifying the actual or\n\n19   potential disruption to [the victim's] operations caused by the\n\n20   product substitution.\"   Id. (quoting U.S.S.G. ยง 2f1.1, cmt\n\n21   n.8(c)).   Canova emphasized that a court calculating loss cannot\n\n22   simply \"rewrit[e] the parties' contract to excise specifications\n\n23   paid for but not received and, thereby, conclud[e] that the\n\n24   victim sustained no [or a reduced] loss.\"   Id.\n\n\n\n                                      29\n\f 1                Canova's reasoning supports the challenged loss\n\n 2   calculation.    As a result of the fraudulent renewals, the\n\n 3   government was paying for a program that was not at all as\n\n 4   specified.    By contrast to the Medicare cases cited by\n\n 5   defendants, the government did not receive less than it bargained\n\n 6   for; it did not get the \"neuropsychology with a strong emphasis\n\n 7   upon research training with HIV/AIDS\" program it bargained for at\n\n 8   all.   Further, nothing in the record indicates that it could now\n\n 9   secure such a program at any lesser cost.    We therefore conclude\n\n10   that the appropriate measure of damages in this case is the full\n\n11   amount the government paid based on materially false statements.\n\n12   B. Fraudulent Inducement\n\n13                The defendants acknowledge that courts have applied the\n\n14   plaintiff's theory of damages in cases including Mackby, Rogan,\n\n15   and Longhi, but argue that those cases are distinguishable from\n\n16   this one because the defendants in each of those cases obtained\n\n17   funds through fraudulent inducement -- and that any such theory\n\n18   would fail here because no liability was found with respect to\n\n19   the Grant Application.    \"In a fraudulent inducement case, [it is]\n\n20   the false statements [that] allow the defendant to obtain the\n\n21   funding in the first place.\"    Defs.' Reply Br. at 9.\n\n22                According to the defendants, because a defendant in a\n\n23   fraudulent inducement case would not be eligible for any funding\n\n24   received after the initial false claim, a court in such a case\n\n25   could properly conclude that the defendant is liable for the\n\n                                       30\n\f 1   entire amount that the government paid.   But \"[h]ere, the jury\n\n 2   expressly found that the initial Application contained no false\n\n 3   statements, and there was no false certification ever at issue.\"\n\n 4   Id.   The defendants argue that Mackby, Rogan, and Longhi\n\n 5   therefore do not support the damages theory employed by the\n\n 6   district court.\n\n 7              We see no principled distinction, however, between\n\n 8   fraudulently inducing payment initially, thereby requiring all\n\n 9   payments produced from that initial fraud to be returned to the\n\n10   government (trebled and with certain fees and costs added as\n\n11   provided by statute), and requiring payments based on false\n\n12   statements to be returned to the government when those false\n\n13   statements were made after an initial contractual relationship\n\n14   based on truthful statements had been established.   Although it\n\n15   may be true that under a fraudulent inducement theory,\n\n16   \"subsequent claims for payment made under the contract [that]\n\n17   were not literally false, [because] they derived from the\n\n18   original fraudulent misrepresentation, [are also] . . .\n\n19   actionable false claims,\" Longhi, 575 F.3d at 468 (second\n\n20   brackets in original; internal quotation marks omitted), this\n\n21   proposition simply speaks to the time period for which FCA\n\n22   liability may be found.   It does not suggest that without\n\n23   fraudulent inducement, no subsequent false statements can result\n\n24   in FCA liability.\n\n\n\n                                     31\n\f 1             If the government made payment based on a false\n\n 2   statement, then that is enough for liability in an FCA case,\n\n 3   regardless of whether that false statement comes at the beginning\n\n 4   of a contractual relationship or later.   The only difference\n\n 5   would be that liability begins when the false statement is made\n\n 6   and relied upon, rather than at the beginning of the contractual\n\n 7   relationship, as it would be in a fraudulent inducement case.\n\n 8   Here, the jury found that materially false statements had been\n\n 9   made by the defendants in years 3, 4, and 5 of the grant, and the\n\n10   court properly awarded damages based on that finding.\n\n11   C.   Damages as a Matter of Law\n\n12             The defendants argue that the calculation of damages\n\n13   should have been decided as a question of fact by a jury, not as\n\n14   a matter of law by the district court.    Indeed, in FCA cases, the\n\n15   jury ordinarily does determine the amount of damages to be\n\n16   imposed upon the defendant.   See Chandler, 538 U.S. at 132.    We\n\n17   conclude, however, that here, where the question is not the\n\n18   benefit of the bargain between the plaintiff and the defendants,\n\n19   and the amount of each payment for which liability has been\n\n20   assessed is not in dispute, no further finding of fact as to the\n\n21   amount of the damages was necessary.\n\n22             As the government correctly observes in its amicus\n\n23   brief, awarding damages in this manner is not novel.    And often,\n\n24   the amount of damages in such cases has been determined as a\n\n25   matter of law in the course of the court's grant of summary\n\n                                       32\n\f 1   judgment to the plaintiff.

Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n 9              Finally, the defendants contend that the plaintiff did\n\n10   not submit sufficient evidence to the jury to establish by a\n\n11   preponderance of the evidence that the government suffered\n\n12   damages equal to the full amount of the T32 grant.   The\n\n13   defendants argue that \"to prove that the amount of damages was\n\n14   the entire amount of the grant, a relator would be required to\n\n15   prove that the government received no value -- at all -- through\n\n16   the grant work it funded.\"     Defs.'

Unlike a benefit-of-the-bargain case, no\n\n20   specific amount of damages must be proved because, as we have\n\n21   explained at length, damages in this case equal the entire amount\n\n22   of the grant that was lost as a result of the fraud.\n\n23              II.

Br. at 47, \"the\n\n21   Renewal Instructions and the Program Announcement are silent as\n\n22   to what information matters to NIH for purposes of its funding\n\n23   decision.\"    Id. at 52.   The defendants argue in substance that\n\n24   there is no evidence from which the jury could have decided that\n\n\n\n                                       38\n\f 1   the statements it found to be false materially influenced NIH's\n\n 2   decision to renew the T32 grant.8\n\n 3               This argument, however, misapprehends the focus of the\n\n 4   materiality analysis.   In Rogan, the defendant hospital admitted\n\n 5   patients through illegal referrals in violation of the Anti-\n\n 6   Kickback Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1320a-7b.   517 F.3d at 452.   Because of\n\n 7   the violation, the defendant was ineligible to receive Medicare\n\n 8   payments.   The defendant did not deny that it had violated the\n\n 9   Act, but instead argued that its failure to disclose information\n\n10   regarding the illegal referrals was immaterial to the\n\n11   government's decision to approve the hospital's Medicare claims,\n\n12   because materiality could only be established if a government\n\n\n          8\n              The defendants also argue, however, that the district\n     court erred in interpreting NIH's guidelines as \"unambiguous\" --\n     in other words, that to the extent the plaintiff did point to\n     evidence of materiality, that evidence was insufficient to\n     support a jury verdict. Defs. Br. at 52. The defendants note\n     that the renewal application's instructions do not specify what\n     information needs to be included in a progress report, only that\n     the report should include \"difficulties\" with or \"changes\" to a\n     grant program. Id. at 53. The instructions do not explicitly\n     state that grantees must report all changes. Because the NIH\n     guidelines are \"necessarily ambiguous,\" defendants argue that the\n     court cannot rely upon these guidelines as a \"legal standard for\n     materiality.\" Id.\n          But the district court never relied on these guidelines, nor\n     instructed the jury to rely on these guidelines, as a \"standard\n     for materiality.\" The guidelines served instead as evidence that\n     the jury was permitted to rely upon in evaluating what was\n     material to the government in its monitoring of grants.\n     Therefore, we agree with the district court that they provided\n     sufficient evidence from which the jury could reach a conclusion\n     as to materiality. To the extent that these guidelines are\n     ambiguous, it was the jury's function to resolve any disputes\n     about their meaning.\n\n                                      39\n\f 1   employee involved in the decision making process testified that\n\n 2   the government would have terminated payments.   Id.\n\n 3             The court rejected this view of materiality, explaining\n\n 4   that a \"statement or omission is 'capable of influencing' a\n\n 5   decision even if those who make the decision are negligent and\n\n 6   fail to appreciate the statement's significance.\"      Id.   As the\n\n 7   court stated, \"[t]he question is not remotely whether [the\n\n 8   applicant] was sure to be caught . . . but whether the omission\n\n 9   could have influenced the agency's decision.\"    Id.\n\n10             In short, even if a program officer does not\n\n11   subjectively consider a statement to be material, it can be found\n\n12   to be material from an objective standpoint because it is\n\n13   \"capable of influencing\" the program officer.    Id.    As the\n\n14   plaintiff in this case argues, materiality is \"determined not by\n\n15   what a program officer at NIH declares material, but rather [is]\n\n16   based on the agency's own rules and regulations.\"      Pl.'s Br. at\n\n17   48.\n\n18             The Rogan court discussed the purpose of laws\n\n19   prohibiting fraud:\n\n20             Another way to see this is to recognize that\n21             laws against fraud protect the gullible and\n22             the careless -- perhaps especially the\n23             gullible and the careless -- and could not\n24             serve that function if proof of materiality\n25             depended on establishing that the recipient\n26             of the statement would have protected his own\n27             interests.

It does not require evidence\n\n 7   that a program officer relied upon the specific falsehoods proven\n\n 8   to have been false in each case in order for them to be material.\n\n 9   The fact-finder must determine only whether the proven falsehoods\n\n10   have a \"natural tendency to influence, or be capable of\n\n11   influencing, the payment or receipt of money or property.\"   31\n\n12   U.S.C. ยง 3729(b)(4).\n\n13             To decide otherwise โ- that materiality must be\n\n14   established in each case based on the testimony of a\n\n15   decisionmaker โ- would subvert the remedial purpose of the FCA.\n\n16   The resolution of each case would depend on whether such a\n\n17   decisionmaker could be identified and located, and whether that\n\n18   particular person would have treated the claims as material,\n\n19   regardless of whether they were one of several individuals\n\n20   charged with evaluating the claims at issue.\n\n21             The defendants' contention would also render the\n\n22   language of the statute superfluous.   If no one other than an\n\n23   actual decisionmaker could determine whether a statement had a\n\n24   \"natural tendency to influence\" payment, the statute could have\n\n25   provided that a statement is \"material\" if it actually influenced\n\n26   a decision maker who was aware of the statement.\n\n                                    41\n\f 1              Our conclusion finds support in other areas of the law.\n\n 2   In TSC Indus., Inc. v.

And particularly in\n19              view of the prophylactic purpose of the Rule\n20              and the fact that the content of the proxy\n21              statement is within management's control, it\n22              is appropriate that these doubts be resolved\n23              in favor of those the statute is designed to\n24              protect.\n25   Id.\n\n26              The same reasoning applies here.   Like the securities\n\n27   laws at issue in TSC Industries, this objective approach ensures\n\n28   that the FCA serves as a robust prophylactic against fraud by\n\n29   putting the question of materiality to the jury, rather than\n\n30   attempting to trace it back to the state of mind of the\n\n31   decisionmaker.\n\n32              In Bustamante v. First Federal Savings & Loan\n\n33   Association of San Antonio, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1980), the\n\n                                     42\n\f 1   plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the Truth-in-\n\n 2   Lending Act in a loan transaction.     The court noted that\n\n 3                when a security interest [with an exception\n 4                not relevant here] is acquired in real\n 5                property which is the residence of the person\n 6                to whom credit is extended, the borrower has\n 7                a right of rescission within three business\n 8                days of either consummation of the\n 9                transaction or \"the delivery of the\n10                disclosures required under this section and\n11                all other material disclosures required under\n12                this part, whichever is later . . . .\"\n13   Id. at 362.    Here again, the court applied an objective rather\n\n14   than a subjective materiality standard.    \"[T]o apply a subjective\n\n15   standard to the test for materiality would misperceive the\n\n16   remedial purpose of the Act.\"    Id. at 364.   The court concluded\n\n17   that if materiality could be established by a subjective\n\n18   determination of whether or not particular information would\n\n19   affect a credit shopper's decision to utilize the credit,\n\n20   unsophisticated or uneducated consumers would not be sufficiently\n\n21   protected.    Id.\n\n22                Having concluded that the test of materiality in the\n\n23   case before us is objective -- asking what would have influenced\n\n24   the judgment of a reasonable reviewing official -- rather than\n\n25   subjective -- asking whether it influenced the judgment of a\n\n26   reviewer of a proposal in the case at hand -- we agree with the\n\n27   district court that a reasonable jury could have found the\n\n28   defendants' statements to be material to the renewal decisions in\n\n29   the third, fourth, and fifth years of the grant.    Based on the\n\n\n\n                                       43\n\f 1   stipulations regarding criteria relevant to funding and the\n\n 2   testimony at trial, the jury had an ample basis for understanding\n\n 3   the grant process based upon which it could determine whether\n\n 4   statements that were made or omitted concerning changes to\n\n 5   curriculum, personnel and clinical opportunities in the renewal\n\n 6   applications had a \"natural tendency\" to influence NIH's funding\n\n 7   decisions.    The instructions regarding the grant application and\n\n 8   renewal process provided the jury with a clear understanding of\n\n 9   what information the NIH considers in evaluating progress\n\n10   reports, such as changes or developments to the program.\n\n11                The defendants did not inform NIH that not all faculty\n\n12   members identified in the initial grant were \"key personnel\" in\n\n13   the program.    The defendants also failed to inform NIH that\n\n14   several of the core courses listed in the proposed curriculum\n\n15   were never implemented, and that fellows were never evaluated by\n\n16   a training committee.    NIH was not informed that the fellows did\n\n17   not have access to research and clinical resources described in\n\n18   the initial grant application.    NIH was also not aware that the\n\n19   fellows had very limited access to HIV positive patients in their\n\n20   research.    In addition, many of the fellows spent much of their\n\n21   time working on projects unrelated to HIV, such as research into\n\n22   aging and epilepsy, which was not reported to the NIH.    We\n\n23   conclude that these facts were more than sufficient to allow a\n\n24   reasonable jury to conclude that had the facts been disclosed\n\n25   they would have had a natural tendency to influence, or would\n\n                                       44\n\f 1   have been capable of influencing, the decision to renew the grant\n\n 2   and pay money to the defendants pursuant to it.\n\n 3               We therefore also conclude that the district court did\n\n 4   not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial --\n\n 5   the jury's verdict was not \"seriously erroneous\" or \"a\n\n 6   miscarriage of justice.\"    Nimely, 414 F.3d at 392 (internal\n\n 7   quotation marks omitted).\n\n 8               III.   Exclusion of Evidence\n 9                      Demonstrating NIH's Inaction\n\n10               The defendants argue that the district court abused its\n\n11   discretion by excluding evidence of NIH's alleged failure to take\n\n12   remedial action in response to the plaintiff's complaints, and\n\n13   that a new trial is therefore warranted.    We review a district\n\n14   court's decision to exclude evidence for abuse of discretion.\n\n15   Schering Corp. v.

Feldman told NIH about the defendants' fraudulent\n\n24   claims and, according to the defendants, the agency saw no\n\n25   validity to the complaints as evidenced by its failure to take\n\n\n                                       45\n\f 1   action beyond asking Cornell itself to investigate the\n\n 2   complaints.    The defendants argue that they should have been able\n\n 3   to present this evidence to the jury in an effort to persuade it\n\n 4   that the statements had not misled the agency.     If this evidence\n\n 5   was presented, they say, the plaintiff \"could then have put on\n\n 6   any rebuttal evidence about why the jury should find the\n\n 7   statements were false and material despite NIH's lack of reaction\n\n 8   when presented with those allegations.\"     Defs.'

The jury did\n\n15   not have before it the standard that NIH used to determine\n\n16   whether or not action was warranted in response to a funding\n\n17   complaint.    \"[N]o discovery was conducted concerning the\n\n18   standards these agencies employ to determine the existence of\n\n19   misconduct and whether those standards are at all similar to the\n\n20   elements of an FCA claim.\"    Feldman III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2911606</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3,\n\n21   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

Without evidence as to what the\n\n25   standards of the agency were for beginning an investigation, the\n\n                                         46\n\f1   jury could not determine whether the complaints made by Feldman\n\n2   should have instigated one.9   Id., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

While ultimately we would be\n\n7   inclined to agree with the district court, we need go no further\n\n8   in our analysis because the evidence was properly excluded under\n\n\n\n\n         9\n              The defendants point to United States v. Southland\n    Management Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"30540\"><a href=\"/opinion/30540/united-states-v-southland-management/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2003) (en banc), where\n    the court considered the relevance of the course of conduct\n    between a landlord receiving Section 8 funds and HUD. The court\n    concluded that the communication between HUD and the landlord\n    demonstrated that \"HUD was willing to work with the Owners\" on\n    remedying maintenance problems, and that \"HUD seemed to recognize\n    that the property's noncompliance was at least partially\n    explained by a lack of funds and nearby criminal activity.\" Id.\n    at 677. Based in part on this pattern of honest and open\n    communication, the court concluded that there could be no FCA\n    liability. Unlike in Southland Management, there is no\n    indication here that the defendants communicated compliance\n    issues to the government or sought its help in addressing them.\n    Where the government acts in response to potential false claims,\n    its activity may reveal something about its understanding as to\n    whether those claims were deliberately false or the result of\n    extrinsic factors, as in Southland Management. But where, as\n    here, there is no evidence of government action, nothing relevant\n    can be ascertained without knowing for which of many possible\n    reasons it did not act.\n              The defendants also cite United States ex rel.\n    Kreindler & Kreindler v.
