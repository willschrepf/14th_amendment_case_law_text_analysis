The\nspecific question we must resolve is whether invoices for work on currently\npending litigation sent to the County of Los Angeles by an outside law firm are\nwithin the scope of the attorney-client privilege, and therefore exempt from\ndisclosure under the California Public Records Act (PRA; Gov. Code, § 6250 et\nseq.). What we hold is that the attorney-client privilege does not categorically\nshield everything in a billing invoice from PRA disclosure. But invoices for work\nin pending and active legal matters are so closely related to attorney-client\ncommunications that they implicate the heartland of the privilege. The privilege\n\n\n\n                                 SEE DISSENTING OPINION.\n\ftherefore protects the confidentiality of invoices for work in pending and active\nlegal matters.\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n       On July 1, 2013, following several publicized inquiries into allegations of\nexcessive force against inmates housed in the Los Angeles County jail system, the\nACLU of Southern California and Eric Preven (collectively, the ACLU) submitted\na PRA request to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the Office of\nthe Los Angeles County Counsel (collectively, the County). The request sought\n“invoices” specifying the amounts that the County had been billed by any law firm\nin connection with nine different lawsuits alleging excessive force against jail\ninmates.\n       In a letter dated July 26, 2013, the County agreed to produce copies of the\nrequested invoices related to three such lawsuits that were no longer pending, with\nattorney-client privileged and work product information redacted. The County\ndeclined to provide invoices for the remaining six lawsuits, which were still\npending. According to the County, “the detailed description, timing, and amount\nof attorney work performed, which communicates to the client and discloses\nattorney strategy, tactics, thought processes and analysis” were privileged under\nthe Evidence Code and therefore exempt from disclosure under Government Code\nsection 6254, subdivision (k) (all undesignated cites hereafter are to the\nGovernment Code). The requested invoices, the County continued, were also\nexempt under the PRA’s catchall provision, section 6255, subdivision (a),\n“because the public interest served by not disclosing the records at this time\nclearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the records.”\n       On October 31, 2013, the ACLU filed a petition for writ of mandate in the\nsuperior court, seeking to compel the County to “comply with the [PRA]” and\ndisclose the requested records for all nine lawsuits. The ACLU framed its request\n\n                                          2\n\ffor the invoices as follows: “Current and former jail inmates have brought\nnumerous lawsuits against the County and others for alleged excessive force. The\nCounty has retained a number of law firms to defend against these suits. It is\nbelieved that the selected law firms may have engaged in ‘scorched earth’\nlitigation tactics and dragged out cases even when a settlement was in the best\ninterest of the County or when a settlement was likely. Given the issues raised by\nthe allegations in these complaints and the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for the\nalleged use of scorched earth litigation tactics, the public has a right and interest in\nensuring the transparent and efficient use of taxpayer money.” Defending such\nlawsuits, the plaintiffs estimated, could cost tens of millions of dollars. After a\nhearing on June 5, 2014, the court granted the ACLU’s petition. The court held\nthat the County had failed to show the invoices were attorney-client privileged\ncommunications. As a result, the court ordered the County to release “the billing\nstatements for the nine lawsuits identified in the July 1, 2013 []PRA request.” But\n“[t]o the extent these documents reflect an attorney’s legal opinion or advice, or\nreveal an attorney’s mental impressions or theories of the case,” the court held that\n“such limited information may be redacted.”\n       The County then filed its own petition for writ of mandate in the Court of\nAppeal, which granted the County’s petition and vacated the superior court’s\norder. The Court of Appeal found that “the invoices are confidential\ncommunications within the meaning of Evidence Code section 952,” and therefore\n“are exempt from disclosure under Government Code section 6254, subdivision\n(k).” Relying on our decision in Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court (2009)\n47 Cal.4th 725 (Costco), the appellate court concluded that “the proper focus in\nthe privilege inquiry is not whether the communication contains an attorney’s\nopinion or advice, but whether the relationship is one of attorney-client and\nwhether the communication was confidentially transmitted in the course of that\n\n                                           3\n\frelationship.” And “ ‘because the privilege protects a transmission irrespective of\nits content,’ ” the Court of Appeal held that “the invoices” — which “constituted\ninformation transmitted by the law firms to the County in the course of the\nrepresentation” and in confidence — were confidential communications within the\nmeaning of Evidence Code section 952. Given this conclusion, the Court of\nAppeal did not reach the parties’ contentions regarding application of the PRA’s\ncatchall provision or Business and Professions Code sections 6148 and 6149. We\nthen granted review.\n                                  II. DISCUSSION\n       The primary question raised in this case is whether invoices for legal\nservices transmitted to a government agency by outside counsel are categorically\nprotected by the attorney-client privilege and therefore exempt from disclosure\nunder the PRA, and if not, whether any of the information sought by the ACLU is\nnonetheless covered by the privilege.\n\n       A. Statutory Scheme\n\n           1. PRA\n       The PRA and the California Constitution provide the public with a broad\nright of access to government information. (Sierra Club v. Superior Court (2013)\n57 Cal.4th 157, 164.) The PRA, enacted in 1968, grants access to public records\nheld by state and local agencies. (§ 6250 et seq.) Modeled after the federal\nFreedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552 et seq.), the PRA was enacted for the\npurpose of increasing freedom of information by giving members of the public\naccess to records in the possession of state and local agencies. (Filarsky v.\nSuperior Court (2002) 28 Cal.4th 419, 425.) Such “access to information\nconcerning the conduct of the people’s business,” the Legislature declared, “is a\nfundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.” (§ 6250.)\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fConsistent with the Legislature’s purpose, the PRA broadly defines “public\nrecords” to include “any writing containing information relating to the conduct of\nthe public’s business prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local\nagency regardless of physical form or characteristics.” (§ 6252, subd. (e).)\n       As the result of a 2004 initiative, Proposition 59, voters enshrined the\nPRA’s right of access to information in the state Constitution: “The people have\nthe right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business,\nand, therefore, . . . the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to\npublic scrutiny.” (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(1).) As amended by the\ninitiative, the Constitution also directs that statutes “shall be broadly construed if it\nfurthers the people’s right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of\naccess.” (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2).)\n       Despite the value assigned to robust public disclosure of government\nrecords both in the California Constitution and in the PRA, two statutory\nexceptions nonetheless exist. The first is section 6255(a), the PRA’s catchall\nprovision allowing a government agency to withhold a public record if it can\ndemonstrate that “on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by\nnot disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure\nof the record.” In determining the propriety of an agency’s reliance on the catchall\nprovision to withhold public records, the burden of proof is on the agency “to\ndemonstrate a clear overbalance” in favor of nondisclosure. (Michaelis,\nMontanari & Johnson v. Superior Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1065, 1071.) The\nsecond is section 6254, which lists certain categories of records exempt from PRA\ndisclosure. These exemptions are largely concerned with protecting “ ‘the privacy\n\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fof persons whose data or documents come into governmental possession.’ ”\n(Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court (2006) 39 Cal.4th 1272, 1282.)1\n       Section 6254(k) is the PRA exemption at issue in this case. This provision\nallows agencies to withhold “[r]ecords, the disclosure of which is exempted or\nprohibited pursuant to federal or state law, including, but not limited to, provisions\nof the Evidence Code relating to privilege.” (§ 6254(k).)2 By “its reference to the\nprivileges contained in the Evidence Code,” section 6254(k) “has made the\nattorney-client privilege applicable to public records.” (Roberts v. City of\nPalmdale (1993) 5 Cal.4th 363, 370 (Roberts).) This exemption, we have\nexplained, emphasizes the Legislature’s purpose of affording “public entities the\nattorney-client privilege as to writings to the extent authorized by the Evidence\nCode.” (Id. at p. 380, footnote omitted.)\n       As with any of the PRA’s statutory exemptions, “the fact that parts of a\nrequested document fall within the terms of an exemption does not justify\nwithholding the entire document.” (CBS, Inc. v. Block, supra, 42 Cal.3d at\np. 653.) What the PRA appears to offer is a ready solution for records blending\nexempt and nonexempt information: “Any reasonably segregable portion of a\n\n\n1        The 2004 voter initiative preserved these exemptions. (See Cal. Const.,\nart. I, § 3, subd. (b)(5); see also International Federation of Professional and\nTechnical Engineers, Local 21, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 319,\n329, fn. 2.)\n2        As first enacted in 1968, section 6254(k) read: “Records the disclosure of\nwhich is exempted or prohibited pursuant to provisions of federal or state law,\nincluding, but not limited to, provisions of the Evidence Code relating to\nprivilege.” (§ 6254(k), as enacted by Stats. 1968, ch. 1473, § 39, p. 2947.) In\n1981, the Legislature used identical language when repealing and reenacting\nsection 6254(k). (Stats. 1981, ch. 684, §§ 1, 1.5, pp. 2484-2491.) The Legislature\nhas since amended this subdivision only once, deleting the first use of the phrase\n“provisions of” in 1991. (Stats. 1991, ch. 607, § 4, p. 2758.)\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\frecord shall be available for inspection by any person requesting the record after\ndeletion of the portions that are exempted by law.” (§ 6253, subd. (a).) While this\nprovision does not dictate which parts of a public record are privileged, it requires\npublic agencies to use the equivalent of a surgical scalpel to separate those\nportions of a record subject to disclosure from privileged portions. At the same\ntime, the statute places an express limit on this surgical approach: public agencies\nare not required to attempt selective disclosure of records that are not “reasonably\nsegregable.” (Ibid.) To the extent this standard is ambiguous, the PRA must be\nconstrued in “ ‘whichever way will further the people’s right of access.’ ” (Ardon\nv. City of Los Angeles (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1176, 1190; see also Cal. Const., art. I,\n§ 3, subd. (b)(2).)\n\n           2. Evidence Code\n       The attorney-client privilege incorporated into the PRA by section 6254(k)\nis described in Evidence Code section 950 et seq., enacted in 1965. (See Evid.\nCode, div. 8, ch.4, art. 3 [“Lawyer-client Privilege”].) This privilege no doubt\nholds a special place in the law of our state. (See Mitchell v. Superior Court\n(1984) 37 Cal.3d 591, 599 (Mitchell) [“The attorney-client privilege has been a\nhallmark of Anglo-American jurisprudence for almost 400 years.”].) And for\ngood reason: its “fundamental purpose . . . is to safeguard the confidential\nrelationship between clients and their attorneys so as to promote full and frank\ndiscussion of the facts and tactics surrounding individual legal matters.” (Ibid.\n[“the public policy fostered by the privilege seeks to insure ‘the right of every\nperson to freely and fully confer and confide in one having knowledge of the law,\nand skilled in its practice, in order that the former may have adequate advice and a\nproper defense’ ”].)\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f       To this end, Evidence Code section 954 confers a privilege on the client “to\nrefuse to disclose, and to prevent another from disclosing, a confidential\ncommunication between client and lawyer.” A “confidential communication,”\nmoreover, is defined as “information transmitted between a client and his or her\nlawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence by a means which, so\nfar as the client is aware, discloses the information to no third persons other than\nthose who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or\nthose to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the\ninformation or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is\nconsulted, and includes a legal opinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer\nin the course of that relationship.” (Evid. Code, § 952.)\n\n       B. Application to County’s Invoices for Legal Services\n       As with all questions of statutory interpretation, our foremost task is to give\neffect to the Legislature’s purpose. (See Tuolumne Jobs & Small Business\nAlliance v. Superior Court (2014) 59 Cal.4th 1029, 1037.) In doing so, we\nanalyze the statute’s text in its relevant context, as text so read tends to be the\nclearest, most cogent indicator of a specific provision’s purpose in the larger\nstatutory scheme. We interpret relevant terms in light of their ordinary meaning,\nwhile also taking account of any related provisions and the overall structure of the\nstatutory scheme to determine what interpretation best advances the Legislature’s\nunderlying purpose. (See Nahrstedt v. Lakeside Village Condominium Assn.\n(1994) 8 Cal.4th 361, 378.)\n       Not surprisingly, the primary purpose of the Evidence Code provisions at\nissue in this case is to protect the confidential relationship between client and\nattorney to promote frank discussion between the two. (See Mitchell, supra, 37\nCal.3d at p. 599.) These provisions do so by prohibiting disclosure of any\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f“confidential communication between client and lawyer.” (Evid. Code, § 954.)\nThe Evidence Code also states that “ ‘confidential communication between client\nand lawyer’ means information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer\nin the course of that relationship and in confidence . . . , and includes a legal\nopinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer in the course of that\nrelationship.” (Id., § 952; see also Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 733 [“the\nprivilege attaches to any legal advice given in the course of an attorney-client\nrelationship”].) The key question, then, is this: Would treating invoices as\nsometimes nonprivileged undermine the fundamental purpose of the attorney-\nclient privilege?\n       The ACLU says no. Merely sending invoices to a client, the ACLU\ncontends, does not always “further the purpose of legal representation.” Rather,\ninvoices are meant to help a service provider secure payment for services\nrendered. The mere fact that an attorney chose to transmit his or her invoices in\nconfidence is of no moment, according to the ACLU. Such invoices further a\nseparate business purpose that is merely incidental to the attorney-client\nrelationship. We agree –– but only up to a point. The attorney-client privilege\nonly protects communications between attorney and client made for the purpose of\nseeking or delivering the attorney’s legal advice or representation. Evidence Code\nsection 952 twice states that the privilege extends only to those communications\nmade “in the course of [the attorney-client] relationship,” a construction\nsuggesting a nexus between the communication and the attorney’s professional\nrole.3 The Evidence Code also repeatedly refers to “consultation” between the\nattorney and client. (See id., § 951 [defining a “client” as someone who “consults\n\n3     The phrase “in the course of that relationship” has appeared unchanged in\nEvidence Code section 952 since its enactment in 1965.\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fa lawyer for the purpose of retaining the lawyer or securing legal service or advice\nfrom him in his professional capacity”]; id., § 952 [defining “confidential\ncommunication between client and lawyer” as “information transmitted in\nconfidence by a means which . . . discloses to no third persons other than those\nwho are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or to those to\nwhom disclosure is reasonably necessary for . . . the accomplishment of the\npurpose for which the lawyer is consulted”].)\n       These references underscore that the privilege does not apply to every\nsingle communication transmitted confidentially between lawyer and client.\nRather, the heartland of the privilege protects those communications that bear\nsome relationship to the attorney’s provision of legal consultation. (See Roberts,\nsupra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 371 [explaining that “under the Evidence Code, the attorney-\nclient privilege applies to confidential communications within the scope of the\nattorney-client relationship” (italics added)]; see also Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th at\np. 743 (conc. opn. of George, C. J.) [Evid. Code § 952 “identifies a ‘ “confidential\ncommunication” ’ in general terms as meaning ‘information transmitted between a\nclient and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship,’ but the provision\nalso supplies more specific examples of what is meant by adding that a\nconfidential communication ‘includes a legal opinion formed and the advice given\nby the lawyer in the course of that relationship’ ” (italics omitted)].)\n       Justice Werdegar’s dissenting opinion suggests that the Evidence Code’s\ndefinition of the attorney-client privilege forecloses any inquiry into whether a\ncommunication is related to legal consultation. Yet the Evidence Code’s\ndefinition of the privilege concerns not only the manner in which information is\ntransmitted, but the nature of the communication. The statute treats the term\n“confidential communication between client and lawyer” as one that requires\nfurther definition, and the definition it provides extends only to that information\n\n                                          10\n\ftransmitted “in the course of [the attorney-client] relationship.” (Evid. Code, §\n952, italics added.) The same definition also refers to “those who are present to\nfurther the interest of the client in the consultation” and “the accomplishment of\nthe purpose for which the lawyer is consulted. (Ibid., italics added.) A similar\nfocus is plain in related definitions of the Evidence Code. For example, the statute\ndefines “client” as someone who “consults a lawyer for the purpose of retaining\nthe lawyer or securing legal service or advice from him in his professional\ncapacity.” (Id., § 951.) And a “confidential communication between client and\nlawyer,” according to the statute, “includes a legal opinion formed and the advice\ngiven by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.” (Id., § 952.) These\nreferences cut against an understanding of the privilege in this context as\nencompassing every conceivable communication a client and attorney share, and\ninstead link the privilege to communications that bear some relationship to the\nprovision of legal consultation.\n       Invoices for legal services are generally not communicated for the purpose\nof legal consultation. Rather, they are communicated for the purpose of billing the\nclient and, to the extent they have no other purpose or effect, they fall outside the\nscope of an attorney’s professional representation. (See County of Los Angeles v.\nSuperior Court (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 57, 67 [explaining that “the dominant\npurpose for preparing the [invoices to the county] was not for use in litigation but\nas part of normal record keeping and to facilitate the payment of attorney fees on a\nregular basis”]; cf. Montebello Rose Co. v. Agricultural Labor Relations Bd.\n(1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 1, 32 [labor negotiations, which could have been\nconducted by a nonattorney, “were not privileged unless the dominant purpose of\nthe particular communication was to secure or render legal service or advice”].)\nWhile invoices may convey some very general information about the process\nthrough which a client obtains legal advice, their purpose is to ensure proper\n\n                                          11\n\fpayment for services rendered, not to seek or deliver the attorney’s legal advice or\nrepresentation.\n        This distinction is relevant because, as our opinion in Costco confirmed,\nnot every communication between attorney and client is privileged solely because\nit is confidentially transmitted. Costco had retained a law firm to advise it on\nwhether certain managers were exempt from wage and overtime laws. An\nattorney at the firm interviewed two Costco managers and then sent the company a\nconfidential 22-page opinion letter. Several years later, some Costco employees\nfiled a lawsuit claiming that Costco had misclassified and underpaid its managers.\nAs part of that litigation, the plaintiffs tried to compel discovery of the attorney’s\nopinion letter. Over Costco’s objection, the trial court ordered disclosure of the\nletter, allowing portions of it containing the attorney’s impressions, observations,\nand opinions to be redacted. (Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 730-731.) The\nconfidential opinion letter at issue in Costco was indisputably privileged, and the\nplaintiffs never claimed otherwise. (See id. at pp. 735-736 [the plaintiffs “never\ndisputed” that Costco retained the law firm to provide Costco with “legal advice,”\nwhich was provided in the form of the opinion letter].)\n       In ruling that Costco did not need to turn over this opinion letter, we took\ncare to explain that the same rule would not apply to all communications between\na lawyer and his or her client. The privilege, for example, “is not applicable when\nthe attorney acts merely as a negotiator for the client or is providing business\nadvice [citation]; in that case, the relationship between the parties to the\ncommunication is not one of attorney-client.” (Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th at\np. 735.) The same is true when a lawyer is billing his or her client: the\nrelationship evokes an arm’s-length transaction between parties in the market for\nprofessional services more than it does the diligent but discreet conveyance of\nfacts and advice that epitomizes the bond between lawyer and client. An\n\n                                          12\n\forganization may strongly oppose, and sternly resist, public disclosure of its legal\nbills, just as a business adviser or public relations consultant might do the same.\nBut the extent of this resistance does not dictate the scope of the attorney-client\nprivilege.\n       What Costco also reaffirmed is the longstanding principle that “a client\ncannot protect unprivileged information from discovery by transmitting it to an\nattorney,” though we noted that this “concern [was] not present here.” (Costco,\nsupra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 735; see also Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Court (1961) 56\nCal.2d 355, 397 [“ ‘Knowledge which is not otherwise privileged does not become\nso merely by being communicated to an attorney.’ ”].) Costco thus recognized\nthat not all communications between attorney and client become privileged solely\nby virtue of the mode of communication (confidential versus not). And though\nCostco made this point with regard to information sent from client to attorney, we\nsee no reason why the reverse situation would require a different rule. After all, a\nlawyer may well send a government client an e-mail that has nothing to do with\nlegal advice. For example, a lawyer might e-mail details about a firm’s efforts to\nmove to a newly constructed office building or host a political fundraiser. Even if\nthese communications are confidential (as would be true for any e-mail\ncommunication), they are not made for the purpose of legal consultation and are\ntherefore not protected by the attorney-client privilege.\n       The same is true for billing invoices. While a client’s fees have some\nancillary relationship to legal consultation, an invoice listing amounts of fees is\nnot communicated for the purpose of legal consultation. The mere fact that an\nattorney transmitted a communication to his or her client confidentially (in the\nsense that no one other than the recipient could see the communication) does not\nend the inquiry into whether the communication’s contents are protected by the\nattorney-client privilege. After all, just about every communication between a\n\n                                          13\n\flawyer and client is intended to be kept private, regardless of whether the\ncommunication has any connection to legal consultation at all. Even the fact that\nthe information communicated may have some ancillary bearing on an attorney’s\nrelationship to a client (as information about an office move or political fundraiser\nmight have) does not end our inquiry into whether the attorney-client privilege\napplies. Nor does the fact that an attorney would prefer to keep the information\nconfidential (as most people would prefer for their emails).\n       What the inquiry turns on instead is the link between the content of the\ncommunication and the types of communication that the attorney-client privilege\nwas designed to keep confidential. In order for a communication to be privileged,\nit must be made for the purpose of the legal consultation, rather than some\nunrelated or ancillary purpose. As Chief Justice George put it in his concurring\nopinion in Costco: “the communication also must occur ‘in the course of’ the\nattorney-client relationship (Evid. Code, § 952) — that is, the communication\nmust have been made for the purpose of the legal representation.” (Costco, supra,\n47 Cal.4th at p. 742 (conc. opn. of George, C. J.).) Considering Evidence Code\nsection 952 “as a whole,” continued Chief Justice George, it becomes “even\nclearer that the Legislature intended to extend the protection of the privilege solely\nto those communications between the lawyer and the client that are made for the\npurpose of seeking or delivering the lawyer’s legal advice or representation.”\n(Costco, 47 Cal.4th at p. 743 (conc. opn. of George, C. J.).) While Chief Justice\nGeorge’s views are expressed in a concurring opinion, the opinion emphasizes a\ncrucial distinction that is relevant here, between the opinion letter at issue in that\ncase and the invoices at issue here. Unlike an opinion letter, a billing invoice is\nnot “made for the purpose of the legal representation.” (Id. at p. 742.)\n       But while billing invoices are generally not “made for the purpose of legal\nrepresentation,” the information contained within certain invoices may be within\n\n                                           14\n\fthe scope of the privilege. To the extent that billing information is conveyed “for\nthe purpose of legal representation” –– perhaps to inform the client of the nature or\namount of work occurring in connection with a pending legal issue –– such\ninformation lies in the heartland of the attorney-client privilege. And even if the\ninformation is more general, such as aggregate figures describing the total amount\nspent on continuing litigation during a given quarter or year, it may come close\nenough to this heartland to threaten the confidentiality of information directly\nrelevant to the attorney’s distinctive professional role. The attorney-client\nprivilege protects the confidentiality of information in both those categories, even\nif the information happens to be transmitted in a document that is not itself\ncategorically privileged. When a legal matter remains pending and active, the\nprivilege encompasses everything in an invoice, including the amount of aggregate\nfees. This is because, even though the amount of money paid for legal services is\ngenerally not privileged, an invoice that shows a sudden uptick in spending “might\nvery well reveal much of [a government agency]’s investigative efforts and trial\nstrategy.” (Mitchell, supra, 37 Cal.3d at p. 610.) Midlitigation swings in\nspending, for example, could reveal an impending filing or outsized concern about\na recent event.\n       The same may not be true for fee totals in legal matters that concluded long\nago. In contrast to information involving a pending case, a cumulative fee total for\na long-completed matter does not always reveal the substance of legal\nconsultation. The fact that the amounts in both cases were communicated in an\ninvoice transmitted confidentially from lawyer to client does not automatically\nmake this information privileged. Instead, the privilege turns on whether those\namounts reveal anything about legal consultation. Asking an agency to disclose\nthe cumulative amount it spent on long-concluded litigation –– with no ongoing\nlitigation to shed light on the context from which such records are arising –– may\n\n                                         15\n\fcommunicate little or nothing about the substance of legal consultation. But when\nthose same cumulative totals are communicated during ongoing litigation, this\nreal-time disclosure of ongoing spending amounts can indirectly reveal clues about\nlegal strategy, especially when multiple amounts over time are compared.\n       Justice Werdegar is concerned that our opinion suggests the “scope of the\nprivilege somehow wanes with the termination of the subject litigation.” But the\nquestion at issue here is not, as Justice Werdegar suggests, whether privileged\nmaterial remains privileged when “the attorney-client relationship has ended.”\n(Dis. opn., post, at p. 7.) Even while the scope of the attorney-client privilege\nremains constant over time, the same information (for example, the cumulative\namount of money that was spent on a case) takes on a different significance if it is\nrevealed during the course of active litigation. During active litigation, that\ninformation can threaten the confidentiality of legal consultation by revealing legal\nstrategy. But there may come a point when this very same information no longer\ncommunicates anything privileged, because it no longer provides any insight into\nlitigation strategy or legal consultation.\n       Our conclusion that the privilege turns on content and purpose, not form,\nfits not only with the terms of the statute but also the law as it existed before the\nEvidence Code was enacted. The Evidence Code was meant to incorporate prior\nlaw on the attorney-client privilege. (See Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B\npt. 3A West’s Ann. Evid. Code (2009 ed.) foll. § 952, p. 307 [“The requirement\nthat the communication be made in the course of the lawyer-client relationship and\nbe confidential is in accord with existing law.”].) Before 1965, the long-\nestablished rule in California was that the attorney-client privilege — then set\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\fforth in the Code of Civil Procedure4 — protected communications made for the\npurpose of the attorney’s professional representation. (See, e.g., Solon v.\nLichtenstein (1952) 39 Cal.2d 75, 80 [“A communication to be privileged must\nhave been made to an attorney acting in his professional capacity toward his\nclient.”].)\n       Further support for this conclusion comes from the language and structure\nof a related statutory scheme. Business and Professions Code section 6148,\nsubdivision (a), describes the information that a contract for legal services (i.e., a\nfee agreement) must generally contain. Subdivision (b), on the other hand,\ndescribes the information that attorney billing statements (such as invoices) must\ngenerally contain. (See id., § 6148, subd. (b).) But Business and Professions\nCode section 6149 states that only fee agreements “shall be deemed to be a\nconfidential communication within the meaning of . . . Section 952 of the\nEvidence Code.” This section makes no mention of billing statements or invoices.\nThe Legislature’s decision to define both fee agreements and billing statements in\none section, while in the very next section subjecting only the former to the\nattorney-client privilege, suggests that the privilege was not intended to protect\nboth fee agreements and invoices in the exact same way. (See Pasadena Police\nOfficers Assn. v. City of Pasadena (1990) 51 Cal.3d 564, 576 [“When the\n\n\n\n\n4      “An attorney cannot, without the consent of his client, be examined as to\nany communication made by the client to him, or his advice given thereon in the\ncourse of professional employment.” (Code Civ. Proc., former § 1881, subd. 2,\nenacted in 1872 and repealed by Stats. 1965, ch. 299, § 2, p. 1297 [enacting Evid.\nCode].)\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\fLegislature ‘has employed a term or phrase in one place and excluded it in\nanother, it should not be implied where excluded.’ ”].)5\n       These arguments help explain why California courts have generally\npresumed that invoices for legal services are not categorically privileged. (See,\ne.g., Concepcion v. Amscan Holdings, Inc. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1326-\n1327 [“we seriously doubt that all — or even most — of the information on each\nof the billing records proffered to the court was privileged”].) Indeed, disclosure\nof billing invoices is the norm in the federal courts in California, where “[f]ee\ninformation is generally not privileged.” (Federal Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp. v. Ferm\n(9th Cir. 1990) 909 F.2d 372, 374; see also Tornay v. U.S. (9th Cir. 1988) 840\nF.2d 1424, 1426 [“Payment of fees is incidental to the attorney-client relationship,\nand does not usually involve disclosure of confidential communications arising\nfrom the professional relationship.”].) Our holding today is consistent with that\napproach — an approach with which the County, a frequent litigant in federal\ncourt, is undoubtedly familiar.\n       None of the County’s remaining arguments supports the conclusion that all\ninformation in attorney invoices is categorically privileged. In particular, the\nCounty observes that disclosure of invoices can provide adversaries a window into\nlitigation strategies — “a road map as to how the matter is being litigated, or may\nbe litigated in the future.” We are sensitive to the County’s concern here, but this\nconcern does not require the rule that Court of Appeal established and that the\n\n\n5       The reason for this discrepancy, according to the County, is that invoices\n“so obviously met [Evidence Code section 952’s] definition of communications”\nthat the Legislature saw no need to specify that they were privileged. We are not\nconvinced. As explained above, we do not think Evidence Code section 952\ncategorically protects invoices. And, in any event, whether it does is far from\n“obvious[].”\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fCounty insists on, which is a categorical bar on disclosure of a government\nagency’s expenditures for any legal matter, past or present, active or inactive, open\nor closed. Though the PRA carves out an exemption for privileged portions of\ngovernment records, “[t]he fact that parts of a requested document fall within the\nterms of an exemption does not justify withholding the entire document.” (CBS,\nInc. v. Block, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 653.) Instead, government agencies must\ndisclose “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion” of a public record “after deletion of\nthe portions that are exempted by law.” (§ 6253, subd. (a).)\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f                                 III. CONCLUSION\n       The imperative of protecting privileged communications between attorney\nand client –– and thereby promoting full and frank discussion between them –– is\na defining feature of our law. This imperative does not require us to conclude —\nas the Court of Appeal did here — that everything in a public agency’s invoices\nfor legal services is categorically privileged. Instead, the contents of an invoice\nare privileged only if they either communicate information for the purpose of legal\nconsultation or risk exposing information that was communicated for such a\npurpose. This latter category includes any invoice that reflects work in active and\nongoing litigation. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal\nand remand for proceedings consistent with our opinion.\n                                                  CUÉLLAR, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCHIN, J.\nLIU, J.\nKRUGER, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f                 DISSENTING OPINION BY WERDEGAR, J.\n\n       The importance of the attorney-client evidentiary privilege to the proper\nfunctioning of the legal system in this state cannot be overstated. “The attorney-\nclient privilege has been a hallmark of Anglo-American jurisprudence for almost\n400 years. [Citations.] The privilege authorizes a client to refuse to disclose, and\nto prevent others from disclosing, confidential communications between attorney\nand client. (Evid. Code, § 950 et seq.) Clearly, the fundamental purpose behind\nthe privilege is to safeguard the confidential relationship between clients and their\nattorneys so as to promote full and open discussion of the facts and tactics\nsurrounding individual legal matters. [Citation.] In other words, the public policy\nfostered by the privilege seeks to insure ‘the right of every person to freely and\nfully confer and confide in one having knowledge of the law, and skilled in its\npractice, in order that the former may have adequate advice and a proper\ndefense.’ ” (Mitchell v. Superior Court (1984) 37 Cal.3d 591, 599, fn. omitted.)\n“Although exercise of the privilege may occasionally result in the suppression of\nrelevant evidence, the Legislature of this state has determined that these concerns\nare outweighed by the importance of preserving confidentiality in the attorney-\nclient relationship.” (Ibid.)\n       With today’s decision, a majority of the court undermines this pillar of our\njurisprudence, finding legal invoices sent from a law firm to its client, although\n\finitially protected by the attorney-client privilege, may lose such protection once\nthe subject litigation is concluded. This conclusion finds no support in the plain\nmeaning of the words of the attorney-client privilege as set forth in Evidence Code\nsection 954,1 and are in fact contrary to a recent decision by this court interpreting\nthe scope of the privilege. I respectfully dissent.\n                                           I.\n       The attorney-client privilege is set forth in section 954 and provides in\npertinent part that a “client, whether or not a party, has a privilege to refuse to\ndisclose, and to prevent another from disclosing, a confidential communication\nbetween client and lawyer . . . .” The phrase “ ‘confidential communication\nbetween client and lawyer’ ” is, as relevant here, defined in section 952 as\n“information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of\nthat relationship and in confidence . . . and includes a legal opinion formed and the\nadvice given by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.” No question exists\nthat the invoices at issue in this case comprise “information transmitted” between\na law firm and its client, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors,2 that the\n\n\n1      All statutory references are to the Evidence Code unless otherwise stated.\n2       Although we may presume for purposes of argument the fee invoices\nconsidered here do not include a “legal opinion formed” or “advice given” within\nthe course of that relationship, section 952’s use of the term “includes” means that\nthe scope of the privilege is not limited to legal opinions and advice. “ ‘[I]ncludes’\n[is] ordinarily a term of enlargement rather than limitation.” (Ornelas v. Randolph\n(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1095, 1101.) “The ‘statutory definition of a thing as “including”\ncertain things does not necessarily place thereon a meaning limited to the\ninclusions.’ ” (Flanagan v. Flanagan (2002) 27 Cal.4th 766, 774.) The majority\ndoes not dispute that the attorney-client privilege covers more than just legal\nopinions and advice, but nevertheless asserts language in various sub-clauses of\nsection 952 mean the attorney-client privilege covers only “communications that\nbear some relationship to the provision of legal consultation.” (Maj. opn., ante,\n                                                            (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                           2\n\finformation was generated within the course of the attorney-client relationship,\nand that the invoices were prepared and transmitted in confidence. As such, the\ninvoices are privileged, and thus not subject to disclosure under the Public\nRecords Act. (Gov. Code, § 6254, subd. (k).)3\n        The majority reaches a different conclusion by embellishing the words of\nthe statutory privilege to discover a heretofore hidden meaning. According to the\nmajority, the “key question” is: “Would treating invoices as sometimes\nnonprivileged undermine the fundamental purpose of the attorney-client\nprivilege?” (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 9, italics added.) The opinion then reasons the\nprivilege protects only those “communications between attorney and client made\nfor the purpose of seeking or delivering the attorney’s legal advice or\nrepresentation.” (Ibid., italics added.) Therefore, concludes the majority, “the\nprivilege does not apply to every single communication transmitted confidentially\nbetween lawyer and client. Rather, the heartland of the privilege protects those\ncommunications that bear some relationship to the attorney’s provision of legal\nconsultation.” (Id. at p. 10, italics added.)\n\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\np. 10.) As I explain, post, this interpretation of sections 954 and 952 is far too\nnarrow and contrary to existing authority.\n3      Government Code section 6254, subdivision (k) states that the Public\nRecords Act does not require disclosure of the following records: “Records, the\ndisclosure of which is exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law,\nincluding, but not limited to, provisions of the Evidence Code relating to\nprivilege.” (Italics added.) “By its reference to the privileges contained in the\nEvidence Code, therefore, the Public Records Act has made the attorney-client\nprivilege applicable to public records.” (Roberts v. City of Palmdale (1993) 5\nCal.4th 363, 370.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f       The majority’s decision to add consideration of a communication’s purpose\nas an additional, nonstatutory element to the Legislature’s definition of a\n“confidential communication” is unsupported in law. Absent those rare situations\nin which the attorney-client privilege facilitates a person’s constitutional rights\nunder the Sixth Amendment,4 the evidentiary privilege at issue in this case is\nstatutory only. As we have recognized, “[o]ur deference to the Legislature is\nparticularly necessary when we are called upon to interpret the attorney-client\nprivilege, because the Legislature has determined that evidentiary privileges shall\nbe available only as defined by statute. (Evid. Code, § 911.) Courts may not add\nto the statutory privileges except as required by state or federal constitutional law\n[citations], nor may courts imply unwritten exceptions to existing statutory\nprivileges.” (Roberts v. City of Palmdale, supra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 373, italics\nadded.) As the California Law Revision Commission has commented, “privileges\nare not recognized in the absence of statute,” and “[t]his is one of the few\ninstances where the Evidence Code precludes the courts from elaborating upon the\nstatutory scheme.” (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B pt. 3A West’s Ann. Evid.\nCode, foll. § 911, at p. 219.)\n       This court recently spoke to the scope of the attorney-client privilege in\nCostco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725 (Costco). In\nCostco, the issue, as in the instant case, concerned a communication between a\nlawyer and client that arguably contained both confidential information (in the\nform of legal opinions) and nonconfidential information (such as facts obtained\n\n\n4      See, e.g., Barber v. Municipal Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 742, 751 (“if an\naccused is to derive the full benefits of his [constitutional] right to counsel, he\nmust have the assurance of confidentiality and privacy of communication with his\nattorney”), relying on Fisher v. United States (1976) 425 U.S. 391, 403.\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\ffrom witnesses). The Costco plaintiffs contended they were entitled to discovery\nof the nonprivileged portions of a letter legal counsel sent to the defendant.\nInterpreting sections 952 and 954, this court unanimously rejected the claim,\nexplaining that “[t]he attorney-client privilege attaches to a confidential\ncommunication between the attorney and the client and bars discovery of the\ncommunication irrespective of whether it includes unprivileged material. As we\nexplained in Mitchell v. Superior Court, supra, 37 Cal.3d at page 600: ‘[T]he\nprivilege covers the transmission of documents which are available to the public,\nand not merely information in the sole possession of the attorney or client. In this\nregard, it is the actual fact of the transmission which merits protection, since\ndiscovery of the transmission of specific public documents might very well reveal\nthe transmitter’s intended strategy.’ ” (Costco, supra, at p. 734, italics added.)\nFurther, “ ‘[n]either the statutes articulating the attorney-client privilege nor the\ncases which have interpreted it make any differentiation between “factual” and\n“legal” information.’ ” (Ibid.)\n       The majority seemingly embraces the notion that courts may parse a legal\ncommunication to permit disclosure of those parts that were not “made for the\npurpose of legal consultation” (maj. opn., ante, at p. 13), but strains to distinguish\nCostco, supra, 47 Cal.4th 725, unconvincingly suggesting that when an attorney\nbills a client for legal services rendered, he or she steps outside the role of a\nlawyer and into the role of accountant. (Maj. opn., ante, p. 12 [“the relationship\nevokes an arm’s-length transaction between parties in the market for professional\nservices more than it does the diligent but discreet conveyance of facts and advice\nthat epitomizes the bond between lawyer and client”].) Accordingly, reasons the\nmajority, legal billing invoices may fall outside the protection of the attorney-\nclient privilege because they “are not made for the purpose of legal consultation.”\n(Id., at p. 13.) But this is not a situation in which an attorney is acting as\n\n                                           5\n\fsomething other than a legal representative, such as a real estate agent or business\nadvisor; the invoice in question was for legal services rendered.\n       More to the point, the majority’s line of analysis ignores the core reasoning\nof Costco that section 954 prohibits courts from parsing a communication between\nlawyer and client in order that those parts not involving a legal opinion or advice\ncan be disclosed. As Costco explained, despite what might be the dominant\npurpose of a communication, “when the communication is a confidential one\nbetween attorney and client, the entire communication, including its recitation or\nsummary of factual material, is privileged.” (Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 736,\nitalics added.) Costco’s analysis, applied here, leads inexorably to the conclusion\nthat the legal invoices at issue are privileged under sections 952 and 954.5\n       Even more pernicious than the majority’s improper addition of a\nnonstatutory prerequisite to the attorney-client privilege, and its unconvincing\nattempt to distinguish Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th 725, is its suggestion that the\nprotective scope of the privilege somehow wanes with the termination of the\nsubject litigation. Thus, the majority opines that “[w]hen a legal matter remains\npending and active, the privilege encompasses everything in an invoice—\n\n\n5       To the extent the majority relies on former Chief Justice George’s\nconcurring opinion in Costco (maj. opn, ante, at pp. 13–14), it mischaracterizes his\nviews. (Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 741–744 conc. opn. of George, C. J.). In\na separate opinion, former Chief Justice George distinguished the situation in\nwhich information is transmitted between the client and the lawyer in the course of\nthe attorney-client relationship, which information is privileged, from the situation\nin which information is communicated to an attorney outside the context of an\nattorney-client relationship, which information is unprivileged. “[A]\ncommunication in the context of section 952 need not concern litigation; rather it\nsuffices that the communication consist of information transmitted between the\nclient and the lawyer within the scope of the attorney-client relationship.” (Id. at\np. 743 (conc. opn. of George, C. J.).)\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fincluding the amount of aggregate fees.” (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 15.) But the\nmajority then suggests a more limited rule of privilege may apply once the\nlitigation ends, saying that “[t]he same may not be true for fee totals in legal\nmatters that concluded long ago.” (Ibid.) That the majority fails to cite any\nlanguage in sections 952 or 954 supporting such a rule is unsurprising, for nothing\nin the Evidence Code supports the notion that the reach of the attorney-client\nprivilege is different for pending litigation versus legal matters that have\nconcluded.\n       Indeed, legal authority is to the contrary. In Littlefield v. Superior Court\n(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 477, a defendant in a criminal case sought a writ of\nmandate to force his codefendant to testify and reveal confidential conversations\nhe had with his lawyer, the Los Angeles County Public Defender. (It was the\ndefendant’s contention the public defender had disclosed facts about the alleged\nmurders to the codefendant, which allowed him to fabricate testimony detrimental\nto the defendant.) Although the defendant acknowledged the communications\nwere presumptively protected by the attorney-client privilege, he argued “that\nprivilege may be deemed attenuated because the attorney/client relationship is\n‘near an end.’ ” (Id. at p. 481.) The appellate court properly disagreed, explaining\nthat “the attorney/client privilege continues even after the end of threat of\npunishment” (id. at p. 482), and that “[n]othing in the statutes controlling the\nprivilege suggests it is to be limited or diminished in importance as a function of\nthe continuance of the relationship that existed at the time of the confidential\ncommunications herein sought” (ibid.). In other words, the protective power of\nthe attorney-client privilege is not reduced simply because the attorney-client\nrelationship has ended or is about to end. (Cf. HLC Properties, Ltd. v. Superior\nCourt (2005) 35 Cal.4th 54, 66 [attorney-client privilege continues to protect\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fcovered communications until no person or entity exists who is statutorily\nauthorized to assert it].)\n       Secondary sources are even more pointed. The attorney-client privilege\n“attaches upon the initial consultation . . . and continues beyond the end of the\nattorney-client relationship for so long as a ‘holder’ is in existence.” (Vapnek et\nal., Cal. Practice Guide: Professional Responsibility (The Rutter Group 2003)\n¶ 7:265, p. 7–114 (Aug. 2016 Update).) “The right to claim the attorney-client\nprivilege is not limited to the litigation or controversy in the course of which a\nprotected communication was made. It survives the termination of litigation and\ncontinues even after the threat of liability or punishment has passed.” (Id.,\n¶ 7:269, p. 7–115, italics added.)\n       The majority’s suggestion the protective power of the attorney-client\nprivilege under section 954 “may not” (maj. opn., ante, at p. 15) continue to\nencompass all portions of a document that previously qualified as a “confidential\ncommunication” under section 952 is mischievous in the extreme. Following\ntoday’s decision, attorneys in this state must counsel their clients that confidential\ncommunications between lawyer and client, previously protected by the attorney-\nclient privilege, may be forced into the open by interested parties once the subject\nlitigation has concluded. If a limiting principle applies to this new rule, it is not\nperceptible to me.6\n\n6       The majority confusingly asserts “the scope of the attorney-client privilege\nremains constant over time,” but that, after an undetermined period of time,\nprivileged “information . . . takes on a different significance” (maj. opn., ante,\np. 16, italics added), such that it can lose its confidential status. But if the scope of\nthe privilege is constant over time, how information—once privileged—\nnevertheless loses its protected status is unexplained by the majority. If the\nmajority is saying that a court may refuse to recognize the privileged status of\nonce-privileged information if it determines the information is no longer of\n                                                             (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                           8\n\f        Nor is it any saving grace that “disclosure of billing invoices is the norm in\nthe federal courts in California, where ‘[f]ee information is generally not\nprivileged.’ ” (Maj. opn, ante, at p. 18.) Although by this argument the majority\nsuggests that a strong weight of legal opinion backing its views exists in the\nfederal universe, such support is ephemeral. The cases cited by the majority rely\non Federal Rule of Evidence 501, which simply incorporates federal common\nlaw.7 By contrast, the scope of the attorney-client privilege in California state\ncourts is governed by the detailed and specific definition of a “confidential\ncommunication” as set forth in section 952. The majority’s comparison of apples\nto oranges is thus unpersuasive.\n                                          II.\n        As noted above, the conclusion reached by the majority today is\ninconsistent with our interpretation of section 952 in Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th\n725. But even setting Costco aside, this court is simply not free to add elements\nand prerequisites to a statutory rule of evidentiary privilege. Whether it might be\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nstrategic value to a litigant, I disagree, and further observe the majority cites no\nauthority for this remarkable position.\n\n7       Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (28 U.S.C.) states in pertinent\npart: “The common law—as interpreted by United States courts in the light of\nreason and experience—governs a claim of privilege unless any of the following\nprovides otherwise:\n  • the United States Constitution;\n  • a federal statute; or\n  • rules prescribed by the Supreme Court.”\n        But the same rule goes on to suggest the primacy of state law rules of\nprivilege, providing that, “in a civil case, state law governs privilege regarding a\nclaim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision.” (Ibid., italics\nadded.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fwise policy to find a “confidential communication” within the meaning of section\n952 must be one “made for the purpose of seeking or delivering the attorney’s\nlegal advice or representation” (maj. opn., ante, at p. 9), is a question more\nproperly consigned to the discretion of the Legislature and not this court.\n       I dissent.\n                                                  WERDEGAR, J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.

The\nspecific question we must resolve is whether invoices for work on currently\npending litigation sent to the County of Los Angeles by an outside law firm are\nwithin the scope of the attorney-client privilege, and therefore exempt from\ndisclosure under the California Public Records Act (PRA; Gov. Code, § 6250 et\nseq.). What we hold is that the attorney-client privilege does not categorically\nshield everything in a billing invoice from PRA disclosure. But invoices for work\nin pending and active legal matters are so closely related to attorney-client\ncommunications that they implicate the heartland of the privilege. The privilege\n\n\n\n                                 SEE DISSENTING OPINION.\n\ftherefore protects the confidentiality of invoices for work in pending and active\nlegal matters.\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n       On July 1, 2013, following several publicized inquiries into allegations of\nexcessive force against inmates housed in the Los Angeles County jail system, the\nACLU of Southern California and Eric Preven (collectively, the ACLU) submitted\na PRA request to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the Office of\nthe Los Angeles County Counsel (collectively, the County). The request sought\n“invoices” specifying the amounts that the County had been billed by any law firm\nin connection with nine different lawsuits alleging excessive force against jail\ninmates.\n       In a letter dated July 26, 2013, the County agreed to produce copies of the\nrequested invoices related to three such lawsuits that were no longer pending, with\nattorney-client privileged and work product information redacted. The County\ndeclined to provide invoices for the remaining six lawsuits, which were still\npending. According to the County, “the detailed description, timing, and amount\nof attorney work performed, which communicates to the client and discloses\nattorney strategy, tactics, thought processes and analysis” were privileged under\nthe Evidence Code and therefore exempt from disclosure under Government Code\nsection 6254, subdivision (k) (all undesignated cites hereafter are to the\nGovernment Code). The requested invoices, the County continued, were also\nexempt under the PRA’s catchall provision, section 6255, subdivision (a),\n“because the public interest served by not disclosing the records at this time\nclearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the records.”\n       On October 31, 2013, the ACLU filed a petition for writ of mandate in the\nsuperior court, seeking to compel the County to “comply with the [PRA]” and\ndisclose the requested records for all nine lawsuits. The ACLU framed its request\n\n                                          2\n\ffor the invoices as follows: “Current and former jail inmates have brought\nnumerous lawsuits against the County and others for alleged excessive force. The\nCounty has retained a number of law firms to defend against these suits. It is\nbelieved that the selected law firms may have engaged in ‘scorched earth’\nlitigation tactics and dragged out cases even when a settlement was in the best\ninterest of the County or when a settlement was likely. Given the issues raised by\nthe allegations in these complaints and the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for the\nalleged use of scorched earth litigation tactics, the public has a right and interest in\nensuring the transparent and efficient use of taxpayer money.” Defending such\nlawsuits, the plaintiffs estimated, could cost tens of millions of dollars. After a\nhearing on June 5, 2014, the court granted the ACLU’s petition. The court held\nthat the County had failed to show the invoices were attorney-client privileged\ncommunications. As a result, the court ordered the County to release “the billing\nstatements for the nine lawsuits identified in the July 1, 2013 []PRA request.” But\n“[t]o the extent these documents reflect an attorney’s legal opinion or advice, or\nreveal an attorney’s mental impressions or theories of the case,” the court held that\n“such limited information may be redacted.”\n       The County then filed its own petition for writ of mandate in the Court of\nAppeal, which granted the County’s petition and vacated the superior court’s\norder. The Court of Appeal found that “the invoices are confidential\ncommunications within the meaning of Evidence Code section 952,” and therefore\n“are exempt from disclosure under Government Code section 6254, subdivision\n(k).” Relying on our decision in Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court (2009)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Costco), the appellate court concluded that “the proper focus in\nthe privilege inquiry is not whether the communication contains an attorney’s\nopinion or advice, but whether the relationship is one of attorney-client and\nwhether the communication was confidentially transmitted in the course of that\n\n                                           3\n\frelationship.” And “ ‘because the privilege protects a transmission irrespective of\nits content,’ ” the Court of Appeal held that “the invoices” — which “constituted\ninformation transmitted by the law firms to the County in the course of the\nrepresentation” and in confidence — were confidential communications within the\nmeaning of Evidence Code section 952. Given this conclusion, the Court of\nAppeal did not reach the parties’ contentions regarding application of the PRA’s\ncatchall provision or Business and Professions Code sections 6148 and 6149. We\nthen granted review.\n                                  II. DISCUSSION\n       The primary question raised in this case is whether invoices for legal\nservices transmitted to a government agency by outside counsel are categorically\nprotected by the attorney-client privilege and therefore exempt from disclosure\nunder the PRA, and if not, whether any of the information sought by the ACLU is\nnonetheless covered by the privilege.\n\n       A. Statutory Scheme\n\n           1. PRA\n       The PRA and the California Constitution provide the public with a broad\nright of access to government information. (Sierra Club v. Superior Court (2013)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 164.) The PRA, enacted in 1968, grants access to public records\nheld by state and local agencies. (§ 6250 et seq.) Modeled after the federal\nFreedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552 et seq.), the PRA was enacted for the\npurpose of increasing freedom of information by giving members of the public\naccess to records in the possession of state and local agencies. (Filarsky v.\nSuperior Court (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2632342\"><a href=\"/opinion/2632342/filarsky-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425.) Such “access to information\nconcerning the conduct of the people’s business,” the Legislature declared, “is a\nfundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.” (§ 6250.)\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fConsistent with the Legislature’s purpose, the PRA broadly defines “public\nrecords” to include “any writing containing information relating to the conduct of\nthe public’s business prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local\nagency regardless of physical form or characteristics.” (§ 6252, subd. (e).)\n       As the result of a 2004 initiative, Proposition 59, voters enshrined the\nPRA’s right of access to information in the state Constitution: “The people have\nthe right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business,\nand, therefore, . . . the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to\npublic scrutiny.” (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(1).) As amended by the\ninitiative, the Constitution also directs that statutes “shall be broadly construed if it\nfurthers the people’s right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of\naccess.” (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2).)\n       Despite the value assigned to robust public disclosure of government\nrecords both in the California Constitution and in the PRA, two statutory\nexceptions nonetheless exist. The first is section 6255(a), the PRA’s catchall\nprovision allowing a government agency to withhold a public record if it can\ndemonstrate that “on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by\nnot disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure\nof the record.” In determining the propriety of an agency’s reliance on the catchall\nprovision to withhold public records, the burden of proof is on the agency “to\ndemonstrate a clear overbalance” in favor of nondisclosure. (Michaelis,\nMontanari & Johnson v. Superior Court (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2575408\"><a href=\"/opinion/2575408/michaelis-montanari-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1065</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1071.) The\nsecond is section 6254, which lists certain categories of records exempt from PRA\ndisclosure. These exemptions are largely concerned with protecting “ ‘the privacy\n\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fof persons whose data or documents come into governmental possession.’ ”\n(Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633606\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633606/copley-press-inc-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1282.)1\n       Section 6254(k) is the PRA exemption at issue in this case. This provision\nallows agencies to withhold “[r]ecords, the disclosure of which is exempted or\nprohibited pursuant to federal or state law, including, but not limited to, provisions\nof the Evidence Code relating to privilege.” (§ 6254(k).)2 By “its reference to the\nprivileges contained in the Evidence Code,” section 6254(k) “has made the\nattorney-client privilege applicable to public records.” (Roberts v. City of\nPalmdale (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1245018\"><a href=\"/opinion/1245018/roberts-v-city-of-palmdale/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370 (Roberts).) This exemption, we have\nexplained, emphasizes the Legislature’s purpose of affording “public entities the\nattorney-client privilege as to writings to the extent authorized by the Evidence\nCode.” (Id. at p. 380, footnote omitted.)\n       As with any of the PRA’s statutory exemptions, “the fact that parts of a\nrequested document fall within the terms of an exemption does not justify\nwithholding the entire document.” (CBS, Inc. v. Block, supra, 42 Cal.3d at\np. 653.) What the PRA appears to offer is a ready solution for records blending\nexempt and nonexempt information: “Any reasonably segregable portion of a\n\n\n1        The 2004 voter initiative preserved these exemptions. (See Cal. Const.,\nart. I, § 3, subd. (b)(5); see also International Federation of Professional and\nTechnical Engineers, Local 21, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2518991\"><a href=\"/opinion/2518991/international-federation-of-professional-and-technical-engineers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n329, fn. 2.)\n2        As first enacted in 1968, section 6254(k) read: “Records the disclosure of\nwhich is exempted or prohibited pursuant to provisions of federal or state law,\nincluding, but not limited to, provisions of the Evidence Code relating to\nprivilege.” (§ 6254(k), as enacted by Stats. 1968, ch. 1473, § 39, p. 2947.) In\n1981, the Legislature used identical language when repealing and reenacting\nsection 6254(k). (Stats. 1981, ch. 684, §§ 1, 1.5, pp. 2484-2491.) The Legislature\nhas since amended this subdivision only once, deleting the first use of the phrase\n“provisions of” in 1991. (Stats. 1991, ch. 607, § 4, p. 2758.)\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\frecord shall be available for inspection by any person requesting the record after\ndeletion of the portions that are exempted by law.” (§ 6253, subd. (a).) While this\nprovision does not dictate which parts of a public record are privileged, it requires\npublic agencies to use the equivalent of a surgical scalpel to separate those\nportions of a record subject to disclosure from privileged portions. At the same\ntime, the statute places an express limit on this surgical approach: public agencies\nare not required to attempt selective disclosure of records that are not “reasonably\nsegregable.” (Ibid.) To the extent this standard is ambiguous, the PRA must be\nconstrued in “ ‘whichever way will further the people’s right of access.’ ” (Ardon\nv. City of Los Angeles (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1176</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1190; see also Cal. Const., art. I,\n§ 3, subd. (b)(2).)\n\n           2. Evidence Code\n       The attorney-client privilege incorporated into the PRA by section 6254(k)\nis described in Evidence Code section 950 et seq., enacted in 1965. (See Evid.\nCode, div. 8, ch.4, art. 3 [“Lawyer-client Privilege”].) This privilege no doubt\nholds a special place in the law of our state. (See Mitchell v. Superior Court\n(1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1408972\"><a href=\"/opinion/1408972/mitchell-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 599 (Mitchell) [“The attorney-client privilege has been a\nhallmark of Anglo-American jurisprudence for almost 400 years.”].) And for\ngood reason: its “fundamental purpose . . . is to safeguard the confidential\nrelationship between clients and their attorneys so as to promote full and frank\ndiscussion of the facts and tactics surrounding individual legal matters.” (Ibid.\n[“the public policy fostered by the privilege seeks to insure ‘the right of every\nperson to freely and fully confer and confide in one having knowledge of the law,\nand skilled in its practice, in order that the former may have adequate advice and a\nproper defense’ ”].)\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f       To this end, Evidence Code section 954 confers a privilege on the client “to\nrefuse to disclose, and to prevent another from disclosing, a confidential\ncommunication between client and lawyer.” A “confidential communication,”\nmoreover, is defined as “information transmitted between a client and his or her\nlawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence by a means which, so\nfar as the client is aware, discloses the information to no third persons other than\nthose who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or\nthose to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the\ninformation or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is\nconsulted, and includes a legal opinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer\nin the course of that relationship.” (Evid. Code, § 952.)\n\n       B. Application to County’s Invoices for Legal Services\n       As with all questions of statutory interpretation, our foremost task is to give\neffect to the Legislature’s purpose. (See Tuolumne Jobs & Small Business\nAlliance v. Superior Court (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1037.) In doing so, we\nanalyze the statute’s text in its relevant context, as text so read tends to be the\nclearest, most cogent indicator of a specific provision’s purpose in the larger\nstatutory scheme. We interpret relevant terms in light of their ordinary meaning,\nwhile also taking account of any related provisions and the overall structure of the\nstatutory scheme to determine what interpretation best advances the Legislature’s\nunderlying purpose.

(See Mitchell, supra, 37\nCal.3d at p. 599.) These provisions do so by prohibiting disclosure of any\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f“confidential communication between client and lawyer.” (Evid. Code, § 954.)\nThe Evidence Code also states that “ ‘confidential communication between client\nand lawyer’ means information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer\nin the course of that relationship and in confidence . . . , and includes a legal\nopinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer in the course of that\nrelationship.” (Id., § 952; see also Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 733 [“the\nprivilege attaches to any legal advice given in the course of an attorney-client\nrelationship”].) The key question, then, is this: Would treating invoices as\nsometimes nonprivileged undermine the fundamental purpose of the attorney-\nclient privilege?\n       The ACLU says no. Merely sending invoices to a client, the ACLU\ncontends, does not always “further the purpose of legal representation.” Rather,\ninvoices are meant to help a service provider secure payment for services\nrendered. The mere fact that an attorney chose to transmit his or her invoices in\nconfidence is of no moment, according to the ACLU. Such invoices further a\nseparate business purpose that is merely incidental to the attorney-client\nrelationship. We agree –– but only up to a point. The attorney-client privilege\nonly protects communications between attorney and client made for the purpose of\nseeking or delivering the attorney’s legal advice or representation. Evidence Code\nsection 952 twice states that the privilege extends only to those communications\nmade “in the course of [the attorney-client] relationship,” a construction\nsuggesting a nexus between the communication and the attorney’s professional\nrole.3 The Evidence Code also repeatedly refers to “consultation” between the\nattorney and client. (See id., § 951 [defining a “client” as someone who “consults\n\n3     The phrase “in the course of that relationship” has appeared unchanged in\nEvidence Code section 952 since its enactment in 1965.\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fa lawyer for the purpose of retaining the lawyer or securing legal service or advice\nfrom him in his professional capacity”]; id., § 952 [defining “confidential\ncommunication between client and lawyer” as “information transmitted in\nconfidence by a means which . . . discloses to no third persons other than those\nwho are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or to those to\nwhom disclosure is reasonably necessary for . . . the accomplishment of the\npurpose for which the lawyer is consulted”].)\n       These references underscore that the privilege does not apply to every\nsingle communication transmitted confidentially between lawyer and client.\nRather, the heartland of the privilege protects those communications that bear\nsome relationship to the attorney’s provision of legal consultation. (See Roberts,\nsupra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 371 [explaining that “under the Evidence Code, the attorney-\nclient privilege applies to confidential communications within the scope of the\nattorney-client relationship” (italics added)]; see also Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th at\np. 743 (conc. opn. of George, C. J.) [Evid. Code § 952 “identifies a ‘ “confidential\ncommunication” ’ in general terms as meaning ‘information transmitted between a\nclient and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship,’ but the provision\nalso supplies more specific examples of what is meant by adding that a\nconfidential communication ‘includes a legal opinion formed and the advice given\nby the lawyer in the course of that relationship’ ” (italics omitted)].)\n       Justice Werdegar’s dissenting opinion suggests that the Evidence Code’s\ndefinition of the attorney-client privilege forecloses any inquiry into whether a\ncommunication is related to legal consultation. Yet the Evidence Code’s\ndefinition of the privilege concerns not only the manner in which information is\ntransmitted, but the nature of the communication. The statute treats the term\n“confidential communication between client and lawyer” as one that requires\nfurther definition, and the definition it provides extends only to that information\n\n                                          10\n\ftransmitted “in the course of [the attorney-client] relationship.” (Evid. Code, §\n952, italics added.) The same definition also refers to “those who are present to\nfurther the interest of the client in the consultation” and “the accomplishment of\nthe purpose for which the lawyer is consulted. (Ibid., italics added.) A similar\nfocus is plain in related definitions of the Evidence Code. For example, the statute\ndefines “client” as someone who “consults a lawyer for the purpose of retaining\nthe lawyer or securing legal service or advice from him in his professional\ncapacity.” (Id., § 951.) And a “confidential communication between client and\nlawyer,” according to the statute, “includes a legal opinion formed and the advice\ngiven by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.” (Id., § 952.) These\nreferences cut against an understanding of the privilege in this context as\nencompassing every conceivable communication a client and attorney share, and\ninstead link the privilege to communications that bear some relationship to the\nprovision of legal consultation.\n       Invoices for legal services are generally not communicated for the purpose\nof legal consultation. Rather, they are communicated for the purpose of billing the\nclient and, to the extent they have no other purpose or effect, they fall outside the\nscope of an attorney’s professional representation.

Costco had retained a law firm to advise it on\nwhether certain managers were exempt from wage and overtime laws. An\nattorney at the firm interviewed two Costco managers and then sent the company a\nconfidential 22-page opinion letter. Several years later, some Costco employees\nfiled a lawsuit claiming that Costco had misclassified and underpaid its managers.\nAs part of that litigation, the plaintiffs tried to compel discovery of the attorney’s\nopinion letter. Over Costco’s objection, the trial court ordered disclosure of the\nletter, allowing portions of it containing the attorney’s impressions, observations,\nand opinions to be redacted. (Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 730-731.) The\nconfidential opinion letter at issue in Costco was indisputably privileged, and the\nplaintiffs never claimed otherwise. (See id. at pp. 735-736 [the plaintiffs “never\ndisputed” that Costco retained the law firm to provide Costco with “legal advice,”\nwhich was provided in the form of the opinion letter].)\n       In ruling that Costco did not need to turn over this opinion letter, we took\ncare to explain that the same rule would not apply to all communications between\na lawyer and his or her client. The privilege, for example, “is not applicable when\nthe attorney acts merely as a negotiator for the client or is providing business\nadvice [citation]; in that case, the relationship between the parties to the\ncommunication is not one of attorney-client.” (Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th at\np. 735.) The same is true when a lawyer is billing his or her client: the\nrelationship evokes an arm’s-length transaction between parties in the market for\nprofessional services more than it does the diligent but discreet conveyance of\nfacts and advice that epitomizes the bond between lawyer and client. An\n\n                                          12\n\forganization may strongly oppose, and sternly resist, public disclosure of its legal\nbills, just as a business adviser or public relations consultant might do the same.\nBut the extent of this resistance does not dictate the scope of the attorney-client\nprivilege.\n       What Costco also reaffirmed is the longstanding principle that “a client\ncannot protect unprivileged information from discovery by transmitting it to an\nattorney,” though we noted that this “concern [was] not present here.” (Costco,\nsupra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 735; see also Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Court (1961) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1156268\"><a href=\"/opinion/1156268/greyhound-corp-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 397 [“ ‘Knowledge which is not otherwise privileged does not become\nso merely by being communicated to an attorney.’ ”].) Costco thus recognized\nthat not all communications between attorney and client become privileged solely\nby virtue of the mode of communication (confidential versus not). And though\nCostco made this point with regard to information sent from client to attorney, we\nsee no reason why the reverse situation would require a different rule. After all, a\nlawyer may well send a government client an e-mail that has nothing to do with\nlegal advice. For example, a lawyer might e-mail details about a firm’s efforts to\nmove to a newly constructed office building or host a political fundraiser. Even if\nthese communications are confidential (as would be true for any e-mail\ncommunication), they are not made for the purpose of legal consultation and are\ntherefore not protected by the attorney-client privilege.\n       The same is true for billing invoices. While a client’s fees have some\nancillary relationship to legal consultation, an invoice listing amounts of fees is\nnot communicated for the purpose of legal consultation. The mere fact that an\nattorney transmitted a communication to his or her client confidentially (in the\nsense that no one other than the recipient could see the communication) does not\nend the inquiry into whether the communication’s contents are protected by the\nattorney-client privilege. After all, just about every communication between a\n\n                                          13\n\flawyer and client is intended to be kept private, regardless of whether the\ncommunication has any connection to legal consultation at all. Even the fact that\nthe information communicated may have some ancillary bearing on an attorney’s\nrelationship to a client (as information about an office move or political fundraiser\nmight have) does not end our inquiry into whether the attorney-client privilege\napplies. Nor does the fact that an attorney would prefer to keep the information\nconfidential (as most people would prefer for their emails).\n       What the inquiry turns on instead is the link between the content of the\ncommunication and the types of communication that the attorney-client privilege\nwas designed to keep confidential. In order for a communication to be privileged,\nit must be made for the purpose of the legal consultation, rather than some\nunrelated or ancillary purpose. As Chief Justice George put it in his concurring\nopinion in Costco: “the communication also must occur ‘in the course of’ the\nattorney-client relationship (Evid. Code, § 952) — that is, the communication\nmust have been made for the purpose of the legal representation.” (Costco, supra,\n47 Cal.4th at p. 742 (conc. opn. of George, C. J.).) Considering Evidence Code\nsection 952 “as a whole,” continued Chief Justice George, it becomes “even\nclearer that the Legislature intended to extend the protection of the privilege solely\nto those communications between the lawyer and the client that are made for the\npurpose of seeking or delivering the lawyer’s legal advice or representation.”\n(Costco, 47 Cal.4th at p. 743 (conc. opn. of George, C. J.).) While Chief Justice\nGeorge’s views are expressed in a concurring opinion, the opinion emphasizes a\ncrucial distinction that is relevant here, between the opinion letter at issue in that\ncase and the invoices at issue here. Unlike an opinion letter, a billing invoice is\nnot “made for the purpose of the legal representation.” (Id. at p. 742.)\n       But while billing invoices are generally not “made for the purpose of legal\nrepresentation,” the information contained within certain invoices may be within\n\n                                           14\n\fthe scope of the privilege. To the extent that billing information is conveyed “for\nthe purpose of legal representation” –– perhaps to inform the client of the nature or\namount of work occurring in connection with a pending legal issue –– such\ninformation lies in the heartland of the attorney-client privilege. And even if the\ninformation is more general, such as aggregate figures describing the total amount\nspent on continuing litigation during a given quarter or year, it may come close\nenough to this heartland to threaten the confidentiality of information directly\nrelevant to the attorney’s distinctive professional role. The attorney-client\nprivilege protects the confidentiality of information in both those categories, even\nif the information happens to be transmitted in a document that is not itself\ncategorically privileged. When a legal matter remains pending and active, the\nprivilege encompasses everything in an invoice, including the amount of aggregate\nfees. This is because, even though the amount of money paid for legal services is\ngenerally not privileged, an invoice that shows a sudden uptick in spending “might\nvery well reveal much of [a government agency]’s investigative efforts and trial\nstrategy.” (Mitchell, supra, 37 Cal.3d at p. 610.) Midlitigation swings in\nspending, for example, could reveal an impending filing or outsized concern about\na recent event.\n       The same may not be true for fee totals in legal matters that concluded long\nago. In contrast to information involving a pending case, a cumulative fee total for\na long-completed matter does not always reveal the substance of legal\nconsultation. The fact that the amounts in both cases were communicated in an\ninvoice transmitted confidentially from lawyer to client does not automatically\nmake this information privileged. Instead, the privilege turns on whether those\namounts reveal anything about legal consultation. Asking an agency to disclose\nthe cumulative amount it spent on long-concluded litigation –– with no ongoing\nlitigation to shed light on the context from which such records are arising –– may\n\n                                         15\n\fcommunicate little or nothing about the substance of legal consultation. But when\nthose same cumulative totals are communicated during ongoing litigation, this\nreal-time disclosure of ongoing spending amounts can indirectly reveal clues about\nlegal strategy, especially when multiple amounts over time are compared.\n       Justice Werdegar is concerned that our opinion suggests the “scope of the\nprivilege somehow wanes with the termination of the subject litigation.” But the\nquestion at issue here is not, as Justice Werdegar suggests, whether privileged\nmaterial remains privileged when “the attorney-client relationship has ended.”\n(Dis. opn., post, at p. 7.) Even while the scope of the attorney-client privilege\nremains constant over time, the same information (for example, the cumulative\namount of money that was spent on a case) takes on a different significance if it is\nrevealed during the course of active litigation. During active litigation, that\ninformation can threaten the confidentiality of legal consultation by revealing legal\nstrategy. But there may come a point when this very same information no longer\ncommunicates anything privileged, because it no longer provides any insight into\nlitigation strategy or legal consultation.\n       Our conclusion that the privilege turns on content and purpose, not form,\nfits not only with the terms of the statute but also the law as it existed before the\nEvidence Code was enacted. The Evidence Code was meant to incorporate prior\nlaw on the attorney-client privilege. (See Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B\npt. 3A West’s Ann. Evid. Code (2009 ed.) foll. § 952, p. 307 [“The requirement\nthat the communication be made in the course of the lawyer-client relationship and\nbe confidential is in accord with existing law.”].) Before 1965, the long-\nestablished rule in California was that the attorney-client privilege — then set\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\fforth in the Code of Civil Procedure4 — protected communications made for the\npurpose of the attorney’s professional representation. (See, e.g., Solon v.\nLichtenstein (1952) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1114506\"><a href=\"/opinion/1114506/solon-v-lichtenstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 [“A communication to be privileged must\nhave been made to an attorney acting in his professional capacity toward his\nclient.”].)\n       Further support for this conclusion comes from the language and structure\nof a related statutory scheme. Business and Professions Code section 6148,\nsubdivision (a), describes the information that a contract for legal services (i.e., a\nfee agreement) must generally contain. Subdivision (b), on the other hand,\ndescribes the information that attorney billing statements (such as invoices) must\ngenerally contain. (See id., § 6148, subd. (b).) But Business and Professions\nCode section 6149 states that only fee agreements “shall be deemed to be a\nconfidential communication within the meaning of . . . Section 952 of the\nEvidence Code.” This section makes no mention of billing statements or invoices.\nThe Legislature’s decision to define both fee agreements and billing statements in\none section, while in the very next section subjecting only the former to the\nattorney-client privilege, suggests that the privilege was not intended to protect\nboth fee agreements and invoices in the exact same way. (See Pasadena Police\nOfficers Assn. v. City of Pasadena (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192081\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192081/pasadena-police-officers-assn-v-city-of-pasadena/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576 [“When the\n\n\n\n\n4      “An attorney cannot, without the consent of his client, be examined as to\nany communication made by the client to him, or his advice given thereon in the\ncourse of professional employment.” (Code Civ.

(See,\ne.g., Concepcion v. Amscan Holdings, Inc. (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Indeed, disclosure\nof billing invoices is the norm in the federal courts in California, where “[f]ee\ninformation is generally not privileged.” (Federal Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp. v. Ferm\n(9th Cir. 1990) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374; see also Tornay v.

Our holding today is consistent with that\napproach — an approach with which the County, a frequent litigant in federal\ncourt, is undoubtedly familiar.\n       None of the County’s remaining arguments supports the conclusion that all\ninformation in attorney invoices is categorically privileged. In particular, the\nCounty observes that disclosure of invoices can provide adversaries a window into\nlitigation strategies — “a road map as to how the matter is being litigated, or may\nbe litigated in the future.” We are sensitive to the County’s concern here, but this\nconcern does not require the rule that Court of Appeal established and that the\n\n\n5       The reason for this discrepancy, according to the County, is that invoices\n“so obviously met [Evidence Code section 952’s] definition of communications”\nthat the Legislature saw no need to specify that they were privileged. We are not\nconvinced. As explained above, we do not think Evidence Code section 952\ncategorically protects invoices. And, in any event, whether it does is far from\n“obvious[].”\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fCounty insists on, which is a categorical bar on disclosure of a government\nagency’s expenditures for any legal matter, past or present, active or inactive, open\nor closed. Though the PRA carves out an exemption for privileged portions of\ngovernment records, “[t]he fact that parts of a requested document fall within the\nterms of an exemption does not justify withholding the entire document.” (CBS,\nInc. v. Block, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 653.) Instead, government agencies must\ndisclose “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion” of a public record “after deletion of\nthe portions that are exempted by law.” (§ 6253, subd. (a).)\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f                                 III. CONCLUSION\n       The imperative of protecting privileged communications between attorney\nand client –– and thereby promoting full and frank discussion between them –– is\na defining feature of our law. This imperative does not require us to conclude —\nas the Court of Appeal did here — that everything in a public agency’s invoices\nfor legal services is categorically privileged. Instead, the contents of an invoice\nare privileged only if they either communicate information for the purpose of legal\nconsultation or risk exposing information that was communicated for such a\npurpose. This latter category includes any invoice that reflects work in active and\nongoing litigation. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal\nand remand for proceedings consistent with our opinion.\n                                                  CUÉLLAR, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCHIN, J.\nLIU, J.\nKRUGER, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f                 DISSENTING OPINION BY WERDEGAR, J.\n\n       The importance of the attorney-client evidentiary privilege to the proper\nfunctioning of the legal system in this state cannot be overstated. “The attorney-\nclient privilege has been a hallmark of Anglo-American jurisprudence for almost\n400 years. [Citations.] The privilege authorizes a client to refuse to disclose, and\nto prevent others from disclosing, confidential communications between attorney\nand client. (Evid. Code, § 950 et seq.) Clearly, the fundamental purpose behind\nthe privilege is to safeguard the confidential relationship between clients and their\nattorneys so as to promote full and open discussion of the facts and tactics\nsurrounding individual legal matters. [Citation.] In other words, the public policy\nfostered by the privilege seeks to insure ‘the right of every person to freely and\nfully confer and confide in one having knowledge of the law, and skilled in its\npractice, in order that the former may have adequate advice and a proper\ndefense.’ ” (Mitchell v. Superior Court (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1408972\"><a href=\"/opinion/1408972/mitchell-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 599, fn. omitted.)\n“Although exercise of the privilege may occasionally result in the suppression of\nrelevant evidence, the Legislature of this state has determined that these concerns\nare outweighed by the importance of preserving confidentiality in the attorney-\nclient relationship.” (Ibid.)\n       With today’s decision, a majority of the court undermines this pillar of our\njurisprudence, finding legal invoices sent from a law firm to its client, although\n\finitially protected by the attorney-client privilege, may lose such protection once\nthe subject litigation is concluded. This conclusion finds no support in the plain\nmeaning of the words of the attorney-client privilege as set forth in Evidence Code\nsection 954,1 and are in fact contrary to a recent decision by this court interpreting\nthe scope of the privilege. I respectfully dissent.\n                                           I.\n       The attorney-client privilege is set forth in section 954 and provides in\npertinent part that a “client, whether or not a party, has a privilege to refuse to\ndisclose, and to prevent another from disclosing, a confidential communication\nbetween client and lawyer . . . .” The phrase “ ‘confidential communication\nbetween client and lawyer’ ” is, as relevant here, defined in section 952 as\n“information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of\nthat relationship and in confidence . . . and includes a legal opinion formed and the\nadvice given by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.” No question exists\nthat the invoices at issue in this case comprise “information transmitted” between\na law firm and its client, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors,2 that the\n\n\n1      All statutory references are to the Evidence Code unless otherwise stated.\n2       Although we may presume for purposes of argument the fee invoices\nconsidered here do not include a “legal opinion formed” or “advice given” within\nthe course of that relationship, section 952’s use of the term “includes” means that\nthe scope of the privilege is not limited to legal opinions and advice. “ ‘[I]ncludes’\n[is] ordinarily a term of enlargement rather than limitation.” (Ornelas v.

The majority\ndoes not dispute that the attorney-client privilege covers more than just legal\nopinions and advice, but nevertheless asserts language in various sub-clauses of\nsection 952 mean the attorney-client privilege covers only “communications that\nbear some relationship to the provision of legal consultation.” (Maj. opn., ante,\n                                                            (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                           2\n\finformation was generated within the course of the attorney-client relationship,\nand that the invoices were prepared and transmitted in confidence. As such, the\ninvoices are privileged, and thus not subject to disclosure under the Public\nRecords Act. (Gov. Code, § 6254, subd. (k).)3\n        The majority reaches a different conclusion by embellishing the words of\nthe statutory privilege to discover a heretofore hidden meaning. According to the\nmajority, the “key question” is: “Would treating invoices as sometimes\nnonprivileged undermine the fundamental purpose of the attorney-client\nprivilege?” (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 9, italics added.) The opinion then reasons the\nprivilege protects only those “communications between attorney and client made\nfor the purpose of seeking or delivering the attorney’s legal advice or\nrepresentation.” (Ibid., italics added.) Therefore, concludes the majority, “the\nprivilege does not apply to every single communication transmitted confidentially\nbetween lawyer and client. Rather, the heartland of the privilege protects those\ncommunications that bear some relationship to the attorney’s provision of legal\nconsultation.” (Id. at p. 10, italics added.)\n\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\np. 10.) As I explain, post, this interpretation of sections 954 and 952 is far too\nnarrow and contrary to existing authority.\n3      Government Code section 6254, subdivision (k) states that the Public\nRecords Act does not require disclosure of the following records: “Records, the\ndisclosure of which is exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law,\nincluding, but not limited to, provisions of the Evidence Code relating to\nprivilege.” (Italics added.) “By its reference to the privileges contained in the\nEvidence Code, therefore, the Public Records Act has made the attorney-client\nprivilege applicable to public records.” (Roberts v. City of Palmdale (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1245018\"><a href=\"/opinion/1245018/roberts-v-city-of-palmdale/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f       The majority’s decision to add consideration of a communication’s purpose\nas an additional, nonstatutory element to the Legislature’s definition of a\n“confidential communication” is unsupported in law. Absent those rare situations\nin which the attorney-client privilege facilitates a person’s constitutional rights\nunder the Sixth Amendment,4 the evidentiary privilege at issue in this case is\nstatutory only. As we have recognized, “[o]ur deference to the Legislature is\nparticularly necessary when we are called upon to interpret the attorney-client\nprivilege, because the Legislature has determined that evidentiary privileges shall\nbe available only as defined by statute. (Evid. Code, § 911.) Courts may not add\nto the statutory privileges except as required by state or federal constitutional law\n[citations], nor may courts imply unwritten exceptions to existing statutory\nprivileges.” (Roberts v. City of Palmdale, supra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 373, italics\nadded.) As the California Law Revision Commission has commented, “privileges\nare not recognized in the absence of statute,” and “[t]his is one of the few\ninstances where the Evidence Code precludes the courts from elaborating upon the\nstatutory scheme.” (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B pt. 3A West’s Ann. Evid.\nCode, foll. § 911, at p. 219.)\n       This court recently spoke to the scope of the attorney-client privilege in\nCostco Wholesale Corp. v.

In\nCostco, the issue, as in the instant case, concerned a communication between a\nlawyer and client that arguably contained both confidential information (in the\nform of legal opinions) and nonconfidential information (such as facts obtained\n\n\n4      See, e.g., Barber v.

The Costco plaintiffs contended they were entitled to discovery\nof the nonprivileged portions of a letter legal counsel sent to the defendant.\nInterpreting sections 952 and 954, this court unanimously rejected the claim,\nexplaining that “[t]he attorney-client privilege attaches to a confidential\ncommunication between the attorney and the client and bars discovery of the\ncommunication irrespective of whether it includes unprivileged material. As we\nexplained in Mitchell v. Superior Court, supra, 37 Cal.3d at page 600: ‘[T]he\nprivilege covers the transmission of documents which are available to the public,\nand not merely information in the sole possession of the attorney or client. In this\nregard, it is the actual fact of the transmission which merits protection, since\ndiscovery of the transmission of specific public documents might very well reveal\nthe transmitter’s intended strategy.’ ” (Costco, supra, at p. 734, italics added.)\nFurther, “ ‘[n]either the statutes articulating the attorney-client privilege nor the\ncases which have interpreted it make any differentiation between “factual” and\n“legal” information.’ ” (Ibid.)\n       The majority seemingly embraces the notion that courts may parse a legal\ncommunication to permit disclosure of those parts that were not “made for the\npurpose of legal consultation” (maj. opn., ante, at p. 13), but strains to distinguish\nCostco, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, unconvincingly suggesting that when an attorney\nbills a client for legal services rendered, he or she steps outside the role of a\nlawyer and into the role of accountant. (Maj. opn., ante, p. 12 [“the relationship\nevokes an arm’s-length transaction between parties in the market for professional\nservices more than it does the diligent but discreet conveyance of facts and advice\nthat epitomizes the bond between lawyer and client”].) Accordingly, reasons the\nmajority, legal billing invoices may fall outside the protection of the attorney-\nclient privilege because they “are not made for the purpose of legal consultation.”\n(Id., at p. 13.) But this is not a situation in which an attorney is acting as\n\n                                           5\n\fsomething other than a legal representative, such as a real estate agent or business\nadvisor; the invoice in question was for legal services rendered.\n       More to the point, the majority’s line of analysis ignores the core reasoning\nof Costco that section 954 prohibits courts from parsing a communication between\nlawyer and client in order that those parts not involving a legal opinion or advice\ncan be disclosed. As Costco explained, despite what might be the dominant\npurpose of a communication, “when the communication is a confidential one\nbetween attorney and client, the entire communication, including its recitation or\nsummary of factual material, is privileged.” (Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 736,\nitalics added.) Costco’s analysis, applied here, leads inexorably to the conclusion\nthat the legal invoices at issue are privileged under sections 952 and 954.5\n       Even more pernicious than the majority’s improper addition of a\nnonstatutory prerequisite to the attorney-client privilege, and its unconvincing\nattempt to distinguish Costco, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, is its suggestion that the\nprotective scope of the privilege somehow wanes with the termination of the\nsubject litigation. Thus, the majority opines that “[w]hen a legal matter remains\npending and active, the privilege encompasses everything in an invoice—\n\n\n5       To the extent the majority relies on former Chief Justice George’s\nconcurring opinion in Costco (maj. opn, ante, at pp. 13–14), it mischaracterizes his\nviews. (Costco, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 741–744 conc. opn. of George, C. J.). In\na separate opinion, former Chief Justice George distinguished the situation in\nwhich information is transmitted between the client and the lawyer in the course of\nthe attorney-client relationship, which information is privileged, from the situation\nin which information is communicated to an attorney outside the context of an\nattorney-client relationship, which information is unprivileged. “[A]\ncommunication in the context of section 952 need not concern litigation; rather it\nsuffices that the communication consist of information transmitted between the\nclient and the lawyer within the scope of the attorney-client relationship.” (Id. at\np. 743 (conc. opn. of George, C. J.).)\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fincluding the amount of aggregate fees.” (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 15.) But the\nmajority then suggests a more limited rule of privilege may apply once the\nlitigation ends, saying that “[t]he same may not be true for fee totals in legal\nmatters that concluded long ago.” (Ibid.) That the majority fails to cite any\nlanguage in sections 952 or 954 supporting such a rule is unsurprising, for nothing\nin the Evidence Code supports the notion that the reach of the attorney-client\nprivilege is different for pending litigation versus legal matters that have\nconcluded.\n       Indeed, legal authority is to the contrary. In Littlefield v. Superior Court\n(1982) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2153471\"><a href=\"/opinion/2153471/littlefield-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, a defendant in a criminal case sought a writ of\nmandate to force his codefendant to testify and reveal confidential conversations\nhe had with his lawyer, the Los Angeles County Public Defender. (It was the\ndefendant’s contention the public defender had disclosed facts about the alleged\nmurders to the codefendant, which allowed him to fabricate testimony detrimental\nto the defendant.) Although the defendant acknowledged the communications\nwere presumptively protected by the attorney-client privilege, he argued “that\nprivilege may be deemed attenuated because the attorney/client relationship is\n‘near an end.’ ” (Id. at p. 481.) The appellate court properly disagreed, explaining\nthat “the attorney/client privilege continues even after the end of threat of\npunishment” (id. at p. 482), and that “[n]othing in the statutes controlling the\nprivilege suggests it is to be limited or diminished in importance as a function of\nthe continuance of the relationship that existed at the time of the confidential\ncommunications herein sought” (ibid.). In other words, the protective power of\nthe attorney-client privilege is not reduced simply because the attorney-client\nrelationship has ended or is about to end. (Cf. HLC Properties, Ltd. v. Superior\nCourt (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2581569\"><a href=\"/opinion/2581569/hlc-properties-ltd-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 [attorney-client privilege continues to protect\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fcovered communications until no person or entity exists who is statutorily\nauthorized to assert it].)\n       Secondary sources are even more pointed. The attorney-client privilege\n“attaches upon the initial consultation . . . and continues beyond the end of the\nattorney-client relationship for so long as a ‘holder’ is in existence.” (Vapnek et\nal., Cal. Practice Guide: Professional Responsibility (The Rutter Group 2003)\n¶ 7:265, p. 7–114 (Aug. 2016 Update).) “The right to claim the attorney-client\nprivilege is not limited to the litigation or controversy in the course of which a\nprotected communication was made. It survives the termination of litigation and\ncontinues even after the threat of liability or punishment has passed.” (Id.,\n¶ 7:269, p. 7–115, italics added.)\n       The majority’s suggestion the protective power of the attorney-client\nprivilege under section 954 “may not” (maj. opn., ante, at p. 15) continue to\nencompass all portions of a document that previously qualified as a “confidential\ncommunication” under section 952 is mischievous in the extreme. Following\ntoday’s decision, attorneys in this state must counsel their clients that confidential\ncommunications between lawyer and client, previously protected by the attorney-\nclient privilege, may be forced into the open by interested parties once the subject\nlitigation has concluded. If a limiting principle applies to this new rule, it is not\nperceptible to me.6\n\n6       The majority confusingly asserts “the scope of the attorney-client privilege\nremains constant over time,” but that, after an undetermined period of time,\nprivileged “information . . . takes on a different significance” (maj. opn., ante,\np. 16, italics added), such that it can lose its confidential status. But if the scope of\nthe privilege is constant over time, how information—once privileged—\nnevertheless loses its protected status is unexplained by the majority. If the\nmajority is saying that a court may refuse to recognize the privileged status of\nonce-privileged information if it determines the information is no longer of\n                                                             (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                           8\n\f        Nor is it any saving grace that “disclosure of billing invoices is the norm in\nthe federal courts in California, where ‘[f]ee information is generally not\nprivileged.’ ” (Maj. opn, ante, at p. 18.) Although by this argument the majority\nsuggests that a strong weight of legal opinion backing its views exists in the\nfederal universe, such support is ephemeral. The cases cited by the majority rely\non Federal Rule of Evidence 501, which simply incorporates federal common\nlaw.7 By contrast, the scope of the attorney-client privilege in California state\ncourts is governed by the detailed and specific definition of a “confidential\ncommunication” as set forth in section 952. The majority’s comparison of apples\nto oranges is thus unpersuasive.\n                                          II.\n        As noted above, the conclusion reached by the majority today is\ninconsistent with our interpretation of section 952 in Costco, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">725</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. But even setting Costco aside, this court is simply not free to add elements\nand prerequisites to a statutory rule of evidentiary privilege. Whether it might be\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nstrategic value to a litigant, I disagree, and further observe the majority cites no\nauthority for this remarkable position.\n\n7       Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (28 U.S.C.) states in pertinent\npart: “The common law—as interpreted by United States courts in the light of\nreason and experience—governs a claim of privilege unless any of the following\nprovides otherwise:\n  • the United States Constitution;\n  • a federal statute; or\n  • rules prescribed by the Supreme Court.”\n        But the same rule goes on to suggest the primacy of state law rules of\nprivilege, providing that, “in a civil case, state law governs privilege regarding a\nclaim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision.” (Ibid., italics\nadded.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fwise policy to find a “confidential communication” within the meaning of section\n952 must be one “made for the purpose of seeking or delivering the attorney’s\nlegal advice or representation” (maj. opn., ante, at p. 9), is a question more\nproperly consigned to the discretion of the Legislature and not this court.\n       I dissent.\n                                                  WERDEGAR, J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.
