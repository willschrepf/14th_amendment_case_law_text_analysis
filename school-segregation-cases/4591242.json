Railroad Comission of Texas, 240\nS.W.2d 747 (Tex. 1951). The clear language of the statute requires\nthat money in the interest and sinking fund be expended only for three\nspecified purposes. The district is without authori~tyto expend the\nfunds for any other purpose. But see Water Code 151.437 (permitting\nthe investment of the funds in certain instances). Moreover,    absent\nspecific statutory authority to the contrary, monies in an interest\nand sinking fund may be used for no other purpose than the one for\nwhich it was created. Bexar County Hospital District v. Crosby, 327\nS.W.2d 445 (Tex. 1959). _See Attorney General Opinion H-658 (1975).\n\n     This rule applies when bonds remain outstanding. The rule is\nless clear when all of the outstanding bonds have been retired and\nthere remains a surplus in the interest and sinking fund. In specific\ninstances, the Texas Legislature has permitted the expenditure of\nsurplus interest and sinking fund monies after the bonds outstanding\nare retired. See, e.g.. V.T.C.S. arts. 723, 752a. The Water Code,\nhowever, is silent 8s to whether surplus monies in the interest and\nsinking fund can be expended after the bonds outstanding are retired.\n\n     It has been suggested that any surplus monies in the interest and\nsinking fund can be expended for any lawful purpose of the taxing\n\n\n\n\n                                     p. 608\n\fHonorable Luther Jones - Page 3      (JM-142)\n\n\n\n\nunit.  Cited in support of such a proposition is Madeley v. Trustees\nof Conroe Independent School District, 130 S.W.2d 929 (Tex. Civ. App.\n- Beaumont 1939, writ dism’d judgmt co=.). We disagree both with the\nproposition and with the characterization of the Madeley case.\nMadeley concerned the disposition of surplus monies in the maintenance\nfund of an independent school district which the trustees sought to\nexpend on the erection and equipment of a school building. The court\nheld that the surplus monies in the maintenance fund ceased to be\ngoverned by the strictures imposed thereon by statutes specifying the\npurposes for which maintenance funds could be expended once the\npurpose of the statutes has been effectuated.\n\n         If and when the statutes cease to control the\n         fund, then it becomes a constitutional fund and\n         not a statutory fund, and may be used by the\n         trustees for the constitutional purposes; one of\n         the constitutional purposes is ‘the erection and\n         equipment of     school buildings’ within      the\n         district.    what we have said is in full\n         recognition of the legal proposition that the fund\n         collected for the support and maintenance of the\n         public free schools, to the extent that it is\n         needed for thnt purpose, can not be diverted to\n         any other purpose.\n\nMadeley v. Conroe Independent School District, supra at 934.\n\n     The following language in Madeley is that cited in support of the\nproposition that surplus monies in the interest and sinking fund may\nbe expended for any lawful purpose of the taxing unit.\n\n            The following illustration is in point on our\n         holding: Where a district has issued bonds and\n         voted a tax to retire them, what becomes of the\n         surplus of the tax when the bonds are retired?\n         Since it is not reasonable that the exact amount\n         of the bonds will be collected, on every bond\n         issue the trustees will have in their hands a\n         surplus. Again, a tax payer permits his tax to\n         become delinquent until after the bonds are\n         retired; when sued, can he defend on the ground\n         that the bonds for which the tax against his\n         property was levied have been paid off? When the\n         delinquent tax is collected, how shall it be\n         expended? These questions find their answer in\n         Sec. 3 of Art. 7 of the Constitution; where the\n         bonds hnve been paid off the statutes regulating\n         the expenditure of the funds for their payment\n         cease to control the power of the trustees in the\n         expenditure of the surplus, and its expenditure\n\n\n\n\n                                  p. 609\n\fHonorable Luther Jones - Page 4    (m-142)\n\n\n\n\n          rests in the discretion of the trustees, under\n          Sec. 3 of Art. 7 of the Constitution.\n\nId. For two reasons we conclude that such language is not dispositive\nof the issue before us. First, the paragraph is dicta. At issue in\nMadeley was a surplus in the maintenance fund, not in the interest and\nsinking fund.\n\n     Second, and more importantly, the court specifically held that\narticle VII, section 3 of the Texas Constitution permitted school\ndistricts to levy a maintenance tax for “the erection and equipment of\nschool buildings” within the district, as well as “for the further\nmaintenance of public free schools.” Tex. Const. art. VII, $3. The\ncourt noted that. for years, trustees of independent school  districts\nhad expended surplus monies in maintenance funds for erection of\npublic school buildings. The constitutional provisions under which\nwater control and improvement districts are created do not contain\nlanguage similar to that of article VII, section 3. See Water Code\n551.011. Article III, section 52 of the Texas Constitution authorizes\nthe legislature to permit political subdivisions to issue bonds for\ncertain specified purposes and to “levy and collect taxes to pay the\ninterest thereon and provide a sinking fund for the redemption\nthereof . . . .” Clearly, article III, section 52 contemplates the\ncreation of a discrete, segregated interest and sinking fund; there is\nno language which could be construed to permit the expenditure of any\nsurplus interest and sinking fund monies for any purpose other than\nthe payment of interest and the redemption of outstanding bonds.\n\n     Likewise, article XVI, section 59 of the Texas Constitution\nauthorizes the legislature to permit conservation and reclamation\ndistricts to issue bonds “as may be necessary to provide all\nimprovements and the maintenance thereof requisite to the achievement\nof the purposes of this amendment” and to levy and collect “all such\ntaxes, equitably distributed, as may be necessary for the payment   of\nthe interest and the creation of a sinking fund for the payment of\nsuch bonds; and also for the maintenance of such districts and\nimprovements . . . .‘I Again, it is clear that the constitution\ncontemplates the creation of at least two discrete funds, one for\nmaintenance of the districts and one for the payment of interest on\nand redemption of outstanding bonds. And again, there is no language\nin article III, section 52 which could be construed to pensit the\nexpenditure of surplus interest and sinking fund monies for any lawful\npurpose of the taxing unit.\n\n     There is admittedly a dearth of explicit, direct authority in\nthis area. Courts in other jurisdictions have held that surplus\nmonies in an interest and sinking fund can be expended after out-\nstanding bonds have been redeemed for purposes other than those for\nwhich the bonds were originally issued and sold, but only when such\nwas specifically provided by statute. See, e.g., Diver v. Village of\n\n\n\n\n                                  p. 610\n\fHonorable Luther Jones - Page 5    (JM-142)\n\n\n\n\nGlencoe, 379 N.E.2d 1214 (Ill. App. 1978); Jack's Cookie Corp. v.\nGiles County, 407 S.W.Zd 446 (Term. 1966); St. Louis-San Francisco Ry.\nCo. v. Ottawa County Excise Board, 207 P.7.d275 (Okla. 1949); King v.\nDuval County, 174 So. 817 (Fla. 1937); Flint v. Duval County, 170 So.\n587 (Fla. 1936); Rothschild v. Village of Calumet Park, 183 N.E. 337\n(Ill. 1932).\n\n     The dearth of authority in this area may be easily explained by\nthe fact that constitutional and statutory provisions which govern the\ncreation of sinking funds ordinarily contemplate that no more taxes\nshall be collected than are necessary to meet the principal and\ninterest on the bonds. See, e.g., East St. Louis v. Uniied States, ex\nrel. Zebley. 110 U.S. 321 (1884); E.T. Lewis Co. v. Winchester. 130\nS.W. 1094 (Ky. App. 1910); Rogge v. Petroleuq County, 80 P.2d 380\n(Mont. 1938); State v. Board of Public Instrut ction for Dade County,\n170 so. 602 (Fla. 1936); 15 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations,\n943.133 (1970). In fact, somte courts have held that anv levv creatine\nsuch a surplus is void as to the excess. People ex ;el. -Brenza v:\nFleetwood, 109 N.E.2d 741 (Ill. 1952); People ex rel. Manifold v.\nWabash RY. Co.. 53 N.E.2d 976 (Ill. 1944); Rogge v. Petroleum County,\nsupra.\n\n     We construe the Water Code to permit only the imposition of an\ninterest and sinking fund levy sufficient to pay the bonds and\ninterest as they become due. It clearly does not permit nor does it\ncontemplate the creation of a surplus. Section 51.433 provides the\nfollowing in pertinent part:\n\n          551.433. Tax Levy\n\n             (a) At the time bonds are voted, the board\n          shall levy a tax on all property inside the\n          district in a sufficient amount to redeem and\n          discharge the bonds at maturity.\n\n             (b) The board annually shall levy or have\n          assessed and collected taxes on all property\n          inside the district in a sufficient amount to pay\n          for the expenses of assessing and collecting the\n          taxes.\n\n            Cc) If a contract is made with the United\n         States, the board annually shall levy taxes on\n         property inside the district in a sufficient\n         amount to pay installments and interest as they\n         become due.\n\n             (d) The board may issue the bonds in serial\n          form or payable in installments, and the tax levy\n          shall be sufficient if it provides an amount\n\n\n\n                                  p. 611\n\fIIonorableLuther Jones - Page 6   (JM-142)\n\n\n\n\n         sufficient to pay the interest on the bonds, the\n         proportionate amount of the principal of the next\n         maturing bonds, and the expenses of assessing and\n         collecting the taxes for that year.     (Emphasis\n         added).\n\n     Section 51.434 of the code provides the following:\n\n          551.434. Adjustment of Tax Levy\n\n             (a) The tax levy wade in connection with the\n          issuance of bonds shall remain in force from year\n          to year until a new levy is made.\n\n             (b) The board may from time to time increase\n          or diminish the tax to adjust it for the taxable\n          values of the property subject to taxation by the\n          district and the amount required to be collected.\n\n             (c) The board shall raise an amount sufficient\n          to pay the annual interest of and principal on all\n          outstanding bonds. (Emphasis added).\n\n     It is suggested that Attorney General Opinion MW-97 (1979)\ncontrols this issue. In Attorney General Opinion MW-97 (1979). this\noffice declared that, in an instance in which the applicable statutes\nwere silent as to the disposition of any surplus interest and sinking\nfund monies after the redemption of bonds outstanding, such funds may\nbe expended only for the same \"public improvements\" for which the\nbonds   were   originally issued.     Quoting McQuillin, Municipal\nCorporations at Volume 15, 543.134, the opinion declared:\n\n          A sinking fund should be applied to the payment of\n          the principal and interest on the bonds which it\n          was created to service, and even though the bonds\n          have been declared void, cannot be diverted to\n          other purposes. Thus, it is an unlawful diversion\n          to transfer a sinking fund to the general\n          fund. . . . It has been held that an unallocated\n          surplus remaining after the payment of principal\n          and interest of outstanding bonds may be used for\n          the construction of a public improvement . . . .\n          (Emphasis added).\n\nThe case cited by McQuillin in support of the above underscored\nlanguage is King v. Duval County, B.        As we have already noted,\nthe rule in King is not a general rule of law with respect to the\ndisposition of surplus interest and sinking fund levies; the transfer\npermitted in King was specifically authorized by statute.

Accordingly, to the extent to\nwhich Attorney General Opinion MW-97 conflicts with this opinion, it\nis hereby overruled.\n\n     In the absence of specific statutory authority, the prevalent\njudicial and legislative reasoning appears to be that such surplus\nmonies may be refunded to taxpayers, see, e.g., Diver v.

McCuing,   234I,\".sW;.;\n                                                            eyett(Ark.\n1950). unless such refund would be impracticable.                , the\nsurplus levy may be transferred to the general maintenance fund. See\nMorton v. Baker, 494 S.W.2d 122 (Ark. 1973); Lawrence v. Jones.73\nS.W.2d 228 (Ark. 1958).\n\n     We conclude that, in the absence of statutory authority directing\nthe disposition of any surplus monies levied for the interest and\nsinking fund, the water district may refund such excess to taxpayers\nor. in the event that such refund is impracticable, transfer such\nmonies to the maintenance fund of .the district. We note that section\n51.352 of the Water Code specifies the purposes for which monies in\nmaintenance fund may be expended.       See also Water Code 951.351\n(provides that proceeds from the sale of bonds shall be deposited in\nthe construction fund and that, after the payment of obligations for\nwhich the bonds were issued, any remaining money in the construction\nfund may be transferred to the maintenance fund).\n\n                            SUMMARY\n\n             In the absence of statutory authority directing\n          the disposition of any surplus monies levied for\n          the interest and sinking fund after the redemption\n          of bonds outstanding, the El Paso County Water\n          Control and Improvement District No. 4 may refund\n          such excess to taxpayers or, in the event that\n          such refund is impracticable, transfer such monies\n          to the maintenance fund.\n\n\n\n\n                                           JIM     MATTOX\n                                           Attorney General of Texas\n\nTOM GREEN\nFirst Assistant Attorney General\n\nDAVID R.

Civ. App.\n- Beaumont 1939, writ dism’d judgmt co=.). We disagree both with the\nproposition and with the characterization of the Madeley case.\nMadeley concerned the disposition of surplus monies in the maintenance\nfund of an independent school district which the trustees sought to\nexpend on the erection and equipment of a school building. The court\nheld that the surplus monies in the maintenance fund ceased to be\ngoverned by the strictures imposed thereon by statutes specifying the\npurposes for which maintenance funds could be expended once the\npurpose of the statutes has been effectuated.\n\n         If and when the statutes cease to control the\n         fund, then it becomes a constitutional fund and\n         not a statutory fund, and may be used by the\n         trustees for the constitutional purposes; one of\n         the constitutional purposes is ‘the erection and\n         equipment of     school buildings’ within      the\n         district.    what we have said is in full\n         recognition of the legal proposition that the fund\n         collected for the support and maintenance of the\n         public free schools, to the extent that it is\n         needed for thnt purpose, can not be diverted to\n         any other purpose.\n\nMadeley v. Conroe Independent School District, supra at 934.\n\n     The following language in Madeley is that cited in support of the\nproposition that surplus monies in the interest and sinking fund may\nbe expended for any lawful purpose of the taxing unit.\n\n            The following illustration is in point on our\n         holding: Where a district has issued bonds and\n         voted a tax to retire them, what becomes of the\n         surplus of the tax when the bonds are retired?\n         Since it is not reasonable that the exact amount\n         of the bonds will be collected, on every bond\n         issue the trustees will have in their hands a\n         surplus. Again, a tax payer permits his tax to\n         become delinquent until after the bonds are\n         retired; when sued, can he defend on the ground\n         that the bonds for which the tax against his\n         property was levied have been paid off? When the\n         delinquent tax is collected, how shall it be\n         expended? These questions find their answer in\n         Sec. 3 of Art. 7 of the Constitution; where the\n         bonds hnve been paid off the statutes regulating\n         the expenditure of the funds for their payment\n         cease to control the power of the trustees in the\n         expenditure of the surplus, and its expenditure\n\n\n\n\n                                  p. 609\n\fHonorable Luther Jones - Page 4    (m-142)\n\n\n\n\n          rests in the discretion of the trustees, under\n          Sec. 3 of Art. 7 of the Constitution.\n\nId. For two reasons we conclude that such language is not dispositive\nof the issue before us. First, the paragraph is dicta. At issue in\nMadeley was a surplus in the maintenance fund, not in the interest and\nsinking fund.\n\n     Second, and more importantly, the court specifically held that\narticle VII, section 3 of the Texas Constitution permitted school\ndistricts to levy a maintenance tax for “the erection and equipment of\nschool buildings” within the district, as well as “for the further\nmaintenance of public free schools.” Tex. Const. art. VII, $3. The\ncourt noted that. for years, trustees of independent school  districts\nhad expended surplus monies in maintenance funds for erection of\npublic school buildings. The constitutional provisions under which\nwater control and improvement districts are created do not contain\nlanguage similar to that of article VII, section 3. See Water Code\n551.011. Article III, section 52 of the Texas Constitution authorizes\nthe legislature to permit political subdivisions to issue bonds for\ncertain specified purposes and to “levy and collect taxes to pay the\ninterest thereon and provide a sinking fund for the redemption\nthereof . . . .” Clearly, article III, section 52 contemplates the\ncreation of a discrete, segregated interest and sinking fund; there is\nno language which could be construed to permit the expenditure of any\nsurplus interest and sinking fund monies for any purpose other than\nthe payment of interest and the redemption of outstanding bonds.\n\n     Likewise, article XVI, section 59 of the Texas Constitution\nauthorizes the legislature to permit conservation and reclamation\ndistricts to issue bonds “as may be necessary to provide all\nimprovements and the maintenance thereof requisite to the achievement\nof the purposes of this amendment” and to levy and collect “all such\ntaxes, equitably distributed, as may be necessary for the payment   of\nthe interest and the creation of a sinking fund for the payment of\nsuch bonds; and also for the maintenance of such districts and\nimprovements . . . .‘I Again, it is clear that the constitution\ncontemplates the creation of at least two discrete funds, one for\nmaintenance of the districts and one for the payment of interest on\nand redemption of outstanding bonds. And again, there is no language\nin article III, section 52 which could be construed to pensit the\nexpenditure of surplus interest and sinking fund monies for any lawful\npurpose of the taxing unit.\n\n     There is admittedly a dearth of explicit, direct authority in\nthis area. Courts in other jurisdictions have held that surplus\nmonies in an interest and sinking fund can be expended after out-\nstanding bonds have been redeemed for purposes other than those for\nwhich the bonds were originally issued and sold, but only when such\nwas specifically provided by statute.

Tax Levy\n\n             (a) At the time bonds are voted, the board\n          shall levy a tax on all property inside the\n          district in a sufficient amount to redeem and\n          discharge the bonds at maturity.\n\n             (b) The board annually shall levy or have\n          assessed and collected taxes on all property\n          inside the district in a sufficient amount to pay\n          for the expenses of assessing and collecting the\n          taxes.\n\n            Cc) If a contract is made with the United\n         States, the board annually shall levy taxes on\n         property inside the district in a sufficient\n         amount to pay installments and interest as they\n         become due.\n\n             (d) The board may issue the bonds in serial\n          form or payable in installments, and the tax levy\n          shall be sufficient if it provides an amount\n\n\n\n                                  p. 611\n\fIIonorableLuther Jones - Page 6   (JM-142)\n\n\n\n\n         sufficient to pay the interest on the bonds, the\n         proportionate amount of the principal of the next\n         maturing bonds, and the expenses of assessing and\n         collecting the taxes for that year.     (Emphasis\n         added).\n\n     Section 51.434 of the code provides the following:\n\n          551.434. Adjustment of Tax Levy\n\n             (a) The tax levy wade in connection with the\n          issuance of bonds shall remain in force from year\n          to year until a new levy is made.\n\n             (b) The board may from time to time increase\n          or diminish the tax to adjust it for the taxable\n          values of the property subject to taxation by the\n          district and the amount required to be collected.\n\n             (c) The board shall raise an amount sufficient\n          to pay the annual interest of and principal on all\n          outstanding bonds. (Emphasis added).\n\n     It is suggested that Attorney General Opinion MW-97 (1979)\ncontrols this issue. In Attorney General Opinion MW-97 (1979). this\noffice declared that, in an instance in which the applicable statutes\nwere silent as to the disposition of any surplus interest and sinking\nfund monies after the redemption of bonds outstanding, such funds may\nbe expended only for the same \"public improvements\" for which the\nbonds   were   originally issued.     Quoting McQuillin, Municipal\nCorporations at Volume 15, 543.134, the opinion declared:\n\n          A sinking fund should be applied to the payment of\n          the principal and interest on the bonds which it\n          was created to service, and even though the bonds\n          have been declared void, cannot be diverted to\n          other purposes. Thus, it is an unlawful diversion\n          to transfer a sinking fund to the general\n          fund. . . . It has been held that an unallocated\n          surplus remaining after the payment of principal\n          and interest of outstanding bonds may be used for\n          the construction of a public improvement . . . .\n          (Emphasis added).\n\nThe case cited by McQuillin in support of the above underscored\nlanguage is King v. Duval County, B.        As we have already noted,\nthe rule in King is not a general rule of law with respect to the\ndisposition of surplus interest and sinking fund levies; the transfer\npermitted in King was specifically authorized by statute. Such is not\nthe case in the Water Code.         Attorney General Opinion MW-97,\n\n\n\n\n                                  p. 612\n\fHonorable Luther Jones - Page 7    (JM-142)\n\n\n\n\ntherefore, relied upon authority which does not support the\nproposition for which it was cited. Accordingly, to the extent to\nwhich Attorney General Opinion MW-97 conflicts with this opinion, it\nis hereby overruled.\n\n     In the absence of specific statutory authority, the prevalent\njudicial and legislative reasoning appears to be that such surplus\nmonies may be refunded to taxpayers, see, e.g., Diver v. Village of\nGlencoe, a;      City of Stuttgart v. McCuing,   234I,\".sW;.;\n                                                            eyett(Ark.\n1950). unless such refund would be impracticable.                , the\nsurplus levy may be transferred to the general maintenance fund. See\nMorton v. Baker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ark. 1973); Lawrence v. Jones.73\nS.W.2d 228 (Ark. 1958).\n\n     We conclude that, in the absence of statutory authority directing\nthe disposition of any surplus monies levied for the interest and\nsinking fund, the water district may refund such excess to taxpayers\nor. in the event that such refund is impracticable, transfer such\nmonies to the maintenance fund of .the district. We note that section\n51.352 of the Water Code specifies the purposes for which monies in\nmaintenance fund may be expended.       See also Water Code 951.351\n(provides that proceeds from the sale of bonds shall be deposited in\nthe construction fund and that, after the payment of obligations for\nwhich the bonds were issued, any remaining money in the construction\nfund may be transferred to the maintenance fund).\n\n                            SUMMARY\n\n             In the absence of statutory authority directing\n          the disposition of any surplus monies levied for\n          the interest and sinking fund after the redemption\n          of bonds outstanding, the El Paso County Water\n          Control and Improvement District No. 4 may refund\n          such excess to taxpayers or, in the event that\n          such refund is impracticable, transfer such monies\n          to the maintenance fund.\n\n\n\n\n                                           JIM     MATTOX\n                                           Attorney General of Texas\n\nTOM GREEN\nFirst Assistant Attorney General\n\nDAVID R.
