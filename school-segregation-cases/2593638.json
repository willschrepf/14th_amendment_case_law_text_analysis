(pp. 43–64), delivered a separate dissenting opinion.\n\n                                     _________________\n\n                                           OPINION\n                                     _________________\n\n       SUTTON, Circuit Judge. This is a case about change—and how best to handle it under\nthe United States Constitution. From the vantage point of 2014, it would now seem, the question\nis not whether American law will allow gay couples to marry; it is when and how that will\nhappen. That would not have seemed likely as recently as a dozen years ago. For better, for\nworse, or for more of the same, marriage has long been a social institution defined by\nrelationships between men and women. So long defined, the tradition is measured in millennia,\nnot centuries or decades. So widely shared, the tradition until recently had been adopted by all\ngovernments and major religions of the world.\n\n       But things change, sometimes quickly. Since 2003, nineteen States and the District of\nColumbia have expanded the definition of marriage to include gay couples, some through state\nlegislation, some through initiatives of the people, some through state court decisions, and some\nthrough the actions of state governors and attorneys general who opted not to appeal adverse\ncourt decisions. Nor does this momentum show any signs of slowing. Twelve of the nineteen\nStates that now recognize gay marriage did so in the last couple of years. On top of that, four\nfederal courts of appeals have compelled several other States to permit same-sex marriages under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                      Page 8\n\n       What remains is a debate about whether to allow the democratic processes begun in the\nStates to continue in the four States of the Sixth Circuit or to end them now by requiring all\nStates in the Circuit to extend the definition of marriage to encompass gay couples. Process and\nstructure matter greatly in American government. Indeed, they may be the most reliable, liberty-\nassuring guarantees of our system of government, requiring us to take seriously the route the\nUnited States Constitution contemplates for making such a fundamental change to such a\nfundamental social institution.\n\n       Of all the ways to resolve this question, one option is not available: a poll of the three\njudges on this panel, or for that matter all federal judges, about whether gay marriage is a good\nidea. Our judicial commissions did not come with such a sweeping grant of authority, one that\nwould allow just three of us—just two of us in truth—to make such a vital policy call for the\nthirty-two million citizens who live within the four States of the Sixth Circuit: Kentucky,\nMichigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. What we have authority to decide instead is a legal question:\nDoes the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibit a State from defining\nmarriage as a relationship between one man and one woman?\n\n       Through a mixture of common law decisions, statutes, and constitutional provisions, each\nState in the Sixth Circuit has long adhered to the traditional definition of marriage. Sixteen gay\nand lesbian couples claim that this definition violates their rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. The circumstances that gave rise to the challenges vary. Some involve a birth,\nothers a death.   Some involve concerns about property, taxes, and insurance, others death\ncertificates and rights to visit a partner or partner’s child in the hospital. Some involve a\ncouple’s effort to obtain a marriage license within their State, others an effort to achieve\nrecognition of a marriage solemnized in another State. All seek dignity and respect, the same\ndignity and respect given to marriages between opposite-sex couples. And all come down to the\nsame question: Who decides? Is this a matter that the National Constitution commits to\nresolution by the federal courts or leaves to the less expedient, but usually reliable, work of the\nstate democratic processes?\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                      Page 9\n\n                                                  I.\n\n        Michigan. One case comes from Michigan, where state law has defined marriage as a\nrelationship between a man and a woman since its territorial days. See An Act Regulating\nMarriages § 1 (1820), in 1 Laws of the Territory of Michigan 646, 646 (1871). The State\nreaffirmed this view in 1996 when it enacted a law that declared marriage “inherently a unique\nrelationship between a man and a woman.” Mich. Comp. Laws § 551.1. In 2004, after the\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court invalidated the Commonwealth’s prohibition on same-sex\nmarriage, Goodridge v. Dep’t of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003), nearly fifty-nine\npercent of Michigan voters opted to constitutionalize the State’s definition of marriage. “To\nsecure and preserve the benefits of marriage for our society and for future generations of\nchildren,” the amendment says, “the union of one man and one woman in marriage shall be the\nonly agreement recognized as a marriage or similar union for any purpose.” Mich. Const. art. I,\n§ 25.\n\n        April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, a lesbian couple living in Michigan, challenge the\nconstitutionality of this definition. Marriage was not their first objective. DeBoer and Rowse\neach had adopted children as single parents, and both wanted to serve as adoptive parents for the\nother partner’s children. Their initial complaint alleged that Michigan’s adoption laws violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The State moved to dismiss the\nlawsuit for lack of standing, and the district court tentatively agreed. Rather than dismissing the\naction, the court “invit[ed the] plaintiffs to seek leave to amend their complaint to . . . challenge”\nMichigan’s laws denying them a marriage license. DeBoer R. 151 at 3. DeBoer and Rowse\naccepted the invitation and filed a new complaint alleging that Michigan’s marriage laws\nviolated the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n        Both sets of parties moved for summary judgment. The district court concluded that the\ndispute raised “a triable issue of fact” over whether the “rationales” for the Michigan laws\nfurthered “a legitimate state interest,” and it held a nine-day trial on the issue. DeBoer R. 89 at\n4, 8. The plaintiffs’ experts testified that same-sex couples raise children as well as opposite-sex\ncouples, and that denying marriage to same-sex couples creates instabilities for their children and\nfamilies. The defendants’ experts testified that the evidence regarding the comparative success\nof children raised in same-sex households is inconclusive. The district court sided with the\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 10\n\nplaintiffs. It rejected all of the State’s bases for its marriage laws and concluded that the laws\nfailed to satisfy rational basis review.\n\n        Kentucky. Two cases challenge two aspects of Kentucky’s marriage laws. Early on,\nKentucky defined marriage as “the union of a man and a woman.”                Jones v. Hallahan,\n501 S.W.2d 588, 589 (Ky. 1973); see An Act for Regulating the Solemnization of Marriages § 1,\n1798 Ky. Acts 49, 49–50. In 1998, the Kentucky legislature codified the common law definition.\nThe statute says that “‘marriage’ refers only to the civil status, condition, or relation of one\n(1) man and one (1) woman united in law for life, for the discharge to each other and the\ncommunity of the duties legally incumbent upon those whose association is founded on the\ndistinction of sex.” Ky. Rev. Stat. § 402.005. In 2004, the Kentucky legislature proposed a\nconstitutional amendment providing that “[o]nly a marriage between one man and one woman\nshall be valid or recognized as a marriage in Kentucky.” Ky. Const. § 233A. Seventy-four\npercent of the voters approved the amendment.\n\n        Two groups of plaintiffs challenge these Kentucky laws. One group, the fortuitously\nnamed Love plaintiffs, challenges the Commonwealth’s marriage-licensing law. Two couples\nfiled that lawsuit: Timothy Love and Lawrence Ysunza, along with Maurice Blanchard and\nDominique James. Both couples claim that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits Kentucky from\ndenying them marriage licenses.\n\n        The other group, the Bourke plaintiffs, challenges the ban on recognizing out-of-state\nsame-sex marriages. Four same-sex couples filed the lawsuit: Gregory Bourke and Michael\nDeLeon; Jimmy Meade and Luther Barlowe; Randell Johnson and Paul Campion; and Kimberly\nFranklin and Tamera Boyd. All four couples were married outside Kentucky, and they contend\nthat the State’s recognition ban violates their due process and equal protection rights. Citing the\nhardships imposed on them by the recognition ban—loss of tax breaks, exclusion from intestacy\nlaws, loss of dignity—they seek to enjoin its enforcement.\n\n        The district court ruled for the plaintiffs in both cases. In Love, the court held that the\nCommonwealth could not justify its definition of marriage on rational basis grounds. It also\nthought that classifications based on sexual orientation should be subjected to intermediate\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 11\n\nscrutiny, which the Commonwealth also failed to satisfy. In Bourke, the court invalidated the\nrecognition ban on rational basis grounds.\n\n       Ohio. Two cases challenge Ohio’s refusal to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages.\nOhio also has long adhered to the traditional definition of marriage. See An Act Regulating\nMarriages § 1, 1803 Ohio Laws 31, 31; Carmichael v. State, 12 Ohio St. 553, 560 (1861). It\nreaffirmed this definition in 2004, when the legislature passed a Defense of Marriage Act, which\nsays that marriage “may only be entered into by one man and one woman.” Ohio Rev. Code\n§ 3101.01(A). “Any marriage entered into by persons of the same sex in any other jurisdiction,”\nit adds, “shall be considered and treated in all respects as having no legal force or effect.” Id.\n§ 3101.01(C)(2). Later that same year, sixty-two percent of Ohio voters approved an amendment\nto the Ohio Constitution along the same lines. As amended, the Ohio Constitution says that Ohio\nrecognizes only “a union between one man and one woman” as a valid marriage. Ohio Const.\nart. XV, § 11.\n\n       Two groups of plaintiffs challenge these Ohio laws. The first group, the Obergefell\nplaintiffs, focuses on one application of the law. They argue that Ohio’s refusal to recognize\ntheir out-of-state marriages on Ohio-issued death certificates violates due process and equal\nprotection. Two same-sex couples in long-term, committed relationships filed the lawsuit:\nJames Obergefell and John Arthur; and David Michener and William Herbert Ives. All four of\nthem are from Ohio and were married in other States. When Arthur and Ives died, the State\nwould not list Obergefell and Michener as spouses on their death certificates. Obergefell and\nMichener sought an injunction to require the State to list them as spouses on the certificates.\nRobert Grunn, a funeral director, joined the lawsuit, asking the court to protect his right to\nrecognize same-sex marriages on other death certificates.\n\n       The second group, the Henry plaintiffs, raises a broader challenge. They argue that\nOhio’s refusal to recognize out-of-state marriages between same-sex couples violates the\nFourteenth Amendment no matter what marital benefit is affected. The Henry case involves four\nsame-sex couples, all married in other States, who want Ohio to recognize their marriages on\ntheir children’s birth certificates. Three of the couples (Brittani Henry and Brittni Rogers;\nNicole and Pam Yorksmith; Kelly Noe and Kelly McCracken) gave birth to children in Ohio and\nwish to have both of their names listed on each child’s birth certificate rather than just the child’s\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 12\n\nbiological mother. The fourth couple (Joseph Vitale and Robert Talmas) lives in New York and\nadopted a child born in Ohio. They seek to amend their son’s Ohio birth certificate so that it lists\nboth of them as parents.\n\n       The district court granted the plaintiffs relief in both cases. In Obergefell, the court\nconcluded that the Fourteenth Amendment protects a fundamental right to keep existing marital\nrelationships intact, and that the State failed to justify its law under heightened scrutiny. The\ncourt likewise concluded that classifications based on sexual orientation deserve heightened\nscrutiny under equal protection, and that Ohio failed to justify its refusal to recognize the\ncouples’ existing marriages. Even under rational basis review, the court added, the State came\nup short. In Henry, the district court reached many of the same conclusions and expanded its\nrecognition remedy to encompass all married same-sex couples and all legal incidents of\nmarriage under Ohio law.\n\n       Tennessee. The Tennessee case is of a piece with the two Ohio cases and one of the\nKentucky cases, as it too challenges the State’s same-sex-marriage recognition ban. Tennessee\nhas always defined marriage in traditional terms. See An Act Concerning Marriages § 3 (1741),\nin Public Acts of the General Assembly of North-Carolina and Tennessee 46, 46 (1815). In\n1996, the Tennessee legislature reaffirmed “that the historical institution and legal contract\nsolemnizing the relationship of one (1) man and one (1) woman shall be the only legally\nrecognized marital contract in this state in order to provide the unique and exclusive rights and\nprivileges to marriage.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-3-113(a). In 2006, the State amended its\nconstitution to incorporate the existing definition of marriage. See Tenn. Const. art. XI, § 18.\nEighty percent of the voters supported the amendment.\n\n       Three same-sex couples, all in committed relationships, challenge the recognition ban:\nValeria Tanco and Sophy Jesty; Ijpe DeKoe and Thomas Kostura; and Johno Espejo and\nMatthew Mansell. All three couples were legally married in other States. The district court\npreliminarily enjoined the law.     Relying on district court decisions within the circuit and\nelsewhere, the court concluded that the couples likely would show that Tennessee’s ban failed to\nsatisfy rational basis review. The remaining preliminary injunction factors, the court held, also\nweighed in the plaintiffs’ favor.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 13\n\n        All four States appealed the decisions against them.\n\n                                                II.\n\n        Does the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment require States to expand the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples?\nThe Michigan appeal (DeBoer) presents this threshold question, and so does one of the Kentucky\nappeals (Love). Caselaw offers many ways to think about the issue.\n\n                                                A.\n\n        Perspective of an intermediate court.      Start with a recognition of our place in the\nhierarchy of the federal courts. As an “inferior” court (the Constitution’s preferred term, not\nours), a federal court of appeals begins by asking what the Supreme Court’s precedents require\non the topic at hand. Just such a precedent confronts us.\n\n        In the early 1970s, a Methodist minister married Richard Baker and James McConnell in\nMinnesota. Afterwards, they sought a marriage license from the State. When the clerk of the\nstate court denied the request, the couple filed a lawsuit claiming that the denial of their request\nviolated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Baker v.\nNelson, 191 N.W.2d 185, 186 (Minn. 1971). The Minnesota Supreme Court rejected both\nclaims. As for the due process claim, the state court reasoned: “The institution of marriage as a\nunion of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreation and rearing of children within a\nfamily, is as old as the book of Genesis. . . . This historic institution manifestly is more deeply\nfounded than the asserted contemporary concept of marriage and societal interests for which\npetitioners contend. The due process clause . . . is not a charter for restructuring it by judicial\nlegislation.”   Id.   As for the equal protection claim, the court reasoned:         “[T]he state’s\nclassification of persons authorized to marry” does not create an “irrational or invidious\ndiscrimination. . . . [T]hat the state does not impose upon heterosexual married couples a\ncondition that they have a proved capacity or declared willingness to procreate . . . [creates only\na] theoretically imperfect [classification] . . . [and] ‘abstract symmetry’ is not demanded by the\nFourteenth Amendment.” Id. at 187. The Supreme Court’s decision four years earlier in Loving\nv. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), which invalidated Virginia’s ban on interracial marriages, did not\nchange this conclusion. “[I]n commonsense and in a constitutional sense,” the state court\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 14\n\nexplained, “there is a clear distinction between a marital restriction based merely upon race and\none based upon the fundamental difference in sex.” Baker, 191 N.W.2d at 187.\n\n       Baker and McConnell appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The Court rejected\ntheir challenge, issuing a one-line order stating that the appeal did not raise “a substantial federal\nquestion.” Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810, 810 (1972). This type of summary decision, it is true,\ndoes not bind the Supreme Court in later cases. But it does confine lower federal courts in later\ncases. It matters not whether we think the decision was right in its time, remains right today, or\nwill be followed by the Court in the future. Only the Supreme Court may overrule its own\nprecedents, and we remain bound even by its summary decisions “until such time as the Court\ninforms [us] that [we] are not.” Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 345 (1975) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Court has yet to inform us that we are not, and we have no license to\nengage in a guessing game about whether the Court will change its mind or, more aggressively,\nto assume authority to overrule Baker ourselves.\n\n       But that was then; this is now. And now, claimants insist, must account for United States\nv. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), which invalidated the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, a\nlaw that refused for purposes of federal statutory benefits to respect gay marriages authorized by\nstate law. Yet Windsor does not answer today’s question. The decision never mentions Baker,\nmuch less overrules it. And the outcomes of the cases do not clash. Windsor invalidated a\nfederal law that refused to respect state laws permitting gay marriage, while Baker upheld the\nright of the people of a State to define marriage as they see it. To respect one decision does not\nslight the other. Nor does Windsor’s reasoning clash with Baker. Windsor hinges on the\nDefense of Marriage Act’s unprecedented intrusion into the States’ authority over domestic\nrelations. Id. at 2691–92. Before the Act’s passage in 1996, the federal government had\ntraditionally relied on state definitions of marriage instead of purporting to define marriage itself.\nId. at 2691. That premise does not work—it runs the other way—in a case involving a challenge\nin federal court to state laws defining marriage. The point of Windsor was to prevent the Federal\nGovernment from “divest[ing]” gay couples of “a dignity and status of immense import” that\nNew York’s extension of the definition of marriage gave them, an extension that “without doubt”\nany State could provide. Id. at 2692, 2695. Windsor made explicit that it does not answer\ntoday’s question, telling us that the “opinion and its holding are confined to . . . lawful\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 15\n\nmarriages” already protected by some of the States. Id. at 2696. Bringing the matter to a close,\nthe Court held minutes after releasing Windsor that procedural obstacles in Hollingsworth v.\nPerry, 133 S. Ct. 2652 (2013), prevented it from considering the validity of state marriage laws.\nSaying that the Court declined in Hollingsworth to overrule Baker openly but decided in Windsor\nto overrule it by stealth makes an unflattering and unfair estimate of the Justices’ candor.\n\n        Even if Windsor did not overrule Baker by name, the claimants point out, lower courts\nstill may rely on “doctrinal developments” in the aftermath of a summary disposition as a ground\nfor not following the decision. Hicks, 422 U.S. at 344. And Windsor, they say, together with\nLawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), and Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), permit us to\ncast Baker aside. But this reading of “doctrinal developments” would be a groundbreaking\ndevelopment of its own. From the perspective of a lower court, summary dispositions remain\n“controlling precedent, unless and until re-examined by [the Supreme] Court.” Tully v. Griffin,\nInc., 429 U.S. 68, 74 (1976); see Hicks, 422 U.S. at 343–45. And the Court has told us to treat\nthe two types of decisions, whether summary dispositions or full-merits decisions, the same,\n“prevent[ing] lower courts” in both settings “from coming to opposite conclusions on the precise\nissues presented and necessarily decided by those actions.” Mandel v. Bradley, 432 U.S. 173,\n176 (1977). Lest doubt remain, the Court has also told us not to ignore its decisions even when\nthey are in tension with a new line of cases. “If a precedent of this Court has direct application\nin a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of\nAppeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of\noverruling its own decisions.” Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477,\n484 (1989); see Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997).\n\n        Just two scenarios, then, permit us to ignore a Supreme Court decision, whatever its\nform:   when the Court has overruled the decision by name (if, say, Windsor had directly\noverruled Baker) or when the Court has overruled the decision by outcome (if, say,\nHollingsworth had invalidated the California law without mentioning Baker).              Any other\napproach returns us to a world in which the lower courts may anticipatorily overrule all manner\nof Supreme Court decisions based on counting-to-five predictions, perceived trajectories in the\ncaselaw, or, worst of all, new appointments to the Court. In the end, neither of the two\npreconditions for ignoring Supreme Court precedent applies here. Windsor as shown does not\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 16\n\nmention Baker, and it clarifies that its “opinion and holding” do not govern the States’ authority\nto define marriage. Hollingsworth was dismissed. And neither Lawrence nor Romer mentions\nBaker, and neither is inconsistent with its outcome. The one invalidates a State’s criminal\nantisodomy law and explains that the case “does not involve . . . formal recognition” of same-sex\nrelationships.   Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578.         The other invalidates a “[s]weeping” and\n“unprecedented” state law that prohibited local communities from passing laws that protect\ncitizens from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Romer, 517 U.S. at 627, 633, 635–36.\n\n       That brings us to another one-line order. On October 6, 2014, the Supreme Court\n“denied” the “petitions for writs of certiorari” in 1,575 cases, seven of which arose from\nchallenges to decisions of the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits that recognized a\nconstitutional right to same-sex marriage. But this kind of action (or inaction) “imports no\nexpression of opinion upon the merits of the case, as the bar has been told many times.” United\nStates v. Carver, 260 U.S. 482, 490 (1923). “The ‘variety of considerations [that] underlie\ndenials of the writ’ counsels against according denials of certiorari any precedential value.”\nTeague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 296 (1989) (internal citation omitted). Just as the Court’s three\ndecisions to stay those same court of appeals decisions over the past year, all without a registered\ndissent, did not end the debate on this issue, so too the Court’s decision to deny certiorari in all\nof these appeals, all without a registered dissent, does not end the debate either. A decision not\nto decide is a decision not to decide.\n\n       But don’t these denials of certiorari signal that, from the Court’s perspective, the right to\nsame-sex marriage is inevitable? Maybe; maybe not. Even if we grant the premise and assume\nthat same-sex marriage will be recognized one day in all fifty States, that does not tell us how—\nwhether through the courts or through democracy. And, if through the courts, that does not tell\nus why—whether through one theory of constitutional invalidity or another. Four courts of\nappeals thus far have recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. They agree on one\nthing: the result. But they reach that outcome in many ways, often more than one way in the\nsame decision. See Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 F.3d 352 (4th Cir. 2014) (fundamental rights); Baskin\nv. Bogan, 766 F.3d 648 (7th Cir. 2014) (rational basis, animus); Latta v. Otter, No. 14-35420,\n2014 WL 4977682 (9th Cir. Oct. 7, 2014) (animus, fundamental rights, suspect classification);\nBishop v. Smith, 760 F.3d 1070 (10th Cir. 2014) (fundamental rights); Kitchen v. Herbert,\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 17\n\n755 F.3d 1193 (10th Cir. 2014) (same). The Court’s certiorari denials tell us nothing about the\ndemocracy-versus-litigation path to same-sex marriage, and they tell us nothing about the\nvalidity of any of these theories. If a federal court denies the people suffrage over an issue long\nthought to be within their power, they deserve an explanation. We, for our part, cannot find one,\nas several other judges have concluded as well. See Bostic, 760 F.3d at 385–98 (Niemeyer, J.,\ndissenting); Kitchen, 755 F.3d at 1230–40 (Kelly, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);\nConde-Vidal v. Garcia-Padilla, No. 14-1253-PG, 2014 WL 5361987 (D.P.R. Oct. 21, 2014);\nRobicheaux v. Caldwell, 2 F. Supp. 3d 910 (E.D. La. 2014).\n\n       There are many ways, as these lower court decisions confirm, to look at this question:\noriginalism; rational basis review; animus; fundamental rights; suspect classifications; evolving\nmeaning. The parties in one way or another have invoked them all. Not one of the plaintiffs’\ntheories, however, makes the case for constitutionalizing the definition of marriage and for\nremoving the issue from the place it has been since the founding: in the hands of state voters.\n\n                                                B.\n\n       Original meaning. All Justices, past and present, start their assessment of a case about\nthe meaning of a constitutional provision by looking at how the provision was understood by the\npeople who ratified it. If we think of the Constitution as a covenant between the governed and\nthe governors, between the people and their political leaders, it is easy to appreciate the force of\nthis basic norm of constitutional interpretation—that the originally understood meaning of the\ncharter generally will be the lasting meaning of the charter. When two individuals sign a\ncontract to sell a house, no one thinks that, years down the road, one party to the contract may\nchange the terms of the deal. That is why the parties put the agreement in writing and signed it\npublicly—to prevent changed perceptions and needs from changing the guarantees in the\nagreement.    So it normally goes with the Constitution:        The written charter cements the\nlimitations on government into an unbending bulwark, not a vane alterable whenever alterations\noccur—unless and until the people, like contracting parties, choose to change the contract\nthrough the agreed-upon mechanisms for doing so. See U.S. Const. art. V. If American lawyers\nin all manner of settings still invoke the original meaning of Magna Carta, a Charter for England\nin 1215, surely it is not too much to ask that they (and we) take seriously the original meaning of\nthe United States Constitution, a Charter for this country in 1789. Any other approach, too\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 18\n\nlightly followed, converts federal judges from interpreters of the document into newly\ncommissioned authors of it.\n\n       Many precedents gauging individual rights and national power, leading to all manner of\noutcomes, confirm the import of original meaning in legal debates. See, e.g., Marbury v.\nMadison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 173–80 (1803); McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.)\n316, 401–25 (1819); Legal Tender Cases, 79 U.S. 457, 536–38 (1870); Myers v. United States,\n272 U.S. 52, 110–39 (1926); INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 944–59 (1983); Plaut v. Spendthrift\nFarm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 218–25 (1995); Washington v. Glucksburg, 521 U.S. 702, 710–19\n(1997); Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 42–50 (2004); Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723,\n739–46 (2008); Giles v. California, 554 U.S. 353, 358–61 (2008); District of Columbia v. Heller,\n554 U.S. 570, 576–600 (2008).\n\n       In trying to figure out the original meaning of a provision, it is fair to say, the line\nbetween interpretation and evolution blurs from time to time. That is an occupational hazard for\njudges when it comes to old or generally worded provisions. Yet that knotty problem does not\nconfront us. Yes, the Fourteenth Amendment is old; the people ratified it in 1868. And yes, it is\ngenerally worded; it says: “[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of\nthe laws.” Nobody in this case, however, argues that the people who adopted the Fourteenth\nAmendment understood it to require the States to change the definition of marriage.\n\n       Tradition reinforces the point. Only months ago, the Supreme Court confirmed the\nsignificance of long-accepted usage in constitutional interpretation. In one case, the Court held\nthat the customary practice of opening legislative meetings with prayer alone proves the\nconstitutional permissibility of legislative prayer, quite apart from how that practice might fare\nunder the most up-to-date Establishment Clause test. Town of Greece v. Galloway, 134 S. Ct.\n1811, 1818–20 (2014). In another case, the Court interpreted the Recess Appointments Clause\nbased in part on long-accepted usage. NLRB v. Noel Canning, 134 S. Ct. 2550, 2559–60 (2014).\nApplied here, this approach permits today’s marriage laws to stand until the democratic\nprocesses say they should stand no more. From the founding of the Republic to 2003, every\nState defined marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman, meaning that the\nFourteenth Amendment permits, though it does not require, States to define marriage in that way.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                      Page 19\n\n                                                  C.\n\n       Rational basis review. Doctrine leads to the same place as history. A first requirement of\nany law, whether under the Due Process or Equal Protection Clause, is that it rationally advance\na legitimate government policy.       Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97 (1979).           Two words\n(“judicial restraint,” FCC v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 314 (1993)) and one principle\n(trust in the people that “even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the\ndemocratic process,” Vance, 440 U.S. at 97) tell us all we need to know about the light touch\njudges should use in reviewing laws under this standard. So long as judges can conceive of some\n“plausible” reason for the law—any plausible reason, even one that did not motivate the\nlegislators who enacted it—the law must stand, no matter how unfair, unjust, or unwise the\njudges may consider it as citizens. Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 330 (1993); Nordlinger v. Hahn,\n505 U.S. 1, 11, 17–18 (1992).\n\n       A dose of humility makes us hesitant to condemn as unconstitutionally irrational a view\nof marriage shared not long ago by every society in the world, shared by most, if not all, of our\nancestors, and shared still today by a significant number of the States. Hesitant, yes; but still a\nrational basis, some rational basis, must exist for the definition. What is it? Two at a minimum\nsuffice to meet this low bar. One starts from the premise that governments got into the business\nof defining marriage, and remain in the business of defining marriage, not to regulate love but to\nregulate sex, most especially the intended and unintended effects of male-female intercourse.\nImagine a society without marriage. It does not take long to envision problems that might result\nfrom an absence of rules about how to handle the natural effects of male-female intercourse:\nchildren. May men and women follow their procreative urges wherever they take them? Who is\nresponsible for the children that result? How many mates may an individual have? How does\none decide which set of mates is responsible for which set of children? That we rarely think\nabout these questions nowadays shows only how far we have come and how relatively stable our\nsociety is, not that States have no explanation for creating such rules in the first place.\n\n       Once one accepts a need to establish such ground rules, and most especially a need to\ncreate stable family units for the planned and unplanned creation of children, one can well\nappreciate why the citizenry would think that a reasonable first concern of any society is the need\nto regulate male-female relationships and the unique procreative possibilities of them. One way\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 20\n\nto pursue this objective is to encourage couples to enter lasting relationships through subsidies\nand other benefits and to discourage them from ending such relationships through these and other\nmeans. People may not need the government’s encouragement to have sex. And they may not\nneed the government’s encouragement to propagate the species. But they may well need the\ngovernment’s encouragement to create and maintain stable relationships within which children\nmay flourish. It is not society’s laws or for that matter any one religion’s laws, but nature’s laws\n(that men and women complement each other biologically), that created the policy imperative.\nAnd governments typically are not second-guessed under the Constitution for prioritizing how\nthey tackle such issues. Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 486–87 (1970).\n\n       No doubt, that is not the only way people view marriage today. Over time, marriage has\ncome to serve another value—to solemnize relationships characterized by love, affection, and\ncommitment.     Gay couples, no less than straight couples, are capable of sharing such\nrelationships. And gay couples, no less than straight couples, are capable of raising children and\nproviding stable families for them. The quality of such relationships, and the capacity to raise\nchildren within them, turns not on sexual orientation but on individual choices and individual\ncommitment. All of this supports the policy argument made by many that marriage laws should\nbe extended to gay couples, just as nineteen States have done through their own sovereign\npowers. Yet it does not show that the States, circa 2014, suddenly must look at this policy issue\nin just one way on pain of violating the Constitution.\n\n       The signature feature of rational basis review is that governments will not be placed in\nthe dock for doing too much or for doing too little in addressing a policy question. Id. In a\nmodern sense, crystallized at some point in the last ten years, many people now critique state\nmarriage laws for doing too little—for being underinclusive by failing to extend the definition of\nmarriage to gay couples. Fair enough. But rational basis review does not permit courts to\ninvalidate laws every time a new and allegedly better way of addressing a policy emerges, even a\nbetter way supported by evidence and, in the Michigan case, by judicial factfinding.              If\nlegislative choices may rest on “rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data,”\nBeach Commc’ns, 508 U.S. at 315, it is hard to see the point of premising a ruling of\nunconstitutionality on factual findings made by one unelected federal judge that favor a different\npolicy. Rational basis review does not empower federal courts to “subject” legislative line-\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 21\n\ndrawing to “courtroom” factfinding designed to show that legislatures have done too much or too\nlittle. Id.\n\n        What we are left with is this: By creating a status (marriage) and by subsidizing it (e.g.,\nwith tax-filing privileges and deductions), the States created an incentive for two people who\nprocreate together to stay together for purposes of rearing offspring. That does not convict the\nStates of irrationality, only of awareness of the biological reality that couples of the same sex do\nnot have children in the same way as couples of opposite sexes and that couples of the same sex\ndo not run the risk of unintended offspring. That explanation, still relevant today, suffices to\nallow the States to retain authority over an issue they have regulated from the beginning.\n\n        To take another rational explanation for the decision of many States not to expand the\ndefinition of marriage, a State might wish to wait and see before changing a norm that our\nsociety (like all others) has accepted for centuries. That is not preserving tradition for its own\nsake. No one here claims that the States’ original definition of marriage was unconstitutional\nwhen enacted. The plaintiffs’ claim is that the States have acted irrationally in standing by the\ntraditional definition in the face of changing social mores. Yet one of the key insights of\nfederalism is that it permits laboratories of experimentation—accent on the plural—allowing one\nState to innovate one way, another State another, and a third State to assess the trial and error\nover time. As a matter of state law, the possibility of gay marriage became real in 2003 with the\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court’s decision in Goodridge. Eleven years later, the clock\nhas not run on assessing the benefits and burdens of expanding the definition of marriage.\nEleven years indeed is not even the right timeline. The fair question is whether in 2004, one year\nafter Goodridge, Michigan voters could stand by the traditional definition of marriage. How can\nwe say that the voters acted irrationally for sticking with the seen benefits of thousands of years\nof adherence to the traditional definition of marriage in the face of one year of experience with a\nnew definition of marriage? A State still assessing how this has worked, whether in 2004 or\n2014, is not showing irrationality, just a sense of stability and an interest in seeing how the new\ndefinition has worked elsewhere. Even today, the only thing anyone knows for sure about the\nlong-term impact of redefining marriage is that they do not know. A Burkean sense of caution\ndoes not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, least of all when measured by a timeline less than a\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 22\n\ndozen years long and when assessed by a system of government designed to foster step-by-step,\nnot sudden winner-take-all, innovations to policy problems.\n\n       In accepting these justifications for the four States’ marriage laws, we do not deny the\nfoolish, sometimes offensive, inconsistencies that have haunted marital legislation from time to\ntime. States will hand some people a marriage license no matter how often they have divorced or\nremarried, apparently on the theory that practice makes perfect. States will not even prevent an\nindividual from remarrying the same person three or four times, where practice no longer seems\nto be the issue. With love and commitment nowhere to be seen, States will grant a marriage\nlicense to two friends who wish to share in the tax and other material benefits of marriage, at\nleast until the State’s no-fault divorce laws allow them to exit the partnership freely. And States\nallow couples to continue procreating no matter how little stability, safety, and love they provide\nthe children they already have. Nor has unjustified sanctimony stayed off the stage when it\ncomes to marital legislation—with monogamists who “do not monog” criticizing alleged\npolygamists who “do not polyg.” See Paul B. Beers, Pennsylvania Politics Today and Yesterday\n51 (1980).\n\n       How, the claimants ask, could anyone possibly be unworthy of this civil institution?\nAren’t gay and straight couples both capable of honoring this civil institution in some cases and\nof messing it up in others? All of this, however, proves much too much. History is replete with\nexamples of love, sex, and marriage tainted by hypocrisy. Without it, half of the world’s\nliterature, and three-quarters of its woe, would disappear. Throughout, we have never leveraged\nthese inconsistencies about deeply personal, sometimes existential, views of marriage into a\nground for constitutionalizing the field. Instead, we have allowed state democratic forces to fix\nthe problems as they emerge and as evolving community mores show they should be fixed.\nEven if we think about today’s issue and today’s alleged inconsistencies solely from the\nperspective of the claimants in this case, it is difficult to call that formula, already coming to\nterms with a new view of marriage, a failure.\n\n       Any other approach would create line-drawing problems of its own. Consider how\nplaintiffs’ love-and-commitment definition of marriage would fare under their own rational basis\ntest. Their definition does too much because it fails to account for the reality that no State in the\ncountry requires couples, whether gay or straight, to be in love. Their definition does too little\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818         DeBoer v. Snyder                      Page 23\n\nbecause it fails to account for plural marriages, where there is no reason to think that three or\nfour adults, whether gay, bisexual, or straight, lack the capacity to share love, affection, and\ncommitment, or for that matter lack the capacity to be capable (and more plentiful) parents to\nboot. If it is constitutionally irrational to stand by the man-woman definition of marriage, it must\nbe constitutionally irrational to stand by the monogamous definition of marriage. Plaintiffs have\nno answer to the point. What they might say they cannot: They might say that tradition or\ncommunity mores provide a rational basis for States to stand by the monogamy definition of\nmarriage, but they cannot say that because that is exactly what they claim is illegitimate about\nthe States’ male-female definition of marriage. The predicament does not end there. No State is\nfree of marriage policies that go too far in some directions and not far enough in others, making\nall of them vulnerable—if the claimants’ theory of rational basis review prevails.\n\n         Several cases illustrate just how seriously the federal courts must take the line-drawing\ndeference owed the democratic process under rational basis review. Massachusetts Board of\nRetirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307 (1976), holds that a State may require law enforcement\nofficers to retire without exception at age fifty, in order to assure the physical fitness of its police\nforce.   If a rough correlation between age and strength suffices to uphold exception-free\nretirement ages (even though some fifty-year-olds swim/bike/run triathlons), why doesn’t a\ncorrelation between male-female intercourse and procreation suffice to uphold traditional\nmarriage laws (even though some straight couples don’t have kids and many gay couples do)?\nArmour v. City of Indianapolis, 132 S. Ct. 2073 (2012), says that if a city cancels a tax, the\nbureaucratic hassle of issuing refunds entitles it to keep money already collected from citizens\nwho paid early. If administrative convenience amounts to an adequate public purpose, why not a\nrough sense of social stability? More deferential still, Kotch v. Board of River Port Pilot\nCommissioners, 330 U.S. 552 (1947), concludes that a State’s interest in maintaining close ties\namong those who steer ships in its ports justifies denying pilotage licenses to anyone who isn’t a\nfriend or relative of an incumbent pilot. Can we honestly say that traditional marriage laws\ninvolve more irrationality than nepotism?\n\n         The debate over marriage of course has another side, and we cannot deny the costs to the\nplaintiffs of allowing the States to work through this profound policy debate. The traditional\ndefinition of marriage denies gay couples the opportunity to publicly solemnize, to say nothing\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 24\n\nof subsidize, their relationships under state law. In addition to depriving them of this status, it\ndeprives them of benefits that range from the profound (the right to visit someone in a hospital as\na spouse or parent) to the mundane (the right to file joint tax returns). These harms affect not\nonly gay couples but also their children. Do the benefits of standing by the traditional definition\nof marriage make up for these costs? The question demands an answer—but from elected\nlegislators, not life-tenured judges. Our task under the Supreme Court’s precedents is to decide\nwhether the law has some conceivable basis, not to gauge how that rationale stacks up against\nthe arguments on the other side. Respect for democratic control over this traditional area of state\nexpertise ensures that “a statewide deliberative process that enable[s] its citizens to discuss and\nweigh arguments for and against same-sex marriage” can have free and reasonable rein.\nWindsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2689.\n\n                                                D.\n\n       Animus. Given the broad deference owed the States under the democracy-reinforcing\nnorms of rational basis review, the cases in which the Supreme Court has struck down a state law\non that basis are few. When the Court has taken this step, it usually has been due to the novelty\nof the law and the targeting of a single group for disfavored treatment under it. In one case, a\ncity enacted a new zoning code with the none-too-subtle purpose of closing down a home for the\nintellectually disabled in a neighborhood that apparently wanted nothing to do with them. The\nreality that the code applied only to homes for the intellectually disabled—and not to other\ndwellings such as fraternity houses—led the Court to invalidate the regulation on the ground that\nthe city had based it upon “an irrational prejudice against the mentally retarded.” City of\nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 450 (1985). In another case, a statewide\ninitiative denied gays, and gays alone, access to the protection of the State’s existing\nantidiscrimination laws. The novelty of the law, coupled with the distance between the reach of\nthe law and any legitimate interest it might serve, showed that the law was “born of animosity\ntoward” gays and suggested a design to make gays “unequal to everyone else.” Romer, 517 U.S.\nat 634–35.\n\n       None of the statewide initiatives at issue here fits this pattern. The four initiatives,\nenacted between 2004 and 2006, codified a long-existing, widely held social norm already\nreflected in state law. “[M]arriage between a man and a woman,” as the Court reminded us just\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 25\n\nlast year, “had been thought of by most people as essential to the very definition of that term and\nto its role and function throughout the history of civilization.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2689.\n\n       Neither was the decision to place the definition of marriage in a State’s constitution\nunusual, nor did it otherwise convey the kind of malice or unthinking prejudice the\nConstitution prohibits. Nineteen States did the same thing during that period. Human Rights\nCampaign Found., Equality from State to State 2006, at 13–14 (2006), available at\nhttp://s3.amazonaws.com/hrc-assets//files/assets/resources/StateToState2007.pdf.      And if there\nwas one concern animating the initiatives, it was the fear that the courts would seize control over\nan issue that people of good faith care deeply about. If that is animus, the term has no useful\nmeaning.\n\n       Who in retrospect can blame the voters for having this fear? By then, several state courts\nhad altered their States’ traditional definitions of marriage under the States’ constitutions. Since\nthen, more have done the same. Just as state judges have the authority to construe a state\nconstitution as they see fit, so do the people have the right to overrule such decisions or preempt\nthem as they see fit. Nor is there anything static about this process. In some States, the people\nhave since re-amended their constitutions to broaden the category of those eligible to marry.\nIn other States, the people seemed primed to do the same but for now have opted to take a wait-\nand-see approach of their own as federal litigation proceeds. See, e.g., Wesley Lowery, Same-\nSex Marriage Is Gaining Momentum, but Some Advocates Don’t Want It on the Ballot in\nOhio, Wash. Post (June 14, 2014), http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/same-sex-marriage-\nis-gaining-momentum-but-ohio-advocates-dont-want-it-on-the-ballot/2014/06/14/a090452a-\ne77e-11e3-afc6-a1dd9407abcf_story.html (explaining that Ohio same-sex marriage advocates\nopted not to place the question on the 2014 state ballot despite collecting nearly twice the\nnumber of required signatures). What the Court recently said about another statewide initiative\nthat people care passionately about applies with equal vigor here: “Deliberative debate on\nsensitive issues such as racial preferences all too often may shade into rancor. But that does not\njustify removing certain court-determined issues from the voters’ reach. Democracy does not\npresume that some subjects are either too divisive or too profound for public debate.” Schuette v.\nCoal. to Defend Affirmative Action, 134 S. Ct. 1623, 1638 (2014). “It is demeaning to the\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 26\n\ndemocratic process to presume that the voters are not capable of deciding an issue of this\nsensitivity on decent and rational grounds.” Id. at 1637.\n\n       What of the possibility that other motivations affected the amendment process in the four\nStates? If assessing the motives of multimember legislatures is difficult, assessing the motives of\nall voters in a statewide initiative strains judicial competence. The number of people who\nsupported each initiative—Michigan (2.7 million), Kentucky (1.2 million), Ohio (3.3 million),\nand Tennessee (1.4 million)—was large and surely diverse. In addition to the proper role of the\ncourts in a democracy, many other factors presumably influenced the voters who supported and\nopposed these amendments: that some politicians favored the amendment and others opposed it;\nthat some faith groups favored the amendment and others opposed it; that some thought the\namendment would strengthen families and others thought it would weaken them or were not\nsure; that some thought the amendment would be good for children and others thought it would\nnot be or were not sure; and that some thought the amendment would preserve a long-established\ndefinition of marriage and others thought it was time to accommodate gay couples. Even a\nrough sense of morality likely affected voters, with some thinking it immoral to exclude gay\ncouples and others thinking the opposite.        For most people, whether for or against the\namendment, the truth of why they did what they did is assuredly complicated, making it\nimpossible to pin down any one consideration, as opposed to a rough aggregation of factors, as\nmotivating them. How in this setting can we indict the 2.7 million Michigan voters who\nsupported the amendment in 2004, less than one year after the first state supreme court\nrecognized a constitutional right to gay marriage, for favoring the amendment for prejudicial\nreasons and for prejudicial reasons alone? Any such conclusion cannot be squared with the\nbenefit of the doubt customarily given voters and legislatures under rational basis review. Even\nthe gay-rights community, remember, was not of one mind about taking on the benefits and\nburdens of marriage until the early 1990s. See George Chauncey, Why Marriage? The History\nShaping Today’s Debate over Gay Equality 58, 88 (2004); Michael J. Klarman, From the Closet\nto the Altar: Courts, Backlash, and the Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage 48–52 (2013). A decade\nlater, a State’s voters should not be taken to task for failing to be of one mind about the issue\nthemselves.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 27\n\n          Some equanimity is in order in assessing the motives of voters who invoked a\nconstitutionally respected vehicle for change and for resistance to change: direct democracy.\nSee Pac. States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U.S. 118, 151 (1912). Just as gay individuals are\nno longer abstractions, neither should we treat States as abstractions. Behind these initiatives\nwere real people who teach our children, create our jobs, and defend our shores. Some of these\npeople supported the initiative in 2004; some did not. It is no less unfair to paint the proponents\nof the measures as a monolithic group of hate-mongers than it is to paint the opponents as a\nmonolithic group trying to undo American families. “Tolerance,” like respect and dignity, is\nbest traveled on a “two-way street.” Ward v. Polite, 667 F.3d 727, 735 (6th Cir. 2012). If there\nis a dominant theme to the Court’s cases in this area, it is to end otherness, not to create new\nothers.\n\n          All of this explains why the Court’s decisions in City of Cleburne and Romer do not turn\non reading the minds of city voters in one case or of statewide initiative supporters in the other.\nThey turn on asking whether anything but prejudice to the affected class could explain the law.\nSee City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 450; Romer, 517 U.S. at 635. No such explanations existed in\nthose cases.     Plenty exist here, as shown above and as recognized by many others.             See\nLawrence, 539 U.S. at 585 (O’Connor, J., concurring in the judgment) (“Unlike the moral\ndisapproval of same-sex relations[,] . . . other reasons exist to promote the institution of marriage\nbeyond mere moral disapproval of an excluded group.”); Bishop, 760 F.3d at 1104–09 (Holmes,\nJ., concurring) (same); Citizens for Equal Prot. v. Bruning, 455 F.3d 859, 868 (8th Cir. 2006)\n(enactment not “‘inexplicable by anything but animus’ towards same-sex couples”); Conaway v.\nDeane, 932 A.2d 571, 635 (Md. 2007) (no reason to “infer antipathy”); Hernandez v. Robles,\n855 N.E.2d 1, 8 (N.Y. 2006) (those who favor the traditional definition are not “irrational,\nignorant or bigoted”); Andersen v. King Cnty., 138 P.3d 963, 981 (Wash. 2006) (en banc) (“the\nonly reason” for the law was not “anti-gay sentiment”).\n\n          One other point. Even if we agreed with the claimants that the nature of these state\nconstitutional amendments, and the debates surrounding them, required their invalidation on\nanimus grounds, that would not give them what they request in their complaints: the right to\nsame-sex marriage. All that the invalidation of the amendments would do is return state law to\nwhere it had always been, a status quo that in all four States included state statutory and common\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 28\n\nlaw definitions of marriage applicable to one man and one woman—definitions that no one\nclaims were motivated by ill will. The elimination of the state constitutional provisions, it is\ntrue, would allow individuals to challenge the four States’ other marital laws on state\nconstitutional grounds. No one filed such a challenge here, however.\n\n                                                 E.\n\n       Fundamental right to marry. Under the Due Process Clause, courts apply more muscular\nreview—“strict,” “rigorous,” usually unforgiving, scrutiny—to laws that impair “fundamental”\nrights. In considering the claimants’ arguments that they have a fundamental right to marry each\nother, we must keep in mind that something can be fundamentally important without being a\nfundamental right under the Constitution. Otherwise, state regulations of many deeply important\nsubjects—from education to healthcare to living conditions to decisions about when to die—\nwould be subject to unforgiving review. They are not. See San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\nRodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 35 (1973) (public education); Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 469 (1977)\n(healthcare); Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 73–74 (1972) (housing); Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at\n728 (right to die).    Instead, the question is whether our nation has treated the right as\nfundamental and therefore worthy of protection under substantive due process. More precisely,\nthe test is whether the right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and “implicit\nin the concept of ordered liberty,” such that “neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were\nsacrificed.” Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721 (internal citations omitted). That requirement often is\nmet by placing the right in the Constitution, most obviously in (most of) the guarantees in the\nBill of Rights. See id. at 720. But the right to marry in general, and the right to gay marriage in\nparticular, nowhere appear in the Constitution. That route for recognizing a fundamental right to\nsame-sex marriage does not exist.\n\n       That leaves the other option—that, even though a proposed right to same-sex marriage\ndoes not appear in the Constitution, it turns on bedrock assumptions about liberty. This too does\nnot work. The first state high court to redefine marriage to include gay couples did not do so\nuntil 2003 in Goodridge.\n\n       Matters do not change because Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), held that\n“marriage” amounts to a fundamental right. When the Court decided Loving, “marriage between\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 29\n\na man and a woman no doubt [was] thought of . . . as essential to the very definition of that\nterm.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2689. In referring to “marriage” rather than “opposite-sex\nmarriage,” Loving confirmed only that “opposite-sex marriage” would have been considered\nredundant, not that marriage included same-sex couples. Loving did not change the definition.\nThat is why the Court said marriage is “fundamental to our very existence and survival,”\n388 U.S. at 12, a reference to the procreative definition of marriage. Had a gay African-\nAmerican male and a gay Caucasian male been denied a marriage license in Virginia in 1968,\nwould the Supreme Court have held that Virginia had violated the Fourteenth Amendment? No\none to our knowledge thinks so, and no Justice to our knowledge has ever said so. The denial of\nthe license would have turned not on the races of the applicants but on a request to change the\ndefinition of marriage. Had Loving meant something more when it pronounced marriage a\nfundamental right, how could the Court hold in Baker five years later that gay marriage does not\neven raise a substantial federal question?        Loving addressed, and rightly corrected, an\nunconstitutional eligibility requirement for marriage; it did not create a new definition of\nmarriage.\n\n       A similar problem confronts the claimants’ reliance on other decisions treating marriage\nas a fundamental right, whether in the context of a statute denying marriage licenses to fathers\nwho could not pay child support, Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 383 (1978), or a regulation\nrestricting prisoners’ ability to obtain marriage licenses, Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 94–95\n(1987). It strains credulity to believe that a year after each decision a gay indigent father could\nhave required the State to grant him a marriage license for his partnership or that a gay prisoner\ncould have required the State to permit him to marry a gay partner. When Loving and its\nprogeny used the word marriage, they did not redefine the term but accepted its traditional\nmeaning.\n\n       No doubt, many people, many States, even some dictionaries, now define marriage in a\nway that is untethered to biology. But that does not transform the fundamental-rights decision of\nLoving under the old definition into a constitutional right under the new definition. The question\nis whether the old reasoning applies to the new setting, not whether we can shoehorn new\nmeanings into old words. Else, evolving-norm lexicographers would have a greater say over the\nmeaning of the Constitution than judges.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 30\n\n       The upshot of fundamental-rights status, keep in mind, is strict-scrutiny status, subjecting\nall state eligibility rules for marriage to rigorous, usually unforgiving, review. That makes little\nsense with respect to the trials and errors societies historically have undertaken (and presumably\nwill continue to undertake) in determining who may enter and leave a marriage. Start with the\nduration of a marriage. For some, marriage is a commitment for life and beyond. For others, it\nis a commitment for life. For still others, it is neither. In 1969, California enacted the first pure\nno-fault divorce statute. See Family Law Act of 1969, 1969 Cal. Stat. 3312. A dramatic\nexpansion of similar laws followed. See Lynn D. Wardle, No-Fault Divorce and the Divorce\nConundrum, 1991 BYU L. Rev. 79, 90. The Court has never subjected these policy fits and\nstarts about who may leave a marriage to strict scrutiny.\n\n       Consider also the number of people eligible to marry. As late as the eighteenth century,\n“[t]he predominance of monogamy was by no means a foregone conclusion,” and “[m]ost of the\npeoples and cultures around the globe” had adopted a different system. Nancy F. Cott, Public\nVows: A History of Marriage and the Nation 9 (2000). Over time, American officials wove\nmonogamy into marriage’s fabric. Beginning in the nineteenth century, the federal government\n“encouraged or forced” Native Americans to adopt the policy, and in 1878 the Supreme Court\nupheld a federal antibigamy law. Id. at 26; see Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145 (1878).\nThe Court has never taken this topic under its wing. And if it did, how would the constitutional,\nas opposed to policy, arguments in favor of same-sex marriage not apply to plural marriages?\n\n       Consider finally the nature of the individuals eligible to marry. The age of consent has\nnot remained constant, for example. Under Roman law, men could marry at fourteen, women at\ntwelve. The American colonies imported that rule from England and kept it until the mid-1800s,\nwhen the people began advocating for a higher minimum age. Today, all but two States set the\nnumber at eighteen. See Vivian E. Hamilton, The Age of Marital Capacity: Reconsidering Civil\nRecognition of Adolescent Marriage, 92 B.U. L. Rev. 1817, 1824–32 (2012). The same goes for\nthe social acceptability of marriage between cousins, a union deemed “desirable in many parts of\nthe world”; indeed, around “10 percent of marriages worldwide are between people who are\nsecond cousins or closer.” Sarah Kershaw, Living Together: Shaking Off the Shame, N.Y. Times\n(Nov. 25, 2009), http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/garden/26cousins.html.              Even in the\nUnited States, cousin marriage was not prohibited until the mid-nineteenth century, when\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 31\n\nKansas—followed by seven other States—enacted the first ban. See Diane B. Paul & Hamish G.\nSpencer, “It’s Ok, We’re Not Cousins by Blood”: The Cousin Marriage Controversy in\nHistorical Perspective, 6 PLoS Biology 2627, 2627 (2008). The States, however, remain split:\nhalf of them still permit the practice. Ghassemi v. Ghassemi, 998 So. 2d 731, 749 (La. Ct. App.\n2008). Strict scrutiny? Neither Loving nor any other Supreme Court decision says so.\n\n                                                F.\n\n        Discrete and insular class without political power. A separate line of cases, this one\nunder the Equal Protection Clause, calls for heightened review of laws that target groups whom\nlegislators have singled out for unequal treatment in the past. This argument faces an initial\nimpediment.        Our precedents say that rational basis review applies to sexual-orientation\nclassifications.    See Davis v. Prison Health Servs., 679 F.3d 433, 438 (6th Cir. 2012);\nScarbrough v. Morgan Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 470 F.3d 250, 260–61 (6th Cir. 2006); Stemler v. City\nof Florence, 126 F.3d 856, 873–74 (6th Cir. 1997).\n\n        There is another impediment.       The Supreme Court has never held that legislative\nclassifications based on sexual orientation receive heightened review and indeed has not\nrecognized a new suspect class in more than four decades. There are ample reasons for staying\nthe course.    Courts consider four rough factors in deciding whether to treat a legislative\nclassification as suspect and presumptively unconstitutional: whether the group has been\nhistorically victimized by governmental discrimination; whether it has a defining characteristic\nthat legitimately bears on the classification; whether it exhibits unchanging characteristics that\ndefine it as a discrete group; and whether it is politically powerless. See Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at\n28.\n\n        We cannot deny the lamentable reality that gay individuals have experienced prejudice in\nthis country, sometimes at the hands of public officials, sometimes at the hands of fellow\ncitizens. Stonewall, Anita Bryant’s uninvited answer to the question “Who are we to judge?”,\nunequal enforcement of antisodomy laws between gay and straight partners, Matthew Shepard,\nand the language of insult directed at gays and others make it hard for anyone to deny the point.\nBut we also cannot deny that the institution of marriage arose independently of this record of\ndiscrimination. The traditional definition of marriage goes back thousands of years and spans\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 32\n\nalmost every society in history. By contrast, “American laws targeting same-sex couples did not\ndevelop until the last third of the 20th century.” Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 570. This order of events\nprevents us from inferring from history that prejudice against gays led to the traditional\ndefinition of marriage in the same way that we can infer from history that prejudice against\nAfrican Americans led to laws against miscegenation.            The usual leap from history of\ndiscrimination to intensification of judicial review does not work.\n\n       Windsor says nothing to the contrary. In arguing otherwise, plaintiffs mistake Windsor’s\navoidance of one federalism question for avoidance of federalism altogether. Here is the key\npassage:\n\n       Despite these considerations, it is unnecessary to decide whether this federal\n       intrusion on state power is a violation of the Constitution because it disrupts the\n       federal balance. The State’s power in defining the marital relation is of central\n       relevance in this case quite apart from principles of federalism. Here the State’s\n       decision to give this class of persons the right to marry conferred upon them a\n       dignity and status of immense import. When the State used its historic and\n       essential authority to define the marital relation in this way, its role and its power\n       in making the decision enhanced the recognition, dignity, and protection of the\n       class in their own community. DOMA, because of its reach and extent, departs\n       from this history and tradition of reliance on state law to define marriage.\n       “‘[D]iscriminations of an unusual character especially suggest careful\n       consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to the constitutional\n       provision.’”\n\nWindsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2692 (quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at 633). Plaintiffs read these words (and\nothers that follow) as an endorsement of heightened review in today’s case, pointing to the first\ntwo sentences as proof that individual dignity, not federalism, animates Windsor’s holding.\n\n       Yet federalism permeates both parts of this passage and both parts of the opinion.\nWindsor begins by expressing doubts about whether Congress has the delegated power to enact a\nstatute like DOMA at all. But instead of resolving the case on the far-reaching enumerated-\npower ground, it resolves the case on the narrower Romer ground—that anomalous exercises of\npower targeting a single group raise suspicion that bigotry rather than legitimate policy is afoot.\nWhy was DOMA anomalous? Only federalism can supply the answer. The national statute\ntrespassed upon New York’s time-respected authority to define the marital relation, including by\n“enhanc[ing] the recognition, dignity, and protection” of gay and lesbian couples. Id. Today’s\ncase involves no such “divest[ing]”/“depriv[ing]”/“undermin[ing]” of a marriage status granted\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                   Page 33\n\nthrough a State’s authority over domestic relations within its borders and thus provides no basis\nfor inferring that the purpose of the state law was to “impose a disadvantage”/“a separate\nstatus”/“a stigma” on gay couples. Id. at 2692–95. When the Framers “split the atom of\nsovereignty,” U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779, 838 (Kennedy, J., concurring),\nthey did so to enhance liberty, not to allow the National Government to divest liberty protections\ngranted by the States in the exercise of their historic and in this instance nearly exclusive power.\nWhat we have here is something entirely different. It is the States doing exactly what every State\nhas been doing for hundreds of years: defining marriage as they see it. The only thing that has\nchanged is the willingness of many States over the last eleven years to expand the definition of\nmarriage to encompass gay couples.\n\n       Any other reading of Windsor would require us to subtract key passages from the opinion\nand add an inverted holding. The Court noted that New York “without doubt” had the power\nunder its traditional authority over marriage to extend the definition of marriage to include gay\ncouples and that Congress had no power to enact “unusual” legislation that interfered with the\nStates’ long-held authority to define marriage. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2692–93. A decision\npremised on heightened scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment that redefined marriage\nnationally to include same-sex couples not only would divest the States of their traditional\nauthority over this issue, but it also would authorize Congress to do something no one would\nhave thought possible a few years ago—to use its Section 5 enforcement powers to add new\ndefinitions and extensions of marriage rights in the years ahead. That would leave the States\nwith little authority to resolve ever-changing debates about how to define marriage (and the\nbenefits and burdens that come with it) outside the beck and call of Congress and the Court.\nHow odd that one branch of the National Government (Congress) would be reprimanded for\nentering the fray in 2013 and two branches of the same Government (the Court and Congress)\nwould take control of the issue a short time later.\n\n       Nor, as the most modest powers of observation attest, is this a setting in which “political\npowerlessness” requires “extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.”\nRodriguez, 411 U.S. at 28. This is not a setting in which dysfunction mars the political process.\nSee Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964); Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962). It is not a\nsetting in which the recalcitrance of Jim Crow demands judicial, rather than we-can’t-wait-\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                   Page 34\n\nforever legislative, answers. See Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (1954). It is not a setting\nin which time shows that even a potentially powerful group cannot make headway on issues of\nequality. See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973). It is not a setting where a national\ncrisis—the Depression—seemingly demanded constitutional innovation. See W. Coast Hotel Co.\nv. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 (1937). And it is not a setting, most pertinently, in which the local,\nstate, and federal governments historically disenfranchised the suspect class, as they did with\nAfrican Americans and women. See United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152\nn.4 (1938).\n\n       Instead, from the claimants’ perspective, we have an eleven-year record marked by nearly\nas many successes as defeats and a widely held assumption that the future holds more promise\nthan the past—if the federal courts will allow that future to take hold. Throughout that time,\nother advances for the claimants’ cause are manifest. Nationally, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” is\ngone. Locally, the Cincinnati charter amendment that prevented gay individuals from obtaining\ncertain preferences from the city, upheld by our court in 1997, Equality Found. of Greater\nCincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati, 128 F.3d 289 (6th Cir. 1997), is no more. The Fourteenth\nAmendment does not insulate influential, indeed eminently successful, interest groups from a\ndefining attribute of all democratic initiatives—some succeed, some fail—particularly when\nsucceeding more and failing less are in the offing.\n\n       Why, it is worth asking, the sudden change in public opinion? If there is one thing that\nseems to challenge hearts and minds, even souls, on this issue, it is the transition from the\nabstract to the concrete. If twenty-five percent of the population knew someone who was openly\ngay in 1985, and seventy-five percent knew the same in 2000, Klarman, supra, at 197, it is fair to\nwonder how few individuals still have not been forced to think about the matter through the lens\nof a gay friend or family member. That would be a discrete and insular minority.\n\n       The States’ undoubted power over marriage provides an independent basis for reviewing\nthe laws before us with deference rather than with skepticism. An analogy shows why. When a\nstate law targets noncitizens—a group marked by its lack of political power and its history of\nenduring discrimination—it must in general meet the most demanding of constitutional tests in\norder to survive a skirmish with a court. But when a federal law targets noncitizens, a mere\nrational basis will save it from invalidation. This disparity arises because of the Nation’s\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 35\n\nauthority (and the States’ corresponding lack of authority) over international affairs. Mathews v.\nDiaz, 426 U.S. 67, 84–85 (1976). If federal preeminence in foreign relations requires lenient\nreview of federal immigration classifications, why doesn’t state preeminence in domestic\nrelations call for equally lenient review of state marriage definitions?\n\n                                                 G.\n\n       Evolving meaning. If all else fails, the plaintiffs invite us to consider that “[a] core\nstrength of the American legal system . . . is its capacity to evolve” in response to new ways of\nthinking about old policies. DeBoer Appellees’ Br. at 57–58. But even if we accept this\ninvitation and put aside the past—original meaning, tradition, time-respected doctrine—that does\nnot take the plaintiffs where they wish to go. We could, to be sure, look at this case alongside\nevolving moral and policy considerations. The Supreme Court has done so before. Lawrence,\n539 U.S. at 573. It may do so again. “A prime part of the history of our Constitution . . . is the\nstory of the extension of constitutional rights . . . to people once ignored or excluded.” United\nStates v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 557 (1996). Why not do so here?\n\n       Even on this theory, the marriage laws do not violate the Constitution. A principled\njurisprudence of constitutional evolution turns on evolution in society’s values, not evolution in\njudges’ values. Freed of federal-court intervention, thirty-one States would continue to define\nmarriage the old-fashioned way. Lawrence, by contrast, dealt with a situation in which just\nthirteen States continued to prohibit sodomy, and even then most of those laws had fallen into\ndesuetude, rarely being enforced at all. On this record, what right do we have to say that societal\nvalues, as opposed to judicial values, have evolved toward agreement in favor of same-sex\nmarriage?\n\n       The theory of the living constitution rests on the premise that every generation has the\nright to govern itself. If that premise prevents judges from insisting on principles that society has\nmoved past, so too should it prevent judges from anticipating principles that society has yet to\nembrace. It follows that States must enjoy some latitude in matters of timing, for reasonable\npeople can disagree about just when public norms have evolved enough to require a democratic\nresponse. Today’s case captures the point. Not long ago American society took for granted the\nrough correlation between marriage and creation of new life, a vision under which limiting\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 36\n\nmarriage to opposite-sex couples seemed natural. Not long from now, if current trends continue,\nAmerican society may define marriage in terms of affirming mutual love, a vision under which\nthe failure to add loving gay couples seems unfair. Today’s society has begun to move past the\nfirst picture of marriage, but it has not yet developed a consensus on the second.\n\n       If, before a new consensus has emerged on a social issue, federal judges may decide\nwhen the time is ripe to recognize a new constitutional right, surely the people should receive\nsome deference in deciding when the time is ripe to move from one picture of marriage to\nanother. So far, not a single United States Supreme Court Justice in American history has\nwritten an opinion maintaining that the traditional definition of marriage violates the Fourteenth\nAmendment.     No one would accuse the Supreme Court of acting irrationally in failing to\nrecognize a right to same-sex marriage in 2013. Likewise, we should hesitate to accuse the\nStates of acting irrationally in failing to recognize the right in 2004 or 2006 or for that matter\ntoday. Federal judges engaged in the inherent pacing that comes with living constitutionalism\nshould appreciate the inherent pacing that comes with democratic majorities deciding within\nreasonable bounds when and whether to embrace an evolving, as opposed to settled, societal\nnorm. The one form of pacing is akin to the other, making it anomalous for the Court to hold\nthat the States act unconstitutionally when making reasonable pacing decisions of their own.\n\n       From time to time, the Supreme Court has looked beyond our borders in deciding when\nto expand the meaning of constitutional guarantees. Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 576. Yet foreign\npractice only reinforces the impropriety of tinkering with the democratic process in this setting.\nThe great majority of countries across the world—including such progressive democracies as\nAustralia and Finland—still adhere to the traditional definition of marriage. Even more telling,\nthe European Court of Human Rights ruled only a few years ago that European human rights\nlaws do not guarantee a right to same-sex marriage. Schalk & Kopf v. Austria, 2010-IV Eur. Ct.\nH.R. 409. “The area in question,” it explained in words that work just as well on this side of the\nAtlantic, remains “one of evolving rights with no established consensus,” which means that\nStates must “enjoy [discretion] in the timing of the introduction of legislative changes.” Id. at\n438.   It reiterated this conclusion as recently as this July, declaring that “the margin of\nappreciation to be afforded” to States “must still be a wide one.” Hämäläinen v. Finland, No.\n37359/09, HUDOC, at *19 (Eur. Ct. H.R. July 16, 2014). Our Supreme Court relied on the\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 37\n\nEuropean Court’s gay-rights decisions in Lawrence. 539 U.S. at 576. What neutral principle of\nconstitutional interpretation allows us to ignore the European Court’s same-sex marriage\ndecisions when deciding this case? If the point is relevant in the one setting, it is relevant in the\nother, especially in a case designed to treat like matters alike.\n\n       Other practical considerations also do not favor the creation of a new constitutional right\nhere. While these cases present a denial of access to many benefits, what is “[o]f greater\nimportance” to the claimants, as they see it, “is the loss of . . . dignity and respect” occasioned by\nthese laws. Love Appellees’ Br. at 5. No doubt there is much to be said for “dignity and\nrespect” in the eyes of the Constitution and its interpreters. But any loss of dignity and respect\non this issue did not come from the Constitution.            It came from the neighborhoods and\ncommunities in which gay and lesbian couples live, and in which it is worth trying to correct the\nproblem in the first instance—and in that way “to allow the formation of consensus respecting\nthe way the members” of a State “treat each other in their daily contact and constant interaction\nwith each other.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2692.\n\n       For all of the power that comes with the authority to interpret the United States\nConstitution, the federal courts have no long-lasting capacity to change what people think and\nbelieve about new social questions. If the plaintiffs are convinced that litigation is the best way\nto resolve today’s debate and to change heads and hearts in the process, who are we to say?\nPerhaps that is not the only point, however. Yes, we cannot deny thinking the plaintiffs deserve\nbetter—earned victories through initiatives and legislation and the greater acceptance that comes\nwith them. But maybe the American people too deserve better—not just in the sense of having a\nsay through representatives in the legislature rather than through representatives in the courts, but\nalso in the sense of having to come face to face with the issue.               Rights need not be\ncountermajoritarian to count. See, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88352, 78 Stat.\n241. Isn’t the goal to create a culture in which a majority of citizens dignify and respect the\nrights of minority groups through majoritarian laws rather than through decisions issued by a\nmajority of Supreme Court Justices? It is dangerous and demeaning to the citizenry to assume\nthat we, and only we, can fairly understand the arguments for and against gay marriage.\n\n       Last, but not least, federal courts never expand constitutional guarantees in a vacuum.\nWhat one group wants on one issue from the courts today, another group will want on another\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 38\n\nissue tomorrow. The more the Court innovates under the Constitution, the more plausible it is\nfor the Court to do still more—and the more plausible it is for other advocates on behalf of other\nissues to ask the Court to innovate still more.         And while the expansion of liberal and\nconservative constitutional rights will solve, or at least sidestep, the amendment-difficulty\nproblem that confronts many individuals and interest groups, it will exacerbate the judge-\nconfirmation problem. Faith in democracy with respect to issues that the Constitution has not\ncommitted to the courts reinforces a different, more sustainable norm.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       Does the Constitution prohibit a State from denying recognition to same-sex marriages\nconducted in other States? That is the question presented in the two Ohio cases (Obergefell and\nHenry), one of the Kentucky cases (Bourke), and the Tennessee case (Tanco). Our answer to the\nfirst question goes a long way toward answering this one. If it is constitutional for a State to\ndefine marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman, it is also constitutional for the\nState to stand by that definition with respect to couples married in other States or countries.\n\n       The Constitution in general does not delineate when a State must apply its own laws and\nwhen it must apply the laws of another State. Neither any federal statute nor federal common\nlaw fills the gap. Throughout our history, each State has decided for itself how to resolve clashes\nbetween its laws and laws of other sovereigns—giving rise to the field of conflict of laws. The\nStates enjoy wide latitude in fashioning choice-of-law rules. Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U.S.\n717, 727–29 (1988); Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hague, 449 U.S. 302, 307–08 (1981).\n\n       The plaintiffs in these cases do not claim that refusal to recognize out-of-state gay and\nlesbian marriages violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the principal constitutional limit on\nstate choice-of-law rules. Wisely so. The Clause “does not require a State to apply another\nState’s law in violation of its own legitimate public policy.” Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 422\n(1979). If defining marriage as an opposite-sex relationship amounts to a legitimate public\npolicy—and we have just explained that it does—the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not\nprevent a State from applying that policy to couples who move from one State to another.\n\n       The plaintiffs instead argue that failure to recognize gay marriages celebrated in other\nStates violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. But we do not think that the\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 39\n\ninvocation of these different clauses justifies a different result. As shown, compliance with the\nDue Process and Equal Protection Clauses in this setting requires only a rational relationship\nbetween the legislation and a legitimate public purpose. And a State does not behave irrationally\nby insisting upon its own definition of marriage rather than deferring to the definition adopted by\nanother State. Preservation of a State’s authority to recognize, or to opt not to recognize, an out-\nof-state marriage preserves a State’s sovereign interest in deciding for itself how to define the\nmarital relationship.   It also discourages evasion of the State’s marriage laws by allowing\nindividuals to go to another State, marry there, then return home. Were it irrational for a State to\nadhere to its own policy, what would be the point of the Supreme Court’s repeated holdings that\nthe Full Faith and Credit Clause “does not require a State to apply another State’s law in\nviolation of its own public policy”? Id.\n\n       Far from undermining these points, Windsor reinforces them. The case observes that\n“[t]he definition of marriage is the foundation of the State’s broader authority to regulate the\nsubject of domestic relations with respect to the protection of offspring, property interests, and\nthe enforcement of marital responsibilities.” 133 S. Ct. at 2691 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). How could it be irrational for a State to decide that the foundation of its domestic-\nrelations law will be its definition of marriage, not somebody else’s? Windsor adds that “[e]ach\nstate as a sovereign has a rightful and legitimate concern in the marital status of persons\ndomiciled within its borders.” Id. How could it be irrational for a State to apply its definition of\nmarriage to a couple in whose marital status the State as a sovereign has a rightful and legitimate\nconcern?\n\n       Nor does the policy of nonrecognition trigger Windsor’s (or Romer’s) principle that\nunprecedented exercises of power call for judicial skepticism. States have always decided for\nthemselves when to yield to laws of other States. Exercising this power, States often have\nrefused to enforce all sorts of out-of-state rules on the grounds that they contradict important\nlocal policies. See Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws § 612; Restatement (Second) of\nConflict of Laws § 90. Even more telling, States in many instances have refused to recognize\nmarriages performed in other States on the grounds that these marriages depart from cardinal\nprinciples of the State’s domestic-relations laws. See Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                   Page 40\n\n§ 134; Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 283. The laws challenged here involve\nroutine rather than anomalous uses of state power.\n\n       What of the reality that Ohio recognizes some heterosexual marriages solemnized in\nother States even if those marriages could not be performed in Ohio? See, e.g., Mazzolini v.\nMazzolini, 155 N.E.2d 206, 208 (Ohio 1958). The only reason Ohio could have for banning\nrecognition of same-sex marriages performed elsewhere and not prohibiting heterosexual\nmarriages performed elsewhere, the Ohio plaintiffs claim, is animus or “discrimination[] of an\nunusual character.” Obergefell Appellees’ Br. at 18 (quoting Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2692).\n\n       But, in making this argument, the plaintiffs misapprehend Ohio law, wrongly assuming\nthat Ohio would recognize as valid any heterosexual marriage that was valid in the State that\nsanctioned it. That is not the case. Ohio law recognizes some out-of-state marriages that could\nnot be performed in Ohio, but not all such marriages. See, e.g., Mazzolini, 155 N.E.2d at 208\n(marriage of first cousins); Hardin v. Davis, 16 Ohio Supp. 19, 20 (Ohio Ct. Com. Pl. 1945)\n(marriage by proxy). In Mazzolini, the most relevant precedent, the Ohio Supreme Court stated\nthat a number of heterosexual marriages—ones that were “incestuous, polygamous, shocking to\ngood morals, unalterably opposed to a well defined public policy, or prohibited”—would not be\nrecognized in the State, even if they were valid in the jurisdiction that performed them.\n155 N.E.2d at 208–09 (noting that first-cousin marriages fell outside this rule because they were\n“not made void by explicit provision” and “not incestuous”). Ohio law declares same-sex\nmarriage contrary to the State’s public policy, placing those marriages within the longstanding\nexception to Ohio’s recognition rule. See Ohio Rev. Code § 3101.01(C).\n\n                                                IV.\n\n       That leaves one more claim, premised on the constitutional right to travel.           In the\nTennessee case (Tanco) and one of the Ohio cases (Henry), the claimants maintain that a State’s\nrefusal to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages illegitimately burdens the right to travel—in\nthe one case by penalizing couples who move into the State by refusing to recognize their\nmarriages, in the other by preventing their child from obtaining a passport because the State\nrefused to provide a birth certificate that included the names of both parents.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 41\n\n        The United States Constitution does not mention a right to travel by name. “Yet the\nconstitutional right to travel from one State to another is firmly embedded in our jurisprudence.”\nSaenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 498 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). It provides three\nguarantees: (1) “the right of a citizen of one State to enter and to leave another State”; (2) “the\nright to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien” when visiting a second\nState; and (3) the right of new permanent residents “to be treated like other citizens of that\nState.” Id. at 500.\n\n        Tennessee’s nonrecognition law does not violate these prohibitions. It does not ban, or\nfor that matter regulate, movement into or out of the State other than in the respect all regulations\ncreate incentives or disincentives to live in one place or another. Most critically, the law does\nnot punish out-of-state new residents in relation to its own born and bred. Nonresidents are\n“treated” just “like other citizens of that State,” id., because the State has not expanded the\ndefinition of marriage to include gay couples in all settings, whether the individuals just arrived\nin Tennessee or descend from Andrew Jackson.\n\n        The same is true for the Ohio law. No regulation of movement or differential treatment\nbetween the newly resident and the longstanding resident occurs. All Ohioans must follow the\nState’s definition of marriage. With respect to the need to obtain an Ohio birth certificate before\nobtaining a passport, they can get one. The certificate just will not include both names of the\ncouple. The “just” of course goes to the heart of the matter. In that respect, however, it is due\nprocess and equal protection, not the right to travel, that govern the issue.\n\n                                                ***\n\n        This case ultimately presents two ways to think about change. One is whether the\nSupreme Court will constitutionalize a new definition of marriage to meet new policy views\nabout the issue. The other is whether the Court will begin to undertake a different form of\nchange—change in the way we as a country optimize the handling of efforts to address requests\nfor new civil liberties.\n\n        If the Court takes the first approach, it may resolve the issue for good and give the\nplaintiffs and many others relief. But we will never know what might have been. If the Court\ntakes the second approach, is it not possible that the traditional arbiters of change—the people—\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 42\n\nwill meet today’s challenge admirably and settle the issue in a productive way? In just eleven\nyears, nineteen States and a conspicuous District, accounting for nearly forty-five percent of the\npopulation, have exercised their sovereign powers to expand a definition of marriage that until\nrecently was universally followed going back to the earliest days of human history. That is a\ndifficult timeline to criticize as unworthy of further debate and voting. When the courts do not\nlet the people resolve new social issues like this one, they perpetuate the idea that the heroes in\nthese change events are judges and lawyers. Better in this instance, we think, to allow change\nthrough the customary political processes, in which the people, gay and straight alike, become\nthe heroes of their own stories by meeting each other not as adversaries in a court system but as\nfellow citizens seeking to resolve a new social issue in a fair-minded way.\n\n       For these reasons, we reverse.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v.

But as an appellate court decision, it\nwholly fails to grapple with the relevant constitutional question in this appeal: whether a state’s\nconstitutional prohibition of same-sex marriage violates equal protection under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Instead, the majority sets up a false premise—that the question before us is “who\nshould decide?”—and leads us through a largely irrelevant discourse on democracy and\nfederalism. In point of fact, the real issue before us concerns what is at stake in these six cases\nfor the individual plaintiffs and their children, and what should be done about it. Because I reject\nthe majority’s resolution of these questions based on its invocation of vox populi and its\nreverence for “proceeding with caution” (otherwise known as the “wait and see” approach), I\ndissent.\n\n       In the main, the majority treats both the issues and the litigants here as mere abstractions.\nInstead of recognizing the plaintiffs as persons, suffering actual harm as a result of being denied\nthe right to marry where they reside or the right to have their valid marriages recognized there,\nmy colleagues view the plaintiffs as social activists who have somehow stumbled into federal\ncourt, inadvisably, when they should be out campaigning to win “the hearts and minds” of\nMichigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee voters to their cause. But these plaintiffs are not\npolitical zealots trying to push reform on their fellow citizens; they are committed same-sex\ncouples, many of them heading up de facto families, who want to achieve equal status—de jure\nstatus, if you will—with their married neighbors, friends, and coworkers, to be accepted as\ncontributing members of their social and religious communities, and to be welcomed as fully\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818               DeBoer v. Snyder                          Page 44\n\nlegitimate parents at their children’s schools. They seek to do this by virtue of exercising a civil\nright that most of us take for granted—the right to marry.1\n\n        Readers who are familiar with the Supreme Court’s recent opinion in United States v.\nWindsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), and its progeny in the circuit courts, particularly the Seventh\nCircuit’s opinion in Baskin v. Bogan, 766 F.3d 648, 654 (7th Cir. 2014) (“Formally these cases\nare about discrimination against the small homosexual minority in the United States. But at a\ndeeper level, . . . they are about the welfare of American children.”), must have said to\nthemselves at various points in the majority opinion, “But what about the children?” I did, and I\ncould not find the answer in the opinion. For although my colleagues in the majority pay lip\nservice to marriage as an institution conceived for the purpose of providing a stable family unit\n“within which children may flourish,” they ignore the destabilizing effect of its absence in the\nhomes of tens of thousands of same-sex parents throughout the four states of the Sixth Circuit.\n\n        Indeed, with the exception of Ohio, the defendants in each of these cases—the\nproponents of their respective “defense of marriage” amendments—spent virtually their entire\noral arguments professing what has come to be known as the “irresponsible procreation” theory:\nthat limiting marriage and its benefits to opposite-sex couples is rational, even necessary, to\nprovide for “unintended offspring” by channeling their biological procreators into the bonds of\nmatrimony. When we asked counsel why that goal required the simultaneous exclusion of same-\nsex couples from marrying, we were told that permitting same-sex marriage might denigrate the\ninstitution of marriage in the eyes of opposite-sex couples who conceive out of wedlock, causing\nsubsequent abandonment of the unintended offspring by one or both biological parents. We also\nwere informed that because same-sex couples cannot themselves produce wanted or unwanted\noffspring, and because they must therefore look to non-biological means of parenting that require\nplanning and expense, stability in a family unit headed by same-sex parents is assured without\nthe benefit of formal matrimony. But, as the court in Baskin pointed out, many “abandoned\nchildren [born out of wedlock to biological parents] are adopted by homosexual couples, and\n\n        1\n          See, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967) (“Marriage is one of the ‘basic civil rights of man,’\nfundamental to our very existence and survival.”) (quoting Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942)). The\nSupreme Court has described the right to marry as “of fundamental importance for all individuals” and as “part of\nthe fundamental ‘right of privacy’ implicit in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.” Zablocki v.\nRedhail, 434 U.S. 374, 384 (1978).\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v.

How ironic that irresponsible, unmarried, opposite-sex couples in the Sixth\nCircuit who produce unwanted offspring must be “channeled” into marriage and thus rewarded\nwith its many psychological and financial benefits, while same-sex couples who become model\nparents are punished for their responsible behavior by being denied the right to marry. As an\nobviously exasperated Judge Posner responded after puzzling over this same paradox in Baskin,\n“Go figure.” Id. at 662.\n\n       In addressing the “irresponsible procreation” argument that has been referenced by\nvirtually every state defendant in litigation similar to this case, the Baskin court noted that\nestimates put the number of American children being raised by same-sex parents at over\n200,000. Id. at 663. “Unintentional offspring are the children most likely to be put up for\nadoption,” id. at 662, and because statistics show that same-sex couples are many times more\nlikely to adopt than opposite-sex couples, “same-sex marriage improves the prospects of\nunintended children by increasing the number and resources of prospective adopters.” Id. at 663.\nMoreover, “[i]f marriage is better for children who are being brought up by their biological\nparents, it must be better for children who are being brought up by their adoptive parents.” Id. at\n664.\n\n       The concern for the welfare of children that echoes throughout the Baskin opinion can be\ntraced in part to the earlier opinion in Windsor, in which the Supreme Court struck down, as\nunconstitutional on equal-protection grounds, section 3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act\n(DOMA), which defined the term “marriage” for federal purposes as “mean[ing] only a legal\nunion between one man and one woman as husband and wife,” and the term “spouse” as\n“refer[ring] only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.” Id. at 2683 (citing\n1 U.S.C. § 7). Although DOMA did not affect the prerogative of the states to regulate marriage\nwithin their respective jurisdictions, it did deprive same-sex couples whose marriages were\nconsidered valid under state law of myriad federal benefits. As Justice Kennedy, writing for the\nmajority, pointed out:\n\n       DOMA’s principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and\n       make them unequal. The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other\n       reasons like governmental efficiency . . . . The differentiation demeans the [same-\n       sex] couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects, see\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 46\n\n       Lawrence [v. Texas], 539 U.S. 558 [(2003)], and whose relationship the State has\n       sought to dignify. And it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being\n       raised by same-sex couples. The law in question makes it even more difficult for\n       the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its\n       concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.\n\nId. at 2694.\n\n       Looking more closely at the situation of just one of the same-sex couples from the six\ncases before us brings Justice Kennedy’s words on paper to life. Two of the Michigan plaintiffs,\nApril DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, are unmarried, same-sex partners who have lived as a couple for\neight years in a home they own together. They are both trained and employed as nurses, DeBoer\nin a hospital neonatal department and Rowse in an emergency department at another hospital.\nTogether they are rearing three children but, due to existing provisions in Michigan’s adoption\nlaws, DeBoer and Rowse are prohibited from adopting the children as joint parents because they\nare unmarried. Instead, Rowse alone adopted two children, who are identified in the record as N\nand J. DeBoer adopted the third child, who is identified as R.\n\n       All three children had difficult starts in life, and two of them are now characterized as\n“special needs” children. N was born on January 25, 2009, to a biological mother who was\nhomeless, had psychological impairments, was unable to care for N, and subsequently\nsurrendered her legal rights to N. The plaintiffs volunteered to care for the boy and brought him\ninto their home following his birth. In November 2009, Rowse completed the necessary steps to\nadopt N legally.\n\n       Rowse also legally adopted J after the boy’s foster care agency asked Rowse and DeBoer\ninitially to serve as foster parents and legal guardians for him, despite the uphill climb the baby\nfaced. According to the plaintiffs’ amended complaint:\n\n       J was born on November 9, 2009, at Hutzel Hospital, premature at 25 weeks, to a\n       drug addicted prostitute. Upon birth, he weighed 1 pound, 9 ounces and tested\n       positive for marijuana, cocaine, opiates and methadone. His birth mother\n       abandoned him immediately after delivery. J remained in the hospital in the\n       NICU for four months with myriad different health complications, and was not\n       expected to live. If he survived, he was not expected to be able to walk, speak or\n       function on a normal level in any capacity. . . . With Rowse and DeBoer’s\n       constant care and medical attention, many of J’s physical conditions have\n       resolved.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 47\n\n       The third adopted child, R, was born on February 1, 2010, to a 19-year-old girl who\nreceived no prenatal care and who gave birth at her mother’s home before bringing the infant to\nthe hospital where plaintiff DeBoer worked. R continues to experience issues related to her lack\nof prenatal care, including delayed gross motor skills. She is in a physical-therapy program to\naddress these problems.\n\n       Both DeBoer and Rowse share in the responsibilities of raising the two four-year-olds\nand the five-year-old.    The plaintiffs even have gone so far as to “coordinate their work\nschedules so that at least one parent is generally home with the children” to attend to their\nmedical needs and perform other parental duties. Given the close-knit, loving environment\nshared by the plaintiffs and the children, DeBoer wishes to adopt N and J legally as a second\nparent, and Rowse wishes to adopt R legally as her second parent.\n\n       Although Michigan statutes allow married couples and single persons to adopt, those\nlaws preclude unmarried couples from adopting each other’s children. As a result, DeBoer and\nRowse filed suit in federal district court challenging the Michigan adoption statute, Michigan\nCompiled Laws § 710.24, on federal equal-protection grounds.           They later amended their\ncomplaint to include a challenge to the so-called Michigan Marriage Amendment, see Mich.\nConst. art. I, § 25, added to the Michigan state constitution in 2004, after the district court\nsuggested that the plaintiffs’ “injury was not traceable to the defendants’ enforcement of section\n[710.24]” but, rather, flowed from the fact that the plaintiffs “were not married, and any legal\nform of same-sex union is prohibited” in Michigan. The case went to trial on the narrow legal\nissue of whether the amendment could survive rational basis review, i.e., whether it proscribes\nconduct in a manner that is rationally related to any conceivable legitimate governmental\npurpose.\n\n       The bench trial lasted for eight days and consisted of testimony from sociologists,\neconomists, law professors, a psychologist, a historian, a demographer, and a county clerk.\nIncluded in the plaintiffs’ presentation of evidence were statistics regarding the number of\nchildren in foster care or awaiting adoption, as well as testimony regarding the difficulties facing\nsame-sex partners attempting to retain parental influence over children adopted in Michigan.\nGary Gates, a demographer, and Vivek Sankaran, the director of both the Child Advocacy Law\nClinic and the Child Welfare Appellate Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School,\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 48\n\ntogether offered testimony painting a grim picture of the plight of foster children and orphans in\nthe state of Michigan. For example, Sankaran noted that just under 14,000 foster children reside\nin Michigan, with approximately 3,500 of those being legal orphans. Nevertheless, same-sex\ncouples in the state are not permitted to adopt such children as a couple. Even though one person\ncan legally adopt a child, should anything happen to that adoptive parent, there is no provision in\nMichigan’s legal framework that would “ensure that the children would necessarily remain with\nthe surviving non-legal parent,” even if that parent went through the arduous, time-consuming,\nexpensive adoption-approval process. Thus, although the State of Michigan would save money\nby moving children from foster care or state care into adoptive families, and although same-sex\ncouples in Michigan are almost three times more likely than opposite-sex couples to be raising\nan adopted child and twice as likely to be fostering a child, there remains a legal disincentive for\nsame-sex couples to adopt children there.\n\n       David Brodzinsky, a developmental and clinical psychologist, for many years on the\nfaculty at Rutgers University, reiterated the testimony that Michigan’s ban on adoptions by\nsame-sex couples increases the potential risks to children awaiting adoptions. The remainder of\nhis testimony was devoted to a systematic, statistic-based debunking of studies intimating that\nchildren raised in gay or lesbian families, ipso facto, are less well-adjusted than children raised\nby heterosexual couples. Brodzinsky conceded that marriage brings societal legitimatization and\nstability to children but noted that he found no statistically significant differences in general\ncharacteristics or in development between children raised in same-sex households and children\nraised in opposite-sex households, and that the psychological well-being, educational\ndevelopment, and peer relationships were the same in children raised in gay, lesbian, or\nheterosexual homes.\n\n       Such findings led Brodzinsky to conclude that the gender of a parent is far less important\nthan the quality of the parenting offered and that family processes and resources are far better\npredictors of child adjustment than the family structure.         He testified that those studies\npresuming to show that children raised in gay and lesbian families exhibited more adjustment\nproblems and decreased educational achievement were seriously flawed, simply because they\nrelied on statistics concerning children who had come from families experiencing a prior\ntraumatic breakup of a failed heterosexual relationship. In fact, when focusing upon children of\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 49\n\nlesbian families created through donor insemination, Brodzinsky found no differences in\ncomparison with children from donor insemination in heterosexual families or in comparison\nwith children conceived naturally in heterosexual families. According to Brodzinsky, such a\nfinding was not surprising given the fact that all such children experienced no family disruption\nin their past. For the same reason, few differences were noted in studies of children adopted at a\nvery early age by same-sex couples and children naturally born into heterosexual families.\n       Nancy Cott, a professor of history at Harvard University, the director of graduate studies\nthere, and the author of Public Vows: A History of Marriage and the Nation, also testified on\nbehalf of the plaintiffs. She explained how the concept of marriage and the roles of the marriage\npartners have changed over time. As summarized by Cott, the wife’s identity is no longer\nsubsumed into that of her husband, interracial marriages are legal now that the antiquated, racist\nconcept of preserving the purity of the white race has fallen into its rightful place of dishonor,\nand traditional gender-assigned roles are no longer standard. Cott also testified that solemnizing\nmarriages between same-sex partners would create tangible benefits for Michigan citizens\nbecause spouses would then be allowed to inherit without taxation and would be able to receive\nretirement, Social Security, and veteran’s benefits upon the death of an eligible spouse.\nMoreover, statistics make clear that heterosexual marriages have not suffered or decreased in\nnumber as a result of states permitting same-sex marriages. In fact, to the contrary, Cott noted\nthat there exists some evidence that many young people now refuse to enter into heterosexual\nmarriages until their gay or lesbian friends can also enjoy the legitimacy of state-backed\nmarriages.\n\n       Michael Rosenfeld, a Stanford University sociologist, testified about studies he had\nundertaken that confirmed the hypothesis that legitimation of same-sex relationships promotes\ntheir stability. Specifically, Rosenfeld’s research established that although same-sex couples\nliving in states without recognition of their commitments to each other did have a higher break-\nup rate than heterosexual married couples, the break-up rates of opposite-sex married couples\nand same-sex couples in recognized civil unions were virtually identical. Similarly, the break-up\nrates of same-sex couples not living in a state-recognized relationship approximated the break-up\nrate of heterosexual couples cohabiting without marriage.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 50\n\n       Rosenfeld also criticized the methodology of studies advanced by the defendants that\ndisagreed with his conclusions. According to Rosenfeld, those critical studies failed to take into\naccount the stability or lack of stability of the various groups examined. For example, he\ntestified that one such study compared children who had experienced no adverse family\ntransitions with children who had lived through many such traumatic family changes. Not\nsurprisingly, children from broken homes with lower-income-earning parents who had less\neducation and lived in urban areas performed more poorly in school than other children.\nAccording to Rosenfeld, arguments to the contrary that failed to control for such differences,\ntaken to their extreme, would lead to the conclusion that only high-income individuals of Asian\ndescent who earned advanced degrees and lived in suburban areas should be allowed to marry.\n\n       To counteract the testimony offered by the plaintiffs’ witnesses, the defendants presented\nas witnesses the authors or co-authors of three studies that disagreed with the conclusions\nreached by the plaintiffs’ experts. All three studies, however, were given little credence by the\ndistrict court because of inherent flaws in the methods used or the intent of the authors. For\nexample, the New Family Structures Study reported by Mark Regnerus, a sociologist at the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, admittedly relied upon interviews of children from gay or lesbian\nfamilies who were products of broken heterosexual unions in order to support a conclusion that\nliving with such gay or lesbian families adversely affected the development of the children.\nRegnerus conceded, moreover, that his own department took the highly unusual step of issuing\nthe following statement on the university website in response to the release of the study:\n\n       [Dr. Regnerus’s opinions] do not reflect the views of the sociology department of\n       the University of Texas at Austin. Nor do they reflect the views of the American\n       Sociological Association which takes the position that the conclusions he draws\n       from his study of gay parenting are fundamentally flawed on conceptual and\n       methodological grounds and that the findings from Dr. Regnerus’[s] work have\n       been cited inappropriately in efforts to diminish the civil rights and legitimacy of\n       LBGTQ partners and their families.\n\nIn fact, the record before the district court reflected clearly that Regnerus’s study had been\nfunded by the Witherspoon Institute, a conservative “think tank” opposed to same-sex marriage,\nin order to vindicate “the traditional understanding of marriage.”\n\n       Douglas Allen, the co-author of another study with Catherine Pakaluk and Joe Price,\ntestified that children raised by same-sex couples graduated from high school at a significantly\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818              DeBoer v. Snyder                          Page 51\n\nlower rate than did children raised by heterosexual married couples. On cross-examination,\nhowever, Allen conceded that “many of those children who . . . were living in same-sex\nhouseholds had previously lived in an opposite sex household where their parents had divorced,\nbroken up, some kind of separation or transition.” Furthermore, Allen provided evidence of the\nbias inherent in his study by admitting that he believed that engaging in homosexual acts “means\neternal separation from God, in other words[,] going to hell.”\n\n        The final study advanced by the defendants was conducted by Loren Marks, a professor\nin human ecology at Louisiana State University, in what was admittedly an effort to counteract\nthe “groupthink” portrayed by perceived “liberal psychologists.” But although Marks criticized\nwhat he perceived to be “a pronounced liberal lean on social issues” by many psychologists, he\nrevealed his own bias by acknowledging that he was a lay clergyman in the Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter Day Saints (LDS) and that the LDS directive “for a couple to be married by\nGod’s authority in God’s house, the holy temple, and then to have children per the teaching that\nGod’s commandment for his children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force.”\n\n        Presented with the admitted biases and methodological shortcomings prevalent in the\nstudies performed by the defendant’s experts, the district court found those witnesses “largely\nunbelievable” and not credible. DeBoer v. Snyder, 973 F. Supp.2d 757, 768 (E.D. Mich. 2014).\nProceeding to a legal analysis of the core issue in the litigation, the district court then concluded\nthat the proscriptions of the marriage amendment are not rationally related to any legitimate state\ninterest. Addressing the defendants’ three asserted rational bases for the amendment,2 the district\ncourt found each such proffered justification without merit.\n\n        Principally, the court determined that the amendment is in no way related to the asserted\nstate interest in ensuring an optimal environment for child-rearing. The testimony adduced at\ntrial clearly refuted the proposition that, all things being equal, same-sex couples are less able to\nprovide for the welfare and development of children. Indeed, marriage, whether between same-\nsex or opposite-sex partners, increases stability within the family unit. By permitting same-sex\n\n\n        2\n          In the district court, the state did not advance an “unintended pregnancy” argument, nor was that claim\nincluded in the state’s brief on appeal, although counsel did mention it during oral argument. In terms of “optimal\nenvironment,” the state emphasized the need for children to have “both a mom and a dad,” because “men and\nwomen are different,” and to have a “biological connection to their parents.”\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 52\n\ncouples to marry, that stability would not be threatened by the death of one of the parents. Even\nmore damning to the defendants’ position, however, is the fact that the State of Michigan allows\nheterosexual couples to marry even if the couple does not wish to have children, even if the\ncouple does not have sufficient resources or education to care for children, even if the parents are\npedophiles or child abusers, and even if the parents are drug addicts.\n\n        Furthermore, the district court found no reason to believe that the amendment furthers the\nasserted state interests in “proceeding with caution” before “altering the traditional definition of\nmarriage” or in “upholding tradition and morality.” As recognized by the district court, there is\nno legitimate justification for delay when constitutional rights are at issue, and even adherence to\nreligious views or tradition cannot serve to strip citizens of their right to the guarantee of equal\nprotection under the law.\n\n        Finally, and relatedly, the district court acknowledged that the regulation of marriage\ntraditionally has been seen as part of a state’s police power but concluded that this fact cannot\nserve as an excuse to ignore the constitutional rights of individual citizens. Were it otherwise,\nthe court observed, the prohibition in Virginia and in many other states against miscegenation\nstill would be in effect today. Because the district court found that “regardless of whoever finds\nfavor in the eyes of the most recent majority, the guarantee of equal protection must prevail,” the\ncourt held the amendment and its implementing statutes “unconstitutional because they violate\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.”\nId. at 775.\n\n        If I were in the majority here, I would have no difficulty in affirming the district court's\nopinion in DeBoer. The record is rich with evidence that, as a pragmatic matter, completely\nrefutes the state’s effort to defend the ban against same-sex marriage that is inherent in the\nmarriage amendment. Moreover, the district court did a masterful job of supporting its legal\nconclusions. Upholding the decision would also control the resolution of the other five cases that\nwere consolidated for purposes of this appeal.\n\n        Is a thorough explication of the legal basis for such a result appropriate? It is, of course.\nIs it necessary? In my judgment, it is not, given the excellent—even eloquent—opinion in\nDeBoer and in the opinions that have come from four other circuits in the last few months that\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818                 DeBoer v. Snyder                            Page 53\n\nhave addressed the same issues involved here: Kitchen v. Herbert, 755 F.3d 1193 (10th Cir.\n2014) (holding Utah statutes and state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage\nunconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment); Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 F.3d 352 (4th Cir.\n2014) (same, Virginia); Baskin v. Bogan, 766 F.3d 648 (7th Cir. 2014) (same, Indiana statute and\nWisconsin state constitutional amendment); and Latta v. Otter, Nos. 14-35420, 14-35421, 12-\n17668, 2014 WL 4977682 (9th Cir. Oct. 7, 2014) (same, Idaho and Nevada statutes and state\nconstitutional amendments).3\n\n         Kitchen was decided primarily on the basis of substantive due process, based on the\nTenth Circuit’s determination that under Supreme Court precedents, the right to marry includes\nthe right to marry the person of one’s choice. The court located the source of that right in\nSupreme Court opinions such as Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190, 205 (1888) (recognizing\nmarriage as “the most important relation in life”); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923)\n(holding that the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment includes the freedom “to marry,\nestablish a home and bring up children”); Loving, 388 U.S. at 12 (“The freedom to marry has\nlong been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of\nhappiness by free men.”); Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 384 (recognizing that “the right to marry is of\nfundamental importance for all individuals”); and Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 95-96 (1987) (in\nthe context of a prison inmate’s right to marry, “[such] marriages are expressions of emotional\nsupport and public commitment[,] . . . elements [that] are important and significant aspects of the\nmarital relationship” even in situations in which procreation is not possible). Kitchen, 755 F.3d\nat 1209-11. The Tenth Circuit also found that the Utah laws violated equal protection, applying\nstrict scrutiny because the classification in question impinged on a fundamental right. In doing\nso, the court rejected the state’s reliance on various justifications offered to establish a\ncompelling state interest in denying marriage to same-sex couples, finding “an insufficient\ncausal connection” between the prohibition on same-sex marriage and the state’s “articulated\ngoals,” which included a purported interest in fostering biological reproduction, encouraging\noptimal childrearing, and maintaining gendered parenting styles. Id. at 1222. The court also\n\n         3\n           On October 6, the Supreme Court denied certiorari and lifted stays in Kitchen, Bostic, and Baskin, putting\ninto effect the district court injunctions entered in each of those three cases. A stay of the mandate in the Idaho case\nin Latta also has been vacated, and the appeal in the Nevada case is not being pursued. As a result, marriage\nlicenses are currently being issued to same-sex couples throughout most—if not all—of the Fourth, Seventh, Ninth,\nand Tenth Circuits.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 54\n\nrejected the state’s prediction that legalizing same-sex marriage would result in social discord,\nciting Watson v. City of Memphis, 373 U.S. 526, 535 (1963) (rejecting “community confusion\nand turmoil” as a reason to delay desegregation of public parks). Id. at 1227.\n\n       The Fourth Circuit in Bostic also applied strict scrutiny to strike down Virginia’s same-\nsex-marriage prohibitions as infringing on a fundamental right, citing Loving and observing that\n“[o]ver the decades, the Supreme Court has demonstrated that the right to marry is an expansive\nliberty interest that may stretch to accommodate changing societal norms.” 760 F.3d at 376. In a\nthoughtful opinion, the court analyzed each of the state’s proffered interests: maintaining control\nof the “definition of marriage,” adhering to the “tradition of opposite-sex marriage,” “protecting\nthe institution of marriage,” “encouraging responsible procreation,” and “promoting the optimal\nchildrearing environment.” Id. at 378. In each instance, the court found that there was no link\nbetween the state’s purported “compelling interest” and the exclusion of same-sex couples “from\nparticipating fully in our society, which is precisely the type of segregation that the Fourteenth\nAmendment cannot countenance.” Id. at 384. As to the state’s interest in federalism, the court\npointed to the long-recognized principle that “[s]tate laws defining and regulating marriage, of\ncourse, must respect the constitutional rights of persons,” id. at 379 (quoting Windsor, 133 S. Ct.\nat 2691), and highlighted Windsor’s reiteration of “Loving’s admonition that the states must\nexercise their authority without trampling constitutional guarantees.” Id. Addressing the state’s\ncontention that marriage under state law should be confined to opposite-sex couples because\nunintended pregnancies cannot result from same-sex unions, the court noted that “[b]ecause\nsame-sex couples and infertile opposite-sex couples are similarly situated, the Equal Protection\nClause counsels against treating these groups differently.” Id. at 381-82 (citing City of Cleburne\nv. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985)).\n\n       The Seventh Circuit’s Baskin opinion is firmly grounded in equal-protection analysis.\nThe court proceeded from the premise that “[d]iscrimination by a state or the federal government\nagainst a minority, when based on an immutable characteristic of the members of that minority\n(most familiarly skin color and gender), and occurring against an historical background of\ndiscrimination against the persons who have that characteristic, makes the discriminatory law or\npolicy constitutionally suspect.” 766 F.3d at 654. But the court also found that “discrimination\nagainst same-sex couples is irrational, and therefore unconstitutional even if the discrimination is\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                   Page 55\n\nnot subjected to heightened scrutiny.” Id. at 656. This conclusion was based on the court’s\nrejection of “the only rationale that the states put forth with any conviction—that same-sex\ncouples and their children don't need marriage because same-sex couples can't produce children,\nintended or unintended,” an argument “so full of holes that it cannot be taken seriously.” Id.\n(emphasis in original).      The court therefore found it unnecessary to engage in “the more\ncomplex analysis found in more closely balanced equal-protection cases” or under the due\nprocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id. at 656-57.\n\n       The Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Latta also focuses on equal-protection principles in\nfinding that Idaho’s and Nevada’s statutes and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex\nmarriage violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the Ninth Circuit had recently held in\nSmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Labs., 740 F.3d 471, 481 (9th Cir. 2014), that\nclassifications based on sexual orientation are subject to heightened scrutiny, a conclusion the\ncourt drew from its reading of Windsor to require assessment more rigorous than rational-basis\nreview, the path to finding an equal-protection violation was less than arduous. As did the Tenth\nCircuit in Kitchen, the court in Latta found it “wholly illogical” to think that same-sex marriage\nwould affect opposite-sex couples’ choices with regard to procreation.           Latta, 2014 WL\n4977682, *5 (citing Kitchen, 755 F.3d at 1223).\n\n       These four cases from our sister circuits provide a rich mine of responses to every\nrationale raised by the defendants in the Sixth Circuit cases as a basis for excluding same-sex\ncouples from contracting valid marriages. Indeed, it would seem unnecessary for this court to do\nmore than cite those cases in affirming the district courts’ decisions in the six cases now before\nus. Because the correct result is so obvious, one is tempted to speculate that the majority has\npurposefully taken the contrary position to create the circuit split regarding the legality of same-\nsex marriage that could prompt a grant of certiorari by the Supreme Court and an end to the\nuncertainty of status and the interstate chaos that the current discrepancy in state laws threatens.\nPerhaps that is the case, but it does not relieve the dissenting member of the panel from the\nobligation of a rejoinder.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818              DeBoer v. Snyder                          Page 56\n\nBaker v. Nelson\n\n        If ever there was a legal “dead letter” emanating from the Supreme Court, Baker v.\nNelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972), is a prime candidate. It lacks only a stake through its heart.\nNevertheless, the majority posits that we are bound by the Court’s aging one-line order denying\nreview of an appeal from the Minnesota Supreme Court “for want of a substantial federal\nquestion.” As the majority notes, the question concerned the state’s refusal to issue a marriage\nlicense to a same-sex couple, but the decision came at a point in time when sodomy was legal in\nonly one state in the country, Illinois, which had repealed its anti-sodomy statute in 1962. The\nMinnesota statute criminalizing same-sex intimate relations was not struck down until 2001,\nalmost 30 years after Baker was announced.4 The Minnesota Supreme Court’s denial of relief to\na same-sex couple in 1971 and the United States Supreme Court’s conclusion that there was no\nsubstantial federal question involved in the appeal thus is unsurprising. As the majority notes—\nnot facetiously, one hopes—“that was then; this is now.”\n\n        At the same time, the majority argues that we are bound by the eleven words in the order,\ndespite the Supreme Court silence on the matter in the 42 years since it was issued. There was\nno recognition of Baker in Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), nor in Lawrence v. Texas,\n539 U.S. 558 (2003), and not in Windsor, despite the fact that the dissenting judge in the Second\nCircuit’s opinion in Windsor made the same argument that the majority makes in this case. See\nWindsor v. United States, 699 F.3d 169, 189, 192-95 (2d Cir. 2012) (Straub, J., dissenting in part\nand concurring in part). And although the argument was vigorously pressed by the DOMA\nproponents in their Supreme Court brief in Windsor,5 neither Justice Kennedy in his opinion for\nthe court nor any of the four dissenting judges in their three separate opinions mentioned Baker.\nIn addition, the order was not cited in the three orders of October 6, 2014, denying certiorari in\nKitchen, Bostic, and Baskin. If this string of cases—Romer, Lawrence, Windsor, Kitchen, Bostic,\nand Baskin—does not represent the Court’s overruling of Baker sub silentio, it certainly creates\nthe “doctrinal development” that frees the lower courts from the strictures of a summary\n\n\n\n\n        4\n         See Doe v.

Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 344 (1975) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nDefinition of Marriage\n\n       The majority’s “original meaning” analysis strings together a number of case citations but\ncan tell us little about the Fourteenth Amendment, except to assure us that “the people who\nadopted the Fourteenth Amendment [never] understood it to require the States to change the\ndefinition of marriage.” The quick answer is that they undoubtedly did not understand that it\nwould also require school desegregation in 1955 or the end of miscegenation laws across the\ncountry, beginning in California in 1948 and culminating in the Loving decision in 1967.\nDespite a civil war, the end of slavery, and ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868,\nextensive litigation has been necessary to achieve even a modicum of constitutional protection\nfrom discrimination based on race, and it has occurred primarily by judicial decree, not by the\ndemocratic election process to which the majority suggests we should defer regarding\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\n       Moreover, the majority’s view of marriage as “a social institution defined by\nrelationships between men and women” is wisely described in the plural. There is not now and\nnever has been a universally accepted definition of marriage. In early Judeo-Christian law and\nthroughout the West in the Middle Ages, marriage was a religious obligation, not a civil status.\nHistorically, it has been pursued primarily as a political or economic arrangement. Even today,\npolygynous marriages outnumber monogamous ones—the practice is widespread in Africa, Asia,\nand the Middle East, especially in countries following Islamic law, which also recognizes\ntemporary marriages in some parts of the world. In Asia and the Middle East, many marriages\nare still arranged and some are even coerced.\n\n       Although some of the older statutes regarding marriage cited by the majority do speak of\nthe union of “a man and a woman,” the picture hardly ends there. When Justice Alito noted in\nWindsor that the opponents of DOMA were “implicitly ask[ing] us to endorse [a more expansive\ndefinition of marriage and] to reject the traditional view,” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2718 (Alito, J.,\ndissenting), he may have been unfamiliar with all that the “traditional view” entailed, especially\nfor women who were subjected to coverture as a result of Anglo-American common law.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 58\n\nFourteenth Amendment cases decided by the Supreme Court in the years since 1971 that\n“invalidat[ed] various laws and policies that categorized by sex have been part of a\ntransformation that has altered the very institution at the heart of this case, marriage.” Latta,\n2014 WL 4977682, at *20 (Berzon, J., concurring).\n\n       Historically, marriage was a profoundly unequal institution, one that imposed\n       distinctly different rights and obligations on men and women. The law of\n       coverture, for example, deemed the “the husband and wife . . . one person,” such\n       that “the very being or legal existence of the woman [was] suspended . . . or at\n       least [was] incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband” during the\n       marriage. 1 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 441 (3d\n       rev. ed. 1884). Under the principles of coverture, “a married woman [was]\n       incapable, without her husband’s consent, of making contracts . . . binding on her\n       or him.” Bradwell v. Illinois, 83 U.S. 130, 141 (1872) (Bradley, J., concurring).\n       She could not sue or be sued without her husband’s consent. See, e.g., Nancy F.\n       Cott, Public Vows: A History of Marriage and the Nation 11–12 (2000). Married\n       women also could not serve as the legal guardians of their children. Frontiero v.\n       Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 685 (1973) (plurality op.).\n       Marriage laws further dictated economically disparate roles for husband and wife.\n       In many respects, the marital contract was primarily understood as an economic\n       arrangement between spouses, whether or not the couple had or would have\n       children. “Coverture expressed the legal essence of marriage as reciprocal: a\n       husband was bound to support his wife, and in exchange she gave over her\n       property and labor.” Cott, Public Vows, at 54. That is why “married women\n       traditionally were denied the legal capacity to hold or convey property . . . .”\n       Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 685. Notably, husbands owed their wives support even if\n       there were no children of the marriage. See, e.g., Hendrik Hartog, Man and Wife\n       in America: A History 156 (2000).\n       There was also a significant disparity between the rights of husbands and wives\n       with regard to physical intimacy. At common law, “a woman was the sexual\n       property of her husband; that is, she had a duty to have intercourse with him.”\n       John D’Emilio & Estelle B. Freedman, Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in\n       America 79 (3d ed. 2012). Quite literally, a wife was legally “the possession of\n       her husband, . . . [her] husband’s property.” Hartog, Man and Wife in America, at\n       137. Accordingly, a husband could sue his wife’s lover in tort for “entic[ing]” her\n       or “alienat[ing]” her affections and thereby interfering with his property rights in\n       her body and her labor. Id. A husband’s possessory interest in his wife was\n       undoubtedly also driven by the fact that, historically, marriage was the only legal\n       site for licit sex; sex outside of marriage was almost universally criminalized. See,\n       e.g., Ariela R. Dubler, Immoral Purposes: Marriage and the Genus of Illicit Sex,\n       115 Yale L.J. 756, 763–64 (2006).\n       Notably, although sex was strongly presumed to be an essential part of marriage,\n       the ability to procreate was generally not. See, e.g., Chester Vernier, American\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 59\n\n       Family Laws: A Comparative Study of the Family Law of the Forty-Eight\n       American States, Alaska, the District of Columbia, and Hawaii (to Jan. 1, 1931)\n       (1931) I § 50, 239–46 (at time of survey, grounds for annulment typically\n       included impotency, as well as incapacity due to minority or “non-age”; lack of\n       understanding and insanity; force or duress; fraud; disease; and incest; but not\n       inability to conceive); II § 68, at 38–39 (1932) (at time of survey, grounds for\n       divorce included “impotence”; vast majority of states “generally held that\n       impotence. . . does not mean sterility but must be of such a nature as to render\n       complete sexual intercourse practically impossible”; and only Pennsylvania\n       “ma[d]e sterility a cause” for divorce).\n       The common law also dictated that it was legally impossible for a man to rape his\n       wife. Men could not be prosecuted for spousal rape. A husband’s “incapacity” to\n       rape his wife was justified by the theory that “‘the marriage constitute[d] a\n       blanket consent to sexual intimacy which the woman [could] revoke only by\n       dissolving the marital relationship.’” See, e.g., Jill Elaine Hasday, Contest and\n       Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape, 88 Calif. L. Rev 1373, 1376 n.9\n       (2000) (quoting Model Penal Code and Commentaries, § 213.1 cmt. 8(c), at 342\n       (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1980)).\n       Concomitantly, dissolving the marital partnership via divorce was exceedingly\n       difficult. Through the mid-twentieth century, divorce could be obtained only on a\n       limited set of grounds, if at all. At the beginning of our nation’s history, several\n       states did not permit full divorce except under the narrowest of circumstances;\n       separation alone was the remedy, even if a woman could show “cruelty\n       endangering life or limb.” Peter W. Bardaglio, Reconstructing the Household:\n       Families, Sex, and the Law in the Nineteenth-Century South 33 (1995); see also\n       id. 32–33. In part, this policy dovetailed with the grim fact that, at English\n       common law, and in several states through the beginning of the nineteenth\n       century, “a husband’s prerogative to chastise his wife”—that is, to beat her short\n       of permanent injury—was recognized as his marital right. Reva B. Siegel, “The\n       Rule of Love”: Wife Beating as Prerogative and Privacy, 105 Yale L.J. 2117,\n       2125 (1996).\n\nId. at *20-21.\n\n       Women were not the only class deprived of equal status in “traditional marriage.” Until\nthe end of the Civil War in 1865, slaves were prohibited from contracting legal marriages and\noften resorted to “jumping the broomstick” to mark a monogamous conjugal relationship.\nInformal “slave marriage” was the rule until the end of the war, when Freedmen’s Bureaus began\nissuing marriage licenses to former slaves who could establish the existence of long-standing\nfamily relationships, despite the fact that family members were sometimes at great distances\nfrom one another. The ritual of jumping the broomstick, thought of in this country in terms of\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                  Page 60\n\nslave marriages, actually originated in England, where civil marriages were not available until\nenactment of the Marriage Act of 1837. Prior to that, the performance of valid marriages was the\nsole prerogative of the Church of England, unless the participants were Quakers or Jews. The\nmajority’s admiration for “traditional marriage” thus seems misplaced, if not naïve. The legal\nstatus has been through so many reforms that the marriage of same-sex couples constitutes\nmerely the latest wave in a vast sea of change.\n\nRational-Basis Review.\n\n       The principal thrust of the majority’s rational-basis analysis is basically a reiteration of\nthe same tired argument that the proponents of same-sex-marriage bans have raised in litigation\nacross the country: marriage is about the regulation of “procreative urges” of men and women\nwho therefore do not need the “government’s encouragement to have sex” but, instead, need\nencouragement to “create and maintain stable relationships within which children may flourish.”\nThe majority contends that exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage must be considered\nrational based on “the biological reality that couples of the same sex do not have children in the\nsame way as couples of opposite sexes and that couples of the same sex do not run the risk of\nunintended children.” As previously noted, however, this argument is one that an eminent jurist\nhas described as being “so full of holes that it cannot be taken seriously.” Baskin, 766 F.3d at\n656 (Posner, J.).\n\n       At least my colleagues are perceptive enough to acknowledge that “[g]ay couples, no less\nthan straight couples, are capable of sharing such relationships . . . [and] are capable of raising\nstable families.” The majority is even persuaded that the “quality of [same-sex] relationships,\nand the capacity to raise children within them, turns not on sexual orientation but on individual\nchoices and individual commitment.” All of which, the majority surmises, “supports the policy\nargument made by many that marriage laws should be extended to gay couples.” But this\nconclusion begs the question: why reverse the judgments of four federal district courts, in four\ndifferent states, and in six different cases that would do just that?\n\n       There are apparently two answers; first, “let the people decide” and, second, “give it\ntime.” The majority posits that “just as [same-sex marriage has been adopted in] nineteen states\nand the District of Columbia,” the change-agents in the Sixth Circuit should be “elected\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818              DeBoer v. Snyder                          Page 61\n\nlegislators, not life-tenured judges.”           Of course, this argument fails to acknowledge the\nimpracticalities involved in amending, re-amending, or un-amending a state constitution.6 More\nto the point, under our constitutional system, the courts are assigned the responsibility of\ndetermining individual rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, regardless of popular opinion or\neven a plebiscite. As the Supreme Court has noted, “It is plain that the electorate as a whole,\nwhether by referendum or otherwise, could not order [government] action violative of the Equal\nProtection Clause, and the [government] may not avoid the strictures of that Clause by deferring\nto the wishes or objections of some fraction of the body politic.” City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at\n448 (internal citation omitted).\n\n        Moreover, as it turns out, legalization of same-sex marriage in the “nineteen states and\nthe District of Columbia” mentioned by the majority was not uniformly the result of popular vote\nor legislative enactment.         Nine states now permit same-sex marriage because of judicial\ndecisions, both state and federal: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, New Mexico, and Colorado\n(state supreme court decisions); New Jersey (state superior court decision not appealed by\ndefendant); California (federal district court decision allowed to stand in ruling by United States\nSupreme Court); and Oregon and Pennsylvania (federal district court decisions not appealed by\ndefendants). Despite the majority’s insistence that, as life-tenured judges, we should step aside\nand let the voters determine the future of the state constitutional provisions at issue here, those\nnine federal and state courts have seen no acceptable reason to do so. In addition, another\n16 states have been or soon will be added to the list, by virtue of the Supreme Court’s denial of\ncertiorari review in Kitchen, Bostick, and Baskin, and the Court’s order dissolving the stay in\nLatta. The result has been the issuance of hundreds—perhaps thousands—of marriage licenses\nin the wake of those orders. Moreover, the 35 states that are now positioned to recognize same-\nsex marriage are comparable to the 34 states that permitted interracial marriage when the\n\n\n        6\n          In Tennessee, for example, a proposed amendment must first be approved by a simple majority of both\nhouses. In the succeeding legislative session, which can occur as long as a year or more later, the same proposed\namendment must then be approved “by two-thirds of all the members elected to each house.” Tenn. Const. art. XI,\n§ 3. The proposed amendment is then presented “to the people at the next general election in which a Governor is to\nbe chosen,” id., which can occur as long as three years or more later. If a majority of all citizens voting in the\ngubernatorial election also approve of the proposed amendment, it is considered ratified. The procedure for\namending the constitution by convention can take equally long and is, if anything, more complicated. In Michigan,\na constitutional convention, one of three methods of amendment, can be called no more often than every 16 years.\nSee Mich. Const. art. XII, § 3.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                      Page 62\n\nSupreme Court decided Loving. If the majority in this case is waiting for a tipping point, it\nseems to have arrived.\n\n         The second contention is that we should “wait and see” what the fallout is in the states\nwhere same-sex marriage is now legal. The majority points primarily to Massachusetts, where\nsame-sex couples have had the benefit of marriage for “only” ten years—not enough time, the\nmajority insists, to know what the effect on society will be. But in the absence of hard evidence\nthat the sky has actually fallen in, the “states as laboratories of democracy” metaphor and its\npitch for restraint has little or no resonance in the fast-changing scene with regard to same-sex\nmarriage. Yet, whenever the expansion of a constitutional right is proposed, “proceed with\ncaution” seems to be the universal mantra of the opponents. The same argument was made by\nthe State of Virginia in Loving. And, in Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), the\ngovernment asked the Court to postpone applying heightened scrutiny to allegations of gender\ndiscrimination in a statute denying equal benefits to women until the Equal Rights Amendment\ncould be ratified. If the Court had listened to the argument, we would, of course, still be waiting.\nOne is reminded of the admonition in Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail”\n(1963): “For years now I have heard the word \"Wait”! . . . [But h]uman progress never rolls in\non wheels of inevitability . . . [and] time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation.”\n\nAnimus\n\n         Finally, there is a need to address briefly the subject of unconstitutional animus, which\nthe majority opinion equates only with actual malice and hostility on the part of members of the\nelectorate. But in many instances involving rational-basis review, the Supreme Court has taken a\nmore objective approach to the classification at issue, rather than a subjective one. Under such\nan analysis, it is not necessary for a court to divine individual malicious intent in order to find\nunconstitutional animus. Instead, the Supreme Court has instructed that an exclusionary law\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause when it is based not upon relevant facts, but instead upon\nonly a general, ephemeral distrust of, or discomfort with, a particular group, for example, when\nlegislation is justified by the bare desire to exclude an unpopular group from a social institution\nor arrangement. In City of Cleburne, for example, the Court struck down a zoning regulation\nthat was justified simply by the “negative attitude” of property owners in the community toward\nindividuals with intellectual disabilities, not necessarily by actual malice toward an unpopular\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 63\n\nminority. In doing so, the Court held that “the City may not avoid the strictures of the [Equal\nProtection] Clause by deferring to the wishes or objections of some fraction of the body politic,”\n473 U.S. at 448, and cited Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433 (1984), for the proposition that\n“[p]rivate biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly,\ngive them effect.” In any event, as the majority here concedes, we as a country have such a long\nhistory of prejudice based on sexual orientation that it seems hypocritical to deny the existence\nof unconstitutional animus in the rational-basis analysis of the cases before us.\n\n       To my mind, the soundest description of this analysis is found in Justice Stevens’s\nseparate opinion in City of Cleburne:\n\n       In every equal protection case, we have to ask certain basic questions. What class\n       is harmed by the legislation, and has it been subjected to a “tradition of disfavor”\n       by our laws? What is the public purpose that is being served by the law? What is\n       the characteristic of the disadvantaged class that justifies the disparate treatment?\n       In most cases the answer to these questions will tell us whether the statute has a\n       “rational basis.”\n\nId. at 453 (Stevens, J., concurring) (footnotes omitted). I would apply just this analysis to the\nconstitutional amendments and statutes at issue in these cases, confident that the result of the\ninquiry would be to affirm the district courts’ decisions in all six cases. I therefore dissent from\nthe majority’s decision to overturn those judgments.\n\n       Today, my colleagues seem to have fallen prey to the misguided notion that the intent of\nthe framers of the United States Constitution can be effectuated only by cleaving to the\nlegislative will and ignoring and demonizing an independent judiciary. Of course, the framers\npresciently recognized that two of the three co-equal branches of government were representative\nin nature and necessarily would be guided by self-interest and the pull of popular opinion. To\nrestrain those natural, human impulses, the framers crafted Article III to ensure that rights,\nliberties, and duties need not be held hostage by popular whims.\n\n       More than 20 years ago, when I took my oath of office to serve as a judge on the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, I solemnly swore to “administer justice without\nrespect to persons,” to “do equal right to the poor and to the rich,” and to “faithfully and\nimpartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me . . . under the Constitution\nand laws of the United States.” See 28 U.S.C. § 453. If we in the judiciary do not have the\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818     DeBoer v. Snyder                   Page 64\n\nauthority, and indeed the responsibility, to right fundamental wrongs left excused by a majority\nof the electorate, our whole intricate, constitutional system of checks and balances, as well as\nthe oaths to which we swore, prove to be nothing but shams.\n\f",

This is a case about change—and how best to handle it under\nthe United States Constitution. From the vantage point of 2014, it would now seem, the question\nis not whether American law will allow gay couples to marry; it is when and how that will\nhappen. That would not have seemed likely as recently as a dozen years ago. For better, for\nworse, or for more of the same, marriage has long been a social institution defined by\nrelationships between men and women. So long defined, the tradition is measured in millennia,\nnot centuries or decades. So widely shared, the tradition until recently had been adopted by all\ngovernments and major religions of the world.\n\n       But things change, sometimes quickly. Since 2003, nineteen States and the District of\nColumbia have expanded the definition of marriage to include gay couples, some through state\nlegislation, some through initiatives of the people, some through state court decisions, and some\nthrough the actions of state governors and attorneys general who opted not to appeal adverse\ncourt decisions. Nor does this momentum show any signs of slowing. Twelve of the nineteen\nStates that now recognize gay marriage did so in the last couple of years. On top of that, four\nfederal courts of appeals have compelled several other States to permit same-sex marriages under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                      Page 8\n\n       What remains is a debate about whether to allow the democratic processes begun in the\nStates to continue in the four States of the Sixth Circuit or to end them now by requiring all\nStates in the Circuit to extend the definition of marriage to encompass gay couples. Process and\nstructure matter greatly in American government. Indeed, they may be the most reliable, liberty-\nassuring guarantees of our system of government, requiring us to take seriously the route the\nUnited States Constitution contemplates for making such a fundamental change to such a\nfundamental social institution.\n\n       Of all the ways to resolve this question, one option is not available: a poll of the three\njudges on this panel, or for that matter all federal judges, about whether gay marriage is a good\nidea. Our judicial commissions did not come with such a sweeping grant of authority, one that\nwould allow just three of us—just two of us in truth—to make such a vital policy call for the\nthirty-two million citizens who live within the four States of the Sixth Circuit: Kentucky,\nMichigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. What we have authority to decide instead is a legal question:\nDoes the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibit a State from defining\nmarriage as a relationship between one man and one woman?\n\n       Through a mixture of common law decisions, statutes, and constitutional provisions, each\nState in the Sixth Circuit has long adhered to the traditional definition of marriage. Sixteen gay\nand lesbian couples claim that this definition violates their rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. The circumstances that gave rise to the challenges vary. Some involve a birth,\nothers a death.   Some involve concerns about property, taxes, and insurance, others death\ncertificates and rights to visit a partner or partner’s child in the hospital. Some involve a\ncouple’s effort to obtain a marriage license within their State, others an effort to achieve\nrecognition of a marriage solemnized in another State. All seek dignity and respect, the same\ndignity and respect given to marriages between opposite-sex couples. And all come down to the\nsame question: Who decides? Is this a matter that the National Constitution commits to\nresolution by the federal courts or leaves to the less expedient, but usually reliable, work of the\nstate democratic processes?\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                      Page 9\n\n                                                  I.\n\n        Michigan. One case comes from Michigan, where state law has defined marriage as a\nrelationship between a man and a woman since its territorial days. See An Act Regulating\nMarriages § 1 (1820), in 1 Laws of the Territory of Michigan 646, 646 (1871). The State\nreaffirmed this view in 1996 when it enacted a law that declared marriage “inherently a unique\nrelationship between a man and a woman.” Mich. Comp. Laws § 551.1. In 2004, after the\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court invalidated the Commonwealth’s prohibition on same-sex\nmarriage, Goodridge v. Dep’t of Pub. Health, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. 2003), nearly fifty-nine\npercent of Michigan voters opted to constitutionalize the State’s definition of marriage. “To\nsecure and preserve the benefits of marriage for our society and for future generations of\nchildren,” the amendment says, “the union of one man and one woman in marriage shall be the\nonly agreement recognized as a marriage or similar union for any purpose.” Mich. Const. art. I,\n§ 25.\n\n        April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, a lesbian couple living in Michigan, challenge the\nconstitutionality of this definition. Marriage was not their first objective. DeBoer and Rowse\neach had adopted children as single parents, and both wanted to serve as adoptive parents for the\nother partner’s children. Their initial complaint alleged that Michigan’s adoption laws violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The State moved to dismiss the\nlawsuit for lack of standing, and the district court tentatively agreed. Rather than dismissing the\naction, the court “invit[ed the] plaintiffs to seek leave to amend their complaint to . . . challenge”\nMichigan’s laws denying them a marriage license. DeBoer R. 151 at 3. DeBoer and Rowse\naccepted the invitation and filed a new complaint alleging that Michigan’s marriage laws\nviolated the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n        Both sets of parties moved for summary judgment. The district court concluded that the\ndispute raised “a triable issue of fact” over whether the “rationales” for the Michigan laws\nfurthered “a legitimate state interest,” and it held a nine-day trial on the issue. DeBoer R. 89 at\n4, 8. The plaintiffs’ experts testified that same-sex couples raise children as well as opposite-sex\ncouples, and that denying marriage to same-sex couples creates instabilities for their children and\nfamilies. The defendants’ experts testified that the evidence regarding the comparative success\nof children raised in same-sex households is inconclusive. The district court sided with the\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 10\n\nplaintiffs. It rejected all of the State’s bases for its marriage laws and concluded that the laws\nfailed to satisfy rational basis review.\n\n        Kentucky. Two cases challenge two aspects of Kentucky’s marriage laws. Early on,\nKentucky defined marriage as “the union of a man and a woman.”                Jones v. Hallahan,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 589 (Ky. 1973); see An Act for Regulating the Solemnization of Marriages § 1,\n1798 Ky. Acts 49, 49–50. In 1998, the Kentucky legislature codified the common law definition.\nThe statute says that “‘marriage’ refers only to the civil status, condition, or relation of one\n(1) man and one (1) woman united in law for life, for the discharge to each other and the\ncommunity of the duties legally incumbent upon those whose association is founded on the\ndistinction of sex.” Ky. Rev. Stat. § 402.005. In 2004, the Kentucky legislature proposed a\nconstitutional amendment providing that “[o]nly a marriage between one man and one woman\nshall be valid or recognized as a marriage in Kentucky.” Ky. Const. § 233A. Seventy-four\npercent of the voters approved the amendment.\n\n        Two groups of plaintiffs challenge these Kentucky laws. One group, the fortuitously\nnamed Love plaintiffs, challenges the Commonwealth’s marriage-licensing law. Two couples\nfiled that lawsuit: Timothy Love and Lawrence Ysunza, along with Maurice Blanchard and\nDominique James. Both couples claim that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits Kentucky from\ndenying them marriage licenses.\n\n        The other group, the Bourke plaintiffs, challenges the ban on recognizing out-of-state\nsame-sex marriages. Four same-sex couples filed the lawsuit: Gregory Bourke and Michael\nDeLeon; Jimmy Meade and Luther Barlowe; Randell Johnson and Paul Campion; and Kimberly\nFranklin and Tamera Boyd. All four couples were married outside Kentucky, and they contend\nthat the State’s recognition ban violates their due process and equal protection rights. Citing the\nhardships imposed on them by the recognition ban—loss of tax breaks, exclusion from intestacy\nlaws, loss of dignity—they seek to enjoin its enforcement.\n\n        The district court ruled for the plaintiffs in both cases. In Love, the court held that the\nCommonwealth could not justify its definition of marriage on rational basis grounds. It also\nthought that classifications based on sexual orientation should be subjected to intermediate\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 11\n\nscrutiny, which the Commonwealth also failed to satisfy. In Bourke, the court invalidated the\nrecognition ban on rational basis grounds.\n\n       Ohio. Two cases challenge Ohio’s refusal to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages.\nOhio also has long adhered to the traditional definition of marriage. See An Act Regulating\nMarriages § 1, 1803 Ohio Laws 31, 31; Carmichael v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St.</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560 (1861). It\nreaffirmed this definition in 2004, when the legislature passed a Defense of Marriage Act, which\nsays that marriage “may only be entered into by one man and one woman.” Ohio Rev. Code\n§ 3101.01(A). “Any marriage entered into by persons of the same sex in any other jurisdiction,”\nit adds, “shall be considered and treated in all respects as having no legal force or effect.” Id.\n§ 3101.01(C)(2). Later that same year, sixty-two percent of Ohio voters approved an amendment\nto the Ohio Constitution along the same lines. As amended, the Ohio Constitution says that Ohio\nrecognizes only “a union between one man and one woman” as a valid marriage. Ohio Const.\nart. XV, § 11.\n\n       Two groups of plaintiffs challenge these Ohio laws. The first group, the Obergefell\nplaintiffs, focuses on one application of the law. They argue that Ohio’s refusal to recognize\ntheir out-of-state marriages on Ohio-issued death certificates violates due process and equal\nprotection. Two same-sex couples in long-term, committed relationships filed the lawsuit:\nJames Obergefell and John Arthur; and David Michener and William Herbert Ives. All four of\nthem are from Ohio and were married in other States. When Arthur and Ives died, the State\nwould not list Obergefell and Michener as spouses on their death certificates. Obergefell and\nMichener sought an injunction to require the State to list them as spouses on the certificates.\nRobert Grunn, a funeral director, joined the lawsuit, asking the court to protect his right to\nrecognize same-sex marriages on other death certificates.\n\n       The second group, the Henry plaintiffs, raises a broader challenge. They argue that\nOhio’s refusal to recognize out-of-state marriages between same-sex couples violates the\nFourteenth Amendment no matter what marital benefit is affected. The Henry case involves four\nsame-sex couples, all married in other States, who want Ohio to recognize their marriages on\ntheir children’s birth certificates. Three of the couples (Brittani Henry and Brittni Rogers;\nNicole and Pam Yorksmith; Kelly Noe and Kelly McCracken) gave birth to children in Ohio and\nwish to have both of their names listed on each child’s birth certificate rather than just the child’s\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 12\n\nbiological mother. The fourth couple (Joseph Vitale and Robert Talmas) lives in New York and\nadopted a child born in Ohio. They seek to amend their son’s Ohio birth certificate so that it lists\nboth of them as parents.\n\n       The district court granted the plaintiffs relief in both cases. In Obergefell, the court\nconcluded that the Fourteenth Amendment protects a fundamental right to keep existing marital\nrelationships intact, and that the State failed to justify its law under heightened scrutiny. The\ncourt likewise concluded that classifications based on sexual orientation deserve heightened\nscrutiny under equal protection, and that Ohio failed to justify its refusal to recognize the\ncouples’ existing marriages. Even under rational basis review, the court added, the State came\nup short. In Henry, the district court reached many of the same conclusions and expanded its\nrecognition remedy to encompass all married same-sex couples and all legal incidents of\nmarriage under Ohio law.\n\n       Tennessee. The Tennessee case is of a piece with the two Ohio cases and one of the\nKentucky cases, as it too challenges the State’s same-sex-marriage recognition ban. Tennessee\nhas always defined marriage in traditional terms. See An Act Concerning Marriages § 3 (1741),\nin Public Acts of the General Assembly of North-Carolina and Tennessee 46, 46 (1815). In\n1996, the Tennessee legislature reaffirmed “that the historical institution and legal contract\nsolemnizing the relationship of one (1) man and one (1) woman shall be the only legally\nrecognized marital contract in this state in order to provide the unique and exclusive rights and\nprivileges to marriage.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-3-113(a). In 2006, the State amended its\nconstitution to incorporate the existing definition of marriage. See Tenn. Const. art. XI, § 18.\nEighty percent of the voters supported the amendment.\n\n       Three same-sex couples, all in committed relationships, challenge the recognition ban:\nValeria Tanco and Sophy Jesty; Ijpe DeKoe and Thomas Kostura; and Johno Espejo and\nMatthew Mansell. All three couples were legally married in other States. The district court\npreliminarily enjoined the law.     Relying on district court decisions within the circuit and\nelsewhere, the court concluded that the couples likely would show that Tennessee’s ban failed to\nsatisfy rational basis review. The remaining preliminary injunction factors, the court held, also\nweighed in the plaintiffs’ favor.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 13\n\n        All four States appealed the decisions against them.\n\n                                                II.\n\n        Does the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment require States to expand the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples?\nThe Michigan appeal (DeBoer) presents this threshold question, and so does one of the Kentucky\nappeals (Love). Caselaw offers many ways to think about the issue.\n\n                                                A.\n\n        Perspective of an intermediate court.      Start with a recognition of our place in the\nhierarchy of the federal courts. As an “inferior” court (the Constitution’s preferred term, not\nours), a federal court of appeals begins by asking what the Supreme Court’s precedents require\non the topic at hand. Just such a precedent confronts us.\n\n        In the early 1970s, a Methodist minister married Richard Baker and James McConnell in\nMinnesota. Afterwards, they sought a marriage license from the State. When the clerk of the\nstate court denied the request, the couple filed a lawsuit claiming that the denial of their request\nviolated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Baker v.\nNelson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1710631\"><a href=\"/opinion/1710631/baker-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186 (Minn. 1971). The Minnesota Supreme Court rejected both\nclaims. As for the due process claim, the state court reasoned: “The institution of marriage as a\nunion of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreation and rearing of children within a\nfamily, is as old as the book of Genesis. . . . This historic institution manifestly is more deeply\nfounded than the asserted contemporary concept of marriage and societal interests for which\npetitioners contend. The due process clause . . . is not a charter for restructuring it by judicial\nlegislation.”   Id.   As for the equal protection claim, the court reasoned:         “[T]he state’s\nclassification of persons authorized to marry” does not create an “irrational or invidious\ndiscrimination. . . . [T]hat the state does not impose upon heterosexual married couples a\ncondition that they have a proved capacity or declared willingness to procreate . . . [creates only\na] theoretically imperfect [classification] . . . [and] ‘abstract symmetry’ is not demanded by the\nFourteenth Amendment.” Id. at 187.

Snyder                     Page 14\n\nexplained, “there is a clear distinction between a marital restriction based merely upon race and\none based upon the fundamental difference in sex.” Baker, 191 N.W.2d at 187.\n\n       Baker and McConnell appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The Court rejected\ntheir challenge, issuing a one-line order stating that the appeal did not raise “a substantial federal\nquestion.” Baker v. Nelson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 810 (1972). This type of summary decision, it is true,\ndoes not bind the Supreme Court in later cases. But it does confine lower federal courts in later\ncases. It matters not whether we think the decision was right in its time, remains right today, or\nwill be followed by the Court in the future. Only the Supreme Court may overrule its own\nprecedents, and we remain bound even by its summary decisions “until such time as the Court\ninforms [us] that [we] are not.” Hicks v. Miranda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109296\"><a href=\"/opinion/109296/hicks-v-miranda/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 345 (1975) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).

Yet Windsor does not answer today’s question. The decision never mentions Baker,\nmuch less overrules it. And the outcomes of the cases do not clash. Windsor invalidated a\nfederal law that refused to respect state laws permitting gay marriage, while Baker upheld the\nright of the people of a State to define marriage as they see it. To respect one decision does not\nslight the other. Nor does Windsor’s reasoning clash with Baker. Windsor hinges on the\nDefense of Marriage Act’s unprecedented intrusion into the States’ authority over domestic\nrelations. Id. at 2691–92. Before the Act’s passage in 1996, the federal government had\ntraditionally relied on state definitions of marriage instead of purporting to define marriage itself.\nId. at 2691. That premise does not work—it runs the other way—in a case involving a challenge\nin federal court to state laws defining marriage. The point of Windsor was to prevent the Federal\nGovernment from “divest[ing]” gay couples of “a dignity and status of immense import” that\nNew York’s extension of the definition of marriage gave them, an extension that “without doubt”\nany State could provide. Id. at 2692, 2695.

Hicks, 422 U.S. at 344. And Windsor, they say, together with\nLawrence v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003), and Romer v.

But this reading of “doctrinal developments” would be a groundbreaking\ndevelopment of its own. From the perspective of a lower court, summary dispositions remain\n“controlling precedent, unless and until re-examined by [the Supreme] Court.” Tully v. Griffin,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109559\"><a href=\"/opinion/109559/tully-v-griffin-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74 (1976); see Hicks, 422 U.S. at 343–45. And the Court has told us to treat\nthe two types of decisions, whether summary dispositions or full-merits decisions, the same,\n“prevent[ing] lower courts” in both settings “from coming to opposite conclusions on the precise\nissues presented and necessarily decided by those actions.” Mandel v. Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109696\"><a href=\"/opinion/109696/mandel-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n176 (1977). Lest doubt remain, the Court has also told us not to ignore its decisions even when\nthey are in tension with a new line of cases. “If a precedent of this Court has direct application\nin a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of\nAppeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of\noverruling its own decisions.” Rodriguez de Quijas v.

Any other\napproach returns us to a world in which the lower courts may anticipatorily overrule all manner\nof Supreme Court decisions based on counting-to-five predictions, perceived trajectories in the\ncaselaw, or, worst of all, new appointments to the Court. In the end, neither of the two\npreconditions for ignoring Supreme Court precedent applies here. Windsor as shown does not\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 16\n\nmention Baker, and it clarifies that its “opinion and holding” do not govern the States’ authority\nto define marriage. Hollingsworth was dismissed. And neither Lawrence nor Romer mentions\nBaker, and neither is inconsistent with its outcome. The one invalidates a State’s criminal\nantisodomy law and explains that the case “does not involve . . . formal recognition” of same-sex\nrelationships.   Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578.         The other invalidates a “[s]weeping” and\n“unprecedented” state law that prohibited local communities from passing laws that protect\ncitizens from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Romer, 517 U.S. at 627, 633, 635–36.\n\n       That brings us to another one-line order. On October 6, 2014, the Supreme Court\n“denied” the “petitions for writs of certiorari” in 1,575 cases, seven of which arose from\nchallenges to decisions of the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits that recognized a\nconstitutional right to same-sex marriage. But this kind of action (or inaction) “imports no\nexpression of opinion upon the merits of the case, as the bar has been told many times.” United\nStates v. Carver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100089\"><a href=\"/opinion/100089/united-states-v-carver/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490 (1923). “The ‘variety of considerations [that] underlie\ndenials of the writ’ counsels against according denials of certiorari any precedential value.”\nTeague v.

Just as the Court’s three\ndecisions to stay those same court of appeals decisions over the past year, all without a registered\ndissent, did not end the debate on this issue, so too the Court’s decision to deny certiorari in all\nof these appeals, all without a registered dissent, does not end the debate either. A decision not\nto decide is a decision not to decide.\n\n       But don’t these denials of certiorari signal that, from the Court’s perspective, the right to\nsame-sex marriage is inevitable? Maybe; maybe not. Even if we grant the premise and assume\nthat same-sex marriage will be recognized one day in all fifty States, that does not tell us how—\nwhether through the courts or through democracy. And, if through the courts, that does not tell\nus why—whether through one theory of constitutional invalidity or another. Four courts of\nappeals thus far have recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. They agree on one\nthing: the result. But they reach that outcome in many ways, often more than one way in the\nsame decision. See Bostic v.

La. 2014).\n\n       There are many ways, as these lower court decisions confirm, to look at this question:\noriginalism; rational basis review; animus; fundamental rights; suspect classifications; evolving\nmeaning. The parties in one way or another have invoked them all. Not one of the plaintiffs’\ntheories, however, makes the case for constitutionalizing the definition of marriage and for\nremoving the issue from the place it has been since the founding: in the hands of state voters.\n\n                                                B.\n\n       Original meaning. All Justices, past and present, start their assessment of a case about\nthe meaning of a constitutional provision by looking at how the provision was understood by the\npeople who ratified it. If we think of the Constitution as a covenant between the governed and\nthe governors, between the people and their political leaders, it is easy to appreciate the force of\nthis basic norm of constitutional interpretation—that the originally understood meaning of the\ncharter generally will be the lasting meaning of the charter. When two individuals sign a\ncontract to sell a house, no one thinks that, years down the road, one party to the contract may\nchange the terms of the deal. That is why the parties put the agreement in writing and signed it\npublicly—to prevent changed perceptions and needs from changing the guarantees in the\nagreement.    So it normally goes with the Constitution:        The written charter cements the\nlimitations on government into an unbending bulwark, not a vane alterable whenever alterations\noccur—unless and until the people, like contracting parties, choose to change the contract\nthrough the agreed-upon mechanisms for doing so. See U.S. Const. art. V. If American lawyers\nin all manner of settings still invoke the original meaning of Magna Carta, a Charter for England\nin 1215, surely it is not too much to ask that they (and we) take seriously the original meaning of\nthe United States Constitution, a Charter for this country in 1789.

That is an occupational hazard for\njudges when it comes to old or generally worded provisions. Yet that knotty problem does not\nconfront us. Yes, the Fourteenth Amendment is old; the people ratified it in 1868. And yes, it is\ngenerally worded; it says: “[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of\nthe laws.” Nobody in this case, however, argues that the people who adopted the Fourteenth\nAmendment understood it to require the States to change the definition of marriage.\n\n       Tradition reinforces the point. Only months ago, the Supreme Court confirmed the\nsignificance of long-accepted usage in constitutional interpretation. In one case, the Court held\nthat the customary practice of opening legislative meetings with prayer alone proves the\nconstitutional permissibility of legislative prayer, quite apart from how that practice might fare\nunder the most up-to-date Establishment Clause test.

Hesitant, yes; but still a\nrational basis, some rational basis, must exist for the definition. What is it? Two at a minimum\nsuffice to meet this low bar. One starts from the premise that governments got into the business\nof defining marriage, and remain in the business of defining marriage, not to regulate love but to\nregulate sex, most especially the intended and unintended effects of male-female intercourse.\nImagine a society without marriage. It does not take long to envision problems that might result\nfrom an absence of rules about how to handle the natural effects of male-female intercourse:\nchildren. May men and women follow their procreative urges wherever they take them? Who is\nresponsible for the children that result? How many mates may an individual have? How does\none decide which set of mates is responsible for which set of children? That we rarely think\nabout these questions nowadays shows only how far we have come and how relatively stable our\nsociety is, not that States have no explanation for creating such rules in the first place.\n\n       Once one accepts a need to establish such ground rules, and most especially a need to\ncreate stable family units for the planned and unplanned creation of children, one can well\nappreciate why the citizenry would think that a reasonable first concern of any society is the need\nto regulate male-female relationships and the unique procreative possibilities of them. One way\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 20\n\nto pursue this objective is to encourage couples to enter lasting relationships through subsidies\nand other benefits and to discourage them from ending such relationships through these and other\nmeans. People may not need the government’s encouragement to have sex. And they may not\nneed the government’s encouragement to propagate the species. But they may well need the\ngovernment’s encouragement to create and maintain stable relationships within which children\nmay flourish. It is not society’s laws or for that matter any one religion’s laws, but nature’s laws\n(that men and women complement each other biologically), that created the policy imperative.\nAnd governments typically are not second-guessed under the Constitution for prioritizing how\nthey tackle such issues. Dandridge v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108115\"><a href=\"/opinion/108115/dandridge-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 486–87 (1970).\n\n       No doubt, that is not the only way people view marriage today. Over time, marriage has\ncome to serve another value—to solemnize relationships characterized by love, affection, and\ncommitment.     Gay couples, no less than straight couples, are capable of sharing such\nrelationships. And gay couples, no less than straight couples, are capable of raising children and\nproviding stable families for them. The quality of such relationships, and the capacity to raise\nchildren within them, turns not on sexual orientation but on individual choices and individual\ncommitment. All of this supports the policy argument made by many that marriage laws should\nbe extended to gay couples, just as nineteen States have done through their own sovereign\npowers. Yet it does not show that the States, circa 2014, suddenly must look at this policy issue\nin just one way on pain of violating the Constitution.\n\n       The signature feature of rational basis review is that governments will not be placed in\nthe dock for doing too much or for doing too little in addressing a policy question. Id. In a\nmodern sense, crystallized at some point in the last ten years, many people now critique state\nmarriage laws for doing too little—for being underinclusive by failing to extend the definition of\nmarriage to gay couples. Fair enough. But rational basis review does not permit courts to\ninvalidate laws every time a new and allegedly better way of addressing a policy emerges, even a\nbetter way supported by evidence and, in the Michigan case, by judicial factfinding.              If\nlegislative choices may rest on “rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data,”\nBeach Commc’ns, 508 U.S. at 315, it is hard to see the point of premising a ruling of\nunconstitutionality on factual findings made by one unelected federal judge that favor a different\npolicy. Rational basis review does not empower federal courts to “subject” legislative line-\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 21\n\ndrawing to “courtroom” factfinding designed to show that legislatures have done too much or too\nlittle. Id.\n\n        What we are left with is this: By creating a status (marriage) and by subsidizing it (e.g.,\nwith tax-filing privileges and deductions), the States created an incentive for two people who\nprocreate together to stay together for purposes of rearing offspring. That does not convict the\nStates of irrationality, only of awareness of the biological reality that couples of the same sex do\nnot have children in the same way as couples of opposite sexes and that couples of the same sex\ndo not run the risk of unintended offspring. That explanation, still relevant today, suffices to\nallow the States to retain authority over an issue they have regulated from the beginning.\n\n        To take another rational explanation for the decision of many States not to expand the\ndefinition of marriage, a State might wish to wait and see before changing a norm that our\nsociety (like all others) has accepted for centuries. That is not preserving tradition for its own\nsake. No one here claims that the States’ original definition of marriage was unconstitutional\nwhen enacted. The plaintiffs’ claim is that the States have acted irrationally in standing by the\ntraditional definition in the face of changing social mores. Yet one of the key insights of\nfederalism is that it permits laboratories of experimentation—accent on the plural—allowing one\nState to innovate one way, another State another, and a third State to assess the trial and error\nover time. As a matter of state law, the possibility of gay marriage became real in 2003 with the\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court’s decision in Goodridge. Eleven years later, the clock\nhas not run on assessing the benefits and burdens of expanding the definition of marriage.\nEleven years indeed is not even the right timeline. The fair question is whether in 2004, one year\nafter Goodridge, Michigan voters could stand by the traditional definition of marriage. How can\nwe say that the voters acted irrationally for sticking with the seen benefits of thousands of years\nof adherence to the traditional definition of marriage in the face of one year of experience with a\nnew definition of marriage? A State still assessing how this has worked, whether in 2004 or\n2014, is not showing irrationality, just a sense of stability and an interest in seeing how the new\ndefinition has worked elsewhere. Even today, the only thing anyone knows for sure about the\nlong-term impact of redefining marriage is that they do not know. A Burkean sense of caution\ndoes not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, least of all when measured by a timeline less than a\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 22\n\ndozen years long and when assessed by a system of government designed to foster step-by-step,\nnot sudden winner-take-all, innovations to policy problems.\n\n       In accepting these justifications for the four States’ marriage laws, we do not deny the\nfoolish, sometimes offensive, inconsistencies that have haunted marital legislation from time to\ntime. States will hand some people a marriage license no matter how often they have divorced or\nremarried, apparently on the theory that practice makes perfect. States will not even prevent an\nindividual from remarrying the same person three or four times, where practice no longer seems\nto be the issue. With love and commitment nowhere to be seen, States will grant a marriage\nlicense to two friends who wish to share in the tax and other material benefits of marriage, at\nleast until the State’s no-fault divorce laws allow them to exit the partnership freely. And States\nallow couples to continue procreating no matter how little stability, safety, and love they provide\nthe children they already have. Nor has unjustified sanctimony stayed off the stage when it\ncomes to marital legislation—with monogamists who “do not monog” criticizing alleged\npolygamists who “do not polyg.” See Paul B. Beers, Pennsylvania Politics Today and Yesterday\n51 (1980).\n\n       How, the claimants ask, could anyone possibly be unworthy of this civil institution?\nAren’t gay and straight couples both capable of honoring this civil institution in some cases and\nof messing it up in others? All of this, however, proves much too much. History is replete with\nexamples of love, sex, and marriage tainted by hypocrisy. Without it, half of the world’s\nliterature, and three-quarters of its woe, would disappear. Throughout, we have never leveraged\nthese inconsistencies about deeply personal, sometimes existential, views of marriage into a\nground for constitutionalizing the field. Instead, we have allowed state democratic forces to fix\nthe problems as they emerge and as evolving community mores show they should be fixed.\nEven if we think about today’s issue and today’s alleged inconsistencies solely from the\nperspective of the claimants in this case, it is difficult to call that formula, already coming to\nterms with a new view of marriage, a failure.\n\n       Any other approach would create line-drawing problems of its own. Consider how\nplaintiffs’ love-and-commitment definition of marriage would fare under their own rational basis\ntest. Their definition does too much because it fails to account for the reality that no State in the\ncountry requires couples, whether gay or straight, to be in love. Their definition does too little\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818         DeBoer v. Snyder                      Page 23\n\nbecause it fails to account for plural marriages, where there is no reason to think that three or\nfour adults, whether gay, bisexual, or straight, lack the capacity to share love, affection, and\ncommitment, or for that matter lack the capacity to be capable (and more plentiful) parents to\nboot. If it is constitutionally irrational to stand by the man-woman definition of marriage, it must\nbe constitutionally irrational to stand by the monogamous definition of marriage. Plaintiffs have\nno answer to the point. What they might say they cannot: They might say that tradition or\ncommunity mores provide a rational basis for States to stand by the monogamy definition of\nmarriage, but they cannot say that because that is exactly what they claim is illegitimate about\nthe States’ male-female definition of marriage. The predicament does not end there. No State is\nfree of marriage policies that go too far in some directions and not far enough in others, making\nall of them vulnerable—if the claimants’ theory of rational basis review prevails.\n\n         Several cases illustrate just how seriously the federal courts must take the line-drawing\ndeference owed the democratic process under rational basis review. Massachusetts Board of\nRetirement v. Murgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109515\"><a href=\"/opinion/109515/massachusetts-bd-of-retirement-v-murgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), holds that a State may require law enforcement\nofficers to retire without exception at age fifty, in order to assure the physical fitness of its police\nforce.   If a rough correlation between age and strength suffices to uphold exception-free\nretirement ages (even though some fifty-year-olds swim/bike/run triathlons), why doesn’t a\ncorrelation between male-female intercourse and procreation suffice to uphold traditional\nmarriage laws (even though some straight couples don’t have kids and many gay couples do)?\nArmour v.

Can we honestly say that traditional marriage laws\ninvolve more irrationality than nepotism?\n\n         The debate over marriage of course has another side, and we cannot deny the costs to the\nplaintiffs of allowing the States to work through this profound policy debate. The traditional\ndefinition of marriage denies gay couples the opportunity to publicly solemnize, to say nothing\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 24\n\nof subsidize, their relationships under state law. In addition to depriving them of this status, it\ndeprives them of benefits that range from the profound (the right to visit someone in a hospital as\na spouse or parent) to the mundane (the right to file joint tax returns). These harms affect not\nonly gay couples but also their children. Do the benefits of standing by the traditional definition\nof marriage make up for these costs? The question demands an answer—but from elected\nlegislators, not life-tenured judges. Our task under the Supreme Court’s precedents is to decide\nwhether the law has some conceivable basis, not to gauge how that rationale stacks up against\nthe arguments on the other side. Respect for democratic control over this traditional area of state\nexpertise ensures that “a statewide deliberative process that enable[s] its citizens to discuss and\nweigh arguments for and against same-sex marriage” can have free and reasonable rein.\nWindsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2689.\n\n                                                D.\n\n       Animus. Given the broad deference owed the States under the democracy-reinforcing\nnorms of rational basis review, the cases in which the Supreme Court has struck down a state law\non that basis are few. When the Court has taken this step, it usually has been due to the novelty\nof the law and the targeting of a single group for disfavored treatment under it. In one case, a\ncity enacted a new zoning code with the none-too-subtle purpose of closing down a home for the\nintellectually disabled in a neighborhood that apparently wanted nothing to do with them. The\nreality that the code applied only to homes for the intellectually disabled—and not to other\ndwellings such as fraternity houses—led the Court to invalidate the regulation on the ground that\nthe city had based it upon “an irrational prejudice against the mentally retarded.” City of\nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 450 (1985). In another case, a statewide\ninitiative denied gays, and gays alone, access to the protection of the State’s existing\nantidiscrimination laws. The novelty of the law, coupled with the distance between the reach of\nthe law and any legitimate interest it might serve, showed that the law was “born of animosity\ntoward” gays and suggested a design to make gays “unequal to everyone else.” Romer, 517 U.S.\nat 634–35.\n\n       None of the statewide initiatives at issue here fits this pattern. The four initiatives,\nenacted between 2004 and 2006, codified a long-existing, widely held social norm already\nreflected in state law. “[M]arriage between a man and a woman,” as the Court reminded us just\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 25\n\nlast year, “had been thought of by most people as essential to the very definition of that term and\nto its role and function throughout the history of civilization.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2689.\n\n       Neither was the decision to place the definition of marriage in a State’s constitution\nunusual, nor did it otherwise convey the kind of malice or unthinking prejudice the\nConstitution prohibits. Nineteen States did the same thing during that period. Human Rights\nCampaign Found., Equality from State to State 2006, at 13–14 (2006), available at\nhttp://s3.amazonaws.com/hrc-assets//files/assets/resources/StateToState2007.pdf.      And if there\nwas one concern animating the initiatives, it was the fear that the courts would seize control over\nan issue that people of good faith care deeply about. If that is animus, the term has no useful\nmeaning.\n\n       Who in retrospect can blame the voters for having this fear? By then, several state courts\nhad altered their States’ traditional definitions of marriage under the States’ constitutions. Since\nthen, more have done the same. Just as state judges have the authority to construe a state\nconstitution as they see fit, so do the people have the right to overrule such decisions or preempt\nthem as they see fit. Nor is there anything static about this process. In some States, the people\nhave since re-amended their constitutions to broaden the category of those eligible to marry.\nIn other States, the people seemed primed to do the same but for now have opted to take a wait-\nand-see approach of their own as federal litigation proceeds. See, e.g., Wesley Lowery, Same-\nSex Marriage Is Gaining Momentum, but Some Advocates Don’t Want It on the Ballot in\nOhio, Wash. Post (June 14, 2014), http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/same-sex-marriage-\nis-gaining-momentum-but-ohio-advocates-dont-want-it-on-the-ballot/2014/06/14/a090452a-\ne77e-11e3-afc6-a1dd9407abcf_story.html (explaining that Ohio same-sex marriage advocates\nopted not to place the question on the 2014 state ballot despite collecting nearly twice the\nnumber of required signatures). What the Court recently said about another statewide initiative\nthat people care passionately about applies with equal vigor here: “Deliberative debate on\nsensitive issues such as racial preferences all too often may shade into rancor. But that does not\njustify removing certain court-determined issues from the voters’ reach. Democracy does not\npresume that some subjects are either too divisive or too profound for public debate.” Schuette v.\nCoal. to Defend Affirmative Action, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2672208\"><a href=\"/opinion/2672208/schuette-v-bamn/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If assessing the motives of multimember legislatures is difficult, assessing the motives of\nall voters in a statewide initiative strains judicial competence. The number of people who\nsupported each initiative—Michigan (2.7 million), Kentucky (1.2 million), Ohio (3.3 million),\nand Tennessee (1.4 million)—was large and surely diverse. In addition to the proper role of the\ncourts in a democracy, many other factors presumably influenced the voters who supported and\nopposed these amendments: that some politicians favored the amendment and others opposed it;\nthat some faith groups favored the amendment and others opposed it; that some thought the\namendment would strengthen families and others thought it would weaken them or were not\nsure; that some thought the amendment would be good for children and others thought it would\nnot be or were not sure; and that some thought the amendment would preserve a long-established\ndefinition of marriage and others thought it was time to accommodate gay couples. Even a\nrough sense of morality likely affected voters, with some thinking it immoral to exclude gay\ncouples and others thinking the opposite.        For most people, whether for or against the\namendment, the truth of why they did what they did is assuredly complicated, making it\nimpossible to pin down any one consideration, as opposed to a rough aggregation of factors, as\nmotivating them. How in this setting can we indict the 2.7 million Michigan voters who\nsupported the amendment in 2004, less than one year after the first state supreme court\nrecognized a constitutional right to gay marriage, for favoring the amendment for prejudicial\nreasons and for prejudicial reasons alone? Any such conclusion cannot be squared with the\nbenefit of the doubt customarily given voters and legislatures under rational basis review. Even\nthe gay-rights community, remember, was not of one mind about taking on the benefits and\nburdens of marriage until the early 1990s. See George Chauncey, Why Marriage? The History\nShaping Today’s Debate over Gay Equality 58, 88 (2004); Michael J. Klarman, From the Closet\nto the Altar: Courts, Backlash, and the Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage 48–52 (2013).

Even if we agreed with the claimants that the nature of these state\nconstitutional amendments, and the debates surrounding them, required their invalidation on\nanimus grounds, that would not give them what they request in their complaints: the right to\nsame-sex marriage.

Under the Due Process Clause, courts apply more muscular\nreview—“strict,” “rigorous,” usually unforgiving, scrutiny—to laws that impair “fundamental”\nrights. In considering the claimants’ arguments that they have a fundamental right to marry each\nother, we must keep in mind that something can be fundamentally important without being a\nfundamental right under the Constitution. Otherwise, state regulations of many deeply important\nsubjects—from education to healthcare to living conditions to decisions about when to die—\nwould be subject to unforgiving review.

Instead, the question is whether our nation has treated the right as\nfundamental and therefore worthy of protection under substantive due process. More precisely,\nthe test is whether the right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and “implicit\nin the concept of ordered liberty,” such that “neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were\nsacrificed.” Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721 (internal citations omitted). That requirement often is\nmet by placing the right in the Constitution, most obviously in (most of) the guarantees in the\nBill of Rights. See id. at 720. But the right to marry in general, and the right to gay marriage in\nparticular, nowhere appear in the Constitution. That route for recognizing a fundamental right to\nsame-sex marriage does not exist.\n\n       That leaves the other option—that, even though a proposed right to same-sex marriage\ndoes not appear in the Constitution, it turns on bedrock assumptions about liberty. This too does\nnot work. The first state high court to redefine marriage to include gay couples did not do so\nuntil 2003 in Goodridge.\n\n       Matters do not change because Loving v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107480\"><a href=\"/opinion/107480/loving-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1967), held that\n“marriage” amounts to a fundamental right. When the Court decided Loving, “marriage between\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 29\n\na man and a woman no doubt [was] thought of . . . as essential to the very definition of that\nterm.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2689. In referring to “marriage” rather than “opposite-sex\nmarriage,” Loving confirmed only that “opposite-sex marriage” would have been considered\nredundant, not that marriage included same-sex couples. Loving did not change the definition.\nThat is why the Court said marriage is “fundamental to our very existence and survival,”\n388 U.S. at 12, a reference to the procreative definition of marriage. Had a gay African-\nAmerican male and a gay Caucasian male been denied a marriage license in Virginia in 1968,\nwould the Supreme Court have held that Virginia had violated the Fourteenth Amendment? No\none to our knowledge thinks so, and no Justice to our knowledge has ever said so. The denial of\nthe license would have turned not on the races of the applicants but on a request to change the\ndefinition of marriage. Had Loving meant something more when it pronounced marriage a\nfundamental right, how could the Court hold in Baker five years later that gay marriage does not\neven raise a substantial federal question?        Loving addressed, and rightly corrected, an\nunconstitutional eligibility requirement for marriage; it did not create a new definition of\nmarriage.\n\n       A similar problem confronts the claimants’ reliance on other decisions treating marriage\nas a fundamental right, whether in the context of a statute denying marriage licenses to fathers\nwho could not pay child support, Zablocki v. Redhail, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109768\"><a href=\"/opinion/109768/zablocki-v-redhail/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383 (1978), or a regulation\nrestricting prisoners’ ability to obtain marriage licenses, Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94–95\n(1987). It strains credulity to believe that a year after each decision a gay indigent father could\nhave required the State to grant him a marriage license for his partnership or that a gay prisoner\ncould have required the State to permit him to marry a gay partner. When Loving and its\nprogeny used the word marriage, they did not redefine the term but accepted its traditional\nmeaning.\n\n       No doubt, many people, many States, even some dictionaries, now define marriage in a\nway that is untethered to biology. But that does not transform the fundamental-rights decision of\nLoving under the old definition into a constitutional right under the new definition. The question\nis whether the old reasoning applies to the new setting, not whether we can shoehorn new\nmeanings into old words. Else, evolving-norm lexicographers would have a greater say over the\nmeaning of the Constitution than judges.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 30\n\n       The upshot of fundamental-rights status, keep in mind, is strict-scrutiny status, subjecting\nall state eligibility rules for marriage to rigorous, usually unforgiving, review. That makes little\nsense with respect to the trials and errors societies historically have undertaken (and presumably\nwill continue to undertake) in determining who may enter and leave a marriage. Start with the\nduration of a marriage. For some, marriage is a commitment for life and beyond. For others, it\nis a commitment for life. For still others, it is neither. In 1969, California enacted the first pure\nno-fault divorce statute. See Family Law Act of 1969, 1969 Cal. Stat. 3312. A dramatic\nexpansion of similar laws followed. See Lynn D. Wardle, No-Fault Divorce and the Divorce\nConundrum, 1991 BYU L. Rev. 79, 90. The Court has never subjected these policy fits and\nstarts about who may leave a marriage to strict scrutiny.\n\n       Consider also the number of people eligible to marry. As late as the eighteenth century,\n“[t]he predominance of monogamy was by no means a foregone conclusion,” and “[m]ost of the\npeoples and cultures around the globe” had adopted a different system. Nancy F. Cott, Public\nVows: A History of Marriage and the Nation 9 (2000). Over time, American officials wove\nmonogamy into marriage’s fabric. Beginning in the nineteenth century, the federal government\n“encouraged or forced” Native Americans to adopt the policy, and in 1878 the Supreme Court\nupheld a federal antibigamy law.

And if it did, how would the constitutional,\nas opposed to policy, arguments in favor of same-sex marriage not apply to plural marriages?\n\n       Consider finally the nature of the individuals eligible to marry. The age of consent has\nnot remained constant, for example. Under Roman law, men could marry at fourteen, women at\ntwelve. The American colonies imported that rule from England and kept it until the mid-1800s,\nwhen the people began advocating for a higher minimum age. Today, all but two States set the\nnumber at eighteen. See Vivian E. Hamilton, The Age of Marital Capacity: Reconsidering Civil\nRecognition of Adolescent Marriage, 92 B.U. L. Rev. 1817, 1824–32 (2012). The same goes for\nthe social acceptability of marriage between cousins, a union deemed “desirable in many parts of\nthe world”; indeed, around “10 percent of marriages worldwide are between people who are\nsecond cousins or closer.” Sarah Kershaw, Living Together: Shaking Off the Shame, N.Y.

The Supreme Court has never held that legislative\nclassifications based on sexual orientation receive heightened review and indeed has not\nrecognized a new suspect class in more than four decades. There are ample reasons for staying\nthe course.    Courts consider four rough factors in deciding whether to treat a legislative\nclassification as suspect and presumptively unconstitutional: whether the group has been\nhistorically victimized by governmental discrimination; whether it has a defining characteristic\nthat legitimately bears on the classification; whether it exhibits unchanging characteristics that\ndefine it as a discrete group; and whether it is politically powerless. See Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at\n28.\n\n        We cannot deny the lamentable reality that gay individuals have experienced prejudice in\nthis country, sometimes at the hands of public officials, sometimes at the hands of fellow\ncitizens. Stonewall, Anita Bryant’s uninvited answer to the question “Who are we to judge?”,\nunequal enforcement of antisodomy laws between gay and straight partners, Matthew Shepard,\nand the language of insult directed at gays and others make it hard for anyone to deny the point.\nBut we also cannot deny that the institution of marriage arose independently of this record of\ndiscrimination. The traditional definition of marriage goes back thousands of years and spans\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 32\n\nalmost every society in history. By contrast, “American laws targeting same-sex couples did not\ndevelop until the last third of the 20th century.” Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 570. This order of events\nprevents us from inferring from history that prejudice against gays led to the traditional\ndefinition of marriage in the same way that we can infer from history that prejudice against\nAfrican Americans led to laws against miscegenation.            The usual leap from history of\ndiscrimination to intensification of judicial review does not work.\n\n       Windsor says nothing to the contrary. In arguing otherwise, plaintiffs mistake Windsor’s\navoidance of one federalism question for avoidance of federalism altogether. Here is the key\npassage:\n\n       Despite these considerations, it is unnecessary to decide whether this federal\n       intrusion on state power is a violation of the Constitution because it disrupts the\n       federal balance. The State’s power in defining the marital relation is of central\n       relevance in this case quite apart from principles of federalism. Here the State’s\n       decision to give this class of persons the right to marry conferred upon them a\n       dignity and status of immense import. When the State used its historic and\n       essential authority to define the marital relation in this way, its role and its power\n       in making the decision enhanced the recognition, dignity, and protection of the\n       class in their own community. DOMA, because of its reach and extent, departs\n       from this history and tradition of reliance on state law to define marriage.\n       “‘[D]iscriminations of an unusual character especially suggest careful\n       consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to the constitutional\n       provision.’”\n\nWindsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2692 (quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at 633). Plaintiffs read these words (and\nothers that follow) as an endorsement of heightened review in today’s case, pointing to the first\ntwo sentences as proof that individual dignity, not federalism, animates Windsor’s holding.\n\n       Yet federalism permeates both parts of this passage and both parts of the opinion.\nWindsor begins by expressing doubts about whether Congress has the delegated power to enact a\nstatute like DOMA at all. But instead of resolving the case on the far-reaching enumerated-\npower ground, it resolves the case on the narrower Romer ground—that anomalous exercises of\npower targeting a single group raise suspicion that bigotry rather than legitimate policy is afoot.\nWhy was DOMA anomalous? Only federalism can supply the answer. The national statute\ntrespassed upon New York’s time-respected authority to define the marital relation, including by\n“enhanc[ing] the recognition, dignity, and protection” of gay and lesbian couples. Id. Today’s\ncase involves no such “divest[ing]”/“depriv[ing]”/“undermin[ing]” of a marriage status granted\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                   Page 33\n\nthrough a State’s authority over domestic relations within its borders and thus provides no basis\nfor inferring that the purpose of the state law was to “impose a disadvantage”/“a separate\nstatus”/“a stigma” on gay couples.

Thornton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117935\"><a href=\"/opinion/117935/us-term-limits-inc-v-thornton/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">779</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 838 (Kennedy, J., concurring),\nthey did so to enhance liberty, not to allow the National Government to divest liberty protections\ngranted by the States in the exercise of their historic and in this instance nearly exclusive power.\nWhat we have here is something entirely different. It is the States doing exactly what every State\nhas been doing for hundreds of years: defining marriage as they see it. The only thing that has\nchanged is the willingness of many States over the last eleven years to expand the definition of\nmarriage to encompass gay couples.\n\n       Any other reading of Windsor would require us to subtract key passages from the opinion\nand add an inverted holding. The Court noted that New York “without doubt” had the power\nunder its traditional authority over marriage to extend the definition of marriage to include gay\ncouples and that Congress had no power to enact “unusual” legislation that interfered with the\nStates’ long-held authority to define marriage. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2692–93. A decision\npremised on heightened scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment that redefined marriage\nnationally to include same-sex couples not only would divest the States of their traditional\nauthority over this issue, but it also would authorize Congress to do something no one would\nhave thought possible a few years ago—to use its Section 5 enforcement powers to add new\ndefinitions and extensions of marriage rights in the years ahead. That would leave the States\nwith little authority to resolve ever-changing debates about how to define marriage (and the\nbenefits and burdens that come with it) outside the beck and call of Congress and the Court.\nHow odd that one branch of the National Government (Congress) would be reprimanded for\nentering the fray in 2013 and two branches of the same Government (the Court and Congress)\nwould take control of the issue a short time later.\n\n       Nor, as the most modest powers of observation attest, is this a setting in which “political\npowerlessness” requires “extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.”\nRodriguez, 411 U.S. at 28.

Throughout that time,\nother advances for the claimants’ cause are manifest. Nationally, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” is\ngone. Locally, the Cincinnati charter amendment that prevented gay individuals from obtaining\ncertain preferences from the city, upheld by our court in 1997, Equality Found. of Greater\nCincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747620\"><a href=\"/opinion/747620/equality-foundation-of-greater-cincinnati-inc-richard-buchanan-chad-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1997), is no more. The Fourteenth\nAmendment does not insulate influential, indeed eminently successful, interest groups from a\ndefining attribute of all democratic initiatives—some succeed, some fail—particularly when\nsucceeding more and failing less are in the offing.\n\n       Why, it is worth asking, the sudden change in public opinion? If there is one thing that\nseems to challenge hearts and minds, even souls, on this issue, it is the transition from the\nabstract to the concrete. If twenty-five percent of the population knew someone who was openly\ngay in 1985, and seventy-five percent knew the same in 2000, Klarman, supra, at 197, it is fair to\nwonder how few individuals still have not been forced to think about the matter through the lens\nof a gay friend or family member. That would be a discrete and insular minority.\n\n       The States’ undoubted power over marriage provides an independent basis for reviewing\nthe laws before us with deference rather than with skepticism. An analogy shows why. When a\nstate law targets noncitizens—a group marked by its lack of political power and its history of\nenduring discrimination—it must in general meet the most demanding of constitutional tests in\norder to survive a skirmish with a court. But when a federal law targets noncitizens, a mere\nrational basis will save it from invalidation.

If all else fails, the plaintiffs invite us to consider that “[a] core\nstrength of the American legal system . . . is its capacity to evolve” in response to new ways of\nthinking about old policies. DeBoer Appellees’ Br. at 57–58. But even if we accept this\ninvitation and put aside the past—original meaning, tradition, time-respected doctrine—that does\nnot take the plaintiffs where they wish to go. We could, to be sure, look at this case alongside\nevolving moral and policy considerations. The Supreme Court has done so before. Lawrence,\n539 U.S. at 573. It may do so again. “A prime part of the history of our Constitution . . . is the\nstory of the extension of constitutional rights . . . to people once ignored or excluded.” United\nStates v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118056\"><a href=\"/opinion/118056/united-states-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557 (1996). Why not do so here?\n\n       Even on this theory, the marriage laws do not violate the Constitution. A principled\njurisprudence of constitutional evolution turns on evolution in society’s values, not evolution in\njudges’ values. Freed of federal-court intervention, thirty-one States would continue to define\nmarriage the old-fashioned way. Lawrence, by contrast, dealt with a situation in which just\nthirteen States continued to prohibit sodomy, and even then most of those laws had fallen into\ndesuetude, rarely being enforced at all. On this record, what right do we have to say that societal\nvalues, as opposed to judicial values, have evolved toward agreement in favor of same-sex\nmarriage?\n\n       The theory of the living constitution rests on the premise that every generation has the\nright to govern itself. If that premise prevents judges from insisting on principles that society has\nmoved past, so too should it prevent judges from anticipating principles that society has yet to\nembrace. It follows that States must enjoy some latitude in matters of timing, for reasonable\npeople can disagree about just when public norms have evolved enough to require a democratic\nresponse. Today’s case captures the point. Not long ago American society took for granted the\nrough correlation between marriage and creation of new life, a vision under which limiting\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 36\n\nmarriage to opposite-sex couples seemed natural. Not long from now, if current trends continue,\nAmerican society may define marriage in terms of affirming mutual love, a vision under which\nthe failure to add loving gay couples seems unfair. Today’s society has begun to move past the\nfirst picture of marriage, but it has not yet developed a consensus on the second.\n\n       If, before a new consensus has emerged on a social issue, federal judges may decide\nwhen the time is ripe to recognize a new constitutional right, surely the people should receive\nsome deference in deciding when the time is ripe to move from one picture of marriage to\nanother. So far, not a single United States Supreme Court Justice in American history has\nwritten an opinion maintaining that the traditional definition of marriage violates the Fourteenth\nAmendment.     No one would accuse the Supreme Court of acting irrationally in failing to\nrecognize a right to same-sex marriage in 2013. Likewise, we should hesitate to accuse the\nStates of acting irrationally in failing to recognize the right in 2004 or 2006 or for that matter\ntoday. Federal judges engaged in the inherent pacing that comes with living constitutionalism\nshould appreciate the inherent pacing that comes with democratic majorities deciding within\nreasonable bounds when and whether to embrace an evolving, as opposed to settled, societal\nnorm. The one form of pacing is akin to the other, making it anomalous for the Court to hold\nthat the States act unconstitutionally when making reasonable pacing decisions of their own.\n\n       From time to time, the Supreme Court has looked beyond our borders in deciding when\nto expand the meaning of constitutional guarantees. Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 576. Yet foreign\npractice only reinforces the impropriety of tinkering with the democratic process in this setting.\nThe great majority of countries across the world—including such progressive democracies as\nAustralia and Finland—still adhere to the traditional definition of marriage. Even more telling,\nthe European Court of Human Rights ruled only a few years ago that European human rights\nlaws do not guarantee a right to same-sex marriage. Schalk & Kopf v. Austria, 2010-IV Eur. Ct.\nH.R. 409. “The area in question,” it explained in words that work just as well on this side of the\nAtlantic, remains “one of evolving rights with no established consensus,” which means that\nStates must “enjoy [discretion] in the timing of the introduction of legislative changes.” Id. at\n438.   It reiterated this conclusion as recently as this July, declaring that “the margin of\nappreciation to be afforded” to States “must still be a wide one.” Hämäläinen v. Finland, No.\n37359/09, HUDOC, at *19 (Eur. Ct. H.R. July 16, 2014). Our Supreme Court relied on the\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 37\n\nEuropean Court’s gay-rights decisions in Lawrence. 539 U.S. at 576. What neutral principle of\nconstitutional interpretation allows us to ignore the European Court’s same-sex marriage\ndecisions when deciding this case? If the point is relevant in the one setting, it is relevant in the\nother, especially in a case designed to treat like matters alike.\n\n       Other practical considerations also do not favor the creation of a new constitutional right\nhere. While these cases present a denial of access to many benefits, what is “[o]f greater\nimportance” to the claimants, as they see it, “is the loss of . . . dignity and respect” occasioned by\nthese laws. Love Appellees’ Br. at 5. No doubt there is much to be said for “dignity and\nrespect” in the eyes of the Constitution and its interpreters. But any loss of dignity and respect\non this issue did not come from the Constitution.            It came from the neighborhoods and\ncommunities in which gay and lesbian couples live, and in which it is worth trying to correct the\nproblem in the first instance—and in that way “to allow the formation of consensus respecting\nthe way the members” of a State “treat each other in their daily contact and constant interaction\nwith each other.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2692.\n\n       For all of the power that comes with the authority to interpret the United States\nConstitution, the federal courts have no long-lasting capacity to change what people think and\nbelieve about new social questions. If the plaintiffs are convinced that litigation is the best way\nto resolve today’s debate and to change heads and hearts in the process, who are we to say?\nPerhaps that is not the only point, however. Yes, we cannot deny thinking the plaintiffs deserve\nbetter—earned victories through initiatives and legislation and the greater acceptance that comes\nwith them. But maybe the American people too deserve better—not just in the sense of having a\nsay through representatives in the legislature rather than through representatives in the courts, but\nalso in the sense of having to come face to face with the issue.               Rights need not be\ncountermajoritarian to count. See, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88352, 78 Stat.\n241. Isn’t the goal to create a culture in which a majority of citizens dignify and respect the\nrights of minority groups through majoritarian laws rather than through decisions issued by a\nmajority of Supreme Court Justices? It is dangerous and demeaning to the citizenry to assume\nthat we, and only we, can fairly understand the arguments for and against gay marriage.\n\n       Last, but not least, federal courts never expand constitutional guarantees in a vacuum.\nWhat one group wants on one issue from the courts today, another group will want on another\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 38\n\nissue tomorrow. The more the Court innovates under the Constitution, the more plausible it is\nfor the Court to do still more—and the more plausible it is for other advocates on behalf of other\nissues to ask the Court to innovate still more.         And while the expansion of liberal and\nconservative constitutional rights will solve, or at least sidestep, the amendment-difficulty\nproblem that confronts many individuals and interest groups, it will exacerbate the judge-\nconfirmation problem. Faith in democracy with respect to issues that the Constitution has not\ncommitted to the courts reinforces a different, more sustainable norm.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       Does the Constitution prohibit a State from denying recognition to same-sex marriages\nconducted in other States? That is the question presented in the two Ohio cases (Obergefell and\nHenry), one of the Kentucky cases (Bourke), and the Tennessee case (Tanco). Our answer to the\nfirst question goes a long way toward answering this one. If it is constitutional for a State to\ndefine marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman, it is also constitutional for the\nState to stand by that definition with respect to couples married in other States or countries.\n\n       The Constitution in general does not delineate when a State must apply its own laws and\nwhen it must apply the laws of another State. Neither any federal statute nor federal common\nlaw fills the gap. Throughout our history, each State has decided for itself how to resolve clashes\nbetween its laws and laws of other sovereigns—giving rise to the field of conflict of laws. The\nStates enjoy wide latitude in fashioning choice-of-law rules. Sun Oil Co. v.

Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110034\"><a href=\"/opinion/110034/nevada-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 422\n(1979). If defining marriage as an opposite-sex relationship amounts to a legitimate public\npolicy—and we have just explained that it does—the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not\nprevent a State from applying that policy to couples who move from one State to another.\n\n       The plaintiffs instead argue that failure to recognize gay marriages celebrated in other\nStates violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. But we do not think that the\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 39\n\ninvocation of these different clauses justifies a different result. As shown, compliance with the\nDue Process and Equal Protection Clauses in this setting requires only a rational relationship\nbetween the legislation and a legitimate public purpose. And a State does not behave irrationally\nby insisting upon its own definition of marriage rather than deferring to the definition adopted by\nanother State. Preservation of a State’s authority to recognize, or to opt not to recognize, an out-\nof-state marriage preserves a State’s sovereign interest in deciding for itself how to define the\nmarital relationship.   It also discourages evasion of the State’s marriage laws by allowing\nindividuals to go to another State, marry there, then return home. Were it irrational for a State to\nadhere to its own policy, what would be the point of the Supreme Court’s repeated holdings that\nthe Full Faith and Credit Clause “does not require a State to apply another State’s law in\nviolation of its own public policy”? Id.\n\n       Far from undermining these points, Windsor reinforces them. The case observes that\n“[t]he definition of marriage is the foundation of the State’s broader authority to regulate the\nsubject of domestic relations with respect to the protection of offspring, property interests, and\nthe enforcement of marital responsibilities.” 133 S. Ct. at 2691 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). How could it be irrational for a State to decide that the foundation of its domestic-\nrelations law will be its definition of marriage, not somebody else’s? Windsor adds that “[e]ach\nstate as a sovereign has a rightful and legitimate concern in the marital status of persons\ndomiciled within its borders.” Id. How could it be irrational for a State to apply its definition of\nmarriage to a couple in whose marital status the State as a sovereign has a rightful and legitimate\nconcern?\n\n       Nor does the policy of nonrecognition trigger Windsor’s (or Romer’s) principle that\nunprecedented exercises of power call for judicial skepticism. States have always decided for\nthemselves when to yield to laws of other States. Exercising this power, States often have\nrefused to enforce all sorts of out-of-state rules on the grounds that they contradict important\nlocal policies. See Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws § 612; Restatement (Second) of\nConflict of Laws § 90. Even more telling, States in many instances have refused to recognize\nmarriages performed in other States on the grounds that these marriages depart from cardinal\nprinciples of the State’s domestic-relations laws. See Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                   Page 40\n\n§ 134; Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 283. The laws challenged here involve\nroutine rather than anomalous uses of state power.\n\n       What of the reality that Ohio recognizes some heterosexual marriages solemnized in\nother States even if those marriages could not be performed in Ohio? See, e.g., Mazzolini v.\nMazzolini, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 208 (Ohio 1958). The only reason Ohio could have for banning\nrecognition of same-sex marriages performed elsewhere and not prohibiting heterosexual\nmarriages performed elsewhere, the Ohio plaintiffs claim, is animus or “discrimination[] of an\nunusual character.” Obergefell Appellees’ Br. at 18 (quoting Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2692).\n\n       But, in making this argument, the plaintiffs misapprehend Ohio law, wrongly assuming\nthat Ohio would recognize as valid any heterosexual marriage that was valid in the State that\nsanctioned it. That is not the case. Ohio law recognizes some out-of-state marriages that could\nnot be performed in Ohio, but not all such marriages. See, e.g., Mazzolini, 155 N.E.2d at 208\n(marriage of first cousins); Hardin v. Davis, 16 Ohio Supp. 19, 20 (Ohio Ct. Com. Pl. 1945)\n(marriage by proxy). In Mazzolini, the most relevant precedent, the Ohio Supreme Court stated\nthat a number of heterosexual marriages—ones that were “incestuous, polygamous, shocking to\ngood morals, unalterably opposed to a well defined public policy, or prohibited”—would not be\nrecognized in the State, even if they were valid in the jurisdiction that performed them.\n155 N.E.2d at 208–09 (noting that first-cousin marriages fell outside this rule because they were\n“not made void by explicit provision” and “not incestuous”). Ohio law declares same-sex\nmarriage contrary to the State’s public policy, placing those marriages within the longstanding\nexception to Ohio’s recognition rule. See Ohio Rev. Code § 3101.01(C).\n\n                                                IV.\n\n       That leaves one more claim, premised on the constitutional right to travel.           In the\nTennessee case (Tanco) and one of the Ohio cases (Henry), the claimants maintain that a State’s\nrefusal to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages illegitimately burdens the right to travel—in\nthe one case by penalizing couples who move into the State by refusing to recognize their\nmarriages, in the other by preventing their child from obtaining a passport because the State\nrefused to provide a birth certificate that included the names of both parents.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 41\n\n        The United States Constitution does not mention a right to travel by name. “Yet the\nconstitutional right to travel from one State to another is firmly embedded in our jurisprudence.”\nSaenz v. Roe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118286\"><a href=\"/opinion/118286/saenz-v-roe/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 498 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). It provides three\nguarantees: (1) “the right of a citizen of one State to enter and to leave another State”; (2) “the\nright to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien” when visiting a second\nState; and (3) the right of new permanent residents “to be treated like other citizens of that\nState.” Id. at 500.\n\n        Tennessee’s nonrecognition law does not violate these prohibitions. It does not ban, or\nfor that matter regulate, movement into or out of the State other than in the respect all regulations\ncreate incentives or disincentives to live in one place or another. Most critically, the law does\nnot punish out-of-state new residents in relation to its own born and bred. Nonresidents are\n“treated” just “like other citizens of that State,” id., because the State has not expanded the\ndefinition of marriage to include gay couples in all settings, whether the individuals just arrived\nin Tennessee or descend from Andrew Jackson.\n\n        The same is true for the Ohio law. No regulation of movement or differential treatment\nbetween the newly resident and the longstanding resident occurs. All Ohioans must follow the\nState’s definition of marriage. With respect to the need to obtain an Ohio birth certificate before\nobtaining a passport, they can get one. The certificate just will not include both names of the\ncouple. The “just” of course goes to the heart of the matter. In that respect, however, it is due\nprocess and equal protection, not the right to travel, that govern the issue.\n\n                                                ***\n\n        This case ultimately presents two ways to think about change. One is whether the\nSupreme Court will constitutionalize a new definition of marriage to meet new policy views\nabout the issue. The other is whether the Court will begin to undertake a different form of\nchange—change in the way we as a country optimize the handling of efforts to address requests\nfor new civil liberties.\n\n        If the Court takes the first approach, it may resolve the issue for good and give the\nplaintiffs and many others relief. But we will never know what might have been. If the Court\ntakes the second approach, is it not possible that the traditional arbiters of change—the people—\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 42\n\nwill meet today’s challenge admirably and settle the issue in a productive way? In just eleven\nyears, nineteen States and a conspicuous District, accounting for nearly forty-five percent of the\npopulation, have exercised their sovereign powers to expand a definition of marriage that until\nrecently was universally followed going back to the earliest days of human history. That is a\ndifficult timeline to criticize as unworthy of further debate and voting. When the courts do not\nlet the people resolve new social issues like this one, they perpetuate the idea that the heroes in\nthese change events are judges and lawyers. Better in this instance, we think, to allow change\nthrough the customary political processes, in which the people, gay and straight alike, become\nthe heroes of their own stories by meeting each other not as adversaries in a court system but as\nfellow citizens seeking to resolve a new social issue in a fair-minded way.\n\n       For these reasons, we reverse.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v.

But as an appellate court decision, it\nwholly fails to grapple with the relevant constitutional question in this appeal: whether a state’s\nconstitutional prohibition of same-sex marriage violates equal protection under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Instead, the majority sets up a false premise—that the question before us is “who\nshould decide?”—and leads us through a largely irrelevant discourse on democracy and\nfederalism. In point of fact, the real issue before us concerns what is at stake in these six cases\nfor the individual plaintiffs and their children, and what should be done about it. Because I reject\nthe majority’s resolution of these questions based on its invocation of vox populi and its\nreverence for “proceeding with caution” (otherwise known as the “wait and see” approach), I\ndissent.\n\n       In the main, the majority treats both the issues and the litigants here as mere abstractions.\nInstead of recognizing the plaintiffs as persons, suffering actual harm as a result of being denied\nthe right to marry where they reside or the right to have their valid marriages recognized there,\nmy colleagues view the plaintiffs as social activists who have somehow stumbled into federal\ncourt, inadvisably, when they should be out campaigning to win “the hearts and minds” of\nMichigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee voters to their cause. But these plaintiffs are not\npolitical zealots trying to push reform on their fellow citizens; they are committed same-sex\ncouples, many of them heading up de facto families, who want to achieve equal status—de jure\nstatus, if you will—with their married neighbors, friends, and coworkers, to be accepted as\ncontributing members of their social and religious communities, and to be welcomed as fully\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818               DeBoer v.

But at a\ndeeper level, . . . they are about the welfare of American children.”), must have said to\nthemselves at various points in the majority opinion, “But what about the children?” I did, and I\ncould not find the answer in the opinion. For although my colleagues in the majority pay lip\nservice to marriage as an institution conceived for the purpose of providing a stable family unit\n“within which children may flourish,” they ignore the destabilizing effect of its absence in the\nhomes of tens of thousands of same-sex parents throughout the four states of the Sixth Circuit.\n\n        Indeed, with the exception of Ohio, the defendants in each of these cases—the\nproponents of their respective “defense of marriage” amendments—spent virtually their entire\noral arguments professing what has come to be known as the “irresponsible procreation” theory:\nthat limiting marriage and its benefits to opposite-sex couples is rational, even necessary, to\nprovide for “unintended offspring” by channeling their biological procreators into the bonds of\nmatrimony. When we asked counsel why that goal required the simultaneous exclusion of same-\nsex couples from marrying, we were told that permitting same-sex marriage might denigrate the\ninstitution of marriage in the eyes of opposite-sex couples who conceive out of wedlock, causing\nsubsequent abandonment of the unintended offspring by one or both biological parents. We also\nwere informed that because same-sex couples cannot themselves produce wanted or unwanted\noffspring, and because they must therefore look to non-biological means of parenting that require\nplanning and expense, stability in a family unit headed by same-sex parents is assured without\nthe benefit of formal matrimony. But, as the court in Baskin pointed out, many “abandoned\nchildren [born out of wedlock to biological parents] are adopted by homosexual couples, and\n\n        1\n          See, e.g., Loving v.

How ironic that irresponsible, unmarried, opposite-sex couples in the Sixth\nCircuit who produce unwanted offspring must be “channeled” into marriage and thus rewarded\nwith its many psychological and financial benefits, while same-sex couples who become model\nparents are punished for their responsible behavior by being denied the right to marry. As an\nobviously exasperated Judge Posner responded after puzzling over this same paradox in Baskin,\n“Go figure.” Id. at 662.\n\n       In addressing the “irresponsible procreation” argument that has been referenced by\nvirtually every state defendant in litigation similar to this case, the Baskin court noted that\nestimates put the number of American children being raised by same-sex parents at over\n200,000. Id. at 663. “Unintentional offspring are the children most likely to be put up for\nadoption,” id. at 662, and because statistics show that same-sex couples are many times more\nlikely to adopt than opposite-sex couples, “same-sex marriage improves the prospects of\nunintended children by increasing the number and resources of prospective adopters.” Id. at 663.\nMoreover, “[i]f marriage is better for children who are being brought up by their biological\nparents, it must be better for children who are being brought up by their adoptive parents.” Id. at\n664.\n\n       The concern for the welfare of children that echoes throughout the Baskin opinion can be\ntraced in part to the earlier opinion in Windsor, in which the Supreme Court struck down, as\nunconstitutional on equal-protection grounds, section 3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act\n(DOMA), which defined the term “marriage” for federal purposes as “mean[ing] only a legal\nunion between one man and one woman as husband and wife,” and the term “spouse” as\n“refer[ring] only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.” Id. at 2683 (citing\n1 U.S.C. § 7). Although DOMA did not affect the prerogative of the states to regulate marriage\nwithin their respective jurisdictions, it did deprive same-sex couples whose marriages were\nconsidered valid under state law of myriad federal benefits. As Justice Kennedy, writing for the\nmajority, pointed out:\n\n       DOMA’s principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and\n       make them unequal. The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other\n       reasons like governmental efficiency . . . .

And it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being\n       raised by same-sex couples. The law in question makes it even more difficult for\n       the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its\n       concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.\n\nId. at 2694.\n\n       Looking more closely at the situation of just one of the same-sex couples from the six\ncases before us brings Justice Kennedy’s words on paper to life. Two of the Michigan plaintiffs,\nApril DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, are unmarried, same-sex partners who have lived as a couple for\neight years in a home they own together. They are both trained and employed as nurses, DeBoer\nin a hospital neonatal department and Rowse in an emergency department at another hospital.\nTogether they are rearing three children but, due to existing provisions in Michigan’s adoption\nlaws, DeBoer and Rowse are prohibited from adopting the children as joint parents because they\nare unmarried. Instead, Rowse alone adopted two children, who are identified in the record as N\nand J. DeBoer adopted the third child, who is identified as R.\n\n       All three children had difficult starts in life, and two of them are now characterized as\n“special needs” children. N was born on January 25, 2009, to a biological mother who was\nhomeless, had psychological impairments, was unable to care for N, and subsequently\nsurrendered her legal rights to N. The plaintiffs volunteered to care for the boy and brought him\ninto their home following his birth. In November 2009, Rowse completed the necessary steps to\nadopt N legally.\n\n       Rowse also legally adopted J after the boy’s foster care agency asked Rowse and DeBoer\ninitially to serve as foster parents and legal guardians for him, despite the uphill climb the baby\nfaced. According to the plaintiffs’ amended complaint:\n\n       J was born on November 9, 2009, at Hutzel Hospital, premature at 25 weeks, to a\n       drug addicted prostitute. Upon birth, he weighed 1 pound, 9 ounces and tested\n       positive for marijuana, cocaine, opiates and methadone. His birth mother\n       abandoned him immediately after delivery. J remained in the hospital in the\n       NICU for four months with myriad different health complications, and was not\n       expected to live. If he survived, he was not expected to be able to walk, speak or\n       function on a normal level in any capacity. . . . With Rowse and DeBoer’s\n       constant care and medical attention, many of J’s physical conditions have\n       resolved.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 47\n\n       The third adopted child, R, was born on February 1, 2010, to a 19-year-old girl who\nreceived no prenatal care and who gave birth at her mother’s home before bringing the infant to\nthe hospital where plaintiff DeBoer worked. R continues to experience issues related to her lack\nof prenatal care, including delayed gross motor skills. She is in a physical-therapy program to\naddress these problems.\n\n       Both DeBoer and Rowse share in the responsibilities of raising the two four-year-olds\nand the five-year-old.    The plaintiffs even have gone so far as to “coordinate their work\nschedules so that at least one parent is generally home with the children” to attend to their\nmedical needs and perform other parental duties. Given the close-knit, loving environment\nshared by the plaintiffs and the children, DeBoer wishes to adopt N and J legally as a second\nparent, and Rowse wishes to adopt R legally as her second parent.\n\n       Although Michigan statutes allow married couples and single persons to adopt, those\nlaws preclude unmarried couples from adopting each other’s children. As a result, DeBoer and\nRowse filed suit in federal district court challenging the Michigan adoption statute, Michigan\nCompiled Laws § 710.24, on federal equal-protection grounds.           They later amended their\ncomplaint to include a challenge to the so-called Michigan Marriage Amendment, see Mich.\nConst. art. I, § 25, added to the Michigan state constitution in 2004, after the district court\nsuggested that the plaintiffs’ “injury was not traceable to the defendants’ enforcement of section\n[710.24]” but, rather, flowed from the fact that the plaintiffs “were not married, and any legal\nform of same-sex union is prohibited” in Michigan. The case went to trial on the narrow legal\nissue of whether the amendment could survive rational basis review, i.e., whether it proscribes\nconduct in a manner that is rationally related to any conceivable legitimate governmental\npurpose.\n\n       The bench trial lasted for eight days and consisted of testimony from sociologists,\neconomists, law professors, a psychologist, a historian, a demographer, and a county clerk.\nIncluded in the plaintiffs’ presentation of evidence were statistics regarding the number of\nchildren in foster care or awaiting adoption, as well as testimony regarding the difficulties facing\nsame-sex partners attempting to retain parental influence over children adopted in Michigan.\nGary Gates, a demographer, and Vivek Sankaran, the director of both the Child Advocacy Law\nClinic and the Child Welfare Appellate Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School,\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 48\n\ntogether offered testimony painting a grim picture of the plight of foster children and orphans in\nthe state of Michigan. For example, Sankaran noted that just under 14,000 foster children reside\nin Michigan, with approximately 3,500 of those being legal orphans. Nevertheless, same-sex\ncouples in the state are not permitted to adopt such children as a couple. Even though one person\ncan legally adopt a child, should anything happen to that adoptive parent, there is no provision in\nMichigan’s legal framework that would “ensure that the children would necessarily remain with\nthe surviving non-legal parent,” even if that parent went through the arduous, time-consuming,\nexpensive adoption-approval process. Thus, although the State of Michigan would save money\nby moving children from foster care or state care into adoptive families, and although same-sex\ncouples in Michigan are almost three times more likely than opposite-sex couples to be raising\nan adopted child and twice as likely to be fostering a child, there remains a legal disincentive for\nsame-sex couples to adopt children there.\n\n       David Brodzinsky, a developmental and clinical psychologist, for many years on the\nfaculty at Rutgers University, reiterated the testimony that Michigan’s ban on adoptions by\nsame-sex couples increases the potential risks to children awaiting adoptions. The remainder of\nhis testimony was devoted to a systematic, statistic-based debunking of studies intimating that\nchildren raised in gay or lesbian families, ipso facto, are less well-adjusted than children raised\nby heterosexual couples. Brodzinsky conceded that marriage brings societal legitimatization and\nstability to children but noted that he found no statistically significant differences in general\ncharacteristics or in development between children raised in same-sex households and children\nraised in opposite-sex households, and that the psychological well-being, educational\ndevelopment, and peer relationships were the same in children raised in gay, lesbian, or\nheterosexual homes.\n\n       Such findings led Brodzinsky to conclude that the gender of a parent is far less important\nthan the quality of the parenting offered and that family processes and resources are far better\npredictors of child adjustment than the family structure.         He testified that those studies\npresuming to show that children raised in gay and lesbian families exhibited more adjustment\nproblems and decreased educational achievement were seriously flawed, simply because they\nrelied on statistics concerning children who had come from families experiencing a prior\ntraumatic breakup of a failed heterosexual relationship. In fact, when focusing upon children of\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 49\n\nlesbian families created through donor insemination, Brodzinsky found no differences in\ncomparison with children from donor insemination in heterosexual families or in comparison\nwith children conceived naturally in heterosexual families. According to Brodzinsky, such a\nfinding was not surprising given the fact that all such children experienced no family disruption\nin their past. For the same reason, few differences were noted in studies of children adopted at a\nvery early age by same-sex couples and children naturally born into heterosexual families.\n       Nancy Cott, a professor of history at Harvard University, the director of graduate studies\nthere, and the author of Public Vows: A History of Marriage and the Nation, also testified on\nbehalf of the plaintiffs. She explained how the concept of marriage and the roles of the marriage\npartners have changed over time. As summarized by Cott, the wife’s identity is no longer\nsubsumed into that of her husband, interracial marriages are legal now that the antiquated, racist\nconcept of preserving the purity of the white race has fallen into its rightful place of dishonor,\nand traditional gender-assigned roles are no longer standard. Cott also testified that solemnizing\nmarriages between same-sex partners would create tangible benefits for Michigan citizens\nbecause spouses would then be allowed to inherit without taxation and would be able to receive\nretirement, Social Security, and veteran’s benefits upon the death of an eligible spouse.\nMoreover, statistics make clear that heterosexual marriages have not suffered or decreased in\nnumber as a result of states permitting same-sex marriages. In fact, to the contrary, Cott noted\nthat there exists some evidence that many young people now refuse to enter into heterosexual\nmarriages until their gay or lesbian friends can also enjoy the legitimacy of state-backed\nmarriages.\n\n       Michael Rosenfeld, a Stanford University sociologist, testified about studies he had\nundertaken that confirmed the hypothesis that legitimation of same-sex relationships promotes\ntheir stability. Specifically, Rosenfeld’s research established that although same-sex couples\nliving in states without recognition of their commitments to each other did have a higher break-\nup rate than heterosexual married couples, the break-up rates of opposite-sex married couples\nand same-sex couples in recognized civil unions were virtually identical. Similarly, the break-up\nrates of same-sex couples not living in a state-recognized relationship approximated the break-up\nrate of heterosexual couples cohabiting without marriage.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                    Page 50\n\n       Rosenfeld also criticized the methodology of studies advanced by the defendants that\ndisagreed with his conclusions. According to Rosenfeld, those critical studies failed to take into\naccount the stability or lack of stability of the various groups examined. For example, he\ntestified that one such study compared children who had experienced no adverse family\ntransitions with children who had lived through many such traumatic family changes. Not\nsurprisingly, children from broken homes with lower-income-earning parents who had less\neducation and lived in urban areas performed more poorly in school than other children.\nAccording to Rosenfeld, arguments to the contrary that failed to control for such differences,\ntaken to their extreme, would lead to the conclusion that only high-income individuals of Asian\ndescent who earned advanced degrees and lived in suburban areas should be allowed to marry.\n\n       To counteract the testimony offered by the plaintiffs’ witnesses, the defendants presented\nas witnesses the authors or co-authors of three studies that disagreed with the conclusions\nreached by the plaintiffs’ experts. All three studies, however, were given little credence by the\ndistrict court because of inherent flaws in the methods used or the intent of the authors. For\nexample, the New Family Structures Study reported by Mark Regnerus, a sociologist at the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, admittedly relied upon interviews of children from gay or lesbian\nfamilies who were products of broken heterosexual unions in order to support a conclusion that\nliving with such gay or lesbian families adversely affected the development of the children.\nRegnerus conceded, moreover, that his own department took the highly unusual step of issuing\nthe following statement on the university website in response to the release of the study:\n\n       [Dr. Regnerus’s opinions] do not reflect the views of the sociology department of\n       the University of Texas at Austin. Nor do they reflect the views of the American\n       Sociological Association which takes the position that the conclusions he draws\n       from his study of gay parenting are fundamentally flawed on conceptual and\n       methodological grounds and that the findings from Dr. Regnerus’[s] work have\n       been cited inappropriately in efforts to diminish the civil rights and legitimacy of\n       LBGTQ partners and their families.\n\nIn fact, the record before the district court reflected clearly that Regnerus’s study had been\nfunded by the Witherspoon Institute, a conservative “think tank” opposed to same-sex marriage,\nin order to vindicate “the traditional understanding of marriage.”\n\n       Douglas Allen, the co-author of another study with Catherine Pakaluk and Joe Price,\ntestified that children raised by same-sex couples graduated from high school at a significantly\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818              DeBoer v. Snyder                          Page 51\n\nlower rate than did children raised by heterosexual married couples. On cross-examination,\nhowever, Allen conceded that “many of those children who . . . were living in same-sex\nhouseholds had previously lived in an opposite sex household where their parents had divorced,\nbroken up, some kind of separation or transition.” Furthermore, Allen provided evidence of the\nbias inherent in his study by admitting that he believed that engaging in homosexual acts “means\neternal separation from God, in other words[,] going to hell.”\n\n        The final study advanced by the defendants was conducted by Loren Marks, a professor\nin human ecology at Louisiana State University, in what was admittedly an effort to counteract\nthe “groupthink” portrayed by perceived “liberal psychologists.” But although Marks criticized\nwhat he perceived to be “a pronounced liberal lean on social issues” by many psychologists, he\nrevealed his own bias by acknowledging that he was a lay clergyman in the Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter Day Saints (LDS) and that the LDS directive “for a couple to be married by\nGod’s authority in God’s house, the holy temple, and then to have children per the teaching that\nGod’s commandment for his children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force.”\n\n        Presented with the admitted biases and methodological shortcomings prevalent in the\nstudies performed by the defendant’s experts, the district court found those witnesses “largely\nunbelievable” and not credible. DeBoer v. Snyder, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 768 (E.D. Mich. 2014).\nProceeding to a legal analysis of the core issue in the litigation, the district court then concluded\nthat the proscriptions of the marriage amendment are not rationally related to any legitimate state\ninterest. Addressing the defendants’ three asserted rational bases for the amendment,2 the district\ncourt found each such proffered justification without merit.\n\n        Principally, the court determined that the amendment is in no way related to the asserted\nstate interest in ensuring an optimal environment for child-rearing. The testimony adduced at\ntrial clearly refuted the proposition that, all things being equal, same-sex couples are less able to\nprovide for the welfare and development of children. Indeed, marriage, whether between same-\nsex or opposite-sex partners, increases stability within the family unit. By permitting same-sex\n\n\n        2\n          In the district court, the state did not advance an “unintended pregnancy” argument, nor was that claim\nincluded in the state’s brief on appeal, although counsel did mention it during oral argument. In terms of “optimal\nenvironment,” the state emphasized the need for children to have “both a mom and a dad,” because “men and\nwomen are different,” and to have a “biological connection to their parents.”\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v. Snyder                     Page 52\n\ncouples to marry, that stability would not be threatened by the death of one of the parents. Even\nmore damning to the defendants’ position, however, is the fact that the State of Michigan allows\nheterosexual couples to marry even if the couple does not wish to have children, even if the\ncouple does not have sufficient resources or education to care for children, even if the parents are\npedophiles or child abusers, and even if the parents are drug addicts.\n\n        Furthermore, the district court found no reason to believe that the amendment furthers the\nasserted state interests in “proceeding with caution” before “altering the traditional definition of\nmarriage” or in “upholding tradition and morality.” As recognized by the district court, there is\nno legitimate justification for delay when constitutional rights are at issue, and even adherence to\nreligious views or tradition cannot serve to strip citizens of their right to the guarantee of equal\nprotection under the law.\n\n        Finally, and relatedly, the district court acknowledged that the regulation of marriage\ntraditionally has been seen as part of a state’s police power but concluded that this fact cannot\nserve as an excuse to ignore the constitutional rights of individual citizens. Were it otherwise,\nthe court observed, the prohibition in Virginia and in many other states against miscegenation\nstill would be in effect today. Because the district court found that “regardless of whoever finds\nfavor in the eyes of the most recent majority, the guarantee of equal protection must prevail,” the\ncourt held the amendment and its implementing statutes “unconstitutional because they violate\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.”\nId. at 775.\n\n        If I were in the majority here, I would have no difficulty in affirming the district court's\nopinion in DeBoer. The record is rich with evidence that, as a pragmatic matter, completely\nrefutes the state’s effort to defend the ban against same-sex marriage that is inherent in the\nmarriage amendment. Moreover, the district court did a masterful job of supporting its legal\nconclusions. Upholding the decision would also control the resolution of the other five cases that\nwere consolidated for purposes of this appeal.\n\n        Is a thorough explication of the legal basis for such a result appropriate? It is, of course.\nIs it necessary? In my judgment, it is not, given the excellent—even eloquent—opinion in\nDeBoer and in the opinions that have come from four other circuits in the last few months that\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818                 DeBoer v.

The Tenth Circuit also found that the Utah laws violated equal protection, applying\nstrict scrutiny because the classification in question impinged on a fundamental right. In doing\nso, the court rejected the state’s reliance on various justifications offered to establish a\ncompelling state interest in denying marriage to same-sex couples, finding “an insufficient\ncausal connection” between the prohibition on same-sex marriage and the state’s “articulated\ngoals,” which included a purported interest in fostering biological reproduction, encouraging\noptimal childrearing, and maintaining gendered parenting styles.

Id. at 1227.\n\n       The Fourth Circuit in Bostic also applied strict scrutiny to strike down Virginia’s same-\nsex-marriage prohibitions as infringing on a fundamental right, citing Loving and observing that\n“[o]ver the decades, the Supreme Court has demonstrated that the right to marry is an expansive\nliberty interest that may stretch to accommodate changing societal norms.” 760 F.3d at 376. In a\nthoughtful opinion, the court analyzed each of the state’s proffered interests: maintaining control\nof the “definition of marriage,” adhering to the “tradition of opposite-sex marriage,” “protecting\nthe institution of marriage,” “encouraging responsible procreation,” and “promoting the optimal\nchildrearing environment.” Id. at 378. In each instance, the court found that there was no link\nbetween the state’s purported “compelling interest” and the exclusion of same-sex couples “from\nparticipating fully in our society, which is precisely the type of segregation that the Fourteenth\nAmendment cannot countenance.” Id. at 384. As to the state’s interest in federalism, the court\npointed to the long-recognized principle that “[s]tate laws defining and regulating marriage, of\ncourse, must respect the constitutional rights of persons,” id. at 379 (quoting Windsor, 133 S. Ct.\nat 2691), and highlighted Windsor’s reiteration of “Loving’s admonition that the states must\nexercise their authority without trampling constitutional guarantees.” Id. Addressing the state’s\ncontention that marriage under state law should be confined to opposite-sex couples because\nunintended pregnancies cannot result from same-sex unions, the court noted that “[b]ecause\nsame-sex couples and infertile opposite-sex couples are similarly situated, the Equal Protection\nClause counsels against treating these groups differently.” Id. at 381-82 (citing City of Cleburne\nv.

But the court also found that “discrimination\nagainst same-sex couples is irrational, and therefore unconstitutional even if the discrimination is\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                   Page 55\n\nnot subjected to heightened scrutiny.” Id. at 656. This conclusion was based on the court’s\nrejection of “the only rationale that the states put forth with any conviction—that same-sex\ncouples and their children don't need marriage because same-sex couples can't produce children,\nintended or unintended,” an argument “so full of holes that it cannot be taken seriously.” Id.\n(emphasis in original).      The court therefore found it unnecessary to engage in “the more\ncomplex analysis found in more closely balanced equal-protection cases” or under the due\nprocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id. at 656-57.\n\n       The Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Latta also focuses on equal-protection principles in\nfinding that Idaho’s and Nevada’s statutes and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex\nmarriage violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the Ninth Circuit had recently held in\nSmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Labs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481 (9th Cir. 2014), that\nclassifications based on sexual orientation are subject to heightened scrutiny, a conclusion the\ncourt drew from its reading of Windsor to require assessment more rigorous than rational-basis\nreview, the path to finding an equal-protection violation was less than arduous. As did the Tenth\nCircuit in Kitchen, the court in Latta found it “wholly illogical” to think that same-sex marriage\nwould affect opposite-sex couples’ choices with regard to procreation.           Latta, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">4977682</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *5 (citing Kitchen, 755 F.3d at 1223).\n\n       These four cases from our sister circuits provide a rich mine of responses to every\nrationale raised by the defendants in the Sixth Circuit cases as a basis for excluding same-sex\ncouples from contracting valid marriages. Indeed, it would seem unnecessary for this court to do\nmore than cite those cases in affirming the district courts’ decisions in the six cases now before\nus. Because the correct result is so obvious, one is tempted to speculate that the majority has\npurposefully taken the contrary position to create the circuit split regarding the legality of same-\nsex marriage that could prompt a grant of certiorari by the Supreme Court and an end to the\nuncertainty of status and the interstate chaos that the current discrepancy in state laws threatens.\nPerhaps that is the case, but it does not relieve the dissenting member of the panel from the\nobligation of a rejoinder.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818              DeBoer v.

It lacks only a stake through its heart.\nNevertheless, the majority posits that we are bound by the Court’s aging one-line order denying\nreview of an appeal from the Minnesota Supreme Court “for want of a substantial federal\nquestion.” As the majority notes, the question concerned the state’s refusal to issue a marriage\nlicense to a same-sex couple, but the decision came at a point in time when sodomy was legal in\nonly one state in the country, Illinois, which had repealed its anti-sodomy statute in 1962. The\nMinnesota statute criminalizing same-sex intimate relations was not struck down until 2001,\nalmost 30 years after Baker was announced.4 The Minnesota Supreme Court’s denial of relief to\na same-sex couple in 1971 and the United States Supreme Court’s conclusion that there was no\nsubstantial federal question involved in the appeal thus is unsurprising. As the majority notes—\nnot facetiously, one hopes—“that was then; this is now.”\n\n        At the same time, the majority argues that we are bound by the eleven words in the order,\ndespite the Supreme Court silence on the matter in the 42 years since it was issued.

There is not now and\nnever has been a universally accepted definition of marriage. In early Judeo-Christian law and\nthroughout the West in the Middle Ages, marriage was a religious obligation, not a civil status.\nHistorically, it has been pursued primarily as a political or economic arrangement. Even today,\npolygynous marriages outnumber monogamous ones—the practice is widespread in Africa, Asia,\nand the Middle East, especially in countries following Islamic law, which also recognizes\ntemporary marriages in some parts of the world. In Asia and the Middle East, many marriages\nare still arranged and some are even coerced.\n\n       Although some of the older statutes regarding marriage cited by the majority do speak of\nthe union of “a man and a woman,” the picture hardly ends there. When Justice Alito noted in\nWindsor that the opponents of DOMA were “implicitly ask[ing] us to endorse [a more expansive\ndefinition of marriage and] to reject the traditional view,” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2718 (Alito, J.,\ndissenting), he may have been unfamiliar with all that the “traditional view” entailed, especially\nfor women who were subjected to coverture as a result of Anglo-American common law.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v.

The law of\n       coverture, for example, deemed the “the husband and wife . . . one person,” such\n       that “the very being or legal existence of the woman [was] suspended . . . or at\n       least [was] incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband” during the\n       marriage. 1 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 441 (3d\n       rev. ed. 1884).

That is why “married women\n       traditionally were denied the legal capacity to hold or convey property . . . .”\n       Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 685. Notably, husbands owed their wives support even if\n       there were no children of the marriage. See, e.g., Hendrik Hartog, Man and Wife\n       in America: A History 156 (2000).\n       There was also a significant disparity between the rights of husbands and wives\n       with regard to physical intimacy. At common law, “a woman was the sexual\n       property of her husband; that is, she had a duty to have intercourse with him.”\n       John D’Emilio & Estelle B. Freedman, Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in\n       America 79 (3d ed. 2012). Quite literally, a wife was legally “the possession of\n       her husband, . . . [her] husband’s property.” Hartog, Man and Wife in America, at\n       137. Accordingly, a husband could sue his wife’s lover in tort for “entic[ing]” her\n       or “alienat[ing]” her affections and thereby interfering with his property rights in\n       her body and her labor. Id. A husband’s possessory interest in his wife was\n       undoubtedly also driven by the fact that, historically, marriage was the only legal\n       site for licit sex; sex outside of marriage was almost universally criminalized. See,\n       e.g., Ariela R. Dubler, Immoral Purposes: Marriage and the Genus of Illicit Sex,\n       115 Yale L.J. 756, 763–64 (2006).\n       Notably, although sex was strongly presumed to be an essential part of marriage,\n       the ability to procreate was generally not. See, e.g., Chester Vernier, American\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818      DeBoer v.

Men could not be prosecuted for spousal rape. A husband’s “incapacity” to\n       rape his wife was justified by the theory that “‘the marriage constitute[d] a\n       blanket consent to sexual intimacy which the woman [could] revoke only by\n       dissolving the marital relationship.’” See, e.g., Jill Elaine Hasday, Contest and\n       Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape, 88 Calif. L. Rev 1373, 1376 n.9\n       (2000) (quoting Model Penal Code and Commentaries, § 213.1 cmt. 8(c), at 342\n       (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1980)).\n       Concomitantly, dissolving the marital partnership via divorce was exceedingly\n       difficult. Through the mid-twentieth century, divorce could be obtained only on a\n       limited set of grounds, if at all. At the beginning of our nation’s history, several\n       states did not permit full divorce except under the narrowest of circumstances;\n       separation alone was the remedy, even if a woman could show “cruelty\n       endangering life or limb.” Peter W. Bardaglio, Reconstructing the Household:\n       Families, Sex, and the Law in the Nineteenth-Century South 33 (1995); see also\n       id. 32–33. In part, this policy dovetailed with the grim fact that, at English\n       common law, and in several states through the beginning of the nineteenth\n       century, “a husband’s prerogative to chastise his wife”—that is, to beat her short\n       of permanent injury—was recognized as his marital right. Reva B. Siegel, “The\n       Rule of Love”: Wife Beating as Prerogative and Privacy, 105 Yale L.J. 2117,\n       2125 (1996).\n\nId. at *20-21.\n\n       Women were not the only class deprived of equal status in “traditional marriage.” Until\nthe end of the Civil War in 1865, slaves were prohibited from contracting legal marriages and\noften resorted to “jumping the broomstick” to mark a monogamous conjugal relationship.\nInformal “slave marriage” was the rule until the end of the war, when Freedmen’s Bureaus began\nissuing marriage licenses to former slaves who could establish the existence of long-standing\nfamily relationships, despite the fact that family members were sometimes at great distances\nfrom one another. The ritual of jumping the broomstick, thought of in this country in terms of\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                  Page 60\n\nslave marriages, actually originated in England, where civil marriages were not available until\nenactment of the Marriage Act of 1837. Prior to that, the performance of valid marriages was the\nsole prerogative of the Church of England, unless the participants were Quakers or Jews. The\nmajority’s admiration for “traditional marriage” thus seems misplaced, if not naïve. The legal\nstatus has been through so many reforms that the marriage of same-sex couples constitutes\nmerely the latest wave in a vast sea of change.\n\nRational-Basis Review.\n\n       The principal thrust of the majority’s rational-basis analysis is basically a reiteration of\nthe same tired argument that the proponents of same-sex-marriage bans have raised in litigation\nacross the country: marriage is about the regulation of “procreative urges” of men and women\nwho therefore do not need the “government’s encouragement to have sex” but, instead, need\nencouragement to “create and maintain stable relationships within which children may flourish.”\nThe majority contends that exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage must be considered\nrational based on “the biological reality that couples of the same sex do not have children in the\nsame way as couples of opposite sexes and that couples of the same sex do not run the risk of\nunintended children.” As previously noted, however, this argument is one that an eminent jurist\nhas described as being “so full of holes that it cannot be taken seriously.” Baskin, 766 F.3d at\n656 (Posner, J.).\n\n       At least my colleagues are perceptive enough to acknowledge that “[g]ay couples, no less\nthan straight couples, are capable of sharing such relationships . . . [and] are capable of raising\nstable families.” The majority is even persuaded that the “quality of [same-sex] relationships,\nand the capacity to raise children within them, turns not on sexual orientation but on individual\nchoices and individual commitment.” All of which, the majority surmises, “supports the policy\nargument made by many that marriage laws should be extended to gay couples.” But this\nconclusion begs the question: why reverse the judgments of four federal district courts, in four\ndifferent states, and in six different cases that would do just that?\n\n       There are apparently two answers; first, “let the people decide” and, second, “give it\ntime.” The majority posits that “just as [same-sex marriage has been adopted in] nineteen states\nand the District of Columbia,” the change-agents in the Sixth Circuit should be “elected\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818              DeBoer v. Snyder                          Page 61\n\nlegislators, not life-tenured judges.”           Of course, this argument fails to acknowledge the\nimpracticalities involved in amending, re-amending, or un-amending a state constitution.6 More\nto the point, under our constitutional system, the courts are assigned the responsibility of\ndetermining individual rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, regardless of popular opinion or\neven a plebiscite. As the Supreme Court has noted, “It is plain that the electorate as a whole,\nwhether by referendum or otherwise, could not order [government] action violative of the Equal\nProtection Clause, and the [government] may not avoid the strictures of that Clause by deferring\nto the wishes or objections of some fraction of the body politic.” City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at\n448 (internal citation omitted).\n\n        Moreover, as it turns out, legalization of same-sex marriage in the “nineteen states and\nthe District of Columbia” mentioned by the majority was not uniformly the result of popular vote\nor legislative enactment.         Nine states now permit same-sex marriage because of judicial\ndecisions, both state and federal: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, New Mexico, and Colorado\n(state supreme court decisions); New Jersey (state superior court decision not appealed by\ndefendant); California (federal district court decision allowed to stand in ruling by United States\nSupreme Court); and Oregon and Pennsylvania (federal district court decisions not appealed by\ndefendants). Despite the majority’s insistence that, as life-tenured judges, we should step aside\nand let the voters determine the future of the state constitutional provisions at issue here, those\nnine federal and state courts have seen no acceptable reason to do so. In addition, another\n16 states have been or soon will be added to the list, by virtue of the Supreme Court’s denial of\ncertiorari review in Kitchen, Bostick, and Baskin, and the Court’s order dissolving the stay in\nLatta. The result has been the issuance of hundreds—perhaps thousands—of marriage licenses\nin the wake of those orders. Moreover, the 35 states that are now positioned to recognize same-\nsex marriage are comparable to the 34 states that permitted interracial marriage when the\n\n\n        6\n          In Tennessee, for example, a proposed amendment must first be approved by a simple majority of both\nhouses. In the succeeding legislative session, which can occur as long as a year or more later, the same proposed\namendment must then be approved “by two-thirds of all the members elected to each house.” Tenn. Const. art. XI,\n§ 3. The proposed amendment is then presented “to the people at the next general election in which a Governor is to\nbe chosen,” id., which can occur as long as three years or more later. If a majority of all citizens voting in the\ngubernatorial election also approve of the proposed amendment, it is considered ratified. The procedure for\namending the constitution by convention can take equally long and is, if anything, more complicated. In Michigan,\na constitutional convention, one of three methods of amendment, can be called no more often than every 16 years.\nSee Mich. Const. art. XII, § 3.\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818        DeBoer v. Snyder                      Page 62\n\nSupreme Court decided Loving. If the majority in this case is waiting for a tipping point, it\nseems to have arrived.\n\n         The second contention is that we should “wait and see” what the fallout is in the states\nwhere same-sex marriage is now legal. The majority points primarily to Massachusetts, where\nsame-sex couples have had the benefit of marriage for “only” ten years—not enough time, the\nmajority insists, to know what the effect on society will be. But in the absence of hard evidence\nthat the sky has actually fallen in, the “states as laboratories of democracy” metaphor and its\npitch for restraint has little or no resonance in the fast-changing scene with regard to same-sex\nmarriage. Yet, whenever the expansion of a constitutional right is proposed, “proceed with\ncaution” seems to be the universal mantra of the opponents. The same argument was made by\nthe State of Virginia in Loving. And, in Frontiero v. Richardson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108781\"><a href=\"/opinion/108781/frontiero-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973), the\ngovernment asked the Court to postpone applying heightened scrutiny to allegations of gender\ndiscrimination in a statute denying equal benefits to women until the Equal Rights Amendment\ncould be ratified. If the Court had listened to the argument, we would, of course, still be waiting.\nOne is reminded of the admonition in Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail”\n(1963): “For years now I have heard the word \"Wait”! . . . [But h]uman progress never rolls in\non wheels of inevitability . . . [and] time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation.”\n\nAnimus\n\n         Finally, there is a need to address briefly the subject of unconstitutional animus, which\nthe majority opinion equates only with actual malice and hostility on the part of members of the\nelectorate. But in many instances involving rational-basis review, the Supreme Court has taken a\nmore objective approach to the classification at issue, rather than a subjective one. Under such\nan analysis, it is not necessary for a court to divine individual malicious intent in order to find\nunconstitutional animus. Instead, the Supreme Court has instructed that an exclusionary law\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause when it is based not upon relevant facts, but instead upon\nonly a general, ephemeral distrust of, or discomfort with, a particular group, for example, when\nlegislation is justified by the bare desire to exclude an unpopular group from a social institution\nor arrangement. In City of Cleburne, for example, the Court struck down a zoning regulation\nthat was justified simply by the “negative attitude” of property owners in the community toward\nindividuals with intellectual disabilities, not necessarily by actual malice toward an unpopular\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818       DeBoer v.

In doing so, the Court held that “the City may not avoid the strictures of the [Equal\nProtection] Clause by deferring to the wishes or objections of some fraction of the body politic,”\n473 U.S. at 448, and cited Palmore v. Sidoti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111160\"><a href=\"/opinion/111160/palmore-v-sidoti/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433 (1984), for the proposition that\n“[p]rivate biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly,\ngive them effect.” In any event, as the majority here concedes, we as a country have such a long\nhistory of prejudice based on sexual orientation that it seems hypocritical to deny the existence\nof unconstitutional animus in the rational-basis analysis of the cases before us.\n\n       To my mind, the soundest description of this analysis is found in Justice Stevens’s\nseparate opinion in City of Cleburne:\n\n       In every equal protection case, we have to ask certain basic questions. What class\n       is harmed by the legislation, and has it been subjected to a “tradition of disfavor”\n       by our laws? What is the public purpose that is being served by the law? What is\n       the characteristic of the disadvantaged class that justifies the disparate treatment?\n       In most cases the answer to these questions will tell us whether the statute has a\n       “rational basis.”\n\nId. at 453 (Stevens, J., concurring) (footnotes omitted). I would apply just this analysis to the\nconstitutional amendments and statutes at issue in these cases, confident that the result of the\ninquiry would be to affirm the district courts’ decisions in all six cases. I therefore dissent from\nthe majority’s decision to overturn those judgments.\n\n       Today, my colleagues seem to have fallen prey to the misguided notion that the intent of\nthe framers of the United States Constitution can be effectuated only by cleaving to the\nlegislative will and ignoring and demonizing an independent judiciary. Of course, the framers\npresciently recognized that two of the three co-equal branches of government were representative\nin nature and necessarily would be guided by self-interest and the pull of popular opinion. To\nrestrain those natural, human impulses, the framers crafted Article III to ensure that rights,\nliberties, and duties need not be held hostage by popular whims.\n\n       More than 20 years ago, when I took my oath of office to serve as a judge on the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, I solemnly swore to “administer justice without\nrespect to persons,” to “do equal right to the poor and to the rich,” and to “faithfully and\nimpartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me . . . under the Constitution\nand laws of the United States.” See 28 U.S.C. § 453. If we in the judiciary do not have the\n\fNos. 14-1341/ 3057/ 3464/ 5291/ 5297/ 5818     DeBoer v.
