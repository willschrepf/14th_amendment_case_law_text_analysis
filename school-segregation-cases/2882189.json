GIBSON, Circuit Judge.\n\n       The Jenkins class, representing the children of the Kansas City, Missouri School\nDistrict in this school desegregation case, has appealed the district court's order\ndeclaring the district unitary and dismissing the case with prejudice. The order followed\na hearing set by the court to consider KCMSD's amended motion for equitable relief\nfrom a ruling of the Missouri State Board of Education declaring that the accreditation\nof KCMSD would be withdrawn effective May 1, 2000. After the district court denied\nKCMSD's motion, it proceeded sua sponte to a discussion of the unitary status of the\ndistrict and declared the district to be unitary. A panel of this court reversed and\nremanded, Jenkins v. Missouri, 205 F.3d 361 (8th Cir. 2000), and we granted KCMSD's\nmotion for rehearing en banc. After receiving additional filings from the parties and\nhearing argument, we reverse and remand.\n\n       We need not discuss in detail the long history of the Kansas City school\ndesegregation litigation. After a finding of constitutional violations, years of effort to\nremedy them, and extended litigation and appeals which we need not catalog, the State\nof Missouri moved for a declaration of unitary status. On March 27, 1997, Judge\nRussell Clark, who had presided over the case since its filing, granted the motion in part,\nbut denied it in part. See Jenkins v. Missouri, 959 F. Supp. 1151(W.D.Mo.), aff'd, 122\nF.3d 588 (8th Cir. 1997) (Jenkins XIV). In particular, Judge Clark held that twenty-six\npercent of the achievement gap of ten normalized curve equivalents between KCMSD's\nblack and white students was a vestige of the constitutional violation, and he ordered\nKCMSD to take reasonable steps to eradicate that vestige within the next three years.\nId. at 1157-65, 1179. At the same time, Judge Clark approved a settlement between\nKCMSD and the State, providing that the State would pay KCMSD $320 million over\nthree years, and in return, would be dismissed from the litigation. Id. at 1180.\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f        On January 28, 1999, the district judge who succeeded Judge Clark to\nsupervision of the case entered an order declaring that the State had paid its obligation\nunder the settlement and dismissing the State from the case. Order of January 28, 1999.\nThe court said that the State must continue to comply with any obligations that it\nundertook during the course of the lawsuit that were not covered by the agreement and\nwarned the State against taking any action that might prevent KCMSD from ultimately\nfulfilling its court-ordered remedial goals. Id. at 6. The court then pointed to Judge\nClark's order giving KCMSD three years to eliminate all the remaining vestiges of\nsegregation; the court commented that fifteen months remained on this time line. Id.\nAfter considering the \"lengthy and litigious process\" likely to attend a renewed motion\nfor unitary status, the court directed the parties to prepare for a unitary status hearing\nto begin on January 3, 2000. Id.\n\n       When KCMSD had hired its new superintendent, Benjamin Demps, the district\njudge, at a hearing on July 19, 1999, told Mr. Demps that a unitary status hearing was\nset for January 3.\n\n       Counsel appeared before the court on August 24, 1999 for a scheduling\nconference, which the court stated was \"to address . . . preparing for a unitary status\nhearing in January,\" and in particular, what evidence the parties anticipated presenting\nin the hearing. Counsel for the class suggested delaying the hearing. He said that it\nwould be difficult for KCMSD to make a case that everything practicable had been\ndone, because there was a \"pretty widely shared agreement that this is not the case.\"\nFurthermore, some test data were not in, and others seemed to show the achievement\ngap had not been closed. Nor had KCMSD implemented the curriculum, professional\ndevelopment, and accountability plans designed to close the gap. Also, KCMSD had\njust hired a new superintendent. The class's counsel suggested a hearing in the late\nsummer of 2000.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f       The court then pointed to Judge Clark's statement that gave the district three years\nto eliminate the vestiges of discrimination. The court stated he \"believed the Supreme\nCourt when they told me to get this school district returned to local control\" and that\nboth he and Judge Clark had given KCMSD three years to comply.\n\n       Counsel for the class pointed out that recently the monitoring had been less\nheavy-handed, and that the monitoring committee, which was commonly referred to as\nthe DMC, had been sending things back to the new superintendent to handle. Counsel\nsaid there were many ways the committee could lighten its monitoring. Counsel for the\nclass stated that he did not anticipate that he would be presenting new approaches or\nanything other than implementation of the five programs already planned for reducing\nthe black-white achievement gap: the curriculum, classroom practices, professional\ndevelopment, assessment, and accountability plans.\n\n       The district court then stated that he sensed that both the class and KCMSD were\n\"pretty satisfied that the school district can't . . . go forward with the burden of proof that\nthe gap has narrowed.\"1 He said he would need to have a hearing to take testimony\nfrom one of the experts who testified at the earlier unitariness hearing and also to hear\nwhether the district was \"on track\" in implementing the five programs. The court\ncommented that the problem had been the delay in implementation of the five plans to\nreduce the achievement gap. The court further commented that the track record of the\ndistrict had not convinced him that KCMSD was putting heart and soul behind\nimplementing the five plans or that KCMSD could get out of the political mode and get\ninto looking after the best interests of the children.\n\n       1\n        This statement came after the following exchange. When the class counsel said\nin court there was \"widely shared agreement\" that KCMSD had not done everything\npracticable to eradicate the achievement gap, KCMSD did not object to this\nrepresentation. KCMSD's counsel said: \"[W]e have a sense at the moment . . . that\nthe district would have an uphill fight in January.\"\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\f      Following this conference, the court filed a written order formally denying the\nmotion for a continuance, stating:\n\n      [T]he Court provided for termination of the [DMC] by March 25, 2000.\n      See Order at 21, Doc. # 4575 (August 21, 1997), . . . . [E]ven if the\n      KCMSD has not attained unitary status, all three Monitors would be\n      removed. See id. At that time, the Court would need to determine the\n      need for new Monitors or even a new remedial structure. Such a\n      determination cannot be made without evidence of the KCMSD's current\n      status.\n\n             ....\n\n            . . . The [unitary status] hearing will begin, as scheduled, on January\n      3, 2000.\n\nOrder of August 26, 1999 at 17-18 (emphasis added).\n\n      On October 21, 1999, the State Board of Education voted to withdraw\naccreditation of KCMSD as of May 1, 2000. In response, KCMSD filed an amended\nmotion for equitable relief on October 25, 1999, seeking to bar the State's action on the\nground that it would interfere with the remedial decree in Jenkins.2 That same day, the\ncourt issued an order setting KCMSD's motion for hearing on November 1 to hear\nevidence on three enumerated issues: whether the court should (1) rejoin the State as\na party; (2) declare void ab initio the action of the Missouri State Board of Education\nin classifying KCMSD as an unaccredited school district; and (3) enjoin the application\nto KCMSD of several statutes on which the State Board's action was based.\n\n\n\n      2\n       In KCMSD's motion for relief from the de-accreditation action, it asked the\ncourt to stay the de-accreditation until the five remedial plans had been fully\nimplemented.\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f        The court held the hearing on KCMSD's motion on November 1-2, 1999. We\nneed not discuss in detail the testimony before the court, except to state that it was\ndirected to the issues outlined by the district court in its order of October 25. The\nparties agreed in oral argument before the panel that the hearing was not a unitary status\nhearing. At the conclusion of the proceedings of November 2, the court asked\nKCMSD's staff counsel whether the KCMSD board agreed there should be a unitary\nstatus hearing in January. Counsel stated that the board voted unanimously to seek a\ncontinuance and authorized her to agree to a continuation of the monitoring committee\nin its current configuration until the end of the 1999-2000 academic year in June.\n\n       On November 9, 1999, KCMSD filed a written motion requesting a continuance\nof the unitary status hearing set for January 3, 2000, and consenting to continued\nsupervision by the DMC. KCMSD further suggested that it would be appropriate to\nextend the term limits of the DMC beyond March 25, 2000, and to set a hearing at the\nend of the academic school year, June 3, 2000, to assess the role of the DMC and\nconsider a reduction in the scope of the oversight by that body in the future.\n\n       On November 17 the district court issued an order denying KCMSD's request to\nrejoin the State as a party and refusing to declare void ab initio the action of the State\nBoard of Education classifying KCMSD as an unaccredited school district.3 After ruling\non the motion before it, the court proceeded sua sponte to consider the issue of whether\nthe district was unitary. In light of the nature of our ruling, it is not necessary that we\nset out in detail the substance of the court's reasoning. Suffice it to say that, much to the\nparties' surprise, the court ended by declaring that the KCMSD had achieved unitary\nstatus. The court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\n\n       3\n       The action of the State Board of Education was effective May 1, 2000.\nKCMSD has two years in which to regain accreditation and, if it does not, further\nserious consequences, including dissolution of the district, may follow.\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\f                                           I.\n\n       The issue before us is whether the district court erred in determining KCMSD to\nbe unitary and dismissing the case without taking evidence or hearing arguments.\n\n       In January 1999 the court scheduled a hearing on unitary status for January 2000,\nand both in a conference with counsel and a written order in August 1999 commented\nspecifically on the necessity for a hearing to evaluate what continuing judicial\ninvolvement would be required. The order setting the November 1-2, 1999 hearing\nlimited that hearing to the issues of whether the State should be rejoined as a party and\nwhether the de-accreditation order should be declared void ab initio. The transcript\ndiscloses that the testimony and evidence at the hearing were directed to these issues.\nThe court's inquiry at the conclusion of the November 1-2 hearing as to whether there\nshould be a unitary status hearing in January demonstrates that the court did not consider\nit had conducted such a hearing. KCMSD's counsel's response to this inquiry by the\ncourt and its written motion filed November 9, 1999 for a continuance of the unitariness\nhearing demonstrate that KCMSD did not consider that there had been a hearing on\nunitary status.\n\n       It is evident from what we have said above that KCMSD did nothing to contest\nthe Jenkins class's statements that KCMSD was not ready to move forward and\nestablish that KCMSD was unitary, and the judge acknowledged as much. From this\nand from the court's order limiting the proof at the November 1-2 hearing, the Jenkins\nclass as well as KCMSD went into the hearing with no expectation that unitary status\nwas an issue to be tried.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\f       In Jenkins XIV we held, based upon abundant Supreme Court authority, that once\nthere has been a finding that a defendant established an unlawful dual school system in\nthe past, there is a presumption that current disparities of the sort listed in Green v.\nCounty School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 435 (1968), are the result of the defendant's\nunconstitutional conduct. See Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 593. Therefore, the burden of\nproving unitariness rests on the constitutional violator. Id. at 593-95. Our statement in\nJenkins XIV found support in Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 494 (1992), where the\nSupreme Court stated with respect to racial imbalance in student attendance caused by\nthe unlawful policy of a school system, \"The School District bears the burden of\nshowing that any current imbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to the prior\nviolation.\" Other statements in Freeman similarly recognized that the burden was on the\ndistrict to demonstrate a good faith commitment to compliance with the desegregation\nplan. Id. at 498-99. This presumption places the burden in any hearing on unitary status\non KCMSD, including the issue of reduction in student achievement and the\nachievement gap. KCMSD admittedly made no attempt to demonstrate that unitary\nstatus had been achieved.4\n\n\n      4\n       In Jenkins XIV, we pointed to the finding of the district court in the first\nremedial order decisions that \"the inferior education indigenous of the state-compelled\ndual school system has lingering effects in the Kansas City, Missouri School District.\"\n122 F.3d at 594 (quoting Jenkins v. Missouri, 593 F. Supp. 1485, 1492 (W.D. Mo.\n1984)). We also quoted later findings, \"Segregation has caused a system wide\nreduction in student achievement in the schools of the KCMSD. . . . [The] education\nprocess has been further 'bogged down' in the KCMSD by a history of segregated\neducation. Too often, as a result, a higher percentage of black students are among the\nlower achievers.\" Id. (quoting Jenkins v. Missouri, 639 F. Supp. 19, 24, 28 (W.D. Mo.\n1985), aff'd as modified, 807 F.2d 657 (8th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 816\n(1987)). The district court found that the adverse effect on minority student\nachievement still persisted in 1997 in the form of an achievement gap; we held that\nfinding was not clearly erroneous. Id. at 597-99.\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f       This court stated in Booker v. Special School District No. 1, 585 F.2d 347, 352\n(8th Cir. 1978), \"There is no question that in a proper case a federal district court that\nhas issued an injunction may vacate it or modify it if it is established that to continue it\nin force or without modification would work an inequitable result.\" (emphasis added.)\n\n       In United States v. Board of School Commissioners, 128 F.3d 507 (7th Cir.\n1997), the Seventh Circuit faced a situation nearly identical to the one before us today.\nThere, the Board of School Commissioners of the Indianapolis Public School District\nrequested that the judge lift an injunction requiring busing of public school students on\nthe ground that the district had achieved unitary status.5 The district court declined to\naddress the issue of unitary status, but modified its existing order by extending the\nbusing to kindergartners, an issue that had not been raised by the parties. The Seventh\nCircuit, in an opinion by Chief Judge Posner, stated:\n\n       No one asked the judge for this modification; there was no hearing on it.\n       As a result, there is nothing in the judge's order, or in the record on which\n       it is based, about the respective kindergarten programs, facilities, and\n       capacities in the transferor and transferee areas or about the\n       appropriateness of compelling the busing of such young children against\n       their parents' wishes and whether they are to be in the same buses with\n       much older children.\n\n128 F.3d at 512. In support of the court's order that they, like KCMSD here, did not\nseek in the first place, the appellees pointed out that the district judge had \"learned a\nlot about public school education in Marion County in the thirty years that he has been\npresiding over this litigation.\" Id. The Seventh Circuit responded:\n\n\n       5\n        The Seventh Circuit's opinion stated that a district wanting to phase out a\ndesegregation decree could be permitted to do so only upon presenting evidence that\nthe existing order had outlived its usefulness. See 128 F.3d at 510.\n\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\f       [G]reat knowledge is a temptation as well as a resource: a temptation to\n       blur the separation of powers, to shift the balance between the federal\n       courts and state and local government too far toward the courts, and to\n       disregard procedural niceties, all in fulfillment of a confident sense of\n       mission.\n\nId.\n\n      Although the Seventh Circuit was dealing with expansion of a remedy and we\ndeal with the elimination of one, the principle is the same: procedural niceties equate\nwith due process and must be afforded the parties. As the Seventh Circuit vacated the\nsua sponte order and remanded for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing, so\nshould we.\n\n       The parties are entitled to notice and an opportunity to prepare for a unitary status\nhearing. KCMSD would carry the burden of proof at such a hearing, and the Jenkins\nclass would be entitled to an opportunity to respond. Due process of law requires no\nless. The sua sponte ruling of the district court, in spite of its several earlier orders\nsetting the unitary status hearing some two months later, deprived the Jenkins Class of\nthis constitutional guarantee.\n\n        Counsel for KCMSD conceded that the court's ruling was on a ground not argued\nby the parties, but insisted that the court was thinking ahead of KCMSD. Having\nachieved its unexpected release from litigation, KCMSD hastens to give support to the\nruling.\n\n      KCMSD argues that the district court did not err in declaring KCMSD unitary\nwithout benefit of notice, hearing, argument, or other evidentiary presentation.\nKCMSD cites Link v. Wabash Railroad Co., 370 U.S. 626 (1962), for the principle that\n\n\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f\"Parties are not always entitled to a hearing.\" Link has little, if any, relevance to this\ncase. In Link, the district court set a pretrial conference and notified counsel. When\nthe lawyer for the plaintiff did not appear at the time set, the court dismissed the action\nfor failure to appear and failure to prosecute. Id. at 629. Link did no more than rule\nthat the dismissal for failure to prosecute was not an abuse of discretion. Id. at 633.\n\n        Link is about sanctions, not about what opportunity parties should be given to\npresent evidence and make argument before a ruling on the merits of their case. It\ncertainly is not about the proper procedure for dismissal of a school desegregation case\nin which a school district has been adjudged liable for constitutional violations and\nsubjected to a remedial decree. However, Link does have some general applicability\nto this case insofar as it discussed the circumstances that can justify entry of an order\nwithout the opportunity to be heard: \"The adequacy of notice and hearing respecting\nproceedings that may affect a party's rights turns, to a considerable extent, on the\nknowledge which the circumstances show such party may be taken to have of the\nconsequences of his own conduct.\" 370 U.S. at 332. Unlike Link, where the attorney\nhad notice of the pretrial conference and should have known that his failure to appear\nwould have consequences, in this case there was no notice to any of the parties, either\nconstitutional violator or victims, that the issue of unitary status was to be considered\nand decided at the November hearing. To the contrary, there was every assurance that\nunitary status would not be considered until the scheduled January 2000 hearing, and\nKCMSD's requests for continuance strongly suggested that it would not even be in a\nposition to contend that the district was unitary in January 2000. Link demonstrates\nthat simple fairness requires notice and hearing before a decision that dismisses the\ncase.\n\n      At oral argument, KCMSD's counsel suggested that the Jenkins class had the\nopportunity to present evidence on the unitariness question at the hearing on the class's\n\n\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fmotion to stay the dismissal pending appeal. The opportunity to argue a stay motion,\nwith the class having the burden on four discrete issues, which placed the constitutional\nvictims in the position of arguing that the horse should be put back in the barn, does not\nsubstitute for a chance to present evidence and argue the merits in a hearing called for\nthe purpose of determining unitariness.\n\n       The sua sponte ruling declaring the district unitary and releasing the admitted\nconstitutional violator from further court supervision, without giving notice either to the\nconstitutional violator or the victims or permitting the parties to present evidence and\nargue these issues, was error.6\n\n                                            II.\n\n       The Jenkins class, through its counsel, informed the district court and conceded\nto this court that the issues in the case had come down to implementation of the five\nplans (classroom practices, professional development, assessment, accountability and\ncurriculum) crafted to improve student achievement and eliminate the achievement gap\nbetween white and black students. Counsel conceded to us, as well as to the district\ncourt, that when these five plans have been implemented satisfactorily, he will have no\nfurther plans to suggest. The remaining issues have been thus narrowed.\n\n\n      6\n         The court has not found it necessary today to reach the merits of the district\ncourt's order. Both dissents, however, are focused on the merits of the case, and almost\nexclusively on the 1997 opinions of the district court and this court, Jenkins v.\nMissouri, 959 F. Supp. 1151 (W.D. Mo.), aff'd,122 F.3d 588 (8th Cir. 1997) (Jenkins\nXIV). After the decision in Jenkins XIV, none of the parties asked for rehearing or\nfiled a petition for certiorari. The parties before us have not raised the issues discussed\nin the dissents. Indeed, both parties have accepted Jenkins XIV as the standard under\nwhich the unitary status issue must be considered.\n\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\f        The panel ordered that on remand the judges of the Western District of Missouri\nshould assign this case to another district judge. 205 F.3d at 370. KCMSD objects to\nthe reassignment order and argues that it was improperly entered. Eight of the judges\nof this court have determined that the court should not order reassignment on remand.7\n\n     We reverse and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\nThe mandate shall issue forthwith.\n\n\n\nWOLLMAN, Chief Judge, with whom MORRIS SHEPPARD ARNOLD, Circuit\nJudge, joins, concurring.\n\n       I agree with the court that the district court erred in not according the parties the\nunitary status hearing that had been promised to them. Accordingly, I join in the\nholding reversing the order appealed from and remanding the case to the district court\nwithout reassignment to another district judge.\n\n       I write separately only to indicate that I do not wish my agreement with the\ndisposition of the appeal to be read as my endorsement of all that is said within the\nopinion regarding this court’s earlier opinions in this case, or of all that is said\nregarding what the School District must show to satisfy the district court that it is\nentitled to a declaration that it has achieved unitary status. For me, it is enough to say\nthat the district court should have given the parties the hearing it had promised them.\nThe court’s opinion now assures them of that hearing, which I hope will be held in the\nreasonably near future. As the court notes, class counsel suggested last August that the\nunitary status hearing be set in late summer of 2000, and the School District suggested\n\n       7\n        Judges Heaney, McMillian, John R. Gibson, and Bye would order reassignment\nof the case on remand to another district judge.\n\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\flast November that a hearing be set at the end of the 1999-2000 academic year, which\nwill occur on June 3.\n\n       Whether the School District will be able to carry its burden of demonstrating that\nit has achieved unitary status, I do not know. By the time a unitary status hearing is\nheld, the School District will have had a number of months to take further steps\ntowards implementing the several remedial programs since the district court’s\nNovember 1999 order dismissing the case. What steps the School District has taken\nduring those intervening months may well be a measure of its commitment to its self-\nproclaimed good-faith efforts to take all practicable steps towards eliminating the\nprovable vestiges of discrimination.\n\nHEANEY, Circuit Judge, with whom McMILLIAN, Circuit Judge, joins, concurring.\n\n       I wholly concur in Judge John R. Gibson's well-reasoned opinion. Taking care\nto stay on the path established by the precedents of the United States Supreme Court\nand this court, Judge Gibson correctly holds that the students and parents of the\nKCMSD were denied due process when the district court declared the school district\nunitary without affording them notice or a hearing. I write separately to express more\nfully my reasons for agreeing with the majority opinion and to correct the revisionist\nhistory painted by Judge Beam's dissent.\n\n       The Kansas City schools remained segregated until 1986. In that year, we\napproved a plan to desegregate them after more than forty-five years of slavery--when\nthe state forbid the education of blacks, see Laws of the State of Missouri, 14th\nGeneral Assembly, 1st Session at 104 (Jefferson City 1847)--and 120 years of\nsegregation--when public schools for black students were not only separate, but inferior\nto those for white students, see Brown v. Board of Educ., 349 U.S. 294 (1955). We\n\n\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fbelieved that if the court-ordered plan was fully and faithfully implemented, white city\nstudents who attended private and parochial schools would return to the public school\nsystem, and white suburban students would be attracted to integrated magnet schools\nto be established in the city. Importantly, we also stated that a voluntary interdistrict\ntransfer program similar to that in St. Louis should be implemented in Kansas City.\n\n        As a result of the 1986 decrees, the facilities have improved, more books and\nteaching aids are available, class size has been reduced, remedial and compensatory\neducational programs have been funded and implemented, and educational\nopportunities for black and white students alike have improved. Although Kansas\nCity's public schools have improved, they would be better had the State and the\nKCMSD promptly complied with the Supreme Court's unanimous instruction in 1955\nto \"desegregate with all deliberate speed,\" id. at 301, or with the Supreme Court's\nunanimous opinion in 1968 \"that the time for mere deliberate speed has run out . . . .\nThe burden on the school board today is to come forward with a plan that promises\nrealistically to work and promises realistically to work now,\" Green v. County Sch.\nBd., 391 U.S. 430, 438-39 (1968). Moreover, the State and the KCMSD could have\nensured further improvement for the schools had they promptly and positively complied\nwith the district court's 1986 desegregation orders.8\n\n\n\n\n      8\n        Among the programs approved by the district court and this court were library,\nteaching load, and curriculum improvements; additional counselors; summer school\nprograms; full-day kindergarten; before and after school tutoring; and early childhood\ndevelopment programs. Also approved were a student achievement program and a\nclass size reduction. The programs were designed to remedy the effects of the dual\nsystem and to bring about systematic educational improvements. Jenkins v. Missouri,\n807 F.2d 657, 682-83 (8th Cir. 1986) (en banc) (Jenkins I).\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f       The fact is that 165 years of racial discrimination simply could not be overcome\nin fourteen short years of court supervision, particularly without the full cooperation of\nthe State, the KCMSD, and the suburban schools. Over this period, none of these\nentities made any effort to implement a voluntary interdistrict transfer program, thus\npreventing complete integration of the Kansas City schools.9 Further, the State Board\n\n\n      9\n          In Jenkins I, we stated:\n\n      A voluntary interdistrict transfer program is one that has great potential\n      for improving the racial balance in the Kansas City area. The experience\n      in St. Louis with such a plan seems to have been favorable. The district\n      court is correct in its holding that such a program cannot be mandatorily\n      imposed upon the record before the court. Whether a refusal of a district\n      to participate in such a voluntary program may evidence discriminatory\n      intent and thus be an independent basis for further relief and mandatory\n      participation is an issue that we should not anticipate.\n\n807 F.2d at 683 n.30. In his concurrence, Judge Arnold stated:\n\n      I would hold that the District Court erred in concluding that the SSDs\n      cannot be required to participate in an interdistrict remedy for interdistrict\n      school segregation caused by the State's constitutional violations in the\n      area of housing. The case should be remanded to the District Court for\n      determination of the current interdistrict effects, if any, of the State's\n      housing violations. Any SSDs implicated by this analysis should be\n      obliged to participate in an appropriately tailored interdistrict remedy.\n\nId. at 687 (Arnold, J., concurring). Furthermore, Judge Ross stated:\n\n      At the time of argument it was my understanding that a voluntary\n      interdistrict program, patterned along the lines of the St. Louis program\n      was a real possibility. It would now appear that some of the districts are\n      not moving forward with this plan.\n\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fof Education took no responsibility for the KCMSD’s performance, and never once\nduring the fourteen-year period moved to implement the quality education programs\ncalled for in Judge Clark's plan. It simply complied with the district court's funding\norders. In addition, the constant bickering between the State and the KCMSD and the\nnumerous changes in leadership in the Kansas City schools obviously did not inspire\ncommunity, parental, or student confidence in the school district.\n\n       There is no doubt that the KCMSD currently is faced with more than its fair\nshare of difficulties--difficulties brought on in large measure by the State. Shortly after\nreceiving a judgment declaring that it had satisfied its obligations and being dismissed\nfrom this case, the State took two dramatic actions that will impair the KCMSD's\nability to provide a quality education for its students. First, it authorized the creation\nof charter schools in St. Louis and Kansas City, and second, it de-accredited the\nKansas City schools effective May 1, 2000 because students have done poorly on\nstudent achievement tests.\n\n       It is, of course, appropriate for the State to create charter schools, but it is\ndifficult to understand why it authorized the creation of these schools only in the state's\ntwo largest cities, both of which enroll a large majority of black students. Additionally,\nthe KCMSD is required to pay the cost of educating and transporting the students who\nattend these schools. As a result, Kansas City's public schools will have a more\n\n\n      In my opinion the failure to organize and implement this program would\n      be a very significant factor in determining discriminatory intent in the\n      future litigation which is certain to result from the further processing of\n      this case. The St. Louis program would be a useful model for the actions\n      to be taken by all the Missouri districts which are parties to this action.\n\nId. (Ross, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\fdifficult time providing the trained teachers, the educational programs, and the materials\nnecessary to ensure improved achievement of those students, overwhelmingly black,\nwho remain in the public schools.10\n\n       To make matters worse, the de-accreditation of the KCMSD allows students to\nattend schools in any other district within the state at the KCMSD’s expense. It is\nnoteworthy that the State, which has opposed interdistrict transfers over the past\nfourteen years, now suddenly approves of such transfers. The only logical explanation\nfor the State's sudden change of heart is that the cost of transfers must now be paid by\nthe KCMSD rather than the State. There is also a serious question as to whether the\nsuburban schools will accept large numbers of Kansas City's black students.\n\n     Before concluding, I must take issue with some of the comments in Judge\nBeam’s dissent. First, his assertion that “[s]tudent scores as measured by routine and\n\n\n      10\n         If the number of Kansas City public school children enrolled in the charter\nschools remains constant in FY 2001, the KCMSD will be limited to spending $8,240\nper pupil unless it is able to raise additional money through local taxation. (J.A. at\n1041.) Moreover, witnesses for the KCMSD testified that they expect 3,200 pupils to\ntransfer to other districts at a total cost to the KCMSD of $35,892,000. (J.A. at 1043.)\nIf this number of students transferred, the KCMSD will have just $7,450 per pupil\navailable to educate its remaining 28,000 students. (J.A. at 1045.)\n        Contrary to Judge Beam's assertion that Kansas City per pupil spending is well\nabove that spent by any other school district in Missouri, the fact is that in the 1998-99\nschool year, the last year for which statistics are available, several school districts in\nthe State of Missouri expended more per pupil than did the KCMSD, including\nBrentwood, $8,735; Clayton, $11,239; Ladue, $9,938; and Center, $8,583. See Office\nof Social and Economic Data Analysis, University of Missouri,\n<http://www.oseda.missouri.edu/countypage>. Since the 1994-95 school year,\nKCMSD's per pupil spending has declined by 21%, while per pupil spending in the\nabove-cited school districts increased on average 19.5%. See id.\n\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fregularly administered standardized tests have remained static or have declined\" is\nunfounded. From 1987 to 1994, KCMSD student test scores not only improved in most\ngrades, but significantly improved. In 1995, however, the test scores dropped, resulting\nin those cited by Judge Beam. The reasons for the decline are unexplained in the\nrecord and may be explored during the unitary status hearing. Below is a comparison\nof the test scores from 1988 to 1994.\n\n\n Grade       1987-88      1993-94     Change       1987-88     1993-94      Change\n             Math         Math                     Reading     Reading\n K           53.4         58.6        5.2+         63.0        65.4(‘90)    2.4+\n 1           48.9         57.4        8.5+         45.8        49.9         4.1+\n 2           50.6         55.3        4.7+         45.6        46.3         .7+\n 3           43.4         49.5        6.1+         41.3        44.2         2.9+\n 4           46.0         49.2        3.2+         42.6        43.5         .9+\n 5           43.8         50.0        6.2+         43.1        45.4         2.3+\n 6           42.2         42.4        .2+          40.6        40.6         0\n 7           40.9         40.5        .4-          42.0        42.6         .6+\n 8           40.3         41.2        .9+          41.7        42.9         1.2+\n\n             1989-90      1993-94     Change       1989-90     1993-94      Change\n             Math         Math                     Reading     Reading\n 9           37.7         34.3        3.4-         41.4        38.3         3.1-\n 10          39.7         37.8        1.9-         41.8        40.0         1.8-\n 11          41.2         41.8        .6+          41.6        41.2         .4-\n 12          42.0         43.7        1.7+         41.3        42.1         .8+\n\n\n\n\n                                            -20-\n\f        Second, Judge Beam states that KCMSD \"students remain as racially isolated\nas when the first remedial order was entered.\" He notes that in 1986 twenty-five\nschools had a 90%+ minority enrollment, and in 1999, that number had increased to\ntwenty-seven. His statements are misleading. The number of racially-isolated schools\nin the KCMSD decreased from twenty-five in 1986 to sixteen in 1996. See KCMSD\nStudent Census Count (Sept. 25, 1996; Jan. 29, 1997; Sept. 24, 1997; Jan. 28, 1998;\nSept. 30, 1998; Jan. 27, 1999). Only in the past three years has the number of racially-\nisolated schools jumped from sixteen to twenty-seven, a 69% increase. Such a\nsubstantial increase may indicate that the KCMSD is in the process of resegregating\nitself.\n\n       Third, Judge Beam asserts that $2 billion in tax dollars has been spent since 1985\nto fund the plan to desegregate the Kansas City schools. Accepting the validity of that\nstatement for the purpose of this concurring opinion, I note that over the fourteen-year\nperiod, the State and the KCMSD spent an average of $142,800,000 per year or\napproximately $3,900 per pupil. Of this sum, Kansas City contributed approximately\n$417 million or $833 per pupil per year.\n\n       This expenditure by the State and the KCMSD to desegregate Kansas City's\nschools must be viewed in context. As previously noted, black children were denied\nany education for forty-five years and were provided an inferior, segregated education\nfor 120 years. Although the precise dollar amount is not contained in the record, it is\nclear that both the State and the KCMSD saved hundreds of millions of dollars during\nthe slavery and segregation periods. The expenditures for desegregation must be\nbalanced against the savings made over 165 years.\n\n       Of all the conclusions reached by Judge Beam in his dissent, the most disturbing\nis that it is beyond the KCMSD’s power, with or without the cooperation of the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fMissouri State Board of Education, to close the achievement gap between black and\nwhite students even to the modest degree required by the district court and now\nrequired by this court. The fact of the matter is that achievement levels of Kansas\nCity's black students have improved and will continue to improve as long as the State\nand the KCMSD understand that it is their responsibility to do everything reasonably\npracticable to achieve this result.\n\n       As the Supreme Court made clear in Board of Educ. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237,\n247 (1991), withdrawal of federal supervision requires not only compliance with the\ncommands of the Equal Protection Clause, but also a showing “that it [is] unlikely that\nthe Board [will] return to its former ways.” Thus to achieve unitary status, the\nKCMSD must demonstrate not only that it has eliminated racial isolation to the extent\npracticable, see Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 90 (1995), but also that it will\nmaintain those gains when the litigation ends. Absent a unitary status hearing, it could\nnot be determined whether the KCMSD has met these requirements.\n\n       No one knows what will occur next, but one thing is certain: Kansas City needs\ngood public schools that offer all students, black or white, rich or poor, a good\neducation. Without a good public school system, all of Kansas City will suffer–the\ncommunity, the parents, and most of all the students who deserve an education which\nwill enable them to be productive citizens. If the State of Missouri now believes that\nthe KCMSD is not capable of operating the Kansas City schools, it can and should take\nover the schools and try its hand at giving the students a quality desegregated\neducation. If the State is unwilling to do so–and to this point it has been–it should not\npenalize the students by dismantling the KCMSD. Rather the State should find a way\nto work with the KCMSD to improve education and provide the resources necessary\nto achieve that end.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fJOHN R. GIBSON, Circuit Judge, with whom HEANEY and McMILLIAN, Circuit\nJudges, join, writing separately.\n\n      I write separately in concurrence to expand upon the statement that appears in\nfootnote 6 of the court's opinion and to respond to the dissents.\n\n       Both dissents argue that the district court failed to follow the ruling of the\nSupreme Court in Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70 (1995) (Jenkins III). The district\ncourt specifically referred to the directions in Jenkins III that it should \"decide whether\nthe reduction in achievement by minority students attributable to prior de jure\nsegregation has been remedied to [the] extent practicable\" and identify the \"incremental\neffect that segregation has had on minority student achievement or the specific goals\nof the quality education programs.\" Jenkins v. Missouri, 959 F. Supp. 1151, 1155\n(W.D. Mo.) (quoting Jenkins III, 515 U.S. at 101), aff'd, 122 F.3d 588 (8th Cir. 1997)\n(Jenkins XIV).\n\n       Judge Beam asserts that \"Jenkins III does not authorize a purported achievement\ngap as a vestige.\" Infra at 33. In fact, Jenkins III neither \"authorizes\" nor forbids\nreliance on this type of vestige; rather, it tells us to look at the evidence in the case to\ndetermine what part of the gap (if any) was caused by the constitutional violation. See\n515 U.S. at 101. Judge Clark so found, 959 F. Supp. at 1157-65, and we held his\nfindings were not clearly erroneous. See Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 597-99. Jenkins\nXIV is thus the law of the case.\n\n       Judge Clark's order faithfully followed Jenkins III.\n\n       KCMSD does not now ask us to reconsider Jenkins XIV, nor did the present\ndistrict judge suggest that he was reconsidering it or applying any exception to the law\n\n\n\n\n                                           -23-\n\fof the case doctrine. Further, when the case was before us in 1997, KCMSD sought\nand supported the ruling that the achievement gap was a vestige of segregation. In its\nJenkins XIV brief, KCMSD stated: \"KCMSD's expert, whom the court declared\ncredible, established the causal connection between de jure segregation and current\nminority student achievement.\" Brief at 36. \"KCMSD presented substantial evidence\nthat the student achievement vestige continues, consistent with Jenkins III standards.\"\nBrief at 35. KCMSD benefitted from the Jenkins XIV ruling, which allowed it to retain\nthe $4.96 tax levy imposed to fund the remedy for the continuing constitutional\nviolation. See 959 F. Supp. at 1154-55. KCMSD, having sought that ruling and having\nenjoyed the benefits of it, does not now seek to repudiate it.\n\n        Judge Loken states that Judge Clark \"did not make the critical finding that any\nachievement gap among students within the KCMSD was also a vestige of\ndiscrimination with a causal link to the de jure violation being remedied.\" Infra at 46\n(internal quotation omitted). Judge Clark stated: \"The Court finds that Dr. Trent's test\nis reliable and accurately identifies the incremental portion [of the achievement gap]\nattributable to the prior de jure discrimination.\" 959 F. Supp. at 1164. Later, in\nsumming up his findings, Judge Clark wrote: \"The Court has found that 13% of the\ninitial gap and 13% of the increase in the gap may be traced to the prior discrimination\nwithin the KCMSD.\" Id. at 1165.\n\n       Judge Loken contends that Judge Clark should not have imposed the burden of\nproof on the constitutional violators to show that the achievement gap was not caused\nby the constitutional violations. This burden of proof question was fully considered and\ndecided in our 1997 opinion. See Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 593-95. In KCMSD's brief\nfiled with this court in 1997, it argued that \"[t]he burden of demonstrating . . . that\nunitary status exists, rests squarely with the constitutional violator.\" Brief at 29.\nAlthough this argument dealt with the State as a constitutional violator, KCMSD has\n\n\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\fadmitted that it is also a constitutional violator and that the burden of proof rests with\nit. At no point in the proceedings below or in this court has KCMSD taken any\nposition other than that it bears the burden of proof to demonstrate unitary status.\n\n\n\nBEAM, Circuit Judge, with whom BOWMAN and LOKEN, Circuit Judges, join,\ndissenting.\n\n       After twenty-three years of federal court supervision, the educational program\nof the Kansas City Missouri School District (KCMSD) is in shambles. Its students\nremain as racially isolated as when the first remedial order was entered by the district\ncourt on June 14, 1985.11 Student scores as measured by routine and regularly\nadministered standardized tests have remained static or have declined,12 and this has\n\n\n      11\n        In 1986, the KCMSD had a minority student population of 73.5% with twenty-\nfive schools having greater than 90% minority enrollment. See Jenkins v. School Dist.\nof Kansas City, Missouri, 73 F. Supp. 2d 1058, 1069 (W.D. Mo. 1999) (Jenkins X).\nAs of January 1999, KCMSD had a minority student population of 81.8% and twenty-\nseven schools had greater than 90% minority enrollment. See id. However, because\nthe Supreme Court in Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 98 (1995) (Jenkins III),\neliminated the \"desegregative attractiveness\" remedial plan, KCMSD could no longer\noperate its extensive magnet school program nor could it provide transportation for\nnon-resident students. Given what the Supreme Court said it could use as a remedy,\nand an increase of the minority population of 8.3%, KCMSD has done everything\npracticable to reduce the racial isolation in the KCMSD and no one has disputed this\nconclusion in this appeal.\n      12\n        The KCMSD provided the Iowa Test of Basic Skills scores for every grade\nlevel beginning in the 1987-88 school year continuing until at least the 1994-95 school\nyear with the exception of kindergarten. I have placed the earliest and most recent\nscores in table form, noting the change in average test scores over this period.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -25-\n\foccurred even though over two-billion tax dollars have been spent since 1985 on the\nremedial plan alone, with total educational spending averaging more than $9,000 per\nstudent per year (in addition to millions of dollars in capital expenditures). I am\nconfident that this average per pupil amount is well above that spent by any other\nschool district in Missouri for the same period.13 Until 1996, attorneys for the Jenkins\nclass freely roamed the classrooms, hallways and playgrounds monitoring, observing,\ntalking and projecting themselves into the work and educational lives of school\nprincipals, faculty, staff and students.

Joint Appendix at\n1109-11. Unremarkably, the Office of Superintendent of Schools, the supposed chief\nexecutive of the school system, has been a revolving door and once the office was\nempty for a significant period of time.

Supp. 2d 1058, 1072 (W.D. Mo. 1999)\n(Jenkins X). Finally, the State has now designated the KCMSD as unaccredited.\n\n\n\n\n      The Jenkins class provided the Missouri Assessment Program results. The\nstudents are placed in one of five categories, and the percentage of students placed in\neach category for each of the testing years is noted in table form. Both tables are in the\naddendum to this opinion.\n      13\n        The per pupil expenditures (exclusive of amounts for capital improvements)\nwere as follows: 1993–$8,626; 1994–$9,646, 1995–$10,308; 1996–$9,320; and in\n1997–$8,688. Joint Appendix at 971 and 1054. In 1999, for instance, KCMSD had\na per pupil expenditure of $8,239. See Missouri Department of Elementary and\nSecondary Education, 1999 School District Report Card,\nhttp://www.dese.state.mo.us/reportsummary/districts/048078.html. In 1999, the\naverage expenditure per pupil in Missouri was $5,925. See id.\n\n\n\n                                          -26-\n\f      As regrettable and tragic as this situation is, none of the parts in this parade of\nproblems rises to the level of past or present invidious discrimination remediable by a\nfederal court. In short, a school district in shambles is not a constitutional violation.14\n\n      14\n        In his concurrence Judge Heaney contends that I paint a \"revisionist history\"\nof this litigation. While I sincerely wish that I could revise the history of this\ntroublesome case, I have not done so. I have, instead, accurately reflected the record\nthat was before Judge Whipple and have amply provided citations that support my\nstatements and conclusions.\n\n        Judge Heaney discusses the sordid history of slavery in America, a circumstance\nwe all regret, and discusses the unequal and unlawful dual school system that existed\nin Missouri prior to 1954. These facts, of course, are relevant, if at all, only to the\ninitial matter of unconstitutional segregation, a holding long since determined and\nratified and not now at issue in this or any recent appeal.\n\n       Judge Heaney also faults the State of Missouri for its alleged failure to embrace\nhis pedagogical and social vision of how the Kansas City school system should have\nbeen operated since 1986, a failure of acceptance shared, at least in part, by many\nschool administrators and other local public officials, parents of students of all races\nand numerous teachers and their collective bargaining representative. However, as the\nSupreme Court pointedly noted in Jenkins III, most of Judge Heaney's vision falls well\noutside of the remedial authority of the federal court in this specific litigation or any\nother similar litigation for that matter. See generally, 515 U.S. 70. Further, since the\nState was dismissed from this appeal by Judge Whipple's predecessor in 1997, a\ndecision that was affirmed by this court, Judge Heaney's disapproval is directed toward\na non-party and, perhaps, this court because it rejected several of his proposals on en\nbanc review many years ago. See Jenkins VIII, 959 F. Supp. 1295, aff'd, 122 F.3d 533;\nJenkins v. Missouri, 807 F.2d 657 (8th Cir. 1986) (en banc) (Jenkins I). Finally, Judge\nHeaney expresses disapproval of the actions of the suburban Kansas City schools and\nrefers to \"voluntary\" programs undertaken in St. Louis. However, his statement\nunderscores an important point–suburban Kansas City school districts, over Judge\nHeaney's objection, were specifically found to be free of constitutional violations and\nwere duly dismissed from this litigation. See Jenkins I, 807 F.2d at 672-73. On the\n\n\n\n                                           -27-\n\fother hand, St. Louis suburban schools, under threat of a finding of constitutional\ncomplicity by the Court of the Eastern District of Missouri, entered into a settlement\nagreement, enforceable by the district court, in which a program of state-funded inter-\ndistrict transfers were stipulated to and required. See Liddell v. Missouri, 731 F.2d\n1294, 1302-09 (8th Cir. 1984) (en banc).\n\n       Judge Heaney, in footnote 10, questions my taxing and spending figures for the\neducational operations of the KCMSD. First, he cites single-year figures for the 1998-\n1999 school year for three affluent suburbs of St. Louis and one small affluent district\nnear Kansas City, while I cite long-term average comparisons for KCMSD and the\nschool districts across Missouri. But, to consider the 1998-1999 school year with\nJudge Heaney, KCMSD spent $8,239 for school operations, excluding capital\nimprovements, while the surrounding suburban school districts spent an average of\n$5,834 per pupil. In general, no matter how you manipulate isolated figures, there is\nsimply no doubt that over the last fourteen years, KCMSD has spent substantially more\nper student per year than any other Missouri school district.\n\n      Judge Heaney also seems to misunderstand and, therefore, misapply my\ndiscussion of the two billion dollars estimate for the cost of the court's desegregation\nplan. He misses the point that the two billion dollars mentioned is for the desegregation\nplan alone and this amount is above and beyond the usual annual expenses for\neducational operations of KCMSD. Indeed, excluding capital expenditures, KCMSD\nhas had total operational expenditures of approximately one billion dollars since July\n1, 1997, alone. A very recent illustration of Judge Heaney's erroneous calculations can\nbe found in the record for operational expenditures by KCMSD from July 1, 1997,\nthrough June 30, 1999. The two years of expenditures, excluding capital\nimprovements, amounted to $679,196,524, or, $9,426 per student per year and the\nrecord establishes that per student costs for earlier years of the desegregation plan have\nalmost always equaled or exceeded these more recent figures. This is, of course, an\namount far different from Judge Heaney's fourteen-year unsupported calculation of\n$3,900 per pupil.\n\n      In a similar vein, Judge Heaney takes me to task for my accurate statement that\n\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\f       So after fifteen years, we are called upon to decide only one issue–whether the\ndistrict court was correct in dismissing this costly and seemingly endless case without\nholding an evidentiary hearing.15\n\n\n\neducational test scores have \"remained static or have declined\" during the life of the\ndesegregation plan. In rebuttal, he cites results from school year 1993-1994. What he\ndoes not note is that at the achievement gap hearing in 1997, Dr. William Trent, Judge\nClark's preferred expert, noted that some time during the 1994-1995 school year \"a new\ntest form\" with \"different scaling\" was used. See Transcript at 1289. Similar evidence\nis contained elsewhere in the record. I submit that such changes make year-to-year\ncomparisons problematic. However, without dispute, test scores experienced a steady\ndecline from the year cited by Judge Heaney until at least the end of the 1999 school\nyear. In any event, although changes occurred during this period, the beginning and\nending figures in my table are absolutely correct as is my conclusion that recurring\nITBS, TAP and MAP scores indicate that advances in educational achievement did not\noccur over time especially in the upper elementary grades and in high school.\n\n        Finally, Judge Heaney claims that my conclusions on racial isolation by school\nare misleading, and points to a short period of time when several schools dropped\nbelow a ninety percent minority level, the level above which the term \"racial isolation\"\nis definitionally applied. While he is correct for this limited period, he also admits that\ndue to changing neighborhood demographics and other unstated reasons, the number\nof racially isolated schools (i.e., ninety percent or higher minority population) has now\nreached the level I set forth in the body of my dissent. And, of course, he doesn't\nmention that, in part, this apparent resegregation is a result of a limitation on remedies\navailable to the federal court imposed by the Supreme Court in Jenkins III. Thus, my\nstatement that the Kansas City schools remain as racially segregated today as when the\nlitigation began is accurate.\n      15\n       The class contends the hearing held on January 7, 2000, was not sufficient\nbecause the KCMSD had the burden of proof on unitary status. However, burden of\n\n\n\n                                           -29-\n\f       I agree with Judge Loken that in 1997 both the district court and this court\nviolated the Supreme Court's mandate in Jenkins III by shifting the burden of proof on\nthe issue of whether an achievement gap is a vestige of a de jure segregated school\nsystem. I write separately only to emphasize that even if such an achievement gap can\nbe correctly viewed as a vestige of prior discrimination, the district court had more\nthan sufficient evidence in the record to rule that KCMSD had shouldered its burden\nof showing that it had eliminated the gap to the extent practicable. This entitled\nKCMSD to a determination of unitary status.\n\n       Unitary status (and final relief from court control) is achieved when the vestiges\nof prior discrimination have been eliminated \"to the extent practicable.\" Missouri v.\nJenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 102 (1995) (Jenkins III) (emphasis mine). The class now\nconcedes that the only remaining vestige in this case, if any, lies within a portion of a\nblack-white educational achievement gap that exists among the students of KCMSD.\n This theory was conceived by Dr. William Trent and adopted by the district court in\nJenkins VIII after a three-week-long hearing held to determine, in part, the State's\nmotion for unitary status of KCMSD. 959 F. Supp. at 1158.\n\n    As a threshold matter, I note that any evidence that such a vestige exists in\nKCMSD is dubious at best. Even a cursory examination of the bases for Dr. Trent's\n\n\n\nproof is only an issue if the evidence stands in equipoise. Additionally, a party with the\nburden of proof is, of course, allowed to rest on the record before the court in order to\nshoulder both its burden of production and persuasion. Further, it is odd that the\nbeneficiary of another party's burden, as the class is here, would have cause to\ncomplain, especially since an unfettered opportunity to rebut anything in the record\nthought persuasive to the district court was afforded the class by the court. If\nprocedural due process is the argument, under existing precedent, the class has been\nafforded more process than was due.\n\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\fopinions reveal them to be nothing more than guesses and speculation. This court's\nreliance on a black-white achievement gap to measure lingering effects of invidious\nsegregation runs contrary to the finding of every other Circuit Court that has considered\nthe issue. See United States v. City of Yonkers, 197 F.3d 41, 54-55 (2d Cir. 1999);\nPeople Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., 111 F.3d 528, 537-38 (7th Cir. 1997);\nCoalition to Save Our Children v. State Bd. of Educ., 90 F.3d 752, 776-77 (3d Cir.\n1996). In fact, Dr. Trent's testimony on this purported phenomenon was rejected by\nthe First Circuit. See Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790, 804 (1st Cir. 1998). Similar\nevidence based upon Dr. Trent's methodology was held inadmissible under Daubert\nstandards by the Seventh Circuit. See People Who Care, 111 F.3d at 537.\nNonetheless, this court clings to the claimed existence of such a vestige of\ndiscrimination.16\n\n\n      16\n         In footnote 6 of his opinion for the court and his separate concurrence, Judge\nJohn R. Gibson faults my concern for the merits of this case. Although Judge Gibson's\nformulation of the issue on appeal is slightly different than I have stated, ante at 8, we\nboth agree that the correctness of Judge Whipple's determination of the existence of\nunitary status in KCMSD is a component of the question at hand. It is my position that\nif KCMSD has reached unitary status, Judge Whipple should be affirmed. Thus, the\nmerits of the unitary status holding must be reviewed, and the entire record, not just\nthat developed on November 1 and 2, 1999, must be considered.\n\n       In spite of his panel opinion position that he continues to restate in substantial\npart en banc, Judge Gibson now purports to hinge reversal of Judge Whipple on his\nfailure to schedule and hold a hearing on the subject of unitary status. He cites United\nStates v. Board of School Commissioners, 128 F.3d 507 (7th Cir. 1997), an inapposite\ncase that actually cuts in the opposite direction, for the proposition that the class was\ndeprived of a \"constitutional guarantee\" of a unitary status hearing. Ante at 11. This\ndeprivation, he posits, requires a reversal and remand. Other than Board of School\nCommissioners, which unremarkably holds that you cannot impose more (rather than\nless as Judge Whipple proposes) requirements on a school district without notice and\n\n\n\n                                          -31-\n\fa hearing, Judge Gibson cites no authority for this newly minted constitutional\nguarantee. 128 F.3d at 512. I believe there is no such guarantee whether based upon\ndue process, equal protection or any other constitutional provision. Under the\nprocedures followed, the class was clearly afforded more due process than any apposite\nprecedent has ever required.\n\n      Judge Gibson also argues that the merits of Judge Clark's 1997 decision, finding\na purported vestige of prior discrimination wrapped up in an achievement gap, are\nbeyond consideration by the court en banc. This argument is apparently based upon\na \"law of the case\" theory. Again, he cites no precedent for this proposition and\nindeed, the argument turns law of the case principles upside down. This is especially\ntrue when the court en banc is considering, as here, a previously unreviewed panel\nopinion for the first time. See Irving v. United States, 162 F.3d 154, 161 (1st Cir.\n1998). And, as Judge Gibson himself stated in Liddell \"the court en banc should\nattempt to decide the case correctly rather than consistently.\" 731 F.2d at 1331.\n\n       In 1997, Judge Clark and the panel erroneously disregarded Supreme Court\ndirections concerning burdens of proof and other substantive mandates. Beyond that,\nthere was, as noted in Judge Loken's dissent, a total failure to establish a vestige of\ndiscrimination \"traceable, in a proximate way, to [a] prior [constitutional] violation.\"\nFreeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 494 (1992). There was simply nothing offered to\nJudge Clark beyond speculation and conjecture, and, as cataloged in the body of my\ndissent, every court that has been approached with this theory has rejected it out of\nhand.\n\n      Finally, Judge Gibson seems to misunderstand my concern that the panel's\naffirmance of Judge Clark's achievement gap vestige flies directly in the face of the\nSupreme Court's mandate in Jenkins III. My point is that not only does Green v.\nCounty School Board of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430 (1968), omit student\nachievement as a factor for consideration for unitary status, Jenkins III specifically\nexcludes this factor because it is controlled, as the Supreme Court noted, by\ncircumstances wholly independent of unlawful discrimination. Jenkins III, 515 U.S.\nat 100-02. Every other circuit asked to consider any manifestation of scholastic\n\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\f        Contrary to the court's position in Jenkins v. Missouri, 122 F.3d 588 (8th Cir.\n1997), Jenkins III does not authorize a purported achievement gap as a vestige.\nAlthough not an exhaustive list of the vestiges of discrimination, student achievement\nis not among the six factors17 required for unitary status under Green v. County School\nBd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430 (1968). In fact, raising a red flag on the\nproblematic nature of an achievement gap as a factor, the Supreme Court noted that\nmany \"demographic changes independent\" of de jure segregation could contribute to\na gap. Jenkins III, 515 U.S. at 102. The Court stated \"[i]nsistence upon academic\ngoals unrelated to the effects of legal segregation unwarrantably postpones the day\nwhen the KCMSD will be able to operate on its own.\" Id.\n\n       The frailty of an achievement gap as a vestige is dramatized by the testimony of\ntwo of the educational experts heard at the January 1997 unitary status hearing–Dr.\nTrent and Dr. David Armor.18 Both experts acknowledged that a gap exists nationwide,\n(Transcript at 1391-92 [Trent]) (Transcript at 437 [Armor]) and Dr. Armor pointed out\nthe gap in Kansas City was lower than the national average gap and lower than the gap\n\n\nachievement as a vestige factor has agreed with this interpretation of Jenkins III and\nrejected the proposition. See United States v. City of Yonkers, 197 F.3d 41, 54-55 (2d\nCir. 1999); People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., 111 F.3d 528, 537-38 (7th Cir.\n1997); Coalition to Save Our Children v. State Bd. of Educ., 90 F.3d 752, 776-77 (3d\nCir. 1996).\n       17\n        The factors are student assignments, transportation, physical facilities,\nextracurricular activities, faculty assignments, and resource allocation.\n       18\n         Additionally, it seems inconceivable that this court validated the district court's\nfinding that KCMSD was liable for a portion of an achievement gap that existed even\nbefore the children entered the school system. See Jenkins VIII, 959 F. Supp. at 1164-\n65. But, it did.\n\n\n\n                                           -33-\n\fin suburban schools surrounding KCMSD. Transcript at 499 & 502-03. Many of the\nother schools with a similar or greater gap have never been found guilty of race\ndiscrimination of any sort. Id. at 502-03. Indeed, this court has determined the\nsuburban Kansas City Schools were discrimination free. See generally Missouri v.\nJenkins, 807 F.2d 657 (8th Cir. 1986) (en banc).\n\n       Assuming, for the sake of discussion, that the achievement gap is a vestige of\ndiscrimination, I turn to the unsupportable position of the class and the court on how\nto narrow the gap. KCMSD has identified five areas that supposedly contribute to low\nachievement by its minority students. These areas are (1) expectations by teachers; (2)\nlack of a core curriculum; (3) ineffective staff development; (4) lack of a\ncomprehensive assessment system; and (5) the absence of accountability at all levels.\nKCMSD created, and had the court approve, five plans to address these factors\n(classroom practices, professional development, assessment, accountability, and\ncurriculum). Each of these plans is now purportedly at a different stage of its\nimplementation, ranging from nearly complete to barely underway.19 All parties\n\n\n      19\n         The class, the court and Judges Heaney and Gibson in their concurrences\nconcentrate solely upon the KCMSD educational programs purportedly developed and\nimplemented (or in process of implementation) since Judge Clark's and the panel's\nadoption of an achievement gap vestige in 1997. However, the record available to\nJudge Whipple shows that the 1985 KCMSD remedial plan, formulated by Judge Clark\nand approved by the panel, was designed to achieve \"results more in keeping with\nnational norms,\" with reading skills at such national norms to be achieved within four\nor five years, and was similar if not almost identical, with one exception, to the present\nset of plans touted by the class and insisted upon by the panel in its now vacated\nopinion.

The class also concedes the\nremaining obstacle to unitary status is the implementation of the plans to a\n\"satisfactory\" level, whatever that may be. However, there is a more fundamental\nproblem.\n\n      The undisputed evidence offered at the 1997 hearing shows that non-minority\nand minority students respond equally to effective teaching and innovative educational\n\n\n\n\n             school desegregation.\n\nJenkins v.

The only current plan that does\nnot appear to have something equivalent in the 1985 order is the assessment plan. That\nplan, however, is the one that all the parties now agree is fully implemented.\n\n       Although the current plans are now advanced as new and necessary for the\neducational progress needed to close the achievement gap in KCMSD, they really are,\nas philosopher Yogi Berra might have said, \" déjà vu all over again.\" Although Jenkins\nIII now indicates that this grandiose 1985 program was well beyond the remedial\nauthority of the federal court, its establishment and vigorous implementation, at\nunparalleled cost to taxpayers, amply proves that KCMSD has now done everything\n\"practicable\" to achieve unitary status. Victory should be declared and the case should\nnow be dismissed.\n\n\n\n                                         -36-\n\ftechniques.20 Transcript at 1411-12 (Trent), Transcript at 498 (Armor) and Transcript\nat 271 (Dr. Christine Rossell). The implemented and to-be-implemented programs at\nKCMSD will, according to the testimony, raise the test scores of all KCMSD students\nwithout regard to race. This laudable and sought after educational result occurs\nbecause, as the Supreme Court noted in Jenkins III, a \"rising tide lifts all boats.\"\nJenkins III, 515 U.S. at 102. In other words, under the current plan all KCMSD\nstudents will improve at the same rate in normalized curve equivalents (NCEs). Clearly\nthen, the evidence shows that the presently approved court educational plan, by itself,\nwill not impact the achievement gap. Without influence from factors well beyond the\ncontrol of KCMSD, the approach now championed by the class and the court will only\nserve to make the goal unattainable. In short, when the gap is eliminated, if it ever is,\nit will not be because of federal court supervision of curriculum and classroom\ninstruction. It will be because of societal changes that are not achievable through use\nof the remedial power and authority of the federal courts.21\n\n       Accordingly, the proposed use of an achievement gap to measure lingering\ndiscrimination is a misconceived idea, and use of it will never allow KCMSD to reach\na \"satisfactory\" level in the eyes of the class and, perhaps, some members of this court.\nUnder this scenario, federal court supervision will continue for, perhaps, another\n\n\n\n\n      20\n        There is also evidence that higher achieving students will respond better to\nthese new techniques widening the gap even further. (Trent, Transcript at 1411-12).\n      21\n         The court's opinion refers to \"[t]he Jenkins class, representing the children of\nthe Kansas City, Missouri School District.\" Ante at 3. Under the evidence of this case,\nand the current vestige arguments being advanced by the class, it is, in my view, almost\ncertain that the class does not now represent the interests of all of the children of\nKCMSD.\n\n\n\n                                          -37-\n\ftwenty-three years. This, of course, is not a lawful application of the clear mandates\nof the Supreme Court in Jenkins III.\n\n       Even if the plans adopted by the court could conceivably close the achievement\ngap, KCMSD has fulfilled its constitutional obligations to remedy the discrimination\nto the extent practicable. Under this contingency, the issue before the court is whether\nthe plans have been implemented satisfactorily. The district court's November 1-2,\n1999, hearing and the January 7, 2000, hearing demonstrate that they have been. After\nthe November hearing, the district court found the State's accreditation process is: \"(1)\nbased on standards that are fully consistent with the Court's desegregation orders; (2)\nan attempt to infuse accountability in the KCMSD that is fully consistent with the\nCourt's desegregation orders; and (3) unlikely to engender the high degree of negative\nconsequences that could prevent compliance with the United States Constitution.\"\nJenkins X, 73 F. Supp. 2d at 1077.\n\n       These holdings have not been appealed by any of the parties. And, if they have\nbeen, they are clearly supported by the record. The court heard testimony from Dr.\nMarilou Joyner of Missouri's Department of Elementary and Secondary Education,\nwhich is responsible for evaluating the school district and making recommendations\nabout accreditation. Dr. Joyner testified that all five of the court-approved plans\nconform to state accreditation requirements. Additionally, KCMSD offered evidence\nand neither the class nor the court has disputed the showing that it was firmly\ncommitted to continue with the implementation of the plans approved by the district\ncourt as the best way to meet the state standards–a necessary step to avoid eventual\nimplementation of the de-accreditation threat.\n\n       In Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467 (1992), the Supreme Court stated that one of\nthe factors that should inform the court's discretion in deciding unitary status was\n\n\n\n\n                                          -38-\n\f\"whether retention of judicial control is necessary or practicable to achieve compliance\nwith the decree.\" Id. at 491. Additionally, as we have said in other discrimination\ncases, when a state takes independent action that will address the court's remedial\nconcerns, the court should step aside. See Liddell v. Special Sch. Dist., 149 F.3d 862,\n870-71 (8th Cir. 1998). These findings make it clear the district court's presence in the\nlitigation is no longer necessary to achieve constitutional objectives and the State has\nadequately addressed the court's remaining remedial concerns. As a result, the district\ncourt was correct in finding that unitary status had been achieved.\n\n        In an effort to dodge or obfuscate the real issues of the case, the class, as earlier\nindicated, complains that it was a violation of due process and reversible error for the\ncourt to dismiss the case without holding a previously contemplated and announced\nevidentiary hearing.22 This argument is specious and is not supported by the law of\nthis or any other circuit. At the remedy stage of a school desegregation case, the\ndistrict court proceeds under its equitable authority, controlling the outcome of the\nlitigation with a series of injunction-like orders. This court, in past opinions in this\ncase, has described the broad and continuing equitable authority of the district court as\n\"'characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a facility for\nadjusting and reconciling public and private needs.' Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267,\n288 (1977) (quoting Brown v. Board of Educ., 349 U.S. 294, 300 (1955)).\" Jenkins\nXIV, 122 F.3d at 600; see also Jenkins v. Missouri, 931 F.2d 470, 482 (8th Cir. 1991).\n\n        Furthermore, an evidentiary hearing was not required, as the district court had\nall the requisite evidence before it for making a reasoned determination. In particular,\na district court may take such action if the court sees that the underlying factual or legal\n\n\n       22\n        It is true, as the court sets forth, that there were discussions of a January 3,\n2000, hearing on July 19, 1999, August 24, 1999, and August 26, 1999.\n\n\n\n                                            -39-\n\fissues have changed. See United States v. Texas, 158 F.3d 299, 312 (5th Cir. 1998);\nAlberti v. Klevenhagen, 46 F.3d 1347, 1366 (5th Cir. 1995); United States v. City of\nMiami, 2 F.3d 1497, 1506 (11th Cir. 1993). '\"Sound judicial discretion may call for the\nmodification of the terms of an injunctive decree if the circumstances, whether of law\nor fact, obtaining at the time of its issuance have changed, or new ones have since\narisen.'\" Rufo v. Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail, 520 U.S. 367, 380 (1992) (quoting\nRailway Employees v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 647 (1961)). Such circumstances have\nobviously arisen in this case.\n\n       On October 21, 1999, well after the court's discussions of a potential January 3,\n2000, hearing, a major event changed the nature and scope of this litigation. The\nMissouri State Board of Education voted to withdraw educational accreditation of\nKCMSD as of May 1, 2000, and insert itself into the educational picture in Kansas\nCity. As a result of the State's action, the KCMSD quickly made a motion in the\ndistrict court to have this action declared void ab initio. The district court responded\nimmediately and held the evidentiary hearing of November 1 and 2, 1999.\n\n        The State's appearance through the accreditation process dramatically altered the\nlandscape of the litigation. With court-approved plans and State requirements in\naccord, one with the other, as earlier noted, every item of evidence necessary to\ndetermine unitary status was in place before the district court. Thus, the court's unitary\nstatus holding, based upon the entire record, was clearly correct. An educational gap\nthat purportedly represents a vestige of long eliminated de jure segregation has not\nbeen established and even if it has been, with currently approved educational programs,\nit will not be and, indeed, cannot be mitigated, much less eradicated. The idea that\nKCMSD has now, after twenty-three years, done everything practicable to \"remedy the\n[earlier] violation to the extent practicable,\" is not clearly erroneous–it is clearly\n\n\n\n\n                                          -40-\n\fcorrect. For the court to have held otherwise on this record would have been an abuse\nof discretion.\n\n       All current requirements being imposed by this litigation extend well beyond any\nlawful remedies for violations of distant acts of de jure segregation. And, this case is\nnot about a federal district judge who made a procedural mistake by not holding yet\nanother evidentiary hearing entailing countless thousands of additional taxpayer dollars\nfor court time, staff time, attorney fees and expert witnesses. It is about matters that\na federal court no longer has a legitimate right to involve itself in.\n\n       It is long past the time to follow the admonition of the Supreme Court in Jenkins\nIII and '\"restore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that is\n[now] operating in compliance with the Constitution.\"' 515 U.S. at 101 (quoting\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 489). \"Returning schools to the control of local authorities at the\nearliest practicable date is essential to restore their true accountability in our\ngovernmental system.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490.\n\n      The KCMSD is unitary. I would affirm the district court.23\n\n\n      23\n         Since the court seems bent upon an alternate course, it is proper to make one\nadditional observation. The court in its footnote 6 states that it finds it unnecessary to\ndiscuss the merits of Judge Whipple's order concerning unitary status. Although not\nexplicitly stated, this is presumably because the only issue reached by a majority of the\ncourt en banc is whether an evidentiary hearing should have been conducted by Judge\nWhipple prior to his decision, So, in my view, footnote 6, Chief Judge Wollman's\nconcurrence joined by Judge Morris Sheppard Arnold and this dissent should be a clear\nsignal to Judge Whipple that he is now free to set a hearing date that accommodates a\nreasonable preparation period for the parties and to then hear and decide the unitary\nstatus of KCMSD free and clear of any verbiage contained in the panel opinion which\nwas vacated by the grant of en banc consideration in this case.\n\n\n\n                                          -41-\n\f                               ADDENDUM\n\n          IOWA

In Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70 (1995) (Jenkins III),\nthe Supreme Court held that much of the remedy imposed by the district court and\nupheld by a panel of this court went beyond the permissible bounds of an equitable\nschool desegregation decree. The Court defined the scope of an appropriate remedy:\n\n      the proper response by the District Court should have been to eliminate\n      to the extent practicable the vestiges of prior de jure segregation within\n      the KCMSD: a systemwide reduction in student achievement and the\n      existence of 25 racially identifiable schools with a population of over 90%\n      black students.\n\n515 U.S. at 90. Among the remedial measures the Court reversed was a mandate to\nfund “quality education programs.” In rejecting this court’s attempt to fill in the gaps\nin the district court’s analysis of that issue, the Supreme Court cautioned:\n\n      Although the District Court has determined that “[s]egregation has caused\n      a system wide reduction in achievements in the schools of the KCMSD,”\n      639 F. Supp., at 24, it never has identified the incremental effect that\n      segregation has had on minority student achievement or the specific goals\n      of the quality education programs.\n\n515 U.S. at 101 (emphasis in original). The Court remanded, instructing the district\ncourt “that its end purpose is not only ‘to remedy the violation’ to the extent\npracticable, but also ‘to restore state and local authorities to the control of a school\n\n\n\n\n                                         -45-\n\fsystem that is operating in compliance with the Constitution.’” Id. at 102, quoting\nFreeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 489 (1992).\n\n       On remand, the district court took up the question of an alleged achievement gap\nbetween black and white students in the KCMSD. Its prior findings as to vestiges --\nas determined by the Supreme Court -- were limited to finding a systemwide reduction\nin student achievement. Yet the district court on remand did not make the critical\nfinding that any achievement gap among students within the KCMSD was also a\nvestige of discrimination with “a causal link to the de jure violation being remedied.”\nJenkins III, 515 U.S. at 96. Instead, the district court held that “the plaintiffs are\nentitled to the presumption that current disparities are causally related to prior\nsegregation, and the burden of proving otherwise rests on the defendants.” Jenkins v.\nMissouri, 959 F. Supp. 1151, 1157 (W.D. Mo. 1997). Having ducked the critical\ncausation question, the district court proceeded to quantify a present “race effect” of\n2.6 normalized curve equivalents (NCEs) and order that it be remedied. A panel of this\ncourt again affirmed. Jenkins v. Missouri, 122 F.3d 588 (8th Cir. 1997).24\n\n       In my view, the district court and this court violated the Supreme Court’s law of\nthe case by deciding in 1997 to presume that a present-day achievement gap is a\nvestige of the de jure segregated school system maintained under Missouri law prior\nto 1954. The result of shifting the burden of proof was to place on KCMSD the\nimpossible burden of proving that no part of the present-day gap -- which ironically is\nsignificantly less in Kansas City than the national norm, see 959 F. Supp. at 1158 --\n\n\n      24\n         The order to close the achievement gap by 2.6 NCEs effectively ignored the\ndistaste expressed by all nine Justices for decrees that require a certain level of\nstatistical performance on standardized tests before unitary status can be found. See\nJenkins III, 515 U.S. at 101-02; id. at 148-49 (Souter, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\n                                         -46-\n\fis causally linked to de jure segregation in the distant past. See Coalition to Save Our\nChildren v. Board of Educ., 90 F.3d 752, 776-77 (3d Cir. 1996); see also Freeman v.\nPitts, 503 U.S. 467, 503-06 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring).25 The Supreme Court has\nonly placed this burden of proof on defendants when resolving claims that lingering\nsegregation or racial imbalance were vestiges of de jure segregation.26 Even in those\ncases, the Court has stated that the causal presumption diminishes “[a]s the de jure\nviolation becomes more remote in time.” Freeman, 503 U.S. at 496; see id. at 503-06\n(Scalia, J., concurring); Jenkins III, 515 U.S. at 118 (Thomas, J., concurring).\n\n      By shifting the burden of proof on an ancillary issue such as student\nachievement, the district court created a regime of federal court supervision that will\nseemingly never end. The case was then assigned to a new district judge, who\nrecognized that the achievement gap mandate, improperly imposed by his predecessor\nand this court some three years ago, frustrates the Supreme Court’s directive to\n\n\n\n      25\n         The district court based its finding of a 2.6-NCE quantitative gap on expert\nopinion evidence that was likely inadmissible under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms.,\nInc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). See People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., 111 F.3d\n528, 534, 537-38 (7th Cir. 1997). In any event, that evidence wholly failed to establish\nthat any race-related portion of the achievement gap was caused by the prior de\njure segregation. See United States v. City of Yonkers, 197 F.3d 41, 54-55 (2d Cir.\n1999), cert. denied, --- S. Ct. ---, 68 U.S.L.W. 3536 (May 22, 2000). “The vestiges\nof segregation that are the concern of the law in a school case may be subtle and\nintangible but nonetheless they must be so real that they have a causal link to the de\njure violation being remedied.” Jenkins III, 515 U.S. at 96.\n      26\n        See United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 738-39 (1992); Freeman, 503 U.S.\nat 494; Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 526, 537 (1979); Keyes v. School\nDist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 209-10 (1973); Swann v.

Sadly, this court now decides to\nperpetuate its disregard for the Supreme Court’s instructions in Jenkins III by requiring\nmore open-ended litigation over whether KCMSD has complied with an order to\nremedy a present-day condition that has never been proved to be a vestige of prior de\njure segregation.

The order followed\na hearing set by the court to consider KCMSD's amended motion for equitable relief\nfrom a ruling of the Missouri State Board of Education declaring that the accreditation\nof KCMSD would be withdrawn effective May 1, 2000. After the district court denied\nKCMSD's motion, it proceeded sua sponte to a discussion of the unitary status of the\ndistrict and declared the district to be unitary.

After receiving additional filings from the parties and\nhearing argument, we reverse and remand.\n\n       We need not discuss in detail the long history of the Kansas City school\ndesegregation litigation. After a finding of constitutional violations, years of effort to\nremedy them, and extended litigation and appeals which we need not catalog, the State\nof Missouri moved for a declaration of unitary status. On March 27, 1997, Judge\nRussell Clark, who had presided over the case since its filing, granted the motion in part,\nbut denied it in part. See Jenkins v. Missouri, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In particular, Judge Clark held that twenty-six\npercent of the achievement gap of ten normalized curve equivalents between KCMSD's\nblack and white students was a vestige of the constitutional violation, and he ordered\nKCMSD to take reasonable steps to eradicate that vestige within the next three years.\nId. at 1157-65, 1179. At the same time, Judge Clark approved a settlement between\nKCMSD and the State, providing that the State would pay KCMSD $320 million over\nthree years, and in return, would be dismissed from the litigation. Id. at 1180.\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f        On January 28, 1999, the district judge who succeeded Judge Clark to\nsupervision of the case entered an order declaring that the State had paid its obligation\nunder the settlement and dismissing the State from the case. Order of January 28, 1999.\nThe court said that the State must continue to comply with any obligations that it\nundertook during the course of the lawsuit that were not covered by the agreement and\nwarned the State against taking any action that might prevent KCMSD from ultimately\nfulfilling its court-ordered remedial goals. Id. at 6. The court then pointed to Judge\nClark's order giving KCMSD three years to eliminate all the remaining vestiges of\nsegregation; the court commented that fifteen months remained on this time line. Id.\nAfter considering the \"lengthy and litigious process\" likely to attend a renewed motion\nfor unitary status, the court directed the parties to prepare for a unitary status hearing\nto begin on January 3, 2000. Id.\n\n       When KCMSD had hired its new superintendent, Benjamin Demps, the district\njudge, at a hearing on July 19, 1999, told Mr. Demps that a unitary status hearing was\nset for January 3.\n\n       Counsel appeared before the court on August 24, 1999 for a scheduling\nconference, which the court stated was \"to address . . . preparing for a unitary status\nhearing in January,\" and in particular, what evidence the parties anticipated presenting\nin the hearing. Counsel for the class suggested delaying the hearing. He said that it\nwould be difficult for KCMSD to make a case that everything practicable had been\ndone, because there was a \"pretty widely shared agreement that this is not the case.\"\nFurthermore, some test data were not in, and others seemed to show the achievement\ngap had not been closed. Nor had KCMSD implemented the curriculum, professional\ndevelopment, and accountability plans designed to close the gap. Also, KCMSD had\njust hired a new superintendent. The class's counsel suggested a hearing in the late\nsummer of 2000.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f       The court then pointed to Judge Clark's statement that gave the district three years\nto eliminate the vestiges of discrimination. The court stated he \"believed the Supreme\nCourt when they told me to get this school district returned to local control\" and that\nboth he and Judge Clark had given KCMSD three years to comply.\n\n       Counsel for the class pointed out that recently the monitoring had been less\nheavy-handed, and that the monitoring committee, which was commonly referred to as\nthe DMC, had been sending things back to the new superintendent to handle. Counsel\nsaid there were many ways the committee could lighten its monitoring. Counsel for the\nclass stated that he did not anticipate that he would be presenting new approaches or\nanything other than implementation of the five programs already planned for reducing\nthe black-white achievement gap: the curriculum, classroom practices, professional\ndevelopment, assessment, and accountability plans.\n\n       The district court then stated that he sensed that both the class and KCMSD were\n\"pretty satisfied that the school district can't . . . go forward with the burden of proof that\nthe gap has narrowed.\"1 He said he would need to have a hearing to take testimony\nfrom one of the experts who testified at the earlier unitariness hearing and also to hear\nwhether the district was \"on track\" in implementing the five programs. The court\ncommented that the problem had been the delay in implementation of the five plans to\nreduce the achievement gap. The court further commented that the track record of the\ndistrict had not convinced him that KCMSD was putting heart and soul behind\nimplementing the five plans or that KCMSD could get out of the political mode and get\ninto looking after the best interests of the children.\n\n       1\n        This statement came after the following exchange. When the class counsel said\nin court there was \"widely shared agreement\" that KCMSD had not done everything\npracticable to eradicate the achievement gap, KCMSD did not object to this\nrepresentation. KCMSD's counsel said: \"[W]e have a sense at the moment . . . that\nthe district would have an uphill fight in January.\"\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\f      Following this conference, the court filed a written order formally denying the\nmotion for a continuance, stating:\n\n      [T]he Court provided for termination of the [DMC] by March 25, 2000.\n      See Order at 21, Doc. # 4575 (August 21, 1997), . . . . [E]ven if the\n      KCMSD has not attained unitary status, all three Monitors would be\n      removed. See id. At that time, the Court would need to determine the\n      need for new Monitors or even a new remedial structure. Such a\n      determination cannot be made without evidence of the KCMSD's current\n      status.\n\n             ....\n\n            . . . The [unitary status] hearing will begin, as scheduled, on January\n      3, 2000.\n\nOrder of August 26, 1999 at 17-18 (emphasis added).\n\n      On October 21, 1999, the State Board of Education voted to withdraw\naccreditation of KCMSD as of May 1, 2000. In response, KCMSD filed an amended\nmotion for equitable relief on October 25, 1999, seeking to bar the State's action on the\nground that it would interfere with the remedial decree in Jenkins.2 That same day, the\ncourt issued an order setting KCMSD's motion for hearing on November 1 to hear\nevidence on three enumerated issues: whether the court should (1) rejoin the State as\na party; (2) declare void ab initio the action of the Missouri State Board of Education\nin classifying KCMSD as an unaccredited school district; and (3) enjoin the application\nto KCMSD of several statutes on which the State Board's action was based.\n\n\n\n      2\n       In KCMSD's motion for relief from the de-accreditation action, it asked the\ncourt to stay the de-accreditation until the five remedial plans had been fully\nimplemented.\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f        The court held the hearing on KCMSD's motion on November 1-2, 1999. We\nneed not discuss in detail the testimony before the court, except to state that it was\ndirected to the issues outlined by the district court in its order of October 25. The\nparties agreed in oral argument before the panel that the hearing was not a unitary status\nhearing. At the conclusion of the proceedings of November 2, the court asked\nKCMSD's staff counsel whether the KCMSD board agreed there should be a unitary\nstatus hearing in January. Counsel stated that the board voted unanimously to seek a\ncontinuance and authorized her to agree to a continuation of the monitoring committee\nin its current configuration until the end of the 1999-2000 academic year in June.\n\n       On November 9, 1999, KCMSD filed a written motion requesting a continuance\nof the unitary status hearing set for January 3, 2000, and consenting to continued\nsupervision by the DMC. KCMSD further suggested that it would be appropriate to\nextend the term limits of the DMC beyond March 25, 2000, and to set a hearing at the\nend of the academic school year, June 3, 2000, to assess the role of the DMC and\nconsider a reduction in the scope of the oversight by that body in the future.\n\n       On November 17 the district court issued an order denying KCMSD's request to\nrejoin the State as a party and refusing to declare void ab initio the action of the State\nBoard of Education classifying KCMSD as an unaccredited school district.3 After ruling\non the motion before it, the court proceeded sua sponte to consider the issue of whether\nthe district was unitary. In light of the nature of our ruling, it is not necessary that we\nset out in detail the substance of the court's reasoning. Suffice it to say that, much to the\nparties' surprise, the court ended by declaring that the KCMSD had achieved unitary\nstatus. The court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\n\n       3\n       The action of the State Board of Education was effective May 1, 2000.\nKCMSD has two years in which to regain accreditation and, if it does not, further\nserious consequences, including dissolution of the district, may follow.\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\f                                           I.\n\n       The issue before us is whether the district court erred in determining KCMSD to\nbe unitary and dismissing the case without taking evidence or hearing arguments.\n\n       In January 1999 the court scheduled a hearing on unitary status for January 2000,\nand both in a conference with counsel and a written order in August 1999 commented\nspecifically on the necessity for a hearing to evaluate what continuing judicial\ninvolvement would be required. The order setting the November 1-2, 1999 hearing\nlimited that hearing to the issues of whether the State should be rejoined as a party and\nwhether the de-accreditation order should be declared void ab initio. The transcript\ndiscloses that the testimony and evidence at the hearing were directed to these issues.\nThe court's inquiry at the conclusion of the November 1-2 hearing as to whether there\nshould be a unitary status hearing in January demonstrates that the court did not consider\nit had conducted such a hearing. KCMSD's counsel's response to this inquiry by the\ncourt and its written motion filed November 9, 1999 for a continuance of the unitariness\nhearing demonstrate that KCMSD did not consider that there had been a hearing on\nunitary status.\n\n       It is evident from what we have said above that KCMSD did nothing to contest\nthe Jenkins class's statements that KCMSD was not ready to move forward and\nestablish that KCMSD was unitary, and the judge acknowledged as much. From this\nand from the court's order limiting the proof at the November 1-2 hearing, the Jenkins\nclass as well as KCMSD went into the hearing with no expectation that unitary status\nwas an issue to be tried.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\f       In Jenkins XIV we held, based upon abundant Supreme Court authority, that once\nthere has been a finding that a defendant established an unlawful dual school system in\nthe past, there is a presumption that current disparities of the sort listed in Green v.\nCounty School Board, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 435 (1968), are the result of the defendant's\nunconstitutional conduct. See Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 593. Therefore, the burden of\nproving unitariness rests on the constitutional violator. Id. at 593-95. Our statement in\nJenkins XIV found support in Freeman v. Pitts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494 (1992), where the\nSupreme Court stated with respect to racial imbalance in student attendance caused by\nthe unlawful policy of a school system, \"The School District bears the burden of\nshowing that any current imbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to the prior\nviolation.\" Other statements in Freeman similarly recognized that the burden was on the\ndistrict to demonstrate a good faith commitment to compliance with the desegregation\nplan. Id. at 498-99. This presumption places the burden in any hearing on unitary status\non KCMSD, including the issue of reduction in student achievement and the\nachievement gap. KCMSD admittedly made no attempt to demonstrate that unitary\nstatus had been achieved.4\n\n\n      4\n       In Jenkins XIV, we pointed to the finding of the district court in the first\nremedial order decisions that \"the inferior education indigenous of the state-compelled\ndual school system has lingering effects in the Kansas City, Missouri School District.\"\n122 F.3d at 594 (quoting Jenkins v.

The Seventh\nCircuit, in an opinion by Chief Judge Posner, stated:\n\n       No one asked the judge for this modification; there was no hearing on it.\n       As a result, there is nothing in the judge's order, or in the record on which\n       it is based, about the respective kindergarten programs, facilities, and\n       capacities in the transferor and transferee areas or about the\n       appropriateness of compelling the busing of such young children against\n       their parents' wishes and whether they are to be in the same buses with\n       much older children.\n\n128 F.3d at 512. In support of the court's order that they, like KCMSD here, did not\nseek in the first place, the appellees pointed out that the district judge had \"learned a\nlot about public school education in Marion County in the thirty years that he has been\npresiding over this litigation.\" Id. The Seventh Circuit responded:\n\n\n       5\n        The Seventh Circuit's opinion stated that a district wanting to phase out a\ndesegregation decree could be permitted to do so only upon presenting evidence that\nthe existing order had outlived its usefulness. See 128 F.3d at 510.\n\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\f       [G]reat knowledge is a temptation as well as a resource: a temptation to\n       blur the separation of powers, to shift the balance between the federal\n       courts and state and local government too far toward the courts, and to\n       disregard procedural niceties, all in fulfillment of a confident sense of\n       mission.\n\nId.\n\n      Although the Seventh Circuit was dealing with expansion of a remedy and we\ndeal with the elimination of one, the principle is the same: procedural niceties equate\nwith due process and must be afforded the parties. As the Seventh Circuit vacated the\nsua sponte order and remanded for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing, so\nshould we.\n\n       The parties are entitled to notice and an opportunity to prepare for a unitary status\nhearing. KCMSD would carry the burden of proof at such a hearing, and the Jenkins\nclass would be entitled to an opportunity to respond. Due process of law requires no\nless. The sua sponte ruling of the district court, in spite of its several earlier orders\nsetting the unitary status hearing some two months later, deprived the Jenkins Class of\nthis constitutional guarantee.\n\n        Counsel for KCMSD conceded that the court's ruling was on a ground not argued\nby the parties, but insisted that the court was thinking ahead of KCMSD. Having\nachieved its unexpected release from litigation, KCMSD hastens to give support to the\nruling.\n\n      KCMSD argues that the district court did not err in declaring KCMSD unitary\nwithout benefit of notice, hearing, argument, or other evidentiary presentation.\nKCMSD cites Link v. Wabash Railroad Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106449\"><a href=\"/opinion/106449/link-v-wabash-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1962), for the principle that\n\n\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f\"Parties are not always entitled to a hearing.\" Link has little, if any, relevance to this\ncase. In Link, the district court set a pretrial conference and notified counsel. When\nthe lawyer for the plaintiff did not appear at the time set, the court dismissed the action\nfor failure to appear and failure to prosecute. Id. at 629. Link did no more than rule\nthat the dismissal for failure to prosecute was not an abuse of discretion. Id. at 633.\n\n        Link is about sanctions, not about what opportunity parties should be given to\npresent evidence and make argument before a ruling on the merits of their case. It\ncertainly is not about the proper procedure for dismissal of a school desegregation case\nin which a school district has been adjudged liable for constitutional violations and\nsubjected to a remedial decree. However, Link does have some general applicability\nto this case insofar as it discussed the circumstances that can justify entry of an order\nwithout the opportunity to be heard: \"The adequacy of notice and hearing respecting\nproceedings that may affect a party's rights turns, to a considerable extent, on the\nknowledge which the circumstances show such party may be taken to have of the\nconsequences of his own conduct.\" 370 U.S. at 332. Unlike Link, where the attorney\nhad notice of the pretrial conference and should have known that his failure to appear\nwould have consequences, in this case there was no notice to any of the parties, either\nconstitutional violator or victims, that the issue of unitary status was to be considered\nand decided at the November hearing. To the contrary, there was every assurance that\nunitary status would not be considered until the scheduled January 2000 hearing, and\nKCMSD's requests for continuance strongly suggested that it would not even be in a\nposition to contend that the district was unitary in January 2000. Link demonstrates\nthat simple fairness requires notice and hearing before a decision that dismisses the\ncase.\n\n      At oral argument, KCMSD's counsel suggested that the Jenkins class had the\nopportunity to present evidence on the unitariness question at the hearing on the class's\n\n\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fmotion to stay the dismissal pending appeal. The opportunity to argue a stay motion,\nwith the class having the burden on four discrete issues, which placed the constitutional\nvictims in the position of arguing that the horse should be put back in the barn, does not\nsubstitute for a chance to present evidence and argue the merits in a hearing called for\nthe purpose of determining unitariness.\n\n       The sua sponte ruling declaring the district unitary and releasing the admitted\nconstitutional violator from further court supervision, without giving notice either to the\nconstitutional violator or the victims or permitting the parties to present evidence and\nargue these issues, was error.6\n\n                                            II.\n\n       The Jenkins class, through its counsel, informed the district court and conceded\nto this court that the issues in the case had come down to implementation of the five\nplans (classroom practices, professional development, assessment, accountability and\ncurriculum) crafted to improve student achievement and eliminate the achievement gap\nbetween white and black students. Counsel conceded to us, as well as to the district\ncourt, that when these five plans have been implemented satisfactorily, he will have no\nfurther plans to suggest. The remaining issues have been thus narrowed.\n\n\n      6\n         The court has not found it necessary today to reach the merits of the district\ncourt's order. Both dissents, however, are focused on the merits of the case, and almost\nexclusively on the 1997 opinions of the district court and this court, Jenkins v.\nMissouri, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

After the decision in Jenkins XIV, none of the parties asked for rehearing or\nfiled a petition for certiorari. The parties before us have not raised the issues discussed\nin the dissents. Indeed, both parties have accepted Jenkins XIV as the standard under\nwhich the unitary status issue must be considered.\n\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\f        The panel ordered that on remand the judges of the Western District of Missouri\nshould assign this case to another district judge. 205 F.3d at 370. KCMSD objects to\nthe reassignment order and argues that it was improperly entered. Eight of the judges\nof this court have determined that the court should not order reassignment on remand.7\n\n     We reverse and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\nThe mandate shall issue forthwith.\n\n\n\nWOLLMAN, Chief Judge, with whom MORRIS SHEPPARD ARNOLD, Circuit\nJudge, joins, concurring.\n\n       I agree with the court that the district court erred in not according the parties the\nunitary status hearing that had been promised to them. Accordingly, I join in the\nholding reversing the order appealed from and remanding the case to the district court\nwithout reassignment to another district judge.\n\n       I write separately only to indicate that I do not wish my agreement with the\ndisposition of the appeal to be read as my endorsement of all that is said within the\nopinion regarding this court’s earlier opinions in this case, or of all that is said\nregarding what the School District must show to satisfy the district court that it is\nentitled to a declaration that it has achieved unitary status. For me, it is enough to say\nthat the district court should have given the parties the hearing it had promised them.\nThe court’s opinion now assures them of that hearing, which I hope will be held in the\nreasonably near future. As the court notes, class counsel suggested last August that the\nunitary status hearing be set in late summer of 2000, and the School District suggested\n\n       7\n        Judges Heaney, McMillian, John R.

By the time a unitary status hearing is\nheld, the School District will have had a number of months to take further steps\ntowards implementing the several remedial programs since the district court’s\nNovember 1999 order dismissing the case. What steps the School District has taken\nduring those intervening months may well be a measure of its commitment to its self-\nproclaimed good-faith efforts to take all practicable steps towards eliminating the\nprovable vestiges of discrimination.\n\nHEANEY, Circuit Judge, with whom McMILLIAN, Circuit Judge, joins, concurring.\n\n       I wholly concur in Judge John R. Gibson's well-reasoned opinion. Taking care\nto stay on the path established by the precedents of the United States Supreme Court\nand this court, Judge Gibson correctly holds that the students and parents of the\nKCMSD were denied due process when the district court declared the school district\nunitary without affording them notice or a hearing. I write separately to express more\nfully my reasons for agreeing with the majority opinion and to correct the revisionist\nhistory painted by Judge Beam's dissent.\n\n       The Kansas City schools remained segregated until 1986. In that year, we\napproved a plan to desegregate them after more than forty-five years of slavery--when\nthe state forbid the education of blacks, see Laws of the State of Missouri, 14th\nGeneral Assembly, 1st Session at 104 (Jefferson City 1847)--and 120 years of\nsegregation--when public schools for black students were not only separate, but inferior\nto those for white students, see Brown v.

Importantly, we also stated that a voluntary interdistrict\ntransfer program similar to that in St. Louis should be implemented in Kansas City.\n\n        As a result of the 1986 decrees, the facilities have improved, more books and\nteaching aids are available, class size has been reduced, remedial and compensatory\neducational programs have been funded and implemented, and educational\nopportunities for black and white students alike have improved. Although Kansas\nCity's public schools have improved, they would be better had the State and the\nKCMSD promptly complied with the Supreme Court's unanimous instruction in 1955\nto \"desegregate with all deliberate speed,\" id. at 301, or with the Supreme Court's\nunanimous opinion in 1968 \"that the time for mere deliberate speed has run out . . . .\nThe burden on the school board today is to come forward with a plan that promises\nrealistically to work and promises realistically to work now,\" Green v.

Over this period, none of these\nentities made any effort to implement a voluntary interdistrict transfer program, thus\npreventing complete integration of the Kansas City schools.9 Further, the State Board\n\n\n      9\n          In Jenkins I, we stated:\n\n      A voluntary interdistrict transfer program is one that has great potential\n      for improving the racial balance in the Kansas City area. The experience\n      in St. Louis with such a plan seems to have been favorable. The district\n      court is correct in its holding that such a program cannot be mandatorily\n      imposed upon the record before the court. Whether a refusal of a district\n      to participate in such a voluntary program may evidence discriminatory\n      intent and thus be an independent basis for further relief and mandatory\n      participation is an issue that we should not anticipate.\n\n807 F.2d at 683 n.30. In his concurrence, Judge Arnold stated:\n\n      I would hold that the District Court erred in concluding that the SSDs\n      cannot be required to participate in an interdistrict remedy for interdistrict\n      school segregation caused by the State's constitutional violations in the\n      area of housing. The case should be remanded to the District Court for\n      determination of the current interdistrict effects, if any, of the State's\n      housing violations. Any SSDs implicated by this analysis should be\n      obliged to participate in an appropriately tailored interdistrict remedy.\n\nId. at 687 (Arnold, J., concurring). Furthermore, Judge Ross stated:\n\n      At the time of argument it was my understanding that a voluntary\n      interdistrict program, patterned along the lines of the St. Louis program\n      was a real possibility. It would now appear that some of the districts are\n      not moving forward with this plan.\n\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fof Education took no responsibility for the KCMSD’s performance, and never once\nduring the fourteen-year period moved to implement the quality education programs\ncalled for in Judge Clark's plan. It simply complied with the district court's funding\norders. In addition, the constant bickering between the State and the KCMSD and the\nnumerous changes in leadership in the Kansas City schools obviously did not inspire\ncommunity, parental, or student confidence in the school district.\n\n       There is no doubt that the KCMSD currently is faced with more than its fair\nshare of difficulties--difficulties brought on in large measure by the State. Shortly after\nreceiving a judgment declaring that it had satisfied its obligations and being dismissed\nfrom this case, the State took two dramatic actions that will impair the KCMSD's\nability to provide a quality education for its students. First, it authorized the creation\nof charter schools in St. Louis and Kansas City, and second, it de-accredited the\nKansas City schools effective May 1, 2000 because students have done poorly on\nstudent achievement tests.\n\n       It is, of course, appropriate for the State to create charter schools, but it is\ndifficult to understand why it authorized the creation of these schools only in the state's\ntwo largest cities, both of which enroll a large majority of black students. Additionally,\nthe KCMSD is required to pay the cost of educating and transporting the students who\nattend these schools. As a result, Kansas City's public schools will have a more\n\n\n      In my opinion the failure to organize and implement this program would\n      be a very significant factor in determining discriminatory intent in the\n      future litigation which is certain to result from the further processing of\n      this case. The St. Louis program would be a useful model for the actions\n      to be taken by all the Missouri districts which are parties to this action.\n\nId. (Ross, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\fdifficult time providing the trained teachers, the educational programs, and the materials\nnecessary to ensure improved achievement of those students, overwhelmingly black,\nwho remain in the public schools.10\n\n       To make matters worse, the de-accreditation of the KCMSD allows students to\nattend schools in any other district within the state at the KCMSD’s expense. It is\nnoteworthy that the State, which has opposed interdistrict transfers over the past\nfourteen years, now suddenly approves of such transfers. The only logical explanation\nfor the State's sudden change of heart is that the cost of transfers must now be paid by\nthe KCMSD rather than the State. There is also a serious question as to whether the\nsuburban schools will accept large numbers of Kansas City's black students.\n\n     Before concluding, I must take issue with some of the comments in Judge\nBeam’s dissent. First, his assertion that “[s]tudent scores as measured by routine and\n\n\n      10\n         If the number of Kansas City public school children enrolled in the charter\nschools remains constant in FY 2001, the KCMSD will be limited to spending $8,240\nper pupil unless it is able to raise additional money through local taxation. (J.A. at\n1041.) Moreover, witnesses for the KCMSD testified that they expect 3,200 pupils to\ntransfer to other districts at a total cost to the KCMSD of $35,892,000. (J.A. at 1043.)\nIf this number of students transferred, the KCMSD will have just $7,450 per pupil\navailable to educate its remaining 28,000 students. (J.A. at 1045.)\n        Contrary to Judge Beam's assertion that Kansas City per pupil spending is well\nabove that spent by any other school district in Missouri, the fact is that in the 1998-99\nschool year, the last year for which statistics are available, several school districts in\nthe State of Missouri expended more per pupil than did the KCMSD, including\nBrentwood, $8,735; Clayton, $11,239; Ladue, $9,938; and Center, $8,583. See Office\nof Social and Economic Data Analysis, University of Missouri,\n<http://www.oseda.missouri.edu/countypage>. Since the 1994-95 school year,\nKCMSD's per pupil spending has declined by 21%, while per pupil spending in the\nabove-cited school districts increased on average 19.5%. See id.\n\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fregularly administered standardized tests have remained static or have declined\" is\nunfounded. From 1987 to 1994, KCMSD student test scores not only improved in most\ngrades, but significantly improved. In 1995, however, the test scores dropped, resulting\nin those cited by Judge Beam. The reasons for the decline are unexplained in the\nrecord and may be explored during the unitary status hearing. Below is a comparison\nof the test scores from 1988 to 1994.\n\n\n Grade       1987-88      1993-94     Change       1987-88     1993-94      Change\n             Math         Math                     Reading     Reading\n K           53.4         58.6        5.2+         63.0        65.4(‘90)    2.4+\n 1           48.9         57.4        8.5+         45.8        49.9         4.1+\n 2           50.6         55.3        4.7+         45.6        46.3         .7+\n 3           43.4         49.5        6.1+         41.3        44.2         2.9+\n 4           46.0         49.2        3.2+         42.6        43.5         .9+\n 5           43.8         50.0        6.2+         43.1        45.4         2.3+\n 6           42.2         42.4        .2+          40.6        40.6         0\n 7           40.9         40.5        .4-          42.0        42.6         .6+\n 8           40.3         41.2        .9+          41.7        42.9         1.2+\n\n             1989-90      1993-94     Change       1989-90     1993-94      Change\n             Math         Math                     Reading     Reading\n 9           37.7         34.3        3.4-         41.4        38.3         3.1-\n 10          39.7         37.8        1.9-         41.8        40.0         1.8-\n 11          41.2         41.8        .6+          41.6        41.2         .4-\n 12          42.0         43.7        1.7+         41.3        42.1         .8+\n\n\n\n\n                                            -20-\n\f        Second, Judge Beam states that KCMSD \"students remain as racially isolated\nas when the first remedial order was entered.\" He notes that in 1986 twenty-five\nschools had a 90%+ minority enrollment, and in 1999, that number had increased to\ntwenty-seven. His statements are misleading. The number of racially-isolated schools\nin the KCMSD decreased from twenty-five in 1986 to sixteen in 1996. See KCMSD\nStudent Census Count (Sept. 25, 1996; Jan. 29, 1997; Sept. 24, 1997; Jan. 28, 1998;\nSept. 30, 1998; Jan. 27, 1999). Only in the past three years has the number of racially-\nisolated schools jumped from sixteen to twenty-seven, a 69% increase. Such a\nsubstantial increase may indicate that the KCMSD is in the process of resegregating\nitself.\n\n       Third, Judge Beam asserts that $2 billion in tax dollars has been spent since 1985\nto fund the plan to desegregate the Kansas City schools. Accepting the validity of that\nstatement for the purpose of this concurring opinion, I note that over the fourteen-year\nperiod, the State and the KCMSD spent an average of $142,800,000 per year or\napproximately $3,900 per pupil. Of this sum, Kansas City contributed approximately\n$417 million or $833 per pupil per year.\n\n       This expenditure by the State and the KCMSD to desegregate Kansas City's\nschools must be viewed in context. As previously noted, black children were denied\nany education for forty-five years and were provided an inferior, segregated education\nfor 120 years. Although the precise dollar amount is not contained in the record, it is\nclear that both the State and the KCMSD saved hundreds of millions of dollars during\nthe slavery and segregation periods. The expenditures for desegregation must be\nbalanced against the savings made over 165 years.\n\n       Of all the conclusions reached by Judge Beam in his dissent, the most disturbing\nis that it is beyond the KCMSD’s power, with or without the cooperation of the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fMissouri State Board of Education, to close the achievement gap between black and\nwhite students even to the modest degree required by the district court and now\nrequired by this court. The fact of the matter is that achievement levels of Kansas\nCity's black students have improved and will continue to improve as long as the State\nand the KCMSD understand that it is their responsibility to do everything reasonably\npracticable to achieve this result.\n\n       As the Supreme Court made clear in Board of Educ. v. Dowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n247 (1991), withdrawal of federal supervision requires not only compliance with the\ncommands of the Equal Protection Clause, but also a showing “that it [is] unlikely that\nthe Board [will] return to its former ways.” Thus to achieve unitary status, the\nKCMSD must demonstrate not only that it has eliminated racial isolation to the extent\npracticable, see Missouri v. Jenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90 (1995), but also that it will\nmaintain those gains when the litigation ends. Absent a unitary status hearing, it could\nnot be determined whether the KCMSD has met these requirements.\n\n       No one knows what will occur next, but one thing is certain: Kansas City needs\ngood public schools that offer all students, black or white, rich or poor, a good\neducation. Without a good public school system, all of Kansas City will suffer–the\ncommunity, the parents, and most of all the students who deserve an education which\nwill enable them to be productive citizens. If the State of Missouri now believes that\nthe KCMSD is not capable of operating the Kansas City schools, it can and should take\nover the schools and try its hand at giving the students a quality desegregated\neducation. If the State is unwilling to do so–and to this point it has been–it should not\npenalize the students by dismantling the KCMSD. Rather the State should find a way\nto work with the KCMSD to improve education and provide the resources necessary\nto achieve that end.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fJOHN R.

In fact, Jenkins III neither \"authorizes\" nor forbids\nreliance on this type of vestige; rather, it tells us to look at the evidence in the case to\ndetermine what part of the gap (if any) was caused by the constitutional violation. See\n515 U.S. at 101. Judge Clark so found, 959 F. Supp. at 1157-65, and we held his\nfindings were not clearly erroneous. See Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 597-99. Jenkins\nXIV is thus the law of the case.\n\n       Judge Clark's order faithfully followed Jenkins III.\n\n       KCMSD does not now ask us to reconsider Jenkins XIV, nor did the present\ndistrict judge suggest that he was reconsidering it or applying any exception to the law\n\n\n\n\n                                           -23-\n\fof the case doctrine. Further, when the case was before us in 1997, KCMSD sought\nand supported the ruling that the achievement gap was a vestige of segregation. In its\nJenkins XIV brief, KCMSD stated: \"KCMSD's expert, whom the court declared\ncredible, established the causal connection between de jure segregation and current\nminority student achievement.\" Brief at 36. \"KCMSD presented substantial evidence\nthat the student achievement vestige continues, consistent with Jenkins III standards.\"\nBrief at 35. KCMSD benefitted from the Jenkins XIV ruling, which allowed it to retain\nthe $4.96 tax levy imposed to fund the remedy for the continuing constitutional\nviolation. See 959 F. Supp. at 1154-55. KCMSD, having sought that ruling and having\nenjoyed the benefits of it, does not now seek to repudiate it.\n\n        Judge Loken states that Judge Clark \"did not make the critical finding that any\nachievement gap among students within the KCMSD was also a vestige of\ndiscrimination with a causal link to the de jure violation being remedied.\" Infra at 46\n(internal quotation omitted). Judge Clark stated: \"The Court finds that Dr. Trent's test\nis reliable and accurately identifies the incremental portion [of the achievement gap]\nattributable to the prior de jure discrimination.\" 959 F. Supp. at 1164. Later, in\nsumming up his findings, Judge Clark wrote: \"The Court has found that 13% of the\ninitial gap and 13% of the increase in the gap may be traced to the prior discrimination\nwithin the KCMSD.\" Id. at 1165.\n\n       Judge Loken contends that Judge Clark should not have imposed the burden of\nproof on the constitutional violators to show that the achievement gap was not caused\nby the constitutional violations. This burden of proof question was fully considered and\ndecided in our 1997 opinion. See Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 593-95. In KCMSD's brief\nfiled with this court in 1997, it argued that \"[t]he burden of demonstrating . . . that\nunitary status exists, rests squarely with the constitutional violator.\" Brief at 29.\nAlthough this argument dealt with the State as a constitutional violator, KCMSD has\n\n\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\fadmitted that it is also a constitutional violator and that the burden of proof rests with\nit.

In short, a school district in shambles is not a constitutional violation.14\n\n      14\n        In his concurrence Judge Heaney contends that I paint a \"revisionist history\"\nof this litigation. While I sincerely wish that I could revise the history of this\ntroublesome case, I have not done so. I have, instead, accurately reflected the record\nthat was before Judge Whipple and have amply provided citations that support my\nstatements and conclusions.\n\n        Judge Heaney discusses the sordid history of slavery in America, a circumstance\nwe all regret, and discusses the unequal and unlawful dual school system that existed\nin Missouri prior to 1954. These facts, of course, are relevant, if at all, only to the\ninitial matter of unconstitutional segregation, a holding long since determined and\nratified and not now at issue in this or any recent appeal.\n\n       Judge Heaney also faults the State of Missouri for its alleged failure to embrace\nhis pedagogical and social vision of how the Kansas City school system should have\nbeen operated since 1986, a failure of acceptance shared, at least in part, by many\nschool administrators and other local public officials, parents of students of all races\nand numerous teachers and their collective bargaining representative. However, as the\nSupreme Court pointedly noted in Jenkins III, most of Judge Heaney's vision falls well\noutside of the remedial authority of the federal court in this specific litigation or any\nother similar litigation for that matter.

Further, since the\nState was dismissed from this appeal by Judge Whipple's predecessor in 1997, a\ndecision that was affirmed by this court, Judge Heaney's disapproval is directed toward\na non-party and, perhaps, this court because it rejected several of his proposals on en\nbanc review many years ago.

Finally, Judge\nHeaney expresses disapproval of the actions of the suburban Kansas City schools and\nrefers to \"voluntary\" programs undertaken in St. Louis. However, his statement\nunderscores an important point–suburban Kansas City school districts, over Judge\nHeaney's objection, were specifically found to be free of constitutional violations and\nwere duly dismissed from this litigation. See Jenkins I, 807 F.2d at 672-73. On the\n\n\n\n                                           -27-\n\fother hand, St. Louis suburban schools, under threat of a finding of constitutional\ncomplicity by the Court of the Eastern District of Missouri, entered into a settlement\nagreement, enforceable by the district court, in which a program of state-funded inter-\ndistrict transfers were stipulated to and required. See Liddell v. Missouri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433833\"><a href=\"/opinion/433833/craton-liddell-v-state-of-missouri-craton-liddell-v-city-of-st-louis/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1302-09 (8th Cir. 1984) (en banc).\n\n       Judge Heaney, in footnote 10, questions my taxing and spending figures for the\neducational operations of the KCMSD. First, he cites single-year figures for the 1998-\n1999 school year for three affluent suburbs of St. Louis and one small affluent district\nnear Kansas City, while I cite long-term average comparisons for KCMSD and the\nschool districts across Missouri. But, to consider the 1998-1999 school year with\nJudge Heaney, KCMSD spent $8,239 for school operations, excluding capital\nimprovements, while the surrounding suburban school districts spent an average of\n$5,834 per pupil. In general, no matter how you manipulate isolated figures, there is\nsimply no doubt that over the last fourteen years, KCMSD has spent substantially more\nper student per year than any other Missouri school district.\n\n      Judge Heaney also seems to misunderstand and, therefore, misapply my\ndiscussion of the two billion dollars estimate for the cost of the court's desegregation\nplan. He misses the point that the two billion dollars mentioned is for the desegregation\nplan alone and this amount is above and beyond the usual annual expenses for\neducational operations of KCMSD. Indeed, excluding capital expenditures, KCMSD\nhas had total operational expenditures of approximately one billion dollars since July\n1, 1997, alone. A very recent illustration of Judge Heaney's erroneous calculations can\nbe found in the record for operational expenditures by KCMSD from July 1, 1997,\nthrough June 30, 1999. The two years of expenditures, excluding capital\nimprovements, amounted to $679,196,524, or, $9,426 per student per year and the\nrecord establishes that per student costs for earlier years of the desegregation plan have\nalmost always equaled or exceeded these more recent figures. This is, of course, an\namount far different from Judge Heaney's fourteen-year unsupported calculation of\n$3,900 per pupil.\n\n      In a similar vein, Judge Heaney takes me to task for my accurate statement that\n\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\f       So after fifteen years, we are called upon to decide only one issue–whether the\ndistrict court was correct in dismissing this costly and seemingly endless case without\nholding an evidentiary hearing.15\n\n\n\neducational test scores have \"remained static or have declined\" during the life of the\ndesegregation plan. In rebuttal, he cites results from school year 1993-1994. What he\ndoes not note is that at the achievement gap hearing in 1997, Dr. William Trent, Judge\nClark's preferred expert, noted that some time during the 1994-1995 school year \"a new\ntest form\" with \"different scaling\" was used. See Transcript at 1289. Similar evidence\nis contained elsewhere in the record. I submit that such changes make year-to-year\ncomparisons problematic. However, without dispute, test scores experienced a steady\ndecline from the year cited by Judge Heaney until at least the end of the 1999 school\nyear. In any event, although changes occurred during this period, the beginning and\nending figures in my table are absolutely correct as is my conclusion that recurring\nITBS, TAP and MAP scores indicate that advances in educational achievement did not\noccur over time especially in the upper elementary grades and in high school.\n\n        Finally, Judge Heaney claims that my conclusions on racial isolation by school\nare misleading, and points to a short period of time when several schools dropped\nbelow a ninety percent minority level, the level above which the term \"racial isolation\"\nis definitionally applied. While he is correct for this limited period, he also admits that\ndue to changing neighborhood demographics and other unstated reasons, the number\nof racially isolated schools (i.e., ninety percent or higher minority population) has now\nreached the level I set forth in the body of my dissent. And, of course, he doesn't\nmention that, in part, this apparent resegregation is a result of a limitation on remedies\navailable to the federal court imposed by the Supreme Court in Jenkins III. Thus, my\nstatement that the Kansas City schools remain as racially segregated today as when the\nlitigation began is accurate.\n      15\n       The class contends the hearing held on January 7, 2000, was not sufficient\nbecause the KCMSD had the burden of proof on unitary status.

I write separately only to emphasize that even if such an achievement gap can\nbe correctly viewed as a vestige of prior discrimination, the district court had more\nthan sufficient evidence in the record to rule that KCMSD had shouldered its burden\nof showing that it had eliminated the gap to the extent practicable. This entitled\nKCMSD to a determination of unitary status.\n\n       Unitary status (and final relief from court control) is achieved when the vestiges\nof prior discrimination have been eliminated \"to the extent practicable.\" Missouri v.\nJenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102 (1995) (Jenkins III) (emphasis mine). The class now\nconcedes that the only remaining vestige in this case, if any, lies within a portion of a\nblack-white educational achievement gap that exists among the students of KCMSD.\n This theory was conceived by Dr. William Trent and adopted by the district court in\nJenkins VIII after a three-week-long hearing held to determine, in part, the State's\nmotion for unitary status of KCMSD. 959 F. Supp. at 1158.\n\n    As a threshold matter, I note that any evidence that such a vestige exists in\nKCMSD is dubious at best. Even a cursory examination of the bases for Dr. Trent's\n\n\n\nproof is only an issue if the evidence stands in equipoise. Additionally, a party with the\nburden of proof is, of course, allowed to rest on the record before the court in order to\nshoulder both its burden of production and persuasion. Further, it is odd that the\nbeneficiary of another party's burden, as the class is here, would have cause to\ncomplain, especially since an unfettered opportunity to rebut anything in the record\nthought persuasive to the district court was afforded the class by the court.

Similar\nevidence based upon Dr. Trent's methodology was held inadmissible under Daubert\nstandards by the Seventh Circuit. See People Who Care, 111 F.3d at 537.\nNonetheless, this court clings to the claimed existence of such a vestige of\ndiscrimination.16\n\n\n      16\n         In footnote 6 of his opinion for the court and his separate concurrence, Judge\nJohn R. Gibson faults my concern for the merits of this case. Although Judge Gibson's\nformulation of the issue on appeal is slightly different than I have stated, ante at 8, we\nboth agree that the correctness of Judge Whipple's determination of the existence of\nunitary status in KCMSD is a component of the question at hand. It is my position that\nif KCMSD has reached unitary status, Judge Whipple should be affirmed. Thus, the\nmerits of the unitary status holding must be reviewed, and the entire record, not just\nthat developed on November 1 and 2, 1999, must be considered.\n\n       In spite of his panel opinion position that he continues to restate in substantial\npart en banc, Judge Gibson now purports to hinge reversal of Judge Whipple on his\nfailure to schedule and hold a hearing on the subject of unitary status. He cites United\nStates v. Board of School Commissioners, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747640\"><a href=\"/opinion/747640/united-states-v-board-of-school-commissioners-of-the-city-of-indianapolis/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1997), an inapposite\ncase that actually cuts in the opposite direction, for the proposition that the class was\ndeprived of a \"constitutional guarantee\" of a unitary status hearing. Ante at 11. This\ndeprivation, he posits, requires a reversal and remand. Other than Board of School\nCommissioners, which unremarkably holds that you cannot impose more (rather than\nless as Judge Whipple proposes) requirements on a school district without notice and\n\n\n\n                                          -31-\n\fa hearing, Judge Gibson cites no authority for this newly minted constitutional\nguarantee. 128 F.3d at 512. I believe there is no such guarantee whether based upon\ndue process, equal protection or any other constitutional provision. Under the\nprocedures followed, the class was clearly afforded more due process than any apposite\nprecedent has ever required.\n\n      Judge Gibson also argues that the merits of Judge Clark's 1997 decision, finding\na purported vestige of prior discrimination wrapped up in an achievement gap, are\nbeyond consideration by the court en banc. This argument is apparently based upon\na \"law of the case\" theory. Again, he cites no precedent for this proposition and\nindeed, the argument turns law of the case principles upside down. This is especially\ntrue when the court en banc is considering, as here, a previously unreviewed panel\nopinion for the first time. See Irving v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759695\"><a href=\"/opinion/759695/gail-merchant-irving-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 161 (1st Cir.\n1998). And, as Judge Gibson himself stated in Liddell \"the court en banc should\nattempt to decide the case correctly rather than consistently.\" 731 F.2d at 1331.\n\n       In 1997, Judge Clark and the panel erroneously disregarded Supreme Court\ndirections concerning burdens of proof and other substantive mandates. Beyond that,\nthere was, as noted in Judge Loken's dissent, a total failure to establish a vestige of\ndiscrimination \"traceable, in a proximate way, to [a] prior [constitutional] violation.\"\nFreeman v.

There was simply nothing offered to\nJudge Clark beyond speculation and conjecture, and, as cataloged in the body of my\ndissent, every court that has been approached with this theory has rejected it out of\nhand.\n\n      Finally, Judge Gibson seems to misunderstand my concern that the panel's\naffirmance of Judge Clark's achievement gap vestige flies directly in the face of the\nSupreme Court's mandate in Jenkins III.

Many of the\nother schools with a similar or greater gap have never been found guilty of race\ndiscrimination of any sort. Id. at 502-03.

KCMSD has identified five areas that supposedly contribute to low\nachievement by its minority students. These areas are (1) expectations by teachers; (2)\nlack of a core curriculum; (3) ineffective staff development; (4) lack of a\ncomprehensive assessment system; and (5) the absence of accountability at all levels.\nKCMSD created, and had the court approve, five plans to address these factors\n(classroom practices, professional development, assessment, accountability, and\ncurriculum). Each of these plans is now purportedly at a different stage of its\nimplementation, ranging from nearly complete to barely underway.19 All parties\n\n\n      19\n         The class, the court and Judges Heaney and Gibson in their concurrences\nconcentrate solely upon the KCMSD educational programs purportedly developed and\nimplemented (or in process of implementation) since Judge Clark's and the panel's\nadoption of an achievement gap vestige in 1997. However, the record available to\nJudge Whipple shows that the 1985 KCMSD remedial plan, formulated by Judge Clark\nand approved by the panel, was designed to achieve \"results more in keeping with\nnational norms,\" with reading skills at such national norms to be achieved within four\nor five years, and was similar if not almost identical, with one exception, to the present\nset of plans touted by the class and insisted upon by the panel in its now vacated\nopinion.

The class also concedes the\nremaining obstacle to unitary status is the implementation of the plans to a\n\"satisfactory\" level, whatever that may be. However, there is a more fundamental\nproblem.\n\n      The undisputed evidence offered at the 1997 hearing shows that non-minority\nand minority students respond equally to effective teaching and innovative educational\n\n\n\n\n             school desegregation.\n\nJenkins v. Missouri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"665837\"><a href=\"/opinion/665837/kalima-jenkins-by-her-next-friend-kamau-agyei-carolyn-dawson-by-her-next/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 398 (8th Cir. 1994) (Beam, J., dissenting to denial\nof petition for rehearing) (citations omitted).\n\n       The above-mentioned staff development plan mirrors the professional\ndevelopment plan and the classroom practices plan that are presently being pursued.\nThe educational program and effective schools programs were focused on raising\nstudent test scores and making people accountable . The only current plan that does\nnot appear to have something equivalent in the 1985 order is the assessment plan. That\nplan, however, is the one that all the parties now agree is fully implemented.\n\n       Although the current plans are now advanced as new and necessary for the\neducational progress needed to close the achievement gap in KCMSD, they really are,\nas philosopher Yogi Berra might have said, \" déjà vu all over again.\" Although Jenkins\nIII now indicates that this grandiose 1985 program was well beyond the remedial\nauthority of the federal court, its establishment and vigorous implementation, at\nunparalleled cost to taxpayers, amply proves that KCMSD has now done everything\n\"practicable\" to achieve unitary status. Victory should be declared and the case should\nnow be dismissed.\n\n\n\n                                         -36-\n\ftechniques.20 Transcript at 1411-12 (Trent), Transcript at 498 (Armor) and Transcript\nat 271 (Dr. Christine Rossell). The implemented and to-be-implemented programs at\nKCMSD will, according to the testimony, raise the test scores of all KCMSD students\nwithout regard to race. This laudable and sought after educational result occurs\nbecause, as the Supreme Court noted in Jenkins III, a \"rising tide lifts all boats.\"\nJenkins III, 515 U.S. at 102. In other words, under the current plan all KCMSD\nstudents will improve at the same rate in normalized curve equivalents (NCEs). Clearly\nthen, the evidence shows that the presently approved court educational plan, by itself,\nwill not impact the achievement gap. Without influence from factors well beyond the\ncontrol of KCMSD, the approach now championed by the class and the court will only\nserve to make the goal unattainable. In short, when the gap is eliminated, if it ever is,\nit will not be because of federal court supervision of curriculum and classroom\ninstruction. It will be because of societal changes that are not achievable through use\nof the remedial power and authority of the federal courts.21\n\n       Accordingly, the proposed use of an achievement gap to measure lingering\ndiscrimination is a misconceived idea, and use of it will never allow KCMSD to reach\na \"satisfactory\" level in the eyes of the class and, perhaps, some members of this court.\nUnder this scenario, federal court supervision will continue for, perhaps, another\n\n\n\n\n      20\n        There is also evidence that higher achieving students will respond better to\nthese new techniques widening the gap even further. (Trent, Transcript at 1411-12).\n      21\n         The court's opinion refers to \"[t]he Jenkins class, representing the children of\nthe Kansas City, Missouri School District.\" Ante at 3. Under the evidence of this case,\nand the current vestige arguments being advanced by the class, it is, in my view, almost\ncertain that the class does not now represent the interests of all of the children of\nKCMSD.\n\n\n\n                                          -37-\n\ftwenty-three years. This, of course, is not a lawful application of the clear mandates\nof the Supreme Court in Jenkins III.\n\n       Even if the plans adopted by the court could conceivably close the achievement\ngap, KCMSD has fulfilled its constitutional obligations to remedy the discrimination\nto the extent practicable. Under this contingency, the issue before the court is whether\nthe plans have been implemented satisfactorily. The district court's November 1-2,\n1999, hearing and the January 7, 2000, hearing demonstrate that they have been. After\nthe November hearing, the district court found the State's accreditation process is: \"(1)\nbased on standards that are fully consistent with the Court's desegregation orders; (2)\nan attempt to infuse accountability in the KCMSD that is fully consistent with the\nCourt's desegregation orders; and (3) unlikely to engender the high degree of negative\nconsequences that could prevent compliance with the United States Constitution.\"\nJenkins X, 73 F. Supp. 2d at 1077.\n\n       These holdings have not been appealed by any of the parties. And, if they have\nbeen, they are clearly supported by the record. The court heard testimony from Dr.\nMarilou Joyner of Missouri's Department of Elementary and Secondary Education,\nwhich is responsible for evaluating the school district and making recommendations\nabout accreditation. Dr. Joyner testified that all five of the court-approved plans\nconform to state accreditation requirements. Additionally, KCMSD offered evidence\nand neither the class nor the court has disputed the showing that it was firmly\ncommitted to continue with the implementation of the plans approved by the district\ncourt as the best way to meet the state standards–a necessary step to avoid eventual\nimplementation of the de-accreditation threat.\n\n       In Freeman v. Pitts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992), the Supreme Court stated that one of\nthe factors that should inform the court's discretion in deciding unitary status was\n\n\n\n\n                                          -38-\n\f\"whether retention of judicial control is necessary or practicable to achieve compliance\nwith the decree.\" Id. at 491. Additionally, as we have said in other discrimination\ncases, when a state takes independent action that will address the court's remedial\nconcerns, the court should step aside. See Liddell v. Special Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n870-71 (8th Cir. 1998). These findings make it clear the district court's presence in the\nlitigation is no longer necessary to achieve constitutional objectives and the State has\nadequately addressed the court's remaining remedial concerns. As a result, the district\ncourt was correct in finding that unitary status had been achieved.\n\n        In an effort to dodge or obfuscate the real issues of the case, the class, as earlier\nindicated, complains that it was a violation of due process and reversible error for the\ncourt to dismiss the case without holding a previously contemplated and announced\nevidentiary hearing.22 This argument is specious and is not supported by the law of\nthis or any other circuit. At the remedy stage of a school desegregation case, the\ndistrict court proceeds under its equitable authority, controlling the outcome of the\nlitigation with a series of injunction-like orders. This court, in past opinions in this\ncase, has described the broad and continuing equitable authority of the district court as\n\"'characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a facility for\nadjusting and reconciling public and private needs.'

Such circumstances have\nobviously arisen in this case.\n\n       On October 21, 1999, well after the court's discussions of a potential January 3,\n2000, hearing, a major event changed the nature and scope of this litigation. The\nMissouri State Board of Education voted to withdraw educational accreditation of\nKCMSD as of May 1, 2000, and insert itself into the educational picture in Kansas\nCity. As a result of the State's action, the KCMSD quickly made a motion in the\ndistrict court to have this action declared void ab initio. The district court responded\nimmediately and held the evidentiary hearing of November 1 and 2, 1999.\n\n        The State's appearance through the accreditation process dramatically altered the\nlandscape of the litigation. With court-approved plans and State requirements in\naccord, one with the other, as earlier noted, every item of evidence necessary to\ndetermine unitary status was in place before the district court. Thus, the court's unitary\nstatus holding, based upon the entire record, was clearly correct. An educational gap\nthat purportedly represents a vestige of long eliminated de jure segregation has not\nbeen established and even if it has been, with currently approved educational programs,\nit will not be and, indeed, cannot be mitigated, much less eradicated. The idea that\nKCMSD has now, after twenty-three years, done everything practicable to \"remedy the\n[earlier] violation to the extent practicable,\" is not clearly erroneous–it is clearly\n\n\n\n\n                                          -40-\n\fcorrect. For the court to have held otherwise on this record would have been an abuse\nof discretion.\n\n       All current requirements being imposed by this litigation extend well beyond any\nlawful remedies for violations of distant acts of de jure segregation. And, this case is\nnot about a federal district judge who made a procedural mistake by not holding yet\nanother evidentiary hearing entailing countless thousands of additional taxpayer dollars\nfor court time, staff time, attorney fees and expert witnesses. It is about matters that\na federal court no longer has a legitimate right to involve itself in.\n\n       It is long past the time to follow the admonition of the Supreme Court in Jenkins\nIII and '\"restore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that is\n[now] operating in compliance with the Constitution.\"' 515 U.S. at 101 (quoting\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 489). \"Returning schools to the control of local authorities at the\nearliest practicable date is essential to restore their true accountability in our\ngovernmental system.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490.\n\n      The KCMSD is unitary. I would affirm the district court.23\n\n\n      23\n         Since the court seems bent upon an alternate course, it is proper to make one\nadditional observation. The court in its footnote 6 states that it finds it unnecessary to\ndiscuss the merits of Judge Whipple's order concerning unitary status. Although not\nexplicitly stated, this is presumably because the only issue reached by a majority of the\ncourt en banc is whether an evidentiary hearing should have been conducted by Judge\nWhipple prior to his decision, So, in my view, footnote 6, Chief Judge Wollman's\nconcurrence joined by Judge Morris Sheppard Arnold and this dissent should be a clear\nsignal to Judge Whipple that he is now free to set a hearing date that accommodates a\nreasonable preparation period for the parties and to then hear and decide the unitary\nstatus of KCMSD free and clear of any verbiage contained in the panel opinion which\nwas vacated by the grant of en banc consideration in this case.\n\n\n\n                                          -41-\n\f                               ADDENDUM\n\n          IOWA

The Court defined the scope of an appropriate remedy:\n\n      the proper response by the District Court should have been to eliminate\n      to the extent practicable the vestiges of prior de jure segregation within\n      the KCMSD: a systemwide reduction in student achievement and the\n      existence of 25 racially identifiable schools with a population of over 90%\n      black students.\n\n515 U.S. at 90. Among the remedial measures the Court reversed was a mandate to\nfund “quality education programs.” In rejecting this court’s attempt to fill in the gaps\nin the district court’s analysis of that issue, the Supreme Court cautioned:\n\n      Although the District Court has determined that “[s]egregation has caused\n      a system wide reduction in achievements in the schools of the KCMSD,”\n      639 F. Supp., at 24, it never has identified the incremental effect that\n      segregation has had on minority student achievement or the specific goals\n      of the quality education programs.\n\n515 U.S. at 101 (emphasis in original). The Court remanded, instructing the district\ncourt “that its end purpose is not only ‘to remedy the violation’ to the extent\npracticable, but also ‘to restore state and local authorities to the control of a school\n\n\n\n\n                                         -45-\n\fsystem that is operating in compliance with the Constitution.’” Id. at 102, quoting\nFreeman v.

Its prior findings as to vestiges --\nas determined by the Supreme Court -- were limited to finding a systemwide reduction\nin student achievement. Yet the district court on remand did not make the critical\nfinding that any achievement gap among students within the KCMSD was also a\nvestige of discrimination with “a causal link to the de jure violation being remedied.”\nJenkins III, 515 U.S. at 96. Instead, the district court held that “the plaintiffs are\nentitled to the presumption that current disparities are causally related to prior\nsegregation, and the burden of proving otherwise rests on the defendants.” Jenkins v.\nMissouri, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1157 (W.D. Mo. 1997). Having ducked the critical\ncausation question, the district court proceeded to quantify a present “race effect” of\n2.6 normalized curve equivalents (NCEs) and order that it be remedied. A panel of this\ncourt again affirmed. Jenkins v.

The result of shifting the burden of proof was to place on KCMSD the\nimpossible burden of proving that no part of the present-day gap -- which ironically is\nsignificantly less in Kansas City than the national norm, see 959 F. Supp. at 1158 --\n\n\n      24\n         The order to close the achievement gap by 2.6 NCEs effectively ignored the\ndistaste expressed by all nine Justices for decrees that require a certain level of\nstatistical performance on standardized tests before unitary status can be found.
