Clifford Turner, and Sigmund Blumenfeld, as trustees of the segregated trust of the First National Bank Trust Company of Baraboo, Wisconsin, plaintiffs, against Arthur Judevine and Seba Judevine, his wife, and Ethel Judevine, a daughter, defendants, to set aside transfers of two parcels of real estate, one in Sauk county and one in Forest county, and the assignment of a leasehold interest in certain other property situate in Sauk county, on the ground that the conveyance was made with intent to hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of Arthur and Seba Judevine.</p>\n<p>From the judgment entered on January 17, 1939, setting aside the conveyances, the defendants appeal.  The facts will be stated in the opinion.\nThis action involves principally questions of fact.

It was the contention of the defendants that by the making of this agreement she became emancipated and was entitled to compensation for the services rendered to the parents in the home.

It was not intimated in that case that the provisions of ch. 102, Stats., operated generally to enable minors to enter into enforceable contracts.
