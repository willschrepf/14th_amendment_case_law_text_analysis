The record before the court consists of stipulated exhibits and facts as set forth in the Stipulations of Undisputed Facts (Joint Stipulations) filed by the parties on July 2, 2010, ninety-seven exhibits admitted into evidence, including the deposition testimony of two unavailable witnesses, Reem Boualem and Sandra Lamb, and the testimony at trial of four witnesses, all of whom are employed by Clark &amp; Washington, P.C.: Zachary Burroughs, managing attorney for the Knoxville office, Emory Clark, founding and managing partner, Richard Thomson, supervising partner, and Amanda Stofan, managing attorney for the Chattanooga office.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>This is a core proceeding. 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(A), (O) (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Clark &amp; Washington, P.C. (Clark &amp; Washington) is a law firm based out of Atlanta, Georgia.<sup>[2]</sup> It was founded in 1983 by Emory Clark, who serves as managing partner, focusing primarily upon the administration and financial aspects of the firm. It employs approximately fifty-four attorneys and operates offices in six cities: Atlanta, Georgia, Tampa and Orlando, Florida, and Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, Tennessee. The Knoxville office, which was opened in 2006, consists of four separate branches, with the primary location at 5401 Kingston Pike.<sup>[3]</sup> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*614</span> Knoxville office employs six attorneys and thirteen staff members, and its sole practice area is consumer bankruptcy. Zachary S. Burroughs is the managing attorney. He graduated from law school in 2004, has been a practicing attorney for approximately five years, and was made managing attorney for Clark &amp; Washington's Knoxville office following the departure of its former managing attorney, Steven F. Crawford, in late November 2009.</p>\n<p>In order to properly analyze the issues raised in these contested matters, it is necessary to revisit, briefly, the facts and issues addressed by the court in <i>In re Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. 854 (Bankr.E.D.Tenn. 2009) which, as in these cases, centered around Clark &amp; Washington's fee arrangements with debtors in seven Chapter 7 cases. Specifically, the primary issues confronting the court in <i>Waldo</i> were whether Clark &amp; Washington was collecting discharged fees from its clients and the firm's failure to disclose the true nature of its fee arrangements in the Disclosure of Compensation of Attorney for Debtor(s) Statements (Compensation Disclosure Statements) being filed with the court. The <i>Waldo</i> cases came before the court through various motions filed by the United States Trustee (U.S. Trustee) asking the court to enter an order requiring Clark &amp; Washington and its attorneys to amend the Compensation Disclosure Statements filed in each case to accurately reflect the fee arrangement with those debtors; to amend the Schedule F filed in each case to list Clark &amp; Washington as a creditor for unpaid pre-petition legal fees; and seeking sanctions against Clark &amp; Washington and Steven Crawford, its managing attorney at that time, in the form of disgorgement of all fees collected through the post-petition and post-discharge cashing of post-dated checks received from the debtors in each case as well as all attorneys' fees paid pre-petition. Following preliminary hearings and the agreement to consolidate the cases for adjudication, the issues in <i>Waldo</i> were defined as follows: (1) what was the nature of Clark &amp; Washington's engagement contract with each of its clients as to whether its fees were a flat fee or bifurcated fee and if that agreement complied with the Bankruptcy Code; (2) whether the original Compensation Disclosure Statements accurately reflected the contract between Clark &amp; Washington and the respective debtors; (3) whether depositing a post-dated check or corresponding with debtor clients post-petition, including phone calls and letters concerning attorneys' fees not paid due to insufficient funds, violated the automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(6) and/or 11 U.S.C. § 524's permanent injunction; (4) whether Clark &amp; Washington advised debtor clients that pre-petition attorneys' fees are among the kind that are discharged in bankruptcy; and (5) because Clark &amp; Washington failed to advise debtor clients that their pre-petition attorneys' fees would be discharged in their bankruptcy cases, whether it should be ordered to disgorge their fees pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 329(b).</p>\n<p>The <i>Waldo</i> Memorandum and Order were filed on October 27, 2009. In its thorough memorandum opinion, this court resolved several issues, including issues that have been raised in these fifteen contested matters relating to the acceptance of post-dated checks as payment for attorneys' fees, the necessity of a full and accurate disclosure of compensation, and the dischargeability of attorneys' fees incurred pre-petition. One such issue resolved by <i>Waldo</i> was whether Clark &amp; Washington's engagement contract provided for payment of a flat fee or a fee bifurcated into pre- and post-petition services. The court concluded that notwithstanding the statements at the end of each contract executed by the respective debtors that they \"acknowledge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*615</span> and agree that this retainer contract contemplates payment for services rendered pre-Petition as well as services to be rendered post-Petition[,]\" the attorneys' fees were not bifurcated. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 883. Based on the opening paragraph of the contracts, providing that \"It is hereby agreed by the undersigned `Attorney' and `Client' that Attorney shall represent Client in a case under Title 11 USC Chapter 7. Client agrees to an attorney fee of _____[,]\" and the rule of law in Tennessee that contracts are construed as of the date upon which they are made, this court held that, irrespective of when services were to be rendered, the engagement contracts between Clark &amp; Washington and the respective <i>Waldo</i> debtors clearly provided for payment of a non-refundable flat fee prior to the filing of the petitions and the obligation of each debtor to pay the fees arose at the time the contract was executed. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 878, 883. Accordingly, having found that Clark &amp; Washington's fees were pre-petition flat fees, this court joined the majority of other courts and also held that any unpaid attorneys' fees under the flat fee arrangement between Clark &amp; Washington and the <i>Waldo</i> debtors were dischargeable, a fact of which Clark &amp; Washington was required to advise its clients but had neglected to do so. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 885.</p>\n<p>With respect to the issue of accepting post-dated checks from debtor clients, <i>Waldo</i> unambiguously holds that \"because `flat fee' or `no-look' attorneys' fees contracted for pre-petition are dischargeable, it is unacceptable for attorneys to ask for and receive post-dated checks from debtors to be cashed post-petition as payment of those fees.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 886 (citing cases). The decision also delved into the potential ethical implications of accepting post-dated checks, analyzing the practice in the context of Rule 1.8(a) of the Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct which prohibits attorneys from acquiring an ownership, possessory, security, or other pecuniary interest adverse to their clients' interests. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 886 (quoting TENN. SUP. CT. R. 8, Rule 1.8(a)). Although this court declined to find that acceptance of post-dated checks from debtors created \"a per se conflict of interest between attorneys and debtors due to the `credit transactions' between them, the practice at least raises the question and the appearance of such a conflict since the information concerning potential dischargeability of the fees was not disclosed to the Debtors whereby they could seek additional legal advice, and they did not consent, in writing, to acceptance of this potential conflict.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 887.</p>\n<p><i>Waldo</i> also addressed the automatic stay and discharge injunction aspects associated with accepting payment of attorneys' fees through post-dated debtor checks. Following discussion of recent Sixth Circuit precedent concerning presentment of checks and the automatic stay's exception for the presentment of negotiable instruments at 11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(11) (2006), this court found that although presentment of the debtors' post-dated checks for payment during the pendency of the bankruptcy case did not violate the automatic stay, attempts to collect payment on checks that had been returned unpaid due to insufficient funds did violate the stay. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 889-90. Additionally, with respect to the discharge injunction imposed by 11 U.S.C. § 524(a) (2006), the decision points out that § 524(a) contains no such exception, thus all of Clark &amp; Washington's post-discharge attempts to collect payment from debtors for NSF checks violated the discharge injunction, as did the post-discharge presentment of post-dated debtor checks for payment. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 891.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*616</span> Finally, <i>Waldo</i> addresses the compensation disclosure requirements of 11 U.S.C. § 329(a) (2006) and Rule 2016(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, reinforcing the importance and necessity for accurate disclosure of compensation received by attorneys from debtors in order to \"enable[] courts to carefully scrutinize compensation paid to debtors' attorneys, providing protection to debtors and creditors and preventing overreaching by attorneys.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 892-93 (citing <i>Jensen v. United States Trustee (In re Smitty's Truck Stop, Inc.),</i> 210 B.R. 844, 848 (10th Cir. BAP 1997)). This court also held that \"[t]he failure to comply with the disclosure rules is a sanctionable violation, even if proper disclosure would have shown that the attorney had not actually violated any Bankruptcy Code provision or any Bankruptcy Rules[.]\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 893 (quoting <i>In re Campbell,</i> 259 B.R. 615, 627 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2001)) (quoting <i>Neben &amp; Starrett, Inc. v. Chartwell Fin. Corp. (In re Park-Helena Corp.),</i> 63 F.3d 877, 880 (9th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p>As a result of its actions giving rise to the seven <i>Waldo</i> cases, Clark &amp; Washington was required to disgorge all attorneys' fees received from the debtors in those cases and was required to refund service charges collected for debtor checks that were returned for insufficient funds. Clark &amp; Washington disgorged all fees as required under <i>Waldo</i> and additionally voluntarily refunded $123,742.00 in actual or potential fees attributable to other similarly situated cases, by returning outstanding post-dated checks in its possession. COLL. TRIAL EX. 147 ¶ 8. Additionally, Clark &amp; Washington revised its Chapter 7 Attorney-Client Agreement (Engagement Contract)<sup>[4]</sup> with respect to its attorneys' fees to be paid for services rendered in association with its representation of debtors in Chapter 7 cases. <i>See</i> TRIAL EX. 100.</p>\n<p>As it relates to the issues raised in these fifteen contested matters, the initial Clark &amp; Washington post-<i>Waldo</i> six page, single-spaced engagement contract, which outlines the debtors' duties as well as those of Clark &amp; Washington, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> the following:</p>\n<blockquote>I. Pre-Petition Fees and Services:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>a. Attorney offers and advertises a free consultation to prospective bankruptcy clients. Much of that initial consultation involves information gathering and interviews with clients regarding their debts, assets, financial circumstances, and transactions. Consequently, a large portion of Client's case intake was performed during the initial consultation. There is no charge for this service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b. The balance of the pre-Petition fee covers the remaining services required to assist Client in obtaining their required credit counseling certificate, gathering necessary information and documents, advising Client regarding the legal issues involved in Client's case, advising Client of the upcoming process, advising Client of their responsibilities as a debtor, and preparing and filing Client's bankruptcy pleadings. The fee for these services is a flat fee of $____.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>ANY FEE RELATING TO PRE-PETITION SERVICES WHICH IS NOT PAID PRIOR TO THE FILING OF CLIENT'S CASE IS SUBJECT TO BEING DISCHARGED IN CLIENT'S CASE. ACCORDINGLY, ATTORNEY WILL WAIVE ANY ATTORNEY FEE FOR PRE-PETITION SERVICES WHICH HAS NOT BEEN PAID PRIOR <span class=\"star-pagination\">*617</span> TO THE FILING OF CLIENT'S PETITION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>II. Post-Petition Fees and Services:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>a. <i>Retainer.</i> As a condition of representation in this case, Client agrees to pay Attorney a retainer for services to be rendered post-Petition in Client's case. The retainer shall consist of post-dated checks in the total amount of $_____.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This retainer shall be applied to the post-Petition services to be rendered by Attorney in Client's case. These services include, but are not limited to, those services listed in paragraph b. below. The retainer is based upon a blended hourly rate of $165. The amount of the post-Petition fees shall be capped at the amount of the retainer listed above, regardless of the amount of services expended in excess thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The parties contemplate that the value of the post-Petition services rendered by Attorney in this case shall meet or exceed the total amount of the quoted retainer. Nonetheless, Client is entitled to request a final accounting of the fees charged by Attorney in this case and thereafter receive a refund of any amount of the retainer paid in excess of the value of the post-Petition services rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>CLIENT IS ADVISED THAT THE USE OF POST-DATED CHECKS FOR POST-PETITION PAYMENT OF A <i>PRE-PETITION</i> CHAPTER 7 ATTORNEY FEE IS NOT ALLOWED IN THE MAJORITY OF JURISDICTIONS. TO ATTORNEY'S KNOWLEDGE, THE ACCEPTANCE OF POST-DATED CHECKS AS A RETAINER AGAINST SPECIFICALLY-SEGREGATED, <i>POST-PETITION</i> SERVICES HAS NOT BEEN DISALLOWED. NONETHELESS, CLIENT MIGHT WISH TO CONSULT INDEPENDENT COUNSEL IN THIS REGARD.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b. <i>Post-Petition Services:</i> The post-Petition services to be rendered by Attorney in Client's case include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>i. Notifying specific creditors of Client's case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>ii. Filing Notices of Stay in any other court or tribunal where an action is pending against Client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>iii. Mailing Client a copy of all petitions, notices and pleadings filed on Client's behalf;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>iv. Notifying Client of all court hearings, meetings, or other proceedings scheduled in Client's case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>v. Consulting with Client about any questions or problems that might arise relating to Client's case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>vi. Preparing for, attending, and representing Client in all required court hearings or other proceedings in Client's case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>vii. Preparing and filing any and all pleadings and other documents which are necessary or appropriate in the prosecution of Client's case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>viii. Advising Client of their responsibilities as a debtor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>ix. Assisting/advising Client in carrying-out their statement of intentions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>x. Assisting Client in obtaining and filing the required pre-discharge financial management certificate; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>xi. Assisting Client in cooperating with requests by the panel trustee, UST, or the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>c. <i>\"CarveOuts\"</i>:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>i. These fees do not include court filing costs. Client shall be responsible for all court and credit counseling costs associated with this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*618</span> ii. Client agrees to pay an additional fee of $100.00 plus applicable court costs for each amendment filed, post-petition, to include, list, or disclose any information which Client failed to provide to Attorney prior to the filing of Client's case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>iii. Adversary Proceedings: the parties specifically agree that the services contemplated in this contract of employment DO NOT include representing Client, either as a Plaintiff or Defendant, in any adversary proceeding filed in or in connection with this case. Should Attorney agree to represent Client in an adversary proceeding, a different contract of employment shall be executed between the parties under such terms and conditions as the parties deem mutually acceptable. If Client is served with an adversary proceeding complaint, Attorney shall take appropriate steps to protect Client's best interests until such time as either Client informs Attorney that Client does not wish to litigate the matter, Client declines to retain Attorney, Client obtains other counsel, or Attorney is allowed to withdraw by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p>TRIAL EX. 100. At trial, Mr. Thomas testified that he personally drafted the \"straddle\" contract at the end of October 2009, in an attempt to comply with the court's directives in <i>Waldo</i> by removing the non-refundable nature of the fees, adding the language advising that pre-petition attorneys' fees were potentially subject to discharge, adding the language concerning the potential conflict with taking post-dated checks in some jurisdictions, and removing all carve-outs other than adversary proceedings and post-petition amendments. Believing that the \"straddle\" contract was in compliance with <i>Waldo</i> and after instituting the new engagement arrangements, Clark &amp; Washington's Knoxville office once again began accepting, as one of its methods for payment of attorneys' fees, post-dated checks from debtors in addition to payments from third parties, payment in full prior to filing, or providing services pro bono. JT. STIPS. ¶ 2.</p>\n<p>Approximately three weeks later, Mr. Thomas once again revised Clark &amp; Washington's engagement contract, removing subsection ii. accessing the additional fee for filing amendments contained in the \"CarveOuts\" section, stating it did not fit in with the spirit of a \"straddle\" contract and that it caused problems with their clients. <i>See</i> TRIAL EX. 101. No other changes were made to the second post-<i>Waldo</i> form Chapter 7 Attorney Client Agreement, and the firm continued taking post-dated checks from debtors as payment for Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>After noting that Clark &amp; Washington was continuing to take post-dated checks from debtors, drawn on their bank accounts, the court entered an Order in <i>Hart</i> on December 8, 2009, directing Mr. Burroughs and Clark &amp; Washington to appear and show cause why their compensation should not be limited to the $201.00 received from the Debtors pre-petition, why they should not be required to return all post-dated checks to the Debtors, and why the court should not summarily disallow all compensation purportedly paid by post-dated checks and direct the return thereof to the respective debtors in all Chapter 7 cases filed after entry of the <i>Waldo</i> decision on October 27, 2009. As required by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*619</span> the court in its show cause order, Mr. Burroughs and Clark &amp; Washington filed a brief on January 7, 2010, arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that they had attempted to comply with the court's directives in <i>Waldo</i> and that the post-dated checks received from the Debtors were a retainer against post-petition services.</p>\n<p>On March 19, 2010, the U.S. Trustee filed the Motion for Sanctions and Other Relief Against the Law Firm of Clark &amp; Washington and Attorney Zachary Burroughs and Notice of Hearing (First Motion for Sanctions) in <i>Lawson, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe, Womble, Aaron,</i> and <i>Knight,</i> asking the court to enter an order finding Mr. Burroughs and Clark &amp; Washington in contempt and ordering them to disgorge any prepaid or post-paid fees collected for filing inaccurate compensation disclosure statements, for failing to adequately disclose that unpaid attorneys' fees were potentially dischargeable, and for violating the court's decision in <i>Waldo.</i><sup>[6]</sup> Additionally, the U.S. Trustee requested sanctions such as requiring all compensation disclosure statements filed by Clark &amp; Washington to contain an original signature of a partner, shareholder, or principal, requiring the firm to filing an accounting of all billable time for non-flat fee cases, requiring fifteen additional CLE hours for each attorney in the firm's Knoxville office, assignment of a court-approved co-counsel to review all filings by Clark &amp; Washington, and suspension from practicing before the court for a time to be determined.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, on April 1, 2010, the U.S. Trustee filed the Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 105(a) Against Clark &amp; Washington, P.C., and Zachary Burroughs for Violations of Local Rule 2090-2 and General Order 2008-005 (Second Motion for Sanctions) in <i>Lawson, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe,</i> and <i>Womble,</i> asking the court to find Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs in violation of the Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct for failing to obtain an original signature from the Debtors prior to filing the amended Statement of Financial Affairs on March 4, 2010. The U.S. Trustee requested imposition of sanctions, including suspension of the firm's electronic signature filing privileges, requiring the firm's attorneys to complete additional CLE courses, and suspension of Clark &amp; Washington's attorneys from practice before the court for a time period to be determined.</p>\n<p>Following the filing of the Second Motion for Sanctions, the court entered an Order directing Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs to file a response by April 15, 2010. The Response of Clark and Washington, P.C. and Zachary Burroughs to U.S. Trustee's Motions for Sanctions (Response) was filed on April 12, 2010. In the Response, Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs acknowledged that they filed inaccurate initial Compensation Disclosure Statements in <i>Lawson, Hart, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe, McGee,</i> and <i>Womble,</i> but contended the errors were inadvertent and corrected when they filed amended Compensation Disclosure Statements. Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs also acknowledged that in <i>Lawson, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe,</i> and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*620</span> <i>Womble,</i> they filed amended Statements of Financial Affairs without first obtaining handwritten signatures from the Debtors and that doing so was wrong but denied that they intended to mislead the court. With respect to the sanctions sought by the U.S. Trustee, Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs averred that they had taken steps to ensure that neither error occurred in the future, including changes to their procedure for filing compensation disclosure statements subject to review by a partner. Additionally, they agreed that disgorgement was an appropriate supplemental sanction to their self-imposed sanction whereby they previously disgorged $123,742.00 in fees in an attempt to comply with the <i>Waldo</i> opinion but argued that any additional sanctions sought by the U.S. Trustee are not necessary or appropriate.</p>\n<p>All matters raised in the U.S. Trustee's Motions for Sanctions, the <i>McGee</i> Motion, and the court's show cause order in <i>Hart</i> were consolidated for trial at the preliminary hearing and continued hearings held on April 22 and May 13, 2010, respectively.

In response to questions concerning their attorney fee arrangements with Clark &amp; Washington, and specifically regarding the payment of those fees through third-party post-dated checks, Ms. Lawson testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. So the first time you met with them [Clark &amp; Washington], about the second <span class=\"star-pagination\">*624</span> or third week of October, that you just discussed the fee arrangement, and what did they tell you that arrangement would be, besides the amount?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. That at that point, you all hadn't decided on the law. He said that it was just they could do five posted checks at $160 a month from us. And then when we came back the second time, which technically would be the first time for filing the petition, that's when they told us about the law, and that it had to be a third party. So then we came back a third time with our third party checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now let's talk about those third-party checks. Who was the third party that wrote the checks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. A friend of ours. Jordan Perlioni.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. And did he offer to pay for your bankruptcy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No, ma'am. We have to pay him back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now how do you pay him back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. We pay him back with cash. We just take it out of our budget for the whole month and give it to him, and then he puts hisputs that cash into the account where the checks are coming out of, and it gets paid that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. So he didn't really offer to make the payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. So why do you suppose you had to do this with a third-party check? I mean having it from a friend, when you're actually making the payment yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, from what they toldwhat Mitch [Chessman] told us was that our debt, our attorney's fees, would be canceled out in the bankruptcy. And then at that point, I'm assuming that people weren't paying their attorney's fees like they had originally agreed to. So the third party which we had gone to and said, \"hey can you help us with this,\" and we made the agreement with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. So in fact he's not really paying your bankruptcy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No. He's justhis name is on the check.</blockquote>\n<p>COLL. TRIAL EX. 11 [K. Lawson] pg. 8, ln. 10-pg. 10, ln. 9. Ms. Lawson's testimony was echoed by Mr. Lawson, who testified that Mr. Perleoni, a long-time friend, provided them with the post-dated checks at their request after they were advised by Clark &amp; Washington that the options for payment of the attorney fees were either in full up front or through a third party:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. And did you ask him if he could fund you the money to pay up front for your bankruptcy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. The way I'd explained it to him is that we needed the third-party checks and that I would give him the money before the check cleared to make sure it was in his account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Who made that suggestion that you do it that way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I'm not sure I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Well, did someone suggest to you that you could get a third-partyyou could just agree to make payments to them and let them provide the checks, or did you come up with that idea all by yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. We were told that the attorney's office would need third-party checks toeither up front or a third party. We were explained that it couldn't be our post-dated checks. I called Jordan on the phone and told him what the deal was and told him, just to let you know, I'm going [to] make sure the moneyor I'm going to give you the money before the checks clear. That way he doesn't <span class=\"star-pagination\">*625</span> have to worry about making sure his money is there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Did you call him from the attorney's office or from your home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I believe I called him from the attorney's office, right after we spoke to them and they told me that they would need third-party checks.</blockquote>\n<p>COLL. TRIAL EX. 11 [J. Lawson] pg. 4, ln. 17-pg. 6, ln. 2.</p>\n<p>During the Rule 2004 examination, the Lawsons identified and/or reviewed their contract with Clark &amp; Washington and, with respect to what they understood the contract to provide as to the attorney fees they were paying, Ms. Lawson testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. When you met with your attorneys, did they tell you how much they were going to charge you for doing the pre-petition workthat means the work up until they filed your caseand how much they were going to charge you for the post-petition work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. They just said everything would be in that $800. Everything would be included in that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. So they told you that was a flat fee for filing the bankruptcy basically?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. For the initial filing. If we had to do an amendment or anything like that, there were additional fees, which I believe I've got a copy of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And do you recall that the terms were in this document that you would pay $800a pre-petition fee of $800 that covers the remaining services? Is that correct?....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. And as for post-petition fees and services, the amount was zero, wasn't it? There's nothing there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. There'sthey said the $800 would cover all of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. They didn't specify exactly how much went to which.</blockquote>\n<p>COLL.

TRIAL EX. 17 pg. 187, ln. 17-pg. 188, ln. 10. When asked by the U.S. Trustee about the dual nature of pre-petition and post-petition fees and services, the Dickersons testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now what do you think that means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, it sounds like, if I gave them any money in  before the filing, that I could have put them in the filing and wiped that out. That's what it sounds like. I don't know if that's true or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now I want you to look down at the next paragraph, paragraph 2. It talks about post-petition fees and services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And it talks about a retainer, and it shows that  it says that the retainer shall consist of post-dated checks in the total amount of $1,100, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q.  because it does have the numbers in there. And it says here that the retainer </blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I do recall that, yes. I do recall that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now, let's look at this next paragraph. I want you to read it out loud for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*639</span> A. This retainer shall be applied to the post-petition services to be rendered by attorney in client's name. These services include, but are not limited to those services listed in paragraph 8 below. The retainer is based upon a blended hourly rate of $165. The amount of post-petition fees should be capped at the time of the retainer listed above regardless of the amount of services expended in the excess thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now, what do you think that means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, it sounds to me like we agree on that amount to get the job done no matter what it takes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. But that's the amount. Do you understand what it means to have an hourly rate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now, tell me what  how do you think that </blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, that's like $175 per  $165 per hour, however many hours it takes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now I want you to read this next paragraph to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Okay. The parties contemplate that the value of the post-petition services rendered by attorney in this case shall meet or exceed the total amount of the quoted retainer. Nonetheless, client is entitled to request a final accounting of the fees charged by attorney in this case and thereafter receive a refund of any amount of the retainer paid in excess of the value of the post-petition services rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Have you  do you understand the implication of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. That says that if it was a real quick and simple process and didn't take a lot of their time, unless there were charges that they can show me they had to pay, I might get some of that $1,100 back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Right. Did you understand that before you just read that now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No, I can't tell you that I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. How about you, sir, did you read that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Dickerson] We read it together off the same page. ... We skimmed through it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Did you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I understand it now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. But you didn't understand it then. Did they explain  sit down and explain that that $1,100 was subject to an hourly rate and only  they would only bill according to how much time they spent on your case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Dickerson] We were told that it was going to cost this amount, and that's why we did the post-dated checks. And we were supposed to read that. I probably skimmed through it and didn't fully understand it.</blockquote>\n<p>TRIAL EX. 17 pg. 191, ln. 10-pg. 194, ln. 23.

Specifically, whether the post-<i>Waldo</i> engagement contracts and fee arrangements employed by Clark &amp; Washington and implemented by Mr. Burroughs as managing attorney for its Knoxville office constitute true \"straddle\" arrangements for the division of pre- and post-petition fees and services in compliance with the directives of <i>Waldo.</i><sup>[57]</sup></p>\n<p>One of the primary issues in <i>Waldo</i> was whether or not the engagement contract and fee arrangement between Clark &amp; Washington and the respective debtors under the terms of which the firm collected, pre-petition, post-dated checks drawn on debtor accounts for deposit post-petition constituted pre-petition debts, subject to discharge. After analyzing case law from this jurisdiction, as well as others, this court concluded that \"the attorneys' fees in each case [were] flat fees which arose pre-petition, irrespective of when services were to be rendered.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 883; <i>see also </i><i>In re Griffin,</i> 313 B.R. 757, 762-63 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.2004) (\"Under the Bankruptcy Code, a contract-based claim is a pre-petition claim if prior to filing[,] the relationship between the debtors and the creditor contained all the necessary elements to create a right to payment under the relevant contract.\"). This court went on to then state the following:</p>\n<blockquote>[A]cceptance of post-dated checks for payment of \"flat-fee\" or \"no-look\" attorney's fees is not an acceptable practice and runs afoul of the Bankruptcy Code <span class=\"star-pagination\">*664</span> and Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, [and finds] the division of a flat fee arrangement into pre-petition and post-petition parts to be conceptually inconsistent and therefore untenable. The Court therefore joins those other courts which hold that when a flat or fixed fee pre-petition agreement is at issue, the fee must be paid in full prior to the commencement of the debtor's case or the fee is discharged under § 727(b).</blockquote>\n<p><i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 882, 885 (quoting <i>In re Mansfield,</i> 394 B.R. 783, 791 (Bankr.

In summary, this court held that \"because `flat fee' or `no-look' attorney's fees contracted for pre-petition are dischargeable, it is unacceptable for attorneys to ask for and receive post-dated checks from Debtors to be cashed post-petition as payment of those fees.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 886.</p>\n<p>Recognizing, however, that attorneys should be compensated for the services they provide, this court, at the conclusion of the <i>Waldo</i> opinion, gave the following three examples of potentially allowable methods for payment of attorneys' fees in Chapter 7 cases: \"(1) requiring Chapter 7 debtors to pay `flat' or `no-look' attorney's fees in full prior to filing; (2) revising retainer agreements and expressly designating pre-petition services, which are paid pre-petition, and post-petition services, which shall be paid post-petition; or (3) accepting payments by third parties.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 895.</p>\n<p>Immediately following entry of the <i>Waldo</i> decision, Mr. Thomson drafted the initial post-<i>Waldo</i> contract, and Mr. Crawford, the managing attorney of the Knoxville office at that time, instructed the Knoxville office to stop taking post-dated debtor checks. That practice was resumed, however, after Mr. Crawford left the firm in November 2009, and Mr. Burroughs was instructed by the Atlanta office to begin taking post-dated debtor checks once again under the post-<i>Waldo</i> \"straddle\" contract, continuing until January 2010, when Mr. Clark instructed the Knoxville office to only take post-dated third party checks.<sup>[58]</sup> Additionally, Mr. Burroughs testified that although the Knoxville office ceased collecting post-dated checks written on debtor accounts, it continued depositing post-dated checks received prior to entry of the <i>Waldo</i> decision and it has continued depositing post-dated checks written on debtor accounts in its possession.</p>\n<p>In support of Clark &amp; Washington's post-<i>Waldo</i> \"straddle\" contract, Mr. Thomson testified that in the immediate aftermath of the <i>Waldo</i> opinion, he instructed all of the Knoxville offices not to take post-dated debtor checks for a few days and began drafting a revised engagement contract that provided for receipt of post-dated checks pre-petition in contemplation of post-petition services while correcting the major three problems pointed out by the court. To that end, the initial and second post-<i>Waldo</i> engagement contracts both remove a statement that attorneys' fees are nonrefundable, remove all carveouts other than for adversary proceedings and amendments, segregate pre-petition and post-petition services, add language advising that pre-petition debts are subject to discharge, and add language that debtors may consult other counsel concerning the acceptability of post-dated checks. <i>See</i> TRIAL EX. 100; TRIAL EX. 101. These contracts also provided for debtors to pay a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*665</span> minimal flat fee, usually $150.00, when the contract was signed, with that amount designated for pre-petition services, and to pay the remaining balance of the fees due via post-dated checks, with that amount designated for post-petition services. <i>See</i> TRIAL EX. 100; TRIAL EX. 101. These are the engagement contracts executed by all of the Debtors in these contested matters with the exception of the Soleses, who executed the pre-<i>Waldo</i> contract.</p>\n<p>In spite of the assertions by Mr. Thomson, Mr. Clark, Mr. Burroughs, and Ms. Stofan to the contrary, neither of the post-<i>Waldo</i> engagement contracts is a true \"straddle\" agreement and neither complies with <i>Waldo.</i> Regardless of Clark &amp; Washington's purported attempt to bifurcate the attorneys' fees into pre- and post-petition services, the fact remains that each of the Engagement Contracts in these fifteen cases was entered into pre-petition, as was the obligation for payment. Each Engagement Contract is prefaced with the phrase, \"Client agrees to pay the following fees\" and then fixes the liability of the respective Debtors at the full amount of the pre- and post-petition figures inserted into the respective Engagement Contracts. As stated in <i>Waldo,</i> \"[i]f these arrangements were true `saddle obligations' as argued by Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Crawford, they would not collect post-dated checks pre-petition in anticipation of post-petition services but would, instead, seek payment for post-petition services as rendered post-petition.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 883-84. The engagement contracts themselves, as well as the testimony at trial can lead to no other conclusionthese are \"flat fee\" contracts.</p>\n<p>The post-<i>Waldo</i> engagement contracts attempt to bifurcate fees, advising clients that they have paid their \"minimal flat fee\" for pre-petition fees<sup>[59]</sup> and that they, \"[a]s a condition of representation,\" have agreed to pay \"a retainer for services to be rendered post-petition\" to consist of post-dated checks totaling the remaining amount. <i>See</i> COLL.

The engagement contracts then go on to provide that the retainer will be applied to post-petition services and \"is based upon a blended hourly rate of $165\" with the fees \"capped at the amount of the retainer listed above, regardless of the amount of services expended in excess thereof\" and that \"[t]he parties contemplate that the value of the post-petition services rendered ... shall meet or exceed the total amount of the quoted retainer.\" <i>See</i> COLL.

JT. STIPS. ¶ 5. Additionally, Clark &amp; Washington does not routinely provide itemized statements or accountings of post-petition services to debtors. In fact, Mr. Burroughs testified that only one debtor has asked for an accounting and only after an inquiry by the U.S. Trustee's office. Ms. Stofan testified that none of the firm's Chattanooga clients has requested an accounting, nor has that office ever provided a client with an itemized statement of services rendered. JT. STIPS. ¶ 9.</p>\n<p>As for what each of the Debtors understood, their testimony clearly evidences that each of them thought that they were paying a flat fee for their bankruptcy case. When asked how much Clark &amp; Washington was going to charge for doing the pre-petition work and how much would be charged for the post-petition work, Ms. Lawson testified that it wasn't specified that a certain amount would be designated for either, but that \"[t]hey just said everything would be in that $800.00. Everything would be included in that.\" COLL. TRIAL EX. 11 [K. Lawson] at pg. 15, ln. 11-22; pg. 18, ln. 15-pg. 19, ln. 6. Similarly, Ms. Newman testified that she did not realize she would be charged different amounts for the work performed by Clark &amp; Washington pre-petition and post-petition, that she understood the entire fee to cover everything. TRIAL EX. 30 pg. 213, ln. 4-11. Ms. Dickerson testified that she understood that the attorney fee would cover their whole bankruptcy. TRIAL EX. 17 pg. 187, ln. 17-pg. 188, ln. 10. Ms. Zick testified that she simply thought the cost of her bankruptcy was a thousand or so dollars. TRIAL EX. 25 pg. 13, ln. 1-8. Ms. Woods' mother testified that she and her daughter understood the fee to be $1,250.00 for the entire bankruptcy case. TRIAL EX. 47 pg. 160, ln. 22-pg. 161, ln. 5. Ms. Sanchez testified that she and Mr. Sanchez were actually quoted $1,250.00 as the entire fee for filing their case by the person they met with at Clark &amp; Washington, as did Mr. Cox, Mr. Hoffman, Ms. Vittetoe, the McGees, and Ms. Womble, TRIAL EX. 37 pg. 11, ln. 6-19; TRIAL EX. 69 pg. 220, ln. 5-20; COLL.

Additionally, Mr. Aaron testified at his meeting of creditors that all he remembered was that he had to pay $350.00 in advance plus provide post-dated checks totaling $1,250.00. TRIAL EX. 79 pg. 163, ln. 14-pg. 164, ln. 14.</p>\n<p>When questioned about the retainer at trial, Mr. Burroughs testified that, pursuant to the terms of the engagement contracts, any unused portions should be refunded. He then stated, however, that Clark &amp; Washington attorneys and paralegals do not keep track of their time and do not bill at an hourly rate and that the firm has not returned any unused retainers to debtors. Additionally, Mr. Burroughs testified that the Debtors were aware, on the dates they signed their contracts, the total amount of attorneys' fee to be charged, inclusive of both the $150.00 pre-petition fee and the agreed upon post-petition \"retainer\" in the form of post-dated checks, and that receipt of payment in full of that retainer, through post-dated debtor or third-party checks, was a condition of and prerequisite to Clark &amp; Washington filing any debtor's case. Similarly, Mr. Thomson <span class=\"star-pagination\">*667</span> testified that each Debtors' obligation to pay the entire amount of fees arose at the time the contract was executed and if not paid, the non-paying debtors would have been in breach of contract.</p>\n<p>With respect to his Affidavit introduced into evidence as Trial Exhibit 97, Mr. Burroughs testified that he did not personally compile the time records attached thereto, but that paralegals in his firm estimated the time amounts based upon notes contained in a database kept by Clark &amp; Washington, after which Mr. Burroughs reviewed the records and made revisions. No time records were kept within the database, and all time entries were based on estimates assigned by the paralegals who prepared the attachments. His testimony was corroborated by Ms. Stofan, who testified that although the \"straddle\" contract provides for a blended hourly rate of $165.00 for attorneys and paralegals, she has never established an hourly rate and does not keep time records. Significantly, the time estimates were prepared pursuant to the court's directives set forth in the Pretrial Order entered on May 14, 2010, and not periodically as each case progressed. The $165.00 \"blended hourly rate\" allegedly charged by Clark &amp; Washington for post-petition services appears to be nothing more than a convenient figure to be utilized in estimating the post-petition fees in the unlikely event a debtor should request an accounting. However, as evidenced by the court's calculations set forth earlier in each Debtors' factual section, the $165.00 \"blended hourly rate\" is merely a fiction. Clearly, Clark &amp; Washington never intended to account to these Debtors for the unused portion of any attorneys' fee.</p>\n<p>Mr. Thomson's and Mr. Burroughs's testimony that the \"straddle\" contract provides a true breakdown between pre- and post-petition fees is also contradicted by the receipts issued to the respective debtors in each case which contains a blocked-off section providing the following information:</p>\n<blockquote>PERSONAL CHECK POLICY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1. Checks are verified prior to filing your case</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. Your case will not be filed until the full amount due is paid in advance</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. No personal checks if you have NSF Debts</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. There will be a $25.00 charge for each returned check</blockquote>\n<blockquote>5.

TRIAL EX. 83.<sup>[60]</sup> The receipts, with the exception of the Harts' and McGees', contradicts Mr. Burroughs's testimony that Clark &amp; Washington's Knoxville office does not pursue its clients for payment on post-dated checks returned for insufficient funds. Also, with the exception of the <i>Hart</i> and <i>McGee</i> cases, item 6 contravenes the provision in each Engagement Contract that \"Client is entitled to ... receive a refund of any amount of the retainer paid in excess of the value of the post-Petition services rendered.\" <i>See</i> TRIAL EX. 9; TRIAL EX. 15; TRIAL EX. 22; COLL.

Under no type of contract will the court condone acceptance of post-dated checks from debtors written on their accounts, to be cashed post-petition, as payment of attorneys' fees. As discussed in detail, \"there are serious ethical implications in such a practice,\" raising \"the question and the appearance\" of a conflict of interest between Clark &amp; Washington and the affected debtors. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 886-87.<sup>[61]</sup> Clark &amp; Washington's attempts to camouflage its flat fee by bifurcating it into a minimal pre-petition amount and a much larger post-petition amount is disingenuous at best, especially in light of the evidence that in none of the cases presently before the court did the assigned time for services rendered come anywhere close to equaling the \"retainer\" amount multiplied by the $165.00 \"blended hourly rate.\"</p>\n<p>The court also finds the practice of accepting post-dated checks from third parties to be suspect and borderline violative of the Bankruptcy Code's prohibition on advising debtors to incur debt in anticipation of filing for bankruptcy. Section 526(a) states that debt relief agencies including attorneysshall not do any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) fail to perform any service that such agency informed an assisted person or prospective assisted person it would provide in connection with a case or proceeding under this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) make any statement, or counsel or advise any assisted person or prospective assisted person to make a statement in a document filed in a case or proceeding under this title, that is untrue and misleading, or that upon the exercise of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*669</span> reasonable care, should have been known by such agency to be untrue or misleading;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) misrepresent to any assisted person or prospective assisted person, directly or indirectly, affirmatively or by material omission, with respect to</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(A) the services that such agency will provide to such person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) the benefits and risks that may result if such person becomes a debtor in a case under this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(4) advise an assisted person or prospective assisted person to incur more debt in contemplation of such person filing a case under this title or to pay an attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fee or charge for services performed as part of preparing for or representing a debtor in a case under this title.</blockquote>\n<p>11 U.S.C. § 526(a); <i>see</i> 11. U.S.C. § 101(12A) (2006) (defining \"debt relief agency\" in material part as \"any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration[.]\"); <i>Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P.A. v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1324, 1332, 176 L.Ed.2d 79 (2010). In <i>Milavetz,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"§ 526(a)(4)[, which is best understood to provide an additional safeguard against the practice of loading up on debt prior to filing,] prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising a debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for bankruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose.\" <i>Milavetz,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1336.</p>\n<p>Without finding conclusively that Clark &amp; Washington has violated § 526(a)(4), the court is nevertheless troubled by the acceptance of third-party post-dated checks. With respect to the firm's procedure concerning third party checks, Mr. Burroughs testified that debtors are advised that they can ask a family member or neighbor to \"gift\" them the attorneys' fee, with the understanding that there is no requirement for the debtors to repay them, but that he never advised clients to take out a pre-petition loan from any source to fund the attorneys' fees. He also testified that there is no pre-petition, dischargeable debt owed to the third parties because the fee is earned and paid post-petition. Likewise, Mr. Thomson argued that acceptance of third-party post-dated checks, as well as any attempts to collect upon them, does not violate <i>Waldo</i> because §§ 362(a) and 524(a) do not apply to such payments made by third parties.</p>\n<p>Messrs. Burroughs and Thomson's testimony, however, contradicts testimony offered by the various Debtors with respect to what was intended when they were advised by Clark &amp; Washington to tender third-party post-dated checks. For example, Ms. Lawson testified that she and her husband are reimbursing Mr. Perlioni, the family friend who wrote the post-dated checks for their bankruptcy case, with cash and that he never intended to `gift' them the money or to pay for their attorneys' fees. COLL. TRIAL EX. 11 [K. Lawson] pg. 8, ln. 10-pg. 10, ln. 9. Similarly, Mr. Cox testified that his girlfriend provided the post-dated checks but it was never intended that she would pay for his bankruptcy case. TRIAL EX. 69 pg. 223, ln. 13-22; pg. 230, ln. 18-pg. 231, ln. 9. Likewise, Ms. Vittetoe testified that her mother-in-law had provided the post-dated checks, but she and Mr. Vittetoe were repaying her the $223.80 prior to each check clearing the bank, TRIAL EX. 75 pg. 108, ln. 22-pg. 109, ln. 5; pg. 110, ln. 7-pg. 111, ln. 6, and Ms. Womble testified that she had agreed to repay her mother, from whom she had received the post-dated checks, when each one cleared the bank. Trial Ex. 57, pg. 33, ln. 14-21.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*670</span> Even more telling as to the true nature of these third-party payments, the Luttrells testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. So your attorneys told you you couldn't write your own post-dated checks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Ms. Luttrell] At first, when we met with them in December, they said that we could do our own post-dated checks, but when we met with them again in January they said that that was not going to work anymore, that we could either, I guess, I don't know if they said we could pay it all up front</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Luttrell] Yeah, we could pay it up front</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Ms. Luttrell]or we could do third-party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Luttrell]or we could do third-party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Ms. Luttrell] And that's what we chose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Luttrell] And they would hold the checks and we could bring the money in and they would, you know, get the checkwe could get the checks back or whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Ms. Luttrell] Or they would shred them through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Luttrell] So we just let them run them through and we pay her sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And have you paid her sister any payments yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Luttrell] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Ms. Luttrell] Yes. One check's went through and we paid for it.</blockquote>\n<p>TRIAL EX. 63, pg. 49, ln. 10-pg. 50, ln. 9. Similarly, Mr. Aaron testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. And so when you met with them did they talk to you about how you could pay your fees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. And what werewhat did they tell you about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. They told me I could pay it third-party by having, you know, one of my relatives give them five checks, they can put it through the bank or I could come up there and pay them off asas they come due, three days before they come due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. They told youdid youdid youdid the thirdwas the third party named James Carey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And did Mr. Carey give you the money or did he loan you the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. He loaned me the checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. He loaned you the checks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Didwhat was your intent about the checks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I'd pay them off beforeyou know, go ahead and pay them off as Iyou know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Did Clark &amp; Washington tell you that you could arrange it that way, where you'd come up and pick up the checks before they were cashed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. They told you. Were they aware that you were just borrowing these checks</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q.from Mr. Carey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p>TRIAL EX. 79 pg. 164, ln. 4-pg. 165, ln. 9. In fact, as can be gleaned from the Debtors' testimony, it appears that not only did Clark &amp; Washington know that manyif not a majorityof debtors using third-party checks were, in fact, repaying those third parties, but Clark &amp; Washington, through its attorneys and staff, were instructing debtors to bring in post-dated checks from third-parties while advising <span class=\"star-pagination\">*671</span> them that, if they so desired, the debtors themselves could come in and replace the postdated checks with cash prior to the dates upon which the checks were to be deposited.</p>\n<p>To state it plainly, the court finds that a pre-petition contract which fixes or predetermines the total amount of the fee a debtor is required to pay for both pre-and post-petition services establishes a \"flat fee\" under the authority of Waldo, and the collecting of post-dated checks is prohibited, irrespective of the source. As discussed, a true \"saddle\" contract contemplates a billing relationship, wherein services are rendered post-petition and the client is billed an hourly rate post-petition based upon the time spent, after the services have actually been performed. None of the Engagement Contracts in these contested matters complies with this basic concept and none complies with the court's decision in <i>Waldo.</i><sup>[62]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>With respect to the second category, the inaccurate Compensation Disclosure Statements and unsigned Amended Statements of Financial Affairs filed by Clark &amp; Washington, the court finds that although Clark &amp; Washington has acknowledged its mistakes, the fact remains that it did not take the care and attention necessary to ensure that the documents it filed with the court were accurate and properly filed. The statutory authority and procedural rules relating to the disclosure of compensation were fully addressed in <i>Waldo.</i> The court examined the combined role played by § 329(a) and Rule 2016(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure in providing a system for monitoring of attorneys' fees, allowing courts to \"carefully scrutinize\" compensation paid by debtors and stressed that full and accurate disclosure was \"mandatory\" and \"`[a]nything less than the full measure of disclosure' is unacceptable.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 893 (citations omitted). As such, it is not necessary for the court to revisit these issues again in great detail other than to reiterate that \"[t]he failure to comply with the disclosure rules is a sanctionable violation, even if proper disclosure would have shown that the attorney had not actually violated any Bankruptcy Rules, and sanctions may also be imposed for negligent or inadvertent failures to disclose.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 893 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs do not deny that they filed inaccurate Rule 2016(b) compensation disclosure statements in the <i>Lawson, Hart, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe, McGee,</i> and <i>Womble</i> cases. Mr. Burroughs testified that following entry of the <i>Hart</i> show cause order, he discovered errors on several of the Rule 2016(b) Compensation Disclosure Statements, and he filed amended disclosures for all Chapter 7 cases filed by Clark &amp; Washington post-<i>Waldo</i> to remove the straddle contract language, which had been inserted on the firm-wide template by its main office in Atlanta. The court's review of the Compensation Disclosure Statements in these contested matters not only confirms that the original disclosures made by Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs in each case were incomplete, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*672</span> but also that, notwithstanding Mr. Burroughs's attempts to correct them, the Amended Compensation Disclosure Statements he filed still do not reflect the true nature of the respective Debtors' Engagement Contracts. In fact, as of the date of this Memorandum, Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs still have not provided full and accurate disclosure of the firm's fee arrangements with some of these Debtors.</p>\n<p>Mr. Burroughs also testified that he had a conversation with the attorney for the U.S. Trustee, who brought it to his attention that the original Statements of Financial Affairs in many of the cases were inaccurate with respect to question 9, and that following that conversation, he prepared and filed Amended Statements of Financial Affairs on behalf of the Lawsons, the Harts, Ms. Newman, the Soleses, the Sanchezes, the Dickersons, Ms. Zick, the Luttrells, Ms. Vittetoe, and Ms. Womble in an attempt to more accurately reflect the payment arrangements, but in his haste to revise and file the Amended Statements of Financial Affairs, he did not send them to the respective Debtors for execution. Accordingly, he and Clark &amp; Washington do not deny that they filed the Amended Statement of Financial Affairs on behalf of the Debtors in the <i>Lawson, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe,</i> and <i>Womble</i> cases without first obtaining the Debtors' permission and handwritten signatures as required by section III.A.3 of the Administrative Procedures for Electronic Case Filing, effective May 17, 2005, as amended, which states in material part:</p>\n<blockquote>III. Electronic Filing</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Signatures</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>3. Signature of Debtor on Petition, Lists, Schedules, Statements, and Other Documents</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Notwithstanding paragraph 2<sup>[63]</sup> immediately above, any petition, list, schedule, statement, and amendment thereto that requires the debtor's signature may be filed electronically by a Registered User with the debtor's signature indicated as \"/s/\" followed by the typed name of the debtor, provided the debtor has actually signed a copy of the document and the filing attorney retains the signed document as required by paragraph 5<sup>[64]</sup> below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>4. Attorney Representation</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Electronic filing of a verified document by an attorney is a representation for the purposes of Fed. R.

Tenn. Admin. Procs. at ¶ III.A. <i>See</i> JT. STIPS. ¶ 4. In explanation, Mr. Burroughs testified that he was merely wanting to fix the errors in Clark &amp; Washington's earlier filings and that it was never his intention to misled the court or the U.S. Trustee by filing the Amended Statements of Financial Affairs without first obtaining the Debtors' handwritten signatures.</p>\n<p>Because there is no dispute that Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs filed inaccurate Rule 2016 Compensation Disclosure Statements and improperly and in violation of the Administrative Procedures for Electronic Case Filing, incorporating Rule 9011, the question becomes whether disgorgement is the appropriate sanction or if, as the U.S. Trustee asserts, something harsher is required to deter future noncompliance by Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs with respect to all of their filings.<sup>[66]</sup></p>\n<p>Section 105 outlines certain powers of the court and imposes upon the court a duty to uphold the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code in subsection (a) by authorizing the court to \"issue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.\" 11 U.S.C. § 105(a) (2005). The court may use its § 105(a) equitable powers \"in furtherance of the goals of the [Bankruptcy] Code,\" <i>Childress v. Middleton Arms, L.P.

As a result of their inaccurate disclosures in <i>Waldo,</i> Clark &amp; Washington was required to disgorge all fees received from the Debtors in those seven cases, making the decision to voluntarily return $123,742.00 in numerous other cases. And yet, within days after the <i>Waldo</i> opinion was entered, Clark &amp; Washington once again began filing inaccurate Rule 2016 Compensation Disclosure Statements which were followed by inaccurate Amended Compensation Disclosure Statements and subsequently by unverified and unauthorized Amended Statements of Financial Affairs.<sup>[67]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Although the majority of these issues were addressed and, in the court's mind, decided in <i>Waldo,</i> in order to avoid any further litigation as to what is and what is not allowed concerning fee arrangements in Chapter 7 cases and the disclosure of compensation requirements in all cases filed in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Northern Division, the court will summarize, reiterating much of what it has held previously.</p>\n<p>First, the Engagement Contracts entered into between Clark &amp; Washington and each of the fifteen Debtors creates a pre-petition obligation for payment of a lump sum or flat fee, and any portion of that lump sum or flat fee not paid to the firm pre-petition has been discharged in fourteen of these cases. The purported bifurcation of fees for pre- and post-petition services is a fiction, as is the concept that the Debtors paid a retainer to be applied against services rendered based upon the $165.00 \"blended hourly rate.\" It has been established that Clark &amp; Washington does not maintain time records for its clients and that it only created the estimated time records attached to Mr. Burroughs's Affidavit entered into evidence as Collective Trial Exhibit 97 after being directed to do so by the court. Additionally, it has been established that the amount of fees charged greatly exceeds the $165.00 \"blended hourly rate.\" Furthermore, as was evident from the testimony of the respective Debtors, none of them understood that they were to be paying under a bifurcated contract, but instead, each of them understood that the attorneys' fee charged by Clark &amp; Washington was a lump sum they were required to pay for the entire bankruptcy, to be tendered prior to filing.</p>\n<p>Second, in order to be a true \"straddle\" fee arrangement bifurcating pre- and post-petition services, the contract must clearly identify the services to be included within the pre-petition fee and the services to be included within the post-petition fee. It must also unambiguously disclose, at a minimum, that all pre-petition fees must be paid prior to filing and any unpaid pre-petition fee will be discharged and that all post-petition fees, which are not subject to the discharge, will be billed only when services are rendered and only for the specific amount of time for each activity at an agreed upon hourly rate for attorneys and a considerably lesser agreed upon hourly rate for paraprofessionals.<sup>[68]</sup> Attorneys may accept a pre-petition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*675</span> retainer to be billed against as long as the retainer is held in trust and drawn against as services are rendered, subject to time records being kept and debtors being periodically sent an itemized statement of the work performed and the retainer applied, without having to request the statement. Additionally, debtors must be made aware that they will receive any unused portion of the retainer once their case is concluded, again, without having to request it themselves.</p>\n<p>Third, it is unacceptable for attorneys to ask for and receive post-dated checks from debtors, irrespective of whether the checks are to be drawn on the debtors' personal accounts or a third party's account, and the payment of attorneys' fees through post-dated checks creates a conflict of interest under Rule 1.8(a) of the Tennessee Rules of Professional Responsibility. Additionally, the post-discharge deposit of any payments received from debtors or on their behalf for pre-petition fees may be, to the extent it could be considered an action to collect on a discharged debt, violative of the discharge injunction of 11 U.S.C. § 524(a).</p>\n<p>Fourth, Clark &amp; Washington and its Knoxville attorneys must file Compensation Disclosure Statements that accurately and fully reflect the fee arrangements with their clients. In the event the fee contract includes post-petition services, the nature of the anticipated services, hourly billing rate, and billing period should be disclosed. Additionally, each time an attorney receives post-petition compensation of any kind from or on behalf of a debtor, a supplemental Rule 2016(b) Compensation Disclosure Statement must be filed.</p>\n<p>Fifth, before filing any documents signed electronically by debtors, attorneys must have, in their possession, the original document containing the debtors' handwritten signature.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The court finds that Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs have either chosen to ignore the <i>Waldo</i> decision or to utilize less than creative methods to circumvent the court's ruling in <i>Waldo,</i> not only in these fifteen cases but in other Chapter 7 cases filed in behalf of their debtor-clients since October 27, 2009. Because the sanction of disgorgement has proved an insufficient deterrent, the court will enhance the sanctions as follows:</p>\n<p>1. Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs will, with the exception of the <i>McGee</i> case, No. 09-30353, be required to disgorge to the respective Debtors all attorney fees received pre- and post-petition and to return to the Debtors all post-dated checks, whether the Debtor or a third-party was the maker.</p>\n<p>2. Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs will be required to disgorge $300.00 to Joseph and April McGee in Case No. 10-30353 for their failure to file an accurate Compensation Disclosure Statement.</p>\n<p>3. Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs will be sanctioned the sum of $750.00 in all of these cases, with the exception of <i>McGee,</i> which sum is to be paid to the Clerk of the court for deposit to the United States Treasury.<sup>[69]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*676</span> 4. Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs shall be required to certify their compliance with paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 herein within 30 days.</p>\n<p>5. Clark &amp; Washington and its attorneys representing debtors in Chapter 7 cases hereafter filed in the court's Northern Division, shall, commencing 10 days after the entry of the Orders accompanying this Memorandum, be required to append the following declaration under penalty of perjury as an attachment to the Compensation Disclosure Statement:</p>\n<blockquote>I certify under penalty of perjury that prior to the signing of the employment contract by myself and the debtor[s] I was personally present while the debtor[s] read the contract; that I explained the agreed upon fee arrangement to the debtor[s]; that I inquired of the debtor[s] whether there were questions regarding the contract and fee arrangement, and answered those questions to the satisfaction of the debtor[s]; and that the compensation disclosure statement filed in this case correctly and accurately sets forth the fee agreement contained in the employment contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I also certify that the debtor[s], as required by Section III.A.3. of the Administrative Procedures for Electronic Case Filing, effective May 17, 2005, have actually signed a copy of all documents filed in this case containing an electronic signature.</blockquote>\n<p>The Compensation Disclosure Statement and Declaration shall both be dated and shall contain the signing attorney's handwritten signature.</p>\n<p>6. Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs shall, pursuant to Rules 9014(c) and 7054(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, be directed to pay all costs associated with the prosecution of these contested matters with the exception of <i>Hart.</i></p>\n<p>7. The obligations imposed on Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs in paragraph 5 above will remain in place for six (6) months unless, on motion of the United States Trustee filed prior to the expiration of the six (6) months, the court, for cause, extends this expiration date.</p>\n<p>Orders consistent with this memorandum will be entered in each case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Included among the stipulated exhibits are transcripts of examinations of various of the Debtors taken pursuant to Rule 2004 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and transcripts of testimony given by various of the Debtors at their creditors' meetings.

The court addressed these so-called \"carve-outs\" listed on Exhibit \"B\" in <i>Waldo</i> and found them \"particularly troublesome when Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Crawford have charged the Debtors fees ranging from $800.00 to $1,250.00, but now seek to exclude a majority of the services routinely performed post-petition from that flat fee.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 885.</p>\n<p>[20]  <i>See supra</i> n. 8.

COLL. TRIAL EX. 4; COLL. TRIAL EX. 83.</p>\n<p>[61]  Specifically, <i>Waldo</i> states the following:\n</p>\n<p>As raised by many of the courts examining the issue of post-dated checks, there are serious ethical implications in such a practice, and the same is true herethat by accepting post-dated checks for dischargeable debts and not advising their clients that the debts were at least potentially dischargeable, Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Crawford created a conflict of interest with the Debtors under Tennessee's disciplinary rules. Rule 1.8(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct states, in material part, as follows:</p>\n<p>Rule 1.8 Conflict of Interest: Prohibited Transactions.</p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not ... knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the client; and</p>\n<p>(2) The client is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel in the transaction; and</p>\n<p>(3) The client consents thereto in a writing signed by the client.</p>\n<p>TENN. SUP.CT. R. 8, Rule 1.8(a). As stated in the official comments to Rule 1.8, \"[a]s a general principle, all transactions between client and lawyer should be fair and reasonable to the client. In such transactions, a review by independent counsel on behalf of the client is advisable. Furthermore, a lawyer may not exploit information relating to the representation to the client's disadvantage.\" OFF. CMTS., TENN. SUP.CT. R. 8, Rule 1.8(a). Accordingly, \"[t]he existence of a conflict of interest does not require bad motive or intent.

Should the U.S. Trustee file disgorgement motions in other Chapter 7 cases filed by Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs pending in the court's Northern Division to the date of this memorandum, the court would not, in the absence of egregious facts differing from those presently at issue, anticipate enhancing the sanctions beyond disgorgement.</p>\n\n</div>",

The record before the court consists of stipulated exhibits and facts as set forth in the Stipulations of Undisputed Facts (Joint Stipulations) filed by the parties on July 2, 2010, ninety-seven exhibits admitted into evidence, including the deposition testimony of two unavailable witnesses, Reem Boualem and Sandra Lamb, and the testimony at trial of four witnesses, all of whom are employed by Clark &amp; Washington, P.C.: Zachary Burroughs, managing attorney for the Knoxville office, Emory Clark, founding and managing partner, Richard Thomson, supervising partner, and Amanda Stofan, managing attorney for the Chattanooga office.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>This is a core proceeding. 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(A), (O) (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Clark &amp; Washington, P.C. (Clark &amp; Washington) is a law firm based out of Atlanta, Georgia.<sup>[2]</sup> It was founded in 1983 by Emory Clark, who serves as managing partner, focusing primarily upon the administration and financial aspects of the firm. It employs approximately fifty-four attorneys and operates offices in six cities: Atlanta, Georgia, Tampa and Orlando, Florida, and Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, Tennessee. The Knoxville office, which was opened in 2006, consists of four separate branches, with the primary location at 5401 Kingston Pike.<sup>[3]</sup> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*614</span> Knoxville office employs six attorneys and thirteen staff members, and its sole practice area is consumer bankruptcy. Zachary S. Burroughs is the managing attorney. He graduated from law school in 2004, has been a practicing attorney for approximately five years, and was made managing attorney for Clark &amp; Washington's Knoxville office following the departure of its former managing attorney, Steven F. Crawford, in late November 2009.</p>\n<p>In order to properly analyze the issues raised in these contested matters, it is necessary to revisit, briefly, the facts and issues addressed by the court in <i>In re Waldo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1856884\"><a href=\"/opinion/1856884/in-re-waldo/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span> (Bankr.E.D.Tenn. 2009) which, as in these cases, centered around Clark &amp; Washington's fee arrangements with debtors in seven Chapter 7 cases. Specifically, the primary issues confronting the court in <i>Waldo</i> were whether Clark &amp; Washington was collecting discharged fees from its clients and the firm's failure to disclose the true nature of its fee arrangements in the Disclosure of Compensation of Attorney for Debtor(s) Statements (Compensation Disclosure Statements) being filed with the court. The <i>Waldo</i> cases came before the court through various motions filed by the United States Trustee (U.S. Trustee) asking the court to enter an order requiring Clark &amp; Washington and its attorneys to amend the Compensation Disclosure Statements filed in each case to accurately reflect the fee arrangement with those debtors; to amend the Schedule F filed in each case to list Clark &amp; Washington as a creditor for unpaid pre-petition legal fees; and seeking sanctions against Clark &amp; Washington and Steven Crawford, its managing attorney at that time, in the form of disgorgement of all fees collected through the post-petition and post-discharge cashing of post-dated checks received from the debtors in each case as well as all attorneys' fees paid pre-petition. Following preliminary hearings and the agreement to consolidate the cases for adjudication, the issues in <i>Waldo</i> were defined as follows: (1) what was the nature of Clark &amp; Washington's engagement contract with each of its clients as to whether its fees were a flat fee or bifurcated fee and if that agreement complied with the Bankruptcy Code; (2) whether the original Compensation Disclosure Statements accurately reflected the contract between Clark &amp; Washington and the respective debtors; (3) whether depositing a post-dated check or corresponding with debtor clients post-petition, including phone calls and letters concerning attorneys' fees not paid due to insufficient funds, violated the automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(6) and/or 11 U.S.C. § 524's permanent injunction; (4) whether Clark &amp; Washington advised debtor clients that pre-petition attorneys' fees are among the kind that are discharged in bankruptcy; and (5) because Clark &amp; Washington failed to advise debtor clients that their pre-petition attorneys' fees would be discharged in their bankruptcy cases, whether it should be ordered to disgorge their fees pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 329(b).</p>\n<p>The <i>Waldo</i> Memorandum and Order were filed on October 27, 2009. In its thorough memorandum opinion, this court resolved several issues, including issues that have been raised in these fifteen contested matters relating to the acceptance of post-dated checks as payment for attorneys' fees, the necessity of a full and accurate disclosure of compensation, and the dischargeability of attorneys' fees incurred pre-petition. One such issue resolved by <i>Waldo</i> was whether Clark &amp; Washington's engagement contract provided for payment of a flat fee or a fee bifurcated into pre- and post-petition services. The court concluded that notwithstanding the statements at the end of each contract executed by the respective debtors that they \"acknowledge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*615</span> and agree that this retainer contract contemplates payment for services rendered pre-Petition as well as services to be rendered post-Petition[,]\" the attorneys' fees were not bifurcated. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 883. Based on the opening paragraph of the contracts, providing that \"It is hereby agreed by the undersigned `Attorney' and `Client' that Attorney shall represent Client in a case under Title 11 USC Chapter 7. Client agrees to an attorney fee of _____[,]\" and the rule of law in Tennessee that contracts are construed as of the date upon which they are made, this court held that, irrespective of when services were to be rendered, the engagement contracts between Clark &amp; Washington and the respective <i>Waldo</i> debtors clearly provided for payment of a non-refundable flat fee prior to the filing of the petitions and the obligation of each debtor to pay the fees arose at the time the contract was executed. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 878, 883. Accordingly, having found that Clark &amp; Washington's fees were pre-petition flat fees, this court joined the majority of other courts and also held that any unpaid attorneys' fees under the flat fee arrangement between Clark &amp; Washington and the <i>Waldo</i> debtors were dischargeable, a fact of which Clark &amp; Washington was required to advise its clients but had neglected to do so. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 885.</p>\n<p>With respect to the issue of accepting post-dated checks from debtor clients, <i>Waldo</i> unambiguously holds that \"because `flat fee' or `no-look' attorneys' fees contracted for pre-petition are dischargeable, it is unacceptable for attorneys to ask for and receive post-dated checks from debtors to be cashed post-petition as payment of those fees.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 886 (citing cases). The decision also delved into the potential ethical implications of accepting post-dated checks, analyzing the practice in the context of Rule 1.8(a) of the Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct which prohibits attorneys from acquiring an ownership, possessory, security, or other pecuniary interest adverse to their clients' interests. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 886 (quoting TENN. SUP. CT. R. 8, Rule 1.8(a)). Although this court declined to find that acceptance of post-dated checks from debtors created \"a per se conflict of interest between attorneys and debtors due to the `credit transactions' between them, the practice at least raises the question and the appearance of such a conflict since the information concerning potential dischargeability of the fees was not disclosed to the Debtors whereby they could seek additional legal advice, and they did not consent, in writing, to acceptance of this potential conflict.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 887.</p>\n<p><i>Waldo</i> also addressed the automatic stay and discharge injunction aspects associated with accepting payment of attorneys' fees through post-dated debtor checks. Following discussion of recent Sixth Circuit precedent concerning presentment of checks and the automatic stay's exception for the presentment of negotiable instruments at 11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(11) (2006), this court found that although presentment of the debtors' post-dated checks for payment during the pendency of the bankruptcy case did not violate the automatic stay, attempts to collect payment on checks that had been returned unpaid due to insufficient funds did violate the stay. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 889-90. Additionally, with respect to the discharge injunction imposed by 11 U.S.C. § 524(a) (2006), the decision points out that § 524(a) contains no such exception, thus all of Clark &amp; Washington's post-discharge attempts to collect payment from debtors for NSF checks violated the discharge injunction, as did the post-discharge presentment of post-dated debtor checks for payment. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 891.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*616</span> Finally, <i>Waldo</i> addresses the compensation disclosure requirements of 11 U.S.C. § 329(a) (2006) and Rule 2016(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, reinforcing the importance and necessity for accurate disclosure of compensation received by attorneys from debtors in order to \"enable[] courts to carefully scrutinize compensation paid to debtors' attorneys, providing protection to debtors and creditors and preventing overreaching by attorneys.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 892-93 (citing <i>Jensen v. United States Trustee (In re Smitty's Truck Stop, Inc.),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2000197\"><a href=\"/opinion/2000197/in-re-smittys-truck-stop-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>, 848 (10th Cir. BAP 1997)). This court also held that \"[t]he failure to comply with the disclosure rules is a sanctionable violation, even if proper disclosure would have shown that the attorney had not actually violated any Bankruptcy Code provision or any Bankruptcy Rules[.]\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 893 (quoting <i>In re Campbell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1540700\"><a href=\"/opinion/1540700/in-re-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span>, 627 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2001)) (quoting <i>Neben &amp; Starrett, Inc. v. Chartwell Fin. Corp. (In re Park-Helena Corp.),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702379\"><a href=\"/opinion/702379/in-re-park-helena-corp-debtor-neben-starrett-inc-v-chartwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></a></span>, 880 (9th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p>As a result of its actions giving rise to the seven <i>Waldo</i> cases, Clark &amp; Washington was required to disgorge all attorneys' fees received from the debtors in those cases and was required to refund service charges collected for debtor checks that were returned for insufficient funds. Clark &amp; Washington disgorged all fees as required under <i>Waldo</i> and additionally voluntarily refunded $123,742.00 in actual or potential fees attributable to other similarly situated cases, by returning outstanding post-dated checks in its possession. COLL. TRIAL EX. 147 ¶ 8. Additionally, Clark &amp; Washington revised its Chapter 7 Attorney-Client Agreement (Engagement Contract)<sup>[4]</sup> with respect to its attorneys' fees to be paid for services rendered in association with its representation of debtors in Chapter 7 cases. <i>See</i> TRIAL EX. 100.</p>\n<p>As it relates to the issues raised in these fifteen contested matters, the initial Clark &amp; Washington post-<i>Waldo</i> six page, single-spaced engagement contract, which outlines the debtors' duties as well as those of Clark &amp; Washington, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> the following:</p>\n<blockquote>I. Pre-Petition Fees and Services:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>a. Attorney offers and advertises a free consultation to prospective bankruptcy clients. Much of that initial consultation involves information gathering and interviews with clients regarding their debts, assets, financial circumstances, and transactions. Consequently, a large portion of Client's case intake was performed during the initial consultation. There is no charge for this service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b. The balance of the pre-Petition fee covers the remaining services required to assist Client in obtaining their required credit counseling certificate, gathering necessary information and documents, advising Client regarding the legal issues involved in Client's case, advising Client of the upcoming process, advising Client of their responsibilities as a debtor, and preparing and filing Client's bankruptcy pleadings. The fee for these services is a flat fee of $____.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>ANY FEE RELATING TO PRE-PETITION SERVICES WHICH IS NOT PAID PRIOR TO THE FILING OF CLIENT'S CASE IS SUBJECT TO BEING DISCHARGED IN CLIENT'S CASE. ACCORDINGLY, ATTORNEY WILL WAIVE ANY ATTORNEY FEE FOR PRE-PETITION SERVICES WHICH HAS NOT BEEN PAID PRIOR <span class=\"star-pagination\">*617</span> TO THE FILING OF CLIENT'S PETITION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>II. Post-Petition Fees and Services:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>a. <i>Retainer.</i> As a condition of representation in this case, Client agrees to pay Attorney a retainer for services to be rendered post-Petition in Client's case. The retainer shall consist of post-dated checks in the total amount of $_____.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This retainer shall be applied to the post-Petition services to be rendered by Attorney in Client's case. These services include, but are not limited to, those services listed in paragraph b. below. The retainer is based upon a blended hourly rate of $165. The amount of the post-Petition fees shall be capped at the amount of the retainer listed above, regardless of the amount of services expended in excess thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The parties contemplate that the value of the post-Petition services rendered by Attorney in this case shall meet or exceed the total amount of the quoted retainer. Nonetheless, Client is entitled to request a final accounting of the fees charged by Attorney in this case and thereafter receive a refund of any amount of the retainer paid in excess of the value of the post-Petition services rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>CLIENT IS ADVISED THAT THE USE OF POST-DATED CHECKS FOR POST-PETITION PAYMENT OF A <i>PRE-PETITION</i> CHAPTER 7 ATTORNEY FEE IS NOT ALLOWED IN THE MAJORITY OF JURISDICTIONS. TO ATTORNEY'S KNOWLEDGE, THE ACCEPTANCE OF POST-DATED CHECKS AS A RETAINER AGAINST SPECIFICALLY-SEGREGATED, <i>POST-PETITION</i> SERVICES HAS NOT BEEN DISALLOWED. NONETHELESS, CLIENT MIGHT WISH TO CONSULT INDEPENDENT COUNSEL IN THIS REGARD.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b. <i>Post-Petition Services:</i> The post-Petition services to be rendered by Attorney in Client's case include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>i. Notifying specific creditors of Client's case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>ii. Filing Notices of Stay in any other court or tribunal where an action is pending against Client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>iii. Mailing Client a copy of all petitions, notices and pleadings filed on Client's behalf;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>iv. Notifying Client of all court hearings, meetings, or other proceedings scheduled in Client's case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>v. Consulting with Client about any questions or problems that might arise relating to Client's case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>vi. Preparing for, attending, and representing Client in all required court hearings or other proceedings in Client's case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>vii. Preparing and filing any and all pleadings and other documents which are necessary or appropriate in the prosecution of Client's case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>viii. Advising Client of their responsibilities as a debtor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>ix. Assisting/advising Client in carrying-out their statement of intentions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>x. Assisting Client in obtaining and filing the required pre-discharge financial management certificate; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>xi. Assisting Client in cooperating with requests by the panel trustee, UST, or the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>c. <i>\"CarveOuts\"</i>:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>i. These fees do not include court filing costs. Client shall be responsible for all court and credit counseling costs associated with this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*618</span> ii. Client agrees to pay an additional fee of $100.00 plus applicable court costs for each amendment filed, post-petition, to include, list, or disclose any information which Client failed to provide to Attorney prior to the filing of Client's case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>iii. Adversary Proceedings: the parties specifically agree that the services contemplated in this contract of employment DO NOT include representing Client, either as a Plaintiff or Defendant, in any adversary proceeding filed in or in connection with this case. Should Attorney agree to represent Client in an adversary proceeding, a different contract of employment shall be executed between the parties under such terms and conditions as the parties deem mutually acceptable. If Client is served with an adversary proceeding complaint, Attorney shall take appropriate steps to protect Client's best interests until such time as either Client informs Attorney that Client does not wish to litigate the matter, Client declines to retain Attorney, Client obtains other counsel, or Attorney is allowed to withdraw by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p>TRIAL EX. 100. At trial, Mr. Thomas testified that he personally drafted the \"straddle\" contract at the end of October 2009, in an attempt to comply with the court's directives in <i>Waldo</i> by removing the non-refundable nature of the fees, adding the language advising that pre-petition attorneys' fees were potentially subject to discharge, adding the language concerning the potential conflict with taking post-dated checks in some jurisdictions, and removing all carve-outs other than adversary proceedings and post-petition amendments. Believing that the \"straddle\" contract was in compliance with <i>Waldo</i> and after instituting the new engagement arrangements, Clark &amp; Washington's Knoxville office once again began accepting, as one of its methods for payment of attorneys' fees, post-dated checks from debtors in addition to payments from third parties, payment in full prior to filing, or providing services pro bono. JT. STIPS. ¶ 2.</p>\n<p>Approximately three weeks later, Mr. Thomas once again revised Clark &amp; Washington's engagement contract, removing subsection ii. accessing the additional fee for filing amendments contained in the \"CarveOuts\" section, stating it did not fit in with the spirit of a \"straddle\" contract and that it caused problems with their clients. <i>See</i> TRIAL EX. 101. No other changes were made to the second post-<i>Waldo</i> form Chapter 7 Attorney Client Agreement, and the firm continued taking post-dated checks from debtors as payment for Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>After noting that Clark &amp; Washington was continuing to take post-dated checks from debtors, drawn on their bank accounts, the court entered an Order in <i>Hart</i> on December 8, 2009, directing Mr. Burroughs and Clark &amp; Washington to appear and show cause why their compensation should not be limited to the $201.00 received from the Debtors pre-petition, why they should not be required to return all post-dated checks to the Debtors, and why the court should not summarily disallow all compensation purportedly paid by post-dated checks and direct the return thereof to the respective debtors in all Chapter 7 cases filed after entry of the <i>Waldo</i> decision on October 27, 2009. As required by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*619</span> the court in its show cause order, Mr. Burroughs and Clark &amp; Washington filed a brief on January 7, 2010, arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that they had attempted to comply with the court's directives in <i>Waldo</i> and that the post-dated checks received from the Debtors were a retainer against post-petition services.</p>\n<p>On March 19, 2010, the U.S. Trustee filed the Motion for Sanctions and Other Relief Against the Law Firm of Clark &amp; Washington and Attorney Zachary Burroughs and Notice of Hearing (First Motion for Sanctions) in <i>Lawson, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe, Womble, Aaron,</i> and <i>Knight,</i> asking the court to enter an order finding Mr. Burroughs and Clark &amp; Washington in contempt and ordering them to disgorge any prepaid or post-paid fees collected for filing inaccurate compensation disclosure statements, for failing to adequately disclose that unpaid attorneys' fees were potentially dischargeable, and for violating the court's decision in <i>Waldo.</i><sup>[6]</sup> Additionally, the U.S. Trustee requested sanctions such as requiring all compensation disclosure statements filed by Clark &amp; Washington to contain an original signature of a partner, shareholder, or principal, requiring the firm to filing an accounting of all billable time for non-flat fee cases, requiring fifteen additional CLE hours for each attorney in the firm's Knoxville office, assignment of a court-approved co-counsel to review all filings by Clark &amp; Washington, and suspension from practicing before the court for a time to be determined.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, on April 1, 2010, the U.S. Trustee filed the Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 105(a) Against Clark &amp; Washington, P.C., and Zachary Burroughs for Violations of Local Rule 2090-2 and General Order 2008-005 (Second Motion for Sanctions) in <i>Lawson, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe,</i> and <i>Womble,</i> asking the court to find Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs in violation of the Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct for failing to obtain an original signature from the Debtors prior to filing the amended Statement of Financial Affairs on March 4, 2010. The U.S. Trustee requested imposition of sanctions, including suspension of the firm's electronic signature filing privileges, requiring the firm's attorneys to complete additional CLE courses, and suspension of Clark &amp; Washington's attorneys from practice before the court for a time period to be determined.</p>\n<p>Following the filing of the Second Motion for Sanctions, the court entered an Order directing Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs to file a response by April 15, 2010. The Response of Clark and Washington, P.C. and Zachary Burroughs to U.S. Trustee's Motions for Sanctions (Response) was filed on April 12, 2010. In the Response, Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs acknowledged that they filed inaccurate initial Compensation Disclosure Statements in <i>Lawson, Hart, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe, McGee,</i> and <i>Womble,</i> but contended the errors were inadvertent and corrected when they filed amended Compensation Disclosure Statements. Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs also acknowledged that in <i>Lawson, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe,</i> and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*620</span> <i>Womble,</i> they filed amended Statements of Financial Affairs without first obtaining handwritten signatures from the Debtors and that doing so was wrong but denied that they intended to mislead the court. With respect to the sanctions sought by the U.S. Trustee, Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs averred that they had taken steps to ensure that neither error occurred in the future, including changes to their procedure for filing compensation disclosure statements subject to review by a partner. Additionally, they agreed that disgorgement was an appropriate supplemental sanction to their self-imposed sanction whereby they previously disgorged $123,742.00 in fees in an attempt to comply with the <i>Waldo</i> opinion but argued that any additional sanctions sought by the U.S. Trustee are not necessary or appropriate.</p>\n<p>All matters raised in the U.S. Trustee's Motions for Sanctions, the <i>McGee</i> Motion, and the court's show cause order in <i>Hart</i> were consolidated for trial at the preliminary hearing and continued hearings held on April 22 and May 13, 2010, respectively. Pursuant to the Pretrial Order entered on May 14, 2010, and amended on July 1, 2010, the issues the court was called upon to resolve are summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>A. whether, since Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs acknowledged that the Rule 2016(b) compensation disclosure statements filed with the court in <i>Lawson, Hart, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe, McGee,</i> and <i>Womble</i> did not accurately reflect the fee arrangements with the respective Debtors, disgorgement is the appropriate sanction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B. whether the Chapter 7 Attorney-Client Agreement utilized by Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs and executed by the Debtors in <i>Zick, Hart, Newman,</i> and <i>Sanchez</i> violated <i>Waldo;</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>C. whether the Chapter 7 Attorney-Client Agreement for Routine Cases Under 11 U.S.C.

In response to questions concerning their attorney fee arrangements with Clark &amp; Washington, and specifically regarding the payment of those fees through third-party post-dated checks, Ms. Lawson testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. So the first time you met with them [Clark &amp; Washington], about the second <span class=\"star-pagination\">*624</span> or third week of October, that you just discussed the fee arrangement, and what did they tell you that arrangement would be, besides the amount?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. That at that point, you all hadn't decided on the law. He said that it was just they could do five posted checks at $160 a month from us. And then when we came back the second time, which technically would be the first time for filing the petition, that's when they told us about the law, and that it had to be a third party. So then we came back a third time with our third party checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now let's talk about those third-party checks. Who was the third party that wrote the checks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. A friend of ours. Jordan Perlioni.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. And did he offer to pay for your bankruptcy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No, ma'am. We have to pay him back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now how do you pay him back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. We pay him back with cash. We just take it out of our budget for the whole month and give it to him, and then he puts hisputs that cash into the account where the checks are coming out of, and it gets paid that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. So he didn't really offer to make the payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. So why do you suppose you had to do this with a third-party check? I mean having it from a friend, when you're actually making the payment yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, from what they toldwhat Mitch [Chessman] told us was that our debt, our attorney's fees, would be canceled out in the bankruptcy. And then at that point, I'm assuming that people weren't paying their attorney's fees like they had originally agreed to. So the third party which we had gone to and said, \"hey can you help us with this,\" and we made the agreement with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. So in fact he's not really paying your bankruptcy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No. He's justhis name is on the check.</blockquote>\n<p>COLL. TRIAL EX. 11 [K. Lawson] pg. 8, ln. 10-pg. 10, ln. 9. Ms. Lawson's testimony was echoed by Mr. Lawson, who testified that Mr. Perleoni, a long-time friend, provided them with the post-dated checks at their request after they were advised by Clark &amp; Washington that the options for payment of the attorney fees were either in full up front or through a third party:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. And did you ask him if he could fund you the money to pay up front for your bankruptcy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. The way I'd explained it to him is that we needed the third-party checks and that I would give him the money before the check cleared to make sure it was in his account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Who made that suggestion that you do it that way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I'm not sure I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Well, did someone suggest to you that you could get a third-partyyou could just agree to make payments to them and let them provide the checks, or did you come up with that idea all by yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. We were told that the attorney's office would need third-party checks toeither up front or a third party. We were explained that it couldn't be our post-dated checks. I called Jordan on the phone and told him what the deal was and told him, just to let you know, I'm going [to] make sure the moneyor I'm going to give you the money before the checks clear. That way he doesn't <span class=\"star-pagination\">*625</span> have to worry about making sure his money is there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Did you call him from the attorney's office or from your home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I believe I called him from the attorney's office, right after we spoke to them and they told me that they would need third-party checks.</blockquote>\n<p>COLL. TRIAL EX. 11 [J. Lawson] pg. 4, ln. 17-pg. 6, ln. 2.</p>\n<p>During the Rule 2004 examination, the Lawsons identified and/or reviewed their contract with Clark &amp; Washington and, with respect to what they understood the contract to provide as to the attorney fees they were paying, Ms. Lawson testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. When you met with your attorneys, did they tell you how much they were going to charge you for doing the pre-petition workthat means the work up until they filed your caseand how much they were going to charge you for the post-petition work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. They just said everything would be in that $800. Everything would be included in that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. So they told you that was a flat fee for filing the bankruptcy basically?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. For the initial filing. If we had to do an amendment or anything like that, there were additional fees, which I believe I've got a copy of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And do you recall that the terms were in this document that you would pay $800a pre-petition fee of $800 that covers the remaining services? Is that correct?....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. And as for post-petition fees and services, the amount was zero, wasn't it? There's nothing there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. There'sthey said the $800 would cover all of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. They didn't specify exactly how much went to which.</blockquote>\n<p>COLL.

That's what it sounds like. I don't know if that's true or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now I want you to look down at the next paragraph, paragraph 2. It talks about post-petition fees and services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And it talks about a retainer, and it shows that  it says that the retainer shall consist of post-dated checks in the total amount of $1,100, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q.  because it does have the numbers in there. And it says here that the retainer </blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I do recall that, yes. I do recall that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now, let's look at this next paragraph. I want you to read it out loud for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*639</span> A. This retainer shall be applied to the post-petition services to be rendered by attorney in client's name. These services include, but are not limited to those services listed in paragraph 8 below. The retainer is based upon a blended hourly rate of $165. The amount of post-petition fees should be capped at the time of the retainer listed above regardless of the amount of services expended in the excess thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now, what do you think that means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, it sounds to me like we agree on that amount to get the job done no matter what it takes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. But that's the amount. Do you understand what it means to have an hourly rate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now, tell me what  how do you think that </blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Well, that's like $175 per  $165 per hour, however many hours it takes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Now I want you to read this next paragraph to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Okay. The parties contemplate that the value of the post-petition services rendered by attorney in this case shall meet or exceed the total amount of the quoted retainer. Nonetheless, client is entitled to request a final accounting of the fees charged by attorney in this case and thereafter receive a refund of any amount of the retainer paid in excess of the value of the post-petition services rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. Have you  do you understand the implication of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. That says that if it was a real quick and simple process and didn't take a lot of their time, unless there were charges that they can show me they had to pay, I might get some of that $1,100 back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Right. Did you understand that before you just read that now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No, I can't tell you that I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay.

Did you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I understand it now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. But you didn't understand it then. Did they explain  sit down and explain that that $1,100 was subject to an hourly rate and only  they would only bill according to how much time they spent on your case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Dickerson] We were told that it was going to cost this amount, and that's why we did the post-dated checks. And we were supposed to read that.

Specifically, whether the post-<i>Waldo</i> engagement contracts and fee arrangements employed by Clark &amp; Washington and implemented by Mr. Burroughs as managing attorney for its Knoxville office constitute true \"straddle\" arrangements for the division of pre- and post-petition fees and services in compliance with the directives of <i>Waldo.</i><sup>[57]</sup></p>\n<p>One of the primary issues in <i>Waldo</i> was whether or not the engagement contract and fee arrangement between Clark &amp; Washington and the respective debtors under the terms of which the firm collected, pre-petition, post-dated checks drawn on debtor accounts for deposit post-petition constituted pre-petition debts, subject to discharge. After analyzing case law from this jurisdiction, as well as others, this court concluded that \"the attorneys' fees in each case [were] flat fees which arose pre-petition, irrespective of when services were to be rendered.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 883; <i>see also </i><i>In re Griffin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2005326\"><a href=\"/opinion/2005326/in-re-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></a></span>, 762-63 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.2004) (\"Under the Bankruptcy Code, a contract-based claim is a pre-petition claim if prior to filing[,] the relationship between the debtors and the creditor contained all the necessary elements to create a right to payment under the relevant contract.\"). This court went on to then state the following:</p>\n<blockquote>[A]cceptance of post-dated checks for payment of \"flat-fee\" or \"no-look\" attorney's fees is not an acceptable practice and runs afoul of the Bankruptcy Code <span class=\"star-pagination\">*664</span> and Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, [and finds] the division of a flat fee arrangement into pre-petition and post-petition parts to be conceptually inconsistent and therefore untenable. The Court therefore joins those other courts which hold that when a flat or fixed fee pre-petition agreement is at issue, the fee must be paid in full prior to the commencement of the debtor's case or the fee is discharged under § 727(b).</blockquote>\n<p><i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 882, 885 (quoting <i>In re Mansfield,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1834059\"><a href=\"/opinion/1834059/in-re-mansfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span>, 791 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.2008)). In summary, this court held that \"because `flat fee' or `no-look' attorney's fees contracted for pre-petition are dischargeable, it is unacceptable for attorneys to ask for and receive post-dated checks from Debtors to be cashed post-petition as payment of those fees.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 886.</p>\n<p>Recognizing, however, that attorneys should be compensated for the services they provide, this court, at the conclusion of the <i>Waldo</i> opinion, gave the following three examples of potentially allowable methods for payment of attorneys' fees in Chapter 7 cases: \"(1) requiring Chapter 7 debtors to pay `flat' or `no-look' attorney's fees in full prior to filing; (2) revising retainer agreements and expressly designating pre-petition services, which are paid pre-petition, and post-petition services, which shall be paid post-petition; or (3) accepting payments by third parties.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 895.</p>\n<p>Immediately following entry of the <i>Waldo</i> decision, Mr. Thomson drafted the initial post-<i>Waldo</i> contract, and Mr. Crawford, the managing attorney of the Knoxville office at that time, instructed the Knoxville office to stop taking post-dated debtor checks. That practice was resumed, however, after Mr. Crawford left the firm in November 2009, and Mr. Burroughs was instructed by the Atlanta office to begin taking post-dated debtor checks once again under the post-<i>Waldo</i> \"straddle\" contract, continuing until January 2010, when Mr. Clark instructed the Knoxville office to only take post-dated third party checks.<sup>[58]</sup> Additionally, Mr. Burroughs testified that although the Knoxville office ceased collecting post-dated checks written on debtor accounts, it continued depositing post-dated checks received prior to entry of the <i>Waldo</i> decision and it has continued depositing post-dated checks written on debtor accounts in its possession.</p>\n<p>In support of Clark &amp; Washington's post-<i>Waldo</i> \"straddle\" contract, Mr. Thomson testified that in the immediate aftermath of the <i>Waldo</i> opinion, he instructed all of the Knoxville offices not to take post-dated debtor checks for a few days and began drafting a revised engagement contract that provided for receipt of post-dated checks pre-petition in contemplation of post-petition services while correcting the major three problems pointed out by the court. To that end, the initial and second post-<i>Waldo</i> engagement contracts both remove a statement that attorneys' fees are nonrefundable, remove all carveouts other than for adversary proceedings and amendments, segregate pre-petition and post-petition services, add language advising that pre-petition debts are subject to discharge, and add language that debtors may consult other counsel concerning the acceptability of post-dated checks. <i>See</i> TRIAL EX. 100; TRIAL EX. 101. These contracts also provided for debtors to pay a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*665</span> minimal flat fee, usually $150.00, when the contract was signed, with that amount designated for pre-petition services, and to pay the remaining balance of the fees due via post-dated checks, with that amount designated for post-petition services. <i>See</i> TRIAL EX. 100; TRIAL EX. 101. These are the engagement contracts executed by all of the Debtors in these contested matters with the exception of the Soleses, who executed the pre-<i>Waldo</i> contract.</p>\n<p>In spite of the assertions by Mr. Thomson, Mr. Clark, Mr. Burroughs, and Ms. Stofan to the contrary, neither of the post-<i>Waldo</i> engagement contracts is a true \"straddle\" agreement and neither complies with <i>Waldo.</i> Regardless of Clark &amp; Washington's purported attempt to bifurcate the attorneys' fees into pre- and post-petition services, the fact remains that each of the Engagement Contracts in these fifteen cases was entered into pre-petition, as was the obligation for payment. Each Engagement Contract is prefaced with the phrase, \"Client agrees to pay the following fees\" and then fixes the liability of the respective Debtors at the full amount of the pre- and post-petition figures inserted into the respective Engagement Contracts. As stated in <i>Waldo,</i> \"[i]f these arrangements were true `saddle obligations' as argued by Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Crawford, they would not collect post-dated checks pre-petition in anticipation of post-petition services but would, instead, seek payment for post-petition services as rendered post-petition.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 883-84. The engagement contracts themselves, as well as the testimony at trial can lead to no other conclusionthese are \"flat fee\" contracts.</p>\n<p>The post-<i>Waldo</i> engagement contracts attempt to bifurcate fees, advising clients that they have paid their \"minimal flat fee\" for pre-petition fees<sup>[59]</sup> and that they, \"[a]s a condition of representation,\" have agreed to pay \"a retainer for services to be rendered post-petition\" to consist of post-dated checks totaling the remaining amount. <i>See</i> COLL.

The engagement contracts then go on to provide that the retainer will be applied to post-petition services and \"is based upon a blended hourly rate of $165\" with the fees \"capped at the amount of the retainer listed above, regardless of the amount of services expended in excess thereof\" and that \"[t]he parties contemplate that the value of the post-petition services rendered ... shall meet or exceed the total amount of the quoted retainer.\" <i>See</i> COLL.

JT. STIPS. ¶ 5. Additionally, Clark &amp; Washington does not routinely provide itemized statements or accountings of post-petition services to debtors. In fact, Mr. Burroughs testified that only one debtor has asked for an accounting and only after an inquiry by the U.S. Trustee's office. Ms. Stofan testified that none of the firm's Chattanooga clients has requested an accounting, nor has that office ever provided a client with an itemized statement of services rendered. JT. STIPS. ¶ 9.</p>\n<p>As for what each of the Debtors understood, their testimony clearly evidences that each of them thought that they were paying a flat fee for their bankruptcy case. When asked how much Clark &amp; Washington was going to charge for doing the pre-petition work and how much would be charged for the post-petition work, Ms. Lawson testified that it wasn't specified that a certain amount would be designated for either, but that \"[t]hey just said everything would be in that $800.00. Everything would be included in that.\" COLL. TRIAL EX. 11 [K. Lawson] at pg. 15, ln. 11-22; pg. 18, ln. 15-pg. 19, ln. 6. Similarly, Ms. Newman testified that she did not realize she would be charged different amounts for the work performed by Clark &amp; Washington pre-petition and post-petition, that she understood the entire fee to cover everything. TRIAL EX. 30 pg. 213, ln. 4-11. Ms. Dickerson testified that she understood that the attorney fee would cover their whole bankruptcy. TRIAL EX. 17 pg. 187, ln. 17-pg. 188, ln. 10. Ms. Zick testified that she simply thought the cost of her bankruptcy was a thousand or so dollars. TRIAL EX. 25 pg. 13, ln. 1-8. Ms. Woods' mother testified that she and her daughter understood the fee to be $1,250.00 for the entire bankruptcy case. TRIAL EX. 47 pg. 160, ln. 22-pg. 161, ln. 5. Ms. Sanchez testified that she and Mr. Sanchez were actually quoted $1,250.00 as the entire fee for filing their case by the person they met with at Clark &amp; Washington, as did Mr. Cox, Mr. Hoffman, Ms. Vittetoe, the McGees, and Ms. Womble, TRIAL EX. 37 pg. 11, ln. 6-19; TRIAL EX. 69 pg. 220, ln. 5-20; COLL.

Additionally, Mr. Aaron testified at his meeting of creditors that all he remembered was that he had to pay $350.00 in advance plus provide post-dated checks totaling $1,250.00. TRIAL EX. 79 pg. 163, ln. 14-pg. 164, ln. 14.</p>\n<p>When questioned about the retainer at trial, Mr. Burroughs testified that, pursuant to the terms of the engagement contracts, any unused portions should be refunded. He then stated, however, that Clark &amp; Washington attorneys and paralegals do not keep track of their time and do not bill at an hourly rate and that the firm has not returned any unused retainers to debtors. Additionally, Mr. Burroughs testified that the Debtors were aware, on the dates they signed their contracts, the total amount of attorneys' fee to be charged, inclusive of both the $150.00 pre-petition fee and the agreed upon post-petition \"retainer\" in the form of post-dated checks, and that receipt of payment in full of that retainer, through post-dated debtor or third-party checks, was a condition of and prerequisite to Clark &amp; Washington filing any debtor's case. Similarly, Mr. Thomson <span class=\"star-pagination\">*667</span> testified that each Debtors' obligation to pay the entire amount of fees arose at the time the contract was executed and if not paid, the non-paying debtors would have been in breach of contract.</p>\n<p>With respect to his Affidavit introduced into evidence as Trial Exhibit 97, Mr. Burroughs testified that he did not personally compile the time records attached thereto, but that paralegals in his firm estimated the time amounts based upon notes contained in a database kept by Clark &amp; Washington, after which Mr. Burroughs reviewed the records and made revisions. No time records were kept within the database, and all time entries were based on estimates assigned by the paralegals who prepared the attachments. His testimony was corroborated by Ms. Stofan, who testified that although the \"straddle\" contract provides for a blended hourly rate of $165.00 for attorneys and paralegals, she has never established an hourly rate and does not keep time records. Significantly, the time estimates were prepared pursuant to the court's directives set forth in the Pretrial Order entered on May 14, 2010, and not periodically as each case progressed. The $165.00 \"blended hourly rate\" allegedly charged by Clark &amp; Washington for post-petition services appears to be nothing more than a convenient figure to be utilized in estimating the post-petition fees in the unlikely event a debtor should request an accounting. However, as evidenced by the court's calculations set forth earlier in each Debtors' factual section, the $165.00 \"blended hourly rate\" is merely a fiction. Clearly, Clark &amp; Washington never intended to account to these Debtors for the unused portion of any attorneys' fee.</p>\n<p>Mr. Thomson's and Mr. Burroughs's testimony that the \"straddle\" contract provides a true breakdown between pre- and post-petition fees is also contradicted by the receipts issued to the respective debtors in each case which contains a blocked-off section providing the following information:</p>\n<blockquote>PERSONAL CHECK POLICY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1. Checks are verified prior to filing your case</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. Your case will not be filed until the full amount due is paid in advance</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. No personal checks if you have NSF Debts</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. There will be a $25.00 charge for each returned check</blockquote>\n<blockquote>5.

TRIAL EX. 83.<sup>[60]</sup> The receipts, with the exception of the Harts' and McGees', contradicts Mr. Burroughs's testimony that Clark &amp; Washington's Knoxville office does not pursue its clients for payment on post-dated checks returned for insufficient funds. Also, with the exception of the <i>Hart</i> and <i>McGee</i> cases, item 6 contravenes the provision in each Engagement Contract that \"Client is entitled to ... receive a refund of any amount of the retainer paid in excess of the value of the post-Petition services rendered.\" <i>See</i> TRIAL EX. 9; TRIAL EX. 15; TRIAL EX. 22; COLL.

Under no type of contract will the court condone acceptance of post-dated checks from debtors written on their accounts, to be cashed post-petition, as payment of attorneys' fees. As discussed in detail, \"there are serious ethical implications in such a practice,\" raising \"the question and the appearance\" of a conflict of interest between Clark &amp; Washington and the affected debtors. <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 886-87.<sup>[61]</sup> Clark &amp; Washington's attempts to camouflage its flat fee by bifurcating it into a minimal pre-petition amount and a much larger post-petition amount is disingenuous at best, especially in light of the evidence that in none of the cases presently before the court did the assigned time for services rendered come anywhere close to equaling the \"retainer\" amount multiplied by the $165.00 \"blended hourly rate.\"</p>\n<p>The court also finds the practice of accepting post-dated checks from third parties to be suspect and borderline violative of the Bankruptcy Code's prohibition on advising debtors to incur debt in anticipation of filing for bankruptcy. Section 526(a) states that debt relief agencies including attorneysshall not do any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) fail to perform any service that such agency informed an assisted person or prospective assisted person it would provide in connection with a case or proceeding under this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) make any statement, or counsel or advise any assisted person or prospective assisted person to make a statement in a document filed in a case or proceeding under this title, that is untrue and misleading, or that upon the exercise of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*669</span> reasonable care, should have been known by such agency to be untrue or misleading;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) misrepresent to any assisted person or prospective assisted person, directly or indirectly, affirmatively or by material omission, with respect to</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(A) the services that such agency will provide to such person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) the benefits and risks that may result if such person becomes a debtor in a case under this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(4) advise an assisted person or prospective assisted person to incur more debt in contemplation of such person filing a case under this title or to pay an attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fee or charge for services performed as part of preparing for or representing a debtor in a case under this title.</blockquote>\n<p>11 U.S.C. § 526(a); <i>see</i> 11. U.S.C. § 101(12A) (2006) (defining \"debt relief agency\" in material part as \"any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration[.]\"); <i>Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P.A. v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1728\"><a href=\"/opinion/1728/milavetz-gallop-milavetz-p-a-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span> (2010). In <i>Milavetz,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"§ 526(a)(4)[, which is best understood to provide an additional safeguard against the practice of loading up on debt prior to filing,] prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising a debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for bankruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose.\" <i>Milavetz,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1336.</p>\n<p>Without finding conclusively that Clark &amp; Washington has violated § 526(a)(4), the court is nevertheless troubled by the acceptance of third-party post-dated checks. With respect to the firm's procedure concerning third party checks, Mr. Burroughs testified that debtors are advised that they can ask a family member or neighbor to \"gift\" them the attorneys' fee, with the understanding that there is no requirement for the debtors to repay them, but that he never advised clients to take out a pre-petition loan from any source to fund the attorneys' fees. He also testified that there is no pre-petition, dischargeable debt owed to the third parties because the fee is earned and paid post-petition. Likewise, Mr. Thomson argued that acceptance of third-party post-dated checks, as well as any attempts to collect upon them, does not violate <i>Waldo</i> because §§ 362(a) and 524(a) do not apply to such payments made by third parties.</p>\n<p>Messrs. Burroughs and Thomson's testimony, however, contradicts testimony offered by the various Debtors with respect to what was intended when they were advised by Clark &amp; Washington to tender third-party post-dated checks. For example, Ms. Lawson testified that she and her husband are reimbursing Mr. Perlioni, the family friend who wrote the post-dated checks for their bankruptcy case, with cash and that he never intended to `gift' them the money or to pay for their attorneys' fees. COLL. TRIAL EX. 11 [K. Lawson] pg. 8, ln. 10-pg. 10, ln. 9. Similarly, Mr. Cox testified that his girlfriend provided the post-dated checks but it was never intended that she would pay for his bankruptcy case. TRIAL EX. 69 pg. 223, ln. 13-22; pg. 230, ln. 18-pg. 231, ln. 9. Likewise, Ms. Vittetoe testified that her mother-in-law had provided the post-dated checks, but she and Mr. Vittetoe were repaying her the $223.80 prior to each check clearing the bank, TRIAL EX. 75 pg. 108, ln. 22-pg. 109, ln. 5; pg. 110, ln. 7-pg. 111, ln. 6, and Ms. Womble testified that she had agreed to repay her mother, from whom she had received the post-dated checks, when each one cleared the bank. Trial Ex. 57, pg. 33, ln. 14-21.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*670</span> Even more telling as to the true nature of these third-party payments, the Luttrells testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. So your attorneys told you you couldn't write your own post-dated checks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Ms. Luttrell] At first, when we met with them in December, they said that we could do our own post-dated checks, but when we met with them again in January they said that that was not going to work anymore, that we could either, I guess, I don't know if they said we could pay it all up front</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Luttrell] Yeah, we could pay it up front</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Ms. Luttrell]or we could do third-party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Luttrell]or we could do third-party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Ms. Luttrell] And that's what we chose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Luttrell] And they would hold the checks and we could bring the money in and they would, you know, get the checkwe could get the checks back or whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Ms. Luttrell] Or they would shred them through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Luttrell] So we just let them run them through and we pay her sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And have you paid her sister any payments yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Mr. Luttrell] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. [Ms. Luttrell] Yes. One check's went through and we paid for it.</blockquote>\n<p>TRIAL EX. 63, pg. 49, ln. 10-pg. 50, ln. 9. Similarly, Mr. Aaron testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. And so when you met with them did they talk to you about how you could pay your fees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. And what werewhat did they tell you about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. They told me I could pay it third-party by having, you know, one of my relatives give them five checks, they can put it through the bank or I could come up there and pay them off asas they come due, three days before they come due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. They told youdid youdid youdid the thirdwas the third party named James Carey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And did Mr. Carey give you the money or did he loan you the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. He loaned me the checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. He loaned you the checks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Didwhat was your intent about the checks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I'd pay them off beforeyou know, go ahead and pay them off as Iyou know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Did Clark &amp; Washington tell you that you could arrange it that way, where you'd come up and pick up the checks before they were cashed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Okay. They told you. Were they aware that you were just borrowing these checks</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q.from Mr. Carey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p>TRIAL EX. 79 pg. 164, ln. 4-pg. 165, ln. 9. In fact, as can be gleaned from the Debtors' testimony, it appears that not only did Clark &amp; Washington know that manyif not a majorityof debtors using third-party checks were, in fact, repaying those third parties, but Clark &amp; Washington, through its attorneys and staff, were instructing debtors to bring in post-dated checks from third-parties while advising <span class=\"star-pagination\">*671</span> them that, if they so desired, the debtors themselves could come in and replace the postdated checks with cash prior to the dates upon which the checks were to be deposited.</p>\n<p>To state it plainly, the court finds that a pre-petition contract which fixes or predetermines the total amount of the fee a debtor is required to pay for both pre-and post-petition services establishes a \"flat fee\" under the authority of Waldo, and the collecting of post-dated checks is prohibited, irrespective of the source. As discussed, a true \"saddle\" contract contemplates a billing relationship, wherein services are rendered post-petition and the client is billed an hourly rate post-petition based upon the time spent, after the services have actually been performed. None of the Engagement Contracts in these contested matters complies with this basic concept and none complies with the court's decision in <i>Waldo.</i><sup>[62]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>With respect to the second category, the inaccurate Compensation Disclosure Statements and unsigned Amended Statements of Financial Affairs filed by Clark &amp; Washington, the court finds that although Clark &amp; Washington has acknowledged its mistakes, the fact remains that it did not take the care and attention necessary to ensure that the documents it filed with the court were accurate and properly filed. The statutory authority and procedural rules relating to the disclosure of compensation were fully addressed in <i>Waldo.</i> The court examined the combined role played by § 329(a) and Rule 2016(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure in providing a system for monitoring of attorneys' fees, allowing courts to \"carefully scrutinize\" compensation paid by debtors and stressed that full and accurate disclosure was \"mandatory\" and \"`[a]nything less than the full measure of disclosure' is unacceptable.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 893 (citations omitted). As such, it is not necessary for the court to revisit these issues again in great detail other than to reiterate that \"[t]he failure to comply with the disclosure rules is a sanctionable violation, even if proper disclosure would have shown that the attorney had not actually violated any Bankruptcy Rules, and sanctions may also be imposed for negligent or inadvertent failures to disclose.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 893 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs do not deny that they filed inaccurate Rule 2016(b) compensation disclosure statements in the <i>Lawson, Hart, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe, McGee,</i> and <i>Womble</i> cases. Mr. Burroughs testified that following entry of the <i>Hart</i> show cause order, he discovered errors on several of the Rule 2016(b) Compensation Disclosure Statements, and he filed amended disclosures for all Chapter 7 cases filed by Clark &amp; Washington post-<i>Waldo</i> to remove the straddle contract language, which had been inserted on the firm-wide template by its main office in Atlanta. The court's review of the Compensation Disclosure Statements in these contested matters not only confirms that the original disclosures made by Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs in each case were incomplete, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*672</span> but also that, notwithstanding Mr. Burroughs's attempts to correct them, the Amended Compensation Disclosure Statements he filed still do not reflect the true nature of the respective Debtors' Engagement Contracts. In fact, as of the date of this Memorandum, Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs still have not provided full and accurate disclosure of the firm's fee arrangements with some of these Debtors.</p>\n<p>Mr. Burroughs also testified that he had a conversation with the attorney for the U.S. Trustee, who brought it to his attention that the original Statements of Financial Affairs in many of the cases were inaccurate with respect to question 9, and that following that conversation, he prepared and filed Amended Statements of Financial Affairs on behalf of the Lawsons, the Harts, Ms. Newman, the Soleses, the Sanchezes, the Dickersons, Ms. Zick, the Luttrells, Ms. Vittetoe, and Ms. Womble in an attempt to more accurately reflect the payment arrangements, but in his haste to revise and file the Amended Statements of Financial Affairs, he did not send them to the respective Debtors for execution. Accordingly, he and Clark &amp; Washington do not deny that they filed the Amended Statement of Financial Affairs on behalf of the Debtors in the <i>Lawson, Newman, Soles, Sanchez, Dickerson, Zick, Cox, Hoffman, Luttrell, Vittetoe,</i> and <i>Womble</i> cases without first obtaining the Debtors' permission and handwritten signatures as required by section III.A.3 of the Administrative Procedures for Electronic Case Filing, effective May 17, 2005, as amended, which states in material part:</p>\n<blockquote>III.

As a result of their inaccurate disclosures in <i>Waldo,</i> Clark &amp; Washington was required to disgorge all fees received from the Debtors in those seven cases, making the decision to voluntarily return $123,742.00 in numerous other cases. And yet, within days after the <i>Waldo</i> opinion was entered, Clark &amp; Washington once again began filing inaccurate Rule 2016 Compensation Disclosure Statements which were followed by inaccurate Amended Compensation Disclosure Statements and subsequently by unverified and unauthorized Amended Statements of Financial Affairs.<sup>[67]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Although the majority of these issues were addressed and, in the court's mind, decided in <i>Waldo,</i> in order to avoid any further litigation as to what is and what is not allowed concerning fee arrangements in Chapter 7 cases and the disclosure of compensation requirements in all cases filed in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Northern Division, the court will summarize, reiterating much of what it has held previously.</p>\n<p>First, the Engagement Contracts entered into between Clark &amp; Washington and each of the fifteen Debtors creates a pre-petition obligation for payment of a lump sum or flat fee, and any portion of that lump sum or flat fee not paid to the firm pre-petition has been discharged in fourteen of these cases. The purported bifurcation of fees for pre- and post-petition services is a fiction, as is the concept that the Debtors paid a retainer to be applied against services rendered based upon the $165.00 \"blended hourly rate.\" It has been established that Clark &amp; Washington does not maintain time records for its clients and that it only created the estimated time records attached to Mr. Burroughs's Affidavit entered into evidence as Collective Trial Exhibit 97 after being directed to do so by the court. Additionally, it has been established that the amount of fees charged greatly exceeds the $165.00 \"blended hourly rate.\" Furthermore, as was evident from the testimony of the respective Debtors, none of them understood that they were to be paying under a bifurcated contract, but instead, each of them understood that the attorneys' fee charged by Clark &amp; Washington was a lump sum they were required to pay for the entire bankruptcy, to be tendered prior to filing.</p>\n<p>Second, in order to be a true \"straddle\" fee arrangement bifurcating pre- and post-petition services, the contract must clearly identify the services to be included within the pre-petition fee and the services to be included within the post-petition fee. It must also unambiguously disclose, at a minimum, that all pre-petition fees must be paid prior to filing and any unpaid pre-petition fee will be discharged and that all post-petition fees, which are not subject to the discharge, will be billed only when services are rendered and only for the specific amount of time for each activity at an agreed upon hourly rate for attorneys and a considerably lesser agreed upon hourly rate for paraprofessionals.<sup>[68]</sup> Attorneys may accept a pre-petition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*675</span> retainer to be billed against as long as the retainer is held in trust and drawn against as services are rendered, subject to time records being kept and debtors being periodically sent an itemized statement of the work performed and the retainer applied, without having to request the statement. Additionally, debtors must be made aware that they will receive any unused portion of the retainer once their case is concluded, again, without having to request it themselves.</p>\n<p>Third, it is unacceptable for attorneys to ask for and receive post-dated checks from debtors, irrespective of whether the checks are to be drawn on the debtors' personal accounts or a third party's account, and the payment of attorneys' fees through post-dated checks creates a conflict of interest under Rule 1.8(a) of the Tennessee Rules of Professional Responsibility. Additionally, the post-discharge deposit of any payments received from debtors or on their behalf for pre-petition fees may be, to the extent it could be considered an action to collect on a discharged debt, violative of the discharge injunction of 11 U.S.C. § 524(a).</p>\n<p>Fourth, Clark &amp; Washington and its Knoxville attorneys must file Compensation Disclosure Statements that accurately and fully reflect the fee arrangements with their clients. In the event the fee contract includes post-petition services, the nature of the anticipated services, hourly billing rate, and billing period should be disclosed. Additionally, each time an attorney receives post-petition compensation of any kind from or on behalf of a debtor, a supplemental Rule 2016(b) Compensation Disclosure Statement must be filed.</p>\n<p>Fifth, before filing any documents signed electronically by debtors, attorneys must have, in their possession, the original document containing the debtors' handwritten signature.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The court finds that Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs have either chosen to ignore the <i>Waldo</i> decision or to utilize less than creative methods to circumvent the court's ruling in <i>Waldo,</i> not only in these fifteen cases but in other Chapter 7 cases filed in behalf of their debtor-clients since October 27, 2009. Because the sanction of disgorgement has proved an insufficient deterrent, the court will enhance the sanctions as follows:</p>\n<p>1. Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs will, with the exception of the <i>McGee</i> case, No. 09-30353, be required to disgorge to the respective Debtors all attorney fees received pre- and post-petition and to return to the Debtors all post-dated checks, whether the Debtor or a third-party was the maker.</p>\n<p>2. Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs will be required to disgorge $300.00 to Joseph and April McGee in Case No. 10-30353 for their failure to file an accurate Compensation Disclosure Statement.</p>\n<p>3. Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs will be sanctioned the sum of $750.00 in all of these cases, with the exception of <i>McGee,</i> which sum is to be paid to the Clerk of the court for deposit to the United States Treasury.<sup>[69]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*676</span> 4. Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs shall be required to certify their compliance with paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 herein within 30 days.</p>\n<p>5. Clark &amp; Washington and its attorneys representing debtors in Chapter 7 cases hereafter filed in the court's Northern Division, shall, commencing 10 days after the entry of the Orders accompanying this Memorandum, be required to append the following declaration under penalty of perjury as an attachment to the Compensation Disclosure Statement:</p>\n<blockquote>I certify under penalty of perjury that prior to the signing of the employment contract by myself and the debtor[s] I was personally present while the debtor[s] read the contract; that I explained the agreed upon fee arrangement to the debtor[s]; that I inquired of the debtor[s] whether there were questions regarding the contract and fee arrangement, and answered those questions to the satisfaction of the debtor[s]; and that the compensation disclosure statement filed in this case correctly and accurately sets forth the fee agreement contained in the employment contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I also certify that the debtor[s], as required by Section III.A.3. of the Administrative Procedures for Electronic Case Filing, effective May 17, 2005, have actually signed a copy of all documents filed in this case containing an electronic signature.</blockquote>\n<p>The Compensation Disclosure Statement and Declaration shall both be dated and shall contain the signing attorney's handwritten signature.</p>\n<p>6. Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs shall, pursuant to Rules 9014(c) and 7054(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, be directed to pay all costs associated with the prosecution of these contested matters with the exception of <i>Hart.</i></p>\n<p>7. The obligations imposed on Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs in paragraph 5 above will remain in place for six (6) months unless, on motion of the United States Trustee filed prior to the expiration of the six (6) months, the court, for cause, extends this expiration date.</p>\n<p>Orders consistent with this memorandum will be entered in each case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Included among the stipulated exhibits are transcripts of examinations of various of the Debtors taken pursuant to Rule 2004 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and transcripts of testimony given by various of the Debtors at their creditors' meetings. The parties agreed that, rather than require the individual Debtors to testify, the court could consider their testimony as given during those proceedings.</p>\n<p>[2]  The firm has eight partners, seven of whom reside in Atlanta and one who resides in Tampa.</p>\n<p>[3]  For the purposes of this Memorandum, the court will refer collectively to Clark &amp; Washington's Knoxville offices as \"Knoxville office.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  In each section of this Memorandum, the court will refer to each Debtors' respective engagement agreement with Clark &amp; Washington as \"Engagement Contract\" and will not repeatedly designate this reference in the subsection for each Debtors' cases.</p>\n<p>[5]  Unless expressly stated otherwise in the individual subsections forthcoming, each of the Debtors entered into one of the two initial post-<i>Waldo</i> engagement contracts with Clark &amp; Washington, and it will be noted in each subsection which version of the contract was used for each of the Debtors.</p>\n<p>[6]  On that same date, in <i>Lawson, Newman, Sanchez, Dickerson,</i> and <i>Zick,</i> the U.S. Trustee filed an Amended Motion for Sanctions and Other Relief Against the Law Firm of Clark &amp; Washington and Attorney Zachary Burroughs and Notice of Hearing for the sole purpose of amending the caption and the certificate of service; however, no revisions or amendments were made to the motion or the U.S. Trustee's substantive argument.</p>\n<p>[7]  The amount is blank in the Engagement Contract entered into evidence as Trial Exhibit 9.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although the Lawsons executed their documents on November 3, 2009, the Voluntary Petition is dated November 10, 2009, the date upon which the case was filed. <i>See</i> COLL. TRIAL EX. 5. At trial, Mr. Burroughs testified that, due to an error in the software program, the dates defaulted to the filing date rather than the actual signature date.</p>\n<p>[9]  Question 9 directs debtors to \"[l]ist all payments made or property transferred by or on behalf of the debtor to any persons, including attorneys, for consultation concerning debt consolidation, relief under the bankruptcy law or preparation of the petition in bankruptcy within one year immediately preceding the commencement of [the] case.\" COLL.

TRIAL EX. 41. Exhibit \"B\" to the Engagement Contract lists the \"Non-Base Fees Services/A La Carte Items\" as follows, along with additional costs: (i) any contested matters including adversary proceedings, objections to exemptions, determinations of dischargeability, and objections to discharge  $295.00 per hour; (ii) reaffirmation agreements  $50.00 per agreement; (iii) redemptions  $350.00; (iv) amendments  $104.00; (v) judicial lien avoidances  $150.00; (vi) defense of motions for relief from stay or other motions  $245.00 per hour; (vii) more than 75 creditors  $50.00; (viii) miscellaneous letters  $50.00; (ix) emails/faxes to creditors  $15.00; (x) motions to reopen the case  $100.00; (xi) credit reports  $20.00 per Debtor; and (xii) retrieving closed records  $0.25 per page.

Should Attorney agree to represent Client in an adversary proceeding, a different contract of employment shall be executed between the parties under such terms and conditions as the parties deem mutually acceptable.</p>\n<p>TRIAL EX. 41. The court addressed these so-called \"carve-outs\" listed on Exhibit \"B\" in <i>Waldo</i> and found them \"particularly troublesome when Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Crawford have charged the Debtors fees ranging from $800.00 to $1,250.00, but now seek to exclude a majority of the services routinely performed post-petition from that flat fee.\" <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 885.</p>\n<p>[20]  <i>See supra</i> n. 8.

TRIAL EX. 76.</p>\n<p>[52]  The attachment to Mr. Burroughs's Affidavit for Mr. Aaron's case reflects a total of 5.2 hours, but that figure also includes 0.2 of an hour for receipting Mr. Aaron's replacement of a check with cash and 0.1 of an hour for time attributable to these contested matters.</p>\n<p>[53]  Mr. Aaron paid the entire $1,250.00 fee for post-petition services which, based upon the estimated time records, translates to an hourly rate of $781.25 for the 1.6 post-petition hours, including the 0.9 hour of actual attorney time estimated by Mr. Burroughs to have been spent on his case.</p>\n<p>[54]  <i>See supra</i> n. 8. Ms. Knight executed her documents on January 16, 2010, but the Voluntary Petition is dated February 5, 2010, the date upon which her case was filed. <i>See</i> COLL. TRIAL EX. 44.</p>\n<p>[55]  During the examination of the Debtor, Kalenda Knight, at her meeting of creditors on March 9, 2010, her mother, Katrina Woods, who was also present during the Debtor's consultation with representatives of Clark &amp; Washington, was sworn in and testified as to those events.</p>\n<p>[56]  Ms. Knight paid the entire $1,250.00 fee post-petition which, based upon the estimated time records, translates to an hourly rate of $694.44 for the 1.8 post-petition hours, including the 1.0 hour of actual attorney time estimated by Mr. Burroughs to have been spent on her case. That estimation not withstanding, at trial, Mr. Burroughs also identified the \"KB\" referenced in the estimated time records as having spent the one hour of attorney time meeting with Ms. Knight and her mother as Katherine Brown, who was a non-licensed attorney. <i>See supra</i> n. 22.</p>\n<p>[57]  The parties have stipulated that the contract used in the Soles case was a pre-<i>Waldo</i> contract and in violation of the court's directives therein. JT. STIPS. ¶ 7. At trial, Mr. Burroughs testified that the pre-<i>Waldo</i> engagement contract was mistakenly used; however, the Soleses' Engagement Contract was executed on October 22, 2009, prior to entry of the <i>Waldo</i> decision, but the case itself was filed post-<i>Waldo,</i> on December 14, 2009. <i>See</i> TRIAL EX. 41.</p>\n<p>[58]  Amanda Stofan, managing attorney for Clark &amp; Washington's Chattanooga office, testified that the \"straddle\" contract was used in Chattanooga from November 2009 through the end of April 2010, at which time that office stopped taking debtor post-dated checks as payment for its attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>[59]  With the exception of the Lawsons, for whom the entire $800.00 paid was stated to be their \"flat fee,\" and the Harts, for whom the \"flat fee\" was stated to be $201.00, the \"flat fee\" for the remaining Debtors executing post-<i>Waldo</i> engagement contracts was stated to be $150.00.</p>\n<p>[60]  Items 4 and 6 are not a part of the PERSONAL CHECK POLICY contents set forth in the receipts issued by Clark &amp; Washington to the Harts and the McGees. COLL. TRIAL EX. 4; COLL. TRIAL EX. 83.</p>\n<p>[61]  Specifically, <i>Waldo</i> states the following:\n</p>\n<p>As raised by many of the courts examining the issue of post-dated checks, there are serious ethical implications in such a practice, and the same is true herethat by accepting post-dated checks for dischargeable debts and not advising their clients that the debts were at least potentially dischargeable, Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Crawford created a conflict of interest with the Debtors under Tennessee's disciplinary rules. Rule 1.8(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct states, in material part, as follows:</p>\n<p>Rule 1.8 Conflict of Interest: Prohibited Transactions.</p>\n<p>(a) A lawyer shall not ... knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless:</p>\n<p>(1) The transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the client; and</p>\n<p>(2) The client is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel in the transaction; and</p>\n<p>(3) The client consents thereto in a writing signed by the client.</p>\n<p>TENN. SUP.CT. R. 8, Rule 1.8(a). As stated in the official comments to Rule 1.8, \"[a]s a general principle, all transactions between client and lawyer should be fair and reasonable to the client. In such transactions, a review by independent counsel on behalf of the client is advisable. Furthermore, a lawyer may not exploit information relating to the representation to the client's disadvantage.\" OFF. CMTS., TENN. SUP.CT. R. 8, Rule 1.8(a). Accordingly, \"[t]he existence of a conflict of interest does not require bad motive or intent. Most often it arises where the attorney's duty to one client conflicts with his/her duty to another or with the attorney's self-interest.\" <i>In re Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1838833\"><a href=\"/opinion/1838833/in-re-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 128 (Bankr.D.Colo.1996).</p>\n<p><i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 886.</p>\n<p>[62]  Moreover, because the fee arrangements in each of the Debtors' cases constitutes a pre-petition \"flat fee\" obligation, as the court has previously held, by depositing and/or cashing after discharge any paymentswhether by cash or post-dated checkreceived from or on behalf of any of the Debtors for satisfaction of that fee, Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs may have violated the discharge injunction of 11 U.S.C. § 524(a) (2006). <i>Waldo,</i> 417 B.R. at 890.</p>\n<p>[63]  Signatures on Affidavits, Declarations, Verified Documents, and Reaffirmation Agreements</p>\n<p>Except as provided in paragraph 3 immediately below, each affidavit, unsworn declaration under penalty of perjury, verified document, or reaffirmation agreement filed or submitted for filing must contain actual handwritten signatures. The \"/s/\" type of signature is not permitted on these types of documents. Registered Users filing such documents should scan and file them electronically after they have been signed (and, in the case of an affidavit, signed by the notary public and affixed with a notarial seal).</p>\n<p>E.D. Tenn. Admin. Procs. at ¶ III.A.2.</p>\n<p>[64]  Retention of Documents</p>\n<p>With respect to the documents described in paragraph 3 above, original documents bearing the debtor's actual signature must be maintained in paper form by the filing attorney until two years after the closing of the case. On request of the court, the attorney must provide such documents for review.</p>\n<p>E.D. Tenn. Admin. Procs. at ¶ III.A.5.65.</p>\n<p>[65]  \"When these rules require copies of a signed or verified paper, it shall suffice if the original is signed or verified and the copies are conformed to the original.\" FED. R. BANKR.P. 9011(f).</p>\n<p>[66]  The U.S. Trustee has requested, as additional sanctions, the following: the disallowance of fees in their entirety, termination of Clark &amp; Washington and Zachary Burroughs' status as Registered Users of the court's electronic case filing system, requiring all attorneys with Clark &amp; Washington to attend continuing legal education courses supplemental to those required by the State of Tennessee, and/or the suspension of Clark &amp; Washington and its attorneys to practice law in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.</p>\n<p>[67]  In 2009, Clark &amp; Washington's Knoxville office filed approximately 1,900 Chapter 7 cases in this court's Northern Division, and from January 1 through the date of this Memorandum, Mr. Burroughs and the Knoxville office of Clark &amp; Washington have filed approximately 1,000 Chapter 7 cases in the Northern Division.</p>\n<p>[68]  Based upon the court's independent review of compensation disclosure statements in other matters, the average approved hourly rate for para-professionals in this area is $75.00.</p>\n<p>[69]  The court wants to make it clear that this form of sanctions extends only to the cases presently before the court. Should the U.S. Trustee file disgorgement motions in other Chapter 7 cases filed by Clark &amp; Washington and Mr. Burroughs pending in the court's Northern Division to the date of this memorandum, the court would not, in the absence of egregious facts differing from those presently at issue, anticipate enhancing the sanctions beyond disgorgement.</p>\n\n</div>",
