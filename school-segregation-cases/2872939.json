For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.\n\n       In his complaint and amended complaint, Szemple alleged that sometime in 2003,\n\nhe filed a civil action against Correctional Medical Services, Inc. and others, alleging\n\ndeliberate indifference to his medical needs. On Friday, January 2, 2004, he reported to\n\nthe medical clinic at the New Jersey State Prison to have a prescription renewed. When\n\nSzemple requested the prescription, defendant Dr. Paul Talbot, who Szemple alleges was\n\naware of his 2003 lawsuit, replied, “Sue, sue, sue. You go back now, we’ll see about\n\nthis.” Szemple replied, “We’ll see about this.” Later that day, prison guards came to\n\nSzemple’s cell, handcuffed him, and escorted him to solitary confinement detention\n\nwhere he was subjected to a strip search and placed in a cell. Szemple alleges that he was\n\n“housed there continuously without any visits, recreation or access to a telephone until a\n\nhearing was afforded.”\n\n       The next day, a prison guard provided Szemple with a copy of a Form 529\n\n(Disciplinary Report), by which an unknown shift supervisor authorized his placement in\n\npre-hearing detention. The form also contained Dr. Talbot’s signature, and accused\n\nSzemple of threatening him in violation of N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1(a).005. The form\n\nrecounted Szemple’s statement, “We’ll see about this,” but did not include Talbot’s\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fpreceding statement. The form stated that Talbot felt threatened because of Szemple’s\n\nposturing and body language.\n\n       On Monday, January 5, 2004, Szemple had a hearing before a disciplinary hearing\n\nofficer, and was exonerated. He was released from solitary confinement and returned to\n\nthe general prison population.\n\n       Szemple’s complaint alleged that these actions violated his due process rights, and\n\nconstituted retaliation for his 2003 lawsuit. As relief, Szemple sought compensatory\n\ndamages, punitive damages, declaratory relief, and costs and fees. Szemple’s amended\n\ncomplaint added further counts alleging that defendants violated his due process rights\n\npursuant to certain New Jersey statutory provisions.\n\n       The District Court held that the claims against defendants Devon Brown, Roy\n\nHendricks, and Correctional Medical Services must be dismissed, as Szemple made no\n\nclaims that those defendants were personally involved. The Court dismissed the claims\n\nagainst all defendants in their official capacities, finding they were immune to liability\n\npursuant to the Eleventh Amendment. The Court also held that Szemple’s disciplinary\n\nconfinement did not rise to the level of an atypical or significant hardship that might\n\ncreate a protected liberty interest and therefore dismissed his due process claims. Finally,\n\nthe District Court recognized that a retaliation claim can survive even when the retaliatory\n\naction does not involve a liberty interest, but determined that Szemple’s statement to\n\nTalbot, along with his body language, was the motivating factor for the disciplinary\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fcharge against Szemple, rather than Szemple’s previously filed lawsuit. The District\n\nCourt concluded that Szemple’s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could\n\nbe granted, and dismissed the complaint.\n\n       Our review of a court’s sua sponte dismissal of a complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915(e) is plenary. Allah v. Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir. 2000). We accept\n\nthe factual allegations of the complaint as true and make all reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom. Id. For the reasons stated by the District Court, we agree that Szemple’s\n\nclaims against those defendants who were not alleged to be personally involved, as well\n\nas his claims for damages against state officials in their official capacities, must be\n\ndismissed. We further agree that Szemple’s allegations do not show that he was deprived\n\nof a liberty interest, and that his due process claims must be dismissed.\n\n       Turning to the retaliation claim, as the District Court properly noted, “A prisoner\n\nalleging retaliation must show (1) constitutionally protected conduct, (2) an adverse\n\naction by prison officials sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising\n\nhis constitutional rights, and (3) a causal link between the exercise of his constitutional\n\nrights and the adverse action taken against him.” Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (3d\n\nCir. 2003) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Szemple’s filing of his 2003\n\nlawsuit was an exercise of his First Amendment right of access to the courts. However,\n\nthe District Court found that Szemple did not meet the second and third prongs. First, the\n\nCourt found he had not suffered an adverse action, as he was found not guilty of the\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fcharge against him. Second, the Court found that Szemple had not established a causal\n\nlink. We agree that Szemple’s complaint failed to state a claim for retaliation.\n\n       As to the adverse action requirement, we have found that confinement in\n\nadministrative segregation can constitute adverse action. Allah, 229 F.3d at 225-26.\n\nHowever, Szemple’s confinement was limited to a few days, and his complaint does not\n\ndescribe any conditions of confinement that would deter a person of ordinary firmness\n\nfrom exercising his constitutional rights.\n\n       We further agree that Szemple failed to show a causal link between the lawsuit he\n\nhad filed a year before and Talbot’s initiation of disciplinary charges against him. Rather,\n\nTalbot indicated that he felt threatened by Szemple’s body language and his statement,\n\n“We’ll see about that.” Because Szemple failed to satisfy the elements of a retaliation\n\nclaim, the District Court properly dismissed the claim.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, and those stated by the District Court, we will affirm the\n\nDistrict Court’s judgment.1\n\n\n\n\nRENDELL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n\n\n       I respectfully dissent, because I cannot agree that dismissal of Szemple's pro se complaint\n\nwas proper.\n\n\n\n       1\n           The Clerk is hereby directed to file Appellant’s pro se Brief and Appendix.\n\n                                                5\n\f       Szemple alleged that the prison doctor retaliated against him, causing him to be placed in\n\nsolitary confinement, because he had sued the prison medical service. The majority rejects the\n\ncausal connection asserted at this early stage and impermissibly concludes that a different alleged\n\ncause was at work. This is not proper on a motion to dismiss.\n\n       Viewing all facts in the light most favorable to Szemple, his action should be permitted to\n\nproceed. See Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 65 (3d Cir. 1996) (stating that when reviewing the\n\nDistrict Court's grant of a motion to dismiss, “We must determine whether, under any reasonable\n\nreading of the pleadings, the plaintiffs may be entitled to relief, and we must accept as true the\n\nfactual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom”)\n\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n       This is particularly true in light of the liberal standard of review for a pro se complaint.\n\nSee Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 107 (1976) (recognizing that “a pro se complaint, however\n\ninartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by\n\nlawyers and can only be dismissed for failure to state a claim if it appears beyond doubt that the\n\nplaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief”)\n\n(internal quotations omitted).\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, I would vacate the dismissal of the retaliation claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f",

First, the\n\nCourt found he had not suffered an adverse action, as he was found not guilty of the\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fcharge against him. Second, the Court found that Szemple had not established a causal\n\nlink. We agree that Szemple’s complaint failed to state a claim for retaliation.\n\n       As to the adverse action requirement, we have found that confinement in\n\nadministrative segregation can constitute adverse action. Allah, 229 F.3d at 225-26.\n\nHowever, Szemple’s confinement was limited to a few days, and his complaint does not\n\ndescribe any conditions of confinement that would deter a person of ordinary firmness\n\nfrom exercising his constitutional rights.\n\n       We further agree that Szemple failed to show a causal link between the lawsuit he\n\nhad filed a year before and Talbot’s initiation of disciplinary charges against him. Rather,\n\nTalbot indicated that he felt threatened by Szemple’s body language and his statement,\n\n“We’ll see about that.” Because Szemple failed to satisfy the elements of a retaliation\n\nclaim, the District Court properly dismissed the claim.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, and those stated by the District Court, we will affirm the\n\nDistrict Court’s judgment.1\n\n\n\n\nRENDELL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n\n\n       I respectfully dissent, because I cannot agree that dismissal of Szemple's pro se complaint\n\nwas proper.\n\n\n\n       1\n           The Clerk is hereby directed to file Appellant’s pro se Brief and Appendix.\n\n                                                5\n\f       Szemple alleged that the prison doctor retaliated against him, causing him to be placed in\n\nsolitary confinement, because he had sued the prison medical service. The majority rejects the\n\ncausal connection asserted at this early stage and impermissibly concludes that a different alleged\n\ncause was at work. This is not proper on a motion to dismiss.\n\n       Viewing all facts in the light most favorable to Szemple, his action should be permitted to\n\nproceed. See Nami v. Fauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716767\"><a href=\"/opinion/716767/robert-nami-maurice-thompson-bart-fernandez-kenneth-thompson-kenneth-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (3d Cir. 1996) (stating that when reviewing the\n\nDistrict Court's grant of a motion to dismiss, “We must determine whether, under any reasonable\n\nreading of the pleadings, the plaintiffs may be entitled to relief, and we must accept as true the\n\nfactual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom”)\n\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n       This is particularly true in light of the liberal standard of review for a pro se complaint.\n\nSee Estelle v.
