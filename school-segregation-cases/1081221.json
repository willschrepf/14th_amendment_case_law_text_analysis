At the outset of its penultimate\n\nruling in this protracted litigation, the district court observed:\n\n\"This case may possibly be the concluding chapter in thirty years\n\nof litigation over the effort to desegregate the Boston Public\n\nSchools.\"     Boston's Children First v. Boston School Comm., 260 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 318, 319 (D. Mass. 2003).         That cautious prediction may be\n\naccurate.\n\n             Boston's Children First, a non-profit advocacy group, and\n\nparents of several white students sued the City of Boston, Boston\n\nMayor Thomas Menino, Boston Public Schools (BPS) Superintendent\n\nThomas   Payzant,    and   members   of    the    Boston    School   Committee\n\n(collectively, the defendants), claiming that BPS's now-defunct\n\nrace-conscious assignment system violated their children's rights\n\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1981 and 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (commonly known as Title VI),\n\nand Article 111 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Declaration\n\nof Rights.    Prompted at least in part by the lawsuit against them,\n\nthe   Boston     School    Committee,       at    the      recommendation    of\n\nSuperintendent Payzant, voted to remove the racial guidelines from\n\nthe assignment system on July 14, 1999.                 After BPS adopted a\n\nfacially    race-neutral    assignment     plan    in   November     1999,   the\n\nplaintiffs continued to press their suit, seeking declaratory\n\nrelief, several forms of injunctive relief, compensatory damages,\n\nand nominal damages. Over the course of four rulings, the district\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcourt denied all of plaintiffs' claims save one: an award of\n\nnominal damages of $1.00 each to the two students who would have\n\nbeen assigned to the school of their choice under the old system\n\nbut for their race.        Plaintiffs appeal.       Finding no error, we\n\naffirm the district court rulings in all respects.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            With four published district court decisions setting out\n\nthe factual background of this case in considerable detail, we\n\nlimit ourselves here to a recitation of the facts most pertinent to\n\nthe issues before us on appeal.            For greater detail, we refer\n\nreaders to Boston's Children First v. City of Boston, 62 F. Supp.\n\n2d 247 (D. Mass. 1999) (\"BCF I\"); Boston's Children First v. City\n\nof Boston, 98 F. Supp. 2d 111 (D. Mass. 2000) (\"BCF II\"); Boston's\n\nChildren First v. Boston School Comm., 183 F. Supp. 2d 382 (D.\n\nMass. 2002) (\"BCF III\"); and Boston's Children First v. Boston\n\nSchool Comm., 260 F. Supp. 2d 318 (D. Mass. 2003) (\"BCF IV\").\n\nAdditionally, the majority and dissenting opinions in Wessmann v.\n\nGittens, 160 F.3d 790 (1st Cir. 1998), provide a useful historical\n\noverview of      BPS's   desegregation-related     litigation   in   federal\n\ncourt.\n\n            In quick review, thirty years ago the Massachusetts\n\nfederal district court held that the City of Boston promoted and\n\nmaintained a racially segregated dual public school system in\n\nviolation   of    constitutionally    guaranteed    rights.     Morgan    v.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fHennigan, 379 F. Supp. 410, 482 (D. Mass. 1974).                 After twelve\n\nyears of supervision by the district court, the court returned\n\ncontrol over student assignments to BPS, declaring that BPS's\n\nstudent assignment system had achieved unitariness, Morgan v.\n\nNucci, 831 F.2d 313, 318 (1st Cir. 1987), \"i.e. a fully integrated,\n\nnon-segregated system.\"      Id. at 316.     At that point, BPS adopted an\n\nassignment system known as the Controlled Choice Student Assignment\n\nPlan, (the \"Old Plan\"), which went into effect for the 1989-90\n\nacademic year.\n\n                             A.   The Old Plan\n\n            BPS assigns students to schools at the transition grades\n\nduring students' public school careers, each of which corresponds\n\nto a student's advancement to a new type of school: kindergarten 1\n\n(programs for 4-year-olds), kindergarten 2 (programs for five-year-\n\nolds),    first   grade   (elementary     school),    sixth    grade    (middle\n\nschool),    and   ninth   grade   (high   school).      While    high   school\n\nassignments are made on a citywide basis, Boston is divided into\n\nthree    Attendance   Zones--the    North,    East,   and     West   Zones--for\n\npurposes of the elementary and middle school assignments at issue\n\nin this case.     These zones were drawn by the district court as part\n\nof its desegregation orders, and the lines largely hew to major\n\ntransportation routes to keep traditional neighborhoods intact as\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fmuch as possible.1    Students are eligible to attend any of the\n\nschools located in the Attendance Zone in which the students\n\nreside.\n\n          As part of the assignment process, students rank their\n\npreferences for the schools within their Attendance Zone, as well\n\nas for the few schools that accept students from any part of the\n\ncity without regard to Attendance Zone lines.2 Students whose\n\nsiblings attend a school receive a preference for that school\n\nduring the assignment process. Similarly, students who live within\n\nthe walk zone3 of a given school receive a preference for seats at\n\nthat school.    Finally, every student receives a randomly assigned\n\nlottery number, with the lower numbers being considered more\n\nadvantageous.\n\n          Under the Old Plan, BPS assigned students to schools\n\nusing the following critera: the student's rank preference for the\n\nschool; whether a sibling already attended the school; whether the\n\n\n\n     1\n      All of the plaintiffs here reside in the East Zone. While\nplaintiffs challenged the Attendance Zone concept earlier in this\nlitigation, they do not press any claim related to the Attendance\nZones on appeal.\n     2\n      Each Attendance Zone contains approximately 30 elementary\nschools; while students are free to rank all of those schools,\nalong with the citywide programs, in order of their preference,\nmost students actually rank only five to six schools.\n     3\n      For elementary schools, the walk zone includes the geocodes,\nor smaller geographic units within each Attendance Zone, within a\none-mile radius of the school. For middle schools, the walk zone\nradius increases to 1.5 miles.\n\n                                -6-\n\fstudent lived within the school's walk zone; whether the student\n\nhad already matriculated at the school on a temporary basis;4 and,\n\nas a tie-breaker, the student's random number, with a lower random\n\nnumber winning out over higher numbers.   Assignments under the Old\n\nPlan operated with one additional constraint--the \"ideal racial\n\npercentage\" for each grade's population, as calculated by the\n\nracial and ethnic composition of the student population in that\n\ngrade within each of the three Attendance Zones.     If admitting a\n\nstudent would cause a deviation of more than 15% from the \"ideal\n\nracial percentage,\" that student would not be admitted.      The Old\n\nPlan operated largely without change for ten years, from 1989\n\nthrough 1999.\n\n         B.     Boston's Exam School Assignment System and\n                Related \"Reverse Discrimination\" Lawsuits\n\n          In June 1999, the first four of what ultimately became\n\nten individual plaintiffs, along with Boston's Children First,5\n\n\n\n     4\n      This criterion applied when a school had more kindergarten\nseats than first grade seats.        Students with \"permanent\"\nkindergarten seats were assured placement in that school's first\ngrade, while students with \"temporary\" seats had to apply for a\nfirst grade seat. BCF III, 183 F. Supp. 2d at 386-87.\n     5\n      Plaintiffs-appellants in this case are now ten individual\nminor children, represented by their respective parent(s).\nBoston's Children First was the organizational plaintiff when the\ncase was initially filed. However, the district court found that\nBoston's Children First had no standing to bring suit. BCF III,\n183 F. Supp. 2d at 403.          This ruling was not appealed.\nAccordingly, Boston's Children First is not a party before this\ncourt on appeal, and we refer to the individual minors collectively\nas \"plaintiffs\" throughout the opinion.\n\n                                 -7-\n\ffiled this lawsuit, prompted in part by the successful \"reverse\n\ndiscrimination\" lawsuits brought by the families of two white\n\nchildren who were denied admission to their choice of one of BPS's\n\nthree competitive exam schools.         See McLaughlin v. Boston School\n\nComm., 938 F. Supp. 1001 (D. Mass. 1996); Wessmann v. Gittens, 160\n\nF.3d 790 (1st Cir. 1998).      These exam schools admit students using\n\na different system than that used by the other schools in the BPS\n\nsystem.    At the time Julia McLaughlin applied to Boston Latin\n\nSchool, admissions were based on a combination of an applicant's\n\ngrade point average and standardized test scores (collectively\n\ncalled    the   \"z-score\"),   subject     to   a   35%   minority   set-aside\n\npreviously imposed by the federal desegregation order and still in\n\neffect at that time.     After McLaughlin filed suit and obtained a\n\npreliminary     injunction    admitting    her     to    Boston   Latin,   BPS\n\nvoluntarily discontinued use of the 35% quota, admitted students\n\nsimilarly situated to McLaughlin, and commissioned a consulting\n\ncompany to devise a new admissions policy.\n\n            The replacement exam school admission policy eventually\n\nadopted by BPS defined the \"qualified applicant pool\" for each exam\n\nschool as the 50% of students with z-scores above the mean in any\n\ngiven year.      Then, BPS filled half of each exam school's seats\n\nbased on the students' expressed preferences for each school and\n\ntheir rank order z-scores.       The remainder of the seats were also\n\nallocated by students' school preferences and rank order z-scores,\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fsubject to mirroring the racial composition of the remaining\n\nqualified applicant pool not yet admitted.              Sarah Wessmann was\n\ndenied   admission   to   Boston    Latin    under    the    new   exam   school\n\nadmission system, sued, and ultimately prevailed on appeal.                      We\n\nfound the admission system unconstitutional because its use of\n\nracial   classifications    was     not    narrowly   tailored      to    meet    a\n\ncompelling state interest.        See Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 807-09.\n\n                            C.     The New Plan\n\n           Based in no small part on Superintendent Payzant's frank\n\nassessment to the School Committee that, in light of Wessmann and\n\nother reverse discrimination lawsuits, plaintiffs in this case\n\nwould almost certainly prevail in their challenge to the Old Plan,\n\nthe School Committee voted on July 14, 1999, to discontinue the use\n\nof the racial classifications in the Old Plan.              See BCF IV, 260 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 324 n.10.        At the time of this vote, the School\n\nCommittee also charged the Superintendent with developing a new\n\nstudent assignment plan that did not consider \"race as a factor in\n\nmaking student assignments\" and would also reflect \"other changes\n\nnecessary to maximize access to choice, to support diversity, and\n\npromote quality education for the children of the City of Boston.\"\n\nBCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d at 325.\n\n           On October 20 and November 3, 1999, the Superintendent\n\nrecommended that the Old Plan be further modified in two salient\n\nways: by reducing the percentage of available seats allocated for\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fstudents within a school's walk zone from 100% to 50%, and by\n\ntreating students who did not actually live within the walk zone of\n\nany school as though they had a walk-zone preference for their\n\nfirst   or   second    choice   school.     On   November   10,   the   School\n\nCommittee    adopted    the   Superintendent's     recommendations      to   the\n\nControlled Choice Student Assignment Plan with the modification\n\nthat students lacking a walk-zone school would be given a walk-zone\n\npreference for both their first and second choice schools.                   For\n\nconvenience, we refer to the modified Controlled Choice Student\n\nAssignment Plan as the \"New Plan.\"\n\n             Under the New Plan, which went into effect for the 2000-\n\n01 school year, students still rank their choice of schools and\n\nreceive random numbers. Students are sorted by their school choice\n\nand ordered by their random number, with the lowest numbers put at\n\nthe top of the list.          BPS then computes the number of available\n\nseats at each school and sets aside 50% of those seats for students\n\nwho live within the school's walk zone.           The seats at each school\n\nare then filled according to the following priorities: first\n\npriority to students within the school's walk zone and with a\n\nsibling already in attendance; second priority to students outside\n\nthe school's walk zone but with a sibling already in attendance;\n\nand third priority to students within the school's walk zone but\n\nwith no sibling already in attendance.           If there are more students\n\nin a priority tier than seats available, the seats will go to the\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fstudents with the better random numbers. As students are admitted,\n\nthe   system   updates   the   number   of   walk   zone   seats   that   are\n\navailable.     Once those walk zone seats are filled, a student's\n\nwalk-zone status drops out of consideration and students are\n\nassigned in accordance with the school preferences by the rank of\n\ntheir random number.6     Finally, the applications and assignments\n\nare done in rounds; if a student fails to meet the first round\n\napplication deadline, she can submit her preferences in the second\n\nround, and so on.\n\n                    D.   Course of Litigation Below\n\n             As previously mentioned, four plaintiffs and Boston's\n\nChildren First filed suit in federal district court on June 21,\n\n1999, claiming that the Old Plan violated the Equal Protection\n\nClause, which provides that no State shall \"deny to any person\n\nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\"; 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983, which collectively prohibit deprivations\n\nof constitutional rights under color of state law; Title VI, which\n\nprohibits institutions receiving federal funds from engaging in\n\nracial discrimination; and Article 111 of the Amendments to the\n\nMassachusetts    Declaration    of   Rights,   which   states   that   \"[n]o\n\nstudent shall be assigned to or denied admittance to a public\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      From what we can glean from the record, it appears that the\nassignment system virtually always accommodates the sibling\npriority.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fschool on the basis of race, color, national origin or creed.\"7\n\nPlaintiffs sought injunctive relief and class certification to\n\nrepresent all similarly situated white children.\n\n           On    July     14,    1999,    the   School   Committee      voted   to\n\ndiscontinue the use of race in assignments.               On August 10, 1999,\n\nthe district court denied plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief\n\nthat would have, inter alia, ordered BPS to cease using race or\n\nethnicity in any phase of the school assignment process and to re-\n\nopen the assignment process to students who attempted to transfer\n\nschools the previous year, as well as those entering kindergarten\n\nand first grade.        BCF I, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 262.\n\n           Some time after BCF I, six other plaintiff children\n\njoined   the    suit,    and    plaintiffs'     claims   for   relief   expanded\n\nconsiderably.       Plaintiffs      now    sought   at   least   six    forms   of\n\ninjunctive relief, including (1) admitting plaintiffs to their\n\nschools of choice, (2) enjoining defendants from the use of any\n\n\n     7\n      Because there is no dispute that the defendants are subject\nto Title VI, § 1981, and § 1983, all of plaintiffs' claims under\nthese provisions turn on the resolution of the equal protection\nclaim.     See General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v.\nPennsylvania,   458   U.S.   375,   389-390   (1982)    (purposeful\ndiscrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause also will\nviolate § 1981); Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 144 n.3 (1979) (§\n1983 \"is not itself a source of substantive rights, but a method\nfor vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred\"); Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 281 (2001) (Title VI proscribes only those\nracial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection\nClause or the Fifth Amendment). Accordingly, we, like the parties,\ndirect our analysis to the Equal Protection Clause arguments. We\ntreat the Article 111 claim separately in Part III.B.4.\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\frace-based practice in all aspects of school assignments and\n\ngovernance, (3) requiring all students in the BPS system to reapply\n\nunder the terms of the New Plan, (4) dismantling the Attendance\n\nZones, (5) granting Boston's Children First access to BPS records\n\nto monitor compliance, and (6) retaining jurisdiction in federal\n\ncourt for three years to monitor compliance.         Plaintiffs also\n\nsought declaratory relief stating that the New Plan violated their\n\nrights under the relevant federal and state laws, nominal damages\n\nfor all plaintiffs, and compensatory damages for five plaintiffs.8\n\nOn October 29, BPS moved to dismiss plaintiffs' claims, arguing\n\nthat the suit was moot in light of its voluntary discontinuance of\n\nthe Old Plan.\n\n          On May 19, 2000, the BCF II court ruled that all of these\n\nclaims survived defendants’ motion to dismiss, with one exception.\n\nFinding that five \"of the plaintiffs did not seek assignments in\n\nthe 1999-2000 school year and have not indicated any present\n\nintention to seek an assignment in the 2000-01 school year,\" the\n\ndistrict court held that \"injunctive relief is unnecessary to\n\nredress the injuries of these [five] plaintiffs as they have not\n\nindicated that they will even participate in the future school\n\nassignment plan.\"   BCF II, 98 F. Supp. 2d at 117.   Accordingly, the\n\ncourt granted defendants' motion to dismiss in so far as it related\n\n\n     8\n      The plaintiffs seeking compensatory damages were Jamie Lee\nHiggins, John O'Toole, Andrew Sharaffa, and Sean and Thomas\nStoddard.\n\n                                -13-\n\fto the injunctive relief of those five plaintiffs,9 and otherwise\n\ndenied the motion.    Id.\n\n           In BCF III, the court disposed of additional claims.\n\nFirst, the court dismissed as moot the remaining five plaintiffs'\n\nrequest for injunctive relief admitting them to their school of\n\nchoice because three plaintiffs (Sharaffa, O'Toole, and Feeney)\n\nleft the BPS system prior to the 2001 admissions season, and the\n\nfinal two plaintiffs (Higgins and Thomas Stoddard) chose to remain\n\nat their current schools.         BCF III, 183 F. Supp. 2d at 395.\n\nSecond, the court rejected plaintiffs' claims that the three\n\nAttendance Zones were \"racially gerrymandered,\" explaining that\n\n\"[b]ecause the zones today, whatever role race may have played in\n\ntheir creation, serve administrative, rather than racial balancing\n\npurposes, I conclude that no viable 'case or controversy' exists\n\nregarding their current configuration.\"         Id. at 397-99.      This\n\nholding   disposed   of   both   the   injunctive   request   related   to\n\ndismantling the Attendance Zones and the declaratory relief request\n\nto the extent that it rested on the allegedly racial purpose of the\n\nAttendance Zones.    Third, the court denied plaintiffs' request for\n\nan injunction requiring every student in the BPS system to reapply\n\nunder the New Plan, explaining that\n\n           even if a showing could be made that one or\n           more of the plaintiffs might derive an\n\n\n     9\n      These five plaintiffs are Michael Gattozzi, Kathleen McCoy,\nNicholas Anderson, Kayleigh Barry-Meltzer, and Sean Stoddard.\n\n                                  -14-\n\f            advantage from a system-wide reprocessing of\n            all student assignments, any benefit conferred\n            would   be   outweighed  by   the   consequent\n            demoralization of a school system that has yet\n            to fully absorb the effects of a quarter-\n            century effort to bring itself into compliance\n            with court-ordered desegregation.\n\nId. at 401.    Fourth, the court held that Boston's Children First\n\nlacked    standing   as   an   organizational      plaintiff   to   press   the\n\nlawsuit.    Id. at 403.    The BCF III court reserved all of the other\n\nclaims in the suit pending further discovery, briefing, and trial.\n\nId.\n\n            Following a bench trial on the merits, the district court\n\nissued a ruling in BCF IV on April 23, 2003.                The BCF IV court\n\nfound that (1) the New Plan, with its change in the walk zone\n\npreference from 100% to 50% of seats, was facially race-neutral,\n\n(2) there was no evidence that the policy was applied in a\n\ndiscriminatory manner, and (3) plaintiffs did not show that the\n\npolicy was adopted with a discriminatory intention and applied in\n\na way that had a discriminatory effect.          BCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n331-32.    Accordingly, the district court declined to apply strict\n\nscrutiny to the New Plan.          Id. at 333.   Instead, it evaluated the\n\nNew Plan under rational basis review and found that it \"satisf[ied]\n\nthe   reasonableness      test.\"      Id.    The    court   also    held    that\n\nplaintiffs' \"[m]ere skepticism . . . about the defendants' future\n\nintentions[] cannot justify\" an injunction prohibiting the school\n\nsystem from using race as a factor in the assignment system in the\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\ffuture. In consequence, the court entered judgment for defendants,\n\nid. at 334, and noted that it would address the bifurcated claims\n\nfor nominal damages separately. Id. at n.28.\n\n            On May 27, 2003, the court issued a short memorandum and\n\norder awarding nominal damages of $1.00 each to Feeney and McCoy\n\nbecause, as BPS admitted, those plaintiffs \"were denied seat\n\nassignments at their preferred schools because of their race\" under\n\nthe Old Plan.    Boston's Children First v. Boston School Comm., No.\n\n99-11330-RGS (D. Mass. May 27, 2003) (unpublished) (\"BCF V\").                The\n\ncourt also held that \"[a]s the remaining plaintiffs can make no\n\nshowing of a deprivation under Texas v. Lesage, 528 U.S. 18, 21\n\n(1999) (per curiam), no damages, nominal or otherwise, may be\n\nawarded.\"    BCF V, at 1.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            On this factually rich and comprehensively litigated\n\nbackground, we are now presented with plaintiffs' appeal from a\n\nvariety of adverse rulings. Although we find some confusion in the\n\nrecord and the briefs over both the exact nature of the relief\n\nsought on appeal and whether certain claims for injunctive relief\n\nsought by    plaintiffs     were   dismissed   for   mootness    or   lack    of\n\nstanding,   or   instead    resolved   on   the   merits,   we    ultimately\n\nunderstand that plaintiffs seek three forms of relief on appeal.\n\nFirst, plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the New Plan is\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\funconstitutional.10           Second,      plaintiffs      seek     an   injunction\n\nprohibiting BPS from using race in any way in a modified school\n\nassignment system.        Third, plaintiffs request nominal damages for\n\nthe eight plaintiffs to whom nominal damages were previously\n\ndenied.11    After discussing the standards of review which guide our\n\nanalysis    of     the   issues,     we   will   address    these    three   claims\n\nseriatim.\n\n                                          III.\n\n                             A.    Standards of Review\n\n             \"We accord deferential review to specific findings of\n\nfact emanating from a bench trial.\"                Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 795\n\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)).            However, when the issues on appeal\n\n\"raise[] either questions of law or questions about how the law\n\napplies to discerned facts,\" such as whether the proffered evidence\n\nestablishes a discriminatory purpose or a disproportionate racial\n\nimpact,     \"our    review    is    essentially    plenary.\"         Id.   at   795.\n\n\n\n     10\n      Although plaintiffs do not explicitly request reversal of the\ndistrict court's denial of a declaratory judgment holding the New\nPlan unconstitutional, they claim that they have standing to seek\nsuch a declaratory judgment.     Further, they argue at length in\ntheir briefs that the New Plan is unconstitutional. We cannot read\nthese arguments as anything other than a request that the New Plan\nbe declared unconstitutional.\n     11\n      According to their brief, plaintiffs explicitly \"no longer\nseek relief in the form of individual reassignments to their\nschools of choice.\" Furthermore, plaintiffs apparently no longer\nseek compensatory damages or any of the myriad forms of injunctive\nrelief once requested, save the injunction prohibiting the use of\nrace in future school assignment systems.\n\n                                          -17-\n\fSimilarly, we review de novo the district court's other legal\n\nconclusions, Cohen v. Brown Univ.,101 F.3d 155, 192 (1st Cir.\n\n1996), including the level of scrutiny it applied when evaluating\n\nthe constitutionality of the New Plan and, in the context of\n\ndenying eight plaintiffs nominal damages, its interpretation of\n\nTexas v. Lesage, 528 U.S. 18 (1999) (per curiam).   Dispositions of\n\na request for injunctive relief are typically \"review[ed] only to\n\nensure that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ngranting, or failing to grant, such relief,\" Caroline T. v. Hudson\n\nSchool Dist., 915 F.2d 752, 754 (1st Cir. 1990), although related\n\nlegal determinations, such as mootness, are reviewed under the\n\nusual de novo review afforded to all conclusions of law.       See\n\nCotter v. City of Boston, 323 F.3d 160, 166 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            B.   The Constitutionality of the New Plan\n\n          A key question in analyzing the constitutionality of the\n\nNew Plan is whether strict scrutiny or rational basis review\n\napplies. Plaintiffs present several arguments that strict scrutiny\n\napplies, including that the unconstitutionality of the Old Plan12\n\nrequires a presumption that the New Plan is unconstitutional and\n\n\n\n     12\n      Although the district court never explicitly described the\nOld Plan as unconstitutional, it awarded nominal damages to two\nplaintiffs who had been denied school assignments under the Old\nPlan because of their race; and nominal damages in this context\nrequire a constitutional violation. Since the defendants neither\nappealed from the award nor sought to defend the constitutionality\nof the Old Plan, we accept for purposes of our analysis the\ncolorable premise that the Old Plan was unconstitutional.\n\n                               -18-\n\fthat the defendants' stated goal of diversity requires a finding\n\nthat the New Plan is unconstitutional.                Even if those arguments\n\nfail, plaintiffs contend, the New Plan has a discriminatory effect\n\nfrom which a discriminatory intent can be inferred.\n\n                     1.   Adoption of the New Plan\n\n              When designing and choosing among methods for assigning\n\nstudents to schools, school boards seek to promote certain values\n\nand   policies,     and   they     operate    within     certain   historical,\n\npolitical, financial, and legal constraints.               Defendants in this\n\ncase are no exception.      As they considered the adoption of the New\n\nPlan in 1999, they saw a system burdened with a significant\n\ninequity in the number of walk zone schools available to students\n\nin different parts of the city.          For example, while about 30% of\n\nelementary school students had only one to three walk zone choices,\n\napproximately 37% had six to ten.            In fact, when the New Plan was\n\nadopted in November 1999, 1772 students were not within the walk\n\nzone of any school.       Furthermore, at the neighborhood level, some\n\nareas of the city had an excess capacity of school seats compared\n\nto the number of school-age children, while other areas faced\n\nsignificant shortages.          For example, Roxbury and South Dorchester\n\nboth faced shortages of around 2500 seats, while Jamaica Plain and\n\nAllston/Brighton collectively had excess capacity of around 1600\n\nseats. Additionally, some schools in significant demand were over-\n\nchosen   by    parents    and    students,    while    others   lacked   enough\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fapplicants to fill the available seats.               In the East Zone, where\n\nplaintiffs reside, Everett Elementary had 7.3 applicants for each\n\navailable seat for the 2002-03 academic year, while Lee Elementary\n\nhad just 0.6 applicants for each available seat.\n\n           The     substantial          disparities     among        the   Boston\n\nneighborhoods regarding school quality and capacity, numbers of\n\nresident   students,      and    walk     zone   choices      were    significant\n\nconsiderations in the adoption of the New Plan and its reduction of\n\nthe walk zone preference to 50% of the seats.                 Additionally, BPS\n\ncompiled statistics showing that of the parents and students\n\nranking their school choices, approximately 50% chose a walk zone\n\nschool as their first choice, while the other 50% chose as their\n\nfirst choice a school whose walk zone did not include the student.\n\n           BPS   also    had     been    concerned    about    the    potentially\n\nresegregative impact of removing the racial guidelines of the Old\n\nPlan and simultaneously leaving the 100% walk zone preference in\n\nplace.   Apparently, though, BPS's analysis allayed those concerns,\n\nshowing that there would be little immediate resegregative effect\n\nof   removing    the    racial    guidelines.         Superintendent       Payzant\n\nexplained to the Massachusetts Board of Education that when the\n\nSchool Committee was considering changes to the Old Plan, BPS\n\n           did some simulations to see what the impact\n           would be as a result of removing race from the\n           plan, and based on the data we had to work\n           with at the time, . . . the result of removing\n           race was really very, very small. In fact, we\n           found out we only had three additional schools\n\n                                        -20-\n\f           that would not meet the racial guidelines in\n           one or more grades . . . .\n\nAlthough   the    immediate   racial   impact   of    removing      the   racial\n\nguidelines would be \"very small,\" BPS was still concerned about the\n\nimpact on access and choice that would flow from a 100% walk zone\n\npreference.      Accordingly, BPS simulated the results of leaving the\n\nwalk zone preference at 100%, reducing it to 75%, and reducing it\n\nto 50%.    Ultimately, Superintendent Payzant recommended the 50%\n\nreduction in an October 20, 1999, memo to the School Committee.\n\n           RATIONALE\n           One hundred percent walk zone preference in a\n           controlled    choice   plan   without    racial\n           guidelines could result in all available seats\n           being assigned to students within the walk\n           zone. The result would limit choice and access\n           for all students, including those who have no\n           walk zone or live in walk zones where there are\n           insufficient seats to serve the students\n           residing in the walk zone. . . .\n\n           Until more neighborhoods without schools or\n           with insufficient numbers of schools have [more\n           schools], [a] one hundred percent walk zone\n           preference would limit choice and access for\n           too many families to the schools they want\n           their children to attend. On the other hand,\n           the policy also should and does recognize the\n           interests of families who want to choose a walk\n           zone school.\n\n\nSuperintendent Payzant concluded the memo by stating that a 50%\n\nwalk zone preference \"provides a fair balance and enables the\n\nSchool Committee      to   establish   a   policy    which   will    result   in\n\nprogress in meeting the goal[s] of excellence, equity and diversity\n\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fthrough access and educational opportunity throughout the Boston\n\nPublic Schools.\"\n\n            The evidence supports the conclusion that the racial\n\nimpact of removing the racial guidelines was not significant, and\n\nthe School Committee adopted the 50% reduction in walk-zone seats\n\nprimarily because they were concerned about limited choice and\n\nequity for students with an insufficient number of walk-zone\n\nschools.       Additionally, Superintendent Payzant and the School\n\nCommittee concluded that the 50% reduction was consistent with\n\nprogress towards BPS's existing goals of excellence, equity, and\n\ndiversity.\n\n                      2.     Applicability of Strict Scrutiny Review\n\n            \"The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official conduct\n\ndiscriminating on the basis of race.\"             Washington v. Davis, 426\n\nU.S.    229,    239   (1976).       Accordingly,    \"[p]roof   of   racially\n\ndiscriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause.\"             Village of Arlington Heights v.\n\nMetropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265 (1977).                When\n\nthe    government     uses    explicit   racial   classifications   for   the\n\ndistribution of benefits, discriminatory intent is presumed, and\n\nthose policies are always subjected to strict scrutiny. See, e.g.,\n\nPers. Adm'r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272 (1979) (\"A racial\n\nclassification,        regardless        of   purported   motivation,      is\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fpresumptively invalid and can be upheld only upon an extraordinary\n\njustification.\"); Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 326 (2003)\n\n(\"[A]ll   racial    classifications      imposed      by    government     must   be\n\nanalyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\") (internal\n\nquotations and citation omitted). \"We apply strict scrutiny to all\n\nracial classifications to ''smoke out' illegitimate uses of race by\n\nassuring that [government] is pursuing a goal important enough to\n\nwarrant use of a highly suspect tool.'\"              Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326\n\n(quoting Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989)\n\n(plurality opinion).)         The term racial classification \"normally\n\nrefers to a governmental standard, preferentially favorable to one\n\nrace or another, for the distribution of benefits.\"               Raso v. Lago,\n\n135 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            Here,   though,    the    New     Plan   does   not   employ    racial\n\nclassifications.     Indeed, plaintiffs concede, as they must, that\n\nthe New Plan is facially race-neutral.               In contrast, then, to the\n\nautomatic    application      of     strict     scrutiny     to   overt     racial\n\nclassifications, \"when facially neutral legislation is subjected to\n\nequal protection attack, an inquiry into intent is necessary to\n\ndetermine whether the legislation in some sense was designed to\n\naccord disparate treatment on the basis of racial considerations.\"\n\nWashington v. Seattle School Dist., 458 U.S. 457, 484-85 (1982)\n\n(emphasis added).       Although plaintiffs may also invoke strict\n\nscrutiny review by showing that the facially neutral policy is\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fapplied in a discriminatory manner, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S.\n\n356, 373-74 (1886), plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence that the\n\nNew Plan is applied in a discriminatory manner, nor do we see any\n\nin the record.13\n\n          In   reviewing   a   uniformly   applied   facially   neutral\n\nstatute, \"[d]etermining whether invidious discriminatory purpose\n\nwas a motivating factor [in its adoption] demands a sensitive\n\ninquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as\n\nmay be available.\"    Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266.          The\n\nSupreme Court nonexhaustively enumerated several factors relevant\n\nto the inquiry: the degree of disproportionate racial effect, if\n\nany, of the policy; the justification, or lack thereof, for any\n\ndisproportionate racial effect that may exist; and the legislative\n\nor administrative historical background of the decision.        Id. at\n\n266-68.   We will evaluate plaintiffs' various theories supporting\n\nstrict scrutiny review through the lens provided by Arlington\n\n\n     13\n      As the BCF IV court noted, only one school deviates from the\n50% walk zone preference: the new K-8 Orchard Gardens School,\nlocated in the predominately minority neighborhood of Roxbury\nCrossing, uses a 75% walk zone preference. BCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d\nat 331.     Although the district court called this deviation\n\"troubling,\" id. at n.24, it noted that the Orchard Gardens School\nis located in an area that has traditionally had too few schools to\nserve the resident student population. Id. at 331. Also, Orchard\nGardens School is one of only three K-8 pilot schools, which are\nsubject to fewer restrictions than the vast majority of non-pilot\nschools in the BPS system, and one of only two schools with a walk\nzone that crosses Attendance Zone lines.       More to the point,\nplaintiffs do not argue on appeal that the Orchard Gardens School\nwalk zone preference is proof of BPS applying the facially neutral\nwalk zone policy in a discriminatory manner.\n\n                                 -24-\n\fHeights, although we take the factors in a different order to\n\nbetter track plaintiffs' arguments.\n\n                   a.   Historical background: alleged\n                        presumption of discriminatory intent\n\n           Plaintiffs    claim   that   because   the   Old   Plan   was\n\nunconstitutional, and the New Plan perpetuates the Old Plan's\n\neffects in violation of defendants' alleged \"duty to eliminate\n\ntheir duel [sic] assignment system\" of the Old Plan, we should\n\ninfer that the New Plan was adopted with a discriminatory intent.\n\nTo support this contention, plaintiffs quote two bedrock Supreme\n\nCourt desegregation cases from the 1970s: Dayton Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nBrinkman, 443 U.S. 526 (1979) (Dayton II); and Keyes v. School\n\nDist., 413 U.S. 189 (1973).      The very language plaintiffs quote\n\nfrom these cases, as well as their significantly different facts,\n\ndemonstrate the inaptness of these cases.\n\n           As plaintiffs point out, the Keyes Court held that \"there\n\nis   a   high   probability   that   where   school   authorities    have\n\neffectuated an intentionally segregative policy in a meaningful\n\nportion of the school system, similar impermissible considerations\n\nhave motivated their actions in other areas of the system.\" Keyes,\n\n413 U.S. at 208.     Plaintiffs quote Dayton II for the proposition\n\nthat such a system is \"under a continuing duty to eradicate the\n\neffects of that system, and [] the systemwide nature of the\n\nviolation furnished prima facie proof that current segregation in\n\nthe [] schools was caused at least in part by prior intentionally\n\n                                 -25-\n\fsegregative official acts.\"     Dayton II, 443 U.S. at 536 (internal\n\ncitation omitted).\n\n          Keyes and Dayton II were ongoing school desegregation\n\ncases that involved purposeful discrimination by school systems\n\nattempting to avoid their affirmative obligation to undo systemic\n\ndiscrimination under Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 495\n\n(1954) (Brown I) (holding that the concept of \"separate but equal\"\n\nhas no place in public education) and Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 349\n\nU.S. 294, 301 (1955) (Brown II) (ordering an end to segregated\n\npublic education \"with all deliberate speed.\").          That was the\n\nstatus of the Boston school desegregation case at the time of the\n\ninitial liability findings in 1974 and the remedial plan in 1976.\n\nSee   Morgan   v.   Kerrigan,   509   F.2d   580,   593-94   (1st   Cir.\n\n1974)(relying in part on Keyes in upholding liability); Morgan v.\n\nKerrigan, 530 F.2d 401, 425 (1st Cir. 1976)(relying in part on\n\nKeyes in upholding the remedial plan).\n\n          This case arises in a completely different context.\n\nAfter going through school desegregation, Boston was found in 1987\n\nto have achieved a unitary school assignment system.         See Morgan,\n\n831 F.2d at 318.    The defendants here acted not with the intent to\n\nmaintain a system of de jure segregation, but with the purpose of\n\nmaintaining the post-segregation unitary system.       Indeed, the Old\n\nPlan, toward this end, incorporated aspects of the Boston school\n\n\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fdesegregation        plan   that   were     constitutionally    compelled.14\n\nAdditionally, when the school committee adopted the Old Plan for\n\nthe 1989 school year, the questionable constitutionality of such\n\nrace-conscious efforts to minimize the tendency to resegregate was\n\nfar from clear.\n\n            In essence, plaintiffs would like to limit the relevant\n\nhistory of this case to the period following the adoption of the\n\nOld Plan.      However, there is also a relevant history of de jure\n\ndiscrimination against minorities that predates 1989, as the long\n\nhistory of the BPS desegregation litigation shows. In consequence,\n\nthe present-day Boston school system really faces two \"legacies\"--\n\nthe   system    it    administered    for    decades   that    intentionally\n\n\n      14\n      At the time that the BPS student assignment system was\ndeclared unitary, it included the following court-ordered racial\nguidelines:\n\n            The enrollment guidelines are based upon the\n            racial/ethnic composition of the public school\n            population within each community district and\n            at each grade level: elementary, middle, and\n            high school. . . . [A]ssignment totals at a\n            particular school may diverge from the\n            community district standard within a range\n            established by adding and subtracting 25% from\n            each racial/ethnic group's proportion . . . .\n            Thus, for example, if 48% of the elementary\n            school students residing in a subdistrict\n            consisted of a particular racial/ethnic group,\n            25% of 48, i.e., 12, would be added and\n            subtracted to result in an allowable range\n            from 36% to 60% for the assignment of these\n            students to each elementary school in the\n            community district.\n\nMorgan v. Nucci, 620 F. Supp. 214, 221 (D. Mass. 1985).\n\n                                     -27-\n\fdiscriminated    against     minorities        to    maintain     an   unequal     and\n\nsegregated system, and the system it administered for ten years\n\nthat subjected seat assignments to racial guidelines to maintain\n\nthe racial integration achieved during the intervening twelve years\n\nof court-ordered desegregation.\n\n           There   is   no       gainsaying    that    the   system       still   must\n\nconfront the fallout from its days of over-serving what were\n\ntraditionally   white   communities         and     under-serving          what   were\n\ntraditionally minority, then mostly black, communities. As the BCF\n\nIV court stated: \"Any assignment plan in the Boston School system\n\nis, and will be for the foreseeable future, constrained by the\n\nmismatch between school capacity and neighborhood demand, due in\n\npart to demographic shifts, and in part to the dual system's legacy\n\nof over-serving what were historically white neighborhoods.\"                       BCF\n\nIV, 260 F. Supp. 2d at 325.\n\n           We decline to adopt plaintiffs' circumscribed view of\n\nhistory.    Likewise,       we    decline     to    find   that    plaintiffs     have\n\nestablished a prima facie case of discriminatory intent in the\n\nadoption   of   the   New    Plan     simply       because   the    Old    Plan    was\n\nconstitutionally unsound.          Over forty years ago, the Supreme Court\n\nadvised federal courts that context matters:\n\n           [I]n   dealing    with   claims  under   broad\n           provisions of the Constitution, which derive\n           content   by   an   interpretive  process   of\n           inclusion and exclusion, it is imperative that\n           generalizations, based on and qualified by the\n           concrete situations that gave rise to them,\n\n                                       -28-\n\f          must not be applied out of context                   in\n          disregard of variant controlling facts.\n\nGomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 343-44 (1960) (evaluating the\n\nvalidity of a redistricting plan under, inter alia, the Equal\n\nProtection Clause).     Here, BPS voluntarily discontinued use of the\n\nOld Plan once it concluded that the plan was constitutionally\n\nsuspect--in fact, within eight months of our decision in Wessmann--\n\nand replaced it with a racially neutral assignment system that was\n\ndesigned to maximize, not minimize, the equitable distribution of\n\nseats in the public schools.\n\n             We recognize that \"[b]enign intentions do not immunize\n\ngovernment action,\" Raso, 135 F.3d at 16, and we do not suggest\n\notherwise.     There is no doubt that governmental policies that\n\nemploy racial classifications for the distribution of benefits, or\n\notherwise evince racial discrimination, should be subjected to\n\nstrict scrutiny review.      If plaintiffs could make such a showing,\n\nwe would not hesitate to apply strict scrutiny to the New Plan.\n\nHowever, by declining to extend the reach of Keyes, Dayton II, and\n\nsimilar cases     beyond   their   facts   to   create   a   presumption   of\n\nracially discriminatory purpose in the adoption of the New Plan, we\n\nsimply refuse to conflate vastly dissimilar cases.\n\n                   b.   Historical background: inclusion of\n                        diversity as a goal of the New Plan\n\n          Plaintiffs also argue that the New Plan was adopted for\n\nracially discriminatory reasons and should be subject to strict\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fscrutiny because Superintendent Payzant and the Boston School\n\nCommittee identified diversity as one of the several goals of the\n\nstudent assignment system.        Plaintiffs equate this commitment to\n\nracial    diversity   with   an   illegitimate   commitment   to   racial\n\nbalancing.      See   Wessmann,     160   F.3d   at   800   (noting   the\n\n\"Constitution's general prohibition against racial balancing\"). To\n\nprove their point, plaintiffs cite the testimony of Superintendent\n\nPayzant elicited on cross-examination during this litigation:\n\n           Q. So this 50% walk-to plan actually preserved\n           the racial balance gained by the Old Plan;\n           isn't that correct?\n\n           A. Right, which is precisely why I didn't want\n           to keep 100% walk-zone preference in the New\n           Plan after racial guidelines were withdrawn.\n\nIn addition, plaintiffs cite communications from defendants trying\n\nto convince the Racial Imbalance Advisory Council (RIAC)15 and the\n\nBoard of Education that after the adoption of the New Plan, BPS\n\nshould still qualify for funds under the Racial Imbalance Law,\n\nM.G.L. c. 71, § 37C, et seq. (RIL).16      Essentially, Superintendent\n\n\n     15\n      This council advises the Massachusetts Commissioner of\nEducation and the Massachusetts Board of Education on issues\nrelated to the development and maintenance of school desegregation\nand integration in public schools within the Commonwealth. Much of\nthat communication and testimony related to BPS's eligibility for\nfunding under the Racial Imbalance Law. See footnote 16, infra.\n     16\n      The RIL, inspired by Title VI and adopted in 1965, states a\npolicy \"to encourage all school committees to adopt as educational\nobjectives the promotion of racial balance and the correction of\nexisting racial imbalance in the public schools.\" M.G.L. c. 71, §\n37C. To be eligible for funds under the RIL, school boards must\nprovide the State Board of Education with statistics demonstrating\n\n                                   -30-\n\fPayzant argued that (1) BPS qualified for funds under the Old Plan,\n\n(2) the New Plan maintained approximately the same racial balance\n\nwithin the schools as the Old Plan, so (3) BPS should still qualify\n\nfor RIL funds, even though the New Plan lacked the explicit racial\n\nguidelines of the Old Plan.\n\n             Plaintiffs' reliance on selected excerpts ignores the\n\ntotality of the evidence.        As already noted, BPS's statistical\n\nanalyses showed that, even with the elimination of the racial\n\nguidelines and a 100% walk zone preference in place, there was only\n\na   \"very,   very   small\"   racial    result.   Superintendent   Payzant\n\ntestified at trial that BPS compared the results of a 100% walk\n\nzone preference applied both with and without the use of the racial\n\nguidelines called for in the Old Plan\n\n             to let the data speak for themselves and show\n             to the Commissioner, and ultimately the State\n             Board of Education, that the impact of the\n             change in the student assignment plan by\n             removing racial guidelines but keeping the\n             other elements of the controlled choice would\n             enable us to come very close to the same\n             circumstances that we had that qualified us\n             for . . . meeting the standards of the Racial\n             Imbalance Law before the policy was changed.\n\n\n\n\ntheir compliance with the racial balancing requirements of the RIL.\nId. § 37D. BPS last received RIL funds in November 2001 because\nthe Massachusetts legislature defunded the program for 2002. The\nprogram remains unfunded, and its validity is currently being\nchallenged in the federal courts. Comfort ex rel. Neumyer v. Lynn\nSchool Comm., 283 F. Supp. 2d 328 (D. Mass. 2003) appeal docketed,\nNo. 03-2415 (1st Cir. Oct. 17, 2003).\n\n                                      -31-\n\f           The data are indeed telling. According to Superintendent\n\nPayzant's testimony to the Board of Education, when BPS simulated\n\nthe first-round transition grade assignments for the 1999-2000 year\n\nusing actual parent choices but eliminating only the use of the\n\nracial guidelines, it found that just three additional schools\n\nwould have one or more transitional grades falling outside the\n\nracial guidelines.    Using the parental choice data to analyze the\n\neffect on individual student placements without the use of the\n\nracial guidelines revealed that only 938 out of 13,057 (or seven\n\npercent) of students would have been assigned to different schools.\n\nAbout   fifty-three   percent    of   those      938    individual   changed\n\nassignments would have resulted in the student being assigned to a\n\nschool which she had ranked higher, and, correspondingly, forty-\n\nseven percent would have been assigned to a school which she had\n\nranked lower.   Whites, Asians, and Hispanics fared slightly better\n\nas groups, while blacks and Native Americans fared slightly worse.\n\n           In sum, BPS's analyses showed that, even after removing\n\nthe racial guidelines of the Old Plan, the BPS school assignment\n\nsystem did not need further modification to maintain the \"racial\n\nbalance\"   required   to   be   eligible   for    RIL    funds.      Although\n\ndefendants were pressured by RIAC to continue explicit racial\n\nbalancing, they refused to comply, despite the substantial RIL\n\nfunds at stake.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\f           However, the Superintendent and the School Committee were\n\nalso concerned about equity of choice and access across the system,\n\nparticularly   for   students     who     lived   in      neighborhoods    with\n\ninadequate capacity or underperforming schools.              In his July 14,\n\n1999 memo to the School Committee, Superintendent Payzant commented\n\nthat \"it is important to note that this is not an issue of\n\nreturning to neighborhood schools. That can happen in an equitable\n\nway only when new quality schools are built in neighborhoods that\n\nnow have an insufficient number of schools to serve resident school\n\nage children . . . .\"        This concern is further reflected in the\n\nsummary description of the New Plan provided to the Commissioner of\n\nEducation as part of BPS's RIL compliance presentation.                    That\n\ndocument stated that the Superintendent and the School Committee\n\n           are confident that the [New Plan] continues to\n           ensure both choice and access beyond a\n           student's particular neighborhood in order to\n           preserve racial and ethnic diversity and\n           reduce the likelihood of racial isolation\n           within its schools.    In addition, the [New\n           Plan] retains all of the educational benefits\n           of the original Controlled Choice Student\n           Assignment Plan, including the promotion of\n           school improvement, continuity and stability\n           of placement, and equitable distribution of\n           resources    and    educational    opportunity\n           district-wide.\n\nThe defendants' public confidence that the New Plan preserved\n\nracial   diversity   while    advancing    the    other    values   that   they\n\nidentified was not an admission that the New Plan was a suspect\n\n\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fdevice to achieve the numerically precise racial balancing of the\n\nOld Plan.\n\n            Contrary to plaintiffs' arguments, the mere invocation of\n\nracial diversity as a goal is insufficient to subject the New Plan\n\nto strict scrutiny.      In those cases where the Supreme Court\n\ninquired whether diversity is a compelling state interest and\n\nwhether the program at issue could survive strict scrutiny, the\n\nprograms were all subjected to strict scrutiny because they used\n\nexplicit racial classifications to achieve the goal of diversity.17\n\nNone of these cases, nor any other case to which our attention has\n\nbeen drawn, has subjected a governmental program to strict scrutiny\n\nsimply because the state mentioned diversity as a goal.       As the\n\ndistrict court succinctly put it: \"Motive, in other words, is not\n\nalways suspect.    Means, however, may be.\"   BCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 330.     The Supreme Court has explained that the motive of\n\nincreasing minority participation and access is not suspect.    See,\n\n\n\n     17\n      See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 311-12\n& 319 (1978) (noting that a \"diverse student body . . . is a\nconstitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher\neducation\" but striking down a two-track medical school admissions\nsystem that used \"explicit racial classification[s]\") (opinion of\nPowell, J.); Gratz v.

JA Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 507 (1989)\n\n(approving the use of race-neutral means to increase minority\n\nparticipation in governmental programs).\n\n             We said as much in Raso v. Lago, 135 F.3d 11 (1998),\n\nwhere we considered an equal protection and § 1983 challenge to a\n\nfacially race-neutral policy change regarding the award of housing\n\nunits that, at the end of the day, resulted in fewer white\n\nresidents receiving a preference for the units to which they would\n\nhave otherwise been entitled because of their prior residency.\n\nAfter acknowledging that the change in policy was motivated by a\n\ndesire to ensure that all races had equal access to the new\n\nhousing, we stated that \"plaintiffs are mistaken in treating\n\n'racial motive' as a synonym for a constitutional violation.\" Raso,\n\n135 F.3d at 16.\n\n             Employing   de   novo review    and    placing     Superintendent\n\nPayzant's cited testimony in the context of the entire record, we\n\nfind that the plaintiffs have not shown that the defendants' use of\n\nthe   word    \"diversity\"     was   simply   a     subterfuge    for    \"racial\n\nbalancing.\" While defendants frankly acknowledged that they valued\n\nthe degree of integration BPS had attained since it came under\n\nfederal court order thirty years ago, their analyses using actual\n\nparental choice patterns showed that removing the racial guidelines\n\nof the Old Plan and the maintenance of a 100% walk-zone preference\n\nwould not significantly erode those integration gains.                 BPS then\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\fresisted pressure to adhere to strict racial balancing, even with\n\nRIL funds potentially on the table, and adopted the race-neutral\n\nNew Plan.    To increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome on\n\ndiversity   and   to   promote   \"school   improvement,    continuity   and\n\nstability of placement, and equitable distribution of resources and\n\neducational opportunity district-wide,\" as well as the system's\n\nongoing goals of \"excellence, equity and diversity,\" the defendants\n\nopted for the 50% walk-zone preference.\n\n            As the district court put it, Superintendent Payzant's\n\nreference to diversity \"simply restated his more convincing point\n\nthat the revised assignment plan is intended to address issues of\n\nequity by giving parents in under-served neighborhoods fairer\n\naccess to the school system's resources.\"       BCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 332.   To the extent that the School Committee's adoption of the\n\nNew Plan promoted choice and equitable access to BPS resources for\n\nall students in the BPS system, as well as diversity, there is\n\nnothing in that mix of goals or the means of achieving them that\n\ntriggers strict scrutiny under our own precedents or those of the\n\nSupreme Court.\n\n                       c.   Disproportionate effect\n\n            Having rejected plaintiffs' claims that the history of\n\nthe New Plan's adoption, and its stated goal of diversity, require\n\nthe application of strict scrutiny review, we now turn to their\n\nevidence regarding the impact of the New Plan.            As we previously\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\fnoted, a disproportionate racial effect of a policy can be evidence\n\nof an invidious discriminatory purpose.   Although plaintiffs cite\n\nto \"individual examples of the racial effect\" of the 50% reduction\n\nin walk zone seats under the New Plan, they neither describe these\n\nexamples as a \"disproportionate effect\" nor accept that any such\n\ndisproportionate effect of the New Plan is relevant to establishing\n\ndefendants' purportedly racially discriminatory purpose.   Instead,\n\nthey argue that their individual examples suffice to establish an\n\nequal protection violation.     Before explaining how plaintiffs\n\napparently misunderstand the relevant case law and their resultant\n\nevidentiary burden in this case, we first recount the evidence they\n\npresented on the racial effect of the New Plan.\n\n          To establish the allegedly discriminatory effect of the\n\nNew Plan's reduction of the walk zone preference from 100% to 50%\n\nof available seats, plaintiffs relied exclusively on the testimony\n\nof Ann Walsh, president of Boston's Children First.18      Although\n\nWalsh testified that she reviewed admissions data from \"every\n\nschool in the city,\" she only presented data for the 2002-03\n\nadmission rounds for one class in each of three schools: a pre-\n\nkindergarten program at the Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Elementary\n\n\n\n     18\n      Walsh has a Master's Degree in mathematics and was enrolled\nin law school while the trial was ongoing. BCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d\nat 328. She also was \"a couple of courses short a Master's Degree\nin computer science.\" Id. (quoting the trial transcript). Walsh\n\"has never worked as a statistician,\" id., and apparently lacks\nformal training in that area.\n\n                               -37-\n\fSchool, and two kindergarten programs at the Richard J. Murphy\n\nElementary School and the Mary Lyon Elementary School.         Walsh\n\ntestified that she selected these particular schools because she\n\n\"looked for schools with white walkers who were pushed aside by the\n\n[change to a] 50% [walk zone preference], and [these three schools\n\nwere] an example of that.\"\n\n          Walsh prepared one-page charts for each of these schools,\n\ncomparing the racial demographics of students who were admitted to\n\nthe selected classes under the New Plan, with its 50% walk zone\n\npreference, to the racial demographics of students who would have\n\nbeen admitted if a full 100% of the seats had been reserved for\n\nstudents who lived within the walk zone.      Walsh's testimony, and\n\nthe charts she prepared for this litigation, show that in the three\n\nelementary schools--out of the 85 or so in the BPS system--a total\n\nof twenty white students who would have been admitted under a\n\nhypothetical 100% walk zone preference were not admitted under the\n\nactual 50% walk zone preference.      In plaintiffs' view, with this\n\nshowing of \"individual examples of the racial effect\" of the change\n\nin the walk zone preference, there was no need to engage in any\n\nsystemwide analysis of the racial impact of the walk zone seat\n\nreduction.   Indeed, Walsh did not attempt to project a systemwide\n\nimpact from her three-school analysis.    Walsh explicitly testified\n\nthat she is \"opposed to the concept that the overall impact on the\n\nschool system is the issue.\"\n\n\n                               -38-\n\f             Plaintiffs erred in this minimalist approach to their\n\nevidentiary burden in this case.        To be sure, the Equal Protection\n\nClause protects individuals: \"rights created by the first section\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the\n\nindividual.     The rights established are personal rights.\" Shelley\n\nv. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 22 (1948).             When a governmental policy\n\nemploys overt racial classifications, the impact of race on an\n\nindividual outcome is clear.        As we have explained, courts will\n\nthen apply strict scrutiny to determine whether the use of the\n\nracial classification is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling\n\nstate interest.     See, e.g., Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 275-\n\n76 (2003).     As we discuss infra in Part III.D., the Old Plan used\n\nexplicit racial guidelines, and two plaintiffs in this case--John\n\nFeeney and Kathleen McCoy--showed that they were denied seats at\n\ntheir schools of choice under the Old Plan because of their race\n\nand   the    imposition   of   racial   caps    in   force   at   that   time.\n\nAccordingly, they were awarded nominal damages in recognition of\n\nthat injury.\n\n             In contrast, when evaluating a facially race-neutral\n\npolicy, the impact of race on an individual outcome is not always\n\nimmediately clear.     Courts can only infer that an invidious racial\n\npurpose motivated a facially neutral policy when that policy\n\ncreates     disproportionate   racial   results.       \"Sometimes    a   clear\n\npattern, unexplainable on grounds other than race, emerges from the\n\n\n                                   -39-\n\feffect of the state action even when the governing legislation\n\nappears neutral on its face.\"      Village of Arlington Heights v.\n\nMetropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 (1977) (emphasis\n\nadded).     See also Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976)\n\n(\"an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from\n\nthe totality of the relevant facts, including the fact, if it is\n\ntrue, that the law bears more heavily on one race than another.\").\n\n            In this context, showing only isolated instances of\n\nstudents not receiving assignments at their first choice schools is\n\ninsufficient.    Here, there is no clear pattern of disparate racial\n\nimpact, much less the \"stark\" pattern contemplated by Arlington\n\nHeights.    Id. (\"Absent a pattern as stark as that in Gomillion or\n\nYick Wo, impact alone is not determinative . . . .\") (footnotes\n\nomitted).     At most, plaintiffs have established that in three\n\nschools the reduction from 100% to 50% of seats set aside for\n\nstudents in the walk zone resulted in twenty white students, out of\n\nthe approximately 25,000 or so elementary (K-5) students in the BPS\n\nsystem, not being assigned to their first choice school.       More\n\nrelevantly, Walsh's own charts show that seven of the twenty\n\nstudents who actually were assigned to the disputed seats were\n\nwhite, meaning that the impact on whites as a group was a net loss\n\nof thirteen seats.19   Isolated examples that only show a small net\n\n\n     19\n      Specifically, in terms of net numbers, plaintiffs showed that\neight fewer white students were admitted to the Murphy School under\nthe New Plan's 50% walk zone preference as compared to a 100% walk\n\n                                -40-\n\floss of seats to white students in selected schools is a far cry\n\nfrom showing that the New Plan disproportionately affects white\n\nstudents in the BPS system.              In fact, as the district court\n\nemphasized, even with the reduction in walk zone seats, \"in the\n\n2002-2003 school year, 80 percent of white applicants received\n\ntheir first choice of schools, as compared to 77 percent of black\n\napplicants.\"   BCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d at 332.\n\n          Even if this showing could be characterized as evidence\n\nof a disproportionate effect, a characterization which we reject,\n\nthe \"individual examples of the racial effect\" cited by plaintiffs\n\nare explainable \"on grounds other than race.\" Arlington Heights,\n\n429 U.S. at 266.    As the district court found, plaintiffs \"have not\n\nbeen able to show [] that the loss was due to discrimination . . .\n\n. Rather, as defendants point out, white students have been denied\n\nadmission to certain schools, not because they were forced to\n\ncompete on a non-level playing field, but because their parents\n\nhave tended to over-choose these same schools.\"             BCF IV, 260 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 332.    If plaintiffs had been able to show that the New\n\nPlan resulted in stark systemwide racial disparities regarding\n\nassignments to first choice schools, we might--depending on the\n\ncircumstances--have     reached     the     conclusion    that   intentional\n\ndiscrimination     occurred   and   so    adopt   a   stricter   standard   of\n\n\n\nzone preference; three fewer at the Mozart School; and two fewer at\nthe Lyon School.\n\n                                    -41-\n\fscrutiny in assessing justification. Plaintiffs chose, however, to\n\neschew such analysis.\n\n           The BCF IV court rightly concluded that plaintiffs'\n\nevidence fails to show any disproportionate effect of the New\n\nPolicy.\n\n           [I]t was open to plaintiffs to show that the\n           reduction in the walk zone preference has had\n           a disproportionate impact on white children,\n           that is, that a greater percentage of white\n           students have found themselves shut out of\n           their neighborhood schools. This plaintiffs\n           have not done.\n\nId.   at   331-32.   With    plaintiffs   having   shown   no   racial\n\nclassification at play in the New Plan, no discriminatory purpose\n\nfor its adoption, and no discriminatory effect of its application,\n\nwe cannot conclude that the plan \"in some sense was designed to\n\naccord disparate treatment on the basis of racial considerations.\"\n\nWashington v. Seattle School Dist., 458 U.S. 457, 485 (1982).\n\nConsequently, the district court correctly held that the New Plan\n\nwas not subject to strict scrutiny.20\n\n\n\n                     3.   Rational Basis Review\n\n\n\n\n      20\n      We also note that plaintiffs' extensive reliance on Wessmann\nis misplaced. Without belaboring the point, the admissions plan in\nWessmann subjected a certain number of seats to strict numerical\nracial guidelines. Here, in contrast, the New Plan is facially\nrace-neutral with no mention of race, racial classifications, set-\nasides, or quotas.\n\n                                -42-\n\f            Instead, since race-based classifications are not in play\n\nand plaintiffs failed to show that the New Plan was adopted with a\n\ndiscriminatory purpose, the New Plan must only survive rational\n\nbasis review: as long as the plan is rationally related to a\n\nlegitimate governmental interest, it must be upheld.      See, e.g.,\n\nRomer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631 (1996) (holding that \"if a law\n\nneither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, we\n\nwill uphold the legislative classification so long as it bears a\n\nrational relation to some legitimate end\").\n\n            As we have explained at some length, defendants adopted\n\nthe New Plan to foster \"excellence, equity and diversity through\n\naccess and educational opportunity throughout the Boston Public\n\nSchools.\"    All of those goals are legitimate state interests, and\n\nthe assignment process of the New Plan is rationally related to\n\nachieving them.    Plaintiffs do not contend otherwise.      Again, we\n\nthink the district court said it well:\n\n            Because the School Committee has rescinded the\n            use of any form of racial classification,\n            direct or indirect, in the New Choice Plan,\n            its stated objectives of preserving parental\n            choice and opportunity, particularly for\n            parents who would otherwise be restricted in\n            their choice of schools, and of fostering\n            school excellence by permitting parents to\n            vote    with   their    feet,   satisfy    the\n            reasonableness test.\n\nBCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d at 333.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -43-\n\f              Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs' claims that the New\n\nPlan violates their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, Title VI, or §§ 1981 and 1983.\n\n                          4.     Article 111 Claim\n\n              Although plaintiffs argue in their opening brief to this\n\ncourt that the Old Plan violated Article 111 of the Amendments to\n\nthe Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, they only summarily state\n\nonce that \"the District Court should have subjected the New Plan to\n\nStrict Scrutiny under Article 111,\" (emphasis added), citing to\n\nComfort ex rel. Neumyer v. Lynn School Comm., 283 F. Supp. 2d 328\n\n(D.   Mass.    2003)   without   comment.    When    a    party   includes   no\n\ndeveloped argumentation on a point, as is the case here, we treat\n\nthe argument as waived under our well established rule. See United\n\nStates v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"We have\n\nsteadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory\n\nmanner,    not     accompanied      by   developed       argumentation.\").\n\n              We make two points, however.     First, in the context of\n\narguing that the Old Plan violated Article 111, plaintiffs claim\n\nthat the \"Comfort Court held that under Art. 111, school assignment\n\nplans that deny students an assignment to their neighborhood\n\nschools are subject to strict scrutiny . . . .\"               This misstates\n\nComfort.      Comfort, 237 F. Supp. 2d at 366 (\"I recognize . . . the\n\nneed to proceed with caution. . . .         [A]lthough I am convinced by\n\namici that intermediate scrutiny is the correct test to apply here,\n\n\n                                     -44-\n\fmy analysis below will apply the more rigorous standard which the\n\nparties    have   briefed,    strict     scrutiny.\")     Second,   and    more\n\nimportantly, given our disposition of the federal claims, we would\n\nnot find that the New Plan assigns students \"on the basis of race,\n\ncolor, national origin or creed.\"          Mass. Const. amend. art. 111.\n\n                    C. Prospective Injunctive Relief\n\n            Injunctive relief21 is a discretionary remedy.               Thus,\n\nappellate courts typically review grants or denials of such relief\n\nonly for abuse of discretion.       Caroline T. v. Hudson School Dist.,\n\n915 F.2d 752, 754 (1st Cir. 1990).         However, to the extent that the\n\ndisposition of the request for an injunction turns on an issue of\n\nlaw, such as lack of standing or mootness, appellate courts review\n\nsuch determinations de novo.           See Langlois v. Abington Housing\n\nAuthority, 207 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 2000) (observing that although\n\ninjunctions are typically reviewed for abuse of discretion, \"the\n\nstandard    of    review     obviously    depends   on   the   issue     under\n\nconsideration. Generally speaking, pure issues of law . . . are\n\nreviewed de novo, findings of fact for clear error, and 'judgment\n\ncalls' with considerable deference depending upon the issue.\")\n\n\n     21\n      In their brief to this court, plaintiffs' request for\nprospective injunctive relief was limited to a prohibitory\ninjunction against the future use of the Old Plan. However, the\ndistrict court ruling on this issue addressed one of the broader\nprohibitory injunctions plaintiffs sought during litigation--\nnamely, an injunction proscribing the future use of race in the\nstudent assignment system in any way. BCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d at\n333.   Because of our disposition of this issue on appeal, the\ndiscrepancy between these two requests is immaterial.\n\n                                    -45-\n\f          Plaintiffs       argue    that     the   district   court   erred   by\n\ndismissing their request for an injunction against BPS's future use\n\nof race because of a lack of standing, citing to BCF II, 98 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 117 and BCF III, 183 F. Supp. 2d at 395, without\n\nquoting any language of the district court. Plaintiffs misread the\n\ndistrict court's holdings.           The district court in fact did not\n\ndismiss the plaintiffs' request for a prohibitory injunction for\n\nlack of standing.    As it noted in its May 21, 2002 Memorandum and\n\nOrder regarding this standing issue:\n\n          In a January 25, 2002 Memorandum and Order\n          [BCF III], the court found that while\n          plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue immediate\n          injunctive relief (given the absence of any\n          cognizable injury), there was a strong\n          possibility that one or more plaintiffs had\n          standing to seek prospective relief enjoining\n          any racially-based allocation of walk zone\n          preferences. . . .    Consequently, the court\n          afforded   plaintiffs   an   opportunity   \"for\n          further   briefing   of   the   Lesage   issues\n          identified in this opinion, as well as issues\n          of a constitutional dimension raised by the\n          School   Committee's   walk   zone   preference\n          policy.\" [citing BCF III, 183 F. Supp. 2d at\n          403.]\n\nBoston's Children First v. Boston School Comm., No. Civ. A. 99-\n\n11330-RGS, 2002 WL 1058923, at *1 (D. Mass. May 21, 2002) (citation\n\nomitted) (\"May 21 Order\").         The \"Lesage issues\" identified in this\n\nMay 21 Order relate to the standing and mootness discussion in BCF\n\nIII, 183 F. Supp. 2d at 392-95.\n\n          In   the   May    21     Order,    which   addressed,   inter   alia,\n\nplaintiffs' standing to seek the requested prohibitory injunction,\n\n                                      -46-\n\fthe district court explained that seven of the ten plaintiffs22\n\neither \"attested to having applied for year 2002-2003 admission to\n\nschools within their walk zones\" or \"attest[ed] to their intention\n\nto remain in the Boston public school system to apply for middle\n\nschool assignments within their respective walk zones.\"      May 21\n\nOrder at *1.   The district court then concluded that \"under Lesage\n\neach [of the seven] has demonstrated standing to seek forward-\n\nlooking relief.\"   Id.\n\n           Here, then, the district court explicitly held that seven\n\nof the plaintiffs had standing to seek an injunction prohibiting\n\nBPS from the unconstitutional use of race in future assignment\n\nsystems.   As can be seen from both the May 21 Order and the\n\ntreatment of plaintiffs' request for forward-looking relief in BCF\n\nIV, which we discuss next, the district court did not dismiss this\n\nclaim for want of standing.   Accordingly, we can dispense with any\n\nfurther analysis on that ground.\n\n           After a bench trial on the merits, the district court\n\ndenied plaintiffs' requests to enjoin defendants from the future\n\nuse of race and to retain jurisdiction over the assignment system.\n\nBCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d at 333-34.       Plaintiffs claim that the\n\n\n\n\n     22\n      These seven plaintiffs were Nicholas Anderson, Kayleigh\nBarry-Meltzer, Michael Gattozzi, Kathleen McCoy, John O'Toole,\nAndrew Sharaffa, and Thomas Stoddard.       The three remaining\nplaintiffs--John Feeney, Jamie Lee Higgins, and Sean Stoddard--\nfailed to attest that they intended to reapply for placement.\n\n                                -47-\n\fdistrict court misapplied City of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle,\n\nInc., 455 U.S. 283 (1982) in so ruling.             There was no such error.\n\n            We discussed City of Mesquite in New England Regional\n\nCouncil of Carpenters v. Kinton, 284 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2002), where\n\nwe held that when a governmental entity revised a challenged policy\n\nto remove the offending language, plaintiffs' claim for injunctive\n\nrelief was mooted.        Id. at 18.     Directly addressing the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in City of Mesquite, we explained that the Supreme\n\nCourt had    \"held   that   'a   voluntary     cessation     of   a    challenged\n\npractice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine\n\nthe legality of the practice.'\" Id. (quoting City of Mesquite, 455\n\nU.S. at 289).   This is precisely the City of Mesquite language upon\n\nwhich plaintiffs rely.       As we made clear in Kinton, though, this\n\nreliance is misplaced: \"Under circuit precedent . . . the City of\n\nMesquite    exception   applies      'only   when    there   is   a    reasonable\n\nexpectation that the challenged conduct will be repeated following\n\ndismissal of the case.'\"         Kinton, 284 F.3d at 18 (quoting D.H.L.\n\nAssocs., Inc. v. O'Gorman, 199 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 1999)).               There\n\nis no such reasonable expectation here.               As the district court\n\nobserved in BCF IV: \"Mere skepticism . . . about the defendants'\n\nfuture     intentions[]     cannot     justify      the   type    of    judicial\n\nintervention that plaintiffs seek.\"           BCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n333.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -48-\n\f           Whether this ruling is characterized as one based on\n\nmootness concerns (reviewed de novo) or on the merits (reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion), we find that the district court did not err\n\nin denying plaintiffs' claims for an injunction prohibiting BPS\n\nfrom the unconstitutional use of race in future student assignment\n\nplans.   Defendants have voluntarily abandoned the unconstitutional\n\nuse of race in all of its student assignment systems, and they have\n\nexpressed in testimony and in letters to the Racial Imbalance\n\nAdvisory Council and the Board of Education their strong desire to\n\ncomply with constitutional requirements in all future assignment\n\nsystems.      As we have discussed supra in Part III.B.2.b, the\n\ndefendants' commitment to diversity is not per se constitutionally\n\nsuspect.      While there is ample evidence that defendants will\n\ncontinue to monitor relevant school demographics and will consider\n\nmodifying the current assignment system to meet all of their stated\n\ngoals, including diversity, plaintiffs have been unable to show any\n\nreasonable      expectation    that   defendants   will   return   to\n\nunconstitutional means to achieve those goals. Accordingly, we see\n\nno reason to overturn the district court's denial of the requested\n\nprohibitory injunction.\n\n                          D.   Nominal Damages\n\n             Finally, in BCF V, the district court found that only two\n\nplaintiffs were denied their preferred choice of schools because of\n\ntheir race under the Old Plan, and to those two plaintiffs the\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\fdistrict court awarded nominal damages.     BCF V, at 2 (awarding\n\n$1.00 each to John Feeney and Kathleen McCoy).23    On appeal, the\n\neight remaining plaintiffs seek nominal damages as well, claiming\n\nthat the district court erred in two regards.\n\n          First, plaintiffs state that\n\n          [i]t is impossible to deconstruct what\n          assignments would have been made under the Old\n          Plan had race not been a factor.      The BPS\n          Director of Records Management admitted that\n          he could not simulate for how [sic] choices\n          would have changed had the racial caps and set\n          asides of the Old Plan not been in place.\n\nPlaintiffs provide no citation to support this contention, and the\n\ndistrict court found as a matter of fact that BPS did indeed\n\ndemonstrate that the other eight plaintiffs were not denied seats\n\nat their preferred schools because of race.     See BCF III, 183 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 387-91 (detailing the assignment histories of each\n\nplaintiff); see also BCF V.   As we review factual determinations\n\nfor clear error, Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 795, and plaintiffs have\n\n\n     23\n      For the 2000-01 school year, John Feeney applied in the third\napplication round for a kindergarten seat, ranking five schools in\norder of his preference. The first two had been filled in earlier\nrounds. He was not assigned to his third and fourth choice schools\nbecause under the racial guidelines then in force, no more seats\nwere available for white students.     As a result, the remaining\navailable seats were assigned to black students with worse random\nnumbers. BCF III, 183 F. Supp. 2d at 388-89.\n     Similarly, for the 1996 school year, Kathleen McCoy applied\nfor assignment to four schools. She was unsuccessful in gaining\nassignment to her first and second choice schools. At her third\nchoice school, Condon, she was denied a seat solely because of the\noperation of the racial guidelines; black students with worse\nrandom numbers than hers received assignments to Condon instead.\nId. at 389.\n\n                               -50-\n\fpointed to no record evidence to contradict the district court's\n\nrelevant factual findings, we leave them undisturbed on appeal.\n\n             Second, plaintiffs claim that the district court misread\n\nTexas v. Lesage, 528 U.S. 18 (1999) (per curiam).               In Lesage, the\n\nUniversity of Texas denied a Caucasian applicant admission to a\n\nPh.D. program while admitting at least one minority candidate. The\n\nparties   agreed      that   \"the   school   considered   the    race   of   its\n\napplicants at some stage during the review process.\"                Id. at 19.\n\nThe University showed that \"even if the school's admissions process\n\nhad   been   completely      colorblind,     Lesage   would   not   have     been\n\nadmitted.\"      Id.     The Supreme Court held that if a defendant\n\n\"conclusively established that [plaintiff] would have been rejected\n\nunder a race-neutral policy,\" damages are not available.                Id. at\n\n20.   The Court could not have been clearer:            \"The government can\n\navoid liability by proving that it would have made the same\n\ndecision without the impermissible motive.\"             Id. at 21 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n             Plaintiffs claim that the \"same decision\" defense set\n\nforth in Lesage is not available against claims for nominal damages\n\nfor constitutional violations. Plaintiffs misread Lesage in making\n\nthis argument.        Lesage makes no distinction among the classes of\n\ndamages that become unavailable upon defendants' showing that they\n\nwould have reached the same admissions result even in the absence\n\n\n\n\n                                      -51-\n\fof an unconstitutional use of race.               Lesage, 528 U.S. at 20.\n\nLesage is unambiguous:\n\n            Simply put, where a plaintiff challenges a\n            discrete governmental decision as being based\n            on an impermissible criterion and it is\n            undisputed that the government would have made\n            the same decision regardless, there is no\n            cognizable injury warranting relief under §\n            1983.\n\nId. at 21.        Lesage did not limit this holding to compensatory\n\ndamages or qualify the type of relief in any way, other than to\n\nmention that the case arose under § 1983.            There is no doubt that\n\nnominal damages are one of the forms of relief available under §\n\n1983.    See Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 112 (1992) (stating that\n\nin a § 1983 action,        Supreme Court precedent \"obligates a court to\n\naward nominal damages when a plaintiff establishes the violation of\n\nhis right to procedural due process but cannot prove actual injury.\")\n\n            As Farrar explains, where there is a deprivation of\n\nconstitutional rights that do not result in an \"actual injury\"\n\ngiving rise to compensatory damages, nominal damages are the\n\nappropriate remedy.        See also      Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266\n\n(1978).    However, Lesage makes clear that when the governmental\n\nentity    would    have    made    the   same   decision   even   without    the\n\nimpermissible consideration of race--as it did here for eight of\n\nthe plaintiffs--there is no deprivation of constitutional rights at\n\nall.      Lesage,    528    U.S.   at    21.    Without    a   deprivation   of\n\n\n\n\n                                         -52-\n\fconstitutional rights, liability will not attach, and damages--\n\nnominal, compensatory, or otherwise--cannot be imposed.                Id.\n\n          In sum, we find no error in the district court's factual\n\nfindings that the eight plaintiffs seeking nominal damages on\n\nappeal would not have been admitted to the school of their choice\n\neven if BPS had not impermissibly considered race under the Old\n\nPlan.   Further,    we   find     no    error   in   the    district   court's\n\napplication   of   Lesage   and    other      relevant     precedent   to    the\n\nplaintiffs' claims for nominal damages.\n\n                                       IV.\n\n          This case comes to us in the semi-centenary year of Brown\n\nv. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954).                There, the Supreme\n\nCourt described the importance of public education:\n\n          Today, education is perhaps the most important\n          function of state and local governments.\n          Compulsory school attendance laws and the\n          great   expenditures    for   education   both\n          demonstrate our recognition of the importance\n          of education to our democratic society. It is\n          required in the performance of our most basic\n          public responsibilities, even service in the\n          armed forces. It is the very foundation of\n          good citizenship. Today it is a principal\n          instrument in awakening the child to cultural\n          values,   in    preparing   him    for   later\n          professional training, and in helping him to\n          adjust normally to his environment. In these\n          days, it is doubtful that any child may\n          reasonably be expected to succeed in life if\n          he is denied the opportunity of an education.\n\nBrown, 347 U.S. at 493.     Given these high stakes in the access to\n\npublic education, it is not surprising that this case and those\n\n\n                                       -53-\n\fthat preceded it have inspired deep passions among the parties and\n\ntheir supporters.     Indeed, in histories already written about the\n\naftermath of Brown in our large cities, Boston has often been cited\n\nas a city that resisted fiercely the mandate of Brown and the\n\nmeasures required to dismantle a public school system segregated by\n\ngovernment action.\n\n          Hopefully, future histories will also tell the rest of\n\nthe story.        Attitudes     in    Boston    have   evolved,    policies    have\n\nchanged, institutions have reorganized.                In many ways, the social\n\nfabric has been re-knit.             But this healing has not lowered the\n\nstakes in public education.           People of good faith, harboring only\n\nthe best of intentions, can--and do--disagree about the ultimate\n\nresolution of the difficult legal and social issues that surround\n\npublic   education        generally      and     school    assignment    systems\n\nspecifically.      These continuing disagreements do not diminish all\n\nthat has been accomplished.\n\n          In the end, we are grateful to the parties and their\n\nattorneys,   as    well    as   the    amicus    curiae,   whose    advocacy    has\n\nilluminated the difficult issues before us.                We also express our\n\nappreciation to the able district court judges who thoughtfully and\n\nthoroughly addressed the many complex and difficult issues in this\n\ncase. The fact-finding and careful reasoning set forth in the four\n\npublished opinions in this case have significantly aided our review\n\non appeal.\n\n\n                                        -54-\n\f           For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the\n\ndistrict court are AFFIRMED in all respects.   No costs shall be\n\nawarded.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -55-\n\f",

Boston School Comm.,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d 318, 319 (D.Mass.2003). That cautious prediction may be accurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boston's Children First, a non-profit advocacy group, and parents of several white students sued the City of Boston, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, Boston Public Schools (BPS) Superintendent Thomas Payzant, and members of the Boston School Committee (collectively, the defendants), claiming that BPS's now-defunct race-conscious assignment system violated their children's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981 and 1983, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d (commonly known as Title VI), and Article 111 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Prompted at least in part by the lawsuit against them, the Boston School Committee, at the recommendation of Superintendent Payzant, voted to remove the racial guidelines from the assignment system on July 14, 1999. After BPS adopted a facially race-neutral assignment plan in November 1999, the plaintiffs continued to press their suit, seeking declaratory relief, several forms of injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and nominal damages. Over the course of four rulings, the district court denied all of plaintiffs' claims save one: an award of nominal damages of $1.00 each to the two students who would have been assigned to the school of their choice under the old system but for their race. Plaintiffs appeal. Finding no error, we affirm the district court rulings in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With four published district court decisions setting out the factual background of this case in considerable detail, we limit ourselves here to a recitation of the facts most pertinent to the issues before us on appeal. For greater detail, we refer readers to <i>Boston's Children First v. City of Boston,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d 247 (D.Mass.1999) (\"<i>BCF I</i>\"); <i>Boston's Children First v. City of Boston,</i> 98 F.Supp.2d 111 (D.Mass. 2000) (\"<i>BCF II</i>\"); <i>Boston's Children First v. Boston School Comm.,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d 382 (D.Mass.2002) (\"<i>BCF III</i>\"); and <i>Boston's Children First v. Boston School Comm.,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d 318 (D.Mass.2003) (\"<i>BCF IV</i>\"). Additionally, the majority and dissenting opinions in <i>Wessmann v. Gittens,</i> 160 F.3d 790 (1st Cir.1998), provide a useful historical overview of BPS's desegregation-related litigation in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In quick review, thirty years ago the Massachusetts federal district court held that the City of Boston promoted and maintained a racially segregated dual public school system in violation of constitutionally guaranteed rights. <i>Morgan</i> v. <i>Hennigan,</i> 379 F.Supp. 410, 482 (D.Mass. 1974). After twelve years of supervision by the district court, the court returned control over student assignments to BPS, declaring that BPS's student assignment system had achieved unitariness, <i>Morgan v. Nucci,</i> 831 F.2d 313, 318 (1st Cir.1987), \"i.e. a fully integrated, non-segregated system.\" <i>Id.</i> at 316. At that point, BPS adopted an assignment system known as the Controlled Choice Student Assignment Plan, (the \"Old Plan\"), which went into effect for the 1989-90 academic year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Old Plan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BPS assigns students to schools at the transition grades during students' public school careers, each of which corresponds to a student's advancement to a new type of school: kindergarten 1 (programs for 4-year-olds), kindergarten 2 (programs for five-year-olds), first grade (elementary school), sixth grade (middle school), and ninth grade (high school). While high school assignments are made on a citywide basis, Boston is divided into three Attendance Zones &#8212; the North, East, and West Zones &#8212; for purposes of the elementary and middle school assignments at issue in this case. These zones were drawn by the district court as part of its desegregation orders, and the lines largely hew to major transportation routes to keep traditional neighborhoods intact as much as possible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Students are eligible to attend any of the schools located in the Attendance Zone in which the students reside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the assignment process, students rank their preferences for the schools within their Attendance Zone, as well as for the few schools that accept students from any part of the city without regard to Attendance Zone lines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Students whose siblings attend a school receive a preference for that school during the assignment process. Similarly, students who live within the walk zone<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> of a given school receive a preference for seats at that school. Finally, every student receives a randomly assigned lottery number, with the lower numbers being considered more advantageous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Old Plan, BPS assigned students to schools using the following criteria: the student's rank preference for the school; whether a sibling already attended the school; whether the student lived within the school's walk zone; whether the student had already matriculated at the school on a temporary basis;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and, as a tie-breaker, the student's random number, with a lower random number winning out over higher numbers. Assignments under the Old Plan operated with one additional constraint &#8212; the \"ideal racial percentage\" for each grade's population, as calculated by the racial and ethnic composition of the student population in that grade within each of the three Attendance Zones. If admitting a student would cause a deviation of more than 15% from the \"ideal racial percentage,\" that student would not be admitted. The Old Plan operated largely without change for ten years, from 1989 through 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>B. Boston's Exam School Assignment System and Related \"Reverse Discrimination\" Lawsuits</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1999, the first four of what ultimately became ten individual plaintiffs, along with Boston's Children First,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> filed this lawsuit, prompted in part by the successful \"reverse discrimination\" lawsuits brought by the families of two white children who were denied admission to their choice of one of BPS's three competitive exam schools. <i>See McLaughlin v. Boston School Comm.,</i> 938 F.Supp. 1001 (D.Mass. 1996); <i>Wessmann v. Gittens,</i> 160 F.3d 790 (1st Cir.1998). These exam schools admit students using a different system than that used by the other schools in the BPS system. At the time Julia McLaughlin applied to Boston Latin School, admissions were based on a combination of an applicant's grade point average and standardized test scores (collectively called the \"z-score\"), subject to a 35% minority set-aside previously imposed by the federal desegregation order and still in effect at that time. After McLaughlin filed suit and obtained a preliminary injunction admitting her to Boston Latin, BPS voluntarily discontinued use of the 35% quota, admitted students similarly situated to McLaughlin, and commissioned a consulting company to devise a new admissions policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The replacement exam school admission policy eventually adopted by BPS defined the \"qualified applicant pool\" for each exam school as the 50% of students with z-scores above the mean in any given year. Then, BPS filled half of each exam school's seats based on the students' expressed preferences for each school and their rank order z-scores. The remainder of the seats were also allocated by students' school preferences and rank order z-scores, subject to mirroring the racial composition of the remaining qualified applicant pool not yet admitted. Sarah Wessmann was denied admission to Boston Latin under the new exam school admission system, sued, and ultimately prevailed on appeal. We found the admission system unconstitutional because its use of racial classifications was not narrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest. <i>See Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 807-09.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The New Plan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based in no small part on Superintendent Payzant's frank assessment to the School Committee that, in light of <i>Wessmann</i> and other reverse discrimination lawsuits, plaintiffs in this case would almost certainly prevail in their challenge to the Old Plan, the School Committee voted on July 14, 1999, to discontinue the use of the racial classifications in the Old Plan. <i>See BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 324 n. 10. At the time of this vote, the School Committee also charged the Superintendent with developing a new student assignment plan that did not consider \"race as a factor in making student assignments\" and would also reflect \"other changes necessary to maximize access to choice, to support diversity, and promote quality education for the children of the City of Boston.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20 and November 3, 1999, the Superintendent recommended that the Old Plan be further modified in two salient ways: by reducing the percentage of available seats allocated for students within a school's walk zone from 100% to 50%, and by treating students who did not actually live within the walk zone of any school as though they had a walk-zone preference for their first or second choice school. On November 10, the School Committee adopted the Superintendent's recommendations to the Controlled Choice Student Assignment Plan with the modification that students lacking a walk-zone school would be given a walk-zone preference for both their first and second choice schools. For convenience, we refer to the modified Controlled Choice Student Assignment Plan as the \"New Plan.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the New Plan, which went into effect for the 2000-01 school year, students still rank their choice of schools and receive random numbers. Students are sorted by their school choice and ordered by their random number, with the lowest numbers put at the top of the list. BPS then computes the number of available seats at each school and sets aside 50% of those seats for students who live within the school's walk zone. The seats at each school are then filled according to the following priorities: first priority to students within the school's walk zone and with a sibling already in attendance; second priority to students outside the school's walk zone but with a sibling already in attendance; and third priority to students within the school's walk zone but with no sibling already in attendance. If there are more students in a priority tier than seats available, the seats will go to the students with the better random numbers. As students are admitted, the system updates the number of walk zone seats that are available. Once those walk zone seats are filled, a student's walk-zone status drops out of consideration and students are assigned in accordance with the school preferences by the rank of their random number.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Finally, the applications and assignments are done in rounds; if a student fails to meet the first round application deadline, she can submit her preferences in the second round, and so on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Course of Litigation Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously mentioned, four plaintiffs and Boston's Children First filed suit in federal district court on June 21, 1999, claiming that the Old Plan violated the Equal Protection Clause, which provides that no State shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\"; 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981 and 1983, which collectively prohibit deprivations of constitutional rights under color of state law; Title VI, which prohibits institutions receiving federal funds from engaging in racial discrimination; and Article 111 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, which states that \"[n]o student shall be assigned to or denied admittance to a public school on the basis of race, color, national origin or creed.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and class certification to represent all similarly situated white children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 14, 1999, the School Committee voted to discontinue the use of race in assignments. On August 10, 1999, the district court denied plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief that would have, <i>inter alia,</i> ordered BPS to cease using race or ethnicity in any phase of the school assignment process and to re-open the assignment process to students who attempted to transfer schools the previous year, as well as those entering kindergarten and first grade. <i>BCF I,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d at 262.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some time after <i>BCF I,</i> six other plaintiff children joined the suit, and plaintiffs' claims for relief expanded considerably. Plaintiffs now sought at least six forms of injunctive relief, including (1) admitting plaintiffs to their schools of choice, (2) enjoining defendants from the use of any race-based practice in all aspects of school assignments and governance, (3) requiring all students in the BPS system to reapply under the terms of the New Plan, (4) dismantling the Attendance Zones, (5) granting Boston's Children First access to BPS records to monitor compliance, and (6) retaining jurisdiction in federal court for three years to monitor compliance. Plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief stating that the New Plan violated their rights under the relevant federal and state laws, nominal damages for all plaintiffs, and compensatory damages for five plaintiffs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> On October 29, BPS moved to dismiss plaintiffs' claims, arguing that the suit was moot in light of its voluntary discontinuance of the Old Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 19, 2000, the <i>BCF II</i> court ruled that all of these claims survived defendants' motion to dismiss, with one exception. Finding that five \"of the plaintiffs did not seek assignments in the 1999-2000 school year and have not indicated any present intention to seek an assignment in the 2000-01 school year,\" the district court held that \"injunctive relief is unnecessary to redress the injuries of these [five] plaintiffs as they have not indicated that they will even participate in the future school assignment plan.\" <i>BCF II,</i> 98 F.Supp.2d at 117. Accordingly, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss in so far as it related to the injunctive relief of those five plaintiffs,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and otherwise denied the motion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>BCF III,</i> the court disposed of additional claims. First, the court dismissed as moot the remaining five plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief admitting them to their school of choice because three plaintiffs (Sharaffa, O'Toole, and Feeney) left the BPS system prior to the 2001 admissions season, and the final two plaintiffs (Higgins and Thomas Stoddard) chose to remain at their current schools. <i>BCF III,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d at 395. Second, the court rejected plaintiffs' claims that the three Attendance Zones were \"racially gerrymandered,\" explaining that \"[b]ecause the zones today, whatever role race may have played in their creation, serve administrative, rather than racial balancing purposes, I conclude that no viable `case or controversy' exists regarding their current configuration.\" <i>Id.</i> at 397-99. This holding disposed of both the injunctive request related to dismantling the Attendance Zones and the declaratory relief request to the extent that it rested on the allegedly racial purpose of the Attendance Zones. Third, the court denied plaintiffs' request for an injunction requiring every student in the BPS system to reapply under the New Plan, explaining that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">even if a showing could be made that one or more of the plaintiffs might derive an advantage from a system-wide reprocessing of all student assignments, any benefit conferred would be outweighed by the consequent demoralization of a school system that has yet to fully absorb the effects of a quarter-century effort to bring itself into compliance with court-ordered desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 401. Fourth, the court held that Boston's Children First lacked standing as an organizational plaintiff to press the lawsuit. <i>Id.</i> at 403.

The <i>BCF IV</i> court found that (1) the New Plan, with its change in the walk zone preference from 100% to 50% of seats, was facially race-neutral, (2) there was no evidence that the policy was applied in a discriminatory manner, and (3) plaintiffs did not show that the policy was adopted with a discriminatory intention and applied in a way that had a discriminatory effect. <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 331-32. Accordingly, the district court declined to apply strict scrutiny to the New Plan. <i>Id.</i> at 333. Instead, it evaluated the New Plan under rational basis review and found that it \"satisf[ied] the reasonableness test.\" <i>Id.</i> The court also held that plaintiffs' \"[m]ere skepticism ... about the defendants' future intentions[ ] cannot justify\" an injunction prohibiting the school system from using race as a factor in the assignment system in the future. In consequence, the court entered judgment for defendants, <i>id.</i> at 334, and noted that it would address the bifurcated claims for nominal damages separately. <i>Id.</i> at n. 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 27, 2003, the court issued a short memorandum and order awarding nominal damages of $1.00 each to Feeney and McCoy because, as BPS admitted, those plaintiffs \"were denied seat assignments at their preferred schools because of their race\" under the Old Plan. <i>Boston's Children First v. Boston School Comm.,</i> No. 99-11330-RGS (D.Mass. May 27, 2003) (unpublished) (<i>\"BCF V\"</i>). The court also held that \"[a]s the remaining plaintiffs can make no showing of a deprivation under <i>Texas v.

First, plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the New Plan is unconstitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Second, plaintiffs seek an injunction prohibiting BPS from using race in any way in a modified school assignment system.

However, when the issues on appeal \"raise[ ] either questions of law or questions about how the law applies to discerned facts,\" such as whether the proffered evidence establishes a discriminatory purpose or a disproportionate racial impact, \"our review is essentially plenary.\" <i>Id.</i> at 795. Similarly, we review <i>de novo</i> the district court's other legal conclusions, <i>Cohen v. Brown Univ.,</i> 101 F.3d 155, 192 (1st Cir.1996), including the level of scrutiny it applied when evaluating the constitutionality of the New Plan and, in the context of denying eight plaintiffs nominal damages, its interpretation of <i>Texas v. Lesage,</i> 528 U.S. 18, 120 S.Ct. 467, 145 L.Ed.2d 347 (1999) (per curiam). Dispositions of a request for injunctive relief are typically \"review[ed] only to ensure that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting, or failing to grant, such relief,\" <i>Caroline T. v. Hudson School Dist.,</i> 915 F.2d 752, 754 (1st Cir. 1990), although related legal determinations, such as mootness, are reviewed under the usual <i>de novo</i> review afforded to all conclusions of law. <i>See Cotter v.

The Constitutionality of the New Plan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A key question in analyzing the constitutionality of the New Plan is whether strict scrutiny or rational basis review applies. Plaintiffs present several arguments that strict scrutiny applies, including that the unconstitutionality of the Old Plan<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> requires a presumption that the New Plan is unconstitutional and that the defendants' stated goal of diversity requires a finding that the New Plan is unconstitutional. Even if those arguments fail, plaintiffs contend, the New Plan has a discriminatory effect from which a discriminatory intent can be inferred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1. <i>Adoption of the New Plan</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When designing and choosing among methods for assigning students to schools, school boards seek to promote certain values and policies, and they operate within certain historical, political, financial, and legal constraints. Defendants in this case are no exception. As they considered the adoption of the New Plan in 1999, they saw a system burdened with a significant inequity in the number of walk zone schools available to students in different parts of the city. For example, while about 30% of elementary school students had only one to three walk zone choices, approximately 37% had six to ten. In fact, when the New Plan was adopted in November 1999, 1772 students were not within the walk zone of any school. Furthermore, at the neighborhood level, some areas of the city had an excess capacity of school seats compared to the number of school-age children, while other areas faced significant shortages. For example, Roxbury and South Dorchester both faced shortages of around 2500 seats, while Jamaica Plain and Allston/Brighton collectively had excess capacity of around 1600 seats. Additionally, some schools in significant demand were over-chosen by parents and students, while others lacked enough applicants to fill the available seats. In the East Zone, where plaintiffs reside, Everett Elementary had 7.3 applicants for each available seat for the 2002-03 academic year, while Lee Elementary had just 0.6 applicants for each available seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantial disparities among the Boston neighborhoods regarding school quality and capacity, numbers of resident students, and walk zone choices were significant considerations in the adoption of the New Plan and its reduction of the walk zone preference to 50% of the seats. Additionally, BPS compiled statistics showing that of the parents and students ranking their school choices, approximately 50% chose a walk zone school as their first choice, while the other 50% chose as their first choice a school whose walk zone did not include the student.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BPS also had been concerned about the potentially resegregative impact of removing the racial guidelines of the Old Plan and simultaneously leaving the 100% walk zone preference in place. Apparently, though, BPS's analysis allayed those concerns, showing that there would be little immediate resegregative effect of removing the racial guidelines. Superintendent Payzant explained to the Massachusetts Board of Education that when the School Committee was considering changes to the Old Plan, BPS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">did some simulations to see what the impact would be as a result of removing race from the plan, and based on the data we had to work with at the time, ... the result of removing race was really very, very small. In fact, we found out we only had three additional schools that would not meet the racial guidelines in one or more grades....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the immediate racial impact of removing the racial guidelines would be \"very small,\" BPS was still concerned about the impact on access and choice that would flow from a 100% walk zone preference. Accordingly, BPS simulated the results of leaving the walk zone preference at 100%, reducing it to 75%, and reducing it to 50%. Ultimately, Superintendent Payzant recommended the 50% reduction in an October 20, 1999, memo to the School Committee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>RATIONALE</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One hundred percent walk zone preference in a controlled choice plan without racial guidelines could result in all available seats being assigned to students within the walk zone. The result would limit choice and access for all students, including those who have no walk zone or live in walk zones where there are insufficient seats to serve the students residing in the walk zone....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until more neighborhoods without schools or with insufficient numbers of schools have [more schools], [a] one hundred percent walk zone preference would limit choice and access for too many families to the schools they want their children to attend. On the other hand, the policy also should and does recognize the interests of families who want to choose a walk zone school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Superintendent Payzant concluded the memo by stating that a 50% walk zone preference \"provides a fair balance and enables the School Committee to establish a policy which will result in progress in meeting the goal[s] of excellence, equity and diversity through access and educational opportunity throughout the Boston Public Schools.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence supports the conclusion that the racial impact of removing the racial guidelines was not significant, and the School Committee adopted the 50% reduction in walk-zone seats primarily because they were concerned about limited choice and equity for students with an insufficient number of walk-zone schools. Additionally, Superintendent Payzant and the School Committee concluded that the 50% reduction was consistent with progress towards BPS's existing goals of excellence, equity, and diversity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. <i>Applicability of Strict Scrutiny Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of race.\" <i>Washington v. Davis,</i> 426 U.S. 229, 239, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976). Accordingly, \"[p]roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\" <i>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp.,</i> 429 U.S. 252, 265, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). When the government uses explicit racial classifications for the distribution of benefits, discriminatory intent is presumed, and those policies are always subjected to strict scrutiny. <i>See, e.g., Pers. Adm'r of Mass. v. Feeney,</i> 442 U.S. 256, 272, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979) (\"A racial classification, regardless of purported motivation, is presumptively invalid and can be upheld only upon an extraordinary justification.\"); <i>Grutter v. Bollinger,</i> 539 U.S. 306, 326, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003) (\"[A]ll racial classifications imposed by government must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\") (internal quotations and citation omitted). \"We apply strict scrutiny to all racial classifications to `smoke out' illegitimate uses of race by assuring that [government] is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool.\" <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 326, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting <i>City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U.S. 469, 493, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (plurality opinion).) The term racial classification \"normally refers to a governmental standard, preferentially favorable to one race or another, for the distribution of benefits.\" <i>Raso v. Lago,</i> 135 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, though, the New Plan does not employ racial classifications. Indeed, plaintiffs concede, as they must, that the New Plan is facially race-neutral. In contrast, then, to the automatic application of strict scrutiny to overt racial classifications, \"when <i>facially neutral</i> legislation is subjected to equal protection attack, an inquiry into intent is necessary to determine whether the legislation in some sense was designed to accord disparate treatment on the basis of racial considerations.\" <i>Washington v. Seattle School Dist.,</i> 458 U.S. 457, 484-85, 102 S.Ct. 3187, 73 L.Ed.2d 896 (1982) (emphasis added). Although plaintiffs may also invoke strict scrutiny review by showing that the facially neutral policy is applied in a discriminatory manner, <i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins,</i> 118 U.S. 356, 373-74, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886), plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence that the New Plan is applied in a discriminatory manner, nor do we see any in the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a uniformly applied facially neutral statute, \"[d]etermining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor [in its adoption] demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.\" <i>Arlington Heights,</i> 429 U.S. at 266, 97 S.Ct. 555. The Supreme Court nonexhaustively enumerated several factors relevant to the inquiry: the degree of disproportionate racial effect, if any, of the policy; the justification, or lack thereof, for any disproportionate racial effect that may exist; and the legislative or administrative historical background of the decision. <i>Id.</i> at 266-68, 97 S.Ct. 555. We will evaluate plaintiffs' various theories supporting strict scrutiny review through the lens provided by <i>Arlington Heights,</i> although we take the factors in a different order to better track plaintiffs' arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>a. Historical background: alleged presumption of discriminatory intent</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim that because the Old Plan was unconstitutional, and the New Plan perpetuates the Old Plan's effects in violation of defendants' alleged \"duty to eliminate their duel [sic] assignment system\" of the Old Plan, we should infer that the New Plan was adopted with a discriminatory intent. To support this contention, plaintiffs quote two bedrock Supreme Court desegregation cases from the 1970s: <i>Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman,</i> 443 U.S. 526, 99 S.Ct. 2971, 61 L.Ed.2d 720 (1979) (<i>Dayton II</i>); and <i>Keyes v. School Dist.,</i> 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). The very language plaintiffs quote from these cases, as well as their significantly different facts, demonstrate the inaptness of these cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As plaintiffs point out, the <i>Keyes</i> Court held that \"there is a high probability that where school authorities have effectuated an intentionally segregative policy in a meaningful portion of the school system, similar impermissible considerations have motivated their actions in other areas of the system.\" <i>Keyes,</i> 413 U.S. at 208, 93 S.Ct. 2686. Plaintiffs quote <i>Dayton II</i> for the proposition that such a system is \"under a continuing duty to eradicate the effects of that system, and [ ] the systemwide nature of the violation furnished prima facie proof that current segregation in the [ ] schools was caused at least in part by prior intentionally segregative official acts.\" <i>Dayton II,</i> 443 U.S. at 536, 99 S.Ct. 2971 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Keyes</i> and <i>Dayton II</i> were ongoing school desegregation cases that involved purposeful discrimination by school systems attempting to avoid their affirmative obligation to undo systemic discrimination under <i>Brown v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 347 U.S. 483, 495, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (<i>Brown I</i>) (holding that the concept of \"separate but equal\" has no place in public education) and <i>Brown v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 349 U.S. 294, 301, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955) (<i>Brown II</i>) (ordering an end to segregated public education \"with all deliberate speed.\"). That was the status of the Boston school desegregation case at the time of the initial liability findings in 1974 and the remedial plan in 1976. <i>See Morgan v. Kerrigan,</i> 509 F.2d 580, 593-94 (1st Cir.1974)(relying in part on <i>Keyes</i> in upholding liability); <i>Morgan v. Kerrigan,</i> 530 F.2d 401, 425 (1st Cir.1976)(relying in part on <i>Keyes</i> in upholding the remedial plan).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case arises in a completely different context. After going through school desegregation, Boston was found in 1987 to have achieved a unitary school assignment system. <i>See Morgan,</i> 831 F.2d at 318. The defendants here acted not with the intent to maintain a system of <i>de jure</i> segregation, but with the purpose of maintaining the post-segregation unitary system. Indeed, the Old Plan, toward this end, incorporated aspects of the Boston school desegregation plan that were constitutionally compelled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Additionally, when the school committee adopted the Old Plan for the 1989 school year, the questionable constitutionality of such race-conscious efforts to minimize the tendency to resegregate was far from clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, plaintiffs would like to limit the relevant history of this case to the period following the adoption of the Old Plan. However, there is also a relevant history of <i>de jure</i> discrimination against minorities that predates 1989, as the long history of the BPS desegregation litigation shows. In consequence, the present-day Boston school system really faces two \"legacies\" &#8212; the system it administered for decades that intentionally discriminated against minorities to maintain an unequal and segregated system, and the system it administered for ten years that subjected seat assignments to racial guidelines to maintain the racial integration achieved during the intervening twelve years of court-ordered desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no gainsaying that the system still must confront the fallout from its days of over-serving what were traditionally white communities and under-serving what were traditionally minority, then mostly black, communities. As the <i>BCF IV</i> court stated: \"Any assignment plan in the Boston School system is, and will be for the foreseeable future, constrained by the mismatch between school capacity and neighborhood demand, due in part to demographic shifts, and in part to the dual system's legacy of over-serving what were historically white neighborhoods.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to adopt plaintiffs' circumscribed view of history. Likewise, we decline to find that plaintiffs have established a prima facie case of discriminatory intent in the adoption of the New Plan simply because the Old Plan was constitutionally unsound. Over forty years ago, the Supreme Court advised federal courts that context matters:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n dealing with claims under broad provisions of the Constitution, which derive content by an interpretive process of inclusion and exclusion, it is imperative that generalizations, based on and qualified by the concrete situations that gave rise to them, must not be applied out of context in disregard of variant controlling facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gomillion v. Lightfoot,</i> 364 U.S. 339, 343-44, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 (1960) (evaluating the validity of a redistricting plan under, <i>inter alia,</i> the Equal Protection Clause). Here, BPS voluntarily discontinued use of the Old Plan once it concluded that the plan was constitutionally suspect &#8212; in fact, within eight months of our decision in <i>Wessmann</i> &#8212; and replaced it with a racially neutral assignment system that was designed to maximize, not minimize, the equitable distribution of seats in the public schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that \"[b]enign intentions do not immunize government action,\" <i>Raso,</i> 135 F.3d at 16, and we do not suggest otherwise. There is no doubt that governmental policies that employ racial classifications for the distribution of benefits, or otherwise evince racial discrimination, should be subjected to strict scrutiny review. If plaintiffs could make such a showing, we would not hesitate to apply strict scrutiny to the New Plan. However, by declining to extend the reach of <i>Keyes, Dayton II,</i> and similar cases beyond their facts to create a <i>presumption</i> of racially discriminatory purpose in the adoption of the New Plan, we simply refuse to conflate vastly dissimilar cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>b.

Plaintiffs equate this commitment to racial diversity with an illegitimate commitment to racial balancing. <i>See Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 800 (noting the \"Constitution's general prohibition against racial balancing\"). To prove their point, plaintiffs cite the testimony of Superintendent Payzant elicited on cross-examination during this litigation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. So this 50% walk-to plan actually preserved the racial balance gained by the Old Plan; isn't that correct?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Right, which is precisely why I didn't want to keep 100% walk-zone preference in the New Plan after racial guidelines were withdrawn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, plaintiffs cite communications from defendants trying to convince the Racial Imbalance Advisory Council (RIAC)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and the Board of Education that after the adoption of the New Plan, BPS should still qualify for funds under the Racial Imbalance Law, M.G.L. c. 71, &#167; 37C, et seq. (RIL).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Essentially, Superintendent Payzant argued that (1) BPS qualified for funds under the Old Plan, (2) the New Plan maintained approximately the same racial balance within the schools as the Old Plan, so (3) BPS should still qualify for RIL funds, even though the New Plan lacked the explicit racial guidelines of the Old Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' reliance on selected excerpts ignores the totality of the evidence. As already noted, BPS's statistical analyses showed that, even with the elimination of the racial guidelines and a 100% walk zone preference in place, there was only a \"very, very small\" racial result. Superintendent Payzant testified at trial that BPS compared the results of a 100% walk zone preference applied both with and without the use of the racial guidelines called for in the Old Plan</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">to let the data speak for themselves and show to the Commissioner, and ultimately the State Board of Education, that the impact of the change in the student assignment plan by removing racial guidelines but keeping the other elements of the controlled choice would enable us to come very close to the same circumstances that we had that qualified us for ... meeting the standards of the Racial Imbalance Law before the policy was changed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The data are indeed telling. According to Superintendent Payzant's testimony to the Board of Education, when BPS simulated the first-round transition grade assignments for the 1999-2000 year using actual parent choices but eliminating only the use of the racial guidelines, it found that just three additional schools would have one or more transitional grades falling outside the racial guidelines. Using the parental choice data to analyze the effect on individual student placements without the use of the racial guidelines revealed that only 938 out of 13,057 (or seven percent) of students would have been assigned to different schools. About fifty-three percent of those 938 individual changed assignments would have resulted in the student being assigned to a school which she had ranked higher, and, correspondingly, forty-seven percent would have been assigned to a school which she had ranked lower. Whites, Asians, and Hispanics fared slightly better as groups, while blacks and Native Americans fared slightly worse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, BPS's analyses showed that, even after removing the racial guidelines of the Old Plan, the BPS school assignment system did not need further modification to maintain the \"racial balance\" required to be eligible for RIL funds. Although defendants were pressured by RIAC to continue explicit racial balancing, they refused to comply, despite the substantial RIL funds at stake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the Superintendent and the School Committee were also concerned about equity of choice and access across the system, particularly for students who lived in neighborhoods with inadequate capacity or underperforming schools. In his July 14, 1999 memo to the School Committee, Superintendent Payzant commented that \"it is important to note that this is not an issue of returning to neighborhood schools. That can happen in an equitable way only when new quality schools are built in neighborhoods that now have an insufficient number of schools to serve resident school age children....\" This concern is further reflected in the summary description of the New Plan provided to the Commissioner of Education as part of BPS's RIL compliance presentation. That document stated that the Superintendent and the School Committee</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">are confident that the [New Plan] continues to ensure both choice and access beyond a student's particular neighborhood in order to preserve racial and ethnic diversity and reduce the likelihood of racial isolation within its schools. In addition, the [New Plan] retains all of the educational benefits of the original Controlled Choice Student Assignment Plan, including the promotion of school improvement, continuity and stability of placement, and equitable distribution of resources and educational opportunity district-wide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' public confidence that the New Plan preserved racial diversity while advancing the other values that they identified was not an admission that the New Plan was a suspect device to achieve the numerically precise racial balancing of the Old Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to plaintiffs' arguments, the mere invocation of racial diversity as a goal is insufficient to subject the New Plan to strict scrutiny. In those cases where the Supreme Court inquired whether diversity is a compelling state interest and whether the program at issue could survive strict scrutiny, the programs were all subjected to strict scrutiny <i>because they used explicit racial classifications</i> to achieve the goal of diversity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> None of these cases, nor any other case to which our attention has been drawn, has subjected a governmental program to strict scrutiny simply because the state mentioned diversity as a goal. As the district court succinctly put it: \"Motive, in other words, is not always suspect. Means, however, may be.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 330. The Supreme Court has explained that the <i>motive</i> of increasing minority participation and access is not suspect. <i>See, e.g., City of Richmond v. JA Croson Co.,</i> 488 U.S. 469, 507, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (approving the use of race-neutral means to increase minority participation in governmental programs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We said as much in <i>Raso v. Lago,</i> 135 F.3d 11 (1998), where we considered an equal protection and &#167; 1983 challenge to a facially race-neutral policy change regarding the award of housing units that, at the end of the day, resulted in fewer white residents receiving a preference for the units to which they would have otherwise been entitled because of their prior residency. After acknowledging that the change in policy was motivated by a desire to ensure that all races had equal access to the new housing, we stated that \"plaintiffs are mistaken in treating `racial motive' as a synonym for a constitutional violation.\" <i>Raso,</i> 135 F.3d at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employing <i>de novo</i> review and placing Superintendent Payzant's cited testimony in the context of the entire record, we find that the plaintiffs have not shown that the defendants' use of the word \"diversity\" was simply a subterfuge for \"racial balancing.\" While defendants frankly acknowledged that they valued the degree of integration BPS had attained since it came under federal court order thirty years ago, their analyses using actual parental choice patterns showed that removing the racial guidelines of the Old Plan and the maintenance of a 100% walk-zone preference would not significantly erode those integration gains. BPS then resisted pressure to adhere to strict racial balancing, even with RIL funds potentially on the table, and adopted the race-neutral New Plan. To increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome on diversity and to promote \"school improvement, continuity and stability of placement, and equitable distribution of resources and educational opportunity district-wide,\" as well as the system's ongoing goals of \"excellence, equity and diversity,\" the defendants opted for the 50% walk-zone preference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court put it, Superintendent Payzant's reference to diversity \"simply restated his more convincing point that the revised assignment plan is intended to address issues of equity by giving parents in under-served neighborhoods fairer access to the school system's resources.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 332. To the extent that the School Committee's adoption of the New Plan promoted choice and equitable access to BPS resources for all students in the BPS system, as well as diversity, there is nothing in that mix of goals or the means of achieving them that triggers strict scrutiny under our own precedents or those of the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>c. Disproportionate effect</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having rejected plaintiffs' claims that the history of the New Plan's adoption, and its stated goal of diversity, require the application of strict scrutiny review, we now turn to their evidence regarding the impact of the New Plan. As we previously noted, a disproportionate racial effect of a policy can be evidence of an invidious discriminatory purpose. Although plaintiffs cite to \"individual examples of the racial effect\" of the 50% reduction in walk zone seats under the New Plan, they neither describe these examples as a \"disproportionate effect\" nor accept that any such disproportionate effect of the New Plan is relevant to establishing defendants' purportedly racially discriminatory purpose. Instead, they argue that their individual examples suffice to establish an equal protection violation. Before explaining how plaintiffs apparently misunderstand the relevant case law and their resultant evidentiary burden in this case, we first recount the evidence they presented on the racial effect of the New Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish the allegedly discriminatory effect of the New Plan's reduction of the walk zone preference from 100% to 50% of available seats, plaintiffs relied exclusively on the testimony of Ann Walsh, president of Boston's Children First.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Although Walsh testified that she reviewed admissions data from \"every school in the city,\" she only presented data for the 2002-03 admission rounds for one class in each of three schools: a pre-kindergarten program at the Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Elementary School, and two kindergarten programs at the Richard J. Murphy Elementary School and the Mary Lyon Elementary School. Walsh testified that she selected these particular schools because she \"looked for schools with white walkers who were pushed aside by the [change to a] 50% [walk zone preference], and [these three schools were] an example of that.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh prepared one-page charts for each of these schools, comparing the racial demographics of students who were admitted to the selected classes under the New Plan, with its 50% walk zone preference, to the racial demographics of students who would have been admitted if a full 100% of the seats had been reserved for students who lived within the walk zone. Walsh's testimony, and the charts she prepared for this litigation, show that in the three elementary schools &#8212; out of the 85 or so in the BPS system &#8212; a total of twenty white students who would have been admitted under a hypothetical 100% walk zone preference were not admitted under the actual 50% walk zone preference. In plaintiffs' view, with this showing of \"individual examples of the racial effect\" of the change in the walk zone preference, there was no need to engage in any systemwide analysis of the racial impact of the walk zone seat reduction. Indeed, Walsh did not attempt to project a systemwide impact from her three-school analysis. Walsh explicitly testified that she is \"opposed to the concept that the overall impact on the school system is the issue.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs erred in this minimalist approach to their evidentiary burden in this case. To be sure, the Equal Protection Clause protects individuals: \"rights created by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual. The rights established are personal rights.\" <i>Shelley v. Kraemer,</i> 334 U.S. 1, 22, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948). When a governmental policy employs overt racial classifications, the impact of race on an individual outcome is clear. As we have explained, courts will then apply strict scrutiny to determine whether the use of the racial classification is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. <i>See, e.g., Gratz v. Bollinger,</i> 539 U.S. 244, 275-76, 123 S.Ct. 2411, 156 L.Ed.2d 257 (2003). As we discuss <i>infra</i> in Part III.D., the Old Plan used explicit racial guidelines, and two plaintiffs in this case &#8212; John Feeney and Kathleen McCoy &#8212; showed that they were denied seats at their schools of choice under the Old Plan because of their race and the imposition of racial caps in force at that time. Accordingly, they were awarded nominal damages in recognition of that injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, when evaluating a facially race-neutral policy, the impact of race on an individual outcome is <i>not</i> always immediately clear. Courts can only infer that an invidious racial purpose motivated a facially neutral policy when that policy creates disproportionate racial results. \"Sometimes a clear <i>pattern,</i> unexplainable on grounds other than race, emerges from the effect of the state action even when the governing legislation appears neutral on its face.\" <i>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp.,</i> 429 U.S. 252, 266, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977) (emphasis added). <i>See also Washington v. Davis,</i> 426 U.S. 229, 242, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976) (\"an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts, including the fact, if it is true, that the law bears more heavily on one race than another.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, showing only isolated instances of students not receiving assignments at their first choice schools is insufficient. Here, there is no clear pattern of disparate racial impact, much less the \"stark\" pattern contemplated by <i>Arlington Heights. Id.</i> (\"Absent a pattern as stark as that in <i>Gomillion</i> or <i>Yick Wo,</i> impact alone is not determinative ....\") (footnotes omitted). At most, plaintiffs have established that in three schools the reduction from 100% to 50% of seats set aside for students in the walk zone resulted in twenty white students, out of the approximately 25,000 or so elementary (K-5) students in the BPS system, not being assigned to their first choice school. More relevantly, Walsh's own charts show that seven of the twenty students who actually were assigned to the disputed seats were white, meaning that the impact on whites as a group was a net loss of thirteen seats.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Isolated examples that only show a small net loss of seats to white students in selected schools is a far cry from showing that the New Plan disproportionately affects white students in the BPS system. In fact, as the district court emphasized, even with the reduction in walk zone seats, \"in the 2002-2003 school year, 80 percent of white applicants received their first choice of schools, as compared to 77 percent of black applicants.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 332.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if this showing could be characterized as evidence of a disproportionate effect, a characterization which we reject, the \"individual examples of the racial effect\" cited by plaintiffs are explainable \"on grounds other than race.\" <i>Arlington Heights,</i> 429 U.S. at 266, 97 S.Ct. 555. As the district court found, plaintiffs \"have not been able to show [ ] that the loss was due to discrimination.... Rather, as defendants point out, white students have been denied admission to certain schools, not because they were forced to compete on a non-level playing field, but because their parents have tended to over-choose these same schools.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 332. If plaintiffs had been able to show that the New Plan resulted in stark systemwide racial disparities regarding assignments to first choice schools, we might &#8212; depending on the circumstances &#8212; have reached the conclusion that intentional discrimination occurred and so adopt a stricter standard of scrutiny in assessing justification. Plaintiffs chose, however, to eschew such analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>BCF IV</i> court rightly concluded that plaintiffs' evidence fails to show any disproportionate effect of the New Policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]t was open to plaintiffs to show that the reduction in the walk zone preference has had a disproportionate impact on white children, that is, that a greater percentage of white students have found themselves shut out of their neighborhood schools. This plaintiffs have not done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 331-32. With plaintiffs having shown no racial classification at play in the New Plan, no discriminatory purpose for its adoption, and no discriminatory effect of its application, we cannot conclude that the plan \"in some sense was designed to accord disparate treatment on the basis of racial considerations.\" <i>Washington v. Seattle School Dist.,</i> 458 U.S. 457, 485, 102 S.Ct. 3187, 73 L.Ed.2d 896 (1982). Consequently, the district court correctly held that the New Plan was not subject to strict scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">3. <i>Rational Basis Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, since race-based classifications are not in play and plaintiffs failed to show that the New Plan was adopted with a discriminatory purpose, the New Plan must only survive rational basis review: as long as the plan is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest, it must be upheld. <i>See, e.g., Romer v. Evans,</i> 517 U.S. 620, 631, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996) (holding that \"if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, we will uphold the legislative classification so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have explained at some length, defendants adopted the New Plan to foster \"excellence, equity and diversity through access and educational opportunity throughout the Boston Public Schools.\" All of those goals are legitimate state interests, and the assignment process of the New Plan is rationally related to achieving them. Plaintiffs do not contend otherwise. Again, we think the district court said it well:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the School Committee has rescinded the use of any form of racial classification, direct or indirect, in the New Choice Plan, its stated objectives of preserving parental choice and opportunity, particularly for parents who would otherwise be restricted in their choice of schools, and of fostering school excellence by permitting parents to vote with their feet, satisfy the reasonableness test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs' claims that the New Plan violates their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI, or &#167;&#167; 1981 and 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">4. <i>Article 111 Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although plaintiffs argue in their opening brief to this court that the Old Plan violated Article 111 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, they only summarily state once that \"the District Court should have subjected the <i>New Plan</i> to Strict Scrutiny under Article 111,\" (emphasis added), citing to <i>Comfort ex rel. Neumyer v. Lynn School Comm.,</i> 283 F.Supp.2d 328 (D.Mass.2003) without comment. When a party includes no developed argumentation on a point, as is the case here, we treat the argument as waived under our well established rule. <i>See United States v. Bongiorno,</i> 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir.1997) (\"We have steadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by developed argumentation.\"). We make two points, however. First, in the context of arguing that the Old Plan violated Article 111, plaintiffs claim that the \"<i>Comfort</i> Court held that under Art. 111, school assignment plans that deny students an assignment to their neighborhood schools are subject to strict scrutiny....\" This misstates <i>Comfort. Comfort,</i> 283 F.Supp.2d at 366 (\"I recognize ... the need to proceed with caution. ... [A]lthough I am convinced by <i>amici</i> that intermediate scrutiny is the correct test to apply here, my analysis below will apply the more rigorous standard which the parties have briefed, strict scrutiny.\") Second, and more importantly, given our disposition of the federal claims, we would not find that the New Plan assigns students \"on the basis of race, color, national origin or creed.\" Mass. Const. amend. art. 111.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Prospective Injunctive Relief</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Injunctive relief<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> is a discretionary remedy. Thus, appellate courts typically review grants or denials of such relief only for abuse of discretion. <i>Caroline T. v. Hudson School Dist.,</i> 915 F.2d 752, 754 (1st Cir.1990). However, to the extent that the disposition of the request for an injunction turns on an issue of law, such as lack of standing or mootness, appellate courts review such determinations <i>de novo. See Langlois v. Abington Housing Authority,</i> 207 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.2000) (observing that although injunctions are typically reviewed for abuse of discretion, \"the standard of review obviously depends on the issue under consideration. Generally speaking, pure issues of law ... are reviewed <i>de novo,</i> findings of fact for clear error, and `judgment calls' with considerable deference depending upon the issue.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by dismissing their request for an injunction against BPS's future use of race because of a lack of standing, citing to <i>BCF II,</i> 98 F.Supp.2d at 117 and <i>BCF III,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d at 395, without quoting any language of the district court. Plaintiffs misread the district court's holdings. The district court in fact did not dismiss the plaintiffs' request for a prohibitory injunction for lack of standing. As it noted in its May 21, 2002 Memorandum and Order regarding this standing issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a January 25, 2002 Memorandum and Order [<i>BCF III</i>], the court found that while plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue immediate injunctive relief (given the absence of any cognizable injury), there was a strong possibility that one or more plaintiffs had standing to seek prospective relief enjoining any racially-based allocation of walk zone preferences.... Consequently, the court afforded plaintiffs an opportunity \"for further briefing of the <i>Lesage</i> issues identified in this opinion, as well as issues of a constitutional dimension raised by the School Committee's walk zone preference policy.\" [citing <i>BCF III,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d at 403.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Boston's Children First v.

The \"<i>Lesage</i> issues\" identified in this May 21 Order relate to the standing and mootness discussion in <i>BCF III,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d at 392-95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the May 21 Order, which addressed, <i>inter alia,</i> plaintiffs' standing to seek the requested prohibitory injunction, the district court explained that seven of the ten plaintiffs<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> either \"attested to having applied for year 2002-2003 admission to schools within their walk zones\" or \"attest[ed] to their intention to remain in the Boston public school system to apply for middle school assignments within their respective walk zones.\" May 21 Order at *1. The district court then concluded that \"under <i>Lesage</i> each [of the seven] has demonstrated standing to seek forward-looking relief.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, then, the district court explicitly held that seven of the plaintiffs had standing to seek an injunction prohibiting BPS from the unconstitutional use of race in future assignment systems. As can be seen from both the May 21 Order and the treatment of plaintiffs' request for forward-looking relief in <i>BCF IV,</i> which we discuss next, the district court did not dismiss this claim for want of standing. Accordingly, we can dispense with any further analysis on that ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a bench trial on the merits, the district court denied plaintiffs' requests to enjoin defendants from the future use of race and to retain jurisdiction over the assignment system. <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 333-34. Plaintiffs claim that the district court misapplied <i>City of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 283, 102 S.Ct. 1070, 71 L.Ed.2d 152 (1982) in so ruling. There was no such error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discussed <i>City of Mesquite</i> in <i>New England Regional Council of Carpenters v. Kinton,</i> 284 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.2002), where we held that when a governmental entity revised a challenged policy to remove the offending language, plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief was mooted. <i>Id.</i> at 18. Directly addressing the Supreme Court's decision in <i>City of Mesquite,</i> we explained that the Supreme Court had \"held that `a voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.'\" <i>Id.</i> (<i>quoting City of Mesquite,</i> 455 U.S. at 289, 102 S.Ct. 1070). This is precisely the <i>City of Mesquite</i> language upon which plaintiffs rely. As we made clear in <i>Kinton,</i> though, this reliance is misplaced: \"Under circuit precedent ... the <i>City of Mesquite</i> exception applies `only when there is a reasonable expectation that the challenged conduct will be repeated following dismissal of the case.'\" <i>Kinton,</i> 284 F.3d at 18 (quoting <i>D.H.L. Assocs., Inc. v. O'Gorman,</i> 199 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.1999)). There is no such reasonable expectation here. As the district court observed in <i>BCF IV:</i> \"Mere skepticism ... about the defendants' future intentions[ ] cannot justify the type of judicial intervention that plaintiffs seek.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether this ruling is characterized as one based on mootness concerns (reviewed <i>de novo</i>) or on the merits (reviewed for abuse of discretion), we find that the district court did not err in denying plaintiffs' claims for an injunction prohibiting BPS from the unconstitutional use of race in future student assignment plans. Defendants have voluntarily abandoned the unconstitutional use of race in all of its student assignment systems, and they have expressed in testimony and in letters to the Racial Imbalance Advisory Council and the Board of Education their strong desire to comply with constitutional requirements in all future assignment systems. As we have discussed <i>supra</i> in Part III.B.2.b, the defendants' commitment to diversity is not <i>per se</i> constitutionally suspect. While there is ample evidence that defendants will continue to monitor relevant school demographics and will consider modifying the current assignment system to meet all of their stated goals, including diversity, plaintiffs have been unable to show any reasonable expectation that defendants will return to unconstitutional means to achieve those goals.

Lesage,</i> 528 U.S. 18, 120 S.Ct. 467, 145 L.Ed.2d 347 (1999) (per curiam). In <i>Lesage,</i> the University of Texas denied a Caucasian applicant admission to a Ph.D. program while admitting at least one minority candidate. The parties agreed that \"the school considered the race of its applicants at some stage during the review process.\" <i>Id.</i> at 19, 120 S.Ct. 467. The University showed that \"even if the school's admissions process had been completely colorblind, Lesage would not have been admitted.\" <i>Id.</i> The Supreme Court held that if a defendant \"conclusively established that [plaintiff] would have been rejected under a race-neutral policy,\" damages are not available. <i>Id.</i> at 20, 120 S.Ct. 467. The Court could not have been clearer: \"The government can avoid liability by proving that it would have made the <i>same decision</i> without the impermissible motive.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21, 120 S.Ct. 467 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim that the \"same decision\" defense set forth in <i>Lesage</i> is not available against claims for nominal damages for constitutional violations. Plaintiffs misread <i>Lesage</i> in making this argument. <i>Lesage</i> makes no distinction among the classes of damages that become unavailable upon defendants' showing that they would have reached the same admissions result even in the absence of an unconstitutional use of race. <i>Lesage,</i> 528 U.S. at 20, 120 S.Ct. 467. <i>Lesage</i> is unambiguous:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simply put, where a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental decision as being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the government would have made the same decision regardless, there is no cognizable injury warranting relief under &#167; 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 21, 120 S.Ct. 467. <i>Lesage</i> did not limit this holding to compensatory damages or qualify the type of relief in any way, other than to mention that the case arose under &#167; 1983. There is no doubt that nominal damages are one of the forms of relief available under &#167; 1983. <i>See Farrar v. Hobby,</i> 506 U.S. 103, 112, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992) (stating that in a &#167; 1983 action, Supreme Court precedent \"obligates a court to award nominal damages when a plaintiff establishes the violation of his right to procedural due process but cannot prove actual injury.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As <i>Farrar</i> explains, where there is a deprivation of constitutional rights that do not result in an \"actual injury\" giving rise to compensatory damages, nominal damages are the appropriate remedy. <i>See also Carey v. Piphus,</i> 435 U.S. 247, 266, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978). However, <i>Lesage</i> makes clear that when the governmental entity would have made the same decision even without the impermissible consideration of race &#8212; as it did here for eight of the plaintiffs &#8212; there is no deprivation of constitutional rights at all. <i>Lesage,</i> 528 U.S. at 21, 120 S.Ct. 467. Without a deprivation of constitutional rights, liability will not attach, and damages &#8212; nominal, compensatory, or otherwise &#8212; cannot be imposed. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find no error in the district court's factual findings that the eight plaintiffs seeking nominal damages on appeal would not have been admitted to the school of their choice even if BPS had not impermissibly considered race under the Old Plan. Further, we find no error in the district court's application of <i>Lesage</i> and other relevant precedent to the plaintiffs' claims for nominal damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case comes to us in the semi-centenary year of <i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i> 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954). There, the Supreme Court described the importance of public education:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Brown,</i> 347 U.S. at 493, 74 S.Ct. 686. Given these high stakes in the access to public education, it is not surprising that this case and those that preceded it have inspired deep passions among the parties and their supporters. Indeed, in histories already written about the aftermath of <i>Brown</i> in our large cities, Boston has often been cited as a city that resisted fiercely the mandate of <i>Brown</i> and the measures required to dismantle a public school system segregated by government action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hopefully, future histories will also tell the rest of the story. Attitudes in Boston have evolved, policies have changed, institutions have reorganized. In many ways, the social fabric has been re-knit. But this healing has not lowered the stakes in public education. People of good faith, harboring only the best of intentions, can &#8212; and do &#8212; disagree about the ultimate resolution of the difficult legal and social issues that surround public education generally and school assignment systems specifically. These continuing disagreements do not diminish all that has been accomplished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we are grateful to the parties and their attorneys, as well as the amicus curiae, whose advocacy has illuminated the difficult issues before us. We also express our appreciation to the able district court judges who thoughtfully and thoroughly addressed the many complex and difficult issues in this case. The fact-finding and careful reasoning set forth in the four published opinions in this case have significantly aided our review on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED in all respects.

However, the district court found that Boston's Children First had no standing to bring suit<i>BCF III,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d at 403. This ruling was not appealed. Accordingly, Boston's Children First is not a party before this court on appeal, and we refer to the individual minors collectively as \"plaintiffs\" throughout the opinion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> From what we can glean from the record, it appears that the assignment system virtually always accommodates the sibling priority</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Because there is no dispute that the defendants are subject to Title VI, &#167; 1981, and &#167; 1983, all of plaintiffs' claims under these provisions turn on the resolution of the equal protection claim<i>See General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v.

Also, Orchard Gardens School is one of only three K-8 pilot schools, which are subject to fewer restrictions than the vast majority of non-pilot schools in the BPS system, and one of only two schools with a walk zone that crosses Attendance Zone lines.

Prompted at least in part by the lawsuit against them, the Boston School Committee, at the recommendation of Superintendent Payzant, voted to remove the racial guidelines from the assignment system on July 14, 1999. After BPS adopted a facially race-neutral assignment plan in November 1999, the plaintiffs continued to press their suit, seeking declaratory relief, several forms of injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and nominal damages. Over the course of four rulings, the district court denied all of plaintiffs' claims save one: an award of nominal damages of $1.00 each to the two students who would have been assigned to the school of their choice under the old system but for their race.

At that point, BPS adopted an assignment system known as the Controlled Choice Student Assignment Plan, (the \"Old Plan\"), which went into effect for the 1989-90 academic year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Old Plan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BPS assigns students to schools at the transition grades during students' public school careers, each of which corresponds to a student's advancement to a new type of school: kindergarten 1 (programs for 4-year-olds), kindergarten 2 (programs for five-year-olds), first grade (elementary school), sixth grade (middle school), and ninth grade (high school). While high school assignments are made on a citywide basis, Boston is divided into three Attendance Zones &#8212; the North, East, and West Zones &#8212; for purposes of the elementary and middle school assignments at issue in this case. These zones were drawn by the district court as part of its desegregation orders, and the lines largely hew to major transportation routes to keep traditional neighborhoods intact as much as possible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Students are eligible to attend any of the schools located in the Attendance Zone in which the students reside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the assignment process, students rank their preferences for the schools within their Attendance Zone, as well as for the few schools that accept students from any part of the city without regard to Attendance Zone lines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Students whose siblings attend a school receive a preference for that school during the assignment process. Similarly, students who live within the walk zone<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> of a given school receive a preference for seats at that school. Finally, every student receives a randomly assigned lottery number, with the lower numbers being considered more advantageous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Old Plan, BPS assigned students to schools using the following criteria: the student's rank preference for the school; whether a sibling already attended the school; whether the student lived within the school's walk zone; whether the student had already matriculated at the school on a temporary basis;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and, as a tie-breaker, the student's random number, with a lower random number winning out over higher numbers. Assignments under the Old Plan operated with one additional constraint &#8212; the \"ideal racial percentage\" for each grade's population, as calculated by the racial and ethnic composition of the student population in that grade within each of the three Attendance Zones. If admitting a student would cause a deviation of more than 15% from the \"ideal racial percentage,\" that student would not be admitted. The Old Plan operated largely without change for ten years, from 1989 through 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>B. Boston's Exam School Assignment System and Related \"Reverse Discrimination\" Lawsuits</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1999, the first four of what ultimately became ten individual plaintiffs, along with Boston's Children First,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> filed this lawsuit, prompted in part by the successful \"reverse discrimination\" lawsuits brought by the families of two white children who were denied admission to their choice of one of BPS's three competitive exam schools. <i>See McLaughlin v. Boston School Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2596610\"><a href=\"/opinion/2596610/mclaughlin-by-mclaughlin-v-boston-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

These exam schools admit students using a different system than that used by the other schools in the BPS system. At the time Julia McLaughlin applied to Boston Latin School, admissions were based on a combination of an applicant's grade point average and standardized test scores (collectively called the \"z-score\"), subject to a 35% minority set-aside previously imposed by the federal desegregation order and still in effect at that time. After McLaughlin filed suit and obtained a preliminary injunction admitting her to Boston Latin, BPS voluntarily discontinued use of the 35% quota, admitted students similarly situated to McLaughlin, and commissioned a consulting company to devise a new admissions policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The replacement exam school admission policy eventually adopted by BPS defined the \"qualified applicant pool\" for each exam school as the 50% of students with z-scores above the mean in any given year. Then, BPS filled half of each exam school's seats based on the students' expressed preferences for each school and their rank order z-scores. The remainder of the seats were also allocated by students' school preferences and rank order z-scores, subject to mirroring the racial composition of the remaining qualified applicant pool not yet admitted. Sarah Wessmann was denied admission to Boston Latin under the new exam school admission system, sued, and ultimately prevailed on appeal. We found the admission system unconstitutional because its use of racial classifications was not narrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest. <i>See Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 807-09.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The New Plan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based in no small part on Superintendent Payzant's frank assessment to the School Committee that, in light of <i>Wessmann</i> and other reverse discrimination lawsuits, plaintiffs in this case would almost certainly prevail in their challenge to the Old Plan, the School Committee voted on July 14, 1999, to discontinue the use of the racial classifications in the Old Plan. <i>See BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 324 n. 10. At the time of this vote, the School Committee also charged the Superintendent with developing a new student assignment plan that did not consider \"race as a factor in making student assignments\" and would also reflect \"other changes necessary to maximize access to choice, to support diversity, and promote quality education for the children of the City of Boston.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20 and November 3, 1999, the Superintendent recommended that the Old Plan be further modified in two salient ways: by reducing the percentage of available seats allocated for students within a school's walk zone from 100% to 50%, and by treating students who did not actually live within the walk zone of any school as though they had a walk-zone preference for their first or second choice school. On November 10, the School Committee adopted the Superintendent's recommendations to the Controlled Choice Student Assignment Plan with the modification that students lacking a walk-zone school would be given a walk-zone preference for both their first and second choice schools. For convenience, we refer to the modified Controlled Choice Student Assignment Plan as the \"New Plan.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the New Plan, which went into effect for the 2000-01 school year, students still rank their choice of schools and receive random numbers. Students are sorted by their school choice and ordered by their random number, with the lowest numbers put at the top of the list. BPS then computes the number of available seats at each school and sets aside 50% of those seats for students who live within the school's walk zone. The seats at each school are then filled according to the following priorities: first priority to students within the school's walk zone and with a sibling already in attendance; second priority to students outside the school's walk zone but with a sibling already in attendance; and third priority to students within the school's walk zone but with no sibling already in attendance. If there are more students in a priority tier than seats available, the seats will go to the students with the better random numbers. As students are admitted, the system updates the number of walk zone seats that are available. Once those walk zone seats are filled, a student's walk-zone status drops out of consideration and students are assigned in accordance with the school preferences by the rank of their random number.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Finally, the applications and assignments are done in rounds; if a student fails to meet the first round application deadline, she can submit her preferences in the second round, and so on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Course of Litigation Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously mentioned, four plaintiffs and Boston's Children First filed suit in federal district court on June 21, 1999, claiming that the Old Plan violated the Equal Protection Clause, which provides that no State shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\"; 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981 and 1983, which collectively prohibit deprivations of constitutional rights under color of state law; Title VI, which prohibits institutions receiving federal funds from engaging in racial discrimination; and Article 111 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, which states that \"[n]o student shall be assigned to or denied admittance to a public school on the basis of race, color, national origin or creed.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and class certification to represent all similarly situated white children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 14, 1999, the School Committee voted to discontinue the use of race in assignments. On August 10, 1999, the district court denied plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief that would have, <i>inter alia,</i> ordered BPS to cease using race or ethnicity in any phase of the school assignment process and to re-open the assignment process to students who attempted to transfer schools the previous year, as well as those entering kindergarten and first grade. <i>BCF I,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d at 262.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some time after <i>BCF I,</i> six other plaintiff children joined the suit, and plaintiffs' claims for relief expanded considerably. Plaintiffs now sought at least six forms of injunctive relief, including (1) admitting plaintiffs to their schools of choice, (2) enjoining defendants from the use of any race-based practice in all aspects of school assignments and governance, (3) requiring all students in the BPS system to reapply under the terms of the New Plan, (4) dismantling the Attendance Zones, (5) granting Boston's Children First access to BPS records to monitor compliance, and (6) retaining jurisdiction in federal court for three years to monitor compliance. Plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief stating that the New Plan violated their rights under the relevant federal and state laws, nominal damages for all plaintiffs, and compensatory damages for five plaintiffs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> On October 29, BPS moved to dismiss plaintiffs' claims, arguing that the suit was moot in light of its voluntary discontinuance of the Old Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 19, 2000, the <i>BCF II</i> court ruled that all of these claims survived defendants' motion to dismiss, with one exception. Finding that five \"of the plaintiffs did not seek assignments in the 1999-2000 school year and have not indicated any present intention to seek an assignment in the 2000-01 school year,\" the district court held that \"injunctive relief is unnecessary to redress the injuries of these [five] plaintiffs as they have not indicated that they will even participate in the future school assignment plan.\" <i>BCF II,</i> 98 F.Supp.2d at 117. Accordingly, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss in so far as it related to the injunctive relief of those five plaintiffs,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and otherwise denied the motion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>BCF III,</i> the court disposed of additional claims. First, the court dismissed as moot the remaining five plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief admitting them to their school of choice because three plaintiffs (Sharaffa, O'Toole, and Feeney) left the BPS system prior to the 2001 admissions season, and the final two plaintiffs (Higgins and Thomas Stoddard) chose to remain at their current schools. <i>BCF III,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d at 395. Second, the court rejected plaintiffs' claims that the three Attendance Zones were \"racially gerrymandered,\" explaining that \"[b]ecause the zones today, whatever role race may have played in their creation, serve administrative, rather than racial balancing purposes, I conclude that no viable `case or controversy' exists regarding their current configuration.\" <i>Id.</i> at 397-99. This holding disposed of both the injunctive request related to dismantling the Attendance Zones and the declaratory relief request to the extent that it rested on the allegedly racial purpose of the Attendance Zones. Third, the court denied plaintiffs' request for an injunction requiring every student in the BPS system to reapply under the New Plan, explaining that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">even if a showing could be made that one or more of the plaintiffs might derive an advantage from a system-wide reprocessing of all student assignments, any benefit conferred would be outweighed by the consequent demoralization of a school system that has yet to fully absorb the effects of a quarter-century effort to bring itself into compliance with court-ordered desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 401. Fourth, the court held that Boston's Children First lacked standing as an organizational plaintiff to press the lawsuit. <i>Id.</i> at 403. The <i>BCF III</i> court reserved all of the other claims in the suit pending further discovery, briefing, and trial. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a bench trial on the merits, the district court issued a ruling in <i>BCF IV</i> on April 23, 2003. The <i>BCF IV</i> court found that (1) the New Plan, with its change in the walk zone preference from 100% to 50% of seats, was facially race-neutral, (2) there was no evidence that the policy was applied in a discriminatory manner, and (3) plaintiffs did not show that the policy was adopted with a discriminatory intention and applied in a way that had a discriminatory effect. <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 331-32. Accordingly, the district court declined to apply strict scrutiny to the New Plan. <i>Id.</i> at 333. Instead, it evaluated the New Plan under rational basis review and found that it \"satisf[ied] the reasonableness test.\" <i>Id.</i> The court also held that plaintiffs' \"[m]ere skepticism ... about the defendants' future intentions[ ] cannot justify\" an injunction prohibiting the school system from using race as a factor in the assignment system in the future. In consequence, the court entered judgment for defendants, <i>id.</i> at 334, and noted that it would address the bifurcated claims for nominal damages separately. <i>Id.</i> at n. 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 27, 2003, the court issued a short memorandum and order awarding nominal damages of $1.00 each to Feeney and McCoy because, as BPS admitted, those plaintiffs \"were denied seat assignments at their preferred schools because of their race\" under the Old Plan. <i>Boston's Children First v. Boston School Comm.,</i> No. 99-11330-RGS (D.Mass. May 27, 2003) (unpublished) (<i>\"BCF V\"</i>).

Although we find some confusion in the record and the briefs over both the exact nature of the relief sought on appeal and whether certain claims for injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs were dismissed for mootness or lack of standing, or instead resolved on the merits, we ultimately understand that plaintiffs seek three forms of relief on appeal. First, plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the New Plan is unconstitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Second, plaintiffs seek an injunction prohibiting BPS from using race in any way in a modified school assignment system.

Plaintiffs present several arguments that strict scrutiny applies, including that the unconstitutionality of the Old Plan<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> requires a presumption that the New Plan is unconstitutional and that the defendants' stated goal of diversity requires a finding that the New Plan is unconstitutional. Even if those arguments fail, plaintiffs contend, the New Plan has a discriminatory effect from which a discriminatory intent can be inferred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1. <i>Adoption of the New Plan</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When designing and choosing among methods for assigning students to schools, school boards seek to promote certain values and policies, and they operate within certain historical, political, financial, and legal constraints. Defendants in this case are no exception. As they considered the adoption of the New Plan in 1999, they saw a system burdened with a significant inequity in the number of walk zone schools available to students in different parts of the city. For example, while about 30% of elementary school students had only one to three walk zone choices, approximately 37% had six to ten. In fact, when the New Plan was adopted in November 1999, 1772 students were not within the walk zone of any school. Furthermore, at the neighborhood level, some areas of the city had an excess capacity of school seats compared to the number of school-age children, while other areas faced significant shortages. For example, Roxbury and South Dorchester both faced shortages of around 2500 seats, while Jamaica Plain and Allston/Brighton collectively had excess capacity of around 1600 seats. Additionally, some schools in significant demand were over-chosen by parents and students, while others lacked enough applicants to fill the available seats. In the East Zone, where plaintiffs reside, Everett Elementary had 7.3 applicants for each available seat for the 2002-03 academic year, while Lee Elementary had just 0.6 applicants for each available seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantial disparities among the Boston neighborhoods regarding school quality and capacity, numbers of resident students, and walk zone choices were significant considerations in the adoption of the New Plan and its reduction of the walk zone preference to 50% of the seats. Additionally, BPS compiled statistics showing that of the parents and students ranking their school choices, approximately 50% chose a walk zone school as their first choice, while the other 50% chose as their first choice a school whose walk zone did not include the student.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BPS also had been concerned about the potentially resegregative impact of removing the racial guidelines of the Old Plan and simultaneously leaving the 100% walk zone preference in place. Apparently, though, BPS's analysis allayed those concerns, showing that there would be little immediate resegregative effect of removing the racial guidelines. Superintendent Payzant explained to the Massachusetts Board of Education that when the School Committee was considering changes to the Old Plan, BPS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">did some simulations to see what the impact would be as a result of removing race from the plan, and based on the data we had to work with at the time, ... the result of removing race was really very, very small. In fact, we found out we only had three additional schools that would not meet the racial guidelines in one or more grades....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the immediate racial impact of removing the racial guidelines would be \"very small,\" BPS was still concerned about the impact on access and choice that would flow from a 100% walk zone preference. Accordingly, BPS simulated the results of leaving the walk zone preference at 100%, reducing it to 75%, and reducing it to 50%. Ultimately, Superintendent Payzant recommended the 50% reduction in an October 20, 1999, memo to the School Committee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>RATIONALE</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One hundred percent walk zone preference in a controlled choice plan without racial guidelines could result in all available seats being assigned to students within the walk zone. The result would limit choice and access for all students, including those who have no walk zone or live in walk zones where there are insufficient seats to serve the students residing in the walk zone....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until more neighborhoods without schools or with insufficient numbers of schools have [more schools], [a] one hundred percent walk zone preference would limit choice and access for too many families to the schools they want their children to attend. On the other hand, the policy also should and does recognize the interests of families who want to choose a walk zone school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Superintendent Payzant concluded the memo by stating that a 50% walk zone preference \"provides a fair balance and enables the School Committee to establish a policy which will result in progress in meeting the goal[s] of excellence, equity and diversity through access and educational opportunity throughout the Boston Public Schools.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence supports the conclusion that the racial impact of removing the racial guidelines was not significant, and the School Committee adopted the 50% reduction in walk-zone seats primarily because they were concerned about limited choice and equity for students with an insufficient number of walk-zone schools. Additionally, Superintendent Payzant and the School Committee concluded that the 50% reduction was consistent with progress towards BPS's existing goals of excellence, equity, and diversity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. <i>Applicability of Strict Scrutiny Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of race.\" <i>Washington v.

After going through school desegregation, Boston was found in 1987 to have achieved a unitary school assignment system. <i>See Morgan,</i> 831 F.2d at 318. The defendants here acted not with the intent to maintain a system of <i>de jure</i> segregation, but with the purpose of maintaining the post-segregation unitary system. Indeed, the Old Plan, toward this end, incorporated aspects of the Boston school desegregation plan that were constitutionally compelled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Additionally, when the school committee adopted the Old Plan for the 1989 school year, the questionable constitutionality of such race-conscious efforts to minimize the tendency to resegregate was far from clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, plaintiffs would like to limit the relevant history of this case to the period following the adoption of the Old Plan. However, there is also a relevant history of <i>de jure</i> discrimination against minorities that predates 1989, as the long history of the BPS desegregation litigation shows. In consequence, the present-day Boston school system really faces two \"legacies\" &#8212; the system it administered for decades that intentionally discriminated against minorities to maintain an unequal and segregated system, and the system it administered for ten years that subjected seat assignments to racial guidelines to maintain the racial integration achieved during the intervening twelve years of court-ordered desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no gainsaying that the system still must confront the fallout from its days of over-serving what were traditionally white communities and under-serving what were traditionally minority, then mostly black, communities. As the <i>BCF IV</i> court stated: \"Any assignment plan in the Boston School system is, and will be for the foreseeable future, constrained by the mismatch between school capacity and neighborhood demand, due in part to demographic shifts, and in part to the dual system's legacy of over-serving what were historically white neighborhoods.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to adopt plaintiffs' circumscribed view of history.

Here, BPS voluntarily discontinued use of the Old Plan once it concluded that the plan was constitutionally suspect &#8212; in fact, within eight months of our decision in <i>Wessmann</i> &#8212; and replaced it with a racially neutral assignment system that was designed to maximize, not minimize, the equitable distribution of seats in the public schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that \"[b]enign intentions do not immunize government action,\" <i>Raso,</i> 135 F.3d at 16, and we do not suggest otherwise.

If plaintiffs could make such a showing, we would not hesitate to apply strict scrutiny to the New Plan.

Plaintiffs equate this commitment to racial diversity with an illegitimate commitment to racial balancing. <i>See Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 800 (noting the \"Constitution's general prohibition against racial balancing\"). To prove their point, plaintiffs cite the testimony of Superintendent Payzant elicited on cross-examination during this litigation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.

Right, which is precisely why I didn't want to keep 100% walk-zone preference in the New Plan after racial guidelines were withdrawn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, plaintiffs cite communications from defendants trying to convince the Racial Imbalance Advisory Council (RIAC)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and the Board of Education that after the adoption of the New Plan, BPS should still qualify for funds under the Racial Imbalance Law, M.G.L. c. 71, &#167; 37C, et seq. (RIL).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Essentially, Superintendent Payzant argued that (1) BPS qualified for funds under the Old Plan, (2) the New Plan maintained approximately the same racial balance within the schools as the Old Plan, so (3) BPS should still qualify for RIL funds, even though the New Plan lacked the explicit racial guidelines of the Old Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' reliance on selected excerpts ignores the totality of the evidence. As already noted, BPS's statistical analyses showed that, even with the elimination of the racial guidelines and a 100% walk zone preference in place, there was only a \"very, very small\" racial result. Superintendent Payzant testified at trial that BPS compared the results of a 100% walk zone preference applied both with and without the use of the racial guidelines called for in the Old Plan</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">to let the data speak for themselves and show to the Commissioner, and ultimately the State Board of Education, that the impact of the change in the student assignment plan by removing racial guidelines but keeping the other elements of the controlled choice would enable us to come very close to the same circumstances that we had that qualified us for ... meeting the standards of the Racial Imbalance Law before the policy was changed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The data are indeed telling. According to Superintendent Payzant's testimony to the Board of Education, when BPS simulated the first-round transition grade assignments for the 1999-2000 year using actual parent choices but eliminating only the use of the racial guidelines, it found that just three additional schools would have one or more transitional grades falling outside the racial guidelines. Using the parental choice data to analyze the effect on individual student placements without the use of the racial guidelines revealed that only 938 out of 13,057 (or seven percent) of students would have been assigned to different schools. About fifty-three percent of those 938 individual changed assignments would have resulted in the student being assigned to a school which she had ranked higher, and, correspondingly, forty-seven percent would have been assigned to a school which she had ranked lower. Whites, Asians, and Hispanics fared slightly better as groups, while blacks and Native Americans fared slightly worse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, BPS's analyses showed that, even after removing the racial guidelines of the Old Plan, the BPS school assignment system did not need further modification to maintain the \"racial balance\" required to be eligible for RIL funds. Although defendants were pressured by RIAC to continue explicit racial balancing, they refused to comply, despite the substantial RIL funds at stake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the Superintendent and the School Committee were also concerned about equity of choice and access across the system, particularly for students who lived in neighborhoods with inadequate capacity or underperforming schools. In his July 14, 1999 memo to the School Committee, Superintendent Payzant commented that \"it is important to note that this is not an issue of returning to neighborhood schools. That can happen in an equitable way only when new quality schools are built in neighborhoods that now have an insufficient number of schools to serve resident school age children....\" This concern is further reflected in the summary description of the New Plan provided to the Commissioner of Education as part of BPS's RIL compliance presentation. That document stated that the Superintendent and the School Committee</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">are confident that the [New Plan] continues to ensure both choice and access beyond a student's particular neighborhood in order to preserve racial and ethnic diversity and reduce the likelihood of racial isolation within its schools. In addition, the [New Plan] retains all of the educational benefits of the original Controlled Choice Student Assignment Plan, including the promotion of school improvement, continuity and stability of placement, and equitable distribution of resources and educational opportunity district-wide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' public confidence that the New Plan preserved racial diversity while advancing the other values that they identified was not an admission that the New Plan was a suspect device to achieve the numerically precise racial balancing of the Old Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to plaintiffs' arguments, the mere invocation of racial diversity as a goal is insufficient to subject the New Plan to strict scrutiny. In those cases where the Supreme Court inquired whether diversity is a compelling state interest and whether the program at issue could survive strict scrutiny, the programs were all subjected to strict scrutiny <i>because they used explicit racial classifications</i> to achieve the goal of diversity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> None of these cases, nor any other case to which our attention has been drawn, has subjected a governmental program to strict scrutiny simply because the state mentioned diversity as a goal. As the district court succinctly put it: \"Motive, in other words, is not always suspect. Means, however, may be.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 330. The Supreme Court has explained that the <i>motive</i> of increasing minority participation and access is not suspect. <i>See, e.g., City of Richmond v.

After acknowledging that the change in policy was motivated by a desire to ensure that all races had equal access to the new housing, we stated that \"plaintiffs are mistaken in treating `racial motive' as a synonym for a constitutional violation.\" <i>Raso,</i> 135 F.3d at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employing <i>de novo</i> review and placing Superintendent Payzant's cited testimony in the context of the entire record, we find that the plaintiffs have not shown that the defendants' use of the word \"diversity\" was simply a subterfuge for \"racial balancing.\" While defendants frankly acknowledged that they valued the degree of integration BPS had attained since it came under federal court order thirty years ago, their analyses using actual parental choice patterns showed that removing the racial guidelines of the Old Plan and the maintenance of a 100% walk-zone preference would not significantly erode those integration gains. BPS then resisted pressure to adhere to strict racial balancing, even with RIL funds potentially on the table, and adopted the race-neutral New Plan. To increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome on diversity and to promote \"school improvement, continuity and stability of placement, and equitable distribution of resources and educational opportunity district-wide,\" as well as the system's ongoing goals of \"excellence, equity and diversity,\" the defendants opted for the 50% walk-zone preference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court put it, Superintendent Payzant's reference to diversity \"simply restated his more convincing point that the revised assignment plan is intended to address issues of equity by giving parents in under-served neighborhoods fairer access to the school system's resources.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 332. To the extent that the School Committee's adoption of the New Plan promoted choice and equitable access to BPS resources for all students in the BPS system, as well as diversity, there is nothing in that mix of goals or the means of achieving them that triggers strict scrutiny under our own precedents or those of the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>c.

As we previously noted, a disproportionate racial effect of a policy can be evidence of an invidious discriminatory purpose. Although plaintiffs cite to \"individual examples of the racial effect\" of the 50% reduction in walk zone seats under the New Plan, they neither describe these examples as a \"disproportionate effect\" nor accept that any such disproportionate effect of the New Plan is relevant to establishing defendants' purportedly racially discriminatory purpose. Instead, they argue that their individual examples suffice to establish an equal protection violation. Before explaining how plaintiffs apparently misunderstand the relevant case law and their resultant evidentiary burden in this case, we first recount the evidence they presented on the racial effect of the New Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish the allegedly discriminatory effect of the New Plan's reduction of the walk zone preference from 100% to 50% of available seats, plaintiffs relied exclusively on the testimony of Ann Walsh, president of Boston's Children First.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Although Walsh testified that she reviewed admissions data from \"every school in the city,\" she only presented data for the 2002-03 admission rounds for one class in each of three schools: a pre-kindergarten program at the Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Elementary School, and two kindergarten programs at the Richard J. Murphy Elementary School and the Mary Lyon Elementary School. Walsh testified that she selected these particular schools because she \"looked for schools with white walkers who were pushed aside by the [change to a] 50% [walk zone preference], and [these three schools were] an example of that.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh prepared one-page charts for each of these schools, comparing the racial demographics of students who were admitted to the selected classes under the New Plan, with its 50% walk zone preference, to the racial demographics of students who would have been admitted if a full 100% of the seats had been reserved for students who lived within the walk zone. Walsh's testimony, and the charts she prepared for this litigation, show that in the three elementary schools &#8212; out of the 85 or so in the BPS system &#8212; a total of twenty white students who would have been admitted under a hypothetical 100% walk zone preference were not admitted under the actual 50% walk zone preference. In plaintiffs' view, with this showing of \"individual examples of the racial effect\" of the change in the walk zone preference, there was no need to engage in any systemwide analysis of the racial impact of the walk zone seat reduction. Indeed, Walsh did not attempt to project a systemwide impact from her three-school analysis. Walsh explicitly testified that she is \"opposed to the concept that the overall impact on the school system is the issue.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs erred in this minimalist approach to their evidentiary burden in this case. To be sure, the Equal Protection Clause protects individuals: \"rights created by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual. The rights established are personal rights.\" <i>Shelley v. Kraemer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104545\"><a href=\"/opinion/104545/shelley-v-kraemer/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 22, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104545\"><a href=\"/opinion/104545/shelley-v-kraemer/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As we have explained, courts will then apply strict scrutiny to determine whether the use of the racial classification is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. <i>See, e.g., Gratz v.

As we discuss <i>infra</i> in Part III.D., the Old Plan used explicit racial guidelines, and two plaintiffs in this case &#8212; John Feeney and Kathleen McCoy &#8212; showed that they were denied seats at their schools of choice under the Old Plan because of their race and the imposition of racial caps in force at that time.

Id.</i> (\"Absent a pattern as stark as that in <i>Gomillion</i> or <i>Yick Wo,</i> impact alone is not determinative ....\") (footnotes omitted). At most, plaintiffs have established that in three schools the reduction from 100% to 50% of seats set aside for students in the walk zone resulted in twenty white students, out of the approximately 25,000 or so elementary (K-5) students in the BPS system, not being assigned to their first choice school. More relevantly, Walsh's own charts show that seven of the twenty students who actually were assigned to the disputed seats were white, meaning that the impact on whites as a group was a net loss of thirteen seats.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Isolated examples that only show a small net loss of seats to white students in selected schools is a far cry from showing that the New Plan disproportionately affects white students in the BPS system. In fact, as the district court emphasized, even with the reduction in walk zone seats, \"in the 2002-2003 school year, 80 percent of white applicants received their first choice of schools, as compared to 77 percent of black applicants.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 332.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if this showing could be characterized as evidence of a disproportionate effect, a characterization which we reject, the \"individual examples of the racial effect\" cited by plaintiffs are explainable \"on grounds other than race.\" <i>Arlington Heights,</i> 429 U.S. at 266, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109573\"><a href=\"/opinion/109573/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Consequently, the court afforded plaintiffs an opportunity \"for further briefing of the <i>Lesage</i> issues identified in this opinion, as well as issues of a constitutional dimension raised by the School Committee's walk zone preference policy.\" [citing <i>BCF III,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d at 403.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Boston's Children First v.

As can be seen from both the May 21 Order and the treatment of plaintiffs' request for forward-looking relief in <i>BCF IV,</i> which we discuss next, the district court did not dismiss this claim for want of standing.

Directly addressing the Supreme Court's decision in <i>City of Mesquite,</i> we explained that the Supreme Court had \"held that `a voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.'\" <i>Id.</i> (<i>quoting City of Mesquite,</i> 455 U.S. at 289, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110649\"><a href=\"/opinion/110649/city-of-mesquite-v-aladdins-castle-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></a></span>). This is precisely the <i>City of Mesquite</i> language upon which plaintiffs rely. As we made clear in <i>Kinton,</i> though, this reliance is misplaced: \"Under circuit precedent ... the <i>City of Mesquite</i> exception applies `only when there is a reasonable expectation that the challenged conduct will be repeated following dismissal of the case.'\" <i>Kinton,</i> 284 F.3d at 18 (quoting <i>D.H.L.

There is no such reasonable expectation here. As the district court observed in <i>BCF IV:</i> \"Mere skepticism ... about the defendants' future intentions[ ] cannot justify the type of judicial intervention that plaintiffs seek.\" <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether this ruling is characterized as one based on mootness concerns (reviewed <i>de novo</i>) or on the merits (reviewed for abuse of discretion), we find that the district court did not err in denying plaintiffs' claims for an injunction prohibiting BPS from the unconstitutional use of race in future student assignment plans. Defendants have voluntarily abandoned the unconstitutional use of race in all of its student assignment systems, and they have expressed in testimony and in letters to the Racial Imbalance Advisory Council and the Board of Education their strong desire to comply with constitutional requirements in all future assignment systems. As we have discussed <i>supra</i> in Part III.B.2.b, the defendants' commitment to diversity is not <i>per se</i> constitutionally suspect. While there is ample evidence that defendants will continue to monitor relevant school demographics and will consider modifying the current assignment system to meet all of their stated goals, including diversity, plaintiffs have been unable to show any reasonable expectation that defendants will return to unconstitutional means to achieve those goals. Accordingly, we see no reason to overturn the district court's denial of the requested prohibitory injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span> (1999) (per curiam). In <i>Lesage,</i> the University of Texas denied a Caucasian applicant admission to a Ph.D. program while admitting at least one minority candidate.

The University showed that \"even if the school's admissions process had been completely colorblind, Lesage would not have been admitted.\" <i>Id.</i> The Supreme Court held that if a defendant \"conclusively established that [plaintiff] would have been rejected under a race-neutral policy,\" damages are not available. <i>Id.</i> at 20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1854808\"><a href=\"/opinion/1854808/texas-v-lesage/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Plaintiffs misread <i>Lesage</i> in making this argument. <i>Lesage</i> makes no distinction among the classes of damages that become unavailable upon defendants' showing that they would have reached the same admissions result even in the absence of an unconstitutional use of race. <i>Lesage,</i> 528 U.S. at 20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1854808\"><a href=\"/opinion/1854808/texas-v-lesage/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There is no doubt that nominal damages are one of the forms of relief available under &#167; 1983. <i>See Farrar v.

However, <i>Lesage</i> makes clear that when the governmental entity would have made the same decision even without the impermissible consideration of race &#8212; as it did here for eight of the plaintiffs &#8212; there is no deprivation of constitutional rights at all. <i>Lesage,</i> 528 U.S. at 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1854808\"><a href=\"/opinion/1854808/texas-v-lesage/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Further, we find no error in the district court's application of <i>Lesage</i> and other relevant precedent to the plaintiffs' claims for nominal damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case comes to us in the semi-centenary year of <i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There, the Supreme Court described the importance of public education:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Brown,</i> 347 U.S. at 493, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span>. Given these high stakes in the access to public education, it is not surprising that this case and those that preceded it have inspired deep passions among the parties and their supporters. Indeed, in histories already written about the aftermath of <i>Brown</i> in our large cities, Boston has often been cited as a city that resisted fiercely the mandate of <i>Brown</i> and the measures required to dismantle a public school system segregated by government action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hopefully, future histories will also tell the rest of the story. Attitudes in Boston have evolved, policies have changed, institutions have reorganized. In many ways, the social fabric has been re-knit.
