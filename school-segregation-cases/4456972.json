(“ESG”) provides\n\nthe following response to the Brief of Cross-Appellants RLJ II-C Austin Air, LP,\n\nRLJ II-C Austin Air Lessee, LP, and RLJ Lodging Fund II Acquisitions, LLC\n\n(collectively, “RLJ”):\n\n\n\n\n                                        1                              895484   402/122\n\f                           STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL FACTS\n\n       RLJ’s statement of facts and issues on appeal attempt to show allocation of\n\ndamages on appeal despite the fact that RLJ presented no such evidence to the\n\ntrial court. RLJ’s complaint alleged indivisible damages as follows:\n\n               As a direct, natural, probable, and foreseeable\n               consequence associated with breaches of contract by\n               EBCO, ESG, Swenson, HBC, Swoboda, and Terracon,\n               Plaintiffs have sustained damages for which they sue\n               herein.\n               ...\n\n               As a result of the breaches of contract, breach of\n               fiduciary duties, breach of warranty, tort/negligence\n               breaches, and negligent acts alleged above, Plaintiffs\n               have sustained damages in excess of the minimal\n               jurisdictional requirements of this court. The appropriate\n               measure of damages for the breach of contract and breach\n               of warranty claims is the difference in value between the\n               building as constructed, and the value of the building had\n               it been designed and constructed pursuant to the\n               respective contracts. In the alternative, the measure of\n               damages is the cost to fully and completely repair the\n               Project.\n\nCR:195; 200-01 (¶¶49, 73) (emphasis added).1                     RLJ did not allocate or\n\ndifferentiate between the alleged damages caused by ESG and those of the settling\n\nparties at issue, Terracon Consultants, Inc. (“Terracon”) and EBCO General\n\nContractor, Ltd., EBCO Advanced Building Systems, Ltd., and EBCO Warrior\n\nManagement LLC (collectively “EBCO”). CR:195; 200-02. Confirming this fact,\n\n1\n ESG adopts the format for citation to the record identified on pages 1-2, notes 1 and 3 of RLJ’s\nBrief.\n                                                2                                 895484.2   402/122\n\fRLJ sought “judgment against the Defendants, jointly and severally, for their\n\ndamages.” CR:202.\n\n      At trial, counsel for ESG asked RLJ’s expert witness on market value\n\ndamages if he had allocated any damages to any particular party’s breach or\n\nconduct. RR:V.7, 159:8-20. RLJ’s witness stated that he was unable to allocate or\n\n“parse out” any damages to any particular party. Id. RLJ’s appellate brief admits\n\nit did not present evidence of allocation of damages, stating “RLJ was not given\n\nthe opportunity to segregate or apportion damages to satisfy the trial court’s\n\nreasoning before the case was submitted to the jury.” RLJ Brief at 13, n.4. The\n\nrecord does not contain any request from RLJ to the trial court for an “opportunity”\n\nto present evidence segregating or apportioning its damages.\n\n      After the jury issued its verdict, ESG presented evidence that the damages\n\naward contained indivisible damages by referencing RLJ’s complaint. CR:1173-\n\n1178. ESG also submitted RLJ’s settlement agreements with Terracon and EBCO,\n\nwhich did not allocate damages to any particular claim. CR:1461-1488. RLJ\n\nagreed to release EBCO from the following:\n\n            any and all actions, causes of actions, claims, demands,\n            costs, loss of services, expenses, and compensation on\n            account of or in any way growing out of any known and\n            unknown damages which Releasors may now or hereafter\n            have against Releasees resulting, existing or alleged to\n            result from, related to or arising out of, the Project, the\n            Contract, repair/remediation of the Project, allegations\n            asserted against Releasees described in any of\n                                         3                            895484.2   402/122\n\f             Releasors’ pleadings filed in the above-referenced\n             lawsuit, involving any services, work or materials\n             provided by Releasees, or any claim(s) against\n             Releasees involving the Project.\n\nCR:1468-69 (emphasis added). Likewise, RLJ agreed to release Terracon from the\n\nfollowing:\n\n             all Claims and Causes of Action arising out of or relating\n             to the Occurrence in Question as defined above,\n             including but not limited to, all Claims and Causes of\n             Action which have been asserted, could have been\n             asserted, or may accrue in the future or otherwise become\n             known to Releasor as claims that could be asserted\n             against the Released Parties by Releasor based upon the\n             Occurrence in Question.\n\nCR:1479. The “Occurrence in Question” is defined to include the allegations in\n\nRLJ’s petition. CR:1477. ESG’s evidence of common damages and indivisible\n\ninjury shifted the burden to RLJ to provide evidence of allocation of damages.\n\nCR:1173-78.    RLJ did not provide any allocation evidence and subsequently\n\nadmitted in pleadings to the trial court that RLJ’s injuries in this case are\n\n“indivisible.” CR:1266 (“In a case involving indivisible injury, such as this . . .”)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      Based on RLJ’s pleadings and evidence at trial, the trial court properly\n\nentered a judgment applying the full amounts of the EBCO and Terracon\n\nsettlements to the jury’s verdict. CR:1437-41; 1708-12.\n\n\n\n\n                                         4                             895484.2   402/122\n\f                          SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      A plaintiff cannot recover twice for the same injury. This is not a new or\n\nnovel principle of law—case law in Texas applying this principle dates back to the\n\n1800s. Presumably seeking to maximize their recovery in this case, RLJ pled and\n\nrepeatedly emphasized that their alleged injuries (foundation damage) and alleged\n\nmonetary damages were indivisible and sought to recover all of their damages\n\njointly and severally from all defendants. Because RLJ alleged that each defendant\n\ncaused the same injury and damage, the trial court properly applied RLJ’s\n\nsettlements as credits against the jury’s verdict.   Absent evidence that RLJ’s\n\nsettlements applied to damages solely caused by parties other than ESG, which\n\nRLJ admits does not exist, Texas law requires full application of the settlement\n\ncredits to avoid double recovery.\n\n                                    ARGUMENT\n\nI.     Standard of review\n\n      The trial court’s determination regarding the amount of the settlement credit\n\nis reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See Oyster Creek Fin. Corp. v. Richwood\n\nInvs. II, Inc., 176 S.W.3d 307, 328 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet.\n\ndenied); Texas Cap. Sec. Inc. v. Sandefer, 108 S.W.3d 923, 925 (Tex. App.—\n\nTexarkana 2003, pet. denied). The test for abuse of discretion is whether the court\n\nacted without reference to any guiding rules and principles or, stated another way,\n\n\n                                        5                            895484.2   402/122\n\fwhether its decision was arbitrary or unreasonable. City of San Benito v. Rio\n\nGrande Valley Gas Co., 109 S.W.3d 750, 757 (Tex. 2003). Weighing the evidence\n\nwith respect to the amount of the settlement credit involves the exercise of the trial\n\ncourt’s discretion, and the trial court will not be held to have abused its discretion\n\nif some evidence reasonably supports its decision. Utts v. Short, No. 03-03-00512,\n\n2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 2874, at *10-11 (Tex. App.—Austin Apr. 1, 2004, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\nII.    Texas law does not require joint and several liability for application of\n       the one-satisfaction rule. (Issue No. A.1)\n\n       RLJ has scant authority for its position that the one-satisfaction rule does not\n\napply in this case. Attempting to craft an argument where precedent does not exist,\n\nRLJ argues that the one-satisfaction rule was created only to apply to contribution\n\nclaims and never intended to apply outside of tort claims. RLJ Brief at 19-21. To\n\nthe contrary, the Texas Supreme Court began enforcing the one-satisfaction rule as\n\nearly as 1856, with the only requisite being that the claimant may not recover twice\n\nfor the same injury. 2 The Supreme Court has explained that Texas’ statutory\n\ncontribution scheme for tort claims upholds the broader one-satisfaction rule. Utts\n\n2\n  Lewis v. Taylor, 17 Tex. 57 (Tex. 1856) (“in an action or actions against several persons for the\nsame trespass, the plaintiff can have judgment separately against each of them, and separate\nexecutions; but he can have but one satisfaction”); Andrews v. Harvey, 39 Tex. 123 (Tex. 1873)\n(“The liability of the appellant and McGrew may exist at the same time, although there can be\nbut one satisfaction”); Alvord v. Waggoner, 32 S.W. 872, 873 (Tex. 1895) (“Alvord had the\nright to sue Fosdick or Eustis upon the warranties contained in these deeds, or he might have\nsued each of them, but he could have but one satisfaction of his damages.”) (emphasis added in\neach).\n                                                6                                  895484.2   402/122\n\fv. Short, 81 S.W.3d 822, 831-32 (Tex. 2002). The Supreme Court in Utts did not\n\nfind that Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapter 33 supersedes the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule—it complements the one-satisfaction rule. Id. As the recent\n\nTexas precedent discussed below reveals, the one-satisfaction rule applies to any\n\nand all claims and simply holds that a party may not recover for the same injury\n\ntwice.\n\n         RLJ seeks to inhibit the simple application of the one-satisfaction rule by\n\nintroducing a new requirement—joint and several liability. RLJ’s description of\n\njoint and several tort liability and Texas’ statutory contribution scheme is a straw\n\nman intended to deflect attention from Texas’ common law one-satisfaction rule.\n\nRLJ Brief at 21-22. The authority contrary to RLJ’s position is overwhelming—\n\nneither this Court nor any other appellate jurisdiction in Texas holds that the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule is limited by the particular cause of action asserted by the plaintiff:\n\n               Galle, Inc. v. Pool, 262 S.W.3d 564, 573 (Tex. App.—\n               Austin 2008, pet. denied) (“if the plaintiff has suffered\n               only one injury, even if based on ‘overlapping and\n               varied theories of liability,’ the plaintiff may only\n               recover once”) (emphasis added);\n               Osborne v. Jauregui, Inc., 252 S.W.3d 70, 75 (Tex.\n               App.—Austin 2008, pet. denied) (en banc) (application\n               of the one-satisfaction rule “is not limited to tort claims,\n               and whether the rule may be applied depends not on the\n               cause of action asserted but rather the injury sustained”)\n               (emphasis added);\n\n\n\n                                            7                              895484.2   402/122\n\fMetal Bldg.

Pool is directly on point and holds that\n\nthe application of the one-satisfaction rule “is not limited to tort claims, and\n\nwhether the rule may be applied depends not on the cause of action asserted but\n\nrather the injury sustained.” 262 S.W.3d at 573. RLJ attempts to distinguish Galle\n\nby stating that the plaintiff in the trial court elected negligent misrepresentation\n\ndamages rather than breach of contract. RLJ Brief at 28. RLJ incorrectly asserts\n\nthat this supports the argument that the one-satisfaction rule only applies to tort\n\nclaims. Id. This Court directly confronted the argument RLJ makes here and\n\nrefuted it, plainly holding that the one-satisfaction rule applied to the breach of\n\ncontract claim. 262 S.W.3d at 573-74. This Court has confirmed the rule stated in\n\nGalle on numerous occasions. See Osborne, 252 S.W.3d at 75; Metal Bldg., 2007\n\nTex. App. LEXIS 186 at *58, n.22; Kizer, 228 S.W.3d at 392, n.3.\n\n      RLJ’s tortured interpretation of the one-satisfaction rule is wrong but, even\n\naccording to RLJ’s standards, the trial court properly applied the settlement credits\n\nin this case. RLJ pled that ESG, EBCO, and Terracon were jointly and severally\n\nliable for RLJ’s breach of contract claims. CR:202. RLJ now runs from this\n\nallegation and seeks to explain why there cannot be joint and several contractual\n\nliability. RLJ Brief at 31-32. Even where joint and several liability is addressed in\n\n\n\n                                         9                             895484.2   402/122\n\frelation to the one-satisfaction rule, the only requirement is an allegation of joint\n\nand several liability. The merits of such a claim are not relevant.\n\n         RLJ points to a recent decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the\n\nFifth Circuit 3 to argue that, where the one-satisfaction rule applies to contractual\n\nclaims, it only applies if there is a finding of joint and several liability between the\n\ndefendants. RLJ Brief at 23-34. The GE Capital decision, however, holds only\n\nthat the one-satisfaction rule requires an allegation by the plaintiff of joint and\n\nseveral liability between the defendants. 754 F.3d at 308-309. In GE Capital, the\n\nplaintiff never alleged joint liability or indivisible injury. Id. at 308. Based on the\n\nlack of any such allegations, the Fifth Circuit determined that the two defendants\n\n“did not ‘commit the same act’ or ‘commit technically different acts that result in a\n\nsingle injury.’” Id. at 309 (citation omitted). In reaching its ruling, the Fifth\n\nCircuit examined the Galle, Inc. v. Pool decision and the Texas Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in First Title Co. of Waco v. Garrett, 860 S.W.2d 74 (Tex. 1993). In\n\nGarrett, the Supreme Court applied the one-satisfaction rule “although not\n\nadjudicated to be joint tortfeasors, [the defendants] cannot reasonably be said to\n\nhave caused separate injuries” and “reaffirmed” that the one-satisfaction rule\n\n“prohibits a plaintiff from recovering twice from the same injury.” 860 S.W.2d at\n\n79.\n\n\n3\n    GE Capital Comm., Inc. v. Washington Nat’l Bank, 754 F.3d 297, 306 (5th Cir. 2014).\n                                                10                               895484.2   402/122\n\f      Addressing Garrett and Galle, the Fifth Circuit explained that those\n\ndecisions did not support application of the one-satisfaction rule in GE Capital\n\nbecause the pleadings in GE Capital did not evidence any “common liability.”\n\nGE Capital, 754 F.3d at 306-07, n.9 (emphasis added). The Fifth Circuit stated\n\nthat, unlike the pleadings in GE Capital, the pleadings in Garrett and Galle both\n\nincluded allegations that the defendants at issue were jointly liable. Id. The court\n\nreasoned that the presence of allegations of joint liability allowed application of the\n\none-satisfaction rule. Id.\n\n      Unlike GE Capital, RLJ admitted and pled that (1) RLJ’s damages were\n\n“indivisible” (CR:1266) and (2) ESG, EBCO, and Terracon were jointly and\n\nseverally liable for those damages (CR:202). The GE Capital analysis is consistent\n\nwith Texas’ one-satisfaction case law, which provides that a settlement credit is\n\napplicable where the plaintiff alleges joint liability and/or indivisible damages and\n\nsettles with one party but not another. See Galle, 262 S.W.3d at 572; Garrett, 860\n\nS.W.2d at 79.\n\n      RLJ also relies on CTTI v. Priesmeyer to argue that the one-satisfaction rule\n\nrequires a finding of joint and several contractual liability. RLJ Brief at 32-33. To\n\nthe contrary, this Court in CTTI explained the burden shifting procedure that\n\noccurs for credits under the one-satisfaction rule to mean “Where there are at least\n\nsome damages for which there could be joint and several liability,” the burden\n\n\n                                          11                             895484.2   402/122\n\fshifts to the Plaintiff to establish an allocation of damages applicable solely to the\n\nsettling parties.4 164 S.W.3d 675, at 685, n.3 (Tex. App.—Austin 2005, no pet.).\n\nAbsent such an allocation, it is presumed that all settlement amounts are joint\n\ndamages, even if it is “theoretically” possible that some damages are separable.\n\nGalle, 262 S.W.3d at 572-73.\n\n       In this case, ESG satisfied the initial burden to show that there are “at least\n\nsome damages for which there could be joint and several liability.” CTTI, 164\n\nS.W.3d at 685, n.3. RLJ sought joint and several damages from ESG, EBCO, and\n\nTerracon both in their pleadings and at trial. CR:202; RR:V.7, 159:8-20. Thus, the\n\nburden shifted to RLJ to show allocation of damages applicable only to ESG.\n\nGalle, 262 S.W.3d at 572-73. RLJ did not satisfy that burden and admitted that the\n\ndamages against ESG were “indivisible” from those alleged against EBCO and\n\nTerracon. CR:1266.\n\n       Despite pleading joint and several liability (CR:202), RLJ argues in its brief\n\nthat ESG’s contractual duties were distinct from EBCO’s and Terracon’s, so joint\n\nand several liability could not apply. RLJ Brief at 25-31. This argument must fail\n\nbecause RLJ is bound by its own pleadings, which allege joint and several\n\n\n4\n To the extent that RLJ argues that CTTI stands for the proposition that the one-satisfaction rule\nonly applies to tort claims, ESG asserts that the holding itself acknowledges and allows for the\napplication to breach of contract claims. Further, subsequent opinions of this Court have\noverruled any such precedent set by CTTI. See Galle, 262 S.W.3d at 572-73; Osborne, 252\nS.W.3d at 75; Metal Bldg., 2007 Tex.

RLJ’s analysis of the particular contractual\n\nduties of the parties is irrelevant. RLJ Brief at 34-39. The issue is not whether the\n\ncontractual duties were exactly the same, but whether “there are at least some\n\ndamages for which there could be joint and several liability.” CTTI, 164 S.W.3d at\n\n685, n.3. RLJ pled and presented their case at trial as if there were such damages.\n\n      RLJ’s argument regarding the collateral source rule is a non-sequitur, as the\n\ncollateral source rule applies only to insurance payments, which are not at issue in\n\nthis case. Brown v. American Transfer and Storage Co., 601 S.W.2d 931, 935-36\n\n(Tex. 1980). RLJ asks this Court to not only stretch the blanket of coverage\n\nafforded the collateral source rule, but to sew new patches to broaden its\n\napplication to serve RLJ’s purposes here. Contrary to RLJ’s argument, application\n\nof the one-satisfaction rule in this case cannot “obliterate” the collateral source rule\n\nbecause it does not apply. By the same token, it necessarily follows that RLJ’s\n\nrequest of this Court to make new law extending the collateral source rule should\n\nbe rejected because doing so would effectively “obliterate” the centuries-old one-\n\nsatisfaction rule.\n\n      Texas law requires RLJ to live with the consequences of their pleading and\n\nproof at trial. RLJ chose to present their case as one of joint liability and joint\n\n\n                                          13                             895484.2   402/122\n\fdamages between ESG, EBCO, and Terracon. RLJ also chose to settle its claims\n\nagainst EBCO and Terracon and receive compensation in exchange for release of\n\nthe alleged joint liability and joint damages. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in applying the one-satisfaction of judgment rule to the jury’s verdict.\n\nIII.   RLJ admitted its damages were indivisible and presented only evidence\n       of indivisible damages. (Issue No. A.2)\n       RLJ argue that, although it presented evidence of indivisible damages, the\n\njury (without any evidence) apportioned the damages only to ESG’s alleged breach\n\nof contract and excluded the other alleged breaches. RLJ Brief at 39-47. RLJ’s\n\nargument is based solely on the fact that the charge asked the jury to award\n\ndamages for ESG’s alleged breach of contract and did not include breaches by\n\nother parties. Id. RLJ also argue on appeal that its damages are not indivisible.\n\nRLJ Brief at 39-41.      RLJ judicially admitted that the damages at issue are\n\n“indivisible.” CR:1266 (“In a case involving indivisible injury such as this . . .”);\n\nTexas Standard Oil & Gas, L.P. v. Frankel Offshore Energy, Inc., 394 S.W.3d 753,\n\n764-65 (Tex. App.—Houston [14 Dist.] 2012, no pet.); Gevinson v. Manhattan\n\nConstr. Co. of Okla., 449 S.W.2d 458, 466 (Tex. 1969).\n\n       Even ignoring RLJ’s admission, their argument puts the cart before the horse\n\n– the jury can only award damages according to the proof presented at trial.\n\nBecause RLJ only presented evidence of joint or “indivisible” damages, the jury’s\n\naward necessarily included such damages. RR:V.7, 159:8-20; RLJ Brief at 13, n.4.\n\n                                          14                            895484.2   402/122\n\fIn seeking to recover damages for ESG’s alleged breach of contract, RLJ bore the\n\nburden to establish damages “resulting” from any such breach. See Snyder v.\n\nEanes Indep. Sch. Dist., 860 S.W.2d 692, 695 (Tex. App.—Austin 1993, writ\n\ndenied). RLJ provided no evidence as to the alleged damage caused by ESG. See\n\nCR:1127; RR:V.7, 159:8-20. Instead, RLJ’s evidence supporting their claim for\n\ndamages addressed the total alleged losses attributable to all design professionals,\n\ncontractors, and subcontractors on the Hotel project—including ESG, MBA,\n\nEBCO, and Terracon. Id.\n\n      Despite the lack of evidence supporting their specific damage claims against\n\nESG, RLJ claim the jury’s answers to Question 3 reflect the damages allegedly\n\nresulting from ESG’s breach alone. RLJ Brief at 39-47. This claim is based on the\n\nfact that the jury’s finding of $700,000 in lost market value damages is\n\nsubstantially less than the $6,430,000 amount RLJ’s expert, Paul Hornsby, opined\n\nto be the total market value loss on the Hotel. See CR:1127; RR:V.7, 143-44, 148.\n\nAccording to RLJ, this reduction in the amount RLJ sought to recover necessarily\n\nmeans the jury “allocated” the amount of loss attributable to ESG from the total\n\namount of the lost market value on the Hotel in answering the question on\n\ndamages. RLJ Brief at 39-47. It means nothing of the sort.\n\n      RLJ attempts to point to trial counsel’s closing argument as RLJ’s evidence\n\nof apportionment or allocation.     RLJ Brief at 45-46.      Of course, counsel’s\n\n\n                                        15                            895484.2   402/122\n\fargument is not evidence. Nevertheless, RLJ argues to this Court that in closing\n\nargument at trial, RLJ’s attorney suggested to the jury that they should subtract\n\n20% of the total alleged $6,430,000 total market value loss in determining the\n\namount of damages to award RLJ in their claim against ESG, which would make\n\nthe total approximately $5.1 million. Id. These statements in the closing argument\n\nare not evidence, and there is no evidence in the record supporting this 20%\n\nreduction argument. 5 See In re Day, 342 S.W.3d 193, 197 (Tex. App.—Beaumont\n\n2011, pet. denied); Woods v. State, 301 S.W.3d 327, 332 n.1 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2009, pet. ref’d). Counsel for ESG, on the other hand, argued there was\n\nno market value loss attributable to ESG. RR:V.10, 54:13-56:9.6\n\n       Even if there were any evidentiary basis for the lost market value damages\n\nthe jury awarded (there is not), RLJ’s assumption that the $700,000 finding reflects\n\nthe market value loss resulting from ESG’s alleged breach is just that—an\n\nunsupported assumption. There is no indication at all that the amount the jury\n\nfound was actually intended to reflect market value loss attributed to ESG. The\n\n5\n The 20% figure was apparently an arbitrary number chosen by counsel for RLJ. It was not\nbased on any testimony or documentary evidence admitted at trial.\n6\n  The only evidence of any alleged lost market value presented at trial was the expert testimony\nof Paul Hornsby. As discussed in more detail in Appellant’s Brief, Hornsby’s testimony was\nirrelevant and unreliable, and it failed to satisfy the standards for expert testimony under Texas\nlaw. See ESG Appellant’s Brief, pp. 36-56. Because RLJ failed to provide legally sufficient\nevidence of its alleged lost market value damages, there can be no recovery of such damages.\nSee Houston Unlimited, Inc. v. Mel Acres Ranch, 443 S.W.3d 820, 838, (Tex. 2014); McGinty v.\nHennen, 372 S.W.3d 625, 629 (Tex. 2012).\n\n\n                                               16                                 895484.2   402/122\n\fonly conclusion the trial court could have reached (and the conclusion this Court\n\nmust now reach), based on the evidence presented, is that the jury was not\n\npersuaded by RLJ’s evidence as to the amount of damages RLJ allegedly incurred\n\nand, as the finder of fact, rendered its verdict accordingly for a lesser amount.\n\n      Because there was no allocation evidence presented, RLJ have no basis to\n\nargue there has been any previous allocation of the alleged damages in this case.\n\nSee, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp. v. Ellender, 968 S.W.2d 917, 928 (Tex. 1998) (imposing\n\nburden on plaintiff to show sums received in settlement from other parties were not\n\nsubject to settlement credit in order to avoid settlement credit in amount of all\n\nsettlement payments). Further, the case law cited by RLJ is actually consistent\n\nwith ESG’s position.\n\n      For example, in Robertson v. ADJ Partnership, Ltd., the court held that the\n\none-satisfaction rule did not apply and the jury charge limited damages to claims\n\nagainst one party because “nothing in the record” indicated the parties were\n\n“jointly liable for the damages awarded by the jury in this case.” 204 S.W.3d 484,\n\n495 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2006, pet. denied).              Likewise, in Byer Custom\n\nBuilders, the arbitration award at issue was apportioned for specific damages,\n\nincluding “the driveway, framing, pool deck, windows, and paint.” Byer Custom\n\nBuilders v. Franks, 389 S.W.3d 880, 881 (Tex. App.—Houston [14 Dist.] 2012, no\n\n\n\n\n                                          17                             895484.2   402/122\n\fpet.).7 The common damages were to the foundation pad, which the award did not\n\ninclude. Id.\n\n      RLJ’s reliance on Tesfa v. Stewart is unpersuasive because the issue before\n\nthe court does not apply to this case. RLJ Brief at 42. There was no issue of\n\n“segregation” on appeal as described by RLJ. The appellant sought reversal of the\n\njury’s damages finding based on the assertion that there was no evidence to support\n\none element of those damages. 135 S.W.3d 272, 274-75 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth\n\n2004, pet. denied). The Second Court of Appeals found that the appellant failed to\n\nmake the objection to the trial court. Id. The Hunt v. Ellisor & Tanner case did\n\nnot involve any allegations of joint liability and/or indivisible damages either. 739\n\nS.W.2d 933 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1987, pet. denied). The Hunt opinion is in line\n\nwith the Fifth Circuit’s decision in GE Capital and does not apply here given\n\nRLJ’s joint liability and indivisible damage allegations.\n\n      The case precedent that does apply supports ESG’s position. The breach of\n\ncontract jury question addressed in Galle was nearly identical to the question in\n\nthis case. Compare CR:1127 with CR:1213. There, the plaintiffs settled with their\n\ninsurance company prior to trial against a mold remediation company for damages\n\nto their home resulting from mold. Galle, 262 S.W.3d at 566-67. The plaintiffs\n\nobtained a verdict against the mold remediation company for negligent\n\n7\n  RLJ’s quotation to this case omits with brackets the identification of these apportioned\ndamages. RLJ Brief at 43-44.\n                                           18                              895484.2   402/122\n\fmisrepresentation and breach of contract. Id. at 570. The remediation company\n\nsought a settlement credit for the insurance company’s settlement and, when the\n\ntrial court denied the request, appealed to this Court. Id. This Court found that the\n\nsettlement credit applied under either the negligent misrepresentation or breach of\n\ncontract theories because damages for both “were based on pleadings and evidence\n\nof a common harm or injury.” Id. at 574. In Galle, the jury question could not\n\nchange the pleadings and evidence the plaintiffs chose to present. The same is true\n\nin this case.\n\n       RLJ misunderstands or misconstrues the application of the one-satisfaction\n\nrule in arguing that ESG somehow received a “double-recovery.” RLJ Brief at 45-\n\n47. After ESG provided evidence, via RLJ’s pleading, of common liability and\n\ndamages and the settlement agreements were entered in the record, RLJ bore the\n\nburden to present “evidence allocating the settlement amounts to separate rather\n\nthan joint damages.” Galle, 262 S.W.3d at 574. RLJ could not because its\n\ndamages were admittedly indivisible. 8 CR:202. RLJ cannot present any actual\n\nevidence that ESG received a “double recovery” because it did not develop or\n\npresent evidence at trial to make that determination. That is why the trial court\n\n\n\n8\n  RLJ’s citation to Duncan v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 665 S.W.2d 414 (Tex. 1984), does not apply\nto this case. RLJ Brief at 47. In Duncan, Texas Supreme Court “created a comparative\ncausation scheme for product liability suits.” See Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822\nS.W.2d 1, 6 (Tex. 1991) (explaining the limited nature of the Duncan holding). No such claims\nare at issue here.\n                                             19                               895484.2   402/122\n\fcorrectly applied the full amounts of the EBCO and Terracon settlements to the\n\nverdict against ESG.\n\nIV.   Texas law unequivocally holds that the one-satisfaction rule applies to\n      breach of contract claims. (Issue No. A.3)\n      Yet again, RLJ asks this Court to create a new rule of law, this time arguing\n\nthat Texas’ statutory contribution scheme for tort claims should abolish the\n\ncommon law one-satisfaction of judgment rule.          RLJ Brief at 48-50.          This\n\nargument contradicts the history of Texas law. The one-satisfaction rule is a\n\ncommon law creation, separate from any statutory scheme. Roberts v. Grande,\n\n868 S.W.2d 956, 959 (Tex. App. —Houston [14 Dist.] 1994, no pet.) (“even\n\nthough not adjudicated as joint tortfeasors, appellee and the real estate agent and\n\nbroker cannot be said to have caused separate injuries.”); Lewis v. Exxon Co., 786\n\nS.W.2d 724, 729 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1989, no pet.) (“It is a rule of general\n\nacceptation that an injured party is entitled to but one satisfaction for the injuries\n\nsustained by him . . . although not abolished in situations where Section 33.015\n\ndoes not apply, [the one-satisfaction rule] has been severely modified in its\n\napplication by the comparative negligence statutes”) (citing Bradshaw v. Baylor\n\nUniv., 84 S.W.2d 703, 705 (1935)) (emphasis added); Hunt v. Ziegler, 271 S.W.\n\n936, 938 (Tex. App. 1925, aff’d 280 S.W. 546 (Tex. 1926)) (“when that\n\n\n\n\n                                         20                             895484.2   402/122\n\fsatisfaction is made by one of the joint tort-feasors, or by any person . . . it has the\n\neffect of releasing all others who may be jointly, or jointly and severally liable.”).9\n\n       RLJ attempts to evade the extensive case law contradicting its argument by\n\ndistinguishing the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in El Paso Natural Gas Co. v.\n\nBerryman, 858 S.W.2d 362, 364 (Tex. 1993). RLJ Brief at 50. RLJ incorrectly\n\ncontends that the alter ego issue in that case distinguishes it from other one-\n\nsatisfaction cases. Id. To the contrary, Berryman is a textbook example of the\n\none-satisfaction rule.     The plaintiff in Berryman asserted claims against two\n\ncompanies, alleging that they were alter egos. 858 S.W.2d at 363. The trial court\n\nentered a directed verdict finding alter ego, which was reversed on appeal and\n\nremanded for trial.      Id.   After the reversal, the plaintiff entered a settlement\n\nagreement with one entity, but reserved its right to sue the other. Id. The Texas\n\nSupreme Court upheld summary judgment on claims against the non-settling entity\n\nbecause the plaintiff received “full settlement” of his damages from the first entity.\n\nId. at 364. The one-satisfaction rule precluded any further recovery, regardless of\n\nthe alter ego issue. Id.\n\n       Berryman establishes the fallacy of RLJ’s argument that the one-satisfaction\n\nrule no longer exists in the common law. The rule does not have strictly defined\n\nlimits on causes of action. It simply precludes more than one recovery for the\n\n9\n See also Lewis v. Taylor, 17 Tex. 57; Andrews v.

This argument is nonsensical because those statutes do not\n\napply to breach of contract claims. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 32.001(a)\n\n(“This chapter applies only to tort actions”); § 33.002(a) (chapter applicable only\n\nto tort claims and actions under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practice Act). The\n\nplain language of those statutes evidences the legislature’s clear intent to limit the\n\nscope of those statutes to tort and/or DTPA claims.\n\n\n                                         22                             895484.2   402/122\n\f       RLJ’s analysis of Chapter 33’s legislative history is only relevant within the\n\nconfines of the statute—to tort and DTPA claims. RLJ Brief at 52. The statute has\n\nnever applied to breach of contract claims and the legislative history does not\n\naddress such claims in any way. “The words the Legislature uses should be the\n\nsurest guide to legislative intent.” Entergy Gulf States, Inc. v. Summers, 282\n\nS.W.3d 433, 437 (Tex. 2009) (citations omitted). Chapters 32 and 33 simply do\n\nnot apply to breach of contract claims and do not preempt the application of the\n\none-satisfaction rule in this case.\n\nV.     Application of the one-satisfaction rule in this case cannot violate any\n       constitutional right to freedom of contract. (Issue No. A.4)\n       RLJ next assert that applying the one satisfaction rule to limit recovery of\n\ndamages to RLJ’s actual loss would somehow violate the Texas Constitutional\n\nprovision prohibiting laws impairing the obligation of contracts. There is no basis\n\nfor this assertion.\n\n       The Texas Constitution provides that “[n]o bill of attainder, ex post facto\n\nlaw, retroactive law, or any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall be\n\nmade.” Tex. Const. art I, § 16. The provision on impairment of contracts (the\n\n“Contract Impairment Prohibition”) is based on Article I, Section 10 of the United\n\nStates Constitution, which was placed in the Constitution primarily “to prevent\n\nstates from passing laws to relieve debtors of their legal obligation to pay their\n\ndebts.” Id., interp. commentary (Vernon 2007).\n\n                                         23                            895484.2   402/122\n\f      This Court recognizes that the Contract Impairment Prohibition “applies to\n\n‘laws,’ which do not include decisions of a court.” Howell v. Texas Workers’\n\nComp. Comm’n, 143 S.W.3d 416, 444 (Tex. App.—Austin 2004, pet. denied). It is\n\nwell established in Texas that “a decision of a court is not a law, within the\n\nprovisions of the Constitution relating to impairment of contracts.” Id. (quoting\n\nAmalgamated Transit Union, Local Div. 1338 v. Dallas Pub. Transit Bd., 430\n\nS.W.2d 107, 119 (Tex. Civ. App.—Dallas 1968, writ ref’d n.r.e.)). This is not a\n\ncase in which RLJ seeks to challenge a law passed by the Texas Legislature. In\n\nfact, RLJ’s brief readily acknowledges there is no statute covering the one\n\nsatisfaction rule in connection with contract claims. RLJ Brief at 50. Accordingly,\n\nthe trial court’s decision to apply the one satisfaction rule to this case cannot\n\nviolate the Contract Impairment Prohibition. See Howell, 143 S.W.3d at 444\n\n(holding that trial court’s permanent injunction did not violate the Contract\n\nImpairment Prohibition because it was a judicial act rather than a legislative act).\n\n      Further, the Contract Impairment Prohibition “forbids only laws which\n\noperate retroactively on contracts.” Tex. Const. art I, § 16, interp. commentary\n\n(Vernon 2007) (emphasis added). There is also no evidence of any impaired\n\nvested rights. A contractual obligation is impaired under the Contract Impairment\n\nProhibition only “when a statute is enacted that releases a part of [the] obligation\n\nor to any extent or degree amounts to a material change or modifies it.” Price\n\n\n                                          24                            895484.2   402/122\n\fPfister, Inc. v. Moore & Kimmey, Inc., 48 S.W.3d 341, 356 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied). This is not a case in which a new law was passed\n\nafter contractual rights vested in favor of RLJ. Instead, it is undisputed the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule was in existence long before any contract at issue in this case.\n\nRLJ Brief at 19-20. Therefore, application of the one-satisfaction rule cannot\n\nviolate the Contract Impairment Prohibition. See Price Pfister, 48 S.W.3d at 356\n\n(holding that legislative act governing payment of commissions to sales\n\nrepresentatives did not violate Contract Impairment Prohibition because no\n\npreviously-existing contractual obligations were impaired by act’s application);\n\nTex. Const. art I, § 16.\n\nVI.   ESG did not waive or otherwise fail to preserve its right to settlement\n      credits. (Issue No. A.5)\n      RLJ complain that ESG did not object to RLJ’s failure to properly allocate\n\ndamages among multiple defendants and other settling parties. According to RLJ,\n\nESG is barred from receiving credit for settlement funds RLJ received from other\n\nparties because ESG failed to provide “notice” of ESG’s intent to argue such\n\nallocation was required. There is no merit to this argument.\n\n      As a matter of law, the one-satisfaction rule does not require that the\n\ndefendant plead the one-satisfaction rule as an affirmative defense or object to the\n\nsubmission of a jury question that may lead to a verdict that constitutes a double\n\nrecovery. National City Bank of Indiana v. Ortiz, 401 S.W.3d 867, 888 (Tex.\n\n                                        25                            895484.2   402/122\n\fApp.—Houston [14 Dist.] 2013, pet. denied); Dalworth Restoration, Inc. v. Rife-\n\nMarshall, 02-12-00381-CV, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 5271 at *26 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth May 15, 2014, no pet.). RLJ’s waiver argument does not apply here.\n\n      Further, the obvious problem with RLJ’s waiver argument is that it is RLJ’s\n\nburden – not ESG’s – to allocate RLJ’s alleged damages and recover from ESG\n\nonly those damages actually caused by ESG’s alleged breach. This Court and\n\nother Texas courts have long recognized that a plaintiff must show as a necessary\n\nelement of its breach of contract claim that the defendant’s breach caused the\n\nplaintiff’s injuries. See Snyder, 860 S.W.2d at 695 (“When a cause of action is\n\nbased on breach of contract, the plaintiff must show that . . . the defendant\n\nbreached a duty under the contract, and that the plaintiff sustained damages as a\n\nresult.”); see also Marquis Acquisitions, Inc. v. Steadfast Ins. Co., 409 S.W.3d 808,\n\n813 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no pet); B&W Supply, Inc. v. Beckman, 305 S.W.3d\n\n10, 16 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied).\n\n      ESG is not required to provide notice to RLJ about the requirements of\n\nRLJ’s causes of action, nor is ESG obligated to point out RLJ’s failure to provide\n\nevidence supporting the necessary elements of RLJ’s causes of action prior to or\n\nduring trial. See All Saints Catholic Church v. United Nat’l Ins. Co., 257 S.W.3d\n\n800, 802-03 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no pet.); Allison v. Fire Ins. Exch., 98\n\nS.W.3d 227, 258 (Tex. App.—Austin 2002, no pet.). RLJ cannot shift their burden\n\n\n                                         26                            895484.2   402/122\n\fof proof on causation and damages to ESG by arguing RLJ’s burden only exists if\n\nESG makes certain objections to RLJ’s pleadings.\n\n       Equally unavailing is RLJ’s assertion that ESG was required to object to the\n\njury charge because there was purportedly no reference to allocation of damages in\n\nthe questions and instructions submitted to the jury. First, there is no requirement\n\nfor a defendant to make any such objections in order to raise the one satisfaction\n\nrule. See Ortiz, 401 S.W.3d at 888 (holding defendant was not required to “object\n\nto the submission of more than one acceptable measure of his damages” or\n\n“request a limiting instruction” as a prerequisite to application of the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule).\n\n       Second, there was nothing wrong with the form of the damage question\n\nsubmitted to the jury. It properly asked the jury to decide the amount of damages\n\n“that resulted from” ESG’s alleged breach of contract. CR:1127. The problem is\n\nthat RLJ did not offer any evidence to answer that question, instead offering only\n\nirrelevant and unreliable expert testimony concerning a loss in market value\n\nallegedly resulting from the collective performance of numerous contractors and\n\nsubcontractors who worked on the Hotel. See Appellant’s Brief, pp. 36-56. ESG\n\nproperly objected to this inadmissible expert testimony, and is entitled to a take-\n\nnothing judgment based on RLJ’s failure to prove up market value damages.\n\n\n\n\n                                        27                            895484.2   402/122\n\fRR:V.9, 143:14-145:19; 153:6-11; CR:1130-37; Houston Unlimited, Inc. v. Mel\n\nAcres Ranch, 443 S.W.3d 820, 837-38 (Tex. 2014).10\n\n         Additionally, there is no basis for RLJ’s assertion that ESG has somehow\n\n“waived” the one-satisfaction rule by purportedly failing to plead it as an\n\naffirmative defense.        Even though ESG was not required to plead the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule, ESG’s pleadings, construed liberally as required under Texas\n\nlaw, 11 did provide notice of ESG’s intent to reduce any damage award based on\n\nsums received by other settling parties. In ESG’s Second Amended Answer, ESG\n\nspecifically alleged it is entitled to “a credit for any settlement Plaintiffs receive\n\nfrom any other person or entity.” CR:49. Although it was not required to do so,\n\nESG affirmatively asserted (1) “Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries and damages, if any,\n\nresulted, if at all, from conditions unrelated to any act, omission or conduct of\n\n[ESG]” and (2) “Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries and damages, if any, were caused, if at\n\nall, in whole or in part by the acts or omissions of others for whose conduct [ESG\n\nis] not legally responsible.” CR:48. These allegations are more than enough to put\n\nRLJ on notice of ESG’s intent to rely on the one satisfaction rule. See Bullock v.\n\nRegular Veterans Ass’n., 806 S.W.2d 311, 314 (Tex. App.—Austin 1991, no pet.).\n\n\n\n10\n  No objection is required to preserve error when expert testimony is speculative or conclusory\non its face. Coastal Transport Co. v. Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp., 136 S.W.3d 227, 233 (Tex.\n2004).\n11\n     See Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld, 34 S.W.3d 887, 897 (Tex. 2000).\n                                               28                                895484.2   402/122\n\f       Finally, RLJ’s laches argument fails because laches requires proof of\n\nunreasonable delay asserting a claim and a detrimental change of position by the\n\nparty asserting laches because of the delay. In re Laibe Corp., 307 S.W.3d 314,\n\n318 (Tex. 2010).       ESG’s pleadings clearly provide notice that ESG will seek a\n\nreduction in any damages based on settlement amounts received by RLJ from other\n\nparties and that ESG will object to the payment of any damages caused by other\n\ncontractors and subcontractors on the Hotel project. See Ortiz, 401 S.W.3d at 888;\n\nCR:48-49. Laches also applies only to equitable rights, and cannot be used in\n\nconnection with RLJ’s claims to enforce purported contractual rights. See Wayne\n\nv. A.V.A. Vending, Inc., 52 S.W.3d 412, 415 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2001, pet.\n\ndenied). Simply put, the doctrine of laches has nothing to do with this case, and\n\ncannot be used to enable RLJ to disregard the one-satisfaction rule. 12\n\nVII. The trial court properly excluded attorney’s fees attributable to EBCO\n     and Terracon from the fee award issued to RLJ. (Issue No. B)\n       In their last issue, RLJ argue, without any authority, that if the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule applies in this case, RLJ is entitled to additional attorney’s fees it\n\nincurred to prosecute its claims against EBCO and Terracon. 13             RLJ Brief at 59-\n\n62. RLJ argues that the trial court erred in failing to award RLJ fees incurred in\n\n12\n   Further, laches is an affirmative defense that must be specifically pleaded, and there is no\nreference to it in any of RLJ’s pleadings. Tex. R. Civ. P. 94; Knesek v. Witte, 754 S.W.2d 814,\n816 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, writ denied); CR:184-218.\n13\n   As established in ESG’s opening brief on its appeal, RLJ are not entitled to any fees under\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 38.001 because they are not prevailing parties\nas defined by the statute and the Texas Supreme Court. See ESG Appellant’s Brief at 13-17.\n                                              29                               895484.2   402/122\n\fprosecuting its claims against EBCO and Terracon because those claims required\n\nproof of the same facts as their claims against ESG. RLJ Brief at 59-60. However,\n\nRLJ did not make this argument to the trial court. See 3SCR1-16; Safety, 160\n\nS.W.2d at 245. Texas law only allows for recovery of unsegregated fees where\n\nthere is evidence that the legal services provided advanced all claims at issue and\n\nare so intertwined that they need not be segregated. Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v.\n\nChapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 313-14 (Tex. 2006). RLJ provided no such evidence\n\nregarding the EBCO and Terracon fees it now seeks on appeal. 3SCR1-16.\n\n       RLJ did argue at the trial level that it was entitled to fees attributable to\n\nclaims against EBCO and Terracon because, if the settlement credits are upheld,\n\nthere must be a finding of joint and several liability, which would entitle RLJ to\n\nfees jointly and severally as well.              3SCR1-16.        However, RLJ provides no\n\nauthority for this argument and there is none. 14 Further, RLJ cannot recover fees\n\nattributable to those claims because RLJ expressly settled and released their claims\n\nfor such fees. RLJ’s settlement agreement with EBCO states that all “fees, costs\n\nand expenses related to this lawsuit or the claims related to the investigation and/or\n\ndefense or pursuit of claims related to the Project will be paid by the party\n\nincurring the same.”          CR:1472.       Likewise, RLJ’s settlement agreement with\n\n\n14\n  As established in Section II, supra, a finding of joint and several liability is not required for the\napplication of the one-satisfaction rule. RLJ failed to identify any authority supporting this\nargument because it is not a part of Texas law.\n                                                  30                                  895484.2   402/122\n\fTerracon states that RLJ “shall be solely responsible for all of its own attorneys’\n\nfees and expenses incurred in connection with the Lawsuit.” CR:1479-80. RLJ’s\n\nrelease of their claims for these fees precludes any recovery from ESG.\n\n      RLJ offer no authority to support their position that they are entitled to\n\nrecover fees from ESG related to other parties or other claims. Accordingly, the\n\ntrial court did not err in excluding such fees.\n\n                                       PRAYER\n\n      WHEREFORE,          PREMISES       CONSIDERED,      Cross-Appellee         Elness,\n\nSwenson, Graham Architects, Inc. prays that this Court deny relief on the issues\n\nsubmitted by Cross-Appellants RLJ II-C Austin Air, LP, RLJ II-C Austin Air\n\nLessee, LP, and RLJ Lodging Fund II Acquisitions, LLC in their entirety; and for\n\ngeneral relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                           31                         895484.2    402/122\n\f     Respectfully submitted,\n\n        /s/ Weston M.

(“ESG”) provides\n\nthe following response to the Brief of Cross-Appellants RLJ II-C Austin Air, LP,\n\nRLJ II-C Austin Air Lessee, LP, and RLJ Lodging Fund II Acquisitions, LLC\n\n(collectively, “RLJ”):\n\n\n\n\n                                        1                              895484   402/122\n\f                           STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL FACTS\n\n       RLJ’s statement of facts and issues on appeal attempt to show allocation of\n\ndamages on appeal despite the fact that RLJ presented no such evidence to the\n\ntrial court. RLJ’s complaint alleged indivisible damages as follows:\n\n               As a direct, natural, probable, and foreseeable\n               consequence associated with breaches of contract by\n               EBCO, ESG, Swenson, HBC, Swoboda, and Terracon,\n               Plaintiffs have sustained damages for which they sue\n               herein.\n               ...\n\n               As a result of the breaches of contract, breach of\n               fiduciary duties, breach of warranty, tort/negligence\n               breaches, and negligent acts alleged above, Plaintiffs\n               have sustained damages in excess of the minimal\n               jurisdictional requirements of this court. The appropriate\n               measure of damages for the breach of contract and breach\n               of warranty claims is the difference in value between the\n               building as constructed, and the value of the building had\n               it been designed and constructed pursuant to the\n               respective contracts. In the alternative, the measure of\n               damages is the cost to fully and completely repair the\n               Project.\n\nCR:195; 200-01 (¶¶49, 73) (emphasis added).1                     RLJ did not allocate or\n\ndifferentiate between the alleged damages caused by ESG and those of the settling\n\nparties at issue, Terracon Consultants, Inc. (“Terracon”) and EBCO General\n\nContractor, Ltd., EBCO Advanced Building Systems, Ltd., and EBCO Warrior\n\nManagement LLC (collectively “EBCO”). CR:195; 200-02. Confirming this fact,\n\n1\n ESG adopts the format for citation to the record identified on pages 1-2, notes 1 and 3 of RLJ’s\nBrief.\n                                                2                                 895484.2   402/122\n\fRLJ sought “judgment against the Defendants, jointly and severally, for their\n\ndamages.” CR:202.\n\n      At trial, counsel for ESG asked RLJ’s expert witness on market value\n\ndamages if he had allocated any damages to any particular party’s breach or\n\nconduct. RR:V.7, 159:8-20. RLJ’s witness stated that he was unable to allocate or\n\n“parse out” any damages to any particular party. Id. RLJ’s appellate brief admits\n\nit did not present evidence of allocation of damages, stating “RLJ was not given\n\nthe opportunity to segregate or apportion damages to satisfy the trial court’s\n\nreasoning before the case was submitted to the jury.” RLJ Brief at 13, n.4. The\n\nrecord does not contain any request from RLJ to the trial court for an “opportunity”\n\nto present evidence segregating or apportioning its damages.\n\n      After the jury issued its verdict, ESG presented evidence that the damages\n\naward contained indivisible damages by referencing RLJ’s complaint. CR:1173-\n\n1178. ESG also submitted RLJ’s settlement agreements with Terracon and EBCO,\n\nwhich did not allocate damages to any particular claim. CR:1461-1488. RLJ\n\nagreed to release EBCO from the following:\n\n            any and all actions, causes of actions, claims, demands,\n            costs, loss of services, expenses, and compensation on\n            account of or in any way growing out of any known and\n            unknown damages which Releasors may now or hereafter\n            have against Releasees resulting, existing or alleged to\n            result from, related to or arising out of, the Project, the\n            Contract, repair/remediation of the Project, allegations\n            asserted against Releasees described in any of\n                                         3                            895484.2   402/122\n\f             Releasors’ pleadings filed in the above-referenced\n             lawsuit, involving any services, work or materials\n             provided by Releasees, or any claim(s) against\n             Releasees involving the Project.\n\nCR:1468-69 (emphasis added). Likewise, RLJ agreed to release Terracon from the\n\nfollowing:\n\n             all Claims and Causes of Action arising out of or relating\n             to the Occurrence in Question as defined above,\n             including but not limited to, all Claims and Causes of\n             Action which have been asserted, could have been\n             asserted, or may accrue in the future or otherwise become\n             known to Releasor as claims that could be asserted\n             against the Released Parties by Releasor based upon the\n             Occurrence in Question.\n\nCR:1479. The “Occurrence in Question” is defined to include the allegations in\n\nRLJ’s petition. CR:1477. ESG’s evidence of common damages and indivisible\n\ninjury shifted the burden to RLJ to provide evidence of allocation of damages.\n\nCR:1173-78.    RLJ did not provide any allocation evidence and subsequently\n\nadmitted in pleadings to the trial court that RLJ’s injuries in this case are\n\n“indivisible.” CR:1266 (“In a case involving indivisible injury, such as this . . .”)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      Based on RLJ’s pleadings and evidence at trial, the trial court properly\n\nentered a judgment applying the full amounts of the EBCO and Terracon\n\nsettlements to the jury’s verdict. CR:1437-41; 1708-12.\n\n\n\n\n                                         4                             895484.2   402/122\n\f                          SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      A plaintiff cannot recover twice for the same injury. This is not a new or\n\nnovel principle of law—case law in Texas applying this principle dates back to the\n\n1800s. Presumably seeking to maximize their recovery in this case, RLJ pled and\n\nrepeatedly emphasized that their alleged injuries (foundation damage) and alleged\n\nmonetary damages were indivisible and sought to recover all of their damages\n\njointly and severally from all defendants. Because RLJ alleged that each defendant\n\ncaused the same injury and damage, the trial court properly applied RLJ’s\n\nsettlements as credits against the jury’s verdict.   Absent evidence that RLJ’s\n\nsettlements applied to damages solely caused by parties other than ESG, which\n\nRLJ admits does not exist, Texas law requires full application of the settlement\n\ncredits to avoid double recovery.\n\n                                    ARGUMENT\n\nI.

Weighing the evidence\n\nwith respect to the amount of the settlement credit involves the exercise of the trial\n\ncourt’s discretion, and the trial court will not be held to have abused its discretion\n\nif some evidence reasonably supports its decision. Utts v. Short, No. 03-03-00512,\n\n2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 2874, at *10-11 (Tex. App.—Austin Apr. 1, 2004, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\nII.    Texas law does not require joint and several liability for application of\n       the one-satisfaction rule. (Issue No. A.1)\n\n       RLJ has scant authority for its position that the one-satisfaction rule does not\n\napply in this case. Attempting to craft an argument where precedent does not exist,\n\nRLJ argues that the one-satisfaction rule was created only to apply to contribution\n\nclaims and never intended to apply outside of tort claims. RLJ Brief at 19-21. To\n\nthe contrary, the Texas Supreme Court began enforcing the one-satisfaction rule as\n\nearly as 1856, with the only requisite being that the claimant may not recover twice\n\nfor the same injury. 2 The Supreme Court has explained that Texas’ statutory\n\ncontribution scheme for tort claims upholds the broader one-satisfaction rule.

The Supreme Court in Utts did not\n\nfind that Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapter 33 supersedes the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule—it complements the one-satisfaction rule. Id. As the recent\n\nTexas precedent discussed below reveals, the one-satisfaction rule applies to any\n\nand all claims and simply holds that a party may not recover for the same injury\n\ntwice.\n\n         RLJ seeks to inhibit the simple application of the one-satisfaction rule by\n\nintroducing a new requirement—joint and several liability. RLJ’s description of\n\njoint and several tort liability and Texas’ statutory contribution scheme is a straw\n\nman intended to deflect attention from Texas’ common law one-satisfaction rule.\n\nRLJ Brief at 21-22. The authority contrary to RLJ’s position is overwhelming—\n\nneither this Court nor any other appellate jurisdiction in Texas holds that the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule is limited by the particular cause of action asserted by the plaintiff:\n\n               Galle, Inc. v.

Even where joint and several liability is addressed in\n\n\n\n                                         9                             895484.2   402/122\n\frelation to the one-satisfaction rule, the only requirement is an allegation of joint\n\nand several liability. The merits of such a claim are not relevant.\n\n         RLJ points to a recent decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the\n\nFifth Circuit 3 to argue that, where the one-satisfaction rule applies to contractual\n\nclaims, it only applies if there is a finding of joint and several liability between the\n\ndefendants. RLJ Brief at 23-34. The GE Capital decision, however, holds only\n\nthat the one-satisfaction rule requires an allegation by the plaintiff of joint and\n\nseveral liability between the defendants. 754 F.3d at 308-309. In GE Capital, the\n\nplaintiff never alleged joint liability or indivisible injury. Id. at 308. Based on the\n\nlack of any such allegations, the Fifth Circuit determined that the two defendants\n\n“did not ‘commit the same act’ or ‘commit technically different acts that result in a\n\nsingle injury.’” Id. at 309 (citation omitted).

The Fifth Circuit stated\n\nthat, unlike the pleadings in GE Capital, the pleadings in Garrett and Galle both\n\nincluded allegations that the defendants at issue were jointly liable. Id. The court\n\nreasoned that the presence of allegations of joint liability allowed application of the\n\none-satisfaction rule. Id.\n\n      Unlike GE Capital, RLJ admitted and pled that (1) RLJ’s damages were\n\n“indivisible” (CR:1266) and (2) ESG, EBCO, and Terracon were jointly and\n\nseverally liable for those damages (CR:202). The GE Capital analysis is consistent\n\nwith Texas’ one-satisfaction case law, which provides that a settlement credit is\n\napplicable where the plaintiff alleges joint liability and/or indivisible damages and\n\nsettles with one party but not another. See Galle, 262 S.W.3d at 572; Garrett, 860\n\nS.W.2d at 79.\n\n      RLJ also relies on CTTI v.

RLJ sought joint and several damages from ESG, EBCO, and\n\nTerracon both in their pleadings and at trial. CR:202; RR:V.7, 159:8-20. Thus, the\n\nburden shifted to RLJ to show allocation of damages applicable only to ESG.\n\nGalle, 262 S.W.3d at 572-73. RLJ did not satisfy that burden and admitted that the\n\ndamages against ESG were “indivisible” from those alleged against EBCO and\n\nTerracon. CR:1266.\n\n       Despite pleading joint and several liability (CR:202), RLJ argues in its brief\n\nthat ESG’s contractual duties were distinct from EBCO’s and Terracon’s, so joint\n\nand several liability could not apply.

RLJ Brief at 39-47. This claim is based on the\n\nfact that the jury’s finding of $700,000 in lost market value damages is\n\nsubstantially less than the $6,430,000 amount RLJ’s expert, Paul Hornsby, opined\n\nto be the total market value loss on the Hotel. See CR:1127; RR:V.7, 143-44, 148.\n\nAccording to RLJ, this reduction in the amount RLJ sought to recover necessarily\n\nmeans the jury “allocated” the amount of loss attributable to ESG from the total\n\namount of the lost market value on the Hotel in answering the question on\n\ndamages.

Nevertheless, RLJ argues to this Court that in closing\n\nargument at trial, RLJ’s attorney suggested to the jury that they should subtract\n\n20% of the total alleged $6,430,000 total market value loss in determining the\n\namount of damages to award RLJ in their claim against ESG, which would make\n\nthe total approximately $5.1 million.

Accordingly,\n\nthe trial court’s decision to apply the one satisfaction rule to this case cannot\n\nviolate the Contract Impairment Prohibition. See Howell, 143 S.W.3d at 444\n\n(holding that trial court’s permanent injunction did not violate the Contract\n\nImpairment Prohibition because it was a judicial act rather than a legislative act).\n\n      Further, the Contract Impairment Prohibition “forbids only laws which\n\noperate retroactively on contracts.” Tex.

First, there is no requirement\n\nfor a defendant to make any such objections in order to raise the one satisfaction\n\nrule. See Ortiz, 401 S.W.3d at 888 (holding defendant was not required to “object\n\nto the submission of more than one acceptable measure of his damages” or\n\n“request a limiting instruction” as a prerequisite to application of the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule).\n\n       Second, there was nothing wrong with the form of the damage question\n\nsubmitted to the jury.

The problem is\n\nthat RLJ did not offer any evidence to answer that question, instead offering only\n\nirrelevant and unreliable expert testimony concerning a loss in market value\n\nallegedly resulting from the collective performance of numerous contractors and\n\nsubcontractors who worked on the Hotel.

Even though ESG was not required to plead the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule, ESG’s pleadings, construed liberally as required under Texas\n\nlaw, 11 did provide notice of ESG’s intent to reduce any damage award based on\n\nsums received by other settling parties. In ESG’s Second Amended Answer, ESG\n\nspecifically alleged it is entitled to “a credit for any settlement Plaintiffs receive\n\nfrom any other person or entity.” CR:49. Although it was not required to do so,\n\nESG affirmatively asserted (1) “Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries and damages, if any,\n\nresulted, if at all, from conditions unrelated to any act, omission or conduct of\n\n[ESG]” and (2) “Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries and damages, if any, were caused, if at\n\nall, in whole or in part by the acts or omissions of others for whose conduct [ESG\n\nis] not legally responsible.” CR:48.

See ESG Appellant’s Brief at 13-17.\n                                              29                               895484.2   402/122\n\fprosecuting its claims against EBCO and Terracon because those claims required\n\nproof of the same facts as their claims against ESG. RLJ Brief at 59-60. However,\n\nRLJ did not make this argument to the trial court. See 3SCR1-16; Safety, 160\n\nS.W.2d at 245. Texas law only allows for recovery of unsegregated fees where\n\nthere is evidence that the legal services provided advanced all claims at issue and\n\nare so intertwined that they need not be segregated. Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v.\n\nChapa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313-14 (Tex. 2006). RLJ provided no such evidence\n\nregarding the EBCO and Terracon fees it now seeks on appeal. 3SCR1-16.\n\n       RLJ did argue at the trial level that it was entitled to fees attributable to\n\nclaims against EBCO and Terracon because, if the settlement credits are upheld,\n\nthere must be a finding of joint and several liability, which would entitle RLJ to\n\nfees jointly and severally as well.              3SCR1-16.        However, RLJ provides no\n\nauthority for this argument and there is none. 14 Further, RLJ cannot recover fees\n\nattributable to those claims because RLJ expressly settled and released their claims\n\nfor such fees. RLJ’s settlement agreement with EBCO states that all “fees, costs\n\nand expenses related to this lawsuit or the claims related to the investigation and/or\n\ndefense or pursuit of claims related to the Project will be paid by the party\n\nincurring the same.”          CR:1472.       Likewise, RLJ’s settlement agreement with\n\n\n14\n  As established in Section II, supra, a finding of joint and several liability is not required for the\napplication of the one-satisfaction rule. RLJ failed to identify any authority supporting this\nargument because it is not a part of Texas law.\n                                                  30                                  895484.2   402/122\n\fTerracon states that RLJ “shall be solely responsible for all of its own attorneys’\n\nfees and expenses incurred in connection with the Lawsuit.” CR:1479-80. RLJ’s\n\nrelease of their claims for these fees precludes any recovery from ESG.\n\n      RLJ offer no authority to support their position that they are entitled to\n\nrecover fees from ESG related to other parties or other claims. Accordingly, the\n\ntrial court did not err in excluding such fees.\n\n                                       PRAYER\n\n      WHEREFORE,          PREMISES       CONSIDERED,      Cross-Appellee         Elness,\n\nSwenson, Graham Architects, Inc. prays that this Court deny relief on the issues\n\nsubmitted by Cross-Appellants RLJ II-C Austin Air, LP, RLJ II-C Austin Air\n\nLessee, LP, and RLJ Lodging Fund II Acquisitions, LLC in their entirety; and for\n\ngeneral relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                           31                         895484.2    402/122\n\f     Respectfully submitted,\n\n        /s/ Weston M.
