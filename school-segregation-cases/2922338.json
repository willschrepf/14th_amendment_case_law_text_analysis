Norwood brought this section 1983\naction alleging that prison officials violated the Eighth\nAmendment when they denied him outdoor exercise during\nfour separate extended lockdowns over the course of two\nyears.\n\n   The prison initiated these lockdowns after serious inmate\nassaults on staff. During the lockdowns, inmates were con-\nfined to their cells and normal programs were suspended\nwhile officials investigated the violence. Based on what they\nlearned, officials gradually eased restrictions on specific\ngangs, ethnic and racial groups, restoring outdoor exercise\nsooner for inmates who they believed would pose less risk of\nfurther violence. Norwood was not a gang member, but gang\n\f8498                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\nmembers often pressured unaffiliated inmates of the same\nrace or ethnicity to assist them. Prison officials therefore\nbelieved that limiting the scope of lockdowns to gang mem-\nbers would be inadequate to ensure safety.\n\n   During this two-year period, there were also numerous\ninmate-on-inmate attacks. Officials did not always initiate\ntotal lockdowns after such attacks. According to one defen-\ndant, the prison’s response to inmate-on-inmate violence\n“[d]epends on the circumstances of the assault. . . . [I]f it’s\nfisticuffs, and it’s a one-on-one situation, no, we wouldn’t\nlock down for that. If it’s a slashing assault, or a stomping, or\nmultiple inmates involved in a melee, then yes, we would lock\ndown . . . .”\n\n   Officials initiated the first lockdown in early 2002 after\neleven Hispanic inmates attacked four correctional officers,\nnearly killing one of them. Prison officials didn’t know if the\nattack was planned or isolated. They also didn’t know, and\nwere never able to ascertain, who provided the weapons. The\nweeks following the attack brought a series of inmate-on-\ninmate attacks, including a homicide, as well as another\nattempted murder of an officer. Officials eventually decided\nit was safe to begin restoring normal programs, beginning\nwith “critical workers.” Norwood was in the second group of\nworkers to resume outdoor exercise. His exercise had been\nsuspended for about three months.\n\n   In early May, a black inmate stabbed an officer in a dining\nhall. Officials initiated a second lockdown but began restoring\nnormal programs by the end of the month. By mid-July, pris-\noners other than blacks had resumed outdoor exercise. Even\nso, attacks on officers occurred during this lockdown, includ-\ning a battery and an attempted battery. Norwood, who is\nblack, was denied exercise for three months.\n\n In the waning days of 2002, black inmates attempted to\nmurder a correctional officer, and a number of black Crips\n\f                      NORWOOD v. VANCE                       8499\nattacked staff members. Officials initiated a third lockdown,\nduring the course of which inmates committed four batteries\nor attempted batteries of officers and five batteries or\nattempted murders of inmates. During this lockdown, Nor-\nwood’s outdoor exercise was suspended for four and a half\nmonths.\n\n   In September of 2003, a black Crip attempted to murder an\nofficer. Because of the seriousness of the incident and the fact\nthat it was the fourth major assault on staff in a 19-month\nperiod, officers locked down all inmates and declared a state\nof emergency. Officers eventually determined that the\nattacker had acted alone and began restoring outdoor exercise.\nBut the violence continued. Certain white inmates, and those\ncelled with them, were locked down because of an attempted\nmurder of an inmate in November, and certain Crips and their\ncellmates remained on lockdown from earlier violence. Nor-\nwood was denied outdoor exercise for two months.\n\n  A jury found that defendants violated Norwood’s Eighth\nAmendment right to outdoor exercise but concluded that Nor-\nwood suffered no harm and thus awarded no compensatory\ndamages. The jury did award $11 in nominal damages and\n$39,000 in punitive damages. The district court awarded\n$23,875.55 in attorney’s fees. Defendants appeal.\n\n                           Analysis\n\n                               I\n\n  Defendants claim the district court erred by refusing to give\nthe following jury instruction:\n\n    In considering whether defendants were deliberately\n    indifferent to the need for outdoor exercise, the jury\n    should consider that defendants had a competing\n    obligation under the Eighth Amendment to ensure\n    the safety of prisoners, including protecting prison-\n\f8500                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\n    ers from each other. In considering these factors, you\n    should give deference to prison officials in the adop-\n    tion and execution of policies and practices that in\n    their judgment are needed to preserve discipline and\n    to maintain internal security in a prison.\n\nThe district court initially agreed to the language but, after\nplaintiff objected, declined to include it on the ground that\n“deference” was “undefined.” Because defendants challenge\nthe resulting jury instruction as an incomplete, and therefore\nincorrect, statement of the law our review is de novo. Clem\nv. Lomeli, No. 07-16764, slip op. at 6572 (9th Cir. June 2,\n2009); Dang v. Cross, 422 F.3d 800, 804-06 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\n   Plaintiff argues that defendants failed to preserve their\nobjection below. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(2). But the record\nshows that defendants contested the district court’s decision\nnot to include the proposed language and made the grounds\nfor their position clear, citing relevant authority. An “objec-\ntion need not be formal,” and defendants’ proffered language\nwas “sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise\nnature of the alleged error.” Inv. Serv. Co. v. Allied Equities\nCorp., 519 F.2d 508, 510 (9th Cir. 1975). Nor did the district\njudge’s vague statement that defendants “may” have an\nopportunity to change his mind counter the overall impression\nthat raising the issue again via formal objection would be both\n“unavailing” and a “pointless formality.” Glover v. Bic Corp.,\n6 F.3d 1318, 1326 (9th Cir. 1993).\n\n   [1] It is well established that judges and juries must defer\nto prison officials’ expert judgments. In Bell v. Wolfish, the\nSupreme Court explained:\n\n    [T]he problems that arise in the day-to-day operation\n    of a corrections facility are not susceptible of easy\n    solutions. Prison administrators therefore should be\n    accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and\n    execution of policies and practices that in their judg-\n\f                       NORWOOD v. VANCE                      8501\n    ment are needed to preserve internal order and disci-\n    pline and maintain institutional security.\n\n441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979). Six years later, the Court spelled\nout that deference requires “that neither judge nor jury freely\nsubstitute their judgment for that of officials who have made\na considered choice.” Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 322\n(1985) (emphasis added). The Court confirmed that Bell\nremains good law in Farmer v. Brennan, its seminal opinion\non challenges to conditions of confinement, which twice cited\nBell with approval. 511 U.S. 825, 845, 847 (1994).\n\n   The district court declined to give the proposed instruction\nbecause the meaning of deference would not be “clear to a lay\nperson.” But “deference” is not Urdu or Klingon; it is a com-\nmon English word. See, e.g., Michael Crichton, Airframe 78\n(1996) (“[S]he certainly knew where all the bodies were bur-\nied. Within the company, she was treated with a deference\nbordering on fear.”). It may be true that deference has varied\nmeanings, Dissent at 8515 n.4, but so do most English words.\nIf the district judge believed the term needed further context\nor definition, he could have provided it.\n\n   [2] Perfect or not, the defendants’ proposed instruction\nbrought the issue of deference to the district court’s attention.\n“[T]he fact that the proposed instruction was misleading does\nnot alone permit the district judge to summarily refuse to give\nany instruction on the topic.” Merrick v. Paul Revere Life Ins.\nCo., 500 F.3d 1007, 1017 (9th Cir. 2007). The district court\nomitted the instruction altogether, rather than modifying it to\ncorrect the perceived deficiency. The remaining instructions\nfailed to alert the jury that the deliberate indifference standard\n“incorporates due regard for prison officials’ ‘unenviable task\nof keeping dangerous men in safe custody under humane con-\nditions.’ ” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845 (quoting Spain v. Procu-\nnier, 600 F.2d 189, 193 (9th Cir. 1979)). The dissent\napparently believes that, because Farmer “incorporates” Bell\ndeference, the use of language drawn from Farmer was ade-\n\f8502                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\nquate to instruct the jury. Dissent at 8513. But juries are not\nclairvoyant and will not know to defer unless they are told to\ndo so.\n\n   [3] We have long recognized that additional instruction\nregarding deference is required in cases applying Whitley to\nallegedly excessive force by prison officials. See Ninth Cir-\ncuit Manual of Model Jury Instructions § 9.24 (2007 ed.). The\ndissent accuses us of improperly extending the Whitley regime\nto a case involving conditions of confinement. Dissent at\n8511. But defendants’ proposed instruction was not drawn\nfrom Whitley; it was drawn from Bell—itself a conditions of\nconfinement case. Bell, 441 U.S. at 534, 547. Prison officials\nare entitled to deference whether a prisoner challenges exces-\nsive force or conditions of confinement. See Whitley, 475 U.S.\nat 322; Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845. Indeed, conditions of con-\nfinement and use of force are often flip sides of the same coin:\nA more restrictive confinement may diminish the need for\nforce and vice versa.\n\n   [4] As the government recognized at trial, the court’s\ninstruction correctly stated Farmer’s deliberate indifference\nstandard. But the court’s failure to give additional guidance\non deference rendered the instruction incomplete and mislead-\ning. And the error was also prejudicial. If properly instructed,\nthe jurors might well have reached a different conclusion.\nNorwood has not met his burden of showing the verdict\nwould “more probably than not” have been the same absent\nthe error. Clem, slip op. at 6575. We therefore vacate the\njury’s verdict and damages awards.\n\n                               II\n\n  We would normally remand for a new trial, but as defen-\ndants are entitled to qualified immunity that is not necessary\nhere. Our dissenting colleague may be right that defendants\nwaived the immunity claim by failing to raise it to the district\ncourt during or immediately after trial. On appeal, however,\n\f                      NORWOOD v. VANCE                      8503\nNorwood failed to argue waiver; rather, he addressed quali-\nfied immunity on the merits while arguing waiver of the two\nother principal issues in the case. In Tortu v. Las Vegas Met-\nropolitan Police Department, 556 F.3d 1075 (9th Cir. 2009),\ncited by the dissent, see Dissent at 8517, plaintiff explicitly\nargued that defendants had forfeited qualified immunity by\nfailing to make the proper motion below. Tortu, 556 F.3d at\n1081.\n\n   [5] It is “well-established” that a party can “ ‘waive waiver’\nimplicitly by failing to assert it.” Tokatly v. Ashcroft, 371\nF.3d 613, 618 (9th Cir. 2004); United States v. Garcia-Lopez,\n309 F.3d 1121, 1123 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Wilson v.\nKelkhoff, 86 F.3d 1438, 1445 (7th Cir. 1996) (plaintiff waived\ndefendant’s waiver of absolute immunity defense). Norwood\nwaived the defendants’ waiver by addressing the claim on the\nmerits without also making a waiver argument. Cf. Chicano\nEduc. & Manpower Servs. v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 909 F.2d\n1320, 1327-28 & n.5 (9th Cir. 1990) (“Yes, we are indeed\nholding that the Department has waived its right to argue that\nCEMS waived its right to ask for a waiver . . . .”). The dissent\nwould have us raise the issue of waiver sua sponte and sug-\ngests that we have “discretion” not to reach defendants’ quali-\nfied immunity claim. Dissent at 8518-19. But “[t]his court\nwill not address waiver if not raised by the opposing party.”\nUnited States v. Doe, 53 F.3d 1081, 1802-83 (9th Cir. 1995)\n(quoting United States v. Schlesinger, 49 F.3d 483, 485 (9th\nCir. 1995)). Even if we had such discretion, we believe the\nmore prudent course is to resolve the case on the basis of the\nissues actually briefed and argued by the parties.\n\n   [6] When a party waives waiver, we proceed directly to the\nmerits. See, e.g., Tokatly, 371 F.3d at 618-24; Doe, 53 F.3d\nat 1083-84; Wilson, 86 F.3d at 1445-46. We do not, as the dis-\nsent suggests, Dissent at 8519-20, engage in plain error\nreview. Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity so long\nas a right to outdoor exercise in the midst of severe ongoing\nprison violence was not clearly established at the time defen-\n\f8504                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\ndants acted. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201-02\n(2001). “The relevant, dispositive inquiry . . . is whether it\nwould be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was\nunlawful in the situation he confronted.” Id. at 202 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n   [7] Three factors weigh heavily in our analysis: First, as\nSaucier explains, the qualified immunity inquiry is highly\ncontext-sensitive, turning on whether it would be clear to a\nreasonable officer that denying outdoor exercise was unlawful\n“in the situation he confronted.” Id. The extraordinary vio-\nlence gripping the prison threatened staff and inmates alike,\nand there was a serious risk that gangs would press unaffili-\nated inmates like Norwood into service. See pp.8497-99\nsupra. While Norwood argues that a reasonable officer would\nhave known that denying outdoor exercise in the midst of\nongoing prison violence violated his rights, he cites just one\ncase Allen v. Sakai, 48 F.3d 1082 (9th Cir. 1995)—for the\ngeneral proposition that the Ninth Circuit “is one of many\n[courts] that have held that there is a constitutional right to\noutdoor exercise for inmates.”\n\n   But Allen does not hold that a prisoner’s right to outdoor\nexercise is absolute and indefeasible, or that it trumps all\nother considerations. Plaintiffs in Allen survived summary\njudgment because prison officials there relied on “inconse-\nquential logistical concerns” to justify denying outdoor exer-\ncise. Id. at 1088. Defendants here had substantial reasons for\nimposing the lockdowns: They were attempting to restore\norder during a series of brutal attacks, some lethal or nearly\nso. They did not place “inconsequential logistical concerns”\nabove Norwood’s need for outdoor exercise. And plaintiff\noffered no evidence that the lockdowns were meant to be\npunitive or were otherwise implemented in bad faith.\n\n   [8] Second, prison officials have a duty to keep inmates\nsafe, and in particular to protect them from each other. Far-\nmer, 511 U.S. at 832-33; LeMaire v. Maass, 12 F.3d 1444,\n\f                      NORWOOD v. VANCE                        8505\n1462 (9th Cir. 1993). Officials must balance this imperative\nagainst other obligations that our laws impose, such as provid-\ning outdoor exercise. When violence rises to unusually high\nlevels, prison officials can reasonably believe it is lawful to\ntemporarily restrict outdoor exercise to help bring the vio-\nlence under control. We’ve explained that “prison officials\nhave a right and a duty to take the necessary steps to reestab-\nlish order in a prison when such order is lost. This is for the\nbenefit of the prisoners as much as for the benefit of the\nprison officials.” Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1259 (9th\nCir. 1982). Here, at least one prisoner had died; others (pris-\noners and guards) had been severely wounded. Defendants\nhad to act decisively to stop the violence.\n\n   The dissent claims that the “jury reasonably rejected defen-\ndants’ argument that unusual levels of violence justified the\nlong-term deprivations in this case” because “defendants con-\nceded on cross-examination that ‘those types of [violent] inci-\ndents occur even when there is no lockdown,’ with the same\nfrequency, and that ‘the violence is pretty steady.’ ” Dissent\nat 8524-25 (emphasis omitted). But there’s more to the former\nwarden’s testimony:\n\n    While we were on lockdown status, these types of\n    things continued to happen. Either as we incremen-\n    tally unlocked and released to the small yards for\n    exercise, or sent—you know, releasing—lifting the\n    privileges to go to meals or whatever, violence con-\n    tinued to happen. And if that violence was—\n    occurred based on a decision that we made that we\n    felt it was safe, and we let the small group of prison-\n    ers out and something happened, then we would call\n    back our prior decision. [Emphasis added.]\n\nWhat we understand the warden to be saying is that the lock-\ndowns were effective at curbing violence, and that violence\nresumed as privileges were restored.\n\f8506                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\n   Such decisions are not to be judged with the benefit of\nhindsight, in any event. It matters not whether the measures\ntaken actually worked but whether prison officials reasonably\nbelieved they would be effective in stopping the violence. At\nmost, prison officials here may be faulted for erring on the\nside of caution by maintaining lockdowns for longer than nec-\nessary. But, when it comes to matters of life and death, erring\non the side of caution is a virtue. Certainly, no officer could\nreasonably have anticipated that such prudence would be\nfound to violate the constitution.\n\n   [9] Third, when balancing the obligation to provide for\ninmate and staff safety against the duty to accord inmates the\nrights and privileges to which they are entitled, prison offi-\ncials are afforded “wide-ranging deference.” Bell, 441 U.S. at\n547. When a “lockdown was in response to a genuine emer-\ngency,” and “restrictions were eased as the prison administra-\ntion determined that the emergency permitted,” we may not\nlightly second-guess officials’ expert judgments about when\nexercise and other programs could safely be restored. “These\ndecisions are delicate ones, and those charged with them must\nbe given reasonable leeway.” Hayward v. Procunier, 629\nF.2d 599, 603 (9th Cir. 1980).\n\n   [10] It would be particularly odd to hold that liability\nattaches in this case, where hindsight validates defendants’\ndecisions. The record makes clear that a great deal of violence\ntook place during outdoor exercise. While denying outdoor\nexercise for extended periods carried some risk of harm, offi-\ncials’ judgment that there was a greater risk of harm from\nallowing outdoor exercise was certainly reasonable. Indeed,\nNorwood suffered no injuries from attacks by other inmates\nor from being denied outdoor exercise—a fact the jury recog-\nnized by awarding no compensatory damages. Norwood\nmight have fared less well had prison officials been less cau-\ntious. Although exercise is “one of the basic human necessi-\nties protected by the Eighth Amendment,” LeMaire, 12 F.3d\nat 1457, “a temporary denial of outdoor exercise with no med-\n\f                      NORWOOD v. VANCE                      8507\nical effects is not a substantial deprivation.” May v. Baldwin,\n109 F.3d 557, 565 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n   [11] We therefore conclude that a reasonable officer could\nhave believed that restricting Norwood’s outdoor exercise\nwas lawful. Certainly, no authority clearly established the\ncontrary. Allen didn’t. See p.8504 supra. And Spain v. Procu-\nnier, 600 F.2d 189 (9th Cir. 1979), concerned inmates in\ndisciplinary segregation who were denied outdoor exercise as\na normal condition of their confinement, id. at 199-200, rather\nthan for safety during emergencies. Not surprisingly, our dis-\ntrict courts have found an absence of Eighth Amendment lia-\nbility on facts similar to these. See, e.g., Jones v. Garcia, 430\nF. Supp. 2d 1095, 1102-03 (S.D. Cal. 2006) (finding no\nEighth Amendment violation where prisoner was denied out-\ndoor exercise for ten months—double the longest single\nperiod that Norwood’s exercise was restricted—because of\nongoing violence); Hayes v. Garcia, 461 F. Supp. 2d 1198,\n1201, 1207-08 (S.D. Cal. 2006) (same for nine-month denial\nof outdoor exercise); Hurd v. Garcia, 454 F. Supp. 2d 1032,\n1042-45 (S.D. Cal. 2006) (same for five-month denial).\n\n   Norwood argues that defendants had no need to conduct\nlengthy lockdown investigations because those investigations\neither found that the initial assaults were isolated incidents or\nelse could not determine who else was involved. Norwood\nalso argues that defendants could have limited exercise\nrestrictions to specific groups of prisoners. But the investiga-\ntions were reasonable precautions, and defendants had no way\nof knowing beforehand what they would yield. That defen-\ndants imposed general lockdowns after some attacks on staff\nbut only group-specific restrictions after some attacks on\ninmates does not show malicious intent or deliberate indiffer-\nence. Attacks on staff are, by their nature, more serious chal-\nlenges to prison authority than attacks on other inmates.\n\n   [12] We decline Norwood’s invitation to micro-manage\nofficials whose expertise in prison administration far exceeds\n\f8508                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\nour own, and we conclude that defendants are entitled to qual-\nified immunity. On remand, the district court shall enter judg-\nment consistent with this opinion.\n\n  [13] Because plaintiff is no longer the prevailing party, we\nvacate the award of attorney’s fees.\n\n  REVERSED.\n\n\n\nTHOMAS, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   There is no reason on this record to disturb the jury verdict.\nThe district court correctly analyzed the law and properly\ninstructed the jury consistent with our precedent. The jury\nconsidered all of the evidence and rejected the government’s\ntheory that defendants were not deliberately indifferent\nbecause security concerns justified the ongoing deprivations.\nSubstantial evidence supports the jury verdict.\n\n   I would not reach the question of qualified immunity\nbecause the government did not preserve the issue for appeal.\nAssuming for argument’s sake that it was proper for us to\nentertain the defense, I would hold that the defendants were\nnot entitled to qualified immunity. Clearly established law\nprecludes prison officials from depriving inmates of outdoor\nexercise for extended periods absent exigent circumstances.\nThe jury’s finding that defendants acted with reckless disre-\ngard to the risk to Norwood’s health and safety leaves no\nroom to conclude defendants could reasonably have believed\ntheir actions lawful.\n\n  For these reasons, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n                                I\n\n   We afford trial judges “substantial latitude in tailoring jury\ninstructions.” Mockler v. Multnomah County, 140 F.3d 808,\n\f                       NORWOOD v. VANCE                        8509\n812 (9th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted). Here, there is no doubt\nthat the district court properly instructed the jury on the essen-\ntial elements of the claim at issue. Indeed, the government\nconcedes that the jury was properly instructed, and it did not\nobject to the instruction given by the district court. What the\ngovernment sought was an additional, misleading instruction\nthat would have engrafted supplemental requirements onto\nthose dictated by precedent. The district court found that the\nnew instruction was unclear, undefined, and used language\nthat would be confusing to a lay jury. A district court does not\ncommit error in rejecting a misleading supplementary instruc-\ntion that is at odds with a controlling instruction everyone\nagrees was properly given. “Jury instructions must be formu-\nlated so that they fairly and adequately cover the issues pre-\nsented, correctly state the law, and are not misleading.” Id.\n(citation omitted).\n\n   This case involved a challenge to prison conditions—\nspecifically, the long-term deprivation of outdoor exercise—\nto which the deliberate indifference standard applies. The jury\nwas instructed that:\n\n    To establish deliberate indifference plaintiff must\n    prove defendant knew that plaintiff faced a substan-\n    tial risk of serious harm to his health or safety and\n    disregarded that risk by failing to take reasonable\n    measures to correct it. Under the deliberate indiffer-\n    ence standard, defendant must have been aware of\n    facts from which the inference could be drawn that\n    a substantial risk of serious harm to plaintiff’s health\n    or safety existed due to deprivation of outdoor exer-\n    cise, and defendant must also have drawn that infer-\n    ence.\n\n   The jury was further instructed that “[a] defendant who\nactually knew of a substantial risk of a serious harm to plain-\ntiff’s health or safety may be found free from liability if he\nresponded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm was not\n\f8510                   NORWOOD v. VANCE\nultimately averted.” These instructions set forth—almost\nverbatim—the deliberate indifference culpability standard for\ncases involving challenges to prison conditions announced by\nthe Supreme Court in Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825\n(1994). See id. at 837 (“We hold . . . that a prison official can-\nnot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying\nan inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the offi-\ncial knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate\nhealth or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from\nwhich the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of\nserious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.”);\nid. at 844 (“[P]rison officials who actually knew of a substan-\ntial risk to inmate health or safety may be found free from lia-\nbility if they responded reasonably to the risk, even if the\nharm ultimately was not averted.”). In combination with the\ninstruction that exercise did not have to be provided if “in-\nclement weather, unusual circumstances, or disciplinary needs\nmakes that impossible,” the instructions conveyed to the jury\nthat it could not find defendants liable if the officials knew of\nthe risk posed by continuing the lockdowns without providing\nfor exercise, but responded reasonably to that risk under the\ncircumstances.\n\n   The government agreed that the jury instruction that “exer-\ncise must be provided unless inclement weather, unusual cir-\ncumstances, or disciplinary needs makes that impossible” was\n“an adequate and proper statement of the law.” See Allen v.\nSakai, 40 F.3d 1001, 1004 (1994) (stating that prison officials\nwere required to “provide regular outdoor exercise to [the\nplaintiff] unless ‘inclement weather, unusual circumstances,\nor disciplinary needs made that impossible’ ”) (quoting Spain\nv. Procunier, 600 F.2d 189, 199 (1979) (Kennedy, J.))).\n\n   What the government sought was an additional instruction\nthat amounted to a command to direct a verdict in favor of the\ngovernment:\n\n    In considering whether defendants were deliberately\n    indifferent to the need for outdoor exercise, the jury\n\f                          NORWOOD v. VANCE                           8511\n     should consider that defendants had a competing\n     obligation under the Eighth Amendment to ensure\n     the safety of prisoners, including protecting prison-\n     ers from each other. In considering these factors, you\n     should give deference to prison officials in the adop-\n     tion and execution of policies and practices that in\n     their judgment are needed to preserve discipline and\n     maintain internal stability in a prison.\n\nThe district court rejected the proffered jury instruction\nbecause he found the deference language unclear and unde-\nfined, noting that “one of my jobs as a judge is to provide the\njury with an understandable instruction, something that’s clear\nto a lay person.”\n\n   One cannot fault the district court’s analysis.1 The proposed\ninstruction deviates from the Supreme Court’s formulation of\nthe standard of deliberate indifference in Farmer, and the dis-\ntrict court rightly concluded it might be confusing to a lay\njury.\n\n   The language sought by the government not only departed\nfrom the proper and time-tested definition of deliberate indif-\nference, but also would have imported language that the\nSupreme Court has held is not proper for such cases. The def-\nerence language requested by defendants appears verbatim in\nthe model Ninth Circuit jury instruction for prisoner excessive\n   1\n     Indeed, by providing instructions defining deliberate indifference in\nFarmer’s terms, rather than using the current version of the Ninth Circuit\nModel Jury Instruction, the trial judge actually avoided error on another\nfront. See Clem v. Lomeli, No. 07-16764, slip op. at 6574-75 (9th Cir. June\n2, 2009) (holding that district court erred in providing current Ninth Cir-\ncuit Model Jury Instruction 9.25 because the instruction deviates from\nFarmer, which does not require “direct causation by affirmative action”\nof prison officials); id. at 6577 (emphasizing that current Ninth Circuit\nModel Jury Instruction 9.25 does not adequately state the law because it\nnever “mentions or defines the term ‘deliberate indifference’ ”) (Hug, J.,\nconcurring).\n\f8512                      NORWOOD v. VANCE\nforce claims, in which the heightened subjective culpability\nstandard set forth in Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 321-22\n(1986), applies.2 See Ninth Circuit Manual of Model Jury\nInstructions § 9.24 (2007 ed.).\n\n   However, the Whitley excessive force standard, under\nwhich prison officials may be held liable only if they act “ma-\nliciously or sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm,”\nWhitley, 475 U.S. at 321-22 (citation omitted), does not apply\nto claims challenging prison conditions. Indeed, our precedent\nforecloses such an application, and defendants do not argue\notherwise. In Johnson v. Lewis, 217 F.3d 726 (2000), we held\nthat where prisoners were held handcuffed and prone in a\nprison yard for four days after a riot, the heightened culpabil-\nity standard announced in Whitley applied to the prison offi-\ncials’ actions up to the point when the inmates were secured,\nbut that once the prison officials “were no longer required to\nmake split-second, life-and-death decisions,” the deliberate\nindifference standard applied. Id. at 734; see also Jordan v.\nGardner, 986 F.2d 1521, 1528 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc)\n(Whitley’s “maliciously or sadistically” standard applies “in\nthe context of a prison-wide disturbance or individual con-\nfrontation between an officer and prisoner,” when “correc-\ntions officers must act immediately and emphatically to defuse\na potentially explosive situation”) (emphasis added). As we\nexplained in Jordan, the excessive force test involves the\nexamination of “the exercise of judgment of a particular offi-\ncer on a specific occasion,” while the deliberate indifference\ntest generally involves “polic[ies] . . . developed over time,\nwith ample opportunity for reflection.” Jordan, 986 F.2d at\n1528.\n  2\n   It is questionable whether this deference language is even properly\nincluded in jury instructions for excessive force cases. See Catherine T.\nStruve, Constitutional Decision Rules for Juries, 37 COLUM. HUM. RTS. L.\nREV. 659, 679 (2006) (arguing that including deference language in exces-\nsive force jury instruction double counts the deference due prison officials\nbecause the Whitley standard already incorporates deference).\n\f                           NORWOOD v. VANCE                            8513\n   The language that the government proposed in this case\nwould have effectively imposed the more deferential standard\nwe held inapplicable in Johnson and Jordan. The standards\nfor excessive force claims are not coextensive with the stan-\ndards applicable to prison conditions claims. In my view, not\nonly was the trial judge justified in rejecting the instruction,\nthe judge would have committed error if he had given it.\n\n   Defendants contend that the deliberate indifference stan-\ndard “did not capture the importance of deferring to the expert\njudgment of prison officials concerning when outdoor exer-\ncise could safely be resumed.” However, contrary to defen-\ndants’ assertion, the deliberate indifference standard\nannounced in Farmer and adopted by the trial judge in his\ninstructions is a “standard that incorporates due regard for\nprison officials’ ‘unenviable task of keeping dangerous men\nin safe custody under humane conditions.’ ” Farmer, 511 U.S.\nat 845 (emphasis added) (citing Spain, 600 F.2d at 193). The\nSupreme Court in Farmer also cited its decision in Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), in support of the iteration of the\ndeliberate indifference standard it adopted, indicating that the\nprinciple of deference to the judgment of prison officials\nundergirds the standard.3 See id. It is a mistake to confuse the\ndeference language surrounding the Supreme Court’s\nannouncement of the applicable standards in Whitley and\nFarmer with the standards themselves. See Catherine T.\nStruve, Constitutional Decision Rules for Juries, 37 COLUM.\nHUM. RTS. L. REV. 659, 679 (2006) (noting that deference lan-\n  3\n   The majority argues that the requested instruction was required\nbecause its language was drawn from Bell, a case that involved a chal-\nlenge to conditions of confinement, albeit in the pretrial detention context.\nHowever, Bell preceded the line of Supreme Court cases setting forth the\ncurrent standards applicable to prison conditions cases—including the\ndeliberate indifference standard. The deliberate indifference standard\nincorporates the level of deference the Court has deemed warranted in the\ncontext of challenges to prison conditions under the Eighth Amendment,\nas opposed to challenges to prison policies and practices under generally\napplicable constitutional provisions.\n\f8514                   NORWOOD v. VANCE\nguage in Whitley “explain[s] the Court’s choice of decision\nrule, but need not be seen as a part of that decision rule”).\n\n   An instruction incorporating further deference would run\nafoul of the Supreme Court’s rejection of such an approach in\nJohnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499 (2005). In Johnson, the\nCourt expressly disavowed the applicability in the Eighth\nAmendment context of the standard articulated in Turner v.\nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987), namely that a “regulation is\nvalid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological inter-\nests.” The Court reasoned that “the integrity of the criminal\njustice system depends on full compliance with the Eighth\nAmendment.” Johnson, 543 U.S. at 511. In support of this\nassertion, the Court quoted with approval the following pas-\nsage from Justice Kennedy’s decision for this Court in Spain:\n\n    [T]he full protections of the eighth amendment most\n    certainly remain in force [in prison]. The whole\n    point of the amendment is to protect persons con-\n    victed of crimes. . . . Mechanical deference to the\n    findings of state prison officials in the context of the\n    eighth amendment would reduce that provision to a\n    nullity in precisely the context where it is most nec-\n    essary.\n\nId. (quoting Spain, 600 F.2d at 194). Inclusion of the\nrequested deference instruction, in light of the fact that the\nappropriate level of deference was already incorporated in the\nculpability standard, would have invited exactly the sort of\n“mechanical deference” the Supreme Court has rejected.\n\n   Further, Farmer suggests that it is judges at whom the def-\nerence language in the Bell line of cases is directed, and\njudges who must be mindful of the respective competencies\nof the judiciary and executive branches. See Farmer, 511 U.S.\nat 846-47 (noting that district courts should approach grant of\ninjunctive relief in prison conditions cases with caution lest\nthey become “enmeshed in the minutiae of prison opera-\n\f                           NORWOOD v. VANCE                              8515\ntions”) (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 562). Farmer does not sug-\ngest that this complex balancing of competing institutional\ninterests should be placed directly in the hands of jurors. See\nStruve, supra, at 681-82 (arguing that not all judicial decision\nrules are appropriate for use as decision rules for juries).\nWhile juries, as part of the judicial branch, no doubt have an\nindirect role to play in this balancing process, they properly\nplay this role by applying the standards the Supreme Court\nhas determined strike the appropriate balance. The district\ncourt in this case accurately instructed the jury on those stan-\ndards. In doing so, the district court in this case wisely recog-\nnized that not every general legal principle “lifted from the\ncase law” is properly provided as instruction to the jury. The\ncourt correctly concluded that to give the government’s dou-\nble deference instruction would have been confusing to a lay\njury.4\n  4\n    The majority criticizes the trial judge on this point, contending that def-\nerence is a commonly understood lay term, and could not have been con-\nfusing. However, its citation of language in the novel Airframe illustrates\nthe problem. Instructing a jury to give prison officials deference, if defer-\nence commonly “borders on fear,” is not a correct application of the law\nand would have amounted to directing a verdict in favor of the govern-\nment. Even in our sterile legal environment, deference comes in varietals,\nsuch as Chevron deference, Skidmore deference, and sardonic deference.\nSee, e.g., Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 208 (1964) (White, J.,\ndissenting) (“With all due deference, I am not at all convinced that the\nadditional barriers to the pursuit of truth which the Court today erects rest\non anything like the solid foundations which decisions of this gravity\nshould require.”). And, of course, there is more than one breed of institu-\ntional deference relevant to this case. See, e.g., McCord v. Maguire, 873\nF.2d 1271, 1274 (9th Cir. 1989) (correctly noting that we must be “mind-\nful of the deference due the verdict of a jury”) (citation omitted). Here, the\ntrial judge quite rightly concluded that to give an instruction that mixed\nlegal standards and, in effect, told the jury to layer deference upon defer-\nence, was not appropriate—particularly when the judge had already given\nan entirely proper instruction on the topic. (I must, however, acknowledge\nthat the majority is quite correct in intuiting that, unsurprisingly, there is\nno Klingon word for “deference.” See generally Marc Okrand, THE\nKLINGON DICTIONARY (Star Trek 1992)).\n\f8516                        NORWOOD v. VANCE\n   Because the relevant level of deference is already incorpo-\nrated into the content of the culpability standards governing\nthe conduct of prison officials, the district court correctly\nrejected the instruction. The requested instruction misstated\napplicable law and, as the district court properly concluded,\nwould have been confusing to the jury. Moreover, everyone\nagrees that the primary instruction given by the judge on this\nissue was entirely proper. The trial judge properly rejected the\ndefendants’ proffered “deference” instruction, in favor of an\ninstruction that everyone agrees correctly stated the applicable\nlaw.5\n\n                                       II\n\n   The government did not preserve its qualified immunity\ndefense for appeal. The rules for preserving a qualified immu-\nnity defense are straightforward. Qualified immunity is an\naffirmative defense that must be pleaded in the answer. Sie-\ngert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 231 (1991). However, “defen-\ndants may raise an affirmative defense for the first time in a\nmotion for summary judgment . . . if the delay does not preju-\ndice the plaintiff.” Magana v. Commonwealth of N. Mariana\nIslands, 107 F.3d 1436, 1446 (9th Cir. 1997).\n   5\n     Although I have elected to discuss this issue on the merits, there is con-\nsiderable force to the plaintiff’s argument that the government failed to\npreserve the question for appeal. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(1)(B), a\nparty may assign as error “a failure to give an instruction, if that party\nproperly requested it and—unless the court rejected the request in a defini-\ntive ruling on the record—also properly objected.” (emphasis added). As\nI have noted, at the conference at which the instructions were discussed,\nthe trial judge indicated that he found the government’s proposed instruc-\ntion confusing and indicated that he was not inclined to give it. However,\nhe also stated, “at this juncture, you may have an opportunity to show me\nthat I’m wrong later, I think the plaintiff’s position is correct.” At the criti-\ncal moment in the trial, when the judge asked for objections to the instruc-\ntions as given, the government stated that it “will not object to any of the\ninstructions” except to “renew the defendants’ request for failure to miti-\ngate.” The government did not, at the critical juncture when formal objec-\ntions were to be made, request that the court give the additional deference\ninstruction.\n\f                        NORWOOD v. VANCE                       8517\n   If the district court denies qualified immunity on a sum-\nmary judgment motion, the order is immediately appealable\nas a collateral order if the judgment is made as a matter of law\nand “the issue appealed concerns whether the facts demon-\nstrated a violation of clearly established law.” Rodis v. City\nand County of San Francisco, 558 F.3d 964, 968 (9th Cir.\n2009) (citation omitted). If the district court denies summary\njudgment on qualified immunity because there remain genu-\nine issues of material fact, then there is no right of interlocu-\ntory appeal, because such an order is not a “final, immediately\nappealable order.” Maropulos v. County of Los Angeles, 560\nF.3d 974, 975 (9th Cir. 2009) (per curiam); see also KRL v.\nEstate of Moore, 512 F.3d 1184, 1188-89 (9th Cir. 2008)\n(“Our jurisdiction is limited to questions of law, and does not\nextend to qualified immunity claims involving disputed issues\nof material fact.”).\n\n   If the district court denies qualified immunity because there\nare genuine issues of material fact, then the case proceeds to\ntrial. “When a qualified immunity claim cannot be resolved\nbefore trial due to a factual conflict, it is a litigant’s responsi-\nbility to preserve the legal issue for determination after the\njury resolves the factual conflict.” Tortu v. Las Vegas Metro.\nPolice Dep’t., 556 F.3d 1075, 1083 (9th Cir. 2009). To pre-\nserve the issue of qualified immunity, the defendants must\nmake a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 50(a). Id. The Rule 50(a) motion must be filed “at any\ntime before the case is submitted to the jury.” Id. at 1081. A\nparty may also renew the motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw based on qualified immunity after trial under Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 50(b). However, a “failure to file a Rule 50(a) motion pre-\ncludes consideration of a Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as\na matter of law.” Id. at 1083. Filing a motion for summary\njudgment or raising the issue in pre-trial submissions is not\nsufficient to avoid a waiver. Id. at 1082.\n\n   Here, defendants raised qualified immunity as an affirma-\ntive defense and moved for summary judgment. The district\n\f8518                      NORWOOD v. VANCE\ncourt denied summary judgment because there were genuine\nissues of material fact. In their pretrial statement, defendants\nacknowledged that their motion for qualified immunity had\nbeen denied based on the existence of material factual dis-\nputes and stated that their “entitlement to qualified immunity\nat trial will depend on what evidence is produced to the court\nfor determination of this issue.”\n\n   The case proceeded to trial. Defendants did not request that\nthe judge give any instructions to the jury pertinent to the\nimmunity defense. Defendants did not file a Rule 50(a)\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law before the case was\nsubmitted to the jury. Nor did defendants file a renewed\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b)\nafter the verdict was rendered. In fact, after a jury was seated,\nthe issue of qualified immunity was never mentioned again in\nthe district court. At oral argument, defendants conceded that\nthey provided the district court no opportunity to rule on the\nquestion whether, on the facts established at trial, they were\nentitled to qualified immunity. Defendants offered no argu-\nment or explanation as to why the issue should not be deemed\nforfeited. Plainly, defendants did not preserve their post-trial\nassertion of qualified immunity for appeal. Under Tortu, the\ngovernment has forfeited its qualified immunity defense, and\nwe should not consider it for the first time on appeal.\n\n   The majority quite rightly notes that the plaintiff did not\nraise the issue of waiver in its appellate briefing, which was\na serious omission. That omission places the question of\nwhether to entertain the government’s belated qualified\nimmunity argument within our sound discretion. I would not\nchoose to exercise such discretion.6 By entertaining an appeal\n  6\n    We have never held that we must reach the merits of an immunity\ndefense abandoned by the government below when the plaintiff fails to\nargue waiver in the briefs. While the majority cites several of our cases\nfor the proposition that the Court does not address waiver if not raised by\nthe opposing party, none of these cases involved a party’s failure to raise\n\f                          NORWOOD v. VANCE                            8519\nbased on a defense abandoned at trial, we impose on trial\njudges the untenable duty of sua sponte re-examining a jury\nverdict in light of abandoned defenses. The Rules set forth the\nprocedure for raising legal challenges to jury verdicts: making\na motion for judgment as a matter of law. The requirement is\ncritical not only to the structure of the adversary system, but\nto our appellate system in which the trial court considers legal\narguments in the first instance. There are, of course, excep-\ntions to this general rule and, from time to time, we have\nindulged new legal arguments for the first time on appeal.\nHowever, I would not make an exception in this case with the\neffect of imposing a new duty on the trial court sua sponte to\nconsider abandoned defenses after the jury has issued its ver-\ndict.\n\n                                    III\n\n   Assuming that the question of qualified immunity is prop-\nerly before us, I would hold under the circumstances pre-\nsented here that a reasonable officer could not have believed\nthe exercise deprivations in this case were lawful. Because the\ngovernment did not preserve the issue for appeal, we review\n\nproperly a defense to liability in the trial court. See Tokatly v. Ashcroft,\n371 F.3d 613, 618 (9th Cir. 2004) (government waived argument that peti-\ntioner had waived argument before the immigration judge); United States\nv. Garcia-Lopez, 309 F.3d 1121, 1123 (9th Cir. 2002) (government\nexpressly waived argument that defendant had waived his right to appeal\nas part of plea agreement); United States v. Doe, 53 F.3d 1081, 1082-83\n(9th Cir. 1995) (where government urged court at oral argument to decide\nissue on merits, argument that defendant had waived challenge to sentence\nby not raising it on direct appeal was waived); United States v. Lewis, 787\nF.2d 1318, 1323 n.6 (9th Cir. 1986) (court declined to address govern-\nment’s argument, raised for the first time in petition for rehearing, that\ndefendant had waived instructional error argument in trial court). Because\ndeciding in the first instance the applicability of an abandoned defense to\nliability after a general jury verdict implicates concerns not present in\nthese cases, I would not extend the “waiver of waiver” principle to this\nnew context.\n\f8520                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\nthe claim under the familiar plain error standard. To prevail\non plain error review, the government must show (1) that the\nproceedings below involved error, (2) that the error is plain,\nand (3) that the error affected the substantial rights of the\naggrieved party. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-35\n(1993). In addition, the government must also show that the\nalleged error—here, the trial judge’s failure, after the evi-\ndence was presented, sua sponte to enter judgment as a matter\nof law for defendants based on qualified immunity—\n“ ‘seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputa-\ntion of judicial proceedings’ before we will exercise our dis-\ncretion pursuant to Rule 52(b) to correct the plain error.”\nUnited States v. Alferahin, 433 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.\n2006) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   To prevail on his Eighth Amendment prison conditions\nclaim, Norwood had to establish that he was subjected to an\nobjectively serious deprivation and thatprison officials were\ndeliberately indifferent to his health or safety. Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 834; Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 303 (1991). As\nthe trial judge correctly instructed the jury, and defendants\nconceded in their pretrial statement, the complete denial of\noutdoor exercise for periods of up to four and one-half months\nsatisfies the objective prong of the Farmer test. Indeed, it was\nclearly established at the time of the lockdowns involved in\nthis case that the complete deprivation of outdoor exercise for\nperiods of two to four and one-half months constituted an\nobjectively serious deprivation for purposes of the Eighth\nAmendment.\n\n   Thirty years ago, we recognized that “some form of regular\noutdoor exercise is extremely important to the psychological\nand physical well being of the inmates.” Spain v. Procunier,\n600 F.2d 189, 199 (9th Cir. 1979). In Spain, we held that\ninmates classified as dangerous due to violent acts in prison\nand confined to a disciplinary unit were entitled to regular\noutdoor exercise. Subsequent cases in our circuit clearly\nestablish that the denial of outside exercise for extended peri-\n\f                      NORWOOD v. VANCE                     8521\nods “is a sufficiently serious deprivation and thus meets the\nrequisite harm necessary to satisfy Wilson’s objective test.”\nLeMaire v. Maass, 12 F.3d 1444, 1457 (9th Cir. 1993). In\nLeMaire we noted that “this circuit has determined that the\nlong-term denial of outside exercise is unconstitutional” but\nfound no violation where a prisoner had both “abused [his\noutdoor exercise privileges] and represent[ed] a grave security\nrisk when outside his cell.” Id. at 1458. Shortly after LeMaire,\nin Allen v. Sakai, 40 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir. 1994), we held that\nprison officials were not entitled to summary judgment on\ngrounds of qualified immunity where the plaintiff prisoner\nwas provided only 45 minutes of exercise per week during a\nsix-week period. We stated that in light of our prior cases, “it\nshould have been apparent to defendants that they were\nrequired to provide regular outdoor exercise to [the plaintiff]\nunless ‘inclement weather, unusual circumstances, or disci-\nplinary needs made that impossible.’ ” Id. at 1004 (citing\nSpain, 600 F.2d at 199). And, while we noted in May v. Bald-\nwin, 109 F.3d 557 (9th Cir. 1997), that “a temporary denial\nof exercise with no medical effects is not a substantial depri-\nvation,” id. at 565, May involved the denial of exercise for\nonly 21 days as opposed to the four deprivations of two to\nfour-and-one-half months in this case, totaling more than a\nyear out of a period of less than two years.\n\n   We have held that in cases of genuine emergency, the tem-\nporary deprivation of outdoor exercise may not violate the\nEighth Amendment. In Hayward v. Procunier, 629 F.2d 599\n(9th Cir. 1980), we upheld a district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to prison officials but specifically noted that the\nlockdown was “temporary and plaintiffs . . . were allowed\napproximately the minimum exercise mandated in Spain\nwithin a month after the imposition of the lockdown.” Id. at\n603. We premised our holding on the fact that the district\ncourt had “carefully reviewed the restrictions of the lockdown\nin light of the emergency at the prison and determined that\nthey did not cross the eighth amendment line.” Id. Similarly,\nin Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237 (9th Cir. 1982), after not-\n\f8522                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\ning that “when a genuine emergency exists, prison officials\nmay be more restrictive than they otherwise may be, and cer-\ntain services may be suspended temporarily,” id. at 1259\n(emphasis added), we remanded to the district court to con-\nsider “the length of time each restriction was in effect, and\nwhether the restriction and its duration bore a relationship to\nlegitimate attempts to ease the emergency.” Id.\n\n   In this case, the magistrate judge denied summary judg-\nment for defendants on the grounds that there were genuine\nissues of fact regarding whether an emergency necessitated\nthe months-long complete deprivations of outdoor exercise in\nthis case. The magistrate judge also found a genuine issue of\nfact existed as to whether during these periods other arrange-\nments for outdoor exercise were feasible—for example, in\nsmall groups on the smaller concrete yards. Finally, the mag-\nistrate judge found disputed facts regarding defendants’ repre-\nsentation that an extended lockdown depriving all inmates of\nphysical exercise was called for where violence was precipi-\ntated by identifiable groups. In short, the magistrate judge\nfound that these factual issues—material to both the deliberate\nindifference and qualified immunity inquiries—were dis-\nputed. The precise circumstances surrounding the continua-\ntion of the four lockdowns without any arrangements for\noutdoor exercise were deemed issues of fact for trial.\n\n   The case proceeded to trial before a jury, and the jury heard\ntestimony from defendants describing the circumstances sur-\nrounding the decisions to continue the total lockdowns, the\nfeasibility of providing outdoor exercise in smaller groups on\nthe mini-yards, and the officers’ opinions as to the harmful-\nness of exercise deprivation. After hearing all the evidence,\nthe jury found that the defendants had been deliberately indif-\nferent in failing to provide Norwood access to outdoor exer-\ncise during each of the four lockdown periods. Furthermore,\nthe jury determined that Norwood was entitled to punitive\ndamages. To do so, the jury had to find that the defendants\nwere not merely deliberately indifferent to the risk to Nor-\n\f                          NORWOOD v. VANCE                           8523\nwood’s health posed by the deprivation of outdoor exercise,\nbut that defendants’ conduct was “malicious, or in reckless\ndisregard of plaintiff’s rights.”\n\n   In determining whether the facts established entitle defen-\ndants to qualified immunity, “the party that prevailed at trial\nis entitled to have the evidence construed in a light most\nfavorable to it, and the question is whether the evidence was\nso one-sided that one party would have to prevail as a matter\nof law.” Thompson v. Mahre, 110 F.3d 716, 721 (9th Cir.\n1997) (citing Air-Sea Forwarders, Inc. v. Air Asia Co., 880\nF.2d 176, 181 (9th Cir. 1989)); see also Jennings v. Jones,\n499 F.3d 2, 7 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding that where defendants\npress qualified immunity after a general jury verdict, the court\nis required to view facts relevant to qualified immunity deter-\nmination “in the light most favorable to the verdict”). Here,\nthe jury found defendants acted not merely with deliberate\nindifference to Norwood’s right to outdoor exercise, but with\nreckless disregard for it. The evidence viewed in light of that\nfinding does not support a defense of qualified immunity,\nwhich requires that defendants reasonably believed their con-\nduct to be lawful.\n\n   The government relies on a number of factual claims that\nwere disputed at trial, and which the verdict indicates the jury\nrejected. For example, the government asserts that after the\nlockdowns, the officials gradually eased restrictions “based on\nwhat they learned.” In fact, the jury heard testimony from\nprison officials that they “never even received anonymous\ninformation that a group, or any specific . . . inmate was\ninvolved in these plots to assault staff other than the perpetra-\ntors” who were identified on the day of the first two attacks.\nThe jury also heard evidence that contradicted prison offi-\ncials’ statements that they did not know if other inmates,\nincluding inmates of other races, were responsible for the first\nattack.7 Finally, with regard to the attack precipitating the\n   7\n     With regard to the first attack on staff by Hispanic inmates, Norwood\ntendered evidence that staff “believed it was likely that the Southern His-\npanics had put a hit out on staff” and that, generally speaking, Southern\nHispanic and black inmates were unlikely to form alliances.\n\f8524                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\nfourth lockdown, Norwood tendered evidence that prison offi-\ncials knew shortly after—and perhaps before—the attack that\nthe lone perpetrator, a Crip gang member, had specifically tar-\ngeted the staff member who was attacked and was already on\nlockdown status at the time of the attack because prison staff\nhad information that Crip inmates were going to assault some-\none in the facility.\n\n   Similarly, the government notes that Norwood, who was\nnot affiliated with any prison gangs, was locked down after\nthe attacks instigated by known gang members because “gang\nmembers often pressured unaffiliated inmates of the same eth-\nnicity to assist them.” However, Norwood tendered evidence\n—in the form of numerous memoranda from prison officials\nto staff and inmates—that the usual course of action after a\nviolent incident was to lock down those inmates closely iden-\ntified with the group to which the attacker belonged, for\nexample, Crip inmates in the case of an incident involving\nCrips. Furthermore, Defendant Pliler conceded that pressuring\nand violence among races and gangs occur during normal pro-\ngramming and that “[t]hat’s the nature of the prisoner at the\nprison.”\n\n   The majority claims that the fact that defendants imposed\ngeneral lockdowns after attacks on staff but only group-\nspecific restrictions after attacks on inmates “does not show\nmalicious intent or deliberate indifference.” The majority also\nstates that “plaintiff offered no evidence that the lockdowns\nwere meant to be punitive or were otherwise implemented in\nbad faith.” However, the jury thought otherwise, rejecting the\ndefendants’ testimony that the exercise deprivations were\nmotivated primarily by the officials’ concerns for safety and\nsecurity.\n\n  Finally, the majority suggests that defendants reasonably\ndecided to continue the lockdowns given the occurrence of\nviolent incidents during and after lockdown periods. How-\never, defendants conceded on cross-examination that “those\n\f                      NORWOOD v. VANCE                      8525\ntypes of incidents occur even when there is no lockdown”\nwith the same frequency, and that “the violence is pretty\nsteady.” Thus, the jury reasonably rejected defendants’ argu-\nment that they believed the unusual levels of violence justi-\nfied the long-term deprivations in this case. Indeed,\ndefendants’ argument that the circumstances here were “un-\nusual” and excused the exercise deprivation is belied by the\nlength of the lockdowns, which persisted for periods totaling\nover one year out of a twenty-two month period.\n\n   In sum, the evidence as to the necessity of the long-term\nexercise deprivations at issue in this case, viewed in light of\nthe jury verdict for Norwood, does not provide a sufficient\nbasis for determining, as a matter of law, that defendants were\nentitled to qualified immunity. The alleged error of the trial\njudge in failing sua sponte to grant qualified immunity cer-\ntainly does not rise to the level of plain error. The district\ncourt did not commit error—much less a plain error—and it\nwould be hard to imagine a trial court decision less likely to\n“seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\njudicial proceedings” than a decision not to give a jury\ninstruction that the trial judge determined would be confusing\nto the jury. Thus, if I were to reach the merits of the qualified\nimmunity defense, I would affirm the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n\n                               IV\n\n   The district court correctly applied the law and instructed\nthe jury according to controlling precedent. The jury, after\nhearing a full evidentiary presentation, rejected the defen-\ndants’ justification. The government failed to preserve the\ndefense of qualified immunity for appeal. Indeed, the govern-\nment did not even mention the affirmative defense after the\njury was seated, much less make the appropriate motion to\npresent the question to the district court for its consideration.\nThe district court did not commit error, much less plain error,\nin not sua sponte granting judgment as a matter of law after\n\f8526                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\ntrial based on an abandoned affirmative defense. There is no\njustification for overturning the jury’s verdict.\n\n  I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

Norwood brought this section 1983\naction alleging that prison officials violated the Eighth\nAmendment when they denied him outdoor exercise during\nfour separate extended lockdowns over the course of two\nyears.\n\n   The prison initiated these lockdowns after serious inmate\nassaults on staff. During the lockdowns, inmates were con-\nfined to their cells and normal programs were suspended\nwhile officials investigated the violence. Based on what they\nlearned, officials gradually eased restrictions on specific\ngangs, ethnic and racial groups, restoring outdoor exercise\nsooner for inmates who they believed would pose less risk of\nfurther violence. Norwood was not a gang member, but gang\n\f8498                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\nmembers often pressured unaffiliated inmates of the same\nrace or ethnicity to assist them. Prison officials therefore\nbelieved that limiting the scope of lockdowns to gang mem-\nbers would be inadequate to ensure safety.\n\n   During this two-year period, there were also numerous\ninmate-on-inmate attacks. Officials did not always initiate\ntotal lockdowns after such attacks. According to one defen-\ndant, the prison’s response to inmate-on-inmate violence\n“[d]epends on the circumstances of the assault. . . . [I]f it’s\nfisticuffs, and it’s a one-on-one situation, no, we wouldn’t\nlock down for that. If it’s a slashing assault, or a stomping, or\nmultiple inmates involved in a melee, then yes, we would lock\ndown . . . .”\n\n   Officials initiated the first lockdown in early 2002 after\neleven Hispanic inmates attacked four correctional officers,\nnearly killing one of them. Prison officials didn’t know if the\nattack was planned or isolated. They also didn’t know, and\nwere never able to ascertain, who provided the weapons. The\nweeks following the attack brought a series of inmate-on-\ninmate attacks, including a homicide, as well as another\nattempted murder of an officer. Officials eventually decided\nit was safe to begin restoring normal programs, beginning\nwith “critical workers.” Norwood was in the second group of\nworkers to resume outdoor exercise. His exercise had been\nsuspended for about three months.\n\n   In early May, a black inmate stabbed an officer in a dining\nhall. Officials initiated a second lockdown but began restoring\nnormal programs by the end of the month. By mid-July, pris-\noners other than blacks had resumed outdoor exercise. Even\nso, attacks on officers occurred during this lockdown, includ-\ning a battery and an attempted battery. Norwood, who is\nblack, was denied exercise for three months.\n\n In the waning days of 2002, black inmates attempted to\nmurder a correctional officer, and a number of black Crips\n\f                      NORWOOD v. VANCE                       8499\nattacked staff members. Officials initiated a third lockdown,\nduring the course of which inmates committed four batteries\nor attempted batteries of officers and five batteries or\nattempted murders of inmates. During this lockdown, Nor-\nwood’s outdoor exercise was suspended for four and a half\nmonths.\n\n   In September of 2003, a black Crip attempted to murder an\nofficer. Because of the seriousness of the incident and the fact\nthat it was the fourth major assault on staff in a 19-month\nperiod, officers locked down all inmates and declared a state\nof emergency. Officers eventually determined that the\nattacker had acted alone and began restoring outdoor exercise.\nBut the violence continued. Certain white inmates, and those\ncelled with them, were locked down because of an attempted\nmurder of an inmate in November, and certain Crips and their\ncellmates remained on lockdown from earlier violence. Nor-\nwood was denied outdoor exercise for two months.\n\n  A jury found that defendants violated Norwood’s Eighth\nAmendment right to outdoor exercise but concluded that Nor-\nwood suffered no harm and thus awarded no compensatory\ndamages. The jury did award $11 in nominal damages and\n$39,000 in punitive damages. The district court awarded\n$23,875.55 in attorney’s fees. Defendants appeal.\n\n                           Analysis\n\n                               I\n\n  Defendants claim the district court erred by refusing to give\nthe following jury instruction:\n\n    In considering whether defendants were deliberately\n    indifferent to the need for outdoor exercise, the jury\n    should consider that defendants had a competing\n    obligation under the Eighth Amendment to ensure\n    the safety of prisoners, including protecting prison-\n\f8500                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\n    ers from each other. In considering these factors, you\n    should give deference to prison officials in the adop-\n    tion and execution of policies and practices that in\n    their judgment are needed to preserve discipline and\n    to maintain internal security in a prison.\n\nThe district court initially agreed to the language but, after\nplaintiff objected, declined to include it on the ground that\n“deference” was “undefined.” Because defendants challenge\nthe resulting jury instruction as an incomplete, and therefore\nincorrect, statement of the law our review is de novo. Clem\nv. Lomeli, No. 07-16764, slip op. at 6572 (9th Cir. June 2,\n2009); Dang v.

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(2). But the record\nshows that defendants contested the district court’s decision\nnot to include the proposed language and made the grounds\nfor their position clear, citing relevant authority.

See, e.g., Michael Crichton, Airframe 78\n(1996) (“[S]he certainly knew where all the bodies were bur-\nied. Within the company, she was treated with a deference\nbordering on fear.”).

But juries are not\nclairvoyant and will not know to defer unless they are told to\ndo so.\n\n   [3] We have long recognized that additional instruction\nregarding deference is required in cases applying Whitley to\nallegedly excessive force by prison officials. See Ninth Cir-\ncuit Manual of Model Jury Instructions § 9.24 (2007 ed.). The\ndissent accuses us of improperly extending the Whitley regime\nto a case involving conditions of confinement. Dissent at\n8511. But defendants’ proposed instruction was not drawn\nfrom Whitley; it was drawn from Bell—itself a conditions of\nconfinement case. Bell, 441 U.S. at 534, 547. Prison officials\nare entitled to deference whether a prisoner challenges exces-\nsive force or conditions of confinement. See Whitley, 475 U.S.\nat 322; Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845. Indeed, conditions of con-\nfinement and use of force are often flip sides of the same coin:\nA more restrictive confinement may diminish the need for\nforce and vice versa.\n\n   [4] As the government recognized at trial, the court’s\ninstruction correctly stated Farmer’s deliberate indifference\nstandard. But the court’s failure to give additional guidance\non deference rendered the instruction incomplete and mislead-\ning. And the error was also prejudicial. If properly instructed,\nthe jurors might well have reached a different conclusion.\nNorwood has not met his burden of showing the verdict\nwould “more probably than not” have been the same absent\nthe error. Clem, slip op. at 6575. We therefore vacate the\njury’s verdict and damages awards.\n\n                               II\n\n  We would normally remand for a new trial, but as defen-\ndants are entitled to qualified immunity that is not necessary\nhere.

Even if we had such discretion, we believe the\nmore prudent course is to resolve the case on the basis of the\nissues actually briefed and argued by the parties.\n\n   [6] When a party waives waiver, we proceed directly to the\nmerits.

Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity so long\nas a right to outdoor exercise in the midst of severe ongoing\nprison violence was not clearly established at the time defen-\n\f8504                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\ndants acted. See Saucier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201-02\n(2001). “The relevant, dispositive inquiry . . . is whether it\nwould be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was\nunlawful in the situation he confronted.” Id. at 202 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n   [7] Three factors weigh heavily in our analysis: First, as\nSaucier explains, the qualified immunity inquiry is highly\ncontext-sensitive, turning on whether it would be clear to a\nreasonable officer that denying outdoor exercise was unlawful\n“in the situation he confronted.” Id. The extraordinary vio-\nlence gripping the prison threatened staff and inmates alike,\nand there was a serious risk that gangs would press unaffili-\nated inmates like Norwood into service. See pp.8497-99\nsupra. While Norwood argues that a reasonable officer would\nhave known that denying outdoor exercise in the midst of\nongoing prison violence violated his rights, he cites just one\ncase Allen v. Sakai, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"690333\"><a href=\"/opinion/690333/john-allen-terry-smith-v-ted-sakai-harold-falk-john-cabral-clayton-frank/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1995)—for the\ngeneral proposition that the Ninth Circuit “is one of many\n[courts] that have held that there is a constitutional right to\noutdoor exercise for inmates.”\n\n   But Allen does not hold that a prisoner’s right to outdoor\nexercise is absolute and indefeasible, or that it trumps all\nother considerations. Plaintiffs in Allen survived summary\njudgment because prison officials there relied on “inconse-\nquential logistical concerns” to justify denying outdoor exer-\ncise. Id. at 1088. Defendants here had substantial reasons for\nimposing the lockdowns: They were attempting to restore\norder during a series of brutal attacks, some lethal or nearly\nso. They did not place “inconsequential logistical concerns”\nabove Norwood’s need for outdoor exercise. And plaintiff\noffered no evidence that the lockdowns were meant to be\npunitive or were otherwise implemented in bad faith.\n\n   [8] Second, prison officials have a duty to keep inmates\nsafe, and in particular to protect them from each other. Far-\nmer, 511 U.S. at 832-33; LeMaire v. Maass, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659878\"><a href=\"/opinion/659878/samuel-lemaire-v-manfred-maass-superintendent-samuel-lemaire-v-manfred/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1444</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\f                      NORWOOD v. VANCE                        8505\n1462 (9th Cir. 1993). Officials must balance this imperative\nagainst other obligations that our laws impose, such as provid-\ning outdoor exercise. When violence rises to unusually high\nlevels, prison officials can reasonably believe it is lawful to\ntemporarily restrict outdoor exercise to help bring the vio-\nlence under control. We’ve explained that “prison officials\nhave a right and a duty to take the necessary steps to reestab-\nlish order in a prison when such order is lost. This is for the\nbenefit of the prisoners as much as for the benefit of the\nprison officials.” Hoptowit v. Ray, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406187\"><a href=\"/opinion/406187/frederick-hoptowit-rick-rinier-steven-hopkins-david-rivera-robert/\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1259 (9th\nCir. 1982). Here, at least one prisoner had died; others (pris-\noners and guards) had been severely wounded. Defendants\nhad to act decisively to stop the violence.\n\n   The dissent claims that the “jury reasonably rejected defen-\ndants’ argument that unusual levels of violence justified the\nlong-term deprivations in this case” because “defendants con-\nceded on cross-examination that ‘those types of [violent] inci-\ndents occur even when there is no lockdown,’ with the same\nfrequency, and that ‘the violence is pretty steady.’ ” Dissent\nat 8524-25 (emphasis omitted). But there’s more to the former\nwarden’s testimony:\n\n    While we were on lockdown status, these types of\n    things continued to happen. Either as we incremen-\n    tally unlocked and released to the small yards for\n    exercise, or sent—you know, releasing—lifting the\n    privileges to go to meals or whatever, violence con-\n    tinued to happen. And if that violence was—\n    occurred based on a decision that we made that we\n    felt it was safe, and we let the small group of prison-\n    ers out and something happened, then we would call\n    back our prior decision. [Emphasis added.]\n\nWhat we understand the warden to be saying is that the lock-\ndowns were effective at curbing violence, and that violence\nresumed as privileges were restored.\n\f8506                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\n   Such decisions are not to be judged with the benefit of\nhindsight, in any event. It matters not whether the measures\ntaken actually worked but whether prison officials reasonably\nbelieved they would be effective in stopping the violence. At\nmost, prison officials here may be faulted for erring on the\nside of caution by maintaining lockdowns for longer than nec-\nessary. But, when it comes to matters of life and death, erring\non the side of caution is a virtue. Certainly, no officer could\nreasonably have anticipated that such prudence would be\nfound to violate the constitution.\n\n   [9] Third, when balancing the obligation to provide for\ninmate and staff safety against the duty to accord inmates the\nrights and privileges to which they are entitled, prison offi-\ncials are afforded “wide-ranging deference.” Bell, 441 U.S. at\n547. When a “lockdown was in response to a genuine emer-\ngency,” and “restrictions were eased as the prison administra-\ntion determined that the emergency permitted,” we may not\nlightly second-guess officials’ expert judgments about when\nexercise and other programs could safely be restored. “These\ndecisions are delicate ones, and those charged with them must\nbe given reasonable leeway.” Hayward v. Procunier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381859\"><a href=\"/opinion/381859/art-hayward-jr-michael-mcnabb-and-morris-l-brown-v-raymond-k/\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (9th Cir. 1980).\n\n   [10] It would be particularly odd to hold that liability\nattaches in this case, where hindsight validates defendants’\ndecisions. The record makes clear that a great deal of violence\ntook place during outdoor exercise. While denying outdoor\nexercise for extended periods carried some risk of harm, offi-\ncials’ judgment that there was a greater risk of harm from\nallowing outdoor exercise was certainly reasonable. Indeed,\nNorwood suffered no injuries from attacks by other inmates\nor from being denied outdoor exercise—a fact the jury recog-\nnized by awarding no compensatory damages. Norwood\nmight have fared less well had prison officials been less cau-\ntious. Although exercise is “one of the basic human necessi-\nties protected by the Eighth Amendment,” LeMaire, 12 F.3d\nat 1457, “a temporary denial of outdoor exercise with no med-\n\f                      NORWOOD v.

Norwood\nalso argues that defendants could have limited exercise\nrestrictions to specific groups of prisoners. But the investiga-\ntions were reasonable precautions, and defendants had no way\nof knowing beforehand what they would yield. That defen-\ndants imposed general lockdowns after some attacks on staff\nbut only group-specific restrictions after some attacks on\ninmates does not show malicious intent or deliberate indiffer-\nence. Attacks on staff are, by their nature, more serious chal-\nlenges to prison authority than attacks on other inmates.\n\n   [12] We decline Norwood’s invitation to micro-manage\nofficials whose expertise in prison administration far exceeds\n\f8508                  NORWOOD v.

Clearly established law\nprecludes prison officials from depriving inmates of outdoor\nexercise for extended periods absent exigent circumstances.\nThe jury’s finding that defendants acted with reckless disre-\ngard to the risk to Norwood’s health and safety leaves no\nroom to conclude defendants could reasonably have believed\ntheir actions lawful.\n\n  For these reasons, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n                                I\n\n   We afford trial judges “substantial latitude in tailoring jury\ninstructions.” Mockler v.

Here, there is no doubt\nthat the district court properly instructed the jury on the essen-\ntial elements of the claim at issue. Indeed, the government\nconcedes that the jury was properly instructed, and it did not\nobject to the instruction given by the district court. What the\ngovernment sought was an additional, misleading instruction\nthat would have engrafted supplemental requirements onto\nthose dictated by precedent. The district court found that the\nnew instruction was unclear, undefined, and used language\nthat would be confusing to a lay jury. A district court does not\ncommit error in rejecting a misleading supplementary instruc-\ntion that is at odds with a controlling instruction everyone\nagrees was properly given. “Jury instructions must be formu-\nlated so that they fairly and adequately cover the issues pre-\nsented, correctly state the law, and are not misleading.” Id.\n(citation omitted).\n\n   This case involved a challenge to prison conditions—\nspecifically, the long-term deprivation of outdoor exercise—\nto which the deliberate indifference standard applies. The jury\nwas instructed that:\n\n    To establish deliberate indifference plaintiff must\n    prove defendant knew that plaintiff faced a substan-\n    tial risk of serious harm to his health or safety and\n    disregarded that risk by failing to take reasonable\n    measures to correct it. Under the deliberate indiffer-\n    ence standard, defendant must have been aware of\n    facts from which the inference could be drawn that\n    a substantial risk of serious harm to plaintiff’s health\n    or safety existed due to deprivation of outdoor exer-\n    cise, and defendant must also have drawn that infer-\n    ence.\n\n   The jury was further instructed that “[a] defendant who\nactually knew of a substantial risk of a serious harm to plain-\ntiff’s health or safety may be found free from liability if he\nresponded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm was not\n\f8510                   NORWOOD v.

In combination with the\ninstruction that exercise did not have to be provided if “in-\nclement weather, unusual circumstances, or disciplinary needs\nmakes that impossible,” the instructions conveyed to the jury\nthat it could not find defendants liable if the officials knew of\nthe risk posed by continuing the lockdowns without providing\nfor exercise, but responded reasonably to that risk under the\ncircumstances.\n\n   The government agreed that the jury instruction that “exer-\ncise must be provided unless inclement weather, unusual cir-\ncumstances, or disciplinary needs makes that impossible” was\n“an adequate and proper statement of the law.” See Allen v.\nSakai, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682785\"><a href=\"/opinion/682785/john-allen-terry-smith-v-ted-sakai-harold-falk-john-cabral-clayton-frank/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1004 (1994) (stating that prison officials\nwere required to “provide regular outdoor exercise to [the\nplaintiff] unless ‘inclement weather, unusual circumstances,\nor disciplinary needs made that impossible’ ”) (quoting Spain\nv.

In considering these factors, you\n     should give deference to prison officials in the adop-\n     tion and execution of policies and practices that in\n     their judgment are needed to preserve discipline and\n     maintain internal stability in a prison.\n\nThe district court rejected the proffered jury instruction\nbecause he found the deference language unclear and unde-\nfined, noting that “one of my jobs as a judge is to provide the\njury with an understandable instruction, something that’s clear\nto a lay person.”\n\n   One cannot fault the district court’s analysis.1 The proposed\ninstruction deviates from the Supreme Court’s formulation of\nthe standard of deliberate indifference in Farmer, and the dis-\ntrict court rightly concluded it might be confusing to a lay\njury.\n\n   The language sought by the government not only departed\nfrom the proper and time-tested definition of deliberate indif-\nference, but also would have imported language that the\nSupreme Court has held is not proper for such cases. The def-\nerence language requested by defendants appears verbatim in\nthe model Ninth Circuit jury instruction for prisoner excessive\n   1\n     Indeed, by providing instructions defining deliberate indifference in\nFarmer’s terms, rather than using the current version of the Ninth Circuit\nModel Jury Instruction, the trial judge actually avoided error on another\nfront. See Clem v. Lomeli, No. 07-16764, slip op. at 6574-75 (9th Cir.

As we\nexplained in Jordan, the excessive force test involves the\nexamination of “the exercise of judgment of a particular offi-\ncer on a specific occasion,” while the deliberate indifference\ntest generally involves “polic[ies] . . . developed over time,\nwith ample opportunity for reflection.” Jordan, 986 F.2d at\n1528.\n  2\n   It is questionable whether this deference language is even properly\nincluded in jury instructions for excessive force cases.

The deliberate indifference standard\nincorporates the level of deference the Court has deemed warranted in the\ncontext of challenges to prison conditions under the Eighth Amendment,\nas opposed to challenges to prison policies and practices under generally\napplicable constitutional provisions.\n\f8514                   NORWOOD v. VANCE\nguage in Whitley “explain[s] the Court’s choice of decision\nrule, but need not be seen as a part of that decision rule”).\n\n   An instruction incorporating further deference would run\nafoul of the Supreme Court’s rejection of such an approach in\nJohnson v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137748\"><a href=\"/opinion/137748/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005). In Johnson, the\nCourt expressly disavowed the applicability in the Eighth\nAmendment context of the standard articulated in Turner v.\nSafley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89 (1987), namely that a “regulation is\nvalid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological inter-\nests.” The Court reasoned that “the integrity of the criminal\njustice system depends on full compliance with the Eighth\nAmendment.” Johnson, 543 U.S. at 511. In support of this\nassertion, the Court quoted with approval the following pas-\nsage from Justice Kennedy’s decision for this Court in Spain:\n\n    [T]he full protections of the eighth amendment most\n    certainly remain in force [in prison]. The whole\n    point of the amendment is to protect persons con-\n    victed of crimes. . . . Mechanical deference to the\n    findings of state prison officials in the context of the\n    eighth amendment would reduce that provision to a\n    nullity in precisely the context where it is most nec-\n    essary.\n\nId. (quoting Spain, 600 F.2d at 194). Inclusion of the\nrequested deference instruction, in light of the fact that the\nappropriate level of deference was already incorporated in the\nculpability standard, would have invited exactly the sort of\n“mechanical deference” the Supreme Court has rejected.\n\n   Further, Farmer suggests that it is judges at whom the def-\nerence language in the Bell line of cases is directed, and\njudges who must be mindful of the respective competencies\nof the judiciary and executive branches. See Farmer, 511 U.S.\nat 846-47 (noting that district courts should approach grant of\ninjunctive relief in prison conditions cases with caution lest\nthey become “enmeshed in the minutiae of prison opera-\n\f                           NORWOOD v. VANCE                              8515\ntions”) (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 562). Farmer does not sug-\ngest that this complex balancing of competing institutional\ninterests should be placed directly in the hands of jurors. See\nStruve, supra, at 681-82 (arguing that not all judicial decision\nrules are appropriate for use as decision rules for juries).\nWhile juries, as part of the judicial branch, no doubt have an\nindirect role to play in this balancing process, they properly\nplay this role by applying the standards the Supreme Court\nhas determined strike the appropriate balance. The district\ncourt in this case accurately instructed the jury on those stan-\ndards. In doing so, the district court in this case wisely recog-\nnized that not every general legal principle “lifted from the\ncase law” is properly provided as instruction to the jury. The\ncourt correctly concluded that to give the government’s dou-\nble deference instruction would have been confusing to a lay\njury.4\n  4\n    The majority criticizes the trial judge on this point, contending that def-\nerence is a commonly understood lay term, and could not have been con-\nfusing. However, its citation of language in the novel Airframe illustrates\nthe problem. Instructing a jury to give prison officials deference, if defer-\nence commonly “borders on fear,” is not a correct application of the law\nand would have amounted to directing a verdict in favor of the govern-\nment. Even in our sterile legal environment, deference comes in varietals,\nsuch as Chevron deference, Skidmore deference, and sardonic deference.\nSee, e.g., Massiah v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106822\"><a href=\"/opinion/106822/massiah-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 208 (1964) (White, J.,\ndissenting) (“With all due deference, I am not at all convinced that the\nadditional barriers to the pursuit of truth which the Court today erects rest\non anything like the solid foundations which decisions of this gravity\nshould require.”). And, of course, there is more than one breed of institu-\ntional deference relevant to this case. See, e.g., McCord v. Maguire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522286\"><a href=\"/opinion/522286/dorothy-r-mccord-v-john-patrick-maguire/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1274 (9th Cir. 1989) (correctly noting that we must be “mind-\nful of the deference due the verdict of a jury”) (citation omitted). Here, the\ntrial judge quite rightly concluded that to give an instruction that mixed\nlegal standards and, in effect, told the jury to layer deference upon defer-\nence, was not appropriate—particularly when the judge had already given\nan entirely proper instruction on the topic. (I must, however, acknowledge\nthat the majority is quite correct in intuiting that, unsurprisingly, there is\nno Klingon word for “deference.” See generally Marc Okrand, THE\nKLINGON DICTIONARY (Star Trek 1992)).\n\f8516                        NORWOOD v. VANCE\n   Because the relevant level of deference is already incorpo-\nrated into the content of the culpability standards governing\nthe conduct of prison officials, the district court correctly\nrejected the instruction. The requested instruction misstated\napplicable law and, as the district court properly concluded,\nwould have been confusing to the jury. Moreover, everyone\nagrees that the primary instruction given by the judge on this\nissue was entirely proper. The trial judge properly rejected the\ndefendants’ proffered “deference” instruction, in favor of an\ninstruction that everyone agrees correctly stated the applicable\nlaw.5\n\n                                       II\n\n   The government did not preserve its qualified immunity\ndefense for appeal. The rules for preserving a qualified immu-\nnity defense are straightforward. Qualified immunity is an\naffirmative defense that must be pleaded in the answer. Sie-\ngert v. Gilley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112594\"><a href=\"/opinion/112594/siegert-v-gilley/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 231 (1991). However, “defen-\ndants may raise an affirmative defense for the first time in a\nmotion for summary judgment . . . if the delay does not preju-\ndice the plaintiff.” Magana v. Commonwealth of N.

Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(1)(B), a\nparty may assign as error “a failure to give an instruction, if that party\nproperly requested it and—unless the court rejected the request in a defini-\ntive ruling on the record—also properly objected.” (emphasis added). As\nI have noted, at the conference at which the instructions were discussed,\nthe trial judge indicated that he found the government’s proposed instruc-\ntion confusing and indicated that he was not inclined to give it. However,\nhe also stated, “at this juncture, you may have an opportunity to show me\nthat I’m wrong later, I think the plaintiff’s position is correct.” At the criti-\ncal moment in the trial, when the judge asked for objections to the instruc-\ntions as given, the government stated that it “will not object to any of the\ninstructions” except to “renew the defendants’ request for failure to miti-\ngate.” The government did not, at the critical juncture when formal objec-\ntions were to be made, request that the court give the additional deference\ninstruction.\n\f                        NORWOOD v. VANCE                       8517\n   If the district court denies qualified immunity on a sum-\nmary judgment motion, the order is immediately appealable\nas a collateral order if the judgment is made as a matter of law\nand “the issue appealed concerns whether the facts demon-\nstrated a violation of clearly established law.” Rodis v.

To pre-\nserve the issue of qualified immunity, the defendants must\nmake a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 50(a). Id. The Rule 50(a) motion must be filed “at any\ntime before the case is submitted to the jury.” Id. at 1081. A\nparty may also renew the motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw based on qualified immunity after trial under Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 50(b). However, a “failure to file a Rule 50(a) motion pre-\ncludes consideration of a Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as\na matter of law.” Id. at 1083. Filing a motion for summary\njudgment or raising the issue in pre-trial submissions is not\nsufficient to avoid a waiver. Id. at 1082.\n\n   Here, defendants raised qualified immunity as an affirma-\ntive defense and moved for summary judgment. The district\n\f8518                      NORWOOD v. VANCE\ncourt denied summary judgment because there were genuine\nissues of material fact. In their pretrial statement, defendants\nacknowledged that their motion for qualified immunity had\nbeen denied based on the existence of material factual dis-\nputes and stated that their “entitlement to qualified immunity\nat trial will depend on what evidence is produced to the court\nfor determination of this issue.”\n\n   The case proceeded to trial. Defendants did not request that\nthe judge give any instructions to the jury pertinent to the\nimmunity defense. Defendants did not file a Rule 50(a)\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law before the case was\nsubmitted to the jury. Nor did defendants file a renewed\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b)\nafter the verdict was rendered. In fact, after a jury was seated,\nthe issue of qualified immunity was never mentioned again in\nthe district court. At oral argument, defendants conceded that\nthey provided the district court no opportunity to rule on the\nquestion whether, on the facts established at trial, they were\nentitled to qualified immunity. Defendants offered no argu-\nment or explanation as to why the issue should not be deemed\nforfeited. Plainly, defendants did not preserve their post-trial\nassertion of qualified immunity for appeal. Under Tortu, the\ngovernment has forfeited its qualified immunity defense, and\nwe should not consider it for the first time on appeal.\n\n   The majority quite rightly notes that the plaintiff did not\nraise the issue of waiver in its appellate briefing, which was\na serious omission. That omission places the question of\nwhether to entertain the government’s belated qualified\nimmunity argument within our sound discretion. I would not\nchoose to exercise such discretion.6 By entertaining an appeal\n  6\n    We have never held that we must reach the merits of an immunity\ndefense abandoned by the government below when the plaintiff fails to\nargue waiver in the briefs. While the majority cites several of our cases\nfor the proposition that the Court does not address waiver if not raised by\nthe opposing party, none of these cases involved a party’s failure to raise\n\f                          NORWOOD v.

The Rules set forth the\nprocedure for raising legal challenges to jury verdicts: making\na motion for judgment as a matter of law. The requirement is\ncritical not only to the structure of the adversary system, but\nto our appellate system in which the trial court considers legal\narguments in the first instance. There are, of course, excep-\ntions to this general rule and, from time to time, we have\nindulged new legal arguments for the first time on appeal.\nHowever, I would not make an exception in this case with the\neffect of imposing a new duty on the trial court sua sponte to\nconsider abandoned defenses after the jury has issued its ver-\ndict.\n\n                                    III\n\n   Assuming that the question of qualified immunity is prop-\nerly before us, I would hold under the circumstances pre-\nsented here that a reasonable officer could not have believed\nthe exercise deprivations in this case were lawful.

We premised our holding on the fact that the district\ncourt had “carefully reviewed the restrictions of the lockdown\nin light of the emergency at the prison and determined that\nthey did not cross the eighth amendment line.” Id.

VANCE\ning that “when a genuine emergency exists, prison officials\nmay be more restrictive than they otherwise may be, and cer-\ntain services may be suspended temporarily,” id. at 1259\n(emphasis added), we remanded to the district court to con-\nsider “the length of time each restriction was in effect, and\nwhether the restriction and its duration bore a relationship to\nlegitimate attempts to ease the emergency.” Id.\n\n   In this case, the magistrate judge denied summary judg-\nment for defendants on the grounds that there were genuine\nissues of fact regarding whether an emergency necessitated\nthe months-long complete deprivations of outdoor exercise in\nthis case. The magistrate judge also found a genuine issue of\nfact existed as to whether during these periods other arrange-\nments for outdoor exercise were feasible—for example, in\nsmall groups on the smaller concrete yards. Finally, the mag-\nistrate judge found disputed facts regarding defendants’ repre-\nsentation that an extended lockdown depriving all inmates of\nphysical exercise was called for where violence was precipi-\ntated by identifiable groups. In short, the magistrate judge\nfound that these factual issues—material to both the deliberate\nindifference and qualified immunity inquiries—were dis-\nputed. The precise circumstances surrounding the continua-\ntion of the four lockdowns without any arrangements for\noutdoor exercise were deemed issues of fact for trial.\n\n   The case proceeded to trial before a jury, and the jury heard\ntestimony from defendants describing the circumstances sur-\nrounding the decisions to continue the total lockdowns, the\nfeasibility of providing outdoor exercise in smaller groups on\nthe mini-yards, and the officers’ opinions as to the harmful-\nness of exercise deprivation. After hearing all the evidence,\nthe jury found that the defendants had been deliberately indif-\nferent in failing to provide Norwood access to outdoor exer-\ncise during each of the four lockdown periods. Furthermore,\nthe jury determined that Norwood was entitled to punitive\ndamages. To do so, the jury had to find that the defendants\nwere not merely deliberately indifferent to the risk to Nor-\n\f                          NORWOOD v.

Here,\nthe jury found defendants acted not merely with deliberate\nindifference to Norwood’s right to outdoor exercise, but with\nreckless disregard for it. The evidence viewed in light of that\nfinding does not support a defense of qualified immunity,\nwhich requires that defendants reasonably believed their con-\nduct to be lawful.\n\n   The government relies on a number of factual claims that\nwere disputed at trial, and which the verdict indicates the jury\nrejected. For example, the government asserts that after the\nlockdowns, the officials gradually eased restrictions “based on\nwhat they learned.” In fact, the jury heard testimony from\nprison officials that they “never even received anonymous\ninformation that a group, or any specific . . . inmate was\ninvolved in these plots to assault staff other than the perpetra-\ntors” who were identified on the day of the first two attacks.\nThe jury also heard evidence that contradicted prison offi-\ncials’ statements that they did not know if other inmates,\nincluding inmates of other races, were responsible for the first\nattack.7 Finally, with regard to the attack precipitating the\n   7\n     With regard to the first attack on staff by Hispanic inmates, Norwood\ntendered evidence that staff “believed it was likely that the Southern His-\npanics had put a hit out on staff” and that, generally speaking, Southern\nHispanic and black inmates were unlikely to form alliances.\n\f8524                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\nfourth lockdown, Norwood tendered evidence that prison offi-\ncials knew shortly after—and perhaps before—the attack that\nthe lone perpetrator, a Crip gang member, had specifically tar-\ngeted the staff member who was attacked and was already on\nlockdown status at the time of the attack because prison staff\nhad information that Crip inmates were going to assault some-\none in the facility.\n\n   Similarly, the government notes that Norwood, who was\nnot affiliated with any prison gangs, was locked down after\nthe attacks instigated by known gang members because “gang\nmembers often pressured unaffiliated inmates of the same eth-\nnicity to assist them.” However, Norwood tendered evidence\n—in the form of numerous memoranda from prison officials\nto staff and inmates—that the usual course of action after a\nviolent incident was to lock down those inmates closely iden-\ntified with the group to which the attacker belonged, for\nexample, Crip inmates in the case of an incident involving\nCrips. Furthermore, Defendant Pliler conceded that pressuring\nand violence among races and gangs occur during normal pro-\ngramming and that “[t]hat’s the nature of the prisoner at the\nprison.”\n\n   The majority claims that the fact that defendants imposed\ngeneral lockdowns after attacks on staff but only group-\nspecific restrictions after attacks on inmates “does not show\nmalicious intent or deliberate indifference.” The majority also\nstates that “plaintiff offered no evidence that the lockdowns\nwere meant to be punitive or were otherwise implemented in\nbad faith.” However, the jury thought otherwise, rejecting the\ndefendants’ testimony that the exercise deprivations were\nmotivated primarily by the officials’ concerns for safety and\nsecurity.\n\n  Finally, the majority suggests that defendants reasonably\ndecided to continue the lockdowns given the occurrence of\nviolent incidents during and after lockdown periods. How-\never, defendants conceded on cross-examination that “those\n\f                      NORWOOD v. VANCE                      8525\ntypes of incidents occur even when there is no lockdown”\nwith the same frequency, and that “the violence is pretty\nsteady.” Thus, the jury reasonably rejected defendants’ argu-\nment that they believed the unusual levels of violence justi-\nfied the long-term deprivations in this case. Indeed,\ndefendants’ argument that the circumstances here were “un-\nusual” and excused the exercise deprivation is belied by the\nlength of the lockdowns, which persisted for periods totaling\nover one year out of a twenty-two month period.\n\n   In sum, the evidence as to the necessity of the long-term\nexercise deprivations at issue in this case, viewed in light of\nthe jury verdict for Norwood, does not provide a sufficient\nbasis for determining, as a matter of law, that defendants were\nentitled to qualified immunity. The alleged error of the trial\njudge in failing sua sponte to grant qualified immunity cer-\ntainly does not rise to the level of plain error. The district\ncourt did not commit error—much less a plain error—and it\nwould be hard to imagine a trial court decision less likely to\n“seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\njudicial proceedings” than a decision not to give a jury\ninstruction that the trial judge determined would be confusing\nto the jury. Thus, if I were to reach the merits of the qualified\nimmunity defense, I would affirm the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n\n                               IV\n\n   The district court correctly applied the law and instructed\nthe jury according to controlling precedent. The jury, after\nhearing a full evidentiary presentation, rejected the defen-\ndants’ justification. The government failed to preserve the\ndefense of qualified immunity for appeal. Indeed, the govern-\nment did not even mention the affirmative defense after the\njury was seated, much less make the appropriate motion to\npresent the question to the district court for its consideration.\nThe district court did not commit error, much less plain error,\nin not sua sponte granting judgment as a matter of law after\n\f8526                  NORWOOD v. VANCE\ntrial based on an abandoned affirmative defense. There is no\njustification for overturning the jury’s verdict.\n\n  I respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
