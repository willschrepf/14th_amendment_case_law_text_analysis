On\n\nFebruary 26, 1992, Joseph W. Hullett filed suit against his ex-\n\nwife, Leslie B. Talcott, in the United States District Court for\n\nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking, inter alia, a\n\ndeclaration that the settlement agreement did not constitute a\n\nqualified domestic relations order (QDRO) within the meaning of\n\nERISA, and an injunction prohibiting payment of any of Hullett's\n\npension benefits to Talcott.1\n\n          Each of the parties subsequently filed cross-motions\n\nfor partial summary judgment.   The district court granted in part\n\nHullett's motion for partial summary judgment and denied\n\nTalcott's motion.   The court held that the settlement agreement\n\nconstitutes a QDRO, and that Talcott is entitled to receive one-\n\nhalf of the pension benefits which Hullett has accrued as of\n\nDecember 31, 1983, the date of the settlement agreement, if she\n\nremains unmarried at the time Hullett actually retires or is\n\nrequired to begin receiving pension benefits.   Talcott timely\n\nappealed to this court.   We reverse.\n\n\n1\n . The district court exercised jurisdiction over this case\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 and 29 U.S.C. ยง 1132(e)(1). This\ncourt has jurisdiction over this appeal from a final judgment\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291.\n\f                                  I.\n\n             Hullett and Talcott were married on August 19, 1961.\n\nIn 1965, Hullett commenced employment with Towers, Perrin,\n\nForster & Crosby, Inc. (Towers, Perrin) in its reinsurance\n\ndivision.    He thereafter became a manager, stockholder, vice-\n\npresident, senior vice-president, a member of the board of\n\ndirectors, and a member of the Towers, Perrin executive\n\ncommittee.\n\n             In 1982 or 1983, Hullett and Talcott separated.   On\n\nDecember 31, 1983, they entered into a property settlement\n\nagreement (the Agreement), which William H. Lamb, Esq., drafted.\n\nThe parties' subsequent divorce decree incorporated by reference\n\nthe Agreement as part of the decree.     At the time of the\n\nseparation, Hullett was a fully vested member of Towers, Perrin\n\npension plans which consisted of a Retirement Income Plan\n\nqualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (Plan\n\nor Pension Plan) and a non-qualified Retirement Income\n\nRestoration Plan which had become effective as of January 1,\n\n1976.   The Agreement provided that in the event that Talcott\n\nremained unmarried at the time of Hullett's retirement, Hullett\n\nwould pay to her, in the year of his retirement, fifty percent of\n\nall income received pursuant to his fully vested, accrued pension\n\ncredit under the Plan.\n\n             By letter dated January 22, 1986, Hullett wrote\n\nTalcott, contending that the Agreement contained an error in that\n\nthe pension was suppose to be valued as of December 31, 1983, of\n\nwhich value Talcott was suppose to receive fifty percent.\n\fTalcott responded that the Agreement was correct as written.\n\nHullett's attorney then wrote Lamb seeking to confirm Hullett's\n\nposition and to do the necessary to clarify the Agreement.    In\n\nresponse, Lamb's office disputed Hullett's claim.   It emphasized\n\nthat on the original drafts, 100% of all income received from the\n\npension plan was to be payable to Talcott upon Hullett's\n\nretirement and receipt of benefits, but that the valuation date\n\nwas deleted in return for Talcott receiving a full 50% of\n\nwhatever pension was ultimately payable to Hullett.   In December\n\nof 1986, Hullett informed Larry Margel, Chief Actuary at Towers,\n\nPerrin, that he had signed an agreement which dealt with his\n\nwhole pension instead of with the pension as valued at December\n\n31, 1983, and Margel provided Hullett with some arguments\n\nregarding the situation.\n\n          On February 5, 1990, Towers, Perrin unilaterally\n\nterminated Hullett's employment.   As defined in Hullett's Pension\n\nPlan, he had an early retirement date of January 1, 1991, and a\n\nnormal retirement date of January 1, 2001.   Hullett could receive\n\npension benefits as of his early retirement date based upon a\n\nreduction of benefits of 5% for each year below the normal\n\nretirement date.   Towers, Perrin and Hullett subsequently entered\n\ninto a Release and Agreement, whereby the parties agreed that\n\nHullett would receive a pension equal to the one he would have\n\nearned under the Plan had he remained employed with Towers,\n\nPerrin on his early retirement date.2\n\n2\n . This amounted to a pension under the Pension Plan of\n$7,258.37 per month commencing January 1, 2001, plus a social\n\f           By letter dated August 20, 1991, the administrator for\n\nthe plans, Karl W. Lohwater, determined that the Agreement was a\n\nQDRO3 within the meaning of ERISA, and that under the terms of\n\nthe Agreement, Talcott was entitled to 50% of all of Hullett's\n\npension benefits from both plans, with payment to commence when\n\nTalcott elected to receive the pension benefits.   Hullett\n\nappealed this initial determination.   By letter dated January 15,\n\n1992, the plan administrator made a final determination to\n\nrecognize the Agreement as a QDRO and to pay Talcott 50% of\n\nHullett's pension, without regard to any December 31, 1983\n\nvaluation date and without regard to when Hullett decided to\n\ncommence receipt of his share of the pension monies.\n\n           On February 26, 1992, Hullett filed a complaint against\n\nTalcott in federal court seeking, inter alia, a declaration that\n\nthe Agreement did not constitute a QDRO, and an injunction\n\nprohibiting payment of any of Hullett's pension benefits to\n\nTalcott.   Talcott filed a motion to dismiss Hullett's complaint,\n\ncontending that Hullett had improperly sought de novo review of\n\n(..continued)\nsecurity supplement under the Plan of $554.14 per month from\nJanuary 1, 2001 through May 31, 2003, plus a supplemental pension\nof $3,220.30 per month commencing January 1, 2001.\n3\n . A QDRO is defined in 29 U.S.C. ยง 1056(d)(3)(B)(i). Prior to\n1984, ERISA's provisions failed to clearly delineate the interest\nof a non-employee spouse in pension benefits of the employee\nspouse. Under the 1984 amendments to ERISA, if a domestic\nrelations order provides for distribution of part or all of a\nparticipant's benefits under a qualified pension plan to an\nalternate payee and meets the requirements set forth in the\nstatute, then the creation, recognition, or assignment of these\nbenefits to the alternate payee is not considered an assignment\nor alienation prohibited by ERISA's spendthrift provisions.\n\fthe plan administrator's determination, which the district court\n\ndenied.   Talcott subsequently filed a counterclaim against\n\nHullett and a crossclaim against Towers, Perrin, Towers Perrin\n\nRetirement Plan, and Towers Perrin Pension Restoration Plan\n\n(collectively, the \"Towers, Perrin Defendants\"), seeking a\n\ndeclaration of the rights of the parties.    The Towers, Perrin\n\ndefendants crossclaimed seeking similar relief.    Talcott also\n\nfiled a motion in limine seeking the introduction of parol\n\nevidence, which the district court denied.\n\n          The parties then filed cross-motions for partial\n\nsummary judgment.   The district court granted in part Hullett's\n\nmotion, and denied Talcott's motion regarding the QDRO\n\ndetermination but granted relief on other grounds.    The court\n\nheld that the Agreement constituted a QDRO, and that Talcott was\n\nentitled to receive one-half of the pension benefits which\n\nHullett had accrued as of December 31, 1983 if she remains\n\nunmarried at the time Hullett actually retires or is required to\n\nbegin receiving pension benefits from Towers, Perrin.    Talcott\n\nfiled a motion to alter or amend the judgment and for\n\nreconsideration, which the district court denied.\n\n                               II.\n\n          This court exercises plenary review over a grant of\n\nsummary judgment, and we apply the same test the district court\n\nshould have utilized initially.   Oritani Sav. and Loan Ass'n v.\n\nFidelity and Deposit Co., 989 F.2d 635, 637 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate only when it is demonstrated that\n\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\n\fparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.    Celotex Corp.\n\nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-32 (1986); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).         An\n\nissue of material fact is genuine \"if the evidence is such that a\n\nreasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).      In\n\ndeciding a motion for summary judgment, all reasonable inferences\n\nmust be drawn in favor of the non-movant.     Oritani, 989 F.2d at\n\n638.\n\n            For purposes of interpretation, a property settlement\n\nagreement is treated the same as any other contract under\n\nPennsylvania law.    See e.g., Lower v. Lower, 584 A.2d 1028, 1030\n\n(Pa.Super. 1991).    A court's purpose in examining a contract is\n\nto interpret the intent of the contracting parties, as\n\nobjectively manifested by them.    Mellon Bank, N.A. v. Aetna\n\nBusiness Credit, Inc., 619 F.2d 1001, 1009 (3d Cir. 1980).      The\n\nprocess of interpreting a contract requires the court to make a\n\npreliminary inquiry as to whether the contract before it is\n\nambiguous.   Stendardo v. Federal Nat'l Mortgage Ass'n, 991 F.2d\n\n1089, 1094 (3d Cir. 1993).    A contract provision is ambiguous if\n\nit is susceptible of two reasonable alternative interpretations.\n\nMellon, 619 F.2d at 1011.    Where the written terms of the\n\ncontract are not ambiguous and can only be read one way, the\n\ncourt will interpret the contract as a matter of law.    Stendardo,\n\n991 F.2d at 1094.    If the contract is determined to be ambiguous,\n\nthen the interpretation of the contract is left to the\n\nfactfinder, to resolve the ambiguity in light of extrinsic\n\nevidence.    Id.; Mellon, 619 F.2d at 1011.\n\f            Pennsylvania courts apply the \"plain meaning rule\" of\n\ninterpretation of contracts which assumes that the intent of the\n\nparties to an instrument is \"embodied in the writing itself, and\n\nwhen the words are clear and unambiguous the intent is to be\n\ndiscovered only from the express language of the agreement.\"\n\nCounty of Dauphin v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., 770 F. Supp. 248,\n\n251 (M.D.Pa.) (quotation omitted), aff'd, 937 F.2d 596 (3d Cir.\n\n1991).    Nevertheless, a determination whether the language of an\n\nagreement is unambiguous may not be apparent without examining\n\nthe context in which the agreement arose.    Steuart v. McChesney,\n\n444 A.2d 659, 662 (Pa. 1982).    Thus, a court is not always\n\nconfined to the four corners of the written document in\n\ndetermining whether an ambiguity exists.    Mellon, 619 F.2d at\n\n1011.    Rather, the judge must \"consider the words of the\n\ncontract, the alternative meaning suggested by counsel, and the\n\nnature of the objective evidence to be offered in support of that\n\nmeaning.\"   Id.\n\n                                III.\n\n            We begin our analysis by examining the language of the\n\nAgreement, which states in relevant part:\n          The retirement income plan listed in Schedule\n          \"A\" is payable to Husband upon his\n          retirement. The parties agree that in the\n          event Wife remains unmarried at the time of\n          Husband's retirement that fifty percent (50%)\n          of all income received pursuant to said\n          pension plan shall be paid by Husband to Wife\n          in the year of his retirement. It is\n          understood by both parties, that this pension\n          benefit is payable to Husband only if he\n          survives to his early retirement date of\n          January 1, 1991, and Husband, or Husband's\n\f          estate, are only bound hereby if Husband does\n          so survive.\n\n                               * * *\n\n          Schedule \"A\"\n\n          (1) Seventy (70) shares of Towers, Perrin\n          Common Stock with a total current value of\n          $63,700.00 on the date of valuation, December\n          31, 1983.\n\n          (2) Two thousand three hundred and ten\n          (2,310) shares of Towers, Perrin Preferred\n          Stock with a total current value of\n          $231,000.00 on the date of valuation,\n          December 31, 1983.\n\n          (3) Fully vested, accrued pension credit\n          under the Towers, Perrin Retirement Income\n          Plan (hereinafter referred to as Towers,\n          Perrin RIP).\n\n\n          The district court found that the above contractual\n\nlanguage was susceptible to only one interpretation.   The court\n\nheld that Talcott was entitled to 50% of the pension credit\n\nvested and accrued as of December 31, 1983, the date of the\n\nAgreement.   In so holding, the court relied on the past tense\n\nform of the words \"vested\" and \"accrued\".   However, this language\n\nalso can be interpreted to refer to the pension credit \"vested\n\nand accrued\" at the time of Hullett's retirement.\n\n          The record in this case shows that the district court\n\nerred in holding that the language of the Agreement was not\n\nambiguous.   The evidence supports as reasonable Talcott's\n\nalternative interpretation that she was to receive 50% of \"all\"\n\nof Hullett's pension, without being limited to only 50% of the\n\npension credit vested and accrued at the time of the Agreement.\n\fSchedule A was specific in providing valuation dates for the\n\nother two assets identified on it, Talcott's share of the common\n\nand preferred stock, and the body of the Agreement specifically\n\nstates that these assets are valued as of December 31, 1983.      In\n\ncontrast, the parties did not provide a valuation date for the\n\nPension Plan.   Lamb, the scrivener of the Agreement, testified\n\nthat the draft version of the Agreement provided that Talcott was\n\nto receive 100% of the pension valued as of December 31, 1983,\n\nbut that the valuation date was deleted in subsequent drafts and\n\nthe final Agreement in return for Talcott receiving a full 50% of\n\nwhatever pension was ultimately payable to Hullett.\n\n          Moreover, unlike the pension language, Talcott's\n\nentitlement to the other assets on Schedule A is in no way\n\ncontingent upon her remaining unmarried.    Talcott argues that\n\nthis is because she was only getting the shares of stock that\n\nwere rightfully hers as of the time of the divorce, but that\n\nHullett did not want to continue increasing her share of his\n\npension if she then chose to remarry.   This interpretation of the\n\ncontractual language is a reasonable one.\n\n          The district court observed that its interpretation was\n\nfurther supported by Paragraph 12 of the Agreement, which states\n\nthat neither party has any claim to any personal property,\n\ntangible or intangible, thereafter acquired by the other.    The\n\ninclusion of Paragraph 12, a standard contractual provision, does\n\nnot preclude Talcott's interpretation of the Agreement as a\n\nreasonable one.   As testified by the scrivener, Lamb:\n\f            [Paragraph 12 is] a standard clause which is\n            intended to cover the situation where after\n            this agreement is signed husband goes out and\n            buys a car or wife goes out and buys an\n            airplane or a townhouse or whatever, neither\n            party has any claim on any of those assets\n            after this agreement is signed.\n\n\nSimilarly, the two contractual provisions cited by Hullett,\n\nconcerning the freedom to live apart and engage in any employment\n\nand the release of claims against each other, are standard\n\ncontractual provisions which serve separate and distinct\n\npurposes.   These provisions are not inherently inconsistent with\n\nTalcott's suggested interpretation of the Agreement.\n\n            The extrinsic evidence presented by Talcott shows that\n\nher interpretation is a reasonable alternative one, and thus the\n\nlanguage regarding the amount of pension benefits to which\n\nTalcott is entitled is ambiguous.     See e.g., Lower, 584 A.2d at\n\n1032 (holding that failure to define \"alimony\" and \"support\"\n\ncreated ambiguity to be resolved by factfinder); Lohmann v.\n\nPiczon, 487 A.2d 1386, 1389 (Pa.Super. 1985) (finding \"net income\n\nafter taxes,\" 25% of which husband was to pay wife, was ambiguous\n\nas to whether it included any of husband's tax deductions); De\n\nWitt v. Kaiser, 484 A.2d 121, 126 (Pa.Super. 1984) (finding term\n\n\"income\" in context of husband's support obligations to be\n\nambiguous, thus requiring extrinsic evidence to define term).\n\nTherefore, we must remand this case to allow a factfinder to\n\nresolve the ambiguity in light of the extrinsic evidence.\n\n                                IV.\n\f            The second dispute focuses on the following contractual\n\nlanguage:\n            The retirement income plan listed in Schedule\n            \"A\" is payable to Husband upon his\n            retirement. The parties agree that in the\n            event Wife remains unmarried at the time of\n            Husband's retirement that fifty percent (50%)\n            of all income received pursuant to said\n            pension plan shall be paid by Husband to Wife\n            in the year of his retirement. It is\n            understood by both parties, that this pension\n            benefit is payable to Husband only if he\n            survives to his early retirement date of\n            January 1, 1991, and Husband, or Husband's\n            estate, are only bound hereby if Husband does\n            so survive.\n\n\n            The district court attempted to examine the use of the\n\nword \"retirement\" as used in the Plan to determine what the\n\nparties meant, but found that the Plan does not provide a single\n\ndefinition of the word.    Rather, the Plan describes three\n\nseparate retirement dates, early, normal, and postponed.      The\n\ncourt thus turned back to the Agreement to determine which\n\ndefinition the parties intended to control.    The court concluded\n\nthat the parties intended that Talcott be entitled to her\n\nbenefits when Hullett elects to and does receive his pension\n\nbenefits, or when he is required to commence receipt of his\n\npension benefits under the terms of the Plan, in the event that\n\nTalcott remains unmarried at that time.\n\n            Before the district court, Hullett argued that Talcott\n\nis entitled to 50% of the pension benefits which he accrued prior\n\nto December 31, 1983, only if she remains unmarried at the time\n\nhe actually retires from the workplace in general.    On appeal,\n\fHullett now adopts the district court's interpretation of the\n\nAgreement.\n\n          Talcott argues that the district court misconstrued the\n\nAgreement, and notes that the use of the term \"retirement\" in the\n\nAgreement directly follows a sentence in which the parties\n\ndefined retirement as that point at which the retirement income\n\nplan was \"payable\" to Hullett.   She contends that \"payable\" means\n\nthe point at which the money may be paid on demand, not the point\n\nat which payment actually commences.   See Black's Law Dictionary\n\n(5th ed. 1979) at 1016 (defining payable as \"[c]apable of being\n\npaid; suitable to be paid; admitting or demanding payment; justly\n\ndue; legally enforceable\").   Talcott asserts that this date would\n\nbe January 1, 1991, when Hullett reached his early retirement\n\ndate under the Plan, and that the court erred in construing the\n\nAgreement to empower Hullett to hold her pension money hostage to\n\nher remaining unmarried until he turns 60, in the year 2001.\n\nTalcott describes various scenarios where the district court's\n\ninterpretation of the Agreement could cause her to lose all or\n\npart of her share in the pension benefits.   Thus, Talcott argues,\n\nbecause she remained unmarried at the time of Hullett's\n\nretirement from Towers, Perrin, she is presently entitled to her\n\n50% share of pension benefits, whatever they might be, and she is\n\nfree to remarry.\n\n          Again, Talcott's interpretation of the contractual\n\nlanguage is a reasonable alternative one.    It is clear that the\n\nparties did not foresee or provide for Hullett terminating his\n\nemployment with Towers, Perrin prior to when he was entitled to\n\fhis pension benefits.    Thus, the contractual language is\n\nambiguous, and its interpretation should be left to the\n\nfactfinder to resolve in light of any extrinsic evidence the\n\nparties may present on remand.\n\n                                  V.\n\n            The parties' final dispute concerns the district\n\ncourt's appropriate standard of review of the plan\n\nadministrator's determinations.     In Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.\n\nv. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101 (1989), the United States Supreme Court\n\nheld that challenges under section 1132(a)(1)(B) of ERISA are to\n\nbe reviewed under a de novo standard unless the plan gives the\n\nadministrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility\n\nfor benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.    Id. at 115.\n\nWhere a plan administrator is given discretionary authority to\n\ndetermine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of\n\nthe plan, the appropriate standard of review of the\n\nadministrator's determinations is an arbitrary and capricious\n\nstandard.   Id. at 114-15.   Discretionary powers need not be\n\nexpressly granted; they may be implied by the plan's terms.      Luby\nv. Teamsters Health Welfare & Pension Trust Funds, 944 F.2d 1176,\n\n1181 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\n            Neither party has appealed the district court's ruling\n\nthat the Agreement constitutes a QDRO, and therefore it is not\n\nnecessary for this court to determine whether the district court\n\nerred in reviewing de novo the plan administrator's finding that\n\nthe Agreement is a QDRO.     The district court did not err in\n\nholding that it should review de novo the plan administrator's\n\fconstruction of the Agreement, which involved issues of contract\n\ninterpretation under the Agreement and not the Plan.   However, as\n\ndiscussed above, the Agreement is ambiguous and thus the issues\n\nof the amount of Talcott's share of pension benefits, the time of\n\nHullett's retirement, and the effect of Talcott's marital status\n\nare for the factfinder to resolve on remand in light of the\n\nextrinsic evidence.\n\n          Additionally, the district court erred in refusing to\n\ngive   deference to the plan administrator's determination that he\n\nwould segregate Talcott's QDRO monies and commence payment at the\n\ntime she elects to receive her share.   That is, when Talcott\n\nelects to begin her benefit payments, the administrator will\n\ncalculate the amount she is entitled to receive by making an\n\nactuarial calculation converting the present value of one half of\n\nHullett's pension, valued as of the date determined by the\n\nfactfinder, to a pension payable over Talcott's lifetime.    In\n\ncontrast, the court held that Talcott may continue receiving\n\nmonthly benefits only as long as Hullett receives them pursuant\n\nto the Plan.\n\n          In making his determination regarding the distribution\n\nof payments, the plan administrator exercised his discretionary\n\nauthority to construe the terms of the Plan.   Section 8.1(h) of\n\nthe Plan provides, \"If the [plan administer] receives a QDRO with\n\nrespect to a Member's divorce from his Spouse, it will comply\n\nwith such Order and reduce the benefits otherwise payable to or\n\non behalf of such Member under this Plan or the Actuarial\n\nEquivalent of any benefits payable to his Spouse under this Plan\n\fpursuant to such QDRO.\"   Additionally, the Plan Procedures for\n\nDomestic Relations Orders provides that any amount that would be\n\npayable to an alternate payee under a QDRO will be separately\n\naccounted for under the Plan and will remain segregated while the\n\nplan participant or alternate payee appeals the administrator's\n\nQDRO determination.   At the end of this appeal period, \"the\n\nsegregated amounts, adjusted for investment results, will be paid\n\nto the plan participant or the alternate payee (or credited to\n\nthe account of the plan participant or alternate payee) in\n\naccordance with the determination of the [plan administrator].\"\n\nThus, the district court erred in refusing to give deference to\n\nthe administrator's holding that Talcott's pension is payable\n\nover her lifetime, and instead holding that payments to Talcott\n\nwill terminate when Hullett's pension payments terminate.      The\n\ncourt was required to uphold the administrator's determination as\n\nto QDRO payments unless it was arbitrary and capricious.     It was\n\nnot.\n\n          In summary, the district court erred by granting in\n\npart Hullett's motion for partial summary judgment.   Talcott has\n\npresented reasonable alternative interpretations of the\n\ncontractual language regarding the distribution of Hullett's\n\npension and the provision requiring payment upon Hullett's\n\nretirement if Talcott remains unmarried.   Thus, these provisions\n\nare ambiguous and are appropriate for a factfinder's resolution\n\nupon remand.   Finally, although the district court properly\n\nreviewed the plan administrator's interpretation of the Agreement\n\non a de novo basis, it erred in refusing to give deference to the\n\fplan administrator's determination regarding the payment of\n\nbenefits under the QDRO.\n\n                              VI.\n\n          Accordingly, the district court's grant of partial\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Hullett will be reversed and the\n\ncase remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f",

On\n\nFebruary 26, 1992, Joseph W. Hullett filed suit against his ex-\n\nwife, Leslie B. Talcott, in the United States District Court for\n\nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking, inter alia, a\n\ndeclaration that the settlement agreement did not constitute a\n\nqualified domestic relations order (QDRO) within the meaning of\n\nERISA, and an injunction prohibiting payment of any of Hullett's\n\npension benefits to Talcott.1\n\n          Each of the parties subsequently filed cross-motions\n\nfor partial summary judgment.   The district court granted in part\n\nHullett's motion for partial summary judgment and denied\n\nTalcott's motion.   The court held that the settlement agreement\n\nconstitutes a QDRO, and that Talcott is entitled to receive one-\n\nhalf of the pension benefits which Hullett has accrued as of\n\nDecember 31, 1983, the date of the settlement agreement, if she\n\nremains unmarried at the time Hullett actually retires or is\n\nrequired to begin receiving pension benefits.   Talcott timely\n\nappealed to this court.   We reverse.\n\n\n1\n . The district court exercised jurisdiction over this case\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 and 29 U.S.C. ยง 1132(e)(1). This\ncourt has jurisdiction over this appeal from a final judgment\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291.\n\f                                  I.\n\n             Hullett and Talcott were married on August 19, 1961.\n\nIn 1965, Hullett commenced employment with Towers, Perrin,\n\nForster & Crosby, Inc. (Towers, Perrin) in its reinsurance\n\ndivision.    He thereafter became a manager, stockholder, vice-\n\npresident, senior vice-president, a member of the board of\n\ndirectors, and a member of the Towers, Perrin executive\n\ncommittee.\n\n             In 1982 or 1983, Hullett and Talcott separated.   On\n\nDecember 31, 1983, they entered into a property settlement\n\nagreement (the Agreement), which William H. Lamb, Esq., drafted.\n\nThe parties' subsequent divorce decree incorporated by reference\n\nthe Agreement as part of the decree.     At the time of the\n\nseparation, Hullett was a fully vested member of Towers, Perrin\n\npension plans which consisted of a Retirement Income Plan\n\nqualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (Plan\n\nor Pension Plan) and a non-qualified Retirement Income\n\nRestoration Plan which had become effective as of January 1,\n\n1976.   The Agreement provided that in the event that Talcott\n\nremained unmarried at the time of Hullett's retirement, Hullett\n\nwould pay to her, in the year of his retirement, fifty percent of\n\nall income received pursuant to his fully vested, accrued pension\n\ncredit under the Plan.\n\n             By letter dated January 22, 1986, Hullett wrote\n\nTalcott, contending that the Agreement contained an error in that\n\nthe pension was suppose to be valued as of December 31, 1983, of\n\nwhich value Talcott was suppose to receive fifty percent.\n\fTalcott responded that the Agreement was correct as written.\n\nHullett's attorney then wrote Lamb seeking to confirm Hullett's\n\nposition and to do the necessary to clarify the Agreement.    In\n\nresponse, Lamb's office disputed Hullett's claim.   It emphasized\n\nthat on the original drafts, 100% of all income received from the\n\npension plan was to be payable to Talcott upon Hullett's\n\nretirement and receipt of benefits, but that the valuation date\n\nwas deleted in return for Talcott receiving a full 50% of\n\nwhatever pension was ultimately payable to Hullett.   In December\n\nof 1986, Hullett informed Larry Margel, Chief Actuary at Towers,\n\nPerrin, that he had signed an agreement which dealt with his\n\nwhole pension instead of with the pension as valued at December\n\n31, 1983, and Margel provided Hullett with some arguments\n\nregarding the situation.\n\n          On February 5, 1990, Towers, Perrin unilaterally\n\nterminated Hullett's employment.   As defined in Hullett's Pension\n\nPlan, he had an early retirement date of January 1, 1991, and a\n\nnormal retirement date of January 1, 2001.   Hullett could receive\n\npension benefits as of his early retirement date based upon a\n\nreduction of benefits of 5% for each year below the normal\n\nretirement date.   Towers, Perrin and Hullett subsequently entered\n\ninto a Release and Agreement, whereby the parties agreed that\n\nHullett would receive a pension equal to the one he would have\n\nearned under the Plan had he remained employed with Towers,\n\nPerrin on his early retirement date.2\n\n2\n . This amounted to a pension under the Pension Plan of\n$7,258.37 per month commencing January 1, 2001, plus a social\n\f           By letter dated August 20, 1991, the administrator for\n\nthe plans, Karl W. Lohwater, determined that the Agreement was a\n\nQDRO3 within the meaning of ERISA, and that under the terms of\n\nthe Agreement, Talcott was entitled to 50% of all of Hullett's\n\npension benefits from both plans, with payment to commence when\n\nTalcott elected to receive the pension benefits.   Hullett\n\nappealed this initial determination.   By letter dated January 15,\n\n1992, the plan administrator made a final determination to\n\nrecognize the Agreement as a QDRO and to pay Talcott 50% of\n\nHullett's pension, without regard to any December 31, 1983\n\nvaluation date and without regard to when Hullett decided to\n\ncommence receipt of his share of the pension monies.\n\n           On February 26, 1992, Hullett filed a complaint against\n\nTalcott in federal court seeking, inter alia, a declaration that\n\nthe Agreement did not constitute a QDRO, and an injunction\n\nprohibiting payment of any of Hullett's pension benefits to\n\nTalcott.   Talcott filed a motion to dismiss Hullett's complaint,\n\ncontending that Hullett had improperly sought de novo review of\n\n(..continued)\nsecurity supplement under the Plan of $554.14 per month from\nJanuary 1, 2001 through May 31, 2003, plus a supplemental pension\nof $3,220.30 per month commencing January 1, 2001.\n3\n . A QDRO is defined in 29 U.S.C. ยง 1056(d)(3)(B)(i). Prior to\n1984, ERISA's provisions failed to clearly delineate the interest\nof a non-employee spouse in pension benefits of the employee\nspouse. Under the 1984 amendments to ERISA, if a domestic\nrelations order provides for distribution of part or all of a\nparticipant's benefits under a qualified pension plan to an\nalternate payee and meets the requirements set forth in the\nstatute, then the creation, recognition, or assignment of these\nbenefits to the alternate payee is not considered an assignment\nor alienation prohibited by ERISA's spendthrift provisions.\n\fthe plan administrator's determination, which the district court\n\ndenied.   Talcott subsequently filed a counterclaim against\n\nHullett and a crossclaim against Towers, Perrin, Towers Perrin\n\nRetirement Plan, and Towers Perrin Pension Restoration Plan\n\n(collectively, the \"Towers, Perrin Defendants\"), seeking a\n\ndeclaration of the rights of the parties.    The Towers, Perrin\n\ndefendants crossclaimed seeking similar relief.    Talcott also\n\nfiled a motion in limine seeking the introduction of parol\n\nevidence, which the district court denied.\n\n          The parties then filed cross-motions for partial\n\nsummary judgment.   The district court granted in part Hullett's\n\nmotion, and denied Talcott's motion regarding the QDRO\n\ndetermination but granted relief on other grounds.    The court\n\nheld that the Agreement constituted a QDRO, and that Talcott was\n\nentitled to receive one-half of the pension benefits which\n\nHullett had accrued as of December 31, 1983 if she remains\n\nunmarried at the time Hullett actually retires or is required to\n\nbegin receiving pension benefits from Towers, Perrin.    Talcott\n\nfiled a motion to alter or amend the judgment and for\n\nreconsideration, which the district court denied.\n\n                               II.\n\n          This court exercises plenary review over a grant of\n\nsummary judgment, and we apply the same test the district court\n\nshould have utilized initially.

Thus, a court is not always\n\nconfined to the four corners of the written document in\n\ndetermining whether an ambiguity exists.    Mellon, 619 F.2d at\n\n1011.    Rather, the judge must \"consider the words of the\n\ncontract, the alternative meaning suggested by counsel, and the\n\nnature of the objective evidence to be offered in support of that\n\nmeaning.\"   Id.\n\n                                III.\n\n            We begin our analysis by examining the language of the\n\nAgreement, which states in relevant part:\n          The retirement income plan listed in Schedule\n          \"A\" is payable to Husband upon his\n          retirement. The parties agree that in the\n          event Wife remains unmarried at the time of\n          Husband's retirement that fifty percent (50%)\n          of all income received pursuant to said\n          pension plan shall be paid by Husband to Wife\n          in the year of his retirement. It is\n          understood by both parties, that this pension\n          benefit is payable to Husband only if he\n          survives to his early retirement date of\n          January 1, 1991, and Husband, or Husband's\n\f          estate, are only bound hereby if Husband does\n          so survive.\n\n                               * * *\n\n          Schedule \"A\"\n\n          (1) Seventy (70) shares of Towers, Perrin\n          Common Stock with a total current value of\n          $63,700.00 on the date of valuation, December\n          31, 1983.\n\n          (2) Two thousand three hundred and ten\n          (2,310) shares of Towers, Perrin Preferred\n          Stock with a total current value of\n          $231,000.00 on the date of valuation,\n          December 31, 1983.\n\n          (3) Fully vested, accrued pension credit\n          under the Towers, Perrin Retirement Income\n          Plan (hereinafter referred to as Towers,\n          Perrin RIP).\n\n\n          The district court found that the above contractual\n\nlanguage was susceptible to only one interpretation.   The court\n\nheld that Talcott was entitled to 50% of the pension credit\n\nvested and accrued as of December 31, 1983, the date of the\n\nAgreement.   In so holding, the court relied on the past tense\n\nform of the words \"vested\" and \"accrued\".   However, this language\n\nalso can be interpreted to refer to the pension credit \"vested\n\nand accrued\" at the time of Hullett's retirement.\n\n          The record in this case shows that the district court\n\nerred in holding that the language of the Agreement was not\n\nambiguous.   The evidence supports as reasonable Talcott's\n\nalternative interpretation that she was to receive 50% of \"all\"\n\nof Hullett's pension, without being limited to only 50% of the\n\npension credit vested and accrued at the time of the Agreement.\n\fSchedule A was specific in providing valuation dates for the\n\nother two assets identified on it, Talcott's share of the common\n\nand preferred stock, and the body of the Agreement specifically\n\nstates that these assets are valued as of December 31, 1983.      In\n\ncontrast, the parties did not provide a valuation date for the\n\nPension Plan.   Lamb, the scrivener of the Agreement, testified\n\nthat the draft version of the Agreement provided that Talcott was\n\nto receive 100% of the pension valued as of December 31, 1983,\n\nbut that the valuation date was deleted in subsequent drafts and\n\nthe final Agreement in return for Talcott receiving a full 50% of\n\nwhatever pension was ultimately payable to Hullett.\n\n          Moreover, unlike the pension language, Talcott's\n\nentitlement to the other assets on Schedule A is in no way\n\ncontingent upon her remaining unmarried.    Talcott argues that\n\nthis is because she was only getting the shares of stock that\n\nwere rightfully hers as of the time of the divorce, but that\n\nHullett did not want to continue increasing her share of his\n\npension if she then chose to remarry.   This interpretation of the\n\ncontractual language is a reasonable one.\n\n          The district court observed that its interpretation was\n\nfurther supported by Paragraph 12 of the Agreement, which states\n\nthat neither party has any claim to any personal property,\n\ntangible or intangible, thereafter acquired by the other.    The\n\ninclusion of Paragraph 12, a standard contractual provision, does\n\nnot preclude Talcott's interpretation of the Agreement as a\n\nreasonable one.   As testified by the scrivener, Lamb:\n\f            [Paragraph 12 is] a standard clause which is\n            intended to cover the situation where after\n            this agreement is signed husband goes out and\n            buys a car or wife goes out and buys an\n            airplane or a townhouse or whatever, neither\n            party has any claim on any of those assets\n            after this agreement is signed.\n\n\nSimilarly, the two contractual provisions cited by Hullett,\n\nconcerning the freedom to live apart and engage in any employment\n\nand the release of claims against each other, are standard\n\ncontractual provisions which serve separate and distinct\n\npurposes.   These provisions are not inherently inconsistent with\n\nTalcott's suggested interpretation of the Agreement.\n\n            The extrinsic evidence presented by Talcott shows that\n\nher interpretation is a reasonable alternative one, and thus the\n\nlanguage regarding the amount of pension benefits to which\n\nTalcott is entitled is ambiguous.     See e.g., Lower, 584 A.2d at\n\n1032 (holding that failure to define \"alimony\" and \"support\"\n\ncreated ambiguity to be resolved by factfinder); Lohmann v.\n\nPiczon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2359408\"><a href=\"/opinion/2359408/lohmann-v-piczon/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1389 (Pa.Super. 1985) (finding \"net income\n\nafter taxes,\" 25% of which husband was to pay wife, was ambiguous\n\nas to whether it included any of husband's tax deductions); De\n\nWitt v.

The parties agree that in the\n            event Wife remains unmarried at the time of\n            Husband's retirement that fifty percent (50%)\n            of all income received pursuant to said\n            pension plan shall be paid by Husband to Wife\n            in the year of his retirement. It is\n            understood by both parties, that this pension\n            benefit is payable to Husband only if he\n            survives to his early retirement date of\n            January 1, 1991, and Husband, or Husband's\n            estate, are only bound hereby if Husband does\n            so survive.\n\n\n            The district court attempted to examine the use of the\n\nword \"retirement\" as used in the Plan to determine what the\n\nparties meant, but found that the Plan does not provide a single\n\ndefinition of the word.    Rather, the Plan describes three\n\nseparate retirement dates, early, normal, and postponed.      The\n\ncourt thus turned back to the Agreement to determine which\n\ndefinition the parties intended to control.    The court concluded\n\nthat the parties intended that Talcott be entitled to her\n\nbenefits when Hullett elects to and does receive his pension\n\nbenefits, or when he is required to commence receipt of his\n\npension benefits under the terms of the Plan, in the event that\n\nTalcott remains unmarried at that time.\n\n            Before the district court, Hullett argued that Talcott\n\nis entitled to 50% of the pension benefits which he accrued prior\n\nto December 31, 1983, only if she remains unmarried at the time\n\nhe actually retires from the workplace in general.    On appeal,\n\fHullett now adopts the district court's interpretation of the\n\nAgreement.\n\n          Talcott argues that the district court misconstrued the\n\nAgreement, and notes that the use of the term \"retirement\" in the\n\nAgreement directly follows a sentence in which the parties\n\ndefined retirement as that point at which the retirement income\n\nplan was \"payable\" to Hullett.   She contends that \"payable\" means\n\nthe point at which the money may be paid on demand, not the point\n\nat which payment actually commences.   See Black's Law Dictionary\n\n(5th ed. 1979) at 1016 (defining payable as \"[c]apable of being\n\npaid; suitable to be paid; admitting or demanding payment; justly\n\ndue; legally enforceable\").   Talcott asserts that this date would\n\nbe January 1, 1991, when Hullett reached his early retirement\n\ndate under the Plan, and that the court erred in construing the\n\nAgreement to empower Hullett to hold her pension money hostage to\n\nher remaining unmarried until he turns 60, in the year 2001.\n\nTalcott describes various scenarios where the district court's\n\ninterpretation of the Agreement could cause her to lose all or\n\npart of her share in the pension benefits.   Thus, Talcott argues,\n\nbecause she remained unmarried at the time of Hullett's\n\nretirement from Towers, Perrin, she is presently entitled to her\n\n50% share of pension benefits, whatever they might be, and she is\n\nfree to remarry.\n\n          Again, Talcott's interpretation of the contractual\n\nlanguage is a reasonable alternative one.    It is clear that the\n\nparties did not foresee or provide for Hullett terminating his\n\nemployment with Towers, Perrin prior to when he was entitled to\n\fhis pension benefits.    Thus, the contractual language is\n\nambiguous, and its interpretation should be left to the\n\nfactfinder to resolve in light of any extrinsic evidence the\n\nparties may present on remand.\n\n                                  V.\n\n            The parties' final dispute concerns the district\n\ncourt's appropriate standard of review of the plan\n\nadministrator's determinations.

Bruch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989), the United States Supreme Court\n\nheld that challenges under section 1132(a)(1)(B) of ERISA are to\n\nbe reviewed under a de novo standard unless the plan gives the\n\nadministrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility\n\nfor benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.    Id. at 115.\n\nWhere a plan administrator is given discretionary authority to\n\ndetermine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of\n\nthe plan, the appropriate standard of review of the\n\nadministrator's determinations is an arbitrary and capricious\n\nstandard.   Id. at 114-15.   Discretionary powers need not be\n\nexpressly granted; they may be implied by the plan's terms.      Luby\nv. Teamsters Health Welfare & Pension Trust Funds, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568509\"><a href=\"/opinion/568509/diane-c-luby-v-teamsters-health-welfare-and-pension-trust-funds/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1181 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\n            Neither party has appealed the district court's ruling\n\nthat the Agreement constitutes a QDRO, and therefore it is not\n\nnecessary for this court to determine whether the district court\n\nerred in reviewing de novo the plan administrator's finding that\n\nthe Agreement is a QDRO.     The district court did not err in\n\nholding that it should review de novo the plan administrator's\n\fconstruction of the Agreement, which involved issues of contract\n\ninterpretation under the Agreement and not the Plan.   However, as\n\ndiscussed above, the Agreement is ambiguous and thus the issues\n\nof the amount of Talcott's share of pension benefits, the time of\n\nHullett's retirement, and the effect of Talcott's marital status\n\nare for the factfinder to resolve on remand in light of the\n\nextrinsic evidence.\n\n          Additionally, the district court erred in refusing to\n\ngive   deference to the plan administrator's determination that he\n\nwould segregate Talcott's QDRO monies and commence payment at the\n\ntime she elects to receive her share.   That is, when Talcott\n\nelects to begin her benefit payments, the administrator will\n\ncalculate the amount she is entitled to receive by making an\n\nactuarial calculation converting the present value of one half of\n\nHullett's pension, valued as of the date determined by the\n\nfactfinder, to a pension payable over Talcott's lifetime.    In\n\ncontrast, the court held that Talcott may continue receiving\n\nmonthly benefits only as long as Hullett receives them pursuant\n\nto the Plan.\n\n          In making his determination regarding the distribution\n\nof payments, the plan administrator exercised his discretionary\n\nauthority to construe the terms of the Plan.   Section 8.1(h) of\n\nthe Plan provides, \"If the [plan administer] receives a QDRO with\n\nrespect to a Member's divorce from his Spouse, it will comply\n\nwith such Order and reduce the benefits otherwise payable to or\n\non behalf of such Member under this Plan or the Actuarial\n\nEquivalent of any benefits payable to his Spouse under this Plan\n\fpursuant to such QDRO.\"   Additionally, the Plan Procedures for\n\nDomestic Relations Orders provides that any amount that would be\n\npayable to an alternate payee under a QDRO will be separately\n\naccounted for under the Plan and will remain segregated while the\n\nplan participant or alternate payee appeals the administrator's\n\nQDRO determination.   At the end of this appeal period, \"the\n\nsegregated amounts, adjusted for investment results, will be paid\n\nto the plan participant or the alternate payee (or credited to\n\nthe account of the plan participant or alternate payee) in\n\naccordance with the determination of the [plan administrator].\"\n\nThus, the district court erred in refusing to give deference to\n\nthe administrator's holding that Talcott's pension is payable\n\nover her lifetime, and instead holding that payments to Talcott\n\nwill terminate when Hullett's pension payments terminate.      The\n\ncourt was required to uphold the administrator's determination as\n\nto QDRO payments unless it was arbitrary and capricious.     It was\n\nnot.\n\n          In summary, the district court erred by granting in\n\npart Hullett's motion for partial summary judgment.   Talcott has\n\npresented reasonable alternative interpretations of the\n\ncontractual language regarding the distribution of Hullett's\n\npension and the provision requiring payment upon Hullett's\n\nretirement if Talcott remains unmarried.   Thus, these provisions\n\nare ambiguous and are appropriate for a factfinder's resolution\n\nupon remand.   Finally, although the district court properly\n\nreviewed the plan administrator's interpretation of the Agreement\n\non a de novo basis, it erred in refusing to give deference to the\n\fplan administrator's determination regarding the payment of\n\nbenefits under the QDRO.\n\n                              VI.\n\n          Accordingly, the district court's grant of partial\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Hullett will be reversed and the\n\ncase remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f</pre>",
