They\n\nare:\n\n              1. Do Iowa Code section 216.6A, Iowa’s equal pay law,\n       and the accompanying remedial language in section\n       216.15(9)(a)(9), apply to permit a plaintiff to pursue wage\n       discrimination claims under section 216.6A that accrued\n       before April 28, 2009, the date Iowa’s General Assembly\n       made these statutes effective, in the absence of express\n       legislative language making these laws retroactive?\n\n            2. If a prevailing plaintiff may only recover damages\n       under Iowa Code section 216.6A and the accompanying\n       remedial language in section 216.15(9)(a)(9) prospectively,\n       may the same plaintiff also recover damages for prevailing on\n       a wage discrimination claim under section 216.6, and if so,\n       what types of damages may that plaintiff recover and for\n       what period of time?\n\n       For the reasons discussed herein, we answer the questions as\n\nfollows:\n\n             1. No.\n\n             2. Yes. Recoverable damages for loss of income are\n       based on discriminatory wage payments that occurred within\n       300 days before the plaintiff filed a complaint with the civil\n       rights commission.\n\n       I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n       Plaintiff Erin Dindinger worked for the defendant company,\n\nAllsteel, Inc., from December 1999 through May 20, 2011. Plaintiff Lisa\n\nLoring has worked at Allsteel since 2005. Defendant Scott Mills was the\n\nvice president of operations at Allsteel and the supervisor of Dindinger’s\n\ndirect supervisor during this period.    The plaintiffs allege that during\n\ntheir time with the company, Allsteel paid them less than male\n\nemployees performing similar work.\n\f                                       3\n\n      Dindinger, Loring, and a third plaintiff (Elizabeth Freund) brought\n\nsuit against Allsteel in the United States District Court for the Southern\n\nDistrict of Iowa on October 10, 2011, alleging Allsteel had violated the\n\nFederal Equal Pay Act of 1963.         See 29 U.S.C. § 206(d) (2006).         On\n\nFebruary 28, 2012, plaintiffs amended their complaint to include claims\n\nby Dindinger and Loring that Allsteel had violated Iowa Code section\n\n216.6A, which was enacted in 2009 and expressly prohibits wage\n\ndiscrimination. See 2009 Iowa Acts ch. 96, § 2 (codified at Iowa Code\n\n§ 216.6A (2011)).         The amended complaint also included claims by\n\nDindinger and Loring that Allsteel had violated Federal Title VII and\n\nviolated the ICRA as it stood before 2009.           The amended complaint\n\nfurther recited that Dindinger and Loring had filed employment\n\ndiscrimination complaints with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission (ICRC)\n\non October 12, 2011, as required by Iowa Code section 216.16. See Iowa\n\nCode § 216.16(1). According to the complaint, the ICRC issued right-to-\n\nsue notices to Dindinger and Loring on December 29.                     See id.\n\n§ 216.16(2)(b), (3)(a).\n\n      On January 4, 2013, the defendants moved for partial summary\n\njudgment.     Among other things, the defendants urged the court to\n\ndismiss Loring and Dindinger’s claims under Iowa Code section 216.6A\n\nto the extent they arose before the effective date of that provision (July 1,\n\n2009). Dindinger and Loring countered that section 216.6A should apply\n\nretroactively and should permit them to recover lost wages for the entire\n\nperiod they were discriminatorily paid.\n\n      The court heard oral arguments on March 26, 2013. The district\n\ncourt’s   subsequent       September   3   certification   order   provides   the\n\nbackground to the present appeal:\n\f                                     4\n      At oral argument, the Court asked both sides whether\n      certifying questions of Iowa law to the Iowa Supreme Court\n      would be helpful. Both sides responded that their respective\n      positions were clearly correct and that certification was not\n      necessary. Defendants reevaluated their position, and filed a\n      Motion to Certify arguing that certification would aid in\n      untangling the issue of whether Section 216.6A and its\n      complementary subsection, Iowa Code § 216.15(9)(a)(9),\n      apply retroactively to plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs filed a\n      resistance, defendants filed a reply, and the Court issued its\n      Ruling Granting Defendants’ Motion to Certify. The Court\n      also, on its own motion, notified the parties that it may\n      certify the additional and alternative question of the\n      availability and length of time for Section 216.6 wage\n      discrimination damages . . . .\n\n(Footnote omitted.) (Citation omitted.)\n\n      After permitting the parties to submit briefs and proposed\n\nlanguage on the certification issues, the district court decided to certify\n\ntwo questions to this court to clarify Iowa law with respect to wage\n\ndiscrimination claims.\n\n      II. Standard of Review.\n\n      As we have said recently,\n\n             It is within our discretion to answer certified questions\n      from a United States district court. Iowa Code § 684A.1\n      (stating the court “may” answer a certified question). We\n      may answer a question certified to us when (1) a proper\n      court certified the question, (2) the question involves a\n      matter of Iowa law, (3) the question “may be determinative of\n      the cause . . . pending in the certifying court,” and (4) it\n      appears to the certifying court that there is no controlling\n      Iowa precedent. Id.\n\nLife Investors Ins. Co. of Am. v. Estate of Corrado, 838 N.W.2d 640, 643\n\n(Iowa 2013).\n\n      III. Analysis.\n\n      A. First Certified Question: Is Iowa Code Section 216.6A\n\nProspective or Retroactive? In 2009, the general assembly adopted an\n\nact “providing that wage discrimination is an unfair employment practice\n\nunder the Iowa civil rights Act and providing an enhanced remedy.”\n\f                                       5\n\n2009 Iowa Acts ch. 96, preamble. Among other things, the amendment\n\nadded a new section to the ICRA, section 216.6A. See id. § 2.\n\n      Previously, the ICRA made it an unfair or discriminatory practice\n\nfor an employer “to refuse to hire, accept, register, classify, or refer for\n\nemployment, to discharge any employee, or to otherwise discriminate in\n\nemployment . . . because of the age, race, creed, color, sex, sexual\n\norientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, or disability” of the\n\nemployee or job applicant. Iowa Code § 216.6(1)(a). The new section,\n\nsection 216.6A, provides as follows:\n\n          216.6A Additional unfair or discriminatory practice\n      — wage discrimination in employment.\n\n            1. a. The general assembly finds that the practice of\n      discriminating against any employee because of the age,\n      race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity,\n      national origin, religion, or disability of such employee by\n      paying wages to such employee at a rate less than the rate\n      paid to other employees does all of the following:\n\n             (1) Unjustly discriminates against the person receiving\n      the lesser rate.\n\n            (2) Leads to low employee morale, high turnover, and\n      frequent labor unrest.\n\n            (3) Discourages employees paid at lesser wage rates\n      from training for higher level jobs.\n\n           (4) Curtails employment opportunities,            decreases\n      employees’ mobility, and increases labor costs.\n\n           (5) Impairs purchasing power and threatens the\n      maintenance of an adequate standard of living by such\n      employees and their families.\n\n            (6) Prevents optimum utilization of the state’s available\n      labor resources.\n\n           (7) Threatens the well-being of citizens of this state\n      and adversely affects the general welfare.\n\n            b. The general assembly declares that it is the policy\n      of this state to correct and, as rapidly as possible, to\n      eliminate, discriminatory wage practices based on age, race,\n\f                                     6\n      creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national\n      origin, religion, and disability.\n\n             2. a. It shall be an unfair or discriminatory practice\n      for any employer or agent of any employer to discriminate\n      against any employee because of the age, race, creed, color,\n      sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin,\n      religion, or disability of such employee by paying wages to\n      such employee at a rate less than the rate paid to other\n      employees who are employed within the same establishment\n      for equal work on jobs, the performance of which requires\n      equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are\n      performed under similar working conditions. An employer or\n      agent of an employer who is paying wages to an employee at\n      a rate less than the rate paid to other employees in violation\n      of this section shall not remedy the violation by reducing the\n      wage rate of any employee.\n\n             b. For purposes of this subsection, an unfair or\n      discriminatory practice occurs when a discriminatory pay\n      decision or other practice is adopted, when an individual\n      becomes subject to a discriminatory pay decision or other\n      practice, or when an individual is affected by application of a\n      discriminatory pay decision or other practice, including each\n      time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid,\n      resulting in whole or in part from such a decision or other\n      practice.\n\nIowa Code § 216.6A(1)–(2).     The section goes on to delineate certain\n\naffirmative defenses for the employer:\n\n           3. It shall be an affirmative defense to a claim arising\n      under this section if any of the following applies:\n\n            a. Payment of wages is made pursuant to a seniority\n      system.\n\n            b. Payment of wages is made pursuant to a merit\n      system.\n\n           c. Payment of wages is made pursuant to a system\n      which measures earnings by quantity or quality of\n      production.\n\n           d. Pay differential is based on any other factor other\n      than the age, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation,\n      gender identity, national origin, religion, or disability of such\n      employee.\n\nId. § 216.6A(3).\n\f                                             7\n\n       The legislature simultaneously enacted a separate, enhanced\n\nremedy for violations of section 216.6A.               2009 Iowa Acts ch. 96, § 3\n\n(codified at Iowa Code § 216.15(9)(a)(9)). Specifically:\n\n             (9) For an unfair or discriminatory practice relating to\n       wage discrimination pursuant to section 216.6A, payment to\n       the complainant of damages for an injury caused by the\n       discriminatory or unfair practice which damages shall\n       include but are not limited to court costs, reasonable\n       attorney fees, and either of the following:\n\n             (a) An amount equal to two times the wage differential\n       paid to another employee compared to the complainant for\n       the period of time for which the complainant has been\n       discriminated against.\n\n             (b) In instances of willful violation, an amount equal to\n       three times the wage differential paid to another employee as\n       compared to the complainant for the period of time for which\n       the complainant has been discriminated against.\n\nIowa Code § 216.15(9)(a)(9).           In contrast, plaintiffs prevailing on any\n\nother ICRA claim are entitled to recover court costs, reasonable attorney\n\nfees, and “actual damages.” Id. § 216.15(9)(a)(8).\n\n       The first certified question requires us to determine whether\n\nsection 216.6A and the enhanced remedy in section 216.15(9)(a)(9)\n\nshould apply retroactively to claims arising before the statute’s July 1,\n2009 effective date. 1 “Legislative intent determines if a court will apply a\n\n\n\n       1The   certified question assumes these ICRA amendments became effective April\n28, 2009, i.e., the date the governor approved them. See 2009 Iowa Acts ch. 96\n(“Approved April 28, 2009.”). However, legislation passed at a regular session does not\ngo into effect until July 1 of the session year unless the legislature expressly provides\nfor a different date, and it did not do so here. See Iowa Const. art. III, § 26 (“An act of\nthe general assembly passed at a regular session of a general assembly shall take effect\non July 1 following its passage unless a different effective date is stated in an act of the\ngeneral assembly.”).\n        Another federal district court in Iowa has ruled that Iowa Code section 216.6A\napplies prospectively only. See Forster v. Deere & Co., 925 F. Supp. 2d 1056, 1065–66\n(N.D. Iowa 2013); Lenius v. Deere & Co., 924 F. Supp. 2d 1005, 1014–15 (N.D. Iowa\n2013). The court there concluded that “the statute created, defined, and regulated a\n\f                                        8\n\nstatute retrospectively or prospectively.” Iowa Beta Chapter of Phi Delta\n\nTheta Fraternity v. State, 763 N.W.2d 250, 266 (Iowa 2009). There is a\n\ngeneral    presumption      that    newly    enacted     statutes    apply    only\n\nprospectively.    See Iowa Code § 4.5 (“A statute is presumed to be\n\nprospective in its operation unless expressly made retrospective.”);\n\nFrideres v. Schiltz, 540 N.W.2d 261, 264 (Iowa 1995) (discussing the\n\nlegislative preference for prospectivity).         We have summarized the\n\nrelevant principles in the past:\n\n            It is well established that a statute is presumed to be\n      prospective only unless expressly made retrospective.\n      Statutes which specifically affect substantive rights are\n      construed to operate prospectively unless legislative intent to\n      the contrary clearly appears from the express language or by\n      necessary and unavoidable implication. Conversely, if the\n      statute relates solely to a remedy or procedure, it is\n      ordinarily applied both prospectively and retrospectively.\n\n             . . . Substantive law creates, defines and regulates\n      rights. Procedural law, on the other hand, is the practice,\n      method, procedure, or legal machinery by which the\n      substantive law is enforced or made effective. Finally, a\n      remedial statute is one that intends to afford a private\n      remedy to a person injured by a wrongful act. It is generally\n      designed to correct an existing law or redress an existing\n      grievance.\n\nAnderson Fin. Servs., LLC v. Miller, 769 N.W.2d 575, 578 (Iowa 2009)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The first step in determining whether a statute has retroactive\n\neffect is to assess whether the legislature expressly stated its intent that\n\na statute should apply retrospectively. Id. Here, the legislature did not\n\ninclude express language in section 216.6A to make it retroactive.\n\n\n\n___________________________________\nnew right.” Forster, 925 F. Supp. 2d at 1066; Lenius, 924 F. Supp. 2d at 1015. That\nruling, of course, is not binding on us.\n\f                                         9\n\n      The next step is to ascertain whether “the statute affects\n\nsubstantive rights or relates merely to a remedy.” Id. at 579. If the law\n\n“is substantive, we presume it operates prospectively only.” Id. If the\n\nstatute is remedial, we presume it operates retrospectively. Id. A statute\n\nis not remedial merely because one might say, colloquially, that its\n\npurpose is to “remedy” a defect in the law. See id. at 580. “[I]f a mere\n\nlegislative purpose to remedy a perceived defect in the law made a statute\n\nremedial, very few statutes would not fall within this classification.” Id.\n\nat 580 n.4. Thus, in Anderson Financial, our most recent foray into this\n\nsubject, we held that a cap on certain finance charges was not “remedial”\n\nbut   “substantive,”    because   it    effected   a   substantive   change   in\n\npermissible conduct. Id. at 580–81.\n\n      When a statute creates new rights or obligations, it is substantive\n\nrather than procedural or remedial.          See id. at 578, 580–81; see also\n\nDavis v. Jones, 247 Iowa 1031, 1033, 1035–36, 78 N.W.2d 6, 7–9 (1956)\n\n(holding a new statute enabling jurisdiction over certain nonresidents\n\ncould not be considered remedial or procedural because “a new right was\n\ncreated by the amendment”).            In Hiskey v. Maloney, we declined to\n\nretroactively apply a statute that established a new tax liability because\n\nretroactive application “does not extend to statutes creating new rights or\n\nimposing new obligations.” 580 N.W.2d 797, 799 (Iowa 1998). Despite\n\nthe fact the legislature characterized the statute in Hiskey as remedial,\n\nsuch “labeling . . . [does not] override the statutory presumption of\n\nprospective application . . . when the statute in question creates a new\n\npersonal liability.”   Id.   On the other hand, “we do allow a statute to\n\napply retrospectively when the statute provides an additional remedy to\n\nan already existing remedy or provides a remedy for an already existing\n\nloss.” Iowa Beta Chapter, 763 N.W.2d at 267.\n\f                                          10\n\n       Dindinger and Loring maintain that section 216.6A is not\n\nsubstantive.    They argue the section is merely procedural because it\n\nshifts the burden of proof from the employee to the employer.             They\n\nfurther contend section 216.6A is merely remedial because it provides an\n\nenhanced remedy—double or treble damages—for a preexisting cause of\n\naction of wage discrimination.\n\n       After careful consideration, we disagree with Dindinger and Loring.\n\nUnder preexisting law, unlawful discrimination occurred only when a\n\nperson was subjected to adverse treatment “because of” her membership\n\nin a protected class.    See Iowa Code § 216.6(1)(a).       It is true that the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas framework could assist the plaintiff in proving\n\ndiscriminatory intent by allowing an inference of intent and shifting the\n\nburden of production to the employer when the plaintiff makes a certain\n\nshowing. See, e.g., Jones v. Univ. of Iowa, 836 N.W.2d 127, 147–48 (Iowa\n\n2013) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct.\n\n1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)).            Yet if each side met its burden of\n\nproduction and made its required showing, the plaintiff still had the\n\nultimate burden of proving unlawful discrimination was “the real\n\nreason.”     Smidt v. Porter, 695 N.W.2d 9, 14–15 (Iowa 2005); see also\n\nFarmland Foods, Inc. v. Dubuque Human Rights Comm’n, 672 N.W.2d\n\n733, 741 n.1 (Iowa 2003) (“It is not necessary to follow the McDonnell\n\nDouglas analysis once a case has been fully tried because the burden\n\nultimately rests with the plaintiff to establish the claim and show the\n\nadverse employment action resulted from discrimination.”); Bd. of\n\nSupervisors of Buchanan Cnty. v. Iowa Civil Rights Comm’n, 584 N.W.2d\n\n252,   255     (Iowa   1998)   (stating    that   the   pre-2009   “employment\n\f                                         11\n\ndiscrimination provisions of chapter 216 . . . require a showing of intent\n\nto discriminate”). 2\n\n       In contrast, under section 216.6A of the Iowa Code, an employer\n\nthat pays lower wages for equal work to a person in a protected class\n\nviolates the law without regard to the employer’s intent. Note the distinct\n\nwording of section 216.6A.        It makes it illegal “to discriminate against\n\nany employee . . . by paying wages to such employee at a rate less than\n\nthe rate paid to other employees.”            Iowa Code § 216.6A(2)(a).       Thus,\n\nrather than requiring discrimination based on protected status to be\n\nindependently proved, section 216.6A defines discrimination as the act of\n\npaying lower wages. As the amicus curiae supporting the plaintiffs puts\n\nit,\n\n       [T]he Iowa Legislature enacted § 216.6A to ensure that all\n       forms of discrimination would be exposed and addressed—\n       even those that were falling through the cracks under\n       traditional discrimination analysis.\n\n              ....\n\n             Section 216.6A addresses this issue by including\n       additional remedies and making the claim intent-neutral.\n       Under § 216.6A, it does not matter why the wages are\n       discriminatorily less; it matters only that they are less.\n\n       Section 216.6A of the Iowa Code therefore creates an entirely new\n\ncause of action: strict liability on the part of employers for paying\n\nunequal wages.         Its wording is similar to the Federal Equal Pay Act.\n\nCompare id., with 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1) (2012) (providing that no\n\nemployer subject to the Act “shall discriminate . . . between employees on\n\n\n       2Of    course, prior law also recognized “disparate impact” claims. See Hy-Vee\nFood Stores, Inc. v. Iowa Civil Rights Comm’n, 453 N.W.2d 512, 517–18 (Iowa 1990).\nBut for such a claim, the plaintiff generally must show that “a particular employment\npractice has an adverse impact on a protected group.” Id. at 517. Thus, to establish\nliability, the plaintiff still had to prove more than a difference in wages.\n\f                                    12\n\nthe basis of sex by paying wages to employees . . . at a rate less than the\n\nrate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex”).        We\n\npreviously recognized that “[u]nlike Title VII and the employment\n\ndiscrimination provisions of chapter 216, which require a showing of\n\nintent to discriminate based on gender, the Equal Pay Act requires no\n\nshowing of discriminatory intent.” Bd. of Supervisors of Buchanan Cnty.,\n\n584 N.W.2d at 255; see also Bauer v. Curators of Univ. of Mo., 680 F.3d\n\n1043, 1045 (8th Cir. 2012) (contrasting the Equal Pay Act and Title VII,\n\nand noting that the former, “a strict liability statute, does not require\n\nplaintiffs to prove that an employer acted with discriminatory intent;\n\nplaintiffs need show only that an employer pays males more than\n\nfemales”).\n\n      The plaintiffs argue that, as a practical matter, section 216.6A of\n\nthe Iowa Code only shifts the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the\n\ndefendant because one of the statutory affirmative defenses allows the\n\nemployer to prove the wage differential was due to a factor other than the\n\nemployee’s protected status.    See Iowa Code § 216.6A(3)(d).     But this\n\ndoes not alter the fact that the legislation establishes a new cause of\n\naction with fewer elements than before. And it is not open to dispute\n\nthat there are some cases where the employee will be able to prevail now\n\nand would not have been able to prevail before. In that middle group,\n\nsection 216.6A imposes liability that did not previously exist.\n\n      In some ways, section 216.6A presents a clearer case for\n\nprospective-only operation than a law that made it easier to obtain\n\npersonal jurisdiction by personal service, see Davis, 247 Iowa at 1033–\n\n36, 78 N.W.2d at 7–9, or a law that imposed personal in addition to in\n\nrem liability for nonpayment of property taxes, see Hiskey, 580 N.W.2d\n\nat 798–99. Neither of those statutes altered the scope of what was and\n\f                                           13\n\nwas not permissible conduct under Iowa law. See id. at 798–99; Davis,\n\n247 Iowa at 1033–36, 78 N.W.2d at 7–9. Yet we considered both to be\n\nsubstantive rather than remedial or procedural changes.                     See Hiskey,\n\n580 N.W.2d at 799; Davis, 247 Iowa at 1036, 78 N.W.2d at 8–9; cf. State\n\nex rel. Turner v. Limbrecht, 246 N.W.2d 330, 333 (Iowa 1976) (finding that\n\nthe consumer fraud act had retroactive effect because “the attorney\n\ngeneral was still required to allege and prove reliance and damages,” and\n\n“[a]ccordingly we find no difference between the actionable fraud alleged\n\nby the attorney general and the common law action for fraud available to\n\ninjured parties on an individual basis prior to the advent of [the act]”),\n\noverruled on other grounds by State ex rel. Miller v. Hydro Mag, Ltd., 436\n\nN.W.2d 617, 622 (Iowa 1989). 3\n\n\n       3Dindinger  and Loring cite three cases where this court gave retroactive effect to\nlegislation. See City of Waterloo v. Bainbridge, 749 N.W.2d 245, 250–51 (Iowa 2008);\nIowa Comprehensive Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Fund Bd. v. Shell Oil Co., 606\nN.W.2d 370, 375–76 (Iowa 2000); Emmet Cnty. State Bank v. Reutter, 439 N.W.2d 651,\n653–54 (Iowa 1989). We find them distinguishable. The statute involved in Bainbridge\nwas “not a substantive statute.” 749 N.W.2d at 250–51. It simply had the effect of\nshortening the time for a tax sale buyer to exercise its option to give notice of the right\nof redemption. Id. The statute in Tank Fund, according to the legislative findings,\nestablished a clean-up fund for “past and existing petroleum leaks.” 606 N.W.2d at 375\n(emphasis omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). This “clearly revealed an intent\nfor the act to apply retroactively.” Id. at 376. The statute in Emmet County required\nstate banks that purchased land at a foreclosure sale to offer it to the prior owner on\nthe same terms before consummating any resale. 439 N.W.2d at 653. We noted that\nthe law referred to resales of “agricultural land held pursuant to this subsection” and\nthus “appl[ied] to agricultural land owned by a state bank on the effective date of the\namendment, regardless of when the land was acquired.” Id. at 654 (emphasis omitted)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n        In a sense, the laws in Bainbridge and Emmet County were not retroactive at all\nbecause they only set standards for conduct occurring after their enactment—i.e., a city\ncould seek title to abandoned land, Bainbridge, 749 N.W.2d at 250–51, and a state\nbank had to offer foreclosed property on the same terms to the prior owner before\nselling it to a new owner, Emmet Cnty., 439 N.W.2d at 653. Here, by contrast,\nDindinger and Loring seek to have the substantive law set forth in Iowa Code section\n216.6A applied to conduct that predated the enactment of the statute, i.e., things their\nemployer did or did not do before the law was adopted in 2009. In the Tank Fund case,\nthe legislature overcame the presumption of prospective-only operation by expressly\n\f                                          14\n\n       As the title of section 216.6A indicates, its purpose is to recognize\n\nan “[a]dditional unfair or discriminatory practice – wage discrimination in\n\nemployment.” Iowa Code § 216.6A (emphasis added); cf. In re Estate of\n\nSampson, 838 N.W.2d 663, 667 (Iowa 2013) (relying on section titles as\n\nan aid to interpretation); State v. Tague, 676 N.W.2d 197, 201–03 (Iowa\n\n2004) (same).         Liability for this additional practice creates a new\n\nobligation for employers.         Apparently, therefore, the general assembly\n\nbelieved it was making a substantive change in the law, which again, is\n\nthe trigger for a presumption of forward-only effect. See State v. Jones,\n\n298 N.W.2d 296, 298 (Iowa 1980) (“The legislature is presumed to know\n\nthe state of the law, including case law, at the time it enacts a statute.”);\n\nsee also Iowa Beta Chapter, 763 N.W.2d at 266 (“Legislative intent\n\ndetermines      if    a   court   will   apply    a   statute     retrospectively     or\n\nprospectively.”). 4\n\n       In sum, after taking into account (1) Iowa Code section 4.5, (2) our\n\nprecedent that substantive changes in the law are presumed to apply\n\nprospectively only, (3) the fact that section 216.6A creates a new strict\n\nliability cause of action for wage discrimination, and (4) the general\n\n___________________________________\nstating that the law applied to “past and existing” leaks.      606 N.W.2d at 375–76\n(emphasis omitted).\n       4The   plaintiffs also argue that we should follow federal precedent that has\napplied the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (FPA), Pub. L. No. 111–2, 123 Stat. 5\n(codified as amended in scattered sections of 29 U.S.C. and 42 U.S.C. (2012)),\namending federal civil rights law, retroactively to conduct that occurred before its 2009\nenactment. See, e.g., Kramer v. Bd. of Educ. of Balt. Cnty., 788 F. Supp. 2d 421, 426–\n28 (D. Md. 2011); Russell v. Cnty. of Nassau, 696 F. Supp. 2d 213, 227 (E.D.N.Y. 2010);\nSchengrund v. Pa. State Univ., 705 F. Supp. 2d 425, 432–33 (M.D. Pa. 2009). However,\ntwo distinctions should be noted. The FPA did not amend the underlying substantive\nlaw; it merely changed the statute of limitations. See Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act § 3\n(codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–5(e)). Further, the FPA is expressly retroactive; Congress\nprovided that it would take effect “as if enacted on May 28, 2007” and that it “appl[ied]\nto all claims of discrimination in compensation . . . that are pending on or after that\ndate.” Id. § 6 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–5).\n\f                                          15\n\nassembly’s own statement that it was legislating an “[a]dditional unfair or\n\ndiscriminatory practice,” Iowa Code § 216.6A, we conclude that section\n\n216.6A applies on a prospective basis only to conduct occurring after its\n\neffective date of July 1, 2009.\n\n       B. Second Certified Question: To What Extent May a Plaintiff\n\nRecover Damages for Wage Discrimination Under Iowa Code Section\n\n216.6?        Because we have concluded that Iowa Code section 216.6A\n\noperates prospectively and not retroactively, we now turn to the district\n\ncourt’s second certified question. This concerns the ability of plaintiffs to\n\nrecover damages for wage discrimination under the preexisting law,\n\nnamely, section 216.6. 5\n\n       Section 216.6 states in relevant part,\n\n       It shall be an unfair or discriminatory practice for any:\n\n              a. Person to refuse to hire, accept, register, classify, or\n       refer for employment, to discharge any employee, or to\n       otherwise discriminate in employment against any applicant\n       for employment or any employee because of the age, race,\n       creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national\n       origin, religion, or disability of such applicant or\n       employee . . . .\n\nIowa Code § 216.6(1)(a).            Prevailing plaintiffs can recover “actual\n\ndamages, court costs and reasonable attorney fees.”                       Iowa Code\n\n§ 216.15(9)(a)(8).\n\n\n\n       5The   defendants urge that the plaintiffs have not pled and thus have not\npreserved a wage discrimination claim under Iowa Code section 216.6 in federal court.\nHowever, resolving that question of federal court claim preservation is not our\nresponsibility.\n       As noted above, we do have discretion not to answer a certified question. See\nIowa Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Tooker, 808 N.W.2d 417, 427 (Iowa 2011). Here, we do\nnot have “a situation where the answers to the questions are fact-dependent or the facts\nare in conflict.” Id. Accordingly, we will answer the second question and leave any\nquestion of claim preservation to the federal district court to resolve.\n\f                                      16\n\n      Claims under section 216.6 are also subject to a limitations period:\n\n“[A] claim under this chapter shall not be maintained unless a complaint\n\nis filed with the [Iowa Civil Rights C]ommission within three hundred\n\ndays after the alleged discriminatory or unfair practice occurred.” Iowa\n\nCode § 216.15(13).       This provision mirrors similar language in federal\n\nlaw. Compare id., with 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–5(e)(1) (requiring a charge to\n\nbe filed “within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful\n\nemployment practice occurred” or “within three hundred days after the\n\nalleged unlawful employment practice occurred,” depending on the\n\nsituation).\n\n      We have no difficulty concluding that wage discrimination is\n\npotentially actionable under Iowa Code section 216.6.             The section\n\nprohibits an employer from “otherwise discriminat[ing] in employment.”\n\nIowa Code § 216.6(1)(a).        This catchall provision demonstrates the\n\nlegislature’s intent to prohibit all discriminatory practices relating to\n\nemployment       under    section   216.6,   even   those   not    specifically\n\nenumerated.      Payment of wages is a mainstay of any employment\n\nrelationship, and section 216.6 therefore encompasses discriminatory\n\npay practices.\n\n      For example, in a 1996 case before our court, a female plaintiff\n\nbrought a claim for loss of income, emotional distress, punitive damages,\n\nand attorney fees based on the allegation her employer paid her less than\n\nit paid men.     Dutcher v. Randall Foods, 546 N.W.2d 889, 891 (Iowa\n\n1996).    The employer did not cross-appeal, so “we accept[ed] as\n\nestablished that Randall violated the . . . Iowa Civil Rights Act by paying\n\nDutcher less than males in comparable positions.” Id. at 892; see also\n\nBd. of Supervisors of Buchanan Cnty., 584 N.W.2d at 258 (acknowledging\n\f                                    17\n\nthat pay disparities could be evidence of gender-based discrimination for\n\npurposes of proving a claim under the ICRA).\n\n      We now turn to the real question in controversy—namely, the time\n\nperiod for which damages are recoverable. Dindinger and Loring argue\n\nthat they should be able to recover for the entire period they were subject\n\nto discrimination in pay, so long as at least one paycheck fell within the\n\n300 days prior to their filing a complaint with the commission. Allsteel\n\nand Mills urge us to conclude that the employer’s initial pay-setting\n\ndecisions were the relevant discriminatory practices, and because\n\nDindinger and Loring filed complaints with the commission more than\n\n300 days thereafter, their claims are time-barred. For reasons explained\n\nbelow, we adopt neither position, and instead conclude each paycheck is\n\na discriminatory practice and a new 300-day limitations period applies to\n\neach check. This is essentially the view of the dissenters in Ledbetter v.\n\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 643–45, 127 S. Ct. 2162,\n\n2178–79, 167 L. Ed. 2d 982, 1001–03 (2007) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting),\n\nsuperseded by statute, Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. No.\n\n111-2, 123 Stat. 5 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 29\n\nU.S.C. and 42 U.S.C.), and we believe it is both logical and consistent\n\nwith Iowa precedent.\n\n      We begin by reviewing our relevant caselaw and its interplay with\n\nintervening decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Our narrative\n\nbegins in 1990, when we addressed an ICRA claim brought by a woman\n\nof Vietnamese heritage who, for years, had been passed over for\n\nadditional hours or for promotion. See Hy-Vee Food Stores, Inc. v. Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Comm’n, 453 N.W.2d 512, 528–29 (Iowa 1990).         While the\n\nplaintiff established a prima facie case of employment discrimination\n\nbased on national origin, the record also showed that the employer\n\f                                       18\n\nsexually segregated its work force, reserving stocker positions (that were\n\nneeded for promotion) to men. Id. at 521–24.\n\n      We      rejected   the   employer’s   argument   that   the   employee’s\n\ncomplaint was untimely because the discriminatory conduct began\n\noutside the limitations period in Iowa Code section 601A.15 (1983), even\n\nthough it continued into that period. Id. at 527–30. We elaborated on\n\nthe elements of a continuing violation by analogizing to federal cases\n\ndecided under the ICRA’s federal counterpart, Title VII. See id. at 528–\n\n29. We stated,\n\n      [T]he “continuing violation” doctrine does not excuse\n      compliance with the time limits for filing a charge. But if a\n      violation is continuing, the time does not begin to run when\n      the discrimination first happens. Instead the action is\n      considered filed in time if there are discriminatory acts\n      within the limitations period.\n\nId. at 527.\n\n      Relying primarily on decisions of federal courts of appeals, we went\n\non to describe two types of continuing violations, “a series of acts with\n\none independent discriminatory act occurring within the charge-filing\n\nperiod” and the “maintenance of a system or policy which discriminates.”\n\nId. at 528 (internal quotation marks omitted). We explained that the first\n\n“series of acts” type of continuing violation is discerned by a multifactor\n\napproach that considers whether the conduct is recurring and frequent,\n\nyet seemingly nonpermanent. See id. at 528–29. We upheld the ICRC’s\n\nfindings that the employer’s national origin discrimination was a\n\ncontinuing violation under the first theory, and its sex discrimination\n\nwas a continuing violation under the second theory. Id. at 528–30.\n\n      Without further discussing the continuing violation doctrine, we\n\nthen upheld the ICRC’s decision to award back pay to the employee for\n\f                                           19\n\nthe entire time period when the employer failed to promote her or give her\n\nfull-time status. Id. at 530–32.\n\n       Twelve years after our decision in Hy-Vee Food Stores, the United\n\nStates Supreme Court issued a decision that clarified when the\n\ncontinuing         violation    doctrine   applies    in    federal    employment\n\ndiscrimination cases.          Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S.\n\n101, 111, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 2071, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106, 120–21 (2002).\n\nThat case involved an African-American employee of Amtrak who alleged\n\nhe had been subjected to repeated acts of racial discrimination. Id. at\n\n105, 122 S. Ct. at 2068, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 117.\n\n       The Court there rejected the idea that a series of related but\n\nseparate acts constituted a continuing violation. Id. at 111, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2071, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 120–21 (“There is simply no indication that the\n\nterm ‘[employment] practice’ converts related discrete acts into a single\n\nunlawful practice for the purposes of timely filing.”) The Court explained,\n\n“[D]iscrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even\n\nwhen they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges.                  Each\n\ndiscrete discriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges alleging\n\nthat act.”    Id. at 113, 122 S. Ct. at 2072, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 122.\n\nSignificantly, the Court quoted with approval a prior decision holding\n\nthat “ ‘[e]ach week’s paycheck that deliver[ed] less to a black than to a\n\nsimilarly situated white is a wrong actionable under Title VII . . . .’ ” Id.\n\nat 112, 122 S. Ct. at 2071, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 121 (quoting Bazemore v.\n\nFriday, 478 U.S. 385, 395, 106 S. Ct. 3000, 3006, 92 L. Ed. 2d 315, 328\n\n(1986) (per curiam)). 6        In short, the Supreme Court clarified that an\n\n\n       6Notably,  after Morgan, lower federal courts stopped applying the continuing\nviolation theory to wage discrimination cases. See 2 Emp’t Discrimination Coordinator:\nAnalysis of Fed. Law § 73:22 (2014), available at www.westlaw.com (“Although prior to\n\f                                         20\n\nindependently actionable act of discrimination cannot be combined with\n\nother independently actionable acts (even of the same type) to create a\n\ncontinuing violation.\n\n       While the Morgan Court unanimously found that the continuing\n\nviolation rule did not apply to discrete acts of discrimination, a majority\n\nof the Court would allow it to apply to hostile work environment claims,\n\nnoting that such claims were “different in kind from discrete acts.” Id. at\n\n113–15, 122 S. Ct. at 2072–73, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 122–23.                  The Court\n\nexplained that a hostile work environment claim “cannot be said to occur\n\non any particular day,” but “occurs over a series of days or perhaps\n\nyears” and is “based on the cumulative effect of individual acts.” Id. at\n\n115, 122 S. Ct. at 2073, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 123.                    A single act of\n\nharassment may not rise to the level of an actionable hostile work\n\nenvironment claim. See id.\n\n       Before our court had the chance to address the continuing\n\nviolation theory again in light of Morgan, the United States Court of\n\nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit decided Madison v. IBP, Inc., 330 F.3d\n\n1051 (8th Cir. 2003) (decision on remand). In Madison, the plaintiff had\n\nobtained a pre-Morgan recovery in federal court under both Title VII and\n\nthe ICRA that was originally affirmed by the Eighth Circuit. See Madison\n\nv. IBP, Inc., 257 F.3d 780, 784 (8th Cir. 2001).             The Supreme Court\n\nsubsequently vacated for reconsideration in light of Morgan. Madison v.\n\nIBP, Inc., 536 U.S. 919, 919, 122 S. Ct. 2583, 2584, 153 L. Ed. 2d 773,\n\n773 (2002).     The Eighth Circuit then concluded that Morgan did not\n\n___________________________________\nMorgan many cases held that wage claims based on unequal pay for equal work (as\nopposed to a failure to promote case) should be treated as continuing violations, post\nMorgan cases now hold that the doctrine is no longer truly applicable to wage cases.”\n(Footnotes omitted.)).\n\f                                    21\n\naffect the ICRA recovery.

It\n\nreasoned   that    although   Morgan had    limited   applicability   of   the\n\ncontinuing violation theory under federal employment discrimination\n\nlaw, Iowa had followed a separate course. Id. The Eighth Circuit said,\n\n      In [Hy-Vee Food Stores, 453 N.W.2d at 530–31,] the Iowa\n      Supreme Court adopted the continuing violation doctrine,\n      permitting recovery for the entire period an employee’s rights\n      have been violated if at least one act of illegal discrimination\n      occurred within the [required] period before a complaint was\n      filed . . . .\n\nId. at 1054.\n\n      Dindinger and Loring rely heavily on Hy-Vee Food Stores and\n\nMadison.       However, six months after Madison, we reexamined and\n\nclarified the scope of the continuing violation doctrine under the ICRA.\n\nSee Farmland Foods, 672 N.W.2d at 740–41. Farmland Foods involved\n\nclaims by an African-American employee of a meat packing plant that he\n\nhad been repeatedly discriminated against over a fifteen-year period. Id.\n\nat 737–40.      Among other things, the employee alleged Farmland had\n\ndiscriminated against him with respect to work assignments, work\n\nhours, and discipline.    Id. at 738–39.    “[M]ost of the evidence . . .\n\nconcerned events that predated” the applicable statute of limitations. Id.\n\nat 741.\n\n      We made clear that notwithstanding Hy-Vee Food Stores, the\n\ncontinuing violation doctrine “applies differently to claims of discrete\n\ndiscriminatory acts than to claims of hostile work environment.”\n\nFarmland Foods, 672 N.W.2d at 741 (citing Morgan, 536 U.S. at 110–21,\n\n122 S. Ct. at 2070–76, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 120–27); see also Hy-Vee Food\n\nStores, 453 N.W.2d at 527–29. Following the Supreme Court’s lead in\n\nMorgan, we said that “[e]ach discrete discriminatory act or event is\n\nseparately actionable, and a claim based on discrimination must be filed\n\f                                     22\n\nwithin the relevant limitation period.” Farmland Foods, 672 N.W.2d at\n\n741. “This is true,” we added, “even when the discrete discriminatory act\n\nrelates to other acts alleged in a timely filed complaint.” Id.\n\n      On this basis, we rejected the employee’s racial discrimination\n\nclaims as time-barred.    Id. at 743.     We considered each act of alleged\n\ndiscrimination on its own and noted that while some complained-of\n\nincidents had occurred within the limitations period, none of those\n\nmatters amounted to a materially adverse employment action.           Id. at\n\n742–43. Separately, we acknowledged that the employee’s hostile work\n\nenvironment claim could proceed on a continuing violation theory,\n\nbecause such claims “involve repeated conduct and are based on the\n\ncumulative impact of separate acts.” Id. at 741 (citing Morgan, 536 U.S.\n\nat 115, 122 S. Ct. at 2073, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 123). But, we found no\n\nsubstantial evidence to support that claim, even when considering the\n\ntotality of the employer’s conduct for the duration of the employee’s\n\nemployment. Id. at 743–46.\n\n      Thus, in Farmland Foods, we adopted the “discrete acts” approach\n\nthat had won the Supreme Court’s unanimous approval in Morgan. Id.\n\nat 741; see also Morgan, 536 U.S. at 110–21, 122 S. Ct. at 2070–76, 153\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 120–27.        If an employer commits a discrete act of\n\ndiscrimination that can be the basis for a civil rights action, the statute\n\nof limitations begins to run on that act, even if the act is repeated and in\n\nthat sense continues.\n\n      Four years after Farmland Foods, the United States Supreme Court\n\nrendered its controversial Ledbetter decision.     See Ledbetter, 550 U.S.\n\n618, 127 S. Ct. 2162, 167 L. Ed. 2d 982 (Alito, J., majority opinion).\n\nThat case involved an employee who, for many years, had been paid less\n\nthan her male counterparts, allegedly because of discriminatory reviews\n\f                                      23\n\nby her supervisors. Id. at 621–22, 127 S. Ct. at 2165–66, 167 L. Ed. 2d\n\nat 988–89. She had abandoned any claim under the Equal Pay Act and\n\nwas only pursuing relief under Title VII. Id. at 621, 127 S. Ct. at 2165,\n\n167 L. Ed. 2d at 988.       By a five-to-four margin, the Court held the\n\ndiscriminatory act that triggered the Title VII limitations period was the\n\npay-setting decision, not the issuance of the discriminatory paycheck,\n\nand a plaintiff who did not file within the required period after the pay-\n\nsetting decision could not recover at all. See id. at 621, 643, 127 S. Ct.\n\nat 2165, 2178, 167 L. Ed. 2d at 988, 1001.\n\n        Justice Ginsburg, dissenting with three other justices, urged that\n\n“each payment of a wage or salary infected by sex-based discrimination\n\nconstitutes an unlawful employment practice.” Id. at 646, 127 S. Ct. at\n\n2179, 167 L. Ed. 2d at 1003 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).         Her dissent\n\nfurther noted that in a prior case, the Supreme Court “unanimously held\n\nthat an employer . . . committed an unlawful employment practice each\n\ntime it paid black employees less than similarly situated white\n\nemployees.” Id., 127 S. Ct. at 2179–80, 167 L. Ed. 2d at 1003–04 (citing\n\nBazemore, 478 U.S. at 395, 106 S. Ct. at 3006, 92 L. Ed. 2d at 328).\n\n        The year after Ledbetter, we decided State ex rel. Claypool v. Evans,\n\n757 N.W.2d 166 (Iowa 2008).        Claypool was a housing discrimination\n\ncase. A condominium owner maintained that a developer had engaged in\n\ndisability discrimination by selling a condominium that was not\n\naccessible to him in light of his progressive joint degeneration and\n\ndifficulty with walking. Id. at 167–68. Although the complainant bought\n\nthe condominium in 1999, he did not file a complaint with the ICRC until\n\n2002.     Id. at 167.    To try to surmount the developer’s statute of\n\nlimitations defense, the ICRC and the complainant relied on the\n\ncontinuing violation theory. Id. at 171.\n\f                                    24\n\n      We rejected that theory, noting that “the specific discriminatory\n\npractice was the sale of a housing unit designed and constructed to be\n\ninaccessible to a person with disabilities.” Id. at 172. We added, “This\n\ndiscriminatory practice was complete upon the sale.”         Id.   We also\n\ndiscussed the Ledbetter decision, commenting that it “focused on the\n\nissue of continuing violation versus continuing effect.”    Id. at 171–72\n\n(citing Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at 624–28, 127 S. Ct. at 2167–69, 167\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 990–93 (Alito, J., majority opinion)). We observed that the\n\nhousing case before us involved “a continuing effect of the discriminatory\n\npractice rather than a continuing violation.” Id. at 172. Still, we did not\n\nadopt the specific holding of Ledbetter, and Dindinger and Loring\n\ncorrectly point out that Claypool is distinguishable on its facts from a\n\nwage discrimination case because there clearly could not have been a\n\ndiscriminatory practice committed by the developer after it sold the\n\ncondominium in 1999. See id. at 167.\n\n      The next year, approximately three months before our general\n\nassembly amended the ICRA to add section 216.6A, Congress overturned\n\nLedbetter by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (FPA). The\n\nFPA provides that “an unlawful employment practice occurs . . . when an\n\nindividual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation decision or\n\nother practice, . . . including each time wages, benefits, or other\n\ncompensation is paid.” Id. at § 3 (codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000e–5(e)), The\n\nFPA also allows the victim of discrimination to recover back pay for up to\n\ntwo years preceding the filing of the charge. Id.\n\n      From the foregoing narrative, we can distill three lessons. First, in\n\nFarmland Foods, we aligned ourselves with the unanimous view of the\n\nSupreme Court in Morgan that the continuing violation doctrine does not\n\napply to cases involving discrete discriminatory acts, as opposed to\n\f                                    25\n\nhostile work environment claims. See Farmland Foods, 672 N.W.2d at\n\n741; see also Morgan, 536 U.S. at 114–18, 122 S. Ct. at 2073–75, 153\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 122–25.      Discrete discriminatory acts are “separately\n\nactionable,” not a basis for invoking the continuing violation theory. Id.\n\nSecond, if there is no discriminatory act but only an effect of a past\n\ndiscriminatory act within the limitations period, then the claim is time-\n\nbarred. See Claypool, 757 N.W.2d at 171–72. Third, conduct that is not\n\nseparately actionable but may become actionable based upon its\n\n“cumulative impact” may be pursued on a continuing violation theory if\n\nsome of the conduct occurred within the limitations period.            See\n\nFarmland Foods, 672 N.W.2d at 741.\n\n      All of these principles are consistent with the language of the ICRA,\n\nwhich requires the complaint to be filed with the ICRC “within three\n\nhundred days after the alleged discriminatory or unfair practice\n\noccurred.” Iowa Code § 216.15(13) (2011). Under this wording, which is\n\nsimilar to the federal wording, the relevant unit of analysis is the\n\n“discriminatory or unfair practice.” Compare id., with Lilly Ledbetter Fair\n\nPay Act § 3 (codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000e–5(e)).         If more than one\n\ndiscriminatory act has occurred, even if the same type of act is being\n\nrepeated, the timeliness of each act should be evaluated individually. If\n\nonly one act has occurred, it is sufficient if some of the relevant conduct\n\noccurred within the limitations period.\n\n      The question then is how to classify the act of paying a female\n\nemployee less than her male counterpart where the discriminatory\n\nreasons for the wage discrepancy originated somewhere in the past. Is\n\nthe too-low paycheck (1) a discrete act of discrimination, (2) merely an\n\neffect of prior discrimination, or (3) conduct that, to be actionable, must\n\nbe weighed in its overall impact with other conduct?\n\f                                           26\n\n       We think the paycheck falls in the first category.                    Paying an\n\nemployee in a protected class less than other employees, if done with\n\ndiscriminatory intent, is always separately actionable. It does not matter\n\nhow many times the conduct occurred, and one does not need to\n\nconsider other conduct to determine whether the employer has violated\n\nthe law.     Thus, under Farmland Foods, the limitations analysis goes\n\npaycheck by paycheck.            672 N.W.2d at 741.            A discriminatory pay\n\npractice does not become more discriminatory each time a new check is\n\npaid, unlike a series of harassing incidents that may only amount to a\n\nhostile work environment when accumulated.                  A paycheck is precisely\n\nthe type of discrete practice that we envisioned in Farmland Foods when\n\nwe distinguished discrete acts from violations based on cumulative\n\nconduct. Id. 7\n\n       On the other hand, we do not agree with the Ledbetter majority (or\n\nthe defendants here) that an employer’s issuance of a smaller paycheck\n\nto a protected class employee is merely an “effect” of a prior pay-setting\n\ndecision, as opposed to an independent discriminatory act.                            See\n\nLedbetter, 550 U.S. at 621, 624–25, 127 S. Ct. at 2165, 2167, 167\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 988, 990. Payment is itself an act; this is not like Claypool\nwhere the developer sold the condominium and, after the sale, could not\n\n       7We note that under Iowa Code section 614.1(8), the same result would follow if\n\nthe employer failed to pay wages to an employee. The employee may recover only for\nthose nonpayments that took place within the limitations period. See Gabelmann v.\nNFO, Inc., 571 N.W.2d 476, 482 (Iowa 1997).\n        In 2009, the legislature provided a different statute of limitations for claims\nunder Iowa Code section 216.6A, allowing the employee to recover “for the period of\ntime for which the complainant has been discriminated against.” 2009 Iowa Acts ch.\n96, § 3 (codified at Iowa Code § 216.15(9)(a)(9)(a)). This language appears to allow the\nemployee to recover for the entire period of discrimination, so long as some equal pay\nviolation occurred within 300 days of the employee’s administrative complaint. But the\nfact that the legislature inserted this language for section 216.6A claims suggests that it\ndid not believe the existing language in section 216.15 had that effect.\n\f                                          27\n\nhave committed discriminatory acts with respect to that condominium.\n\nSee 757 N.W.2d at 172. The law frequently, as in the case of the ICRA,\n\nrequires a combination of an act and intent to impose liability. Yet, the\n\ntwo do not have to arise at the same time so long as they are connected.\n\nFor example, would an employer that hired a new female employee be\n\nable to escape liability simply because it based her low compensation on\n\na discriminatory pay scale it had adopted ten years before? Clearly not. 8\n\n       A pay-setting decision alone is not actionable unless accompanied\n\nby unequal payments. Accordingly, it seems unfair to tie the statute of\n\nlimitations to an event that, by itself, would be insufficient to trigger\n\nliability. At the same time, an employer may reasonably be held liable for\n\nfailing to pay an employee properly at any time within the limitations\n\nperiod, since the employer always has the ability to reexamine and\n\ncorrect an improper pay-setting decision.\n\n       Other state courts, applying their own states’ civil rights laws, have\n\ndetermined      that   disparate     paychecks      are    discrete   discriminatory\n\npractices.     For example, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts\n\ndeclined to apply the continuing violation theory to unequal pay claims\n\nunder its state equal rights law. See Silvestris v. Tantasqua Reg’l Sch.\n\nDist., 847 N.E.2d 328, 338 (Mass. 2006).                  In Silvestris, two female\n\nteachers brought an action against a school district, alleging they were\n\n       8When  interpreting the ICRA, we have not always followed federal interpretations\nof similar language in the federal civil rights statutes. See Goodpaster v. Schwan’s\nHome Serv., Inc., 849 N.W.2d 1, 11–13 (Iowa 2014) (concluding multiple sclerosis can be\na disability under the ICRA). Departure from federal precedent in this case is\nappropriate. The United States Supreme Court’s decision in Ledbetter, we believe, is\ninconsistent with the language of the ICRA, with Morgan, and with Farmland Foods.\nOur decision in Farmland Foods treats each independent discriminatory act as a\nseparate unit for statute of limitations purposes. 672 N.W.2d at 741. Discrete acts of\ndiscrimination do not become timely merely because they have been repeated, or\nuntimely merely because they have occurred before.\n\f                                    28\n\npaid less than their male counterparts. Id. at 330. The court ultimately\n\nfound no violation of the Massachusetts equal rights law, but in doing so,\n\nit determined the continuing violation theory should not apply to\n\nunequal compensation claims under state law. See id. at 338, 343. The\n\ncourt decided each paycheck should be treated as a discrete act because\n\n“[a]n alleged inequality can be identified on examination of individual\n\npaychecks, rather than on the evaluation of ongoing wrongful conduct.”\n\nId. at 338.   It noted that applying the continuing violation doctrine\n\n“would eviscerate the one-year statute of limitations set forth in” the\n\nstatute. Id. at 338–39. It therefore concluded that pay claims give rise to\n\na cause of action subject to its own statute of limitations period each\n\ntime a paycheck is issued. See id. at 339.\n\n      The New Jersey Supreme Court similarly concluded that under its\n\nstate wage discrimination law, each payment of unequal wages was an\n\nactionable wrong subject to a two-year statute of limitations. Alexander\n\nv. Seton Hall Univ., 8 A.3d 198, 199 (N.J. 2010). Three female professors\n\nbrought an action against Seton Hall University alleging unequal pay on\n\nthe basis of sex and age.     Id. at 200.    The lower court followed the\n\nLedbetter majority and dismissed the professors’ claims as untimely\n\nbecause they had not been filed within two years of the pay-setting\n\ndecision. See id. at 199. The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed. Id. at\n\n199–200. It declined to follow the approach of the Ledbetter majority and\n\nalso declined to apply the continuing violation doctrine to wage\n\ndiscrimination claims.   Id. at 205–06.      Instead, it adopted the same\n\nanalysis we follow today, noting it had previously approved the rationale\n\nof Morgan, which distinguished between discrete acts of discrimination\n\nand hostile work environment claims. See id. at 203 (citing Morgan, 536\n\f                                     29\n\nU.S. at 115, 122 S. Ct. at 2073–74, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 123). The court\n\nconcluded,\n\n      Each payment of such discriminatory wages thus constitutes\n      a renewed separable and actionable wrong that is remediable\n      under the [wage discrimination law]. The two-year statute of\n      limitations applies to such violations, cutting off the\n      untimely portion and, as a result, operating as a limit on the\n      back period for which a plaintiff may seek recovery . . . .\n\nId. at 207. The court therefore held the plaintiffs’ claims were timely with\n\nrespect only to paychecks received in the two years immediately\n\npreceding the filing of the lawsuit. Id.\n\n      In Zuurbier v. Medstar Health, Inc., a female physician alleged pay\n\ndiscrimination under the District of Columbia’s human rights act. 895\n\nA.2d 905, 906 (D.C. 2006). The United States Court of Appeals for the\n\nD.C. Circuit followed the logic of Morgan to conclude that each\n\ndiscriminatory paycheck was a discrete act subject to its own limitations\n\nperiod. Id. at 910–14. The court therefore limited the plaintiff’s recovery\n\nto the three paychecks received within the applicable limitations period.\n\nId. at 914.\n\n      The chief legal counsel of the Illinois Department of Human Rights\n\nhas also stated that each paycheck is a discrete incident for purposes of\n\nwage discrimination claims under Illinois law.       Budzileni v. Dep’t of\n\nHuman Rights, 910 N.E.2d 1190, 1200 (Ill. App. Ct. 2009). On appeal,\n\nthe petitioner in that case conceded that her claims for paychecks\n\nreceived outside the limitations period were untimely. See id. at 1206.\n\n      In a 2003 case, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme\n\nCourt relied heavily on then-existing federal precedent to determine that\n\nalthough each paycheck constitutes a separate harm subject to its own\n\nlimitations period, the statute of limitations does not prevent a plaintiff\n\nfrom introducing evidence of unequal pay that occurred outside the\n\f                                      30\n\nlimitations period to establish her prima facie case. Kent v. Papert Cos.,\n\n764 N.Y.S.2d 675, 679–80 (App. Div. 2003). We are unaware of the New\n\nYork appellate courts changing their position in light of Ledbetter.\n\n        Other courts have pursued different approaches to unequal pay\n\nclaims based on their respective state-law statutes and precedents. In\n\nPrairie View A&M University v. Chatha, the Texas Supreme Court\n\nfollowed the rationale espoused in the Ledbetter majority that the pay-\n\nsetting decision triggers the limitations period while subsequent\n\npaychecks are merely lingering effects of the discrimination. 381 S.W.3d\n\n500, 510 (Tex. 2012). The court referenced a previous case in which it\n\nheld the limitations period for employment discrimination “commences\n\n‘when     the   employee   is   informed   of   the   allegedly   discriminatory\n\nemployment decision, not when that decision comes to fruition.’ ” Id. at\n\n505 (quoting Specialty Retailers v. DeMoranville, 933 S.W.2d 490, 493\n\n(Tex. 1996)). Based on the logic of this prior case, the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt concluded this “rule applies with equal force in the context of pay\n\ndiscrimination decisions.”      Id. at 509.     It held only the pay-setting\n\ndecision was a discrete act and “[s]ubsequent paychecks . . . are merely\n\nconsequences of past discrimination.” Id. at 510.\n\n        In contrast to the Texas approach, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals\n\nrecently applied the continuing violation principle to wage discrimination\n\nclaims.    Rice Lake Harley Davidson v. State, 855 N.W.2d 882, 893–94\n\n(Wis. Ct. App. 2014).      The court noted that Wisconsin had chosen to\n\napply the continuing violation theory to unequal pay claims nearly\n\ntwenty years earlier, before Morgan was decided. See id. at 893 (citing\n\nAbbyland Processing v. State, 557 N.W.2d 419, 422 (Wis. 1996)).             The\n\ncourt declined to follow intervening federal interpretations of wage\n\f                                   31\n\ndiscrimination cases and instead adhered to prior authority of the\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court. See id. at 894–95.\n\n       Because of specific Ohio statutory language, the Ohio Supreme\n\nCourt has applied the continuing violation doctrine to its state wage\n\ndiscrimination law. See Featzka v. Millcraft Paper Co., 405 N.E.2d 264,\n\n266–67 (Ohio 1980). Ohio law provides for recovery “ ‘from the date of\n\nthe commencement of the violation.’ ” Id. at 266 (quoting Ohio Rev. Code\n\nAnn. § 4111.17(D)). The court relied on this language to conclude, “the\n\nlegislature clearly indicated its intent to permit recovery from the\n\nbeginning of the prohibited discrimination until its termination.” Id. at\n\n267.   Similarly, in a certified question from the Eastern District of\n\nTennessee, the Supreme Court of Tennessee determined that wage\n\ndiscrimination claims under Tennessee law were continuing violations.\n\nBooker v. Boeing Co., 188 S.W.3d 639, 641 (Tenn. 2006). It reached this\n\nconclusion based on the language of the state human rights act, which\n\nallowed recovery if a claim was filed within one year “ ‘after the alleged\n\ndiscriminatory practice ceases.’ ” Id. at 642 (quoting Tenn. Code. Ann.\n\n§ 4–21–311(d) (2005)).   The court contrasted this wording with that of\n\nTitle VII, which allowed recovery within a set period “ ‘after the alleged\n\nunlawful employment practice occurred.’ ” Id. at 648 (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n\n2000e–5(e)(1)). The court reasoned a discriminatory pay rate “does not\n\ncease each time an employee receives a paycheck” but only “when the\n\nemployer brings the employee into parity with his or her peers.” Id. at\n\n648.   Therefore, the court determined the legislature had intended to\n\nincorporate   the   continuing   violation   doctrine   into   the   wage\n\ndiscrimination statute by using the word “ceases.” See id.\n\n       Except for the new cause of action added in 2009, the ICRA does\n\nnot have language as in Ohio or Tennessee that would allow the claimant\n\f                                           32\n\nto revert to the date when the employer initially discriminated against the\n\nemployee. And unlike Wisconsin, we have expressly adopted the discrete\n\nacts approach to the statute of limitations set forth in Morgan.                      See\n\nFarmland Foods, 672 N.W.2d at 741.                  We therefore believe that the\n\nDistrict of Columbia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York\n\nhave it right: Separate discriminatory paychecks should be evaluated\n\nseparately for limitations purposes. See Zuurbier, 895 A.2d at 910–14;\n\nBudzileni, 910 N.E.2d at 1200 (noting the chief legal counsel’s\n\ninstruction that “each alleged payment of unequal wages [is] a separate\n\nand discrete incident”); Silvestris, 847 N.E.2d at 338; Alexander, 8 A.3d\n\nat 207; Kent, 764 N.Y.S.2d at 679. 9\n\n       9Dindinger   and Loring also rely on a longstanding ICRC regulation, which\nprovides:\n               3.3(2) Continuing violation. If the alleged unlawful discriminatory\n       practice or act is of a continuing nature, the date of the occurrence of the\n       alleged unlawful practice shall be deemed to be any date subsequent to\n       the commencement of the alleged unlawful practice up to and including\n       the date upon which the unlawful practice has ceased.\nIowa Admin. Code r. 161—3.3(2). We agree with Allsteel and Mills that this regulation\nessentially restates the present question without answering it. The question remains:\nWere there multiple discriminatory acts or was there one act of a continuing nature?\nNotably, when we addressed the continuing violation theory in Claypool, we did not give\nany deference to the ICRC’s views or cite to this regulation. See 757 N.W.2d at 169,\n171–72 (reviewing for correction of errors at law).\n        In Renda v. Iowa Civil Rights Commission, a case involving the ICRC, we\ndiscussed at length when judicial deference is owed to an administrative agency’s\nstatutory interpretation. See 784 N.W.2d 8, 10–15 (Iowa 2010); see also Iowa Code\n§§ 17A.19(10)(c), (l). We emphasized that “each case requires a careful look at the\nspecific language the agency has interpreted as well as the specific duties and authority\ngiven to the agency with respect to enforcing particular statutes.” Renda, 784 N.W.2d\nat 13. We have given deference to agency interpretations of “a substantive term within\nthe special expertise of the agency,” but not a term with “an independent legal definition\nthat is not uniquely within the subject matter expertise of the agency.” Id. at 14.\nThere, we ultimately concluded the ICRC was not clearly vested with authority to\ninterpret the terms “employee” and “dwelling.” See id. at 14–15. Here, the question is\nreally one of interpreting the term “practice”—do we have one or more than one? Like\nthe definitions of employee and dwelling, this matter is not uniquely within the\nexpertise of the ICRC. Hence, we believe the ICRC’s regulation would not be entitled to\ndeference, even if it answered the question.\n\f                                           33\n\n       For all these reasons, we conclude an employee can assert a wage\n\ndiscrimination claim under Iowa Code section 216.6. The plaintiff’s lost-\n\nincome recovery is based upon pay that should have been received within\n\nthe 300-day limitations period set forth in Iowa Code section 216.15(13).\n\n       IV. Conclusion.\n\n       We have provided the answers to the certified questions as set\n\nforth above. Costs shall be equally divided between the parties.

They\n\nare:\n\n              1. Do Iowa Code section 216.6A, Iowa’s equal pay law,\n       and the accompanying remedial language in section\n       216.15(9)(a)(9), apply to permit a plaintiff to pursue wage\n       discrimination claims under section 216.6A that accrued\n       before April 28, 2009, the date Iowa’s General Assembly\n       made these statutes effective, in the absence of express\n       legislative language making these laws retroactive?\n\n            2. If a prevailing plaintiff may only recover damages\n       under Iowa Code section 216.6A and the accompanying\n       remedial language in section 216.15(9)(a)(9) prospectively,\n       may the same plaintiff also recover damages for prevailing on\n       a wage discrimination claim under section 216.6, and if so,\n       what types of damages may that plaintiff recover and for\n       what period of time?\n\n       For the reasons discussed herein, we answer the questions as\n\nfollows:\n\n             1. No.\n\n             2. Yes. Recoverable damages for loss of income are\n       based on discriminatory wage payments that occurred within\n       300 days before the plaintiff filed a complaint with the civil\n       rights commission.\n\n       I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n       Plaintiff Erin Dindinger worked for the defendant company,\n\nAllsteel, Inc., from December 1999 through May 20, 2011. Plaintiff Lisa\n\nLoring has worked at Allsteel since 2005. Defendant Scott Mills was the\n\nvice president of operations at Allsteel and the supervisor of Dindinger’s\n\ndirect supervisor during this period.    The plaintiffs allege that during\n\ntheir time with the company, Allsteel paid them less than male\n\nemployees performing similar work.\n\f                                       3\n\n      Dindinger, Loring, and a third plaintiff (Elizabeth Freund) brought\n\nsuit against Allsteel in the United States District Court for the Southern\n\nDistrict of Iowa on October 10, 2011, alleging Allsteel had violated the\n\nFederal Equal Pay Act of 1963.         See 29 U.S.C. § 206(d) (2006).         On\n\nFebruary 28, 2012, plaintiffs amended their complaint to include claims\n\nby Dindinger and Loring that Allsteel had violated Iowa Code section\n\n216.6A, which was enacted in 2009 and expressly prohibits wage\n\ndiscrimination. See 2009 Iowa Acts ch. 96, § 2 (codified at Iowa Code\n\n§ 216.6A (2011)).         The amended complaint also included claims by\n\nDindinger and Loring that Allsteel had violated Federal Title VII and\n\nviolated the ICRA as it stood before 2009.           The amended complaint\n\nfurther recited that Dindinger and Loring had filed employment\n\ndiscrimination complaints with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission (ICRC)\n\non October 12, 2011, as required by Iowa Code section 216.16. See Iowa\n\nCode § 216.16(1). According to the complaint, the ICRC issued right-to-\n\nsue notices to Dindinger and Loring on December 29.                     See id.\n\n§ 216.16(2)(b), (3)(a).\n\n      On January 4, 2013, the defendants moved for partial summary\n\njudgment.     Among other things, the defendants urged the court to\n\ndismiss Loring and Dindinger’s claims under Iowa Code section 216.6A\n\nto the extent they arose before the effective date of that provision (July 1,\n\n2009). Dindinger and Loring countered that section 216.6A should apply\n\nretroactively and should permit them to recover lost wages for the entire\n\nperiod they were discriminatorily paid.\n\n      The court heard oral arguments on March 26, 2013. The district\n\ncourt’s   subsequent       September   3   certification   order   provides   the\n\nbackground to the present appeal:\n\f                                     4\n      At oral argument, the Court asked both sides whether\n      certifying questions of Iowa law to the Iowa Supreme Court\n      would be helpful. Both sides responded that their respective\n      positions were clearly correct and that certification was not\n      necessary. Defendants reevaluated their position, and filed a\n      Motion to Certify arguing that certification would aid in\n      untangling the issue of whether Section 216.6A and its\n      complementary subsection, Iowa Code § 216.15(9)(a)(9),\n      apply retroactively to plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs filed a\n      resistance, defendants filed a reply, and the Court issued its\n      Ruling Granting Defendants’ Motion to Certify. The Court\n      also, on its own motion, notified the parties that it may\n      certify the additional and alternative question of the\n      availability and length of time for Section 216.6 wage\n      discrimination damages . . . .\n\n(Footnote omitted.) (Citation omitted.)\n\n      After permitting the parties to submit briefs and proposed\n\nlanguage on the certification issues, the district court decided to certify\n\ntwo questions to this court to clarify Iowa law with respect to wage\n\ndiscrimination claims.\n\n      II. Standard of Review.\n\n      As we have said recently,\n\n             It is within our discretion to answer certified questions\n      from a United States district court. Iowa Code § 684A.1\n      (stating the court “may” answer a certified question). We\n      may answer a question certified to us when (1) a proper\n      court certified the question, (2) the question involves a\n      matter of Iowa law, (3) the question “may be determinative of\n      the cause . . . pending in the certifying court,” and (4) it\n      appears to the certifying court that there is no controlling\n      Iowa precedent.

Analysis.\n\n      A. First Certified Question: Is Iowa Code Section 216.6A\n\nProspective or Retroactive? In 2009, the general assembly adopted an\n\nact “providing that wage discrimination is an unfair employment practice\n\nunder the Iowa civil rights Act and providing an enhanced remedy.”\n\f                                       5\n\n2009 Iowa Acts ch. 96, preamble. Among other things, the amendment\n\nadded a new section to the ICRA, section 216.6A. See id. § 2.\n\n      Previously, the ICRA made it an unfair or discriminatory practice\n\nfor an employer “to refuse to hire, accept, register, classify, or refer for\n\nemployment, to discharge any employee, or to otherwise discriminate in\n\nemployment . . . because of the age, race, creed, color, sex, sexual\n\norientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, or disability” of the\n\nemployee or job applicant. Iowa Code § 216.6(1)(a). The new section,\n\nsection 216.6A, provides as follows:\n\n          216.6A Additional unfair or discriminatory practice\n      — wage discrimination in employment.\n\n            1. a. The general assembly finds that the practice of\n      discriminating against any employee because of the age,\n      race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity,\n      national origin, religion, or disability of such employee by\n      paying wages to such employee at a rate less than the rate\n      paid to other employees does all of the following:\n\n             (1) Unjustly discriminates against the person receiving\n      the lesser rate.\n\n            (2) Leads to low employee morale, high turnover, and\n      frequent labor unrest.\n\n            (3) Discourages employees paid at lesser wage rates\n      from training for higher level jobs.\n\n           (4) Curtails employment opportunities,            decreases\n      employees’ mobility, and increases labor costs.\n\n           (5) Impairs purchasing power and threatens the\n      maintenance of an adequate standard of living by such\n      employees and their families.\n\n            (6) Prevents optimum utilization of the state’s available\n      labor resources.\n\n           (7) Threatens the well-being of citizens of this state\n      and adversely affects the general welfare.\n\n            b. The general assembly declares that it is the policy\n      of this state to correct and, as rapidly as possible, to\n      eliminate, discriminatory wage practices based on age, race,\n\f                                     6\n      creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national\n      origin, religion, and disability.\n\n             2. a. It shall be an unfair or discriminatory practice\n      for any employer or agent of any employer to discriminate\n      against any employee because of the age, race, creed, color,\n      sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin,\n      religion, or disability of such employee by paying wages to\n      such employee at a rate less than the rate paid to other\n      employees who are employed within the same establishment\n      for equal work on jobs, the performance of which requires\n      equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are\n      performed under similar working conditions. An employer or\n      agent of an employer who is paying wages to an employee at\n      a rate less than the rate paid to other employees in violation\n      of this section shall not remedy the violation by reducing the\n      wage rate of any employee.\n\n             b. For purposes of this subsection, an unfair or\n      discriminatory practice occurs when a discriminatory pay\n      decision or other practice is adopted, when an individual\n      becomes subject to a discriminatory pay decision or other\n      practice, or when an individual is affected by application of a\n      discriminatory pay decision or other practice, including each\n      time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid,\n      resulting in whole or in part from such a decision or other\n      practice.\n\nIowa Code § 216.6A(1)–(2).     The section goes on to delineate certain\n\naffirmative defenses for the employer:\n\n           3. It shall be an affirmative defense to a claim arising\n      under this section if any of the following applies:\n\n            a. Payment of wages is made pursuant to a seniority\n      system.\n\n            b. Payment of wages is made pursuant to a merit\n      system.\n\n           c. Payment of wages is made pursuant to a system\n      which measures earnings by quantity or quality of\n      production.\n\n           d. Pay differential is based on any other factor other\n      than the age, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation,\n      gender identity, national origin, religion, or disability of such\n      employee.\n\nId. § 216.6A(3).\n\f                                             7\n\n       The legislature simultaneously enacted a separate, enhanced\n\nremedy for violations of section 216.6A.               2009 Iowa Acts ch. 96, § 3\n\n(codified at Iowa Code § 216.15(9)(a)(9)). Specifically:\n\n             (9) For an unfair or discriminatory practice relating to\n       wage discrimination pursuant to section 216.6A, payment to\n       the complainant of damages for an injury caused by the\n       discriminatory or unfair practice which damages shall\n       include but are not limited to court costs, reasonable\n       attorney fees, and either of the following:\n\n             (a) An amount equal to two times the wage differential\n       paid to another employee compared to the complainant for\n       the period of time for which the complainant has been\n       discriminated against.\n\n             (b) In instances of willful violation, an amount equal to\n       three times the wage differential paid to another employee as\n       compared to the complainant for the period of time for which\n       the complainant has been discriminated against.\n\nIowa Code § 216.15(9)(a)(9).           In contrast, plaintiffs prevailing on any\n\nother ICRA claim are entitled to recover court costs, reasonable attorney\n\nfees, and “actual damages.” Id. § 216.15(9)(a)(8).\n\n       The first certified question requires us to determine whether\n\nsection 216.6A and the enhanced remedy in section 216.15(9)(a)(9)\n\nshould apply retroactively to claims arising before the statute’s July 1,\n2009 effective date. 1 “Legislative intent determines if a court will apply a\n\n\n\n       1The   certified question assumes these ICRA amendments became effective April\n28, 2009, i.e., the date the governor approved them. See 2009 Iowa Acts ch. 96\n(“Approved April 28, 2009.”). However, legislation passed at a regular session does not\ngo into effect until July 1 of the session year unless the legislature expressly provides\nfor a different date, and it did not do so here. See Iowa Const. art. III, § 26 (“An act of\nthe general assembly passed at a regular session of a general assembly shall take effect\non July 1 following its passage unless a different effective date is stated in an act of the\ngeneral assembly.”).\n        Another federal district court in Iowa has ruled that Iowa Code section 216.6A\napplies prospectively only.

The court there concluded that “the statute created, defined, and regulated a\n\f                                        8\n\nstatute retrospectively or prospectively.” Iowa Beta Chapter of Phi Delta\n\nTheta Fraternity v.

There is a\n\ngeneral    presumption      that    newly    enacted     statutes    apply    only\n\nprospectively.    See Iowa Code § 4.5 (“A statute is presumed to be\n\nprospective in its operation unless expressly made retrospective.”);\n\nFrideres v. Schiltz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1911139\"><a href=\"/opinion/1911139/frideres-v-schiltz/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264 (Iowa 1995) (discussing the\n\nlegislative preference for prospectivity).         We have summarized the\n\nrelevant principles in the past:\n\n            It is well established that a statute is presumed to be\n      prospective only unless expressly made retrospective.\n      Statutes which specifically affect substantive rights are\n      construed to operate prospectively unless legislative intent to\n      the contrary clearly appears from the express language or by\n      necessary and unavoidable implication. Conversely, if the\n      statute relates solely to a remedy or procedure, it is\n      ordinarily applied both prospectively and retrospectively.\n\n             . . . Substantive law creates, defines and regulates\n      rights. Procedural law, on the other hand, is the practice,\n      method, procedure, or legal machinery by which the\n      substantive law is enforced or made effective. Finally, a\n      remedial statute is one that intends to afford a private\n      remedy to a person injured by a wrongful act. It is generally\n      designed to correct an existing law or redress an existing\n      grievance.\n\nAnderson Fin. Servs., LLC v. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2099617\"><a href=\"/opinion/2099617/anderson-financial-services-llc-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578 (Iowa 2009)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The first step in determining whether a statute has retroactive\n\neffect is to assess whether the legislature expressly stated its intent that\n\na statute should apply retrospectively. Id. Here, the legislature did not\n\ninclude express language in section 216.6A to make it retroactive.\n\n\n\n___________________________________\nnew right.” Forster, 925 F. Supp. 2d at 1066; Lenius, 924 F. Supp. 2d at 1015. That\nruling, of course, is not binding on us.\n\f                                         9\n\n      The next step is to ascertain whether “the statute affects\n\nsubstantive rights or relates merely to a remedy.” Id. at 579. If the law\n\n“is substantive, we presume it operates prospectively only.” Id. If the\n\nstatute is remedial, we presume it operates retrospectively. Id. A statute\n\nis not remedial merely because one might say, colloquially, that its\n\npurpose is to “remedy” a defect in the law. See id. at 580. “[I]f a mere\n\nlegislative purpose to remedy a perceived defect in the law made a statute\n\nremedial, very few statutes would not fall within this classification.” Id.\n\nat 580 n.4. Thus, in Anderson Financial, our most recent foray into this\n\nsubject, we held that a cap on certain finance charges was not “remedial”\n\nbut   “substantive,”    because   it    effected   a   substantive   change   in\n\npermissible conduct.

They argue the section is merely procedural because it\n\nshifts the burden of proof from the employee to the employer.             They\n\nfurther contend section 216.6A is merely remedial because it provides an\n\nenhanced remedy—double or treble damages—for a preexisting cause of\n\naction of wage discrimination.\n\n       After careful consideration, we disagree with Dindinger and Loring.\n\nUnder preexisting law, unlawful discrimination occurred only when a\n\nperson was subjected to adverse treatment “because of” her membership\n\nin a protected class.

Note the distinct\n\nwording of section 216.6A.        It makes it illegal “to discriminate against\n\nany employee . . . by paying wages to such employee at a rate less than\n\nthe rate paid to other employees.”            Iowa Code § 216.6A(2)(a).       Thus,\n\nrather than requiring discrimination based on protected status to be\n\nindependently proved, section 216.6A defines discrimination as the act of\n\npaying lower wages. As the amicus curiae supporting the plaintiffs puts\n\nit,\n\n       [T]he Iowa Legislature enacted § 216.6A to ensure that all\n       forms of discrimination would be exposed and addressed—\n       even those that were falling through the cracks under\n       traditional discrimination analysis.\n\n              ....\n\n             Section 216.6A addresses this issue by including\n       additional remedies and making the claim intent-neutral.\n       Under § 216.6A, it does not matter why the wages are\n       discriminatorily less; it matters only that they are less.\n\n       Section 216.6A of the Iowa Code therefore creates an entirely new\n\ncause of action: strict liability on the part of employers for paying\n\nunequal wages.         Its wording is similar to the Federal Equal Pay Act.\n\nCompare id., with 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1) (2012) (providing that no\n\nemployer subject to the Act “shall discriminate . . . between employees on\n\n\n       2Of    course, prior law also recognized “disparate impact” claims.

See Iowa Code § 216.6A(3)(d).     But this\n\ndoes not alter the fact that the legislation establishes a new cause of\n\naction with fewer elements than before. And it is not open to dispute\n\nthat there are some cases where the employee will be able to prevail now\n\nand would not have been able to prevail before. In that middle group,\n\nsection 216.6A imposes liability that did not previously exist.\n\n      In some ways, section 216.6A presents a clearer case for\n\nprospective-only operation than a law that made it easier to obtain\n\npersonal jurisdiction by personal service, see Davis, 247 Iowa at 1033–\n\n36, 78 N.W.2d at 7–9, or a law that imposed personal in addition to in\n\nrem liability for nonpayment of property taxes, see Hiskey, 580 N.W.2d\n\nat 798–99.

We find them distinguishable. The statute involved in Bainbridge\nwas “not a substantive statute.” 749 N.W.2d at 250–51. It simply had the effect of\nshortening the time for a tax sale buyer to exercise its option to give notice of the right\nof redemption. Id. The statute in Tank Fund, according to the legislative findings,\nestablished a clean-up fund for “past and existing petroleum leaks.” 606 N.W.2d at 375\n(emphasis omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). This “clearly revealed an intent\nfor the act to apply retroactively.” Id. at 376. The statute in Emmet County required\nstate banks that purchased land at a foreclosure sale to offer it to the prior owner on\nthe same terms before consummating any resale. 439 N.W.2d at 653. We noted that\nthe law referred to resales of “agricultural land held pursuant to this subsection” and\nthus “appl[ied] to agricultural land owned by a state bank on the effective date of the\namendment, regardless of when the land was acquired.” Id. at 654 (emphasis omitted)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n        In a sense, the laws in Bainbridge and Emmet County were not retroactive at all\nbecause they only set standards for conduct occurring after their enactment—i.e., a city\ncould seek title to abandoned land, Bainbridge, 749 N.W.2d at 250–51, and a state\nbank had to offer foreclosed property on the same terms to the prior owner before\nselling it to a new owner, Emmet Cnty., 439 N.W.2d at 653. Here, by contrast,\nDindinger and Loring seek to have the substantive law set forth in Iowa Code section\n216.6A applied to conduct that predated the enactment of the statute, i.e., things their\nemployer did or did not do before the law was adopted in 2009.

The FPA did not amend the underlying substantive\nlaw; it merely changed the statute of limitations. See Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act § 3\n(codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–5(e)). Further, the FPA is expressly retroactive; Congress\nprovided that it would take effect “as if enacted on May 28, 2007” and that it “appl[ied]\nto all claims of discrimination in compensation . . . that are pending on or after that\ndate.” Id. § 6 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–5).\n\f                                          15\n\nassembly’s own statement that it was legislating an “[a]dditional unfair or\n\ndiscriminatory practice,” Iowa Code § 216.6A, we conclude that section\n\n216.6A applies on a prospective basis only to conduct occurring after its\n\neffective date of July 1, 2009.\n\n       B. Second Certified Question: To What Extent May a Plaintiff\n\nRecover Damages for Wage Discrimination Under Iowa Code Section\n\n216.6?        Because we have concluded that Iowa Code section 216.6A\n\noperates prospectively and not retroactively, we now turn to the district\n\ncourt’s second certified question. This concerns the ability of plaintiffs to\n\nrecover damages for wage discrimination under the preexisting law,\n\nnamely, section 216.6. 5\n\n       Section 216.6 states in relevant part,\n\n       It shall be an unfair or discriminatory practice for any:\n\n              a. Person to refuse to hire, accept, register, classify, or\n       refer for employment, to discharge any employee, or to\n       otherwise discriminate in employment against any applicant\n       for employment or any employee because of the age, race,\n       creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national\n       origin, religion, or disability of such applicant or\n       employee . . . .\n\nIowa Code § 216.6(1)(a).            Prevailing plaintiffs can recover “actual\n\ndamages, court costs and reasonable attorney fees.”                       Iowa Code\n\n§ 216.15(9)(a)(8).\n\n\n\n       5The   defendants urge that the plaintiffs have not pled and thus have not\npreserved a wage discrimination claim under Iowa Code section 216.6 in federal court.\nHowever, resolving that question of federal court claim preservation is not our\nresponsibility.\n       As noted above, we do have discretion not to answer a certified question. See\nIowa Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Tooker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427 (Iowa 2011). Here, we do\nnot have “a situation where the answers to the questions are fact-dependent or the facts\nare in conflict.” Id. Accordingly, we will answer the second question and leave any\nquestion of claim preservation to the federal district court to resolve.\n\f                                      16\n\n      Claims under section 216.6 are also subject to a limitations period:\n\n“[A] claim under this chapter shall not be maintained unless a complaint\n\nis filed with the [Iowa Civil Rights C]ommission within three hundred\n\ndays after the alleged discriminatory or unfair practice occurred.” Iowa\n\nCode § 216.15(13).       This provision mirrors similar language in federal\n\nlaw. Compare id., with 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–5(e)(1) (requiring a charge to\n\nbe filed “within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful\n\nemployment practice occurred” or “within three hundred days after the\n\nalleged unlawful employment practice occurred,” depending on the\n\nsituation).\n\n      We have no difficulty concluding that wage discrimination is\n\npotentially actionable under Iowa Code section 216.6.             The section\n\nprohibits an employer from “otherwise discriminat[ing] in employment.”\n\nIowa Code § 216.6(1)(a).        This catchall provision demonstrates the\n\nlegislature’s intent to prohibit all discriminatory practices relating to\n\nemployment       under    section   216.6,   even   those   not    specifically\n\nenumerated.      Payment of wages is a mainstay of any employment\n\nrelationship, and section 216.6 therefore encompasses discriminatory\n\npay practices.\n\n      For example, in a 1996 case before our court, a female plaintiff\n\nbrought a claim for loss of income, emotional distress, punitive damages,\n\nand attorney fees based on the allegation her employer paid her less than\n\nit paid men.     Dutcher v. Randall Foods, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2067156\"><a href=\"/opinion/2067156/dutcher-v-randall-foods/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 891 (Iowa\n\n1996).    The employer did not cross-appeal, so “we accept[ed] as\n\nestablished that Randall violated the . . .

For reasons explained\n\nbelow, we adopt neither position, and instead conclude each paycheck is\n\na discriminatory practice and a new 300-day limitations period applies to\n\neach check.

While the\n\nplaintiff established a prima facie case of employment discrimination\n\nbased on national origin, the record also showed that the employer\n\f                                       18\n\nsexually segregated its work force, reserving stocker positions (that were\n\nneeded for promotion) to men. Id. at 521–24.\n\n      We      rejected   the   employer’s   argument   that   the   employee’s\n\ncomplaint was untimely because the discriminatory conduct began\n\noutside the limitations period in Iowa Code section 601A.15 (1983), even\n\nthough it continued into that period. Id. at 527–30. We elaborated on\n\nthe elements of a continuing violation by analogizing to federal cases\n\ndecided under the ICRA’s federal counterpart, Title VII. See id. at 528–\n\n29. We stated,\n\n      [T]he “continuing violation” doctrine does not excuse\n      compliance with the time limits for filing a charge. But if a\n      violation is continuing, the time does not begin to run when\n      the discrimination first happens. Instead the action is\n      considered filed in time if there are discriminatory acts\n      within the limitations period.\n\nId. at 527.\n\n      Relying primarily on decisions of federal courts of appeals, we went\n\non to describe two types of continuing violations, “a series of acts with\n\none independent discriminatory act occurring within the charge-filing\n\nperiod” and the “maintenance of a system or policy which discriminates.”\n\nId. at 528 (internal quotation marks omitted). We explained that the first\n\n“series of acts” type of continuing violation is discerned by a multifactor\n\napproach that considers whether the conduct is recurring and frequent,\n\nyet seemingly nonpermanent. See id. at 528–29. We upheld the ICRC’s\n\nfindings that the employer’s national origin discrimination was a\n\ncontinuing violation under the first theory, and its sex discrimination\n\nwas a continuing violation under the second theory. Id. at 528–30.\n\n      Without further discussing the continuing violation doctrine, we\n\nthen upheld the ICRC’s decision to award back pay to the employee for\n\f                                           19\n\nthe entire time period when the employer failed to promote her or give her\n\nfull-time status.

See 2 Emp’t Discrimination Coordinator:\nAnalysis of Fed. Law § 73:22 (2014), available at www.westlaw.com (“Although prior to\n\f                                         20\n\nindependently actionable act of discrimination cannot be combined with\n\nother independently actionable acts (even of the same type) to create a\n\ncontinuing violation.\n\n       While the Morgan Court unanimously found that the continuing\n\nviolation rule did not apply to discrete acts of discrimination, a majority\n\nof the Court would allow it to apply to hostile work environment claims,\n\nnoting that such claims were “different in kind from discrete acts.” Id. at\n\n113–15, 122 S. Ct. at 2072–73, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 122–23.                  The Court\n\nexplained that a hostile work environment claim “cannot be said to occur\n\non any particular day,” but “occurs over a series of days or perhaps\n\nyears” and is “based on the cumulative effect of individual acts.” Id. at\n\n115, 122 S.

It\n\nreasoned   that    although   Morgan had    limited   applicability   of   the\n\ncontinuing violation theory under federal employment discrimination\n\nlaw, Iowa had followed a separate course. Id. The Eighth Circuit said,\n\n      In [Hy-Vee Food Stores, 453 N.W.2d at 530–31,] the Iowa\n      Supreme Court adopted the continuing violation doctrine,\n      permitting recovery for the entire period an employee’s rights\n      have been violated if at least one act of illegal discrimination\n      occurred within the [required] period before a complaint was\n      filed . . . .\n\nId. at 1054.\n\n      Dindinger and Loring rely heavily on Hy-Vee Food Stores and\n\nMadison.       However, six months after Madison, we reexamined and\n\nclarified the scope of the continuing violation doctrine under the ICRA.\n\nSee Farmland Foods, 672 N.W.2d at 740–41. Farmland Foods involved\n\nclaims by an African-American employee of a meat packing plant that he\n\nhad been repeatedly discriminated against over a fifteen-year period. Id.\n\nat 737–40.      Among other things, the employee alleged Farmland had\n\ndiscriminated against him with respect to work assignments, work\n\nhours, and discipline.    Id. at 738–39.    “[M]ost of the evidence . . .\n\nconcerned events that predated” the applicable statute of limitations. Id.\n\nat 741.\n\n      We made clear that notwithstanding Hy-Vee Food Stores, the\n\ncontinuing violation doctrine “applies differently to claims of discrete\n\ndiscriminatory acts than to claims of hostile work environment.”\n\nFarmland Foods, 672 N.W.2d at 741 (citing Morgan, 536 U.S. at 110–21,\n\n122 S. Ct. at 2070–76, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 120–27); see also Hy-Vee Food\n\nStores, 453 N.W.2d at 527–29. Following the Supreme Court’s lead in\n\nMorgan, we said that “[e]ach discrete discriminatory act or event is\n\nseparately actionable, and a claim based on discrimination must be filed\n\f                                     22\n\nwithin the relevant limitation period.” Farmland Foods, 672 N.W.2d at\n\n741. “This is true,” we added, “even when the discrete discriminatory act\n\nrelates to other acts alleged in a timely filed complaint.” Id.\n\n      On this basis, we rejected the employee’s racial discrimination\n\nclaims as time-barred.    Id. at 743.     We considered each act of alleged\n\ndiscrimination on its own and noted that while some complained-of\n\nincidents had occurred within the limitations period, none of those\n\nmatters amounted to a materially adverse employment action.           Id. at\n\n742–43. Separately, we acknowledged that the employee’s hostile work\n\nenvironment claim could proceed on a continuing violation theory,\n\nbecause such claims “involve repeated conduct and are based on the\n\ncumulative impact of separate acts.” Id. at 741 (citing Morgan, 536 U.S.\n\nat 115, 122 S. Ct. at 2073, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 123). But, we found no\n\nsubstantial evidence to support that claim, even when considering the\n\ntotality of the employer’s conduct for the duration of the employee’s\n\nemployment. Id. at 743–46.\n\n      Thus, in Farmland Foods, we adopted the “discrete acts” approach\n\nthat had won the Supreme Court’s unanimous approval in Morgan. Id.\n\nat 741; see also Morgan, 536 U.S. at 110–21, 122 S. Ct. at 2070–76, 153\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 120–27.        If an employer commits a discrete act of\n\ndiscrimination that can be the basis for a civil rights action, the statute\n\nof limitations begins to run on that act, even if the act is repeated and in\n\nthat sense continues.\n\n      Four years after Farmland Foods, the United States Supreme Court\n\nrendered its controversial Ledbetter decision.     See Ledbetter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145727\"><a href=\"/opinion/145727/ledbetter-v-goodyear-tire-rubber-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145727\"><a href=\"/opinion/145727/ledbetter-v-goodyear-tire-rubber-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

By a five-to-four margin, the Court held the\n\ndiscriminatory act that triggered the Title VII limitations period was the\n\npay-setting decision, not the issuance of the discriminatory paycheck,\n\nand a plaintiff who did not file within the required period after the pay-\n\nsetting decision could not recover at all.

Evans,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1947134\"><a href=\"/opinion/1947134/state-ex-rel-claypool-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">757</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 2008).        Claypool was a housing discrimination\n\ncase. A condominium owner maintained that a developer had engaged in\n\ndisability discrimination by selling a condominium that was not\n\naccessible to him in light of his progressive joint degeneration and\n\ndifficulty with walking. Id. at 167–68. Although the complainant bought\n\nthe condominium in 1999, he did not file a complaint with the ICRC until\n\n2002.     Id. at 167.    To try to surmount the developer’s statute of\n\nlimitations defense, the ICRC and the complainant relied on the\n\ncontinuing violation theory. Id. at 171.\n\f                                    24\n\n      We rejected that theory, noting that “the specific discriminatory\n\npractice was the sale of a housing unit designed and constructed to be\n\ninaccessible to a person with disabilities.” Id. at 172. We added, “This\n\ndiscriminatory practice was complete upon the sale.”         Id.   We also\n\ndiscussed the Ledbetter decision, commenting that it “focused on the\n\nissue of continuing violation versus continuing effect.”    Id. at 171–72\n\n(citing Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at 624–28, 127 S. Ct. at 2167–69, 167\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 990–93 (Alito, J., majority opinion)). We observed that the\n\nhousing case before us involved “a continuing effect of the discriminatory\n\npractice rather than a continuing violation.” Id. at 172. Still, we did not\n\nadopt the specific holding of Ledbetter, and Dindinger and Loring\n\ncorrectly point out that Claypool is distinguishable on its facts from a\n\nwage discrimination case because there clearly could not have been a\n\ndiscriminatory practice committed by the developer after it sold the\n\ncondominium in 1999. See id. at 167.\n\n      The next year, approximately three months before our general\n\nassembly amended the ICRA to add section 216.6A, Congress overturned\n\nLedbetter by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (FPA). The\n\nFPA provides that “an unlawful employment practice occurs . . . when an\n\nindividual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation decision or\n\nother practice, . . . including each time wages, benefits, or other\n\ncompensation is paid.” Id. at § 3 (codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000e–5(e)), The\n\nFPA also allows the victim of discrimination to recover back pay for up to\n\ntwo years preceding the filing of the charge. Id.\n\n      From the foregoing narrative, we can distill three lessons. First, in\n\nFarmland Foods, we aligned ourselves with the unanimous view of the\n\nSupreme Court in Morgan that the continuing violation doctrine does not\n\napply to cases involving discrete discriminatory acts, as opposed to\n\f                                    25\n\nhostile work environment claims. See Farmland Foods, 672 N.W.2d at\n\n741; see also Morgan, 536 U.S. at 114–18, 122 S. Ct. at 2073–75, 153\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 122–25.      Discrete discriminatory acts are “separately\n\nactionable,” not a basis for invoking the continuing violation theory. Id.\n\nSecond, if there is no discriminatory act but only an effect of a past\n\ndiscriminatory act within the limitations period, then the claim is time-\n\nbarred. See Claypool, 757 N.W.2d at 171–72. Third, conduct that is not\n\nseparately actionable but may become actionable based upon its\n\n“cumulative impact” may be pursued on a continuing violation theory if\n\nsome of the conduct occurred within the limitations period.            See\n\nFarmland Foods, 672 N.W.2d at 741.\n\n      All of these principles are consistent with the language of the ICRA,\n\nwhich requires the complaint to be filed with the ICRC “within three\n\nhundred days after the alleged discriminatory or unfair practice\n\noccurred.” Iowa Code § 216.15(13) (2011). Under this wording, which is\n\nsimilar to the federal wording, the relevant unit of analysis is the\n\n“discriminatory or unfair practice.” Compare id., with Lilly Ledbetter Fair\n\nPay Act § 3 (codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000e–5(e)).         If more than one\n\ndiscriminatory act has occurred, even if the same type of act is being\n\nrepeated, the timeliness of each act should be evaluated individually. If\n\nonly one act has occurred, it is sufficient if some of the relevant conduct\n\noccurred within the limitations period.\n\n      The question then is how to classify the act of paying a female\n\nemployee less than her male counterpart where the discriminatory\n\nreasons for the wage discrepancy originated somewhere in the past. Is\n\nthe too-low paycheck (1) a discrete act of discrimination, (2) merely an\n\neffect of prior discrimination, or (3) conduct that, to be actionable, must\n\nbe weighed in its overall impact with other conduct?\n\f                                           26\n\n       We think the paycheck falls in the first category.                    Paying an\n\nemployee in a protected class less than other employees, if done with\n\ndiscriminatory intent, is always separately actionable. It does not matter\n\nhow many times the conduct occurred, and one does not need to\n\nconsider other conduct to determine whether the employer has violated\n\nthe law.     Thus, under Farmland Foods, the limitations analysis goes\n\npaycheck by paycheck.            672 N.W.2d at 741.            A discriminatory pay\n\npractice does not become more discriminatory each time a new check is\n\npaid, unlike a series of harassing incidents that may only amount to a\n\nhostile work environment when accumulated.                  A paycheck is precisely\n\nthe type of discrete practice that we envisioned in Farmland Foods when\n\nwe distinguished discrete acts from violations based on cumulative\n\nconduct. Id. 7\n\n       On the other hand, we do not agree with the Ledbetter majority (or\n\nthe defendants here) that an employer’s issuance of a smaller paycheck\n\nto a protected class employee is merely an “effect” of a prior pay-setting\n\ndecision, as opposed to an independent discriminatory act.

This language appears to allow the\nemployee to recover for the entire period of discrimination, so long as some equal pay\nviolation occurred within 300 days of the employee’s administrative complaint. But the\nfact that the legislature inserted this language for section 216.6A claims suggests that it\ndid not believe the existing language in section 216.15 had that effect.\n\f                                          27\n\nhave committed discriminatory acts with respect to that condominium.\n\nSee 757 N.W.2d at 172. The law frequently, as in the case of the ICRA,\n\nrequires a combination of an act and intent to impose liability. Yet, the\n\ntwo do not have to arise at the same time so long as they are connected.\n\nFor example, would an employer that hired a new female employee be\n\nable to escape liability simply because it based her low compensation on\n\na discriminatory pay scale it had adopted ten years before? Clearly not. 8\n\n       A pay-setting decision alone is not actionable unless accompanied\n\nby unequal payments. Accordingly, it seems unfair to tie the statute of\n\nlimitations to an event that, by itself, would be insufficient to trigger\n\nliability. At the same time, an employer may reasonably be held liable for\n\nfailing to pay an employee properly at any time within the limitations\n\nperiod, since the employer always has the ability to reexamine and\n\ncorrect an improper pay-setting decision.\n\n       Other state courts, applying their own states’ civil rights laws, have\n\ndetermined      that   disparate     paychecks      are    discrete   discriminatory\n\npractices.     For example, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts\n\ndeclined to apply the continuing violation theory to unequal pay claims\n\nunder its state equal rights law. See Silvestris v.

The court ultimately\n\nfound no violation of the Massachusetts equal rights law, but in doing so,\n\nit determined the continuing violation theory should not apply to\n\nunequal compensation claims under state law. See id. at 338, 343. The\n\ncourt decided each paycheck should be treated as a discrete act because\n\n“[a]n alleged inequality can be identified on examination of individual\n\npaychecks, rather than on the evaluation of ongoing wrongful conduct.”\n\nId. at 338.   It noted that applying the continuing violation doctrine\n\n“would eviscerate the one-year statute of limitations set forth in” the\n\nstatute. Id. at 338–39. It therefore concluded that pay claims give rise to\n\na cause of action subject to its own statute of limitations period each\n\ntime a paycheck is issued. See id. at 339.\n\n      The New Jersey Supreme Court similarly concluded that under its\n\nstate wage discrimination law, each payment of unequal wages was an\n\nactionable wrong subject to a two-year statute of limitations.

The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed. Id. at\n\n199–200.

Instead, it adopted the same\n\nanalysis we follow today, noting it had previously approved the rationale\n\nof Morgan, which distinguished between discrete acts of discrimination\n\nand hostile work environment claims.

The court\n\nconcluded,\n\n      Each payment of such discriminatory wages thus constitutes\n      a renewed separable and actionable wrong that is remediable\n      under the [wage discrimination law].

The court referenced a previous case in which it\n\nheld the limitations period for employment discrimination “commences\n\n‘when     the   employee   is   informed   of   the   allegedly   discriminatory\n\nemployment decision, not when that decision comes to fruition.’ ” Id. at\n\n505 (quoting Specialty Retailers v.

Based on the logic of this prior case, the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt concluded this “rule applies with equal force in the context of pay\n\ndiscrimination decisions.”      Id. at 509.     It held only the pay-setting\n\ndecision was a discrete act and “[s]ubsequent paychecks . . . are merely\n\nconsequences of past discrimination.” Id. at 510.\n\n        In contrast to the Texas approach, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals\n\nrecently applied the continuing violation principle to wage discrimination\n\nclaims.    Rice Lake Harley Davidson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 893–94\n\n(Wis. Ct. App. 2014).      The court noted that Wisconsin had chosen to\n\napply the continuing violation theory to unequal pay claims nearly\n\ntwenty years earlier, before Morgan was decided. See id. at 893 (citing\n\nAbbyland Processing v.

The\n\ncourt declined to follow intervening federal interpretations of wage\n\f                                   31\n\ndiscrimination cases and instead adhered to prior authority of the\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court. See id. at 894–95.\n\n       Because of specific Ohio statutory language, the Ohio Supreme\n\nCourt has applied the continuing violation doctrine to its state wage\n\ndiscrimination law. See Featzka v. Millcraft Paper Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n266–67 (Ohio 1980). Ohio law provides for recovery “ ‘from the date of\n\nthe commencement of the violation.’ ” Id. at 266 (quoting Ohio Rev. Code\n\nAnn. § 4111.17(D)). The court relied on this language to conclude, “the\n\nlegislature clearly indicated its intent to permit recovery from the\n\nbeginning of the prohibited discrimination until its termination.” Id. at\n\n267.   Similarly, in a certified question from the Eastern District of\n\nTennessee, the Supreme Court of Tennessee determined that wage\n\ndiscrimination claims under Tennessee law were continuing violations.\n\nBooker v. Boeing Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1058029\"><a href=\"/opinion/1058029/booker-v-the-boeing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 641 (Tenn. 2006). It reached this\n\nconclusion based on the language of the state human rights act, which\n\nallowed recovery if a claim was filed within one year “ ‘after the alleged\n\ndiscriminatory practice ceases.’ ” Id. at 642 (quoting Tenn. Code. Ann.\n\n§ 4–21–311(d) (2005)).   The court contrasted this wording with that of\n\nTitle VII, which allowed recovery within a set period “ ‘after the alleged\n\nunlawful employment practice occurred.’ ” Id. at 648 (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n\n2000e–5(e)(1)). The court reasoned a discriminatory pay rate “does not\n\ncease each time an employee receives a paycheck” but only “when the\n\nemployer brings the employee into parity with his or her peers.” Id. at\n\n648.   Therefore, the court determined the legislature had intended to\n\nincorporate   the   continuing   violation   doctrine   into   the   wage\n\ndiscrimination statute by using the word “ceases.” See id.\n\n       Except for the new cause of action added in 2009, the ICRA does\n\nnot have language as in Ohio or Tennessee that would allow the claimant\n\f                                           32\n\nto revert to the date when the employer initially discriminated against the\n\nemployee. And unlike Wisconsin, we have expressly adopted the discrete\n\nacts approach to the statute of limitations set forth in Morgan.                      See\n\nFarmland Foods, 672 N.W.2d at 741.                  We therefore believe that the\n\nDistrict of Columbia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York\n\nhave it right: Separate discriminatory paychecks should be evaluated\n\nseparately for limitations purposes. See Zuurbier, 895 A.2d at 910–14;\n\nBudzileni, 910 N.E.2d at 1200 (noting the chief legal counsel’s\n\ninstruction that “each alleged payment of unequal wages [is] a separate\n\nand discrete incident”); Silvestris, 847 N.E.2d at 338; Alexander, 8 A.3d\n\nat 207; Kent, 764 N.Y.S.2d at 679. 9\n\n       9Dindinger   and Loring also rely on a longstanding ICRC regulation, which\nprovides:\n               3.3(2) Continuing violation. If the alleged unlawful discriminatory\n       practice or act is of a continuing nature, the date of the occurrence of the\n       alleged unlawful practice shall be deemed to be any date subsequent to\n       the commencement of the alleged unlawful practice up to and including\n       the date upon which the unlawful practice has ceased.\nIowa Admin. Code r. 161—3.3(2). We agree with Allsteel and Mills that this regulation\nessentially restates the present question without answering it. The question remains:\nWere there multiple discriminatory acts or was there one act of a continuing nature?\nNotably, when we addressed the continuing violation theory in Claypool, we did not give\nany deference to the ICRC’s views or cite to this regulation. See 757 N.W.2d at 169,\n171–72 (reviewing for correction of errors at law).\n        In Renda v.

We emphasized that “each case requires a careful look at the\nspecific language the agency has interpreted as well as the specific duties and authority\ngiven to the agency with respect to enforcing particular statutes.” Renda, 784 N.W.2d\nat 13. We have given deference to agency interpretations of “a substantive term within\nthe special expertise of the agency,” but not a term with “an independent legal definition\nthat is not uniquely within the subject matter expertise of the agency.” Id. at 14.\nThere, we ultimately concluded the ICRC was not clearly vested with authority to\ninterpret the terms “employee” and “dwelling.” See id. at 14–15. Here, the question is\nreally one of interpreting the term “practice”—do we have one or more than one? Like\nthe definitions of employee and dwelling, this matter is not uniquely within the\nexpertise of the ICRC. Hence, we believe the ICRC’s regulation would not be entitled to\ndeference, even if it answered the question.\n\f                                           33\n\n       For all these reasons, we conclude an employee can assert a wage\n\ndiscrimination claim under Iowa Code section 216.6.
