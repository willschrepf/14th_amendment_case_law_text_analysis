Bilyeu appeals the district court’s dismissal of her\nclaim challenging the termination of her long-term disability\nbenefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act\nof 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. § 1132. Bilyeu also challenges\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of\nFirst Unum Life Insurance Company (Unum) on Unum’s\ncounterclaim for restitution of overpaid benefits. We have\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we vacate and\nremand.\n\n   We vacate the judgment in favor of Unum on Bilyeu’s\nclaim for denial of benefits. We hold that the district court\nabused its discretion by dismissing this claim for failure to\nexhaust administrative remedies. The exhaustion requirement\nshould have been excused because Bilyeu acted reasonably in\nlight of Unum’s ambiguous communications and failure to\nengage in a meaningful dialogue.\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                7249\n   We also vacate the judgment in favor of Unum on Unum’s\ncounterclaim for reimbursement of overpaid long-term dis-\nability benefits. Unum has not shown that it is seeking equita-\nble relief because it has not satisfied the elements for an\nequitable lien by agreement, which is the only form of equita-\nble relief Unum has asserted. These elements are not satisfied\nbecause the particular fund subject to the lien, having been\ndissipated, is no longer in Bilyeu’s possession. Unum thus\nseeks only the imposition of personal liability against Bilyeu,\nto be paid out of her general assets. That is quintessentially\nlegal, rather than equitable, relief.\n\n                    I.   BACKGROUND\n\n   Bilyeu was employed by Discover Financial Services from\n1987 through April 2004. Compl. ¶ 8. Morgan Stanley Long-\nTerm Disability Plan (the Plan) provides benefits for long-\nterm disabilities to Discover employees. Id. ¶¶ 4-5. Unum is\nthe Plan’s claim administrator, and also the insurer and payor\nof Plan benefits. Id. ¶¶ 6-7.\n\n   Alleging she suffered from several medical conditions that\nprevented her from materially performing the duties of any\noccupation, Bilyeu filed a long-term disability (LTD) claim\nwith Unum in April 2004. Id. ¶¶ 9-10. These conditions\nincluded Behçet’s disease, fatigue and anxiety. Id. ¶¶ 12-18;\nClerk’s Record 13-2 at 3. Unum approved the claim in Octo-\nber 2004. Compl. ¶ 11. Under the Plan, benefits for disabili-\nties arising from mental illness are limited to 24 months. Id.\n¶ 19. Unum concluded that Bilyeu’s disability was subject to\nthe mental illness limitation. Id. Bilyeu disputed that conclu-\nsion. Id. ¶¶ 12-20.\n\n  Nearing the 24-month deadline, Dr. Sharon Hogan, a medi-\ncal consultant for Unum, called Bilyeu’s treating physician,\nDr. Kenneth Proefrock, to discuss her medical condition.\nClerk’s Record 15.1 at 5-7. On December 6, 2006, Dr. Hogan\nsent a summary of the conversation to Dr. Proefrock, asking\n\f7250              BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nhim to respond within 10 business days if he believed the let-\nter inaccurately summarized their conversation. Id. at 6. The\nletter reflected disagreement between Dr. Hogan and Dr.\nProefrock regarding the nature of Bilyeu’s limitations. Dr.\nHogan believed “Bilyeu’s fatigue in large part arises from her\nanxiety and depression, since her Behçet’s is not very active.”\nId. at 6. It was Dr. Proefrock’s opinion, however, “that her\nfatigue is mainly physical.” Id. Dr. Hogan also believed that\nBilyeu “should have full-time sedentary work capacity,” an\nassessment with which Dr. Proefrock disagreed. Id. at 5;\nClerk’s Record 13-2 at 3.\n\n   On December 27, 2006, Unum sent Bilyeu a termination of\nbenefits letter. Clerk’s Record 13-2. Unum terminated bene-\nfits under the Plan provision limiting disability benefits due to\nmental illness to 24 months. Id. at 3. The letter reported that,\nalthough “fatigue can result from Behcet’s, . . . your anxiety\nand depression are the more likely causes of your fatigue.” Id.\nIt said, “because your claim is subject to a 24 month mental\n[illness] limitation and we have now provided 24 months of\nbenefits, we will stop paying benefits on your claim as of\nDecember 03, 2006 and your claim will be closed at this\ntime.” Id. at 4. The letter also recorded Unum’s conclusion\nthat “you have full time sedentary work capacity” and thus\n“no longer meet the definition of disability from a physical\nperspective.” Id. The letter noted Dr. Proefrock’s contrary\ndetermination that Bilyeu was unable to return to work. Id. at\n3.\n\n  The letter then advised Bilyeu:\n\n    If you have additional information to support your\n    request for disability benefits, it must be sent to my\n    attention for further review at the address noted on\n    this letterhead, within 180 days of the date you\n    receive this letter.\n\n    However, if you disagree with our determination and\n    want to appeal this claim decision, you must submit\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                  7251\n     a written appeal. This appeal must be received by us\n     within 180 days of the date you receive this letter.\n\nId. at 4. The “address noted on this letterhead” was:\n\n     First Unum Life Insurance Company\n     The Benefits Center\n     PO Box 100158\n     Columbia, SC 29202-3158\n     Phone: 1-800-858-8843\n     Fax: 1-800-447-2498\n     www.unumprovident.com\n\nId. at 1.\n\n   After receiving Unum’s termination of benefits letter,\nBilyeu asked Dr. Proefrock to respond to the letter. Compl. ¶\n22. Dr. Proefrock did so, writing a letter to Unum on April 19,\n2007. Id. ¶ 23. Dr. Proefrock’s letter was addressed “To\nWhom It May Concern” and, it appears, faxed to 1-800-447-\n2498 — the number listed in the letterhead of Unum’s\nDecember 27, 2006 termination of benefits letter as the place\nto send “additional information to support your request for\ndisability benefits.” Clerk’s Record 15-1 at 2-4.\n\n   Unum construed Dr. Proefrock’s letter as “new informa-\ntion,” but concluded that it did not “change [the] prior deci-\nsion” to terminate benefits. Id. at 9. Unum, however, never\ncommunicated this conclusion to Bilyeu or, for that matter,\ncontacted Bilyeu or Dr. Proefrock at all in response to the let-\nter. Compl. ¶ 27.\n\n   In November 2008, Bilyeu filed a complaint against Unum,\nalleging that Unum wrongfully terminated benefits under the\n24-month mental illness limitation because “[t]he substantial\nweight of the medical opinion contained in the claim file rea-\nsonably supports a finding that [her] disability is not due to\n‘mental illness,’ rather, it is due to an autoimmune condition\n\f7252              BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nwhich was exacerbated by anxiety and mental/emotional\nstressors in [her] life.” Id. ¶ 20. The complaint sought a rein-\nstatement of benefits under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). Id. at\n¶ 44.\n\n   Unum filed an answer and a counterclaim. In its counter-\nclaim, Unum sought reimbursement of overpaid long-term\ndisability benefits. Unum alleged that it had paid Bilyeu LTD\nbenefits subject to her promise to reimburse Unum for any\noverpayment arising from her receipt of disability benefits\nfrom any other source, including social security disability\nbenefits. Answer and Counterclaim ¶¶ 5-10. Bilyeu subse-\nquently received an award of social security benefits, result-\ning in an overpayment of LTD benefits in the amount of\n$36,597.82. Id. ¶¶ 11-12. Unum’s counterclaim sought to\nrecover the overpayment from Bilyeu. Specifically, Unum\nasserted a claim for equitable relief under ERISA, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1132(a)(3), as well as a claim for breach of contract. Id. at\n7-8.\n\n   Unum then moved to dismiss Bilyeu’s denial-of-benefits\nclaim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Clerk’s\nRecord 13. In that motion, Unum contended that the Decem-\nber 2006 termination of benefits letter required Bilyeu to file\na written appeal within 180 days, which she failed to do. Id.\nUnum thus sought dismissal of Bilyeu’s claim. The district\ncourt granted the motion, concluding that Bilyeu failed to\nexhaust administrative remedies and dismissing Bilyeu’s\nclaim with prejudice. Clerk’s Record 21 at 7.\n\n   Unum then filed a motion for summary judgment on its\ncounterclaim for reimbursement of overpaid benefits. Clerk’s\nRecord 28. Unum argued that it was entitled to relief under\nERISA because it “has an equitable lien by agreement over\nthe long-term disability benefits that it overpaid to Bilyeu.”\nId. at 1. Bilyeu opposed the motion, arguing that Unum could\nnot satisfy the requirements for an equitable lien by agree-\nment because it could not establish that the overpaid LTD\n\f                    BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY               7253\nbenefits remained in her possession. Clerk’s Record 30 at 2.\nThe parties stipulated that, by the time Bilyeu was awarded\nsocial security benefits, “she had dissipated at least a portion\nof her LTD benefits.” Joint Statement of Facts ¶ 15. The dis-\ntrict court granted Unum’s motion, and it directed the clerk of\ncourt “to enter judgment in the amount of $36,597.82 in favor\nof [Unum].” Clerk’s Record 32 at 6.\n\n  The court entered judgment and Bilyeu timely appealed.\nClerk’s Record 33, 35.\n\n              II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n   The district court dismissed Bilyeu’s denial-of-benefits\nclaim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-\ndure. Both parties, however, have relied on matters outside\nthe pleadings. Consistent with circuit practice addressing\nexhaustion, we construe Unum’s motion as an unenumerated\nmotion to dismiss. In addressing that motion, a court may\nlook beyond the pleadings and decide disputed issues of fact.\nSee Payne v. Peninsula Sch. Dist., 653 F.3d 863, 881 (9th Cir.\n2011) (en banc); Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, 1119-20\n(9th Cir. 2003). We review for an abuse of discretion a district\ncourt’s refusal to grant an exception to ERISA’s exhaustion\nrequirement. See Barboza v. Cal. Ass’n of Prof’l Firefighters,\n651 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 2011). We review de novo the\ngrant or denial of summary judgment. See Russell Country\nSportsmen v. U.S. Forest Serv., 668 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.\n2011).\n\n      III. BILYEU’S DENIAL-OF-BENEFITS\n   CLAIM: EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE\n                  REMEDIES\n\n  We hold that the district court abused its discretion by dis-\nmissing Bilyeu’s denial-of-benefits claim for a failure to\nexhaust administrative remedies.\n\f7254              BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\n   [1] “ERISA itself does not require a participant or benefi-\nciary to exhaust administrative remedies in order to bring an\naction under § 502 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1132.” Vaught v.\nScottsdale Healthcare Corp. Health Plan, 546 F.3d 620, 626\n(9th Cir. 2008). We have, however, adopted a “prudential\nexhaustion requirement.” Id. Thus, “[a]s a general rule, an\nERISA claimant must exhaust available administrative reme-\ndies before bringing a claim in federal court.” Barboza, 651\nF.3d at 1076. “However, when an employee benefits plan fails\nto establish or follow ‘reasonable claims procedures’ consis-\ntent with the requirements of ERISA, a claimant need not\nexhaust because his claims will be deemed exhausted.” Id.\n(quoting 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(l)). ERISA, moreover,\nrequires “a meaningful dialogue between ERISA plan admin-\nistrators and their beneficiaries.” Booton v. Lockheed Med.\nBenefit Plan, 110 F.3d 1461, 1463 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n   [2] Here, Unum’s December 27, 2006 termination of bene-\nfits letter advised Bilyeu of two courses of action, either of\nwhich she was required to undertake within 180 days: (a) pro-\nviding “additional information to support your request for dis-\nability benefits” or (b) “if you disagree with our determination\nand want to appeal this claim decision, you must submit a\nwritten appeal.” After receiving Unum’s letter, Bilyeu asked\nher treating physician, Dr. Proefrock, to respond, and he did\nso, writing a letter to Unum on April 19, 2007 — well within\nthe 180-day window required in Unum’s letter. Dr. Proefrock\naddressed his letter “To Whom It May Concern” and faxed it\nto 1-800-447-2498 — the number listed in the letterhead of\nUnum’s December 27, 2006 termination of benefits letter as\nthe place to send “additional information to support your\nrequest for disability benefits.”\n\n   Unum construed Dr. Proefrock’s letter as “new informa-\ntion,” but concluded that it did not “change [the] prior deci-\nsion” to terminate benefits. Unum, however, never\ncommunicated this conclusion to Bilyeu or, for that matter,\ncontacted Bilyeu or Dr. Proefrock at all in response to the let-\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                 7255\nter. Meanwhile, according to Unum, Bilyeu’s deadline to\nappeal expired sometime after June 25, 2007, 180 days after\nthe termination of benefits letter.\n\n   Under the circumstances of this case, exhaustion must be\nexcused. Bilyeu contends that she read the termination of ben-\nefits letter as presenting two options — she could either (a)\nsubmit additional information or (b) file a written appeal. The\nletter was ambiguous, so Bilyeu’s reading was not unreason-\nable. On the contrary, given that it would have made no sense\nto appeal the adverse benefits decision while simultaneously\nsubmitting additional medical information from her physician,\nas she was invited to do by Unum, her reading of the letter\nwas entirely appropriate.\n\n   We recognize that the letter is also susceptible to the read-\ning proffered by Unum — that Bilyeu was required to file an\nappeal within 180 days even if she submitted additional medi-\ncal information. But the letter could have been, and should\nhave been, much clearer on this point. Bilyeu was not repre-\nsented by counsel and, we presume, had no legal training. She\nshould not be saddled with a loss of her legal rights because\nshe misconstrued a confusingly worded communication from\nher plan’s claims administrator. Cf. Saffon v. Wells Fargo &\nCo. Long Term Disability Plan, 522 F.3d 863, 870 (9th Cir.\n2008) (“[The insurer’s] communications with [the insured]\nand her doctors are hardly a model of clarity; they certainly\ndo not explain ‘in a manner calculated to be understood by the\nclaimant’ what [she] must do to perfect her claim.”); White v.\nJacobs Eng’g Grp. Long Term Disability Benefit Plan, 896\nF.2d 344, 350 (9th Cir. 1990) (“When a benefits termination\nnotice fails to explain the proper steps for appeal, the plan’s\ntime bar is not triggered.”). A communication from a claims\nadministrator to a plan participant should clearly apprise her\nof her rights and obligations under the plan. Unum’s letter did\nnot do so. Nor did Bilyeu receive timely notice that Unum\n\f7256                 BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nconsidered her reading of the letter to be wrong, because\nUnum never responded to Dr. Proefrock’s timely letter.1\n\n   We hold that the district court abused its discretion by bar-\nring Bilyeu’s claim.\n\n              IV.    UNUM’S COUNTERCLAIM\n\nA.     Bilyeu Waived Her Argument That Unum Lacks\n       Statutory Standing as a Fiduciary\n\n   Bilyeu argues for the first time on appeal that Unum lacks\nstanding to seek equitable restitution under ERISA because\nUnum is not a plan “fiduciary.” This is a challenge to Unum’s\nstatutory standing. Cf. Leeson v. Transamerica Disability\nIncome Plan, 671 F.3d 969, 971 (9th Cir. 2012) (“Whether\n[the plaintiff] is a participant for purposes of ERISA is a sub-\nstantive element of his claim, not a prerequisite for subject\nmatter jurisdiction.”); Harris v. Amgen, Inc., 573 F.3d 728,\n732 n.3 (9th Cir. 2009) (same); Vaughn v. Bay Envtl. Mgmt.,\nInc., 567 F.3d 1021, 1024 (9th Cir. 2009) (same); Parker v.\nBain, 68 F.3d 1131, 1138 (9th Cir. 1995) (treating a plain-\ntiff ’s status as a “fiduciary” under ERISA as a question of\nstatutory standing).\n\n   Unlike constitutional standing, which is jurisdictional, we\npresume that statutory standing may be waived. See Leeson,\n671 F.3d at 975 n.12; cf. Pershing Park Villas Homeowners\nAss’n v. United Pac. Ins. Co., 219 F.3d 895, 899 (9th Cir.\n2000) (distinguishing constitutional standing from prudential\nstanding, and holding that “a party waives objections to non-\n  1\n   We disagree with the dissent’s conclusion that the outcome of this case\nis controlled by Diaz v. United Agricultural Employee Welfare Benefit\nPlan & Trust, 50 F.3d 1478, 1481-83 (9th Cir. 1995). In Diaz, the\nemployee failed to follow the plan’s unambiguous instructions to file an\nappeal within 60 days after a decision denying benefits. Diaz involved nei-\nther ambiguous communications nor a failure to engage in a meaningful\ndialogue.\n\f                   BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                     7257\nconstitutional standing not properly raised before the district\ncourt”); Sycuan Band of Mission Indians v. Roache, 54 F.3d\n535, 538 (9th Cir. 1995) (same). By failing to raise this argu-\nment before the district court, Bilyeu thus waived her chal-\nlenge to Unum’s standing as a fiduciary under ERISA.\n\nB.   The District Court Improperly Awarded Legal Relief\n\n   Unum paid Bilyeu long-term disability benefits pursuant to\nBilyeu’s agreement to reimburse Unum “any overpayment\nresulting from my receipt of benefits from other sources.”\nJoint Statement of Facts ¶ 12. The agreement stated in perti-\nnent part:\n\n     Please pay me the disability benefit with no reduc-\n     tion for amounts received by other sources until a\n     final determination of my eligibility to receive those\n     benefits is made. I understand that this may result in\n     an overpayment by the Insurer. I agree to notify the\n     Insurer within 48 hours of receiving notice of any\n     and all decisions, to supply the Insurer with a copy\n     of the final decision, and to repay any overpayment\n     incurred as a result of receiving any other benefits\n     from those sources specified in the policy. . . .\n\n     By selecting [this] Option . . . , I understand that the\n     Insurer has agreed to pay me an unreduced benefit\n     based upon my written promise herein to pay the\n     Insurer any overpayment resulting from my receipt\n     of benefits from other sources, as outlined in my pol-\n     icy. I agree to reimburse the Insurer any such over-\n     payment within thirty (30) days of my receipt of\n     such funds.\n\n     If I fail to pay the Insurer the overpayment within the\n     thirty (30) day period specified above, I understand\n     that the Insurer may reduce future payments under\n     the policy in order to recover the overpaid benefits.\n\f7258                 BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\n      I also understand that I shall be liable to the Insurer\n      for the full amount of any such overpayment, plus\n      applicable statutory interest, and for all reasonable\n      costs (including attorney’s fees) of collection of the\n      overpaid benefits.\n\nId. Bilyeu subsequently received social security disability\nbenefits, but did not reimburse Unum. Id. ¶¶ 16-19. Unum\nfiled a counterclaim for reimbursement of the overpaid bene-\nfits.\n\n   [3] Ordinarily, a contracting party in Unum’s position\nwould file a claim for breach of contract and seek relief in the\nform of a judgment for money damages.2 Under ERISA, how-\never, a plan fiduciary such as Unum can seek only “equitable\nrelief” from a plan participant such as Bilyeu. 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1132(a)(3)(B). Section 1132(a) provides:\n\n      A civil action may be brought . . . (3) by a partici-\n      pant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act\n      or practice which violates any provision of this sub-\n      chapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain\n      other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such\n      violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this\n      subchapter or the terms of the plan.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1132(a) (emphasis added). Unum therefore can-\nnot sue for damages under ERISA; it must show that it is\nseeking equitable relief.\n\n  Unum contends it has made this showing because it is seek-\n  2\n   Unum has, in fact, asserted a state-law claim for breach of contract.\nClerk’s Record 5 at 7-8 (Answer and Counterclaim); Clerk’s Record 28\nat 8 (motion for summary judgment). Bilyeu contends Unum has aban-\ndoned that claim and that, in any event, the claim is preempted by ERISA.\nClerk’s Record 30 at 9. Unum’s contract claim has not been adjudicated,\nand we express no opinion as to its merits.\n\f                        BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                         7259\ning an equitable lien by agreement. Clerk’s Record 28 at 1, 6-\n7; Answering Brief at 36. The Supreme Court has recognized\nan equitable lien by agreement as a form of “equitable relief”\nauthorized by § 1132(a)(3)(B). See Sereboff v. Mid Atl. Med.\nServs., Inc., 547 U.S. 356, 364-65 (2006).3 The only question,\ntherefore, is whether Unum has satisfied the requirements for\nan equitable lien by agreement in this case. We begin by sum-\nmarizing Sereboff.\n\n   The Sereboffs were beneficiaries of a health insurance plan\ngoverned by ERISA and administered by Mid Atlantic. See\nid. at 359. The plan provided for payment of covered medical\nexpenses, subject to an “Acts of Third Parties” provision\nrequiring a beneficiary to reimburse Mid Atlantic in the event\nof recovery from a third-party tortfeasor. See id. This provi-\nsion applied when a beneficiary was sick or injured as a result\nof the act or omission of another person or party, and required\na beneficiary who received benefits under the plan for such\ninjuries to reimburse Mid Atlantic for those benefits from all\nrecoveries from a third party, whether by lawsuit, settlement\n  3\n  An equitable lien by agreement is a traditional form of equitable relief.\nAccording to Pomeroy’s Treatise on Equity,\n      The doctrine may be stated in its most general form, that every\n      express executory agreement in writing, whereby the contracting\n      party sufficiently indicates an intention to make some particular\n      property, real or personal, or fund, therein described or identified,\n      a security for a debt or other obligation, or whereby the party\n      promises to convey or assign or transfer the property as security,\n      creates an equitable lien upon the property so indicated, which is\n      enforceable against the property in the hands not only of the orig-\n      inal contractor, but of his heirs, administrators, executors, volun-\n      tary assignees, and purchasers or encumbrancers with notice.\n      Under like circumstances, a merely verbal agreement may create\n      a similar lien upon personal property.\n4 John Norton Pomeroy, A Treatise on Equity § 1235, p. 696 (5th ed.\n1941); see also Restatement (Third) of Restitution § 56 cmt. d (2011)\n(“[T]he failure to transfer a promised share of an identifiable fund may\njustify specific relief to the claimant, frequently accomplished via equita-\nble lien.”).\n\f7260               BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nor otherwise. See id. After the Sereboffs were injured in an\nautomobile accident and the plan paid their medical expenses,\nthe Sereboffs recovered a tort settlement from third parties.\nSee id. at 360. Mid Atlantic filed suit under ERISA seeking\nto recover their medical payments from the Sereboffs’ tort\nrecovery. See id. The Sereboffs agreed to set aside from the\ntort recovery a sum equal to the amount Mid Atlantic claimed,\nand to preserve that sum in a segregated investment account\npending the outcome of the suit. See id.\n\n   The Supreme Court held that Mid Atlantic could enforce\nthe terms of the Acts of Third Parties provision through an\nequitable lien by agreement — “the familiar rul[e] of equity\nthat a contract to convey a specific object even before it is\nacquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets\na title to the thing.” Id. at 363-64 (alteration in original) (quot-\ning Barnes v. Alexander, 232 U.S. 117, 121 (1914)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Sereboff’s promise to reimburse\nMid Atlantic from any recovery from a third party created a\nlien upon that recovery as soon as it was created. See id. at\n364. Mid Atlantic was allowed to follow a portion of the tort\nrecovery into the Sereboffs’ hands, and to impose upon that\nportion an equitable lien. See id.\n\n   The Court also made clear that, to satisfy the requirements\nfor an equitable lien by agreement, Mid Atlantic was not\nrequired to trace the funds in the Sereboffs’ tort recovery back\nto Mid Atlantic’s own possession. See id. at 364-65. The Sere-\nboffs had argued that “strict tracing rules” applied to a claim\nfor equitable restitution. See Reply Brief for Petitioners at 8-\n11, Sereboff v. Mid Atl. Med. Servs., Inc., 547 U.S. 356 (2006)\n(No. 05-260), 2006 WL 717048 at *8-11. They maintained\nthat Mid Atlantic could not satisfy those tracing rules because\nits “claim is not for return of particular money that the Plan\npaid to the Sereboffs,” but rather was a claim to “recover new\nmoney paid out by third parties.” Id. at 9.\n\n   The Court declined to say whether a rule requiring the\nplaintiff to trace the fund or property back to the plaintiff’s\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                  7261\nown possession would apply to a claim for equitable restitu-\ntion. That question was beside the point, because Mid Atlantic\nwas seeking an equitable lien by agreement, not equitable res-\ntitution. With regard to an equitable lien by agreement, the\nCourt held that “no tracing requirement of the sort asserted by\nthe Sereboffs applies.” Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 365 (emphasis\nadded). The Court’s decision in Barnes confirmed that this\nwas the case: “The plaintiffs in Barnes could not identify an\nasset they originally possessed, which was improperly\nacquired and converted into property the defendant held, yet\nthat did not preclude them from securing an equitable lien”\nover a specifically identified fund. Id. The Court did not pur-\nport to do away with the long established principle that an\nequitable lien by agreement applies only to “particular funds\nor property in the defendant’s possession.” CIGNA Corp. v.\nAmara, 131 S. Ct. 1866, 1879 (2011) (second emphasis\nadded) (quoting Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knud-\nson, 534 U.S. 204, 213 (2002)) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n   [4] As relevant here, we read Sereboff as establishing at\nleast three criteria for securing an equitable lien by agreement\nin an ERISA action. First, there must be a promise by the\nbeneficiary to reimburse the fiduciary for benefits paid under\nthe plan in the event of a recovery from a third party. Second,\nthe reimbursement agreement must “specifically identif[y] a\nparticular fund, distinct from the [beneficiary’s] general\nassets,” from which the fiduciary will be reimbursed. Id. at\n364. Third, the funds specifically identified by the fiduciary\nmust be “within the possession and control of the [benefi-\nciary].” Id. at 363.\n\n   1. Here, the first criterion is clearly satisfied. Bilyeu does\nnot dispute that she promised to reimburse Unum for an over-\npayment of long-term disability benefits arising from her\nreceipt of benefits from other sources, including social secur-\nity disability benefits.\n\f7262               BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\n   2. It is less clear whether the second criterion is satisfied.\nUnum contends that the reimbursement agreement specifi-\ncally identified the overpaid long-term disability benefits as\nthe particular fund, distinct from Bilyeu’s general assets, from\nwhich it is to be reimbursed. In Unum’s view, once Bilyeu\nreceived her social security disability benefits, the specifically\nidentified fund — the overpaid long-term disability benefits\n— came into existence, and Unum was allowed to impose a\nlien against that fund. This argument is plausible, but prob-\nlematic. Unlike the third party tort recovery in Sereboff and\nthe contingency fee in Barnes, the overpaid disability benefits\nare not a particular fund, but a specific amount of money\nencompassed within a particular fund — the long-term dis-\nability benefits Unum paid to Bilyeu. As an amount of money,\nthe overpayment is specific. As property or as a fund, how-\never, the overpayment is lacking in specificity because it is an\nundifferentiated component of a larger fund. The overpay-\nment has never existed as a distinct object or fund. See 53\nC.J.S. Liens § 19 (2012) (“In order that an equitable lien may\narise by contract, the agreement of the parties must deal with\nsome specific property, and it is also essential that the prop-\nerty or fund intended to be appropriated or charged should be\nidentified or described with a reasonable degree of certainty.”\n(emphasis added) (footnote omitted)); 4 John Norton\nPomeroy, A Treatise on Equity § 1235, p. 696 (5th ed. 1941)\n(explaining that an equitable lien applies to “some particular\nproperty, real or personal, or fund, therein described or identi-\nfied” (emphasis added)); Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 364 (holding\nthat the requirements for an equitable lien by agreement were\nsatisfied because the “plan specifically identified a particular\nfund” (emphasis added)); Barnes, 232 U.S. at 121 (holding\nthat “a contract to convey a specific object even before it is\nacquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets\na title to the thing” (emphasis added)).\n\n   Unum’s reimbursement agreement would have avoided\nthese problems if, consistent with Sereboff, it had identified\nthe third party recovery — here, Bilyeu’s social security dis-\n\f                        BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                         7263\nability benefits — as the particular fund enlisted to serve as\nsecurity for the overpayment of benefits. Of course, that\nwould not have worked in this case: Under the Social Security\nAct, Bilyeu could not assign her social security benefits, and\nUnum could not attach them. See 42 U.S.C. § 407(a).4 “The\npurpose of the exemption created by Congress in 42 U.S.C.\n§ 407 is to protect social security beneficiaries from creditors’\nclaims.” Dionne v. Bouley, 757 F.2d 1344, 1355 (1st Cir.\n1985). By identifying the overpaid benefits as the particular\nfund, rather than the social security benefits, Unum attempts\nto circumvent the congressional prohibition on assignment\nand attachment of social security benefits.\n\n   [5] 3. Even assuming that Unum could satisfy the second\ncriterion, Unum has not satisfied the third criterion — the\nrequirement that the specifically identified fund be within\nBilyeu’s “possession and control.” Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 363.\nIn Sereboff, Mid Atlantic sought to recover specifically identi-\nfied funds that were “within the possession and control of the\nSereboffs, . . . set aside and preserved in the Sereboffs’ invest-\nment accounts.” Id. (alteration and internal quotation marks\nomitted). That the funds were extant, and in the Sereboffs’\npossession, was essential to the Court’s holding that Mid\nAtlantic was seeking equitable, rather than legal, relief. See\nid. at 362-63.\n\n   Here, by contrast, Bilyeu asserts, and Unum has not\nrefuted, that Bilyeu has spent the overpaid benefits.5 Unum,\n  4\n   Section 407 states:\n      The right of any person to any future payment under this sub-\n      chapter shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity,\n      and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under\n      this subchapter shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment,\n      garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any\n      bankruptcy or insolvency law.\n42 U.S.C. § 407(a).\n  5\n    The burden to show that the overpaid benefits remain in Bilyeu’s pos-\nsession presumably falls on Unum. See Restatement (First) of Restitution\n\f7264                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\ntherefore, is not seeking to recover a specified fund that is\npreserved and in Bilyeu’s possession. Instead, Unum is seek-\ning a judgment requiring Bilyeu to pay money out of her gen-\neral assets. In Sereboff’s words, Unum is seeking “the\nimposition of personal liability,” rather than enforcement of\nan “equitable lien on particular property.” Id. at 362 (quoting\nKnudson, 534 U.S. at 214) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThis is quintessentially legal, rather than equitable, relief. See\nMertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 255 (1993) (“Money\ndamages are, of course, the classic form of legal relief.”).\n\n   We recognize that a number of circuits have interpreted\nSereboff’s discussion of tracing rules as a signal that a fidu-\nciary can assert an equitable lien — presumably against a ben-\neficiary’s general assets — even if the beneficiary no longer\npossesses the specifically identified funds. See Funk v.\nCIGNA Grp. Ins., 648 F.3d 182, 194 n.14 (3d Cir. 2011)\n(opining that Sereboff “strongly implies that . . . the defendant\nneed not possess the property at the time relief is sought in\norder for the relief to be equitable — any post-agreement pos-\nsession will suffice”); Cusson v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.\nof Boston, 592 F.3d 215, 231 (1st Cir. 2010) (holding that the\ninsurer’s claim was for equitable relief under § 1132(a)(3),\neven though the insurer “has not identified a specific account\nin which the funds are kept or proven that they are still in [the\nparticipant’s] possession,” because “the contract between [the\nparticipant] and [the insurer] put [the participant] on notice\nthat she would be required to reimburse [the insurer] for an\namount equal to what she might get from Social Security”);\nLongaberger Co. v.

Standard Select Trust Ins.\nPlans, 530 F.3d 614, 621 (7th Cir. 2008) (allowing a claim\nunder “29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3) even if the benefits it paid [the\nbeneficiary] are not specifically traceable to [the benefi-\nciary’s] current assets because of commingling or dissipa-\ntion”); Gilchrest v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., 255 F. App’x\n38, 44-45 (6th Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (holding that the par-\nticipant’s “undisputed averment that the overpayments had\nbeen dissipated would seem to be of no avail,” because Sereb-\noff “clarified that to establish an equitable lien by agreement,\nstrict tracing of funds is not required”). But see Epolito v.\nPrudential Ins. Co. of Am., 737 F. Supp. 2d 1364, 1380 (M.D.\nFla. 2010) (“[T]his Court is not convinced that Sereboff’s\nholding eliminates the requirement that the insurer identify an\nintact, identifiable res, in the possession of the insured, on\nwhich it seeks to impose the equitable lien.”); cf. Amschwand\nv. Spherion Corp., 505 F.3d 342, 346 (5th Cir. 2007) (“[T]he\nsine qua non of restitutionary recovery available under\n§ 502(a)(3) is a defendant’s possession of the disputed res.”);\nid. at 347 (“[P]ossession is the key to awarding equitable res-\ntitution in the form of a constructive trust or equitable lien.”).\n\n  We are unpersuaded by the view of those other circuits.\nThe tracing issue in Sereboff was whether Mid Atlantic could\nobtain an equitable lien against specifically identified funds\nwhen Mid Atlantic had never possessed those funds itself —\nan issue that has no relevance here. See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at\n364-65. Nothing in Sereboff suggests that a fiduciary can\nenforce an equitable lien against a beneficiary’s general\nassets when specifically identified funds are no longer in a\nbeneficiary’s possession.\n\n   This conclusion — that the fiduciary must recover from\nspecifically identified funds in the beneficiary’s possession,\nrather than from general assets — is consistent not only with\nSereboff but also with the Supreme Court’s decisions in\nKnudson and CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 131 S. Ct. 1866 (2011).\n\f7266               BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nIn Knudson, the Court said, “where the property sought to be\nrecovered or its proceeds have been dissipated so that no\nproduct remains, the plaintiff’s claim is only that of a general\ncreditor, and the plaintiff cannot enforce a constructive trust\nof or an equitable lien upon other property of the defendant.”\n534 U.S. at 213-14 (alterations and internal quotation marks\nomitted) (quoting Restatement (First) of Restitution § 215\ncmt. a, p. 867 (1936)). In Amara, decided just last Term, the\nCourt once again underscored that, “traditionally speaking,\nrelief that sought a lien or a constructive trust was legal relief,\nnot equitable relief, unless the funds in question were ‘partic-\nular funds or property in the defendant’s possession.’ ” 131 S.\nCt. at 1879 (second emphasis added) (quoting Knudson, 534\nU.S. at 213). Here, Unum has arguably identified a particular\nfund — the overpaid benefits — but that fund is no longer in\nBilyeu’s possession.\n\n   Unum’s argument that an equitable lien can be enforced\nagainst general assets when the specifically identified prop-\nerty has been dissipated finds no support in the traditional\ndoctrine governing equitable liens by agreement. See 4\nPomeroy, A Treatise on Equity § 1235, p. 696 (5th ed. 1941)\n(explaining that an equitable lien may be enforced when the\nspecifically identified property is in the hands of the contrac-\ntor — or in the hands of a subsequent possessor with notice\nof the lien, a qualification not relevant to Bilyeu’s case). If the\nproperty or fund subject to the lien (or proceeds to which the\nproperty or fund can be traced), are no longer in the defen-\ndant’s possession, then there is no res against which the equi-\ntable lien can be enforced. See 53 C.J.S. Liens § 46 (2012)\n(“[A] lien that is not satisfied voluntarily may be enforced by\nan action to foreclose, in which a court may order the property\nsecuring the debt or obligation to be sold and its proceeds\napplied on the demand of the creditor in whose favor the lien\nexists.” (footnote omitted)); Restatement (First) of Restitution\n§ 161 cmt. e (1937) (“An equitable lien can be established and\nenforced only if there is some property which is subject to the\nlien. Where property is subject to an equitable lien and the\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                  7267\nowner of the property disposes of it and acquires other prop-\nerty in exchange, he holds the property so acquired subject to\nthe lien . . . . So also, where the property which is subject to\nthe lien is mingled with other property in one indistinguish-\nable mass, the lien can be enforced against the mingled mass\n. . . . Where, however, the property subject to the equitable\nlien can no longer be traced, the equitable lien cannot be\nenforced . . . .” (emphasis added)); id. § 215(1) (“[W]here a\nperson wrongfully disposes of the property of another but the\nproperty cannot be traced into any product, the other has\nmerely a personal claim against the wrongdoer and cannot\nenforce a constructive trust or lien upon any part of the\nwrongdoer’s property.”); id. § 215 cmt. a (“[I]f it is shown\nthat the property or its proceeds have been dissipated so that\nno product remains, . . . the claimant cannot enforce . . . an\nequitable lien upon other property of the wrongdoer, and has\nonly a personal claim against the wrongdoer.”); Restatement\n(Third) of Restitution § 58 cmt. c (2011) (“To obtain a prop-\nerty interest in something other than the original asset, and not\nmerely restitution of its value in money, the claimant must\nnormally show that the property claimed is the traceable prod-\nuct of the original asset.”); id. § 60(3) (“A claimant who is\nentitled to restitution but who is unable to identify specific\nproperty from which restitution is available has a remedy via\nmoney judgment that ranks equally with the claims of general\ncreditors.”).\n\n   In sum, although the district court’s decision may have pro-\nduced an equitable result, the court erred because Unum has\nnot shown that it is seeking equitable relief. We remand,\naffording Unum the opportunity to establish that it has identi-\nfied a particular fund (the second criterion) and that the over-\npaid long-term disability benefits, or assets to which the\noverpaid benefits can be traced, remain in Bilyeu’s possession\n(the third criterion). See 53 C.J.S. Liens § 24 (2012) (“An\nequitable lien for advances may exist where advancements of\nmoney or funds are made on the faith of certain property, real\nor personal, under an agreement or circumstances showing\n\f7268                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nthat it was the intention of the parties to pledge such property\nas security for the advancements, provided the specific prop-\nerty or its proceeds on which the advancements were invested\ncan be traced or identified.” (emphasis added) (footnote omit-\nted)); 2 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies § 6.1(4) (2d ed.\n1993) (discussing enforcement of an equitable lien in the case\nof commingled funds).6\n\n   There is much to be said for maintaining uniformity among\nthe federal circuits, and we should strive to do so when we\ncan. See Am. Vantage Cos. v. Table Mountain Rancheria, 292\nF.3d 1091, 1098 (9th Cir. 2002). ERISA, however, provides\nonly for “equitable relief,” 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)(B), and\nUnum has not shown that the relief granted here — “judgment\nin the amount of $36,597.82 in favor of First Unum Life\nInsurance Company,” to be paid out of Bilyeu’s general assets\n— falls into that category. The district court did not identify\na particular fund and impose upon it an equitable lien. Instead,\nthe district court’s order reads like a money judgment, which\nis what it is. As we explained in Bonneville Power Adminis-\ntration v. Washington Public Power Supply System, 956 F.2d\n1497 (9th Cir. 1992),\n  6\n    The kind of tracing we discuss here is distinct from the theory of trac-\ning rejected in Sereboff. The issue in Sereboff was whether a plaintiff is\nrequired to trace the specific property or particular fund back to the plain-\ntiff’s own possession. Sereboff makes clear that that sort of tracing is not\nrequired for an equitable lien by agreement. See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 364-\n65. The kind of tracing we refer to here simply allows a plaintiff to trace\nthe specific property or a particular fund when the defendant has either\ncommingled it with the defendant’s other assets or exchanged it for other\nproperty See 53 C.J.S. Liens § 29 (2012) (“[W]here the owner of property\nsubject to a lien commingles it with other property alike in quality and\nvalue, the lien is not extinguished so long as there is on hand sufficient\nproperty alike in quality and value to satisfy the lien.”); id. § 49 (“If the\nproperty on which an equitable lien is held has been sold before foreclo-\nsure, the court can trace the funds from the sale and impress a lien upon\nany property acquired with the proceeds.”); Restatement (Third) of Resti-\ntution §§ 58-59 (2011) (describing tracing principles as applied to equita-\nble liens and constructive trusts).\n\f                     BILYEU v.

Therefore\n      the court erred in granting . . . a lien on funds.\n\nId. at 1507 (citation omitted) (quoting Restatement (First) of\nRestitution § 161 cmt. e (1937)).7 We are bound to adhere to\nthat principle today.\n\n                        V.    CONCLUSION\n\n   The district court abused its discretion by dismissing\nBilyeu’s denial-of-benefits claim for a failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies. The court also erred when it con-\ncluded that Unum had satisfied the requirements for an equi-\ntable lien by agreement. The judgment of the district court is\ntherefore vacated and the case is remanded for further pro-\nceedings.\n\n  VACATED AND REMANDED. Costs of appeal are\nawarded to Bilyeu.\n\n\n\n\n  7\n    We recognize that “the fact that . . . relief takes the form of a money\npayment does not [necessarily] remove it from the category of tradition-\nally equitable relief.” Amara, 131 S. Ct. at 1880. Here, however, Unum\nhas not advanced a specific theory under which the money judgment\nagainst Bilyeu falls within a traditional form of equitable relief. Whether\nsome form of equitable relief might be available here, as well as whether\nUnum could reformulate its reimbursement agreement to resolve the prob-\nlems presented here, are thus questions beyond the scope of this appeal.\n\f7270               BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nRAWLINSON, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part:\n\n  I agree with the majority that Plaintiff Leah Bilyeu (Bilyeu)\nwaived her argument that Unum Life Insurance Company\n(Unum) lacks statutory standing. I respectfully disagree on all\nother issues.\n\n   Bilyeu argues on appeal, as she did before the district court,\nthat a fax sent by her physician Dr. Proefrock to Dr. Hogan,\nthe physician for Unum, satisfied the exhaustion requirement\nunder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n(ERISA). However, the letter denying Bilyeu’s claim explic-\nitly directed her that if she disagreed with the determination\ndenying disability benefits, she was required to submit an\nappeal in writing to: First Unum Life Insurance Company at\nPO Box 100158, Columbia, SC 29202-3158, Fax: 1-800-447-\n2498 www.unumprovident.com.\n\n   Rather than submitting an appeal as directed, Bilyeu\nelected to provide additional information pursuant to a differ-\nent paragraph of the denial letter. This information was sent\nto Unum’s physician advisor rather than to the benefits center\nas directed in the denial letter from Unum.\n\n   The district court found that because the letter from\nBilyeu’s physician to Unum’s physician did not comply with\nthe appeal procedure, Bilyeu did not exhaust the administra-\ntive remedies available under the ERISA Plan. We review this\ndetermination for an abuse of discretion. See Diaz v. United\nAgricultural Employee Welfare Benefit Plan and Trust, 50\nF.3d 1478, 1483 (9th Cir. 1995).\n\n  A district court abuses it discretion only if the district court\napplied an incorrect legal rule in view of the relief requested\nor made a factual finding that was “illogical, implausible, or\nwithout support in inferences that may be drawn from the\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                 7271\nrecord.” United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247, 1263 (9th\nCir. 2009) (footnote reference omitted).\n\n   The district court explained its ruling by observing that the\nletter from Bilyeu’s physician did not indicate that Bilyeu\ndesired to appeal the Plan’s decision. See District Court Opin-\nion, p. 6. The district court also noted that the letter from\nBilyeu’s physician was faxed to Unum’s physician advisor\nrather than to Unum, as instructed in the communication from\nUnum to Bilyeu. See id. Because the letter from Bilyeu’s phy-\nsician did not comply with the appeal procedure and did not\nseek administrative review, the district court found that\nBilyeu failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies.\nSee id. The district court specifically ruled that Bilyeu’s sub-\nmission of additional medical information was no substitute\nfor filing an appeal as directed.\n\n   The district court correctly identified and applied governing\nprecedent. As noted in Diaz, 50 F.3d at 1483, “[e]arly in\nERISA’s history,” we established the general rule requiring\nexhaustion of administrative remedies. See also Mack v.\nKuckenmeister, 619 F.3d 1010, 1020 (9th Cir. 2010). We con-\ncluded that exhaustion of administrative remedies is war-\nranted because exhaustion is consistent with the legislative\nstructure of ERISA. We also reasoned that the exhaustion\nrequirement advances “important policy considerations,\nincluding the reduction of frivolous litigation, the promotion\nof consistent treatment of claims, the provision of a nonadver-\nsarial method of claims settlement, the minimization of costs\nof claim settlement and a proper reliance on administrative\nexpertise. . . .” Id., citing Amato v. Bernard, 618 F.2d 559,\n566-68 (9th Cir. 1980).\n\n   The district court faithfully adhered to this precedent when\nit precluded Bilyeu’s claim due to her failure to submit an\nappeal to Unum, the benefits administrator. See Diaz, 50 F.3d\nat 1483 (“By not submitting a written appeal to the Benefits\nAdministrator, [the Plaintiff] failed to comply with the Plan’s\n\f7272              BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\ninternal review procedures and hence did not exhaust the\navailable administrative remedies. . . .”); see also Sarraf v.\nStandard Insurance Co., 102 F.3d 991, 993 (9th Cir. 1996)\n(“Under Diaz, [Plaintiff’s] failure to request in writing review\nof the Administrator’s adverse decision precludes the instant\nclaims under the ERISA plan.”), citing Diaz, 50 F.3d at 1483.\n\n   Because the district court followed well-established prece-\ndent in requiring exhaustion of the prescribed administrative\nremedy, the majority understandably refrains from holding\nthat the district court abused its discretion by applying an\nincorrect legal rule. Rather, the majority excuses Bilyeu’s lack\nof exhaustion by attributing to Unum a purported failure “to\nestablish or follow reasonable claims procedures.” Majority\nOpinion, p. 7254. The majority cites to Barboza v. Cal. Ass’n\nof Prof’l Firefighters, 651 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2011) as sup-\nport for its holding. However, that case bears little resem-\nblance to this case and is not controlling or compelling. In\nBarboza, the ERISA beneficiary did not receive a timely\ndetermination of the Plan’s decision. See Barboza, 651 F.3d\nat 1078. No similar allegation was made in this case. In Bar-\nboza, the issue was whether the Plan provisions complied\nwith ERISA regulations. See id. at 1077. No similar issue\nexists in this case. In Barboza we deferred to the interpreta-\ntion of the Secretary of Labor regarding the proper resolution\nof “conflicting interpretations” of an ERISA regulation. Id. at\n1079. No interpretation of an ERISA regulation was involved\nin this case. Rather, the district court in this case was called\nupon to decide whether Bilyeu perfected her appeal by send-\ning additional information to the Plan’s physician rather than\nchallenging the denial of benefits by directing an appeal to\nUnum at the address provided.\n\n   The majority concedes that the provisions of the denial let-\nter sent to Bilyeu were susceptible to the reading argued by\nUnum as well as the reading urged by Bilyeu. See Majority\nOpinion, p. 7255. That concession guts the majority’s analy-\nsis, because a decisionmaker’s choice between two viable\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                  7273\ninterpretations of the facts cannot constitute abuse of discre-\ntion as a matter of law. See Hinkson, 585 F.3d at 1260\n(“Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the\nfactfinder’s choice between them cannot be clearly errone-\nous.”) (citation omitted). The district court acted within its\ndiscretion when it concluded that Bilyeu failed to exhaust the\nadministrative remedies available under the ERISA plan\nadministered by Unum. No legal or factual basis exists for\nreversing the district court’s ruling. Quite simply, as we stated\nin Diaz, “[b]y not submitting a written appeal to the Benefits\nAdministrator, [Bilyeu] failed to comply with the Plan’s inter-\nnal review procedures and hence did not exhaust the available\nadministrative remedies. . . .” Diaz, 50 F.3d at 1483 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n   I also part company with the majority in its analysis of the\ndistrict court’s ruling on the merits of Unum’s counterclaim.\n\n   Like the majority opinion, I start my analysis with the\nUnited States Supreme Court’s decision in Sereboff v. Mid\nAtlantic Medical Services, Inc., 547 U.S. 356, 362-63 (2006).\nIn that case, the Supreme Court addressed the circumstances\nunder which an ERISA fiduciary may sue an ERISA benefi-\nciary for reimbursement when the beneficiary recovers from\na third party. See id. at 359. The Supreme Court relied on the\nequitable rule that an obligation to convey specific proceeds\nimposes a constructive trust on those proceeds. See id. at 362-\n64.\n\n   Applying the precepts of Sereboff to the facts of this case,\nI reach the same conclusion as the majority opinion regarding\nthe existence of an equitable trust. The ERISA Plan provided\nthat Bilyeu could receive full long-term disability benefits\npremised upon her agreement to reimburse Unum for any\noverpayment due to receipt of benefits from any other\nsources. Thus, any overpayment due to receipt of benefits\nfrom other sources would constitute the particular fund to\nwhich a constructive lien in favor of Unum applied.\n\f7274              BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\n   Although all parties agree that Bilyeu was obligated to\nreimburse Unum, the majority opinion lets Bilyeu off the\nhook, accepting her argument that she has already spent the\nmoney paid to her by Unum and, therefore, those specific pro-\nceeds can never be recovered. In doing so, the majority opin-\nion creates an unwarranted circuit split and completely\ndisregards the concept of fairness, the paramount principle of\nequity. See Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.S.\n124, 133 (1995).\n\n   In Cusson v. Liberty Life Insurance Co. of Boston, 592 F.3d\n215, 231-32 (1st Cir. 2010), the First Circuit considered a\ncase also involving overpayment of long-term disability bene-\nfits due to the receipt of social security benefits by the claim-\nant.\n\n   The claimant argued that the ERISA fiduciary advanced a\nlegal claim rather than an equitable claim, and therefore, the\nclaim was barred. See id. at 230. The First Circuit rejected this\nargument, concluding that it was inconsistent with the\nSupreme Court’s reasoning in Sereboff. See id. at 231. The\nFirst Circuit concluded that the rule of equity imposes a con-\nstructive trust on the proceeds as soon as they are acquired by\nthe recipient of those proceeds. See id. The First Circuit rea-\nsoned that because the contract between the ERISA fiduciary\nand the ERISA beneficiary put the ERISA beneficiary on\nnotice that reimbursement would be required if the ERISA\nbeneficiary was overpaid, enforcement of the resulting con-\nstructive trust constituted equitable relief. See id. Because the\ncircumstances in Cusson are virtually identical to the facts in\nthis case, there is no principled basis upon which Cusson can\nbe distinguished.\n\n   Similarly applying Sereboff, the Third Circuit in Funk v.\nCigna Grp. Ins., 648 F.3d 182, 194 (3d Cir. 2011) held that\n“there is no tracing requirement for an equitable lien by agree-\nment. Property to which the lien attached may be converted\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                 7275\ninto other property without affecting the efficacy of the lien.”\n(citations and footnote reference omitted).\n\n   In Gilchrest v. Unum Life Insurance Co. of America, 255\nF. App’x 38 (6th Cir. 2007) (unpublished), the Sixth Circuit\ninterpreted Sereboff in a similar fashion, ruling that the\nenforcement of a constructive trust does not require “strict\ntracing of funds.” Id. at 45. Rather, the ERISA fiduciary must\nmerely identify a specific fund distinct from the general assets\nof the ERISA beneficiary for satisfaction of the ERISA fidu-\nciary’s equitable claim. This requirement was met by identify-\ning the proceeds of recoveries from any third party. See id.\nThis holding was reiterated in Longaberger Co. v. Kolt, 586\nF.3d 459, 466 (6th Cir. 2009), with the Sixth Circuit declaring\nin a published opinion that “an equitable lien by agreement\ndoes not require tracing or maintenance of a fund in order for\nequity to allow repayment,” and citing Gilchrest with\napproval.\n\n   The Seventh Circuit reached the same result in Gutta v.\nStandard Select Trust Ins. Plans, 530 F.3d 614 (7th Cir.\n2008). Applying Sereboff, the Seventh Circuit recognized a\ndistinction between the “equitable lien by agreement” created\nby the reimbursement provision in the ERISA plan document\nand “an equitable lien sought as a matter of restitution.” Spe-\ncifically, for the former, “strict tracing of the funds to be\nrecovered was not required [under Sereboff]”. Id. at 620\n(quoting Sereboff, 126 S. Ct. at 1875). This distinction is per-\nsuasive in view of the express agreement by the beneficiary\nto reimburse the ERISA plan for any overpayment, without\nany limitation regarding the funding source of the repayment.\n\n   In Dillard’s Inc. v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 456 F.3d\n894 (8th Cir. 2006), the Eighth Circuit followed the approach\ntaken by the First, Sixth and Seventh Circuits. The Eighth Cir-\ncuit determined that the Supreme Court’s ruling in Sereboff\nprecluded the argument that the ERISA fiduciary’s reimburse-\nment claim sought legal damages. See id. at 901. The Eighth\n\f7276               BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nCircuit explained that enforcement of an equitable lien by\nagreement was an equitable remedy rather than a legal one.\nSee id.\n\n   In an effort to distinguish the rulings of five of our sister\ncircuit courts, the majority relies on an out-of-circuit district\ncourt decision, Epolito v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 737\nF. Supp. 2d 1364 (M.D. Fla. 2010). See Majority Opinion, p.\n7265. The district court in Florida acknowledged the Supreme\nCourt’s holding in Sereboff that “strict tracing rules do not\napply to equitable liens by agreement. . . .” Id. at 1380 (quot-\ning Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 364). However, the district court\nstated that it would “not read Sereboff’s holding with respect\nto tracing as broadly” as the circuit courts. Id. I am not per-\nsuaded by the reasoning of the Florida district court. Indeed,\nit appears that the Eleventh Circuit does not agree with the\nreasoning in Epolito. See Popowski v. Parrott, 461 F.3d 1367,\n1374 n.8 (11th Cir. 2006) (“[W]e observe that the Supreme\nCourt in Sereboff . . . clarified that the strict tracing require-\nments that apply to equitable liens . . . do not apply to equita-\nble liens by agreement. . . .”) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Florida district court acknowledged this\nlanguage in the Eleventh Circuit’s decision, but dismissed it\nas dicta. See Epolito, 737 F. Supp. 2d at 1381 n.8.\n\n   The Florida district court also gave extremely short shrift\nto the Eleventh Circuit decision in Admin. Comm. for the Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. Assocs.’ Health & Welfare Plan v. Horton,\n513 F.3d 1223, 1227 & n.4 (11th Cir. 2008) (concluding that\nthe ERISA Plan’s action to recover overpayment from a third-\nparty was equitable in nature).\n\n   The majority opinion seeks to bolster the district court’s\nruling in Epolito by reference to Great-West Life & Annuity\nIns. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204 (2002). See Majority Opin-\nion, pp. 7265-66. However, the First Circuit convincingly dis-\ntinguished Knudson, noting that in Knudson, the funds in\nquestion were never actually in the possession of the ERISA\n\f                   BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                  7277\nbeneficiaries. See Cusson, 592 F.3d at 230; see also Sereboff,\n547 U.S. at 365-66 (distinguishing Knudson). The First Cir-\ncuit persuasively explained that Sereboff is the governing pre-\ncedent when the funds in question are controlled by the\nERISA beneficiary. See id.\n\n   The majority’s reliance on general language in Amschwand\nv. Spherion Corp., 505 F.3d 342, 346 (5th Cir. 2007) regard-\ning the general principles of equity does not in any way dilute\nthe force of the five circuit courts that have interpreted Sereb-\noff as not imposing a tracing requirement on funds being\nsought pursuant to an equitable agreement. This tracing dis-\ncussion from Sereboff was totally ignored by the Fifth Circuit.\n\n   The main problem with the majority’s reliance on CIGNA\nCorp. v. Amara, 131 S. Ct. 1866 (2011), a recent case from\nthe United States Supreme Court, is that the cited language is\npart of the preliminary discussion from the Court prior to its\nanalysis of the actual issues presented. See id. at 1879\n(“[T]raditionally speaking, relief that sought a lien or a con-\nstructive trust was legal relief, not equitable relief, unless the\nfunds in question were particular funds or property in the\ndefendant’s possession.”) (citation omitted) (emphasis in the\noriginal). The Court then went on to discuss the imposition of\nan injunction against the ERISA Plan Administrator, with no\nmention of the tracing issue. See id. at 1879-80.\n\n   Another problem with the majority’s reliance on Amara is\nthat the quoted language is entirely consistent with the analy-\nsis in Sereboff. See 547 U.S. at 364-65 (noting that the com-\nmon law requirement of tracing property to “some particular\nfunds or assets” applied to an equitable lien by restitution but\nnot to an equitable lien by agreement) (citation omitted).\n\n   The final problem with the majority’s reliance on Amara is\nthat it never mentions, let alone purports to overrule, the anal-\nysis in Sereboff. Indeed, because Sereboff specifically\n\f7278               BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\naddresses the issue presented to us, it is the more applicable\nSupreme Court precedent.\n\n   The majority opinion also quotes at length from various\ntreatises. See Majority Opinion, pp. 7266-67. However, it is\nwell-established that treatises are a compilation of general\nprinciples of law, rather than concrete application of princi-\nples of law to a defined set of facts. See Hart v. Massanari,\n266 F.3d 1155, 1169-70, 1171-73 (9th Cir. 2001) (explaining\nthat persuasive authority, including treatises, cannot overcome\nthe force of Supreme Court precedent).\n\n   I am also not persuaded by the majority’s citation to Bonne-\nville Power Admin. v. Wash. Pub. Power Supply Sys., 956\nF.2d 1497, 1507 (9th Cir. 1992). See Majority Opinion, p.\n7268-69. That case predates Sereboff by almost fifteen years\nand is inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s reasoning.\nRather than creating an indefensible circuit split, I would\nadhere to the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Sereboff as\ninterpreted by our sister circuits, and conclude that strict trac-\ning of the overpaid funds is not required to enforce an equita-\nble lien by agreement. If the ERISA fiduciary were seeking\nreimbursement in the absence of an agreement to reimburse\nany overpayment, I would agree with the majority opinion\nthat application of the holding in Knudson would be appropri-\nate. However, where the ERISA beneficiary expressly agrees\nto reimburse the Plan for any benefit overpayment, as in this\ncase, enforcement of the resulting equitable lien by agreement\nconstitutes an equitable remedy rather than a legal one, and\nSereboff controls. See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 368 (recognizing\nthe distinction between an equitable lien premised on restitu-\ntion principles and an equitable lien premised on an agree-\nment). The district court’s decision in this case properly\napplied Sereboff and its judgment should be affirmed in its\nentirety.\n\f",

Bilyeu appeals the district court’s dismissal of her\nclaim challenging the termination of her long-term disability\nbenefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act\nof 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. § 1132. Bilyeu also challenges\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of\nFirst Unum Life Insurance Company (Unum) on Unum’s\ncounterclaim for restitution of overpaid benefits. We have\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we vacate and\nremand.\n\n   We vacate the judgment in favor of Unum on Bilyeu’s\nclaim for denial of benefits. We hold that the district court\nabused its discretion by dismissing this claim for failure to\nexhaust administrative remedies. The exhaustion requirement\nshould have been excused because Bilyeu acted reasonably in\nlight of Unum’s ambiguous communications and failure to\nengage in a meaningful dialogue.\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                7249\n   We also vacate the judgment in favor of Unum on Unum’s\ncounterclaim for reimbursement of overpaid long-term dis-\nability benefits. Unum has not shown that it is seeking equita-\nble relief because it has not satisfied the elements for an\nequitable lien by agreement, which is the only form of equita-\nble relief Unum has asserted. These elements are not satisfied\nbecause the particular fund subject to the lien, having been\ndissipated, is no longer in Bilyeu’s possession. Unum thus\nseeks only the imposition of personal liability against Bilyeu,\nto be paid out of her general assets. That is quintessentially\nlegal, rather than equitable, relief.\n\n                    I.   BACKGROUND\n\n   Bilyeu was employed by Discover Financial Services from\n1987 through April 2004. Compl. ¶ 8. Morgan Stanley Long-\nTerm Disability Plan (the Plan) provides benefits for long-\nterm disabilities to Discover employees. Id. ¶¶ 4-5. Unum is\nthe Plan’s claim administrator, and also the insurer and payor\nof Plan benefits. Id. ¶¶ 6-7.\n\n   Alleging she suffered from several medical conditions that\nprevented her from materially performing the duties of any\noccupation, Bilyeu filed a long-term disability (LTD) claim\nwith Unum in April 2004. Id. ¶¶ 9-10. These conditions\nincluded Behçet’s disease, fatigue and anxiety. Id. ¶¶ 12-18;\nClerk’s Record 13-2 at 3. Unum approved the claim in Octo-\nber 2004. Compl. ¶ 11. Under the Plan, benefits for disabili-\nties arising from mental illness are limited to 24 months. Id.\n¶ 19. Unum concluded that Bilyeu’s disability was subject to\nthe mental illness limitation. Id. Bilyeu disputed that conclu-\nsion. Id. ¶¶ 12-20.\n\n  Nearing the 24-month deadline, Dr. Sharon Hogan, a medi-\ncal consultant for Unum, called Bilyeu’s treating physician,\nDr. Kenneth Proefrock, to discuss her medical condition.\nClerk’s Record 15.1 at 5-7. On December 6, 2006, Dr. Hogan\nsent a summary of the conversation to Dr. Proefrock, asking\n\f7250              BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nhim to respond within 10 business days if he believed the let-\nter inaccurately summarized their conversation. Id. at 6. The\nletter reflected disagreement between Dr. Hogan and Dr.\nProefrock regarding the nature of Bilyeu’s limitations. Dr.\nHogan believed “Bilyeu’s fatigue in large part arises from her\nanxiety and depression, since her Behçet’s is not very active.”\nId. at 6. It was Dr. Proefrock’s opinion, however, “that her\nfatigue is mainly physical.” Id. Dr. Hogan also believed that\nBilyeu “should have full-time sedentary work capacity,” an\nassessment with which Dr. Proefrock disagreed. Id. at 5;\nClerk’s Record 13-2 at 3.\n\n   On December 27, 2006, Unum sent Bilyeu a termination of\nbenefits letter. Clerk’s Record 13-2. Unum terminated bene-\nfits under the Plan provision limiting disability benefits due to\nmental illness to 24 months. Id. at 3. The letter reported that,\nalthough “fatigue can result from Behcet’s, . . . your anxiety\nand depression are the more likely causes of your fatigue.” Id.\nIt said, “because your claim is subject to a 24 month mental\n[illness] limitation and we have now provided 24 months of\nbenefits, we will stop paying benefits on your claim as of\nDecember 03, 2006 and your claim will be closed at this\ntime.” Id. at 4. The letter also recorded Unum’s conclusion\nthat “you have full time sedentary work capacity” and thus\n“no longer meet the definition of disability from a physical\nperspective.” Id. The letter noted Dr. Proefrock’s contrary\ndetermination that Bilyeu was unable to return to work.

The “address noted on this letterhead” was:\n\n     First Unum Life Insurance Company\n     The Benefits Center\n     PO Box 100158\n     Columbia, SC 29202-3158\n     Phone: 1-800-858-8843\n     Fax: 1-800-447-2498\n     www.unumprovident.com\n\nId. at 1.\n\n   After receiving Unum’s termination of benefits letter,\nBilyeu asked Dr. Proefrock to respond to the letter. Compl. ¶\n22. Dr. Proefrock did so, writing a letter to Unum on April 19,\n2007. Id. ¶ 23. Dr. Proefrock’s letter was addressed “To\nWhom It May Concern” and, it appears, faxed to 1-800-447-\n2498 — the number listed in the letterhead of Unum’s\nDecember 27, 2006 termination of benefits letter as the place\nto send “additional information to support your request for\ndisability benefits.” Clerk’s Record 15-1 at 2-4.\n\n   Unum construed Dr. Proefrock’s letter as “new informa-\ntion,” but concluded that it did not “change [the] prior deci-\nsion” to terminate benefits. Id. at 9. Unum, however, never\ncommunicated this conclusion to Bilyeu or, for that matter,\ncontacted Bilyeu or Dr. Proefrock at all in response to the let-\nter. Compl. ¶ 27.\n\n   In November 2008, Bilyeu filed a complaint against Unum,\nalleging that Unum wrongfully terminated benefits under the\n24-month mental illness limitation because “[t]he substantial\nweight of the medical opinion contained in the claim file rea-\nsonably supports a finding that [her] disability is not due to\n‘mental illness,’ rather, it is due to an autoimmune condition\n\f7252              BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nwhich was exacerbated by anxiety and mental/emotional\nstressors in [her] life.” Id. ¶ 20. The complaint sought a rein-\nstatement of benefits under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). Id. at\n¶ 44.\n\n   Unum filed an answer and a counterclaim. In its counter-\nclaim, Unum sought reimbursement of overpaid long-term\ndisability benefits. Unum alleged that it had paid Bilyeu LTD\nbenefits subject to her promise to reimburse Unum for any\noverpayment arising from her receipt of disability benefits\nfrom any other source, including social security disability\nbenefits. Answer and Counterclaim ¶¶ 5-10. Bilyeu subse-\nquently received an award of social security benefits, result-\ning in an overpayment of LTD benefits in the amount of\n$36,597.82. Id. ¶¶ 11-12. Unum’s counterclaim sought to\nrecover the overpayment from Bilyeu. Specifically, Unum\nasserted a claim for equitable relief under ERISA, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1132(a)(3), as well as a claim for breach of contract. Id. at\n7-8.\n\n   Unum then moved to dismiss Bilyeu’s denial-of-benefits\nclaim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Clerk’s\nRecord 13. In that motion, Unum contended that the Decem-\nber 2006 termination of benefits letter required Bilyeu to file\na written appeal within 180 days, which she failed to do. Id.\nUnum thus sought dismissal of Bilyeu’s claim. The district\ncourt granted the motion, concluding that Bilyeu failed to\nexhaust administrative remedies and dismissing Bilyeu’s\nclaim with prejudice. Clerk’s Record 21 at 7.\n\n   Unum then filed a motion for summary judgment on its\ncounterclaim for reimbursement of overpaid benefits. Clerk’s\nRecord 28. Unum argued that it was entitled to relief under\nERISA because it “has an equitable lien by agreement over\nthe long-term disability benefits that it overpaid to Bilyeu.”\nId. at 1. Bilyeu opposed the motion, arguing that Unum could\nnot satisfy the requirements for an equitable lien by agree-\nment because it could not establish that the overpaid LTD\n\f                    BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY               7253\nbenefits remained in her possession. Clerk’s Record 30 at 2.\nThe parties stipulated that, by the time Bilyeu was awarded\nsocial security benefits, “she had dissipated at least a portion\nof her LTD benefits.” Joint Statement of Facts ¶ 15. The dis-\ntrict court granted Unum’s motion, and it directed the clerk of\ncourt “to enter judgment in the amount of $36,597.82 in favor\nof [Unum].” Clerk’s Record 32 at 6.\n\n  The court entered judgment and Bilyeu timely appealed.\nClerk’s Record 33, 35.\n\n              II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n   The district court dismissed Bilyeu’s denial-of-benefits\nclaim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-\ndure. Both parties, however, have relied on matters outside\nthe pleadings. Consistent with circuit practice addressing\nexhaustion, we construe Unum’s motion as an unenumerated\nmotion to dismiss. In addressing that motion, a court may\nlook beyond the pleadings and decide disputed issues of fact.\nSee Payne v. Peninsula Sch.

MORGAN STANLEY\n   [1] “ERISA itself does not require a participant or benefi-\nciary to exhaust administrative remedies in order to bring an\naction under § 502 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1132.” Vaught v.\nScottsdale Healthcare Corp.

Thus, “[a]s a general rule, an\nERISA claimant must exhaust available administrative reme-\ndies before bringing a claim in federal court.” Barboza, 651\nF.3d at 1076. “However, when an employee benefits plan fails\nto establish or follow ‘reasonable claims procedures’ consis-\ntent with the requirements of ERISA, a claimant need not\nexhaust because his claims will be deemed exhausted.” Id.\n(quoting 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(l)). ERISA, moreover,\nrequires “a meaningful dialogue between ERISA plan admin-\nistrators and their beneficiaries.” Booton v. Lockheed Med.\nBenefit Plan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739348\"><a href=\"/opinion/739348/marjorie-booton-v-lockheed-medical-benefit-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1463 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n   [2] Here, Unum’s December 27, 2006 termination of bene-\nfits letter advised Bilyeu of two courses of action, either of\nwhich she was required to undertake within 180 days: (a) pro-\nviding “additional information to support your request for dis-\nability benefits” or (b) “if you disagree with our determination\nand want to appeal this claim decision, you must submit a\nwritten appeal.” After receiving Unum’s letter, Bilyeu asked\nher treating physician, Dr. Proefrock, to respond, and he did\nso, writing a letter to Unum on April 19, 2007 — well within\nthe 180-day window required in Unum’s letter. Dr. Proefrock\naddressed his letter “To Whom It May Concern” and faxed it\nto 1-800-447-2498 — the number listed in the letterhead of\nUnum’s December 27, 2006 termination of benefits letter as\nthe place to send “additional information to support your\nrequest for disability benefits.”\n\n   Unum construed Dr. Proefrock’s letter as “new informa-\ntion,” but concluded that it did not “change [the] prior deci-\nsion” to terminate benefits. Unum, however, never\ncommunicated this conclusion to Bilyeu or, for that matter,\ncontacted Bilyeu or Dr. Proefrock at all in response to the let-\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                 7255\nter. Meanwhile, according to Unum, Bilyeu’s deadline to\nappeal expired sometime after June 25, 2007, 180 days after\nthe termination of benefits letter.\n\n   Under the circumstances of this case, exhaustion must be\nexcused. Bilyeu contends that she read the termination of ben-\nefits letter as presenting two options — she could either (a)\nsubmit additional information or (b) file a written appeal. The\nletter was ambiguous, so Bilyeu’s reading was not unreason-\nable. On the contrary, given that it would have made no sense\nto appeal the adverse benefits decision while simultaneously\nsubmitting additional medical information from her physician,\nas she was invited to do by Unum, her reading of the letter\nwas entirely appropriate.\n\n   We recognize that the letter is also susceptible to the read-\ning proffered by Unum — that Bilyeu was required to file an\nappeal within 180 days even if she submitted additional medi-\ncal information. But the letter could have been, and should\nhave been, much clearer on this point. Bilyeu was not repre-\nsented by counsel and, we presume, had no legal training. She\nshould not be saddled with a loss of her legal rights because\nshe misconstrued a confusingly worded communication from\nher plan’s claims administrator. Cf. Saffon v. Wells Fargo &\nCo.

A communication from a claims\nadministrator to a plan participant should clearly apprise her\nof her rights and obligations under the plan. Unum’s letter did\nnot do so. Nor did Bilyeu receive timely notice that Unum\n\f7256                 BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nconsidered her reading of the letter to be wrong, because\nUnum never responded to Dr. Proefrock’s timely letter.1\n\n   We hold that the district court abused its discretion by bar-\nring Bilyeu’s claim.\n\n              IV.    UNUM’S COUNTERCLAIM\n\nA.     Bilyeu Waived Her Argument That Unum Lacks\n       Statutory Standing as a Fiduciary\n\n   Bilyeu argues for the first time on appeal that Unum lacks\nstanding to seek equitable restitution under ERISA because\nUnum is not a plan “fiduciary.” This is a challenge to Unum’s\nstatutory standing.

By failing to raise this argu-\nment before the district court, Bilyeu thus waived her chal-\nlenge to Unum’s standing as a fiduciary under ERISA.\n\nB.   The District Court Improperly Awarded Legal Relief\n\n   Unum paid Bilyeu long-term disability benefits pursuant to\nBilyeu’s agreement to reimburse Unum “any overpayment\nresulting from my receipt of benefits from other sources.”\nJoint Statement of Facts ¶ 12. The agreement stated in perti-\nnent part:\n\n     Please pay me the disability benefit with no reduc-\n     tion for amounts received by other sources until a\n     final determination of my eligibility to receive those\n     benefits is made. I understand that this may result in\n     an overpayment by the Insurer. I agree to notify the\n     Insurer within 48 hours of receiving notice of any\n     and all decisions, to supply the Insurer with a copy\n     of the final decision, and to repay any overpayment\n     incurred as a result of receiving any other benefits\n     from those sources specified in the policy. . . .\n\n     By selecting [this] Option . . . , I understand that the\n     Insurer has agreed to pay me an unreduced benefit\n     based upon my written promise herein to pay the\n     Insurer any overpayment resulting from my receipt\n     of benefits from other sources, as outlined in my pol-\n     icy. I agree to reimburse the Insurer any such over-\n     payment within thirty (30) days of my receipt of\n     such funds.\n\n     If I fail to pay the Insurer the overpayment within the\n     thirty (30) day period specified above, I understand\n     that the Insurer may reduce future payments under\n     the policy in order to recover the overpaid benefits.\n\f7258                 BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\n      I also understand that I shall be liable to the Insurer\n      for the full amount of any such overpayment, plus\n      applicable statutory interest, and for all reasonable\n      costs (including attorney’s fees) of collection of the\n      overpaid benefits.\n\nId. Bilyeu subsequently received social security disability\nbenefits, but did not reimburse Unum. Id. ¶¶ 16-19. Unum\nfiled a counterclaim for reimbursement of the overpaid bene-\nfits.\n\n   [3] Ordinarily, a contracting party in Unum’s position\nwould file a claim for breach of contract and seek relief in the\nform of a judgment for money damages.2 Under ERISA, how-\never, a plan fiduciary such as Unum can seek only “equitable\nrelief” from a plan participant such as Bilyeu. 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1132(a)(3)(B). Section 1132(a) provides:\n\n      A civil action may be brought . . . (3) by a partici-\n      pant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act\n      or practice which violates any provision of this sub-\n      chapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain\n      other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such\n      violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this\n      subchapter or the terms of the plan.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1132(a) (emphasis added). Unum therefore can-\nnot sue for damages under ERISA; it must show that it is\nseeking equitable relief.\n\n  Unum contends it has made this showing because it is seek-\n  2\n   Unum has, in fact, asserted a state-law claim for breach of contract.\nClerk’s Record 5 at 7-8 (Answer and Counterclaim); Clerk’s Record 28\nat 8 (motion for summary judgment). Bilyeu contends Unum has aban-\ndoned that claim and that, in any event, the claim is preempted by ERISA.\nClerk’s Record 30 at 9. Unum’s contract claim has not been adjudicated,\nand we express no opinion as to its merits.\n\f                        BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                         7259\ning an equitable lien by agreement. Clerk’s Record 28 at 1, 6-\n7; Answering Brief at 36. The Supreme Court has recognized\nan equitable lien by agreement as a form of “equitable relief”\nauthorized by § 1132(a)(3)(B). See Sereboff v. Mid Atl. Med.\nServs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145657\"><a href=\"/opinion/145657/sereboff-v-mid-atlantic-medical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364-65 (2006).3 The only question,\ntherefore, is whether Unum has satisfied the requirements for\nan equitable lien by agreement in this case. We begin by sum-\nmarizing Sereboff.\n\n   The Sereboffs were beneficiaries of a health insurance plan\ngoverned by ERISA and administered by Mid Atlantic. See\nid. at 359. The plan provided for payment of covered medical\nexpenses, subject to an “Acts of Third Parties” provision\nrequiring a beneficiary to reimburse Mid Atlantic in the event\nof recovery from a third-party tortfeasor. See id. This provi-\nsion applied when a beneficiary was sick or injured as a result\nof the act or omission of another person or party, and required\na beneficiary who received benefits under the plan for such\ninjuries to reimburse Mid Atlantic for those benefits from all\nrecoveries from a third party, whether by lawsuit, settlement\n  3\n  An equitable lien by agreement is a traditional form of equitable relief.\nAccording to Pomeroy’s Treatise on Equity,\n      The doctrine may be stated in its most general form, that every\n      express executory agreement in writing, whereby the contracting\n      party sufficiently indicates an intention to make some particular\n      property, real or personal, or fund, therein described or identified,\n      a security for a debt or other obligation, or whereby the party\n      promises to convey or assign or transfer the property as security,\n      creates an equitable lien upon the property so indicated, which is\n      enforceable against the property in the hands not only of the orig-\n      inal contractor, but of his heirs, administrators, executors, volun-\n      tary assignees, and purchasers or encumbrancers with notice.\n      Under like circumstances, a merely verbal agreement may create\n      a similar lien upon personal property.\n4 John Norton Pomeroy, A Treatise on Equity § 1235, p. 696 (5th ed.\n1941); see also Restatement (Third) of Restitution § 56 cmt. d (2011)\n(“[T]he failure to transfer a promised share of an identifiable fund may\njustify specific relief to the claimant, frequently accomplished via equita-\nble lien.”).\n\f7260               BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nor otherwise. See id. After the Sereboffs were injured in an\nautomobile accident and the plan paid their medical expenses,\nthe Sereboffs recovered a tort settlement from third parties.\nSee id. at 360. Mid Atlantic filed suit under ERISA seeking\nto recover their medical payments from the Sereboffs’ tort\nrecovery. See id. The Sereboffs agreed to set aside from the\ntort recovery a sum equal to the amount Mid Atlantic claimed,\nand to preserve that sum in a segregated investment account\npending the outcome of the suit. See id.\n\n   The Supreme Court held that Mid Atlantic could enforce\nthe terms of the Acts of Third Parties provision through an\nequitable lien by agreement — “the familiar rul[e] of equity\nthat a contract to convey a specific object even before it is\nacquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets\na title to the thing.” Id. at 363-64 (alteration in original) (quot-\ning Barnes v. Alexander, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98064\"><a href=\"/opinion/98064/barnes-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121 (1914)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Sereboff’s promise to reimburse\nMid Atlantic from any recovery from a third party created a\nlien upon that recovery as soon as it was created. See id. at\n364. Mid Atlantic was allowed to follow a portion of the tort\nrecovery into the Sereboffs’ hands, and to impose upon that\nportion an equitable lien. See id.\n\n   The Court also made clear that, to satisfy the requirements\nfor an equitable lien by agreement, Mid Atlantic was not\nrequired to trace the funds in the Sereboffs’ tort recovery back\nto Mid Atlantic’s own possession.

That question was beside the point, because Mid Atlantic\nwas seeking an equitable lien by agreement, not equitable res-\ntitution. With regard to an equitable lien by agreement, the\nCourt held that “no tracing requirement of the sort asserted by\nthe Sereboffs applies.” Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 365 (emphasis\nadded).

First, there must be a promise by the\nbeneficiary to reimburse the fiduciary for benefits paid under\nthe plan in the event of a recovery from a third party. Second,\nthe reimbursement agreement must “specifically identif[y] a\nparticular fund, distinct from the [beneficiary’s] general\nassets,” from which the fiduciary will be reimbursed. Id. at\n364. Third, the funds specifically identified by the fiduciary\nmust be “within the possession and control of the [benefi-\nciary].” Id. at 363.\n\n   1. Here, the first criterion is clearly satisfied. Bilyeu does\nnot dispute that she promised to reimburse Unum for an over-\npayment of long-term disability benefits arising from her\nreceipt of benefits from other sources, including social secur-\nity disability benefits.\n\f7262               BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\n   2. It is less clear whether the second criterion is satisfied.\nUnum contends that the reimbursement agreement specifi-\ncally identified the overpaid long-term disability benefits as\nthe particular fund, distinct from Bilyeu’s general assets, from\nwhich it is to be reimbursed. In Unum’s view, once Bilyeu\nreceived her social security disability benefits, the specifically\nidentified fund — the overpaid long-term disability benefits\n— came into existence, and Unum was allowed to impose a\nlien against that fund. This argument is plausible, but prob-\nlematic. Unlike the third party tort recovery in Sereboff and\nthe contingency fee in Barnes, the overpaid disability benefits\nare not a particular fund, but a specific amount of money\nencompassed within a particular fund — the long-term dis-\nability benefits Unum paid to Bilyeu. As an amount of money,\nthe overpayment is specific. As property or as a fund, how-\never, the overpayment is lacking in specificity because it is an\nundifferentiated component of a larger fund. The overpay-\nment has never existed as a distinct object or fund. See 53\nC.J.S. Liens § 19 (2012) (“In order that an equitable lien may\narise by contract, the agreement of the parties must deal with\nsome specific property, and it is also essential that the prop-\nerty or fund intended to be appropriated or charged should be\nidentified or described with a reasonable degree of certainty.”\n(emphasis added) (footnote omitted)); 4 John Norton\nPomeroy, A Treatise on Equity § 1235, p. 696 (5th ed. 1941)\n(explaining that an equitable lien applies to “some particular\nproperty, real or personal, or fund, therein described or identi-\nfied” (emphasis added)); Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 364 (holding\nthat the requirements for an equitable lien by agreement were\nsatisfied because the “plan specifically identified a particular\nfund” (emphasis added)); Barnes, 232 U.S. at 121 (holding\nthat “a contract to convey a specific object even before it is\nacquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets\na title to the thing” (emphasis added)).\n\n   Unum’s reimbursement agreement would have avoided\nthese problems if, consistent with Sereboff, it had identified\nthe third party recovery — here, Bilyeu’s social security dis-\n\f                        BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                         7263\nability benefits — as the particular fund enlisted to serve as\nsecurity for the overpayment of benefits. Of course, that\nwould not have worked in this case: Under the Social Security\nAct, Bilyeu could not assign her social security benefits, and\nUnum could not attach them. See 42 U.S.C. § 407(a).4 “The\npurpose of the exemption created by Congress in 42 U.S.C.\n§ 407 is to protect social security beneficiaries from creditors’\nclaims.” Dionne v.

By identifying the overpaid benefits as the particular\nfund, rather than the social security benefits, Unum attempts\nto circumvent the congressional prohibition on assignment\nand attachment of social security benefits.\n\n   [5] 3. Even assuming that Unum could satisfy the second\ncriterion, Unum has not satisfied the third criterion — the\nrequirement that the specifically identified fund be within\nBilyeu’s “possession and control.” Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 363.\nIn Sereboff, Mid Atlantic sought to recover specifically identi-\nfied funds that were “within the possession and control of the\nSereboffs, . . . set aside and preserved in the Sereboffs’ invest-\nment accounts.” Id. (alteration and internal quotation marks\nomitted). That the funds were extant, and in the Sereboffs’\npossession, was essential to the Court’s holding that Mid\nAtlantic was seeking equitable, rather than legal, relief. See\nid. at 362-63.\n\n   Here, by contrast, Bilyeu asserts, and Unum has not\nrefuted, that Bilyeu has spent the overpaid benefits.5 Unum,\n  4\n   Section 407 states:\n      The right of any person to any future payment under this sub-\n      chapter shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity,\n      and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under\n      this subchapter shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment,\n      garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any\n      bankruptcy or insolvency law.\n42 U.S.C. § 407(a).\n  5\n    The burden to show that the overpaid benefits remain in Bilyeu’s pos-\nsession presumably falls on Unum. See Restatement (First) of Restitution\n\f7264                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\ntherefore, is not seeking to recover a specified fund that is\npreserved and in Bilyeu’s possession. Instead, Unum is seek-\ning a judgment requiring Bilyeu to pay money out of her gen-\neral assets. In Sereboff’s words, Unum is seeking “the\nimposition of personal liability,” rather than enforcement of\nan “equitable lien on particular property.” Id. at 362 (quoting\nKnudson, 534 U.S. at 214) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThis is quintessentially legal, rather than equitable, relief.

MORGAN STANLEY\nIn Knudson, the Court said, “where the property sought to be\nrecovered or its proceeds have been dissipated so that no\nproduct remains, the plaintiff’s claim is only that of a general\ncreditor, and the plaintiff cannot enforce a constructive trust\nof or an equitable lien upon other property of the defendant.”\n534 U.S. at 213-14 (alterations and internal quotation marks\nomitted) (quoting Restatement (First) of Restitution § 215\ncmt. a, p. 867 (1936)). In Amara, decided just last Term, the\nCourt once again underscored that, “traditionally speaking,\nrelief that sought a lien or a constructive trust was legal relief,\nnot equitable relief, unless the funds in question were ‘partic-\nular funds or property in the defendant’s possession.’ ” 131 S.\nCt. at 1879 (second emphasis added) (quoting Knudson, 534\nU.S. at 213). Here, Unum has arguably identified a particular\nfund — the overpaid benefits — but that fund is no longer in\nBilyeu’s possession.\n\n   Unum’s argument that an equitable lien can be enforced\nagainst general assets when the specifically identified prop-\nerty has been dissipated finds no support in the traditional\ndoctrine governing equitable liens by agreement. See 4\nPomeroy, A Treatise on Equity § 1235, p. 696 (5th ed. 1941)\n(explaining that an equitable lien may be enforced when the\nspecifically identified property is in the hands of the contrac-\ntor — or in the hands of a subsequent possessor with notice\nof the lien, a qualification not relevant to Bilyeu’s case). If the\nproperty or fund subject to the lien (or proceeds to which the\nproperty or fund can be traced), are no longer in the defen-\ndant’s possession, then there is no res against which the equi-\ntable lien can be enforced. See 53 C.J.S. Liens § 46 (2012)\n(“[A] lien that is not satisfied voluntarily may be enforced by\nan action to foreclose, in which a court may order the property\nsecuring the debt or obligation to be sold and its proceeds\napplied on the demand of the creditor in whose favor the lien\nexists.” (footnote omitted)); Restatement (First) of Restitution\n§ 161 cmt. e (1937) (“An equitable lien can be established and\nenforced only if there is some property which is subject to the\nlien. Where property is subject to an equitable lien and the\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                  7267\nowner of the property disposes of it and acquires other prop-\nerty in exchange, he holds the property so acquired subject to\nthe lien . . . . So also, where the property which is subject to\nthe lien is mingled with other property in one indistinguish-\nable mass, the lien can be enforced against the mingled mass\n. . . . Where, however, the property subject to the equitable\nlien can no longer be traced, the equitable lien cannot be\nenforced . . . .” (emphasis added)); id. § 215(1) (“[W]here a\nperson wrongfully disposes of the property of another but the\nproperty cannot be traced into any product, the other has\nmerely a personal claim against the wrongdoer and cannot\nenforce a constructive trust or lien upon any part of the\nwrongdoer’s property.”); id. § 215 cmt. a (“[I]f it is shown\nthat the property or its proceeds have been dissipated so that\nno product remains, . . . the claimant cannot enforce . . . an\nequitable lien upon other property of the wrongdoer, and has\nonly a personal claim against the wrongdoer.”); Restatement\n(Third) of Restitution § 58 cmt. c (2011) (“To obtain a prop-\nerty interest in something other than the original asset, and not\nmerely restitution of its value in money, the claimant must\nnormally show that the property claimed is the traceable prod-\nuct of the original asset.”); id. § 60(3) (“A claimant who is\nentitled to restitution but who is unable to identify specific\nproperty from which restitution is available has a remedy via\nmoney judgment that ranks equally with the claims of general\ncreditors.”).\n\n   In sum, although the district court’s decision may have pro-\nduced an equitable result, the court erred because Unum has\nnot shown that it is seeking equitable relief. We remand,\naffording Unum the opportunity to establish that it has identi-\nfied a particular fund (the second criterion) and that the over-\npaid long-term disability benefits, or assets to which the\noverpaid benefits can be traced, remain in Bilyeu’s possession\n(the third criterion). See 53 C.J.S. Liens § 24 (2012) (“An\nequitable lien for advances may exist where advancements of\nmoney or funds are made on the faith of certain property, real\nor personal, under an agreement or circumstances showing\n\f7268                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nthat it was the intention of the parties to pledge such property\nas security for the advancements, provided the specific prop-\nerty or its proceeds on which the advancements were invested\ncan be traced or identified.” (emphasis added) (footnote omit-\nted)); 2 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies § 6.1(4) (2d ed.\n1993) (discussing enforcement of an equitable lien in the case\nof commingled funds).6\n\n   There is much to be said for maintaining uniformity among\nthe federal circuits, and we should strive to do so when we\ncan.

ERISA, however, provides\nonly for “equitable relief,” 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)(B), and\nUnum has not shown that the relief granted here — “judgment\nin the amount of $36,597.82 in favor of First Unum Life\nInsurance Company,” to be paid out of Bilyeu’s general assets\n— falls into that category. The district court did not identify\na particular fund and impose upon it an equitable lien. Instead,\nthe district court’s order reads like a money judgment, which\nis what it is. As we explained in Bonneville Power Adminis-\ntration v. Washington Public Power Supply System, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578190\"><a href=\"/opinion/578190/bonneville-power-administration-v-washington-public-power-supply-system-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1992),\n  6\n    The kind of tracing we discuss here is distinct from the theory of trac-\ning rejected in Sereboff. The issue in Sereboff was whether a plaintiff is\nrequired to trace the specific property or particular fund back to the plain-\ntiff’s own possession. Sereboff makes clear that that sort of tracing is not\nrequired for an equitable lien by agreement. See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 364-\n65. The kind of tracing we refer to here simply allows a plaintiff to trace\nthe specific property or a particular fund when the defendant has either\ncommingled it with the defendant’s other assets or exchanged it for other\nproperty See 53 C.J.S. Liens § 29 (2012) (“[W]here the owner of property\nsubject to a lien commingles it with other property alike in quality and\nvalue, the lien is not extinguished so long as there is on hand sufficient\nproperty alike in quality and value to satisfy the lien.”); id. § 49 (“If the\nproperty on which an equitable lien is held has been sold before foreclo-\nsure, the court can trace the funds from the sale and impress a lien upon\nany property acquired with the proceeds.”); Restatement (Third) of Resti-\ntution §§ 58-59 (2011) (describing tracing principles as applied to equita-\nble liens and constructive trusts).\n\f                     BILYEU v.

Therefore\n      the court erred in granting . . . a lien on funds.\n\nId. at 1507 (citation omitted) (quoting Restatement (First) of\nRestitution § 161 cmt. e (1937)).7 We are bound to adhere to\nthat principle today.\n\n                        V.    CONCLUSION\n\n   The district court abused its discretion by dismissing\nBilyeu’s denial-of-benefits claim for a failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies. The court also erred when it con-\ncluded that Unum had satisfied the requirements for an equi-\ntable lien by agreement. The judgment of the district court is\ntherefore vacated and the case is remanded for further pro-\nceedings.\n\n  VACATED AND REMANDED. Costs of appeal are\nawarded to Bilyeu.\n\n\n\n\n  7\n    We recognize that “the fact that . . . relief takes the form of a money\npayment does not [necessarily] remove it from the category of tradition-\nally equitable relief.” Amara, 131 S. Ct. at 1880. Here, however, Unum\nhas not advanced a specific theory under which the money judgment\nagainst Bilyeu falls within a traditional form of equitable relief. Whether\nsome form of equitable relief might be available here, as well as whether\nUnum could reformulate its reimbursement agreement to resolve the prob-\nlems presented here, are thus questions beyond the scope of this appeal.\n\f7270               BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nRAWLINSON, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part:\n\n  I agree with the majority that Plaintiff Leah Bilyeu (Bilyeu)\nwaived her argument that Unum Life Insurance Company\n(Unum) lacks statutory standing. I respectfully disagree on all\nother issues.\n\n   Bilyeu argues on appeal, as she did before the district court,\nthat a fax sent by her physician Dr. Proefrock to Dr. Hogan,\nthe physician for Unum, satisfied the exhaustion requirement\nunder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n(ERISA). However, the letter denying Bilyeu’s claim explic-\nitly directed her that if she disagreed with the determination\ndenying disability benefits, she was required to submit an\nappeal in writing to: First Unum Life Insurance Company at\nPO Box 100158, Columbia, SC 29202-3158, Fax: 1-800-447-\n2498 www.unumprovident.com.\n\n   Rather than submitting an appeal as directed, Bilyeu\nelected to provide additional information pursuant to a differ-\nent paragraph of the denial letter. This information was sent\nto Unum’s physician advisor rather than to the benefits center\nas directed in the denial letter from Unum.\n\n   The district court found that because the letter from\nBilyeu’s physician to Unum’s physician did not comply with\nthe appeal procedure, Bilyeu did not exhaust the administra-\ntive remedies available under the ERISA Plan.

See District Court Opin-\nion, p. 6. The district court also noted that the letter from\nBilyeu’s physician was faxed to Unum’s physician advisor\nrather than to Unum, as instructed in the communication from\nUnum to Bilyeu. See id. Because the letter from Bilyeu’s phy-\nsician did not comply with the appeal procedure and did not\nseek administrative review, the district court found that\nBilyeu failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies.\nSee id. The district court specifically ruled that Bilyeu’s sub-\nmission of additional medical information was no substitute\nfor filing an appeal as directed.\n\n   The district court correctly identified and applied governing\nprecedent. As noted in Diaz, 50 F.3d at 1483, “[e]arly in\nERISA’s history,” we established the general rule requiring\nexhaustion of administrative remedies. See also Mack v.\nKuckenmeister, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"151319\"><a href=\"/opinion/151319/mack-v-kuckenmeister/\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1020 (9th Cir. 2010). We con-\ncluded that exhaustion of administrative remedies is war-\nranted because exhaustion is consistent with the legislative\nstructure of ERISA. We also reasoned that the exhaustion\nrequirement advances “important policy considerations,\nincluding the reduction of frivolous litigation, the promotion\nof consistent treatment of claims, the provision of a nonadver-\nsarial method of claims settlement, the minimization of costs\nof claim settlement and a proper reliance on administrative\nexpertise. . . .” Id., citing Amato v. Bernard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"376728\"><a href=\"/opinion/376728/michael-r-amato-v-j-w-bernard-warren-driver-c-v-holder-roy-silver/\"><span class=\"volume\">618</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n566-68 (9th Cir. 1980).\n\n   The district court faithfully adhered to this precedent when\nit precluded Bilyeu’s claim due to her failure to submit an\nappeal to Unum, the benefits administrator. See Diaz, 50 F.3d\nat 1483 (“By not submitting a written appeal to the Benefits\nAdministrator, [the Plaintiff] failed to comply with the Plan’s\n\f7272              BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\ninternal review procedures and hence did not exhaust the\navailable administrative remedies. . . .”); see also Sarraf v.\nStandard Insurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"731276\"><a href=\"/opinion/731276/96-cal-daily-op-serv-8931-96-daily-journal-dar-14963-jalal-sarraf/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 993 (9th Cir. 1996)\n(“Under Diaz, [Plaintiff’s] failure to request in writing review\nof the Administrator’s adverse decision precludes the instant\nclaims under the ERISA plan.”), citing Diaz, 50 F.3d at 1483.\n\n   Because the district court followed well-established prece-\ndent in requiring exhaustion of the prescribed administrative\nremedy, the majority understandably refrains from holding\nthat the district court abused its discretion by applying an\nincorrect legal rule. Rather, the majority excuses Bilyeu’s lack\nof exhaustion by attributing to Unum a purported failure “to\nestablish or follow reasonable claims procedures.” Majority\nOpinion, p. 7254. The majority cites to Barboza v. Cal. Ass’n\nof Prof’l Firefighters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"220106\"><a href=\"/opinion/220106/barboza-v-cal-assn-of-professional-firefighters/\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2011) as sup-\nport for its holding. However, that case bears little resem-\nblance to this case and is not controlling or compelling. In\nBarboza, the ERISA beneficiary did not receive a timely\ndetermination of the Plan’s decision. See Barboza, 651 F.3d\nat 1078. No similar allegation was made in this case. In Bar-\nboza, the issue was whether the Plan provisions complied\nwith ERISA regulations. See id. at 1077. No similar issue\nexists in this case. In Barboza we deferred to the interpreta-\ntion of the Secretary of Labor regarding the proper resolution\nof “conflicting interpretations” of an ERISA regulation. Id. at\n1079. No interpretation of an ERISA regulation was involved\nin this case. Rather, the district court in this case was called\nupon to decide whether Bilyeu perfected her appeal by send-\ning additional information to the Plan’s physician rather than\nchallenging the denial of benefits by directing an appeal to\nUnum at the address provided.\n\n   The majority concedes that the provisions of the denial let-\nter sent to Bilyeu were susceptible to the reading argued by\nUnum as well as the reading urged by Bilyeu. See Majority\nOpinion, p. 7255. That concession guts the majority’s analy-\nsis, because a decisionmaker’s choice between two viable\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                  7273\ninterpretations of the facts cannot constitute abuse of discre-\ntion as a matter of law. See Hinkson, 585 F.3d at 1260\n(“Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the\nfactfinder’s choice between them cannot be clearly errone-\nous.”) (citation omitted). The district court acted within its\ndiscretion when it concluded that Bilyeu failed to exhaust the\nadministrative remedies available under the ERISA plan\nadministered by Unum. No legal or factual basis exists for\nreversing the district court’s ruling. Quite simply, as we stated\nin Diaz, “[b]y not submitting a written appeal to the Benefits\nAdministrator, [Bilyeu] failed to comply with the Plan’s inter-\nnal review procedures and hence did not exhaust the available\nadministrative remedies. . . .” Diaz, 50 F.3d at 1483 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n   I also part company with the majority in its analysis of the\ndistrict court’s ruling on the merits of Unum’s counterclaim.\n\n   Like the majority opinion, I start my analysis with the\nUnited States Supreme Court’s decision in Sereboff v. Mid\nAtlantic Medical Services, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145657\"><a href=\"/opinion/145657/sereboff-v-mid-atlantic-medical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 362-63 (2006).\nIn that case, the Supreme Court addressed the circumstances\nunder which an ERISA fiduciary may sue an ERISA benefi-\nciary for reimbursement when the beneficiary recovers from\na third party. See id. at 359. The Supreme Court relied on the\nequitable rule that an obligation to convey specific proceeds\nimposes a constructive trust on those proceeds. See id. at 362-\n64.\n\n   Applying the precepts of Sereboff to the facts of this case,\nI reach the same conclusion as the majority opinion regarding\nthe existence of an equitable trust. The ERISA Plan provided\nthat Bilyeu could receive full long-term disability benefits\npremised upon her agreement to reimburse Unum for any\noverpayment due to receipt of benefits from any other\nsources. Thus, any overpayment due to receipt of benefits\nfrom other sources would constitute the particular fund to\nwhich a constructive lien in favor of Unum applied.\n\f7274              BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\n   Although all parties agree that Bilyeu was obligated to\nreimburse Unum, the majority opinion lets Bilyeu off the\nhook, accepting her argument that she has already spent the\nmoney paid to her by Unum and, therefore, those specific pro-\nceeds can never be recovered. In doing so, the majority opin-\nion creates an unwarranted circuit split and completely\ndisregards the concept of fairness, the paramount principle of\nequity. See Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117984\"><a href=\"/opinion/117984/things-remembered-inc-v-petrarca/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133 (1995).\n\n   In Cusson v. Liberty Life Insurance Co. of Boston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204137\"><a href=\"/opinion/204137/cusson-v-liberty-life-assur-co-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 231-32 (1st Cir. 2010), the First Circuit considered a\ncase also involving overpayment of long-term disability bene-\nfits due to the receipt of social security benefits by the claim-\nant.\n\n   The claimant argued that the ERISA fiduciary advanced a\nlegal claim rather than an equitable claim, and therefore, the\nclaim was barred. See id. at 230. The First Circuit rejected this\nargument, concluding that it was inconsistent with the\nSupreme Court’s reasoning in Sereboff. See id. at 231. The\nFirst Circuit concluded that the rule of equity imposes a con-\nstructive trust on the proceeds as soon as they are acquired by\nthe recipient of those proceeds. See id. The First Circuit rea-\nsoned that because the contract between the ERISA fiduciary\nand the ERISA beneficiary put the ERISA beneficiary on\nnotice that reimbursement would be required if the ERISA\nbeneficiary was overpaid, enforcement of the resulting con-\nstructive trust constituted equitable relief. See id. Because the\ncircumstances in Cusson are virtually identical to the facts in\nthis case, there is no principled basis upon which Cusson can\nbe distinguished.\n\n   Similarly applying Sereboff, the Third Circuit in Funk v.\nCigna Grp. Ins., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"222509\"><a href=\"/opinion/222509/funk-v-cigna-group-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194 (3d Cir. 2011) held that\n“there is no tracing requirement for an equitable lien by agree-\nment. Property to which the lien attached may be converted\n\f                  BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                 7275\ninto other property without affecting the efficacy of the lien.”\n(citations and footnote reference omitted).\n\n   In Gilchrest v. Unum Life Insurance Co. of America, 255\nF. App’x 38 (6th Cir. 2007) (unpublished), the Sixth Circuit\ninterpreted Sereboff in a similar fashion, ruling that the\nenforcement of a constructive trust does not require “strict\ntracing of funds.” Id. at 45. Rather, the ERISA fiduciary must\nmerely identify a specific fund distinct from the general assets\nof the ERISA beneficiary for satisfaction of the ERISA fidu-\nciary’s equitable claim. This requirement was met by identify-\ning the proceeds of recoveries from any third party. See id.\nThis holding was reiterated in Longaberger Co. v. Kolt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1381855\"><a href=\"/opinion/1381855/longaberger-co-v-kolt/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 466 (6th Cir. 2009), with the Sixth Circuit declaring\nin a published opinion that “an equitable lien by agreement\ndoes not require tracing or maintenance of a fund in order for\nequity to allow repayment,” and citing Gilchrest with\napproval.\n\n   The Seventh Circuit reached the same result in Gutta v.\nStandard Select Trust Ins. Plans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1189239\"><a href=\"/opinion/1189239/gutta-v-standard-select-trust-ins-plans/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir.\n2008). Applying Sereboff, the Seventh Circuit recognized a\ndistinction between the “equitable lien by agreement” created\nby the reimbursement provision in the ERISA plan document\nand “an equitable lien sought as a matter of restitution.” Spe-\ncifically, for the former, “strict tracing of the funds to be\nrecovered was not required [under Sereboff]”. Id. at 620\n(quoting Sereboff, 126 S. Ct. at 1875). This distinction is per-\nsuasive in view of the express agreement by the beneficiary\nto reimburse the ERISA plan for any overpayment, without\nany limitation regarding the funding source of the repayment.\n\n   In Dillard’s Inc. v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">894</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 2006), the Eighth Circuit followed the approach\ntaken by the First, Sixth and Seventh Circuits. The Eighth Cir-\ncuit determined that the Supreme Court’s ruling in Sereboff\nprecluded the argument that the ERISA fiduciary’s reimburse-\nment claim sought legal damages. See id. at 901. The Eighth\n\f7276               BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\nCircuit explained that enforcement of an equitable lien by\nagreement was an equitable remedy rather than a legal one.\nSee id.\n\n   In an effort to distinguish the rulings of five of our sister\ncircuit courts, the majority relies on an out-of-circuit district\ncourt decision, Epolito v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2477342\"><a href=\"/opinion/2477342/epolito-v-prudential-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (M.D. Fla. 2010). See Majority Opinion, p.\n7265. The district court in Florida acknowledged the Supreme\nCourt’s holding in Sereboff that “strict tracing rules do not\napply to equitable liens by agreement. . . .” Id. at 1380 (quot-\ning Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 364). However, the district court\nstated that it would “not read Sereboff’s holding with respect\nto tracing as broadly” as the circuit courts. Id. I am not per-\nsuaded by the reasoning of the Florida district court. Indeed,\nit appears that the Eleventh Circuit does not agree with the\nreasoning in Epolito. See Popowski v. Parrott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1367</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1374 n.8 (11th Cir. 2006) (“[W]e observe that the Supreme\nCourt in Sereboff . . . clarified that the strict tracing require-\nments that apply to equitable liens . . . do not apply to equita-\nble liens by agreement. . . .”) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Florida district court acknowledged this\nlanguage in the Eleventh Circuit’s decision, but dismissed it\nas dicta. See Epolito, 737 F. Supp. 2d at 1381 n.8.\n\n   The Florida district court also gave extremely short shrift\nto the Eleventh Circuit decision in Admin. Comm. for the Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. Assocs.’ Health & Welfare Plan v. Horton,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77914\"><a href=\"/opinion/77914/administrative-committee-for-wal-mart-v-horton/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1227 & n.4 (11th Cir. 2008) (concluding that\nthe ERISA Plan’s action to recover overpayment from a third-\nparty was equitable in nature).\n\n   The majority opinion seeks to bolster the district court’s\nruling in Epolito by reference to Great-West Life & Annuity\nIns. Co. v. Knudson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118471\"><a href=\"/opinion/118471/great-west-life-annuity-ins-co-v-knudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002). See Majority Opin-\nion, pp. 7265-66. However, the First Circuit convincingly dis-\ntinguished Knudson, noting that in Knudson, the funds in\nquestion were never actually in the possession of the ERISA\n\f                   BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY                  7277\nbeneficiaries. See Cusson, 592 F.3d at 230; see also Sereboff,\n547 U.S. at 365-66 (distinguishing Knudson). The First Cir-\ncuit persuasively explained that Sereboff is the governing pre-\ncedent when the funds in question are controlled by the\nERISA beneficiary. See id.\n\n   The majority’s reliance on general language in Amschwand\nv. Spherion Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"52846\"><a href=\"/opinion/52846/amschwand-v-spherion-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (5th Cir. 2007) regard-\ning the general principles of equity does not in any way dilute\nthe force of the five circuit courts that have interpreted Sereb-\noff as not imposing a tracing requirement on funds being\nsought pursuant to an equitable agreement. This tracing dis-\ncussion from Sereboff was totally ignored by the Fifth Circuit.\n\n   The main problem with the majority’s reliance on CIGNA\nCorp. v. Amara, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"216734\"><a href=\"/opinion/216734/cigna-corp-v-amara/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1866</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011), a recent case from\nthe United States Supreme Court, is that the cited language is\npart of the preliminary discussion from the Court prior to its\nanalysis of the actual issues presented. See id. at 1879\n(“[T]raditionally speaking, relief that sought a lien or a con-\nstructive trust was legal relief, not equitable relief, unless the\nfunds in question were particular funds or property in the\ndefendant’s possession.”) (citation omitted) (emphasis in the\noriginal). The Court then went on to discuss the imposition of\nan injunction against the ERISA Plan Administrator, with no\nmention of the tracing issue. See id. at 1879-80.\n\n   Another problem with the majority’s reliance on Amara is\nthat the quoted language is entirely consistent with the analy-\nsis in Sereboff. See 547 U.S. at 364-65 (noting that the com-\nmon law requirement of tracing property to “some particular\nfunds or assets” applied to an equitable lien by restitution but\nnot to an equitable lien by agreement) (citation omitted).\n\n   The final problem with the majority’s reliance on Amara is\nthat it never mentions, let alone purports to overrule, the anal-\nysis in Sereboff. Indeed, because Sereboff specifically\n\f7278               BILYEU v. MORGAN STANLEY\naddresses the issue presented to us, it is the more applicable\nSupreme Court precedent.\n\n   The majority opinion also quotes at length from various\ntreatises. See Majority Opinion, pp. 7266-67. However, it is\nwell-established that treatises are a compilation of general\nprinciples of law, rather than concrete application of princi-\nples of law to a defined set of facts. See Hart v. Massanari,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775090\"><a href=\"/opinion/775090/patricia-hart-v-larry-g-massanari-acting-commissioner-of-social-security/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1169-70, 1171-73 (9th Cir. 2001) (explaining\nthat persuasive authority, including treatises, cannot overcome\nthe force of Supreme Court precedent).\n\n   I am also not persuaded by the majority’s citation to Bonne-\nville Power Admin. v. Wash. Pub. Power Supply Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578190\"><a href=\"/opinion/578190/bonneville-power-administration-v-washington-public-power-supply-system-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1507 (9th Cir. 1992). See Majority Opinion, p.\n7268-69. That case predates Sereboff by almost fifteen years\nand is inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s reasoning.\nRather than creating an indefensible circuit split, I would\nadhere to the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Sereboff as\ninterpreted by our sister circuits, and conclude that strict trac-\ning of the overpaid funds is not required to enforce an equita-\nble lien by agreement. If the ERISA fiduciary were seeking\nreimbursement in the absence of an agreement to reimburse\nany overpayment, I would agree with the majority opinion\nthat application of the holding in Knudson would be appropri-\nate. However, where the ERISA beneficiary expressly agrees\nto reimburse the Plan for any benefit overpayment, as in this\ncase, enforcement of the resulting equitable lien by agreement\nconstitutes an equitable remedy rather than a legal one, and\nSereboff controls. See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 368 (recognizing\nthe distinction between an equitable lien premised on restitu-\ntion principles and an equitable lien premised on an agree-\nment). The district court’s decision in this case properly\napplied Sereboff and its judgment should be affirmed in its\nentirety.\n\f</pre>",
