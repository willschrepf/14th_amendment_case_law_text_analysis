Namely, the final\n\nsummary judgment granting declaratory relief in favor of Strandhagen\n\nshould be reversed because: (1) Strandhagen was required to establish two\n\nelements to prevail on her affirmative defense, and she conceded her\n\ninability to establish the first element; (2) even if Strandhagen was required\n\nto prove only one element, she failed to conclusively establish the second\n\nelement; (3) Strandhagen did not satisfy her summary-judgment burden of\n\nproof regarding the Physicians’ third-party beneficiary status; and (4) the\n\ntrial court lacked jurisdiction over Strandhagen’s unripe declaratory\n\njudgment claim, and it erred in denying the Physicians’ Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction on this basis.\n\n      Strandhagen offers no response to argument (3) in her Appellee’s\n\nBrief. Based on the argument and authorities presented by the Physicians,\n\nand Strandhagen’s abandonment of this issue, the Court should conclude\n\nthat Strandhagen’s prior argument regarding the Physicians’ third-party-\n\nbeneficiary status does not provide a ground upon which to affirm the\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                      1\n\f     Consequently, the summary judgment must either stand or fall based\n\non Strandhagen’s other ground for unenforceability of the liquidated\n\ndamages provision: her argument that it is a penalty.         Although the\n\nPhysicians maintain their arguments (1) and (4), this Reply Brief focuses on\n\nargument (2). Regardless of the scope of Strandhagen’s burden of proof\n\nand regardless of the claim’s ripeness, the summary judgment should be\n\nreversed because Strandhagen failed to conclusively prove the second\n\nelement of her defense (“unreasonable forecast”).\n\nI.   STRANDHAGEN FAILED TO CONCLUSIVELY ESTABLISH\n     ELEMENT TWO: “UNREASONABLE FORECAST.”\n\n     Strandhagen agrees with the Physicians that, as the party seeking to\n\ninvalidate the liquidated damages clause, she had the summary-judgment\n\nburden to conclusively establish that the clause did not provide a\n\nreasonable forecast of just compensation.            Appellee’s Brief, p.9.\n\nStrandhagen argues that she satisfied this burden by proving that the clause\n\nwas invalid “on its face,” and was therefore excused from the requirement\n\nof proving actual damages in comparison to the liquidated damages\n\namount. Id., p.12-13. This Court should reject her argument because Texas\n\ncase law recognizes only two theories of “facial invalidity” as exceptions to\n\nthe general requirement of proving actual damages, and Strandhagen has\n\n\n                                     2\n\ffailed to conclusively demonstrate that this liquidated damages provision\n\nsatisfies either theory.   Strandhagen offers nothing more than broad\n\nassumptions without any supporting proof.\n\n     A.    General Rule: Proof of Actual Damages is Required.\n\n     Strandhagen’s argument over-generalizes the law regarding facial\n\nchallenges to liquidated damages provisions.      Without specifying the\n\nreasons why certain provisions have been held facially invalid, Strandhagen\n\ncites a string of cases for the implication that a facial challenge broadly\n\nprovides an alternative in every case to the requirement of proving actual\n\ndamages. See id., p.13-14. This is not an accurate assessment of Texas law.\n\nContrary to Strandhagen’s argument, Texas courts have invalidated\n\nliquidated damage provisions based on only two types of facial challenges,\n\nand have oft recognized the limitations of these theories. Infra, Reply\n\nArgument I.B.\n\n     The general rule remains that a party is required to prove an\n\nunreasonable disparity between the amount of actual damages and the\n\namount of liquidated damages to satisfy its burden of proof on the\n\n“unreasonable forecast” element of penalty.     Many cases recognize this\n\ngeneral standard. See Appellants’ Brief, p.23-25 (citing Phillips, Healix,\n\nTriton, Southern Union, and GPA Holdings); see also, e.g., Garden Ridge,\n\n                                    3\n\fL.P. v. Advance Int’l, Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432, 440 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2013, pet. denied) (“[T]o determine whether a term fixes\n\nunreasonably large liquidated damages, it follows that courts would need to\n\nconsider what actual harm, if any, was caused by the breach and then\n\ncompare it to the stipulated amount of liquidated damages.”); Chan v.\n\nMontebello Dev. Co., No. 14-06-00936-CV, 2008 WL 2986379, at *3-4\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied) (“[T]o meet this\n\nburden [of proving unreasonable forecast], the party asserting the defense\n\nis required to prove the amount of the other parties’ actual damages, if any,\n\nto show that the liquidated damages are not an approximation of the\n\nstipulated sum.”); CDS Enters., Inc. v. Myrad Real Estate, Inc., No. 14-97-\n\n00197-CV, 1999 WL 548226, *2-3 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999,\n\nno pet.) (“Texcon was required to prove the amount of Myrad’s actual\n\ndamages, if any, for establishing an absence of an approximation between\n\nthe actual loss and the stipulated sum. . . . Texcon did not meet its burden\n\nin proving the liquidated damages clause was unenforceable because it\n\nfailed to prove the amount of Myrad’s actual damages.”); Oetting v. Flake,\n\n553 S.W.2d 793, 795 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1977, no writ) (“The [party\n\nseeking to invalidate the clause], by both allegation and proof, must raise\n\nthe issue and assume the burden of proving the amount of the actual\n\n\n                                     4\n\fdamages for the purpose of showing an absence of approximation between\n\nthe actual loss and the stipulated sum.”).\n\n            1.    It is undisputed that Strandhagen offered no\n                  proof of actual damages.\n\n      The record plainly demonstrates that Strandhagen offered no\n\nevidence of the amount of any actual damages suffered by the Physicians.\n\nStrandhagen does not contend otherwise. See Appellee’s Brief, p.14. Thus,\n\nthe only way to hold that Strandhagen satisfied her summary-judgment\n\nburden of proof on the “unreasonable forecast” element would be to\n\nconclude that she established, as a matter of law, that the liquidated\n\ndamages provision satisfies a “facial invalidity” exception to the general\n\nrequirement of proving actual damages.       Strandhagen did not do so,\n\nmeaning the summary judgment must be reversed.\n\n      B.    Narrow Exceptions: Two Types of Facial Invalidity.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court has recognized two exceptions in which a\n\nparty may satisfy its burden of proving that a liquidated damages provision\n\nis not a reasonable forecast of just compensation in the absence of proof of\n\nactual damages. These two exceptions arise where the liquidated damages\n\nprovision is deemed unenforceable “on its face” or “as a matter of law”\n\neither because:    (1) the amount of liquidated damages is based on a\n\n\n                                      5\n\fmultiplier of actual damages or (2) the liquidated damages provision is\n\ntriggered by any breach of the contract without regard to the importance or\n\ntriviality of the breach. Strandhagen labels the latter a “one size fits all”\n\nprovision.    The liquidated damages provision in the parties’ Operations\n\nAgreement does not satisfy exception.\n\n             1.   Multiplier of actual damages:\n\n      In Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 789 (Tex. 1991) the Court did\n\nnot hold, as Strandhagen suggests, that the second element (unreasonable\n\nforecast) can be satisfied in every case with either a facial challenge or proof\n\nof actual damages. See FPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Mgmt. Co., LP,\n\n426 S.W.3d 59, 72 (Tex. 2014) (“Phillips did not create a broad power to\n\nretroactively invalidate liquidated damages provisions that appear\n\nreasonable as written. Nor do we create such a power here.”) (rejecting\n\nfacial challenge to liquidated damages clause).\n\n      The Phillips court merely held a facial challenge was satisfactory in\n\nthat particular case because the liquidated damages amount was a\n\nmultiplier (10x) of the actual damages. 820 S.W.2d at 787. “The provision\n\ncannot meet the second prong of the test because, instead of attempting to\n\nforecast actual damages, it calls for them to be determined and then\n\nmultiplied.” Id. at 789; see also Magill v. Watson, 409 S.W.3d 673, 681\n\n\n                                       6\n\f(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.) (reaching same conclusion\n\nwhere liquidated damages provision multiplied actual damages by three).\n\n      Following Phillips, this Court and others courts have recognized that\n\nthe unique facial invalidity present there does not automatically relieve the\n\nburden in all cases to prove an unreasonable disparity between the actual\n\ndamages and liquidated damages amounts. See e.g., Khan v. Meknojiya,\n\nNo. 03-11-00580-CV, 2013 WL 3336874, at *4 n.4 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013,\n\nno pet.) (“Meknojiya’s reliance on Phillips in this case is misplaced” because\n\nthe provision “does not require a separate determination of damages or the\n\napplication of any multiplier to that amount. Thus, . . . unlike the court in\n\nPhillips we could not conclude that it constitutes a penalty on its face.”);\n\nDunlap v. Gayle, No. 13-12-00105-CV, 2013 WL 1500377, *6 (Tex. App.—\n\nCorpus Christi 2013, no pet.) (liquidated damages provision based on a\n\nmultiplier of earnest money rather than actual damages was not facially\n\ninvalid under Phillips).\n\n      The liquidated damages provision in this case does not rely on a\n\nmultiplier of actual damages.        (CR.168).    Thus, just as in Khan,\n\nStrandhagen’s reliance on Phillips to establish a facial invalidity is\n\nmisplaced.\n\n\n\n\n                                      7\n\f            2.    One size fits all:\n\n      The only other type of facial invalidity recognized by Texas courts\n\narises when a provision imposes the same amount of liquidated damages\n\nfor both substantial and trivial breaches. See, e.g., Stewart v. Basey, 245\n\nS.W.2d 484, 487 (Tex. 1952) (in building lease agreement, clause providing\n\nfor liquidated damages of $150/month for each month of the remaining\n\nterm for any breach of the agreement, whether it be a failure to perform the\n\nmost important obligation or a minor covenant, was facially invalid);\n\nCommunity Dev. Serv., Inc. v. Replacement Parts Mfg., Inc., 679 S.W.2d\n\n721, 727 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1984, no writ) (liquidated damages\n\nclause was unenforceable because, even though it provided reasonable\n\ndamages for major breaches of the contract, it also allowed unreasonable\n\ndamages for trivial breaches); Bethel v. Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d\n\n834, 837 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.)\n\n(liquidated damages provision was facially invalid where it “would apply\n\nwith equal force for such trivial breaches by appellee Butler as failing to pay\n\nutilities, provide parking space or pay an additional hourly labor charge of\n\n$10.00,” as well as to full termination of contract without cause); Mayfield\n\nv. Hicks, 575 S.W.2d 571, 575 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1978, writ ref’d n.r.e.)\n\n\n\n\n                                       8\n\f(provision was unenforceable because liquidated damages could be\n\nimposed upon “even a minor default”).\n\n                    a.     Strandhagen failed to prove that this is a\n                           facially invalid “one size fits all” provision.\n\n      Unlike all of the foregoing cases, the liquidated damages provision\n\nhere is triggered by only one form of breach, and it is a major one: a\n\nphysician’s early departure from the practice without just cause, as\n\nspecified in the contract.        (CR.167-169); Appellants’ Brief, p.7, 26-27.\n\nHence, this provision is facially valid, as the court concluded in Urban\n\nTelevision Network Corp. v. Liquidity Solutions, L.P., 277 S.W.3d 917, 919-\n\n20 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, no pet.).            There, the court disagreed “with\n\nappellant’s assertion that the liquidated damages provision applied to any\n\nbreach of the agreement, no matter how trivial” because—as in this case—\n\nthe liquidated damages were recoverable for only “material” defaults\n\nspecified within the contract. 1\n\n\n\n1     See also Appellants’ Brief, p.27-29 (discussing support provided by Murphy v.\nCintas Corp., 923 S.W.2d 663, 666 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1996, writ denied) and\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356, Liquidated Damages and Penalties (1981)).\nStrandhagen’s attempt to distinguish these authorities fails. See Appellee’s Brief, p.14\nn.10. Contrary to her argument, the Physicians do not cite Murphy and the\nRESTATEMENT for the proposition that actual damages must be proven in all cases.\nRather, these authorities demonstrate why Strandhagen was required to prove actual\ndamages here because her facial challenge fails. Just as in Murphy, the timing of the\nbreach does not render the clause per se unreasonable, and just as in the RESTATEMENT,\nthe Court’s focus should be on the actual circumstances present here. Appellants’ Brief,\np.8.\n                                           9\n\f     In attempt to overcome the blatant distinction between this case and\n\nthe ones she relies upon, Strandhagen claims that the amount of damages\n\nresulting from this one type of material breach (early departure) “would\n\nobviously be greater the earlier Dr. Strandhagen stopped working at AAT.”\n\nAppellee’s Brief, p.17.   Strandhagen offered no proof to support this\n\nallegedly “obvious” outcome.\n\n     Contrary to Strandhagen’s unsupported conclusion, there is no\n\n“obvious” reason why the damages suffered would vary greatly depending\n\non when she or another physician left the practice.          Following any\n\ndeparture constituting a breach, the practice would be disrupted, suffer a\n\nloss of goodwill, incur scheduling and short-staffing issues, and incur costs\n\nand expenses related to finding a temporary and/or long-term replacement\n\nfor the departed physician—all of which would have a negative impact on\n\nthe group’s profit-making and bonus-earning capabilities. See Appellants’\n\nBrief, p.4-7, 26-27. Whether the departure occurred in year 1 or year 5,\n\nthese negative impacts would be felt for some period of time before a\n\nreplacement physician could be located, trained, and incorporated into the\n\npractice; the goodwill could be rebuilt; and the profitability could be\n\nrestored.\n\n\n\n\n                                     10\n\f     In the absence of any evidence offered by Strandhagen, there is no\n\nway to know what amount of damages would be incurred for a breach at the\n\nstart of the term versus a breach at the end of the term, and certainly no\n\nway to conclude that the damage amounts would be vastly different at\n\neither time. Moreover, without any proof from Strandhagen, there is no\n\nway to conclude that the liquidated amount of $500,000 would be greatly\n\ndisproportionate to the actual damages suffered for any such breach. This\n\nwas Strandhagen’s burden to prove, and she failed to prove it.          The\n\nsummary judgment should be reversed.\n\n     Several cases demonstrate that unsupported conclusions like\n\nStrandhagen’s are insufficient to carry the burden of proof on this type of\n\nfacial challenge. In SP Terrace, L.P. v. Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC, 334\n\nS.W.3d 275, 287-88 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.), the\n\ncourt rejected SP Terrace’s facial challenge because it “adduced no\n\nevidence” to establish that the amount of liquidated damages was\n\nunreasonable either because the “breach was a trivial one” or because the\n\nbreach was of a far greater magnitude than would be justly compensated.\n\nId. (“We decline to remove a limitation of remedy provision absent any\n\nevidence that the liquidated amount in the contract is unreasonably high or\n\nlow in light of the alleged breach.”); see also Urban Television, 277 S.W.3d\n\n\n                                     11\n\fat 920 (“Appellant has not established that the liquidated damages\n\nprovision is unenforceable on its face or presented evidence raising a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to its enforceability.”); R. Conrad Moore &\n\nAssoc., Inc. v. Lerma, 946 S.W.2d 90, 96 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1997, writ\n\ndenied) (where liquidated damage amount would be the amount of earnest\n\nmoney regardless of time of breach, clause was not unreasonable on its\n\nface; proof of actual damages was necessary to satisfy this element);\n\nCommunity Dev., 679 S.W.2d at 727 (jury findings and evidence supported\n\nclaim that provision operated as penalty); In re Dow Corning Corp., 419\n\nF.3d 543, 552 (6th Cir. 2005) (Dow satisfied its burden to prove\n\nunreasonable forecast by presenting evidence that the parties never\n\ndiscussed potential damages at the time of making the contract and “that\n\nthe clause was initially proposed as a penalty untied to any potential\n\ndamages”). Strandhagen offered absolutely no evidence in support of her\n\ncontention that the magnitude of the breach would be greater depending on\n\nits timing. Without any proof, Strandhagen’s bare conclusion cannot be\n\naccepted in satisfaction of her summary-judgment burden.\n\n     Strandhagen has not cited and the Physicians have not found a single\n\ncase rendering a liquidated damages provision akin to this one\n\nunenforceable on the basis of a “one size fits all” facial challenge. The case\n\n\n                                     12\n\fStrandhagen specifically relies on for this proposition is distinguishable.\n\nSee Appellee’s Brief, p.17 (citing Eberts v. Businesspeople Personnel Servs.,\n\nInc., 620 S.W.2d 861 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1981, no writ). In Eberts, the\n\nprovision was deemed unenforceable because it would impose the same\n\namount of liquidated damages regardless of whether the breach continued\n\nfor one day or two years. Id. at 864. Here, the liquidated damages are not\n\nimposed upon variable lengths of a “continuing” breach.         Instead, the\n\nbreach would occur at the moment of improper early departure, as\n\nspecified in the contract. As discussed above, the practice would suffer\n\ndisruption and financial hardship for some period of time following that\n\nbreach whether it occurred in year 1 or year 5. Strandhagen offered no\n\nevidence to establish that the length of disruption or magnitude of hardship\n\nwould vary depending on the time of the breach. The liquidated damages\n\nare intended to justly compensate for these negative financial effects,\n\nwhenever incurred.\n\n     C.    Conclusion on “Unreasonable Forecast.”\n\n     To satisfy her summary-judgment burden of proof on the second\n\nelement of her penalty affirmative defense (“unreasonable forecast”),\n\nStrandhagen would generally be required to prove actual damages and\n\n\n\n\n                                     13\n\fdemonstrate an unreasonable disparity between that amount and the\n\nliquidated damages amount. Strandhagen admittedly failed to do so.\n\n     In the alternative, Strandhagen could satisfy her burden of proof by\n\ndemonstrating, as a matter of law, that this liquidated damages provision is\n\ninvalid on its face because it is a “one size fits all” provision. Strandhagen\n\nfailed to carry her burden of proof on this theory because (1) the liquidated\n\ndamages are triggered by only one form of material breach, early departure\n\nfrom the practice under specified circumstances; and (2) Strandhagen\n\noffered nothing beyond speculation to establish that a physician’s early\n\ndeparture would constitute a breach of greater magnitude if it occurred\n\nearlier than later in the physician’s term of employment. Consequently,\n\nStrandhagen has failed to prove that the liquidated damages would be\n\nequally imposed upon breaches of both important and trivial natures.\n\nStrandhagen therefore failed to demonstrate any facial invalidity as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n     Because Strandhagen has failed to satisfy her summary-judgment\n\nburden of proof on the second element of her affirmative defense (and she\n\nconcedes her inability to prove the first element), the summary judgment\n\nshould be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     14\n\fII.   ADDITIONAL REPLY ARGUMENTS:\n\n      A.   Arguments Made in the Physicians’ Motion for New\n           Trial Were Preserved for Review.\n\n      Strandhagen argues that arguments made by the Physicians for the\n\nfirst time in their Motion for New Trial were not preserved for review.\n\nAppellee’s Brief, p.5, 7, 20. Although it may generally be true that an\n\nargument raised for the first time in a motion for new trial is not preserved,\n\nthere is an exception applicable here.\n\n      “[T]he efficacy of a post-judgment motion to preserve a complaint for\n\nappellate review depends upon whether the trial court affirmatively\n\nconsiders the new grounds and proof as memorialized by a written order.”\n\nCharbonnet v. Shami, No. 04-12-00711-CV, 2013 WL 2645720, *5 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio 2013, pet. denied). Where the court considers the new\n\ngrounds asserted in the post-judgment motion and signs a new order\n\naffirming its prior ruling based upon the entire record—as opposed to\n\nsimply allowing the motion to be overruled by operation of law—the new\n\narguments are preserved for review. Id. at *5-6; see also Ayeni v. State,\n\n440 S.W.3d 707, 709 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013, no pet.) (arguments and\n\nevidence presented in motion for reconsideration of summary judgment\n\nwere preserved where order specified that court considered these\n\narguments and evidence). None of the cases cited by Strandhagen in\n                                      15\n\fsupport of her waiver argument reflect that such circumstances were\n\npresent to satisfy this exception; thus, they are distinguishable from this\n\ncase. See Appellee’s Brief, p.21 n.18.\n\n      Strandhagen acknowledges that there was “full briefing and a\n\nhearing” on the arguments raised in the Physicians’ Motion for New Trial.\n\nAppellee’s Brief, p.6. Moreover, the Order Denying the Motion for New\n\nTrial expressly states that the district court “considered the grounds\n\nasserted in the Motion, the Response, the arguments of counsel, the\n\nevidence filed, and the contents of the Court’s file” in making its\n\ndetermination. (CR.271). Because it is apparent from the record that the\n\narguments raised by the Physicians in their Motion for New Trial were\n\nconsidered on their merits and denied, these arguments were preserved for\n\nreview. See generally Tex. R. App. P. 33.1.\n\n      B.    The Physicians “Modification” Argument Was Not an\n            Affirmative Defense.\n\n      The Physicians argued that the severability clause in Section 7(f) of\n\nthe Operations Agreement demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact\n\nabout the interpretation and enforceability of the liquidated damages\n\nprovision. (CR.223) (arguing that “a genuine issue of material fact remains\n\nabout what modified amount or calculation would be reasonable to enforce\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fin[stead of the $500,000 liquidated amount]” based on the severability\n\nclause).\n\n      Contrary to Strandhagen’s argument, the Physicians’ argument did\n\nnot present the affirmative defense of “modification.” See, e.g., Williams v.\n\nColthurst, 253 S.W.3d 353, 359 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2008, no pet.)\n\n(affirmative defense of modification is based on argument that parties had\n\na “meeting of the minds” to a new agreement “supported by consideration,”\n\nsuch as an “accord and satisfaction”); Hill v. Heritage Res., Inc., 964\n\nS.W.2d 89, 113 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1997, pet. denied) (“To conclude that\n\nthere was a valid modification, the jury had to favorably determine two\n\nelements. The first is that the modification is based upon new\n\nconsideration. The second is that there existed the same degree of\n\nmutuality and meeting of the minds as was present for the original\n\ncontract.”) (collecting cases; citations omitted).\n\n      The Physicians were in no way seeking to avoid the enforcement of\n\nthe parties’ contract by arguing that the parties had reached a new,\n\nmodified agreement supported by sufficient consideration, as would be the\n\ncase under the affirmative defense of modification. Instead, the Physicians\n\nwere simply arguing that Strandhagen failed to carry her traditional\n\nsummary-judgment burden because a genuine issue of material fact existed\n\n\n                                       17\n\fwithin the four corners of the Operations Agreement, which was part of the\n\noriginal summary-judgment record. Hence, there were no “elements” on\n\nwhich the Physicians carried the burden of proof.\n\n        C.   Strandhagen Cannot Use the Declaratory Judgment\n             Act to Create Jurisdiction.\n\n        Strandhagen argues that a live controversy sufficient to support\n\njurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgments Act (“DJA”) exists based on\n\nthe arguments presented by the Physicians to this Court regarding the\n\nproper interpretation of the liquidated damages provision. Appellee’s Brief,\n\np.24, 26.    To accept Strandhagen’s argument would turn the DJA on its\n\nhead.\n\n        The DJA cannot be used to create jurisdiction where a live\n\ncontroversy does not already exist.       See Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air\n\nControl Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex. 1993) (“[W]e have interpreted the\n\n[DJA] to be merely a procedural device for deciding cases already within a\n\ncourt’s jurisdiction rather than a legislative enlargement of a court’s power,\n\npermitting the rendition of advisory opinions.”); Devon Energy Prod. Co. v.\n\nKCS Res., LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203, 210, 212 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2014, pet. filed on other grounds) (same; holding court lacked jurisdiction\n\nover declaratory judgment claim because it was premised on the happening\n\nof a future, hypothetical event—an underlying legal determination about\n\n                                     18\n\fthe parties’ intent); Taylor v. State Farm Lloyds, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 665,\n\n668-69 (Tex. App.—Austin, 2003, pet. denied) (“[The DJA] does not confer\n\njurisdiction on a trial court but rather makes declaratory judgment\n\navailable as a remedy for a cause of action already within the court’s\n\njurisdiction.”) (citing Chenault v. Phillips, 914 S.W.2d 140, 141 (Tex. 1996)\n\n(holding that mere request for declaratory judgment does not establish\n\njurisdiction)).\n\n      Here, there is no evidence that the Physicians had taken any action or\n\nthreatened or pursue a claim for breach of contract against Strandhagen.\n\nAt most, Strandhagen’s affidavit includes a conclusory and speculative\n\nstatement that she “learned . . . [the Physicians] and perhaps others are\n\nseeking to pursue her for collection.” (CR.8, 12). In reality, the Physicians\n\nnever took any action to pursue a claim against her. If there was any\n\nevidence that the Physicians had done so, Strandhagen surely would have\n\npresented that evidence to the district court to demonstrate jurisdiction.\n\nShe now blames the Physicians for being unable to prove a negative.\n\n      Before      any   actual   dispute    or   controversy   ripened   between\n\nStrandhagen and the Physicians, Strandhagen filed this preemptive suit,\n\nwhich the Physicians were then forced to answer and defend. At that time,\n\nan active controversy existed between Strandhagen and her employer\n\n\n                                           19\n\f(AAT) regarding whether or not she had been terminated for cause.\n\n(CR.39, 80, 85-87, 91-93, 144). The Physicians were entitled to wait and\n\nsee how that issue developed and/or was resolved before deciding whether\n\nto pursue a claim against Strandhagen because her early departure would\n\nnot be considered a breach of the Operations Agreement if it resulted from\n\nAAT’s termination of her employment without cause. (CR.168). On this\n\nbasis, when Strandhagen filed suit against the Physicians, their\n\ndetermination about whether or not to pursue a claim against Strandhagen\n\nremained an open, theoretical issue. 2\n\n      The fact that the Physicians have defended the validity of their\n\ncontractual language does not demonstrate that a sufficiently ripe claim for\n\nbreach of contract existed at the time Strandhagen filed suit for purposes of\n\njurisdiction. The trial court erred in denying the Physicians’ Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction and in granting Strandhagen’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n\non this basis.\n\n\n\n2      Strandhagen cites to page 8 of Appellants’ Brief as proof of that an allegedly ripe\ncontroversy existed. Appellee’s Brief, p.26. She claims the Physicians “admit[ted]” that\nher employment was terminated “under circumstances where they contend she ‘would\nbe liable for payment of liquidated damages.’” Id. Rather than “acknowledging” the\nexistence of a ripe controversy, the Physicians argument is presented in hypothetical\nterms: “If [it] were true [that Strandhagen was terminated on the basis of\ndiscrimination] it would provide [an] exception to her liability under the liquidated\ndamages provision. . . . [On the other hand, if the Company were correct that]\nStrandhagen quit or was terminated with cause in September 2013 . . . [then she] would\nbe liable for payment of liquidated damages.” Appellants’ Brief, p.8.\n                                           20\n\f                                  PRAYER\n      Based on the foregoing, Appellants respectfully pray that this Court\n\nsustain both of their issues on appeal and reverse the district court’s grant\n\nof Strandhagen’s Motion for Summary Judgment, its partial denial of the\n\nPhysicians’ Plea to the Jurisdiction, and its denial of the Physicians’ Motion\n\nfor New Trial. If the jurisdictional ruling is reversed, then this Court should\n\nrender judgment in favor of the Physicians dismissing Strandhagen’s claim\n\nin its entirety. Otherwise, this Court should remand to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n      Appellants further pray that this Court tax all costs against\n\nStrandhagen, both in this Court and below, and award the Appellants any\n\nsuch other relief at law or equity to which they may be justly entitled.

We will affirm\nthe judgment.\n\n\n\n                                            BACKGROUND\n\nAppellant Ayeni operated a convenience store out of his residence in Houston, Texas. The\nComptroller conducted a sales-tax audit of Ayeni's business for the period covering January 1,\n2004, through December 31, 2006. Ayeni acknowledges that he “did not keep a good record of his\nbusiness documents,” 1 and in the absence of such records, the Comptroller resorted to estimating\nAyeni's sales and tax liability from records of Ayeni's beer purchases obtained from certain of his\nvendors and industry sales averages. 2 Through these calculations, the Comptroller determined\nthat Ayeni owed the appellee taxing authorities 3 approximately $48,000 in unpaid sales taxes for\nthe audit period, penalties, and interest.\n\nAfter Ayeni failed to pay the determination, the Comptroller issued a certificate of tax delinquency\nto the Attorney General's office for collection. The Attorney General subsequently sued Ayeni\non appellees' behalf to recover the delinquent sales taxes, penalties, and interest as set forth in\nthe Comptroller's certificate of deficiency, plus attorney's fees. Ayeni filed a general denial, later\namended to a verified denial. Appellees filed a traditional motion for summary judgment on all\nof their claims, attaching as evidence the Comptroller's certificate and an affidavit from appellees'\ncounsel averring that they had incurred $7,500 in attorney's fees in the proceeding. Ayeni filed\na response to appellees' motion and a supplement, presenting affidavits *709 from himself and\nhis bookkeeper in which each disputed the accuracy of the Comptroller's tax calculations and\nunderlying estimates of Ayeni's beer sales. In further support, Ayeni attached numerous receipts\nthat purported to reflect actual beer purchases by Ayeni. Ayeni also presented an affidavit from\nhis counsel attempting to controvert appellees' attorney's fees affidavit.\n\nFollowing a hearing, the district court granted partial summary judgment that Ayeni was liable\nfor the deficiency in the certified amount. However, it denied appellees' motion on their claim for\nattorney's fees.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   2\n\fAyeni v. State, 440 S.W.3d 707 (2013)\n\n\n\nAyeni filed a motion to reconsider the partial summary judgment, attaching additional documents\nfrom the Comptroller reflecting the Comptroller's methodology in estimating the sales taxes Ayeni\nowed. Following a hearing, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration by written\norder. To ensure “a clear appellate record,” the order further specified that the district court had\nultimately considered the entirety of the evidence and arguments Ayeni had filed in the case in\nits summary-judgment ruling.\n\nSubsequently, the district court signed a final judgment incorporating its earlier partial summary\njudgment and awarding appellees $2,000 in attorney's fees. 4 It is from this final judgment that\nAyeni now appeals.\n\n\n\n                                               ANALYSIS\n\nAyeni seeks reversal of the district court's judgment in four issues that claim error in the summary-\njudgment ruling. In his first two issues, Ayeni asserts that he presented summary-judgment\nevidence of his tax liability that controverted the Comptroller's certificate and raised a fact issue\nthat precluded summary judgment for appellees. In his third issue, Ayeni insists that the district\ncourt erred or abused its discretion by granting partial summary judgment when appellees had\ninstead sought a final summary judgment. In his fourth issue, Ayeni argues that the Comptroller's\ncertificate of delinquency could not support summary judgment in appellees' favor in the face of\nAyeni's verified denial.\n\n\nStandard of review\nThe standards of review for summary judgments are well established. We review the summary-\njudgment motion and response, if any, de novo to determine if the competent summary-judgment\nevidence included with those pleadings shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\nand the movant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c);\nValence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex.2005). We take as true all evidence\nfavorable to the non-movant, and we indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts\nin the non-movant's favor. See Valence, 164 S.W.3d at 661.\n\n [1] Where, as here, the movant relies on the “traditional” summary-judgment standard, the\nmovant has the initial burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material fact and\nthat he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See M.D. Anderson Hosp. & Tumor Inst.\nv. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d 22, 23 (Tex.2000) (per curiam). Assuming this burden is met, and only if\nit is, the burden shifts to the non-movant to present evidence raising a genuine issue of material\nfact as to the movant's claims. See id. If the non-movant's evidence raises a fact issue, summary\njudgment is not appropriate. See id.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

State, 440 S.W.3d 707 (2013)\n\n\n\n\n *710 Verified denial\n [2] We begin with Ayeni's fourth issue because it logically precedes the others—it amounts to\na challenge to whether appellees' summary-judgment proof was sufficient to meet their initial\nburden of showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment\nas a matter of law. See id. To meet their burden as to Ayeni's sales tax liability, appellees relied\nsolely on the Comptroller's certificate of delinquency. As Ayeni acknowledges, subsection (a) of\ntax code section 111.013 makes the Comptroller's certificate—\n\n   ... prima facie evidence of:\n\n   (1) the stated tax or amount of the tax, after all just and lawful offsets, payments, and credits\n      have been allowed;\n\n   (2) the stated amount of penalties and interest;\n\n   (3) the delinquency of the amounts; and\n\n   (4) the compliance of the comptroller with the applicable provisions of this code in computing\n      and determining the amount due.\n\nTex. Tax Code Ann. § 111.013(a) (West 2008). Consequently, it is well established that a\nComptroller's certificate of delinquency suffices to meet a taxing authority's initial summary-\njudgment burden in a sales-tax deficiency suit, shifting the burden to the taxpayer to raise a fact\nissue in order to avoid summary judgment. See N.S. Sportswear, Inc. v. State, 819 S.W.2d 230,\n232 (Tex.App.-Austin 1991, no writ) (“If unrebutted, [Comptroller's certificates of deficiency] are\nsufficient to establish, as a matter of law, the amount of tax the taxpayer owes.” (citing Baker v.\nBullock, 529 S.W.2d 279, 281 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1975, writ ref'd n.r.e.))). But Ayeni argues\nthat his verified denial of appellee's claims served to rebut or join issue with the Comptroller's\ncertificate, such that its prima facie or presumptive validity effectively disappeared, returning\nappellees to their status quo ante—and leaving appellees lacking in any summary-judgment proof\nto meet their initial burden. We disagree that Ayeni's verified denial had this effect.\n\nAyeni emphasizes subsection (b) of tax code section 111.013, which states:\n\n            The defendant may not deny a claim for taxes, penalties, or interest unless the\n            defendant timely files a sworn written denial that specifically identifies the taxes,\n            penalties, and interest the defendant asserts are not due and the amounts of tax,\n            penalties, and interest that are not due.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   4\n\fAyeni v. State, 440 S.W.3d 707 (2013)\n\n\n\n\nTex. Tax Code Ann. § 111.013(b). Ayeni suggests that subsection (b), read together with\nsubsection (a)'s provisions describing the prima facie effect of the Comptroller's certificate, means\nthat the filing of a verified denial under subsection (b) rebuts or negates the prime facie effect\nof a Comptroller's certificate under subsection (a), much like a verified denial in a suit on sworn\naccount. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 185; Rizk v. Financial Guardian Ins. Agency, Inc., 584 S.W.2d 860,\n862 (Tex.1979) (“It is settled ... that a defendant's verified denial of the correctness of a plaintiff's\nsworn account in the form required by Rule 185 destroys the evidentiary effect of the itemized\naccount attached to the petition and forces the plaintiff to put on proof of his claim.”). However,\nunlike the rules governing suits on sworn accounts, nothing in section 111.013 says that subsection\n(b)'s verified denial has any impact on the operation and effect of subsection (a)'s Comptroller's\ncertificate. Cf. Tex.R. Civ. P. 185 (providing affidavit on sworn account is “prima facie evidence\n[of the account], unless the party resisting such claim shall file a written denial, under oath”). Nor\ncan Ayeni point to any Texas court that has said it does.\n\n *711 Neither subsection (a) or (b) references the other, and we can only conclude that both\nprovisions must be given the effect the Legislature prescribes within each. Subsection (b) is in\nthe nature of a pleading requirement with which defendants in sales-tax deficiency cases must\ncomply in order to join issue with the taxing authority's petition; otherwise, the taxpayer loses by\ndefault. See Noorani Gas & Convenience, Inc. v. State, No. 03–06–00463–CV, 2008 WL 1827605,\nat *5 (Tex.App.-Austin Apr. 24, 2008, no pet) (mem. op.). In contrast, subsection (a) speaks to\nthe evidence on which the taxing authority may rely to meet its burden of proof if and when its\npleadings are placed at issue by a verified denial. And the Legislature in subsection (a) has made\nComptroller's certificates of deficiency prima facie evidence without preconditions. See Tex. Tax\nCode Ann. § 111.013(a). Accordingly, Ayeni's verified denial does not affect the prima facie\nevidentiary nature of the Comptroller's certificate of deficiency in this case. We overrule Ayeni's\nfourth issue on appeal.\n\n\nControverting proof\nBecause appellees attached the Comptroller's certificate of deficiency to their summary-judgment\nmotion and it is sufficient to meet their initial summary-judgment burden, the burden shifted to\nAyeni to raise a question of fact as to the amount of taxes, penalties, and interest he owed for the\naudit period at issue or as to the Comptroller's compliance with the applicable provisions of the tax\ncode in computing and determining the amount due. See id.; N.S. Sportswear, Inc., 819 S.W.2d at\n232. Appellees have urged that Ayeni had to do more than present the legally sufficient contrary\nevidence that is ordinarily required on summary judgment. In their view, Ayeni was required to\nadduce conclusive contrary evidence—i.e., prove as a matter of law that he did not owe the amount\nthe Comptroller certified—in order to preclude summary judgment based on the certification. In\nhis second issue, Ayeni disputes appellees' view of his summary-judgment burden, urging that he\nwas required to present only summary-judgment evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                      5\n\fAyeni v. State, 440 S.W.3d 707 (2013)\n\n\n\nmaterial fact regarding his tax liability, not conclusive evidence. In his first issue, Ayeni argues\nthat his summary-judgment proof is sufficient to raise a fact issue and even rises to the level of\nconclusive contrary evidence.\n\nWe need not address Ayeni's second issue because we conclude that he has not presented\ncompetent evidence sufficient to raise a fact issue even under the customary summary-judgment\nburdens. In an attempt to raise a fact issue, Ayeni submitted his and his bookkeeper's affidavits,\nsales-tax returns for 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and the first quarter of 2010, and various\nreceipts from beer vendors dated between 2004 and 2006. Ayeni's affidavit stated that he did not\nowe the taxes, penalties, and interest claimed by the Comptroller because those amounts were\n“based on incorrect taxable sale amounts.” He then averred that the correct taxable sale amounts\nwere set forth in the sales-tax returns attached to his summary-judgment response. Finally, Ayeni\nstated in his affidavit that the Comptroller incorrectly estimated his beer sales for the audit period\nand that his records showed that he made gross beer purchases of $8,827.11 in 2004, $5,681.99\nin 2005, and $6,622.02 in 2006.\n\nSimilarly, Ayeni's bookkeeper testified in his affidavit that Ayeni did not owe the amounts\nestablished by the Comptroller's certificate of deficiency because those amounts were based on\nincorrect taxable sale amounts. The correct amount of taxes owed, the bookkeeper averred, were\nset forth in the attached sales-tax returns and vendor receipts, which returns the bookkeeper *712\nprepared in the regular course of Ayeni's business. Finally, Ayeni's bookkeeper reiterated Ayeni's\ncontentions regarding the gross purchases of beer made by Ayeni in 2004, 2005, and 2006.\n\n [3] [4] The affidavit testimony that the Comptroller's amounts are incorrect and that Ayeni's\namounts are correct are bare conclusions unsupported by facts. These statements are thus\nincompetent summary-judgment evidence. To be competent summary-judgment evidence, an\naffidavit must contain specific factual bases, admissible in evidence, upon which its conclusions\nare based. Brownlee v. Brownlee, 665 S.W.2d 111, 112 (Tex.1984); see Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(f)\n(affidavits “shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence”). The same is true of\naffidavit assertions that the Comptroller's estimates of his beer sales are incorrect: Although Ayeni\ndoes offer that “his records showed” that he made gross beer purchases of $8,827.11 in 2004,\n$5,681.99 in 2005, and $6,622.02 in 2006” and he includes some of those purchase receipts, he\ndoes not assert that those were his total purchases of taxable items during that period or state with\nany specificity how the Comptroller's numbers were incorrect. More important, Ayeni's affidavits\ndo not state what Ayeni's total sales amounts were for the period at issue, which amounts are,\nby statute, the basis for determining sales tax owed. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 151.051 (West\n2008) (imposing sales tax based on a percentage of sale price). To that extent, even if the affidavits\nwere competent summary-judgment evidence, they do not raise a question of fact as to the correct\namount of sales taxes owed. Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of the appellees was proper.\nWe overrule Ayeni's first issue.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   6\n\fAyeni v. State, 440 S.W.3d 707 (2013)\n\n\n\n\nPartial summary judgment\n [5] In his third issue, Ayeni contends that the district court had no authority to grant a partial\nsummary judgment because the Comptroller did not seek alternative or partial relief in its\nsummary-judgment motion. But rule 166a explicitly permits a trial court to grant a partial summary\njudgment:\n\n   Case not Fully Adjudicated on Motion. If summary judgment is not rendered upon the whole\n   case or for all the relief asked and a trial is necessary, the judge may at the hearing examine the\n   pleadings and the evidence on file, interrogate counsel, ascertain what material fact issues exist\n   and make an order specifying the facts that are established as a matter of law, and directing such\n   further proceedings in the action as are just.\n\nTex.R. Civ. P. 166a(e). Here, the Comptroller sought summary judgment on two claims—\na claim seeking delinquent sales taxes owed and a claim for attorney's fees—but the district\ncourt determined that the Comptroller met its summary-judgment burden only as to its claim\nfor sales taxes owed and not as to its claim for attorney's fees. Accordingly, under rule 166a,\nit was appropriate for the district court to grant a partial summary judgment on the claim for\nsales tax owed and deny the Comptroller's motion as to attorney's fees. See Pinnacle Anesthesia\nConsultants, P.A. v. Fisher, 309 S.W.3d 93, 100 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2009, pet. denied) (“If a case\nis not fully adjudicated on a motion for summary judgment, the trial court is authorized to render\npartial summary judgment, making ‘an order specifying the facts that are established as a matter\nof law, and directing such further proceedings in the action as are just’ ”) quoting Tex.R. Civ.\nP. 166a(e))).\n\nAyeni also suggests that the district court improperly granted partial summary judgment on no-\nevidence grounds. But there is nothing in the district court's order suggesting that the “partial”\naspect of the summary judgment was a reference to *713 the traditional versus no-evidence\nstandard, as opposed to the claims being addressed.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule Ayeni's third issue on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the district court's judgment.\n\n\n\nJustice HENSON Not Participating.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

State, 440 S.W.3d 707 (2013)\n\n\n\n\nConcurring Opinion by Justice PEMBERTON.\n\nBOB PEMBERTON, Justice, concurring.\nAlthough I join in the majority's opinion and judgment—I wrote them, after all—I write separately\nto offer some additional observations about Ayeni's second issue. While it was ultimately\nunnecessary for us to reach that issue here, it nonetheless warrants emphasis that Ayeni has\nidentified an aberration in this Court's past jurisprudence addressing the effect of Comptroller\ncertificates of deficiency and how a taxpayer can oppose a summary-judgment motion predicated\non one.\n\nThe notion that a taxpayer must present conclusive contrary evidence to rebut a Comptroller's\ncertificate of deficiency does not find explicit textual support in the current tax code. Subsection\n(a) of section 111.013 states only that the Comptroller's certificate is “prima facie evidence” of\nthe taxes, penalties, and interest due, the delinquency of those amounts, and of the comptroller's\ncompliance with the tax code. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 111.013(a) (West 2008). “Prima facie” is\nLatin for “first view,” 1 and “prima facie evidence” typically denotes evidence that is determinative\nof a fact's or facts' existence, sometimes stated in terms of giving rise to a “presumption” of their\nexistence, unless and until some contrary evidence is presented. See Coward v. Gateway Nat'l\nBank of Beaumont, 525 S.W.2d 857, 859 (Tex.1975); Dodson v. Watson, 110 Tex. 355, 220 S.W.\n771, 772 (1920) ( “Prima facie evidence is merely that which suffices for the proof of a particular\nfact until contradicted and overcome by other evidence.”); Black's Law Dictionary 638–39 (9th\ned.2009) (defining “prima facie evidence” as “[e]vidence that will establish a fact or sustain a\njudgment unless contrary evidence is produced”). 2 But nothing in section 111.013 purports to\nrequire conclusive contrary evidence to rebut or join issue with a Comptroller's certificate. See\nTex. Tax Code Ann. § 111.013.\n\nAppellees rely less on the tax code than on precedents of this Court, and I must concede they find\nsome support there. As best I can tell, these decisions trace back to a 1967 no-writ case involving a\ntrial on the merits of a tax-deficiency claim, Smith v. State, 418 S.W.2d 893 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin\n1967, no writ). Smith, in turn, purported to rely on the analysis in a 1942 Texas Supreme Court\nopinion, Southland Life Insurance Co. v. Greenwade, 138 Tex. 450, 159 S.W.2d 854 (1942). 3\nSouthland Life addressed the nature and application *714 of the presumption of receipt afforded\na properly stamped, addressed, and mailed letter in the context of a suit by a life-insurance\nbeneficiary to recover policy proceeds. See id. at 858. The defendant insurance carrier asserted\nthat the decedent's life-insurance policy had lapsed prior to the insured's death due to the insured's\nfailure to make a premium payment that had come due. The case went to trial, at which the plaintiff\nbeneficiary presented detailed evidence that the decedent had properly stamped, addressed, and\nmailed the premium payment to the insurance company prior to its final due date.

State, 440 S.W.3d 707 (2013)\n\n\n\nat 857 (“It is settled in this state, however, that when a letter properly addressed and with postage\nprepaid is mailed, a presumption of fact (rebuttable of course) arises that it was duly received by\nthe addressee.”). In response, the insurance company presented evidence that it had not received\nthe premium payment. Id. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff beneficiary.\n\nOn appeal to the Waco Court of Civil Appeals, the insurance company asserted, among other\npoints, that the evidence did not support a finding that the premium payment had been timely\npaid. See Southland Life Ins. Co. v. Greenwade, 143 S.W.2d 648, 650–51 (Tex.Civ.App.-Waco\n1940), reversed by 159 S.W.2d at 858. Specifically, the insurance company argued that because it\nhad produced evidence that it had never actually received the premium, both the presumption of\nreceipt and the foundational evidence supporting that presumption—i.e., that the payment letter\nhad been properly stamped, addressed, and mailed to the company—“disappeared” such that the\ntrier of fact could no longer consider it; thus leaving the plaintiff without any proof of receipt. See\nid. at 650. The Waco court overruled that issue, holding that even in the face of evidence of non-\nreceipt, the presumption of receipt “continued as evidence” that was sufficient to support the trial\ncourt's judgment. See id. at 650.\n\nOn appeal, although ultimately affirming the trial court's judgment and holding that the evidence\nwas sufficient to support a finding that the premium check had been timely received, the supreme\ncourt explicitly rejected the Waco court's view that a presumption like that of receipt could itself\nbe considered evidence. Instead, the supreme court held that a presumption is not evidence and\nthat it disappears once “substantial contrary evidence” is offered by the party against whom the\npresumption operates. See Southland Life, 159 S.W.2d at 857 (citing Wigmore on Evidence, 2d\ned., § 2491); see also General Motors Corp. v. Saenz, 873 S.W.2d 353, 359 (Tex.1993) (“Once ...\nevidence contradicting the presumption has been offered, the presumption disappears.”). But the\ncourt then went on to clarify that the evidence that gave rise to the presumption could still be\nconsidered and weighed by the fact-finder, vis-à-vis the carrier's contrary evidence, as evidence\nthat the premium payment had, in fact, been timely received. Southland Life, 159 S.W.2d at\n857; see Saenz, 873 S.W.2d at 359. In other words, although the insurance company had offered\nevidence that it had not timely received the payment, thus eliminating the presumption of receipt,\nthe trier of fact could still consider the facts underlying the presumption-i.e., that the defendant\nstamped, addressed, and mailed the payment letter to the company-as themselves *715 evidence\nthat the insurance company received the payment. See Southland Life, 159 S.W.2d at 857. And,\nrelying on this evidence of payment, the supreme court went on to hold that the evidence was\nsufficient to support the trial court's finding that the payment was timely received. See id.\n\nThe court in Southland Life then went on to observe that there might be circumstances where the\npresumption's foundational facts could not be considered—i.e., would not support an affirmative\nfinding—by the trier of fact:\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

State, 440 S.W.3d 707 (2013)\n\n\n\n\n            We hold that an inference established prima facie (as in the present case) is\n            overcome, together with the evidentiary facts tending to establish it, only when\n            the evidence tending to support the contrary inference is conclusive, or so clear,\n            positive and disinterested that it would be unreasonable not to give effect to\n            it as conclusive.... [P]rima facie evidence and presumptions of fact disappear\n            when the true facts are conclusively shown by other evidence. ... In other words,\n            presumptions, when controverted by facts, disappear, as such, and cannot be\n            weighed as evidence against such facts.\n\nId. at 858 (internal citations omitted) (emphases in original). In other words, if the party against\nwhom the presumption of receipt operates presents evidence that conclusively negates receipt\nof the mail, both the presumption of receipt and the probative value of any proof of underlying\nfacts could be said to “disappear” because the evidence, by definition, is legally insufficient to\nsupport a finding of receipt. This amounts merely to an observation about the nature of conclusive\nevidence that negates a fact's existence. See City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 810\n(Tex.2005) (discussing conclusive contrary evidence and noting that “ ‘[n]o evidence points must,\nand may only, be sustained when the record discloses [that] the evidence establishes conclusively\nthe opposite of the vital fact’ ” (quoting Robert W. Calvert, “No Evidence” and “Insufficient\nEvidence” Points of Error, 38 Tex. L.Rev. 361 (1960)).\n\nIn Smith, this Court, citing Southland Life, described a taxpayer's burden in opposing the presumed\ncorrectness of a Comptroller's certificate of deficiency at trial as follows:\n\n            With the prima facie presumption established that the State's claim for\n            admissions taxes 4 against [the owner of a business on the taxpayer's property]\n            was as shown in the Comptroller's certificate under Article 1.08 5 , appellant\n            [taxpayer] had the burden to overcome the inference with such evidence tending\n            to support the contrary as would be conclusive, or evidence so clear and positive\n            it would be unreasonable not to give effect to it as conclusive.\n\nSmith, 418 S.W.2d at 896 (citing Southland Life, 159 S.W.2d at 858). This Court has continued to\ndescribe the taxpayer's burden at trial in similar terms. 6 To the *716 extent such descriptions refer\nto the concepts that a Comptroller's certificate, even if met with the taxpayer's contrary evidence,\nmay nonetheless be legally sufficient to support a fact finding of tax liability unless the taxpayer's\ncontrary evidence is conclusive, it is merely an application of the principles described in Southland\nLife. In any event, Ayeni does not quarrel with the notion that he would be required, at least\npractically speaking, to present conclusive contrary evidence in order to overcome the effect of a\nComptroller's certificate at trial on the merits. Otherwise, under the Southland Life analysis, the\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 10\n\fAyeni v. State, 440 S.W.3d 707 (2013)\n\n\n\ncertificate would remain as legally sufficient evidence that could potentially support fact findings\nagainst the taxpayer.\n\nBut it is quite another thing, Ayeni urges, to hold that a nonmovant must present conclusive\ncontrary evidence to preclude summary judgment based on a Comptroller's certificate, as appellees\nargue here. I agree.\n\nThe notion that a taxpayer nonmovant must counter a Comptroller's certificate with conclusive\ncontrary evidence in order to preclude summary judgment traces back to a 2004 memorandum\nopinion of this Court, Wimmer v. State, No. 03–03–00135–CV, 2004 WL 210629, at *3–4\n(Tex.App.-Austin Feb. 5, 2004, pet. denied) (mem. op.). In Wimmer, we held that a taxpayer\n“must conclusively establish that he owes no tax” to overcome a summary judgment predicated\non a Comptroller's certificate of deficiency. See id. at *3. For support, this Court cited Smith\nand its progeny-again, cases that involved trials on the merits. See id. at *3–4 (citing Sundown\nFarms, 89 S.W.3d 291, 293 (Tex.App.-Austin 2002, no pet.); Hylton v. State, 665 S.W.2d 571,\n572 (Tex.App.-Austin 1984, no writ); Smith, 418 S.W.2d at 893). There was zero explanation\nor analysis of whether or how those concepts should properly be applied in the vastly different\nprocedural context of summary judgment. See Wimmer, 2004 WL 210629 at *3–4. 7\n\nContrary to the holdings of Wimmer, and any progeny, their analytical cornerstone in Southland\nLife would imply that the contrary evidence used to rebut the presumption, even if not conclusive,\nwould raise a fact issue that would have to be resolved by the fact finder and not by summary\njudgment. See Southland Life, 159 S.W.2d at 857; see also Balawajder v. Texas Dep't of Criminal\nJustice Inst. Div., 217 S.W.3d 20, 27 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, pet. denied) (“In\nthe context of a summary judgment, the party against whom the presumption operates must\nproduce evidence sufficient ‘to neutralize the effect of the presumption’ for the case to proceed to\ntrial.” quoting Amaye v. Oravetz, 57 S.W.3d 581, 584 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet.\ndenied)); First Nat'l Bank of Libby, Montana v. Rector, 710 S.W.2d 100, 103 (Tex.App.-Austin\n1986, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (holding that where document created presumption of foreign judgment's\nvalidity, the party against whom the presumption operates must “produce some evidence at least\nraising an issue of material fact as to the validity” of the judgment to defeat summary judgment).\nAnd Wimmer, and any subsequent cases that might have followed it, are at odds with the summary-\njudgment burdens that the Texas Supreme Court has prescribed. Even if it is in some sense correct\nto state that a taxpayer must overcome a Comptroller's *717 certificate with conclusive evidence\nat trial on the merits, the supreme court has made it clear that nonmovants do not face higher\nor different summary-judgment burdens based on the burdens of proof they may face at trial:\n“The failure of one party in a hearing upon a motion for summary judgment to discharge the\nburden which would rest on him at a trial on the merits is no ground for a summary judgment\nin favor of the other party.” Tigner v. First Nat'l Bank of Angleton, 153 Tex. 69, 264 S.W.2d\n85, 87 (1954). It has likewise made clear that a movant's summary-judgment burden does not\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               11\n\fAyeni v. State, 440 S.W.3d 707 (2013)\n\n\n\ndepend on its burden of proof at trial: “The presumptions and burden of proof for an ordinary or\nconventional trial are immaterial to the burden that a movant for summary judgment must bear.”\nMissouri–Kan.–Tex.R.R. Co. v. City of Dallas, 623 S.W.2d 296, 298 (Tex.1981) (citing Tigner,\n264 S.W.2d at 87). In fact, the supreme court held in Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad that the\ntaxing authority, which enjoyed a number of presumptions in its favor, including that its property\nvaluations were valid, must nevertheless “ ‘establish [its] entitlement to a summary judgment on\nthe issues expressly presented to the trial court by conclusively proving all essential elements of\n[its] cause of action or defense as a matter of law.’ ” Id. (quoting City of Houston v. Clear Creek\nBasin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex.1979)). Thus, even if the taxpayer's burden of proof at\ntrial requires him to produce conclusive evidence to prevail on the merits, he must only produce\nevidence sufficient to raise a question of fact as to the taxing authority's claim in order to avoid\nsummary judgment.\n\nNonetheless, because Ayeni has not presented competent contrary summary-judgment evidence\nthat would even meet the customary burden of a summary-judgment nonmovant, this is not the\ncase in which this Court should undertake to reexamine the suspect holdings of Wimmer and any\nprogeny en banc. 8 But that case will come along inevitably, so I leave this writing as a place\nmarker for that day. Alternatively, the Legislature could, of course, provide statutory clarification\nthat would obviate the need for any such reexamination.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Cf. Tex.

Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d 834 (1982)\n\n\n\nThis is a breach of contract case. The principal issue on appeal is whether a provision in the written\ncontract in question should be construed as a liquidated damage provision or whether it is a penalty\nprovision which may not be enforced by appellant as liquidated damages. Other points of error\nasserted by appellant William J. Bethel, Jr. d/b/a Ra-Comm Electronics relating to attorney's fees\nand pre-judgment interest and cross points by appellee Butler Drilling Corporation are discussed\nbelow. We reform the judgment of the trial court to provide for pre-judgment interest from October\n1, 1977, on the sum of $10,189.72, and otherwise affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nThe appellant was originally engaged by Butler Drilling Company to perform certain motor vehicle\nradio maintenance and repair duties for appellee. From 1967 to 1974 appellant operated under\nan oral month to month agreement. By contract dated August 28, 1974, appellant and Butler\nDrilling Company entered into a written contract to perform such motor vehicle radio repairs and\nmaintenance on a twenty-four hour on-call basis. The services provided for under the contract were\nexclusive as to appellee but non-exclusive as to appellant. The contract was signed by appellant\nWilliam J. Bethel, Jr., and for Butler Drilling Company was signed by its president, Duncan Butler,\nwith a notary acknowledgment also dated August 28, 1974. On October 1, 1974, Butler Drilling\nCompany sold its assets to Mitchell Energy Corporation and Butler Drilling Corporation became\nthe successor corporation. Duncan Butler also served as president of the successor corporation. The\ncontract provided that employment of appellant would continue for a period of three consecutive\nyears beginning September 1, 1974, and ending August 31, 1977. Appellant would be paid in\nspecified semi-monthly installments with the amount of such payments to increase yearly in\nspecified sums. Additional labor performed by appellant would be billed and paid for at an hourly\nrate of $10 per hour. Appellee agreed to provide either a vehicle or travel reimbursement to\nappellant as well as shop space, utilities and parking facilities. Appellee further agreed to furnish\nall repair and replacement parts; appellant was to purchase these parts and bill appellee monthly\nfor them at cost plus fifteen percent. The contract contained the following *837 provisions which\nrelate to the liquidated damages claimed by appellant in this appeal:\n\n            “Because the services to be performed by Ra-Comm are personal services, the\n            death of William J. Bethel, Jr., or such bad health or accident as shall render him\n            unable to fully perform said services, shall be grounds to relieve both parties\n            from any further obligations concerning the contract. In the event that Butler\n            breaches the contract and fails to perform for any reasons other than those set\n            out above, then it shall pay as liquidated damages to Ra-Comm the balance of\n            the monthly installment payments set out above.”\n\nIt was undisputed the contract was terminated by appellee on October 24, 1975, but there was a\ndispute as to whether such termination was with or without good cause. The jury found in answer\nto special issues that Butler Drilling Corporation assumed and ratified appellant's contract with\nButler Drilling Company, that appellant was an independent contractor from October 1, 1974 to\nOctober 24, 1975, that appellant was terminated, that Butler Drilling Corporation did not have\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d 834 (1982)\n\n\n\ngood cause to terminate appellant, that Duncan Butler was authorized by Butler Drilling Company\nto enter into the contract, that $14,500 would reasonably and fairly compensate appellant for the\ntermination of the contract, that Butler Drilling Corporation did not convert any of appellant's\npersonal property on or about October 24, 1975, that appellant did not furnish Butler Drilling\nCorporation any equipment for which he was not paid, that reasonable attorney's fee for appellant's\nattorneys was $12,000, and that appellant did not convert assets of Butler Drilling Corporation to\nhis own use. The court on appellee's Motion disregarded the jury finding that appellant did not\nconvert any of appellee's assets and rendered final judgment in favor of appellant for $10,189.72\nby taking the jury's damage answer of $14,500.00 and subtracting the conversion offset admitted\nby appellant in the amount of $4,310.28.\n\nThe court also awarded $12,000.00 in attorney's fees on the jury finding, and denied appellant's\nMotion for Judgment on attorney's fees of $16,500.00. The court further refused appellant's Motion\nfor Judgment for liquidated damages of $41,825.00 and pre-judgment interest on the liquidated\nsum. From this final judgment appellant appeals.\n\nAppellant's seven points of error are that the trial court erred in denying appellant's Motion for\nJudgment for liquidated damages provided by the contract and that there was no evidence and\ninsufficient evidence to prove the liquidated damage clause was a penalty; that the trial court erred\nin denying appellant's Motion for Judgment for $16,500.00 attorney's fees and that there was no\nevidence and insufficient evidence to support the jury finding of $12,000.00 attorney's fees; and\nthat the trial court erred in not awarding pre-judgment interest from January 1, 1976.\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] With respect to appellant's first three points of error, we construe the\nlanguage employed in the contract in question to be a penalty, as a matter of law as pleaded by\nthe appellee in its trial pleading, and as construed by the trial court, rather than a valid liquidated\ndamage provision as contended by appellant. The liquidated damage provision is not triggered\nsolely by contract termination and nonpayment of monthly rentals by Butler. The liquidated\ndamage provision was not carefully drawn and as it was written, it applied equally to any breach of\nany provision of the contract by appellee irrespective of the importance or triviality of such breach.\nThe liquidated damage provision of the contract in question, as written, would apply with equal\nforce for such trivial breaches by appellee Butler as failing to pay utilities, provide parking space\nor pay an additional hourly labor charge of $10.00. Under the liquidated damage clause as written,\nappellant would be entitled to the full amount of monthly payments for the full term of the contract\nirrespective of the nature of the breach or appellant's actual loss or damage. Because the contract\nprovides the same reparation *838 for the breach of a trivial or comparatively unimportant\nstipulation as for the breach of the most important one or of the whole contract, we hold that the\nparties have not adhered to the rule of just compensation and that the provision is a penalty. The\nleading case on the subject is Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 668, 245 S.W.2d 484 (Tex.1952),\nwhich involved a building lease providing for monthly rentals of $325.00 per month. Prior to the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  3\n\fBethel v. Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d 834 (1982)\n\n\n\ncompletion of the lease term, the lessee vacated the building and failed to pay the monthly rentals\nas provided in the written contract. The lease contract of the parties included a liquidated damage\nprovision that provided “(t)he failure of Lessee to make said payment or payments or the breach\nof this contract otherwise by him shall render him liable to Lessors, as agreed liquidated damages,\nthe sum of One Hundred Fifty ($150) Dollars per month for each and every month of the unexpired\nterm...” (Emphasis added.) Stewart v. Basey, supra at 485. In holding that such stipulated damage\nprovision would be treated as a penalty the Texas Supreme Court pointed out that the liquidated\ndamage provision was not carefully drawn and was not limited to the breach of any one particular\ncovenant, but rather provided for the same reparation for the breach of a trivial or comparatively\nunimportant stipulation as for the breach of the most important one of the contract. Therefore, the\nSupreme Court reasoned, the provision did not adhere to the rule of just compensation. The court\nthen reversed and remanded the case to determine the amount of actual damages to which lessor\nwas entitled for the breach. The court emphasized that damages to be enforceable as liquidated\ndamages must be uncertain and the stipulation must be reasonable. The right of competent parties\nto make their own bargains is not unlimited. The universal rule for measuring damages for the\nbreach of a contract is just compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained. A party has no\nright to have a court enforce a stipulation which violates the principle underlying the rule. Again,\nthe Supreme Court in Stewart v. Basey, supra, at 486, stated:\n\n   “The true theory is well expressed in Williston on Contracts, Revised Edition, Sec. 779, p.\n   2192, in this language: ‘But as has been seen, the chief, almost the only, means of determining\n   whether the parties in good faith endeavored to assess the damages is afforded by the amount\n   of damages stipulated for, and the nature of the breach upon which the stipulation was agreed\n   to become operative...’ ”\n\nFinally, the Supreme Court quoted from the comments from Restatement of Contracts, Sec. 339,\nsubsection (1) as follows:\n\n            “b. Contracts are frequently made in which performance of very different\n            degrees of importance and value are promised and one large sum of money\n            is made payable as damages for any breach whatever. Since such a contract\n            promises the same reparation for the breach of a trivial or comparatively\n            unimportant stipulation as for the breach of the most important one or of\n            the whole contract, it is obvious the parties have not adhered to the rule of\n            just compensation. In this matter neither the intention of the parties nor their\n            expression of intention is the governing consideration. The payment promised\n            may be a penalty, though described expressly as liquidated damages, and vice\n            versa.”\n\nAppellant here urges that the liquidated damage provision in the contract in question should be\nenforced in this case because of the contract termination by appellee without good cause and\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 4\n\fBethel v. Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d 834 (1982)\n\n\n\nhis nonpayment of monthly rentals, but that it should not be enforced for trivial breaches of the\ncontract. We recognize it is a stringent case on the facts from appellant's viewpoint, but we do not\nbelieve that we are empowered to pick and choose which breaches are enforceable by liquidated\ndamages since the provision plainly states it is applicable to all breaches of the contract and the\nSupreme Court in Stewart v. Basey has so directly spoken. Further, if there is any doubt on the\nquestion under the language of the instrument, that doubt must be resolved against appellant who\nprepared the instrument. *839 American Lease Plan v. Ben-Kro Corporation, 508 S.W.2d 937,\n942 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston (1st Dist.) 1974, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Another similar case in point is\nKrenek v. Wang Laboratories, Inc., 583 S.W.2d 454 (Tex.Civ.App.-Waco 1979, no writ) where\nthe lessor brought action against lessee for failure to make monthly payments under an equipment\nlease and sought to recover liquidated damages as provided in the contract. The Waco Court, in\nreversing the trial court, followed Stewart v. Basey, supra, and held the provision was a penalty\nbecause it could be triggered by a breach of lesser covenants in the lease and not just by a breach of\na major covenant such as nonpayment of rentals. Still another case in point is Servisco v. Tramco,\nInc., 568 S.W.2d 434 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.) which relied on Stewart\nv. Basey, supra, and distinguished a case relied upon by appellant in the instant case, Oetting v.\nFlake Uniform and Linen Service, 553 S.W.2d 793 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth 1977, no writ).\n\nAppellant relies principally on Oetting v. Flake Uniform & Linen Service, supra. That case is\ndistinguishable from the instant case because as the Fort Worth Court specifically pointed out at\npage 796 of the opinion, the liquidated damage provision in that case could be triggered only by\nthe failure of the customer to pay the monthly service charge and the termination of the contract\nby the supplier because of nonpayment by the customer. The Fort Worth Court pointed out that\nthe liquidated damage clause as written could not be triggered by any lesser breaches, but could\nonly be triggered by the most major breach of all, nonpayment. Appellant also cites Johnson\nEngineers, Inc. v. Tri-Water Supply Corporation, 582 S.W.2d 555 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana\n1979, no writ) and R.M. Robinson v. Granite Equipment Leasing Corporation, 553 S.W.2d 633\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Houston (1st Dist.) 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.). In Johnson Engineers Inc., v. Tri-Water\nSupply Corporation, supra, which was a suit for payment under a construction contract, liquidated\ndamages were pled as an offset to cover the period of delay beyond the agreed completion date\nof the contract. There was no defensive pleading that the liquidated damage provision was a\npenalty, as was done in the instant case, and there was no evidence of actual damages to show\nany disproportionate amount of actual damages to stipulated damages. More importantly, the\nliquidated damage clause did not apply to major and trivial covenants under the contract, but\napplied only to the payment of $100.00 per day for each day of delay by the appellant after\nthe allotted construction time under the contract. R.M. Robinson v. Granite Equipment Leasing\nCorporation, supra, was a nonjury trial for liquidated damages by reason of defendant-lessee's\ndefault of monthly payments under a personal property lease. The liquidated damage provision\nrequiring payment of all unaccrued rentals was triggered only by the defendant-lessee's default in\ntimely payment of such monthly rentals, and not by any breach of any minor or trivial covenant\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   5\n\fBethel v. Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d 834 (1982)\n\n\n\nin the lease. Further, there was no defensive pleading that it was a penalty and such defense was\nwaived. Appellant's first three points of error are overruled.\n\n [6] [7] Appellant contends by his next three points of error that the trial court erred in denying\nappellant's Motion for Judgment for attorney's fees in the amount of $16,500 and allowing only\n$12,000 attorney's fees on the jury finding, because there was no evidence or insufficient evidence\nto support such finding. Appellant's trial attorney testified that he was familiar with fees charged\nfor services similar to those rendered in this case and that “it is my opinion that ... a proper legal fee\nand reasonable fee for the same or similar circumstances in Harris County would be approximately\n$16,500.” There was no cross-examination of the witness nor was there any contradictory attorney\nfee expert opinion evidence produced by appellee. The jury found $12,000 would be a reasonable\nattorney's fee. Appellant recognizes the unbroken long line of case authority holding that the\namount of attorney's fees is a fact issue even when no contradictory evidence is offered. Further,\nthe trier of fact may determine the credibility of the witness *840 and accept or reject his expert\nopinion testimony in whole or in part. However, appellant urges such authority was changed\nby the June 6, 1979, amendment to Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2226 (Vernon Supp.1981) which\nprovided:\n\n   “... The usual and customary fees in such cases shall be presumed to be reasonable, but such\n   presumption may be rebutted by competent evidence...” (Emphasis added).\n\nThe amendment further provides the act is to be liberally construed to promote its underlying\npurposes. In addition, it is remedial in nature and is intended to apply to all pending and future\nactions regardless of the time of institution or of the accrual of any cause of action asserted.\nThus, the 1979 amendment applies to the instant case. Appellant contends the presumption found\nin Article 2226, as amended, mandates and makes conclusive an award of attorney's fees in the\namount testified to by appellant's counsel in the absence of contradictory evidence. No cases have\nbeen cited to us by the parties nor have we found any construing the effect or meaning of this\npresumption since the 1979 amendments. Appellee cites two cases, Law Offices of James R.\nBass, Inc. v. Bryan, 609 S.W.2d 652 (Tex.Civ.App.-San Antonio 1980, no writ), and Graves v.\nSommerfeld, 618 S.W.2d 952 (Tex.Civ.App.-Waco 1981, no writ). Both of these cases hold the\nissue of amount of attorney's fees is a fact issue, but neither case discusses the 1979 amendment,\nand it is not shown from the opinions whether the cases were tried before or after the effective\ndate of the 1979 amendments. See also: Neal v. Neal, 606 S.W.2d 729 (Tex.Civ.App.-Beaumont\n1980, no writ) to the same effect.\n\nA look at the legislative history relating to the presumptions on attorney's fees under Article 2226 is\nhelpful. In 1971, the 62nd Legislature amended Article 2226 to provide the then current State Bar\nMinimum Fee Schedule shall be prima facie evidence of reasonable attorney's fees, and in nonjury\ncases the court may take judicial knowledge of the minimum fee schedule and of the contents of the\ncase file in determining the amount of attorneys fees without hearing further evidence. The cases\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    6\n\fBethel v. Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d 834 (1982)\n\n\n\nfollowing that amendment uniformly held that the bar fee schedule was not conclusive even in the\nabsence of contradictory proof but was only prima facie evidence of reasonable attorney's fees.\nAztec Pipe and Supply Company Inc. v. Sundance Oil Company, 568 S.W.2d 401 (Tex.Civ.App.\nHouston (1st Dist.) 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Also, opinion testimony as to the value of services\nwas held not conclusive, and in jury cases if reliance was not made on the bar fee schedule, there\nhad to be evidence of the reasonableness of attorney's fees to support such an award. Dorsey\nv. Aguirre, 552 S.W.2d 576 (Tex.Civ.App.-Waco 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.). In summary judgment\ncases, the courts also uniformly held there could be no summary judgment as to the amount of\nreasonable attorney's fees because the uncontradicted opinion of an expert was only an opinion,\nthereby raising only a fact issue on the amount. McFadden v. Bresler Malls Inc., 526 S.W.2d 258\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1975, no writ), appeal after remand, 548 S.W.2d 789 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin\n1975, no writ); Coward v. Gateway National Bank of Beaumont, 525 S.W.2d 857 (Tex.1975).\n\nEffective January 1, 1978, however, Tex.R.Civ.P. 166-A was amended to provide that a Summary\nJudgment may be based on uncontroverted testimonial evidence of an expert witness as to subject\nmatter concerning which the trier of fact must be guided solely by the opinion testimony of\nexperts-if the evidence is clear, positive and direct, otherwise credible and free from contradictions\nand inconsistencies and could have been easily controverted. Thus, it became possible to obtain\na Summary Judgment on the issue of reasonable attorney's fees on the basis of uncontradicted\nSummary Judgment evidence. Bado Equipment Co., Inc. v. Ryder Truck Lines Inc., d/b/a Ranger\nDivision, 612 S.W.2d 81, 83 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston (14th Dist.) 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\nEffective August 29, 1977, the 65th Legislature deleted the provision in Art. 2226 *841 which\nhad provided that the State Bar Minimum Fee Schedule shall be prima facie evidence of reasonable\nattorney's fees and that the court in a nonjury case may take judicial knowledge of the schedule\nand the contents of the case file in determining the amount of reasonable attorney's fees without\nfurther evidence. That deletion was prompted by the United States Supreme Court decision in\nGoldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S.Ct. 2004, 44 L.Ed.2d 572 (1975). Thereafter,\nin every case positive proof by opinion testimony of reasonableness was required to support the\naward of attorney's fees in a jury or nonjury trial. In the absence of testimony that such fees were\nreasonable, no such attorney's fees were recoverable. Brown v. De La Garza Service Center, Inc.,\n576 S.W.2d 134 (Tex.Civ.App.-Waco 1978, no writ).\n\nFinally, the 66th Legislature, effective June 6, 1979, amended the current Article 2226 to provide\nthat usual and customary fees in such cases shall be presumed to be reasonable, and also added that\nin a jury or nonjury case if the issue of attorney's fees is submitted to the court for determination,\nthe court may in its discretion take judicial knowledge of the usual and customary fees in such\nmatters and of the contents of the case file without receiving further evidence. This raises the\nquestion of whether the reasonableness of such an unrebutted presumption of usual and customary\nfees under the 1979 amendment should be treated differently than the 1971 prima facie evidence\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   7\n\fBethel v. Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d 834 (1982)\n\n\n\nprovision of reasonableness under the State Bar Minimum Fee Schedule in a trial on the merits.\nShould it be treated as a true presumption which entitles one to an instructed verdict in the absence\nof evidence to the contrary? Farley v. M M Cattle Company, 529 S.W.2d 751, 756 (Tex.1975);\nSudduth v. Commonwealth County Mutual Ins. Co., 454 S.W.2d 196, 198 (Tex.1970).\n\n [8] [9] [10] We hold that Article 2226, as amended, does not render conclusive and mandatory\nthe award of a specific sum of attorney's fees based on uncontradicted expert opinion evidence\nof reasonableness or uncontradicted evidence of “usual and customary fees.” We believe the\neffect of the statute is to presumptively provide the element of “reasonableness” of attorney's fees\nwhere there is uncontradicted testimony of what “the usual and customary fees” are and that such\nevidence will support an award up to that amount, but that such evidence is not conclusive and\nmandatory. Where the issue of attorney's fees is determined by the court, whether it is a jury\nor nonjury case, the court is authorized to take judicial notice of what the usual and customary\nfees are in such matters and of the contents of the case file without hearing further evidence. We\ndo not believe this means, or that it was intended, that, the court, having taken judicial notice\nof “usual and customary fees,” is mandated to award that specific amount in every instance.\nRather, we think the court is authorized to make an award up to that amount. Neither do we\nbelieve the statute mandates the award of a specific sum in a jury or nonjury case where there is\nunrebutted direct testimony of “the usual and customary fees,” or of unrebutted opinion testimony\nof “reasonable attorneys fees” whether or not they are the usual and customary fees. Under the\ncurrent provisions of Tex.R.Civ.P. 166-A, the court may render summary judgment on attorney's\nfees if the affidavit or other summary judgment evidence meets the clear, positive, direct and\nuncontradicted requirements of that rule. On the other hand, as stated above, we do not believe\nTex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2226 (Vernon Supp.1981) makes conclusive or mandatory in a trial\non the merits the award of a specific sum based on uncontradicted evidence of “the usual and\ncustomary fees.” This holding and interpretation will reconcile the range of possible attorney's fee\nawards in cases where there is uncontradicted evidence of “the usual and customary fees,” with the\ncases where there may be no evidence of “usual and customary fees” but there is uncontradicted\nopinion evidence of “reasonableness” of attorney's fees. Also, this view of the meaning and\napplication of Art. 2226 would apply equally to a default judgment situation where there is always\n *842 uncontradicted oral testimony or uncontradicted affidavit proof on attorney's fees. We do\nnot believe Art. 2226 was intended to render conclusive or mandate a specific award of attorney's\nfees in default judgment situations.\n\n [11] If the Legislature had intended uncontradicted opinion evidence on reasonableness of\nattorney's fees or uncontradicted evidence of “usual and customary” fees to be conclusive and\nmandate the award of a specific sum, it could easily have so stated. In the absence of such a clear\nstatement, we do not believe the Legislature so intended. The previous amendments all appear\nto relate to the question of supplying the element of “reasonableness” and of prima facie proof,\nand we believe this is also the thrust of the June 6, 1979, amendment. We hold Article 2226, as\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  8\n\fBethel v. Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d 834 (1982)\n\n\n\namended, and the state of the evidence does not mandate the award of $16,500.00 attorney's fees\nin the instant case and that the jury answer of $12,000.00 was authorized and supported by the\nevidence.\n\nAdditionally, in the case at bar, the opinion of appellant's trial attorney on attorney's fees was not\ncouched in terms of “the usual and customary fees” which is the language used in Article 2226 to\ninvoke the presumption of reasonableness. Further, the attorney's opinion testimony of the amount\nwas not clear, direct and positive. The appellant's trial attorney opined that a reasonable fee for\nthese services would be “approximately $16,500.00.” The uncontradicted evidence did not indicate\nwhat “the usual and customary fees” were, but rather supplied the element of “reasonableness”\nand stated a reasonable fee would be approximately $16,500.00. Appellant's points of error four,\nfive and six are overruled.\n\n [12] [13] [14] [15] Appellant's seventh point of error contends the trial court erred in denying\n6% pre-judgment interest from January 1, 1976, under the provisions of Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann.\nart. 5069-1.03 (Vernon Supp.1981). That statute provides:\n\n            “When no specified rate of interest is agreed upon by the parties, interest at the\n            rate of six percent per annum shall be allowed on all accounts and contracts\n            ascertaining the sum payable, commencing on the thirtieth (30th) day from and\n            after the time when the sum is due and payable.”\n\nWhere pre-judgment interest is sought on the basis of a written contract fitting the description of\nArticle 5069-1.03 an award of this statutory interest, or interest eo nomine as it is known, may\nbe supported by a prayer for general relief. See e.g., The Republic National Bank of Dallas v.\nNorthwest National Bank of Fort Worth, 578 S.W.2d 109 (Tex.1978) (allowing pre-judgment\ninterest on a letter of credit), and Miner-Dederick Construction Corporation v. Mid-County\nRental Service, Inc., 603 S.W.2d 193 (Tex.1980) (allowing pre-judgment interest on construction\ncontracts). It is distinguished from a situation where pre-judgment interest is sought at common\nlaw as an element of damages, in which case the plaintiff must have a pleading to support pre-\njudgment interest. Black Lake Pipe Line Company v. Union Construction Company, Inc., 538\nS.W.2d 80 (Tex.1976) (quantum meruit under a construction contracts); Pickett v. J. J. Willis\nTrucking Company, 624 S.W.2d 664 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston (14th Dist.) 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.);\nZuider Zee Oyster Bar, Inc. v.

In either case, pre-judgment interest is recoverable as a matter of right where an\nascertainable sum of money is determined to have been due and payable at a date certain prior\nto judgment.

Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d 834 (1982)\n\n\n\nWorth, supra. Appellant did not have a specific pleading for pre-judgment interest in the instant\ncase, but he *843 had a general prayer for relief which is sufficient for the award of pre-judgment\ninterest under Art. 5069-1.03. The Republic National Bank of Dallas v. Northwest National Bank\nof Fort Worth, supra, at 116.\n\n [16] In the instant case, the suit was for recovery of damages based on the breach of a written\ncontract. The amount of appellant's damages cannot be ascertained on the basis of the liquidated\ndamage clause because it has been construed as a penalty provision. However, the contract in\nquestion ended August 31, 1977, and the actual damages were found by the jury and were\nascertained in the damage issue as a definite sum as of September 1, 1977, less the conversion\noffset admitted by appellant. We hold that appellant was entitled to recover 6% pre-judgment\ninterest under Article 5069-1.03 on the sum of $10,189.72 from October 1, 1977, pursuant to the\nthirty day provision of that statute to date of judgment on June 9, 1980.\n\n [17] Appellee asserts ten cross-points of error. In his first two cross-points, he argues the evidence\nconclusively showed as a matter of law that Butler Drilling Corporation did not assume or ratify\nthe contract, or that the jury finding to special issue number one was so against the great weight and\npreponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust. The contract in question indicates it was\nsigned and notarized on August 24, 1974, during which period of time negotiations were being had\nfor purchase of the assets of Butler Drilling Company. It was signed by Duncan Butler, President\nof Butler Drilling Company, who also was president of the successor corporation, Butler Drilling\nCorporation. There was evidence the contract in question was listed as an asset of Butler Drilling\nCompany when the assets were sold and the successor corporation Butler Drilling Corporation\nacquired them. The attorney for the purchaser discussed the contract with Mr. McClain, Vice-\nPresident of Butler Drilling Company, who also later became vice-president of the successor\ncorporation, and the attorney testified Mr. McClain told him the contract was oral. Butler Drilling\nCorporation abided by and operated under the contract for a year from October 1, 1974, to October\n24, 1975, when it terminated the contract. In addition, a letter from Mr. McClain was in evidence\nwhich referred to the written contract while he was acting as vice-president of Butler Drilling\nCorporation. Appellant contends that Duncan Butler actually signed the contract sometime after\nAugust 24, 1974, and that Butler Drilling Corporation thought the contract was an oral month to\nmonth arrangement rather than a written contract. While the evidence is conflicting, we find there\nwas sufficient evidence to support the jury answer to special issue number one and said answer\nwas not against the great weight and preponderance of evidence. Appellee's first and second cross-\npoints are overruled.\n\n [18] In its cross-points three and four, appellee contends the evidence conclusively showed as a\nmatter of law that Duncan Butler did not have authority to sign the contract on behalf of Butler\nDrilling Company, or that the jury answer to special issue number five to such effect was so\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust.

Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d 834 (1982)\n\n\n\ncontends there is no authority shown because the charter, by-laws and corporate minutes do not\nreflect the granting of any authority and the contract in question is not a matter in the ordinary\nand usual course of company business indicating inherent apparent authority. The special issue\nincluded both actual and apparent authority. The only Board of Directors for the company was Joe\nK. Butler, chairman of the Board; Duncan Butler, President; and Lee McClain, Vice-President.\nJoe K. Butler testified that he instructed Duncan Butler and Lee McClain to negotiate a contract\nwith appellant. The by-laws of the corporation provide the President has the power to employ and\ndischarge all employees and agents for the company. Both Butler Drilling Company and Butler\nDrilling Corporation operated and acted under the contract for more than a year, which provided\nfor maintenance of the company's radio equipment, an activity *844 in the every day operation\nof the company. This was the same activity which had been carried on by appellant for Butler\nDrilling Company on a month to month oral basis for nine to ten years prior to the date of the\nwritten contract. Appellee's cross-points three and four are overruled.\n\n [19] [20] [21] In its fifth and sixth cross-points, appellee says the evidence conclusively shows\nas a matter of law appellant is judicially estopped from claiming unlawful termination by reason of\ntestimony given in another lawsuit where he stated he quit, or that the answer by the jury to special\nissue number three that plaintiff was terminated is so against the great weight and preponderance\nof the evidence as to be manifestly unjust because of this prior testimony of plaintiff. While\nappellant appeared to make conflicting statements as to whether he quit or was terminated, he later\nexplained the discrepancy. He said he was confused and thought he was being asked about the\nother corporation, not Butler Drilling Corp., and equivocated on the earlier testimony that he quit.\nOne of the requirements for application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel is that the statement\nmust be deliberate, clear and unequivocal. American Savings and Loan Association of Houston\nv. Musick, 531 S.W.2d 581, 589 (Tex.1975). The elements related to judicial estoppel are not\nshown conclusively or by the overwhelming weight and preponderance of the evidence, and we\nbelieve the question went to the weight of the evidence. Further, no one contended appellant quit\nat the instant trial. Both parties to the instant trial agreed appellant was terminated by appellee. The\ncontested issue was whether the termination was with or without good cause. Appellee's cross-\npoints five and six are overruled.\n\n [22] Appellee's cross-points seven and eight assert that as a matter of law appellant converted\nproperty of the value of $6420.28, rather than the $4300.00 awarded by the court, and that by\nthe great weight and preponderance of evidence, the jury should have answered $6420.28 to the\nconversion issue in special issue number thirteen. One of the items of conversion was a General\nElectric base station radio for which appellee had paid appellant but had never received. Appellant\nadmitted by pleading and evidence this conversion of payment and this was the item which the trial\ncourt offset against the damages awarded appellant when the court disregarded the jury answer\nto special issue number thirteen. The other items contended by appellant to establish conversion\nas a matter of law or by the overwhelming weight and preponderance of the evidence relate to\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The burden of proof on the issue was on appellee and from a review of the evidence we\ndo not believe conversion or the specific amounts claimed were established as a matter of law or\nby an overwhelming weight and preponderance of the evidence. We overrule appellee's seventh\nand eighth cross-points.\n\n [23] Appellee's final two cross-points of error assert the evidence conclusively established as a\nmatter of law appellant was terminated for good cause and that special issue number four should\nnot have been submitted to the jury, or else the jury's answer thereto should have been disregarded.\nFurther, appellee contends that the jury finding to special issue number four was so against the\ngreat weight and preponderance of evidence as to be manifestly unjust. The evidence was in\nconflict on the question but in our view it does not show as a matter of law or by the great weight\nand preponderance of the evidence that appellant was terminated for good cause due to alleged\ninsubordination and misconduct. Appellee's cross-points nine and ten are overruled.\n\nThe judgment of the trial court is reformed to provide for six percent prejudgment interest on the\nsum of $10,189.72 from October 1, 1977, to date of judgment on June 9, 1980 with post judgment\ninterest as provided by law. The judgment of the trial court is otherwise affirmed.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                         © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Background\n\nMyrad and Fountainhead are residential real estate developers. Fountainhead is a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Myrad. Texcon is a construction contractor. On June 23, 1994, Myrad entered into\na written contract with Texcon for the construction of roadway, drainage, sewer, and waterline\nimprovements to the Cat Hollow subdivision in College Station, Texas (the Cat Hollow contract).\nOn October 6, 1994, Fountainhead entered into a written contract with Texcon for the construction\nof similar improvements to the Cypress Meadow subdivision and the Hidden Hollow subdivision,\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\nand for improvements to Rock Prairie Road, also located in College Station (the Springbrook\ncontract).\n\nTexcon claimed it entered into several oral agreements with Myrad and Fountainhead for\nadditional work outside the written contracts and was never paid for this work. Consequently,\nTexcon filed three mechanic's and materialman's liens on Cat Hollow, Cypress Meadow, and\nHidden Hollow.\n\nSubsequently, Myrad and Fountainhead sued Texcon, each asserting a claim for breach of contract\nand seeking actual and liquidated damages for the untimely completion of the Cat Hollow and\nSpringbrook contracts. Furthermore, Myrad and Fountainhead each sought a declaratory judgment\nthat Texcon's liens were invalid and unenforceable because they were not filed timely. Myrad\nalso brought a claim for fraud, alleging Texcon falsely represented on April 19, 1995, that it was\naccepting payment in full and had no outstanding claims for work performed before such date.\n\nTexcon filed a counterclaim, alleging breach of contract for Myrad and Fountainhead's failure\nto pay for additional work performed pursuant to oral agreements. Texcon also brought a claim\nfor fraud, alleging several misrepresentations, including: (1) Myrad and Fountainhead wanted an\ninformal working relationship in which they could request that work be performed by Texcon on\nan as needed basis and Texcon would be compensated for such work; and (2) Texcon would not\nbe subject to any penalties as a result of any delays or interference caused by Myrad, Fountainhead\nor their other contractors. Texcon also sought (1) a declaratory judgment that its liens were valid,\nand (2) the foreclosure of its liens and the sale of the properties.\n\nAt trial, the jury found: (1) Texcon did not breach the Springbrook contract; (2) Texcon breached\nthe Cat Hollow contract and awarded Myrad $10,000.00 for the cost of obtaining a bond to secure\nTexcon's lien claims, but did not award any damages for lost profits or lost business opportunity;\n(3) Myrad or Fountainhead breached an oral or written agreement with Texcon and awarded\nTexcon $75,000.00; (4) Texcon did not commit fraud against Myrad or Fountainhead; (5) Myrad\nand Fountainhead did not commit fraud against Texcon; and (6) Myrad or Fountainhead acted with\nintent to harm, or with conscious indifference to the rights of Texcon, but did not award exemplary\ndamages. The jury awarded attorney's fees to Texcon in the amount of $83,000.00 for trial and\nadditional amounts for appeal to the court of appeals and the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n *2 The jury was further asked to determine the start and completion dates for Texcon's work under\nthe contracts. The jury found: (1) the beginning date for Cat Hollow was July 5, 1994, and the\ncompletion date was January 30, 1995; (2) the beginning date on Hidden Hollow was December\n21, 1994, and the completion date was April 14, 1995; and (3) the beginning date for Cypress\nMeadow was October 6, 1994, and the completion date was February 12, 1995.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court further entered judgment\non the jury's award of $75,000.00 for breach of contract and attorney's fees to Texcon.\n\n\n\n                                                 II. Cat Hollow\n\n\n                                           A. Liquidated Damages\n\nIn its first point of error, Texcon claims the trial court erred in awarding liquidated damages to\nMyrad under the Cat Hollow contract. Texcon first argues the liquidated damages clause is an\nunenforceable penalty. A liquidated damages clause is the measure of recovery in the event of a\nbreach of the contract. See Newsom v. State, 922 S.W.2d 274, 281 (Tex.App.-Austin 1996, writ\ndenied); Baker v. International Record Syndicate, Inc., 812 S.W.2d 53, 55 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1991,\nno writ). Whether a liquidated damages provision is enforceable is determined by a two-prong\ntest: (1) the harm caused by the breach must be incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) the\namount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation. See Phillips\nv. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 788 (Tex.1991). Whether a contractual provision is an enforceable\nliquidated damages provision or an unenforceable penalty is a question of law. See id.Factual\nissues, however, must sometimes be resolved before a legal conclusion can be determined. See id.\n\nThe party asserting that the liquidated damages clause is an unenforceable penalty bears the burden\nof proving it is a penalty. See R. Conrad Moore & Assocs., Inc. v. Lerma, 946 S.W.2d 90, 95\n(Tex.App.-El Paso 1997, writ denied); Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. La Villa Indep. Sch. Dist.,\n779 S.W.2d 102, 106 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1989, no writ). To satisfy its burden, Texcon was\nrequired to prove the amount of Myrad's actual damages, if any, for establishing an absence of\nan approximation between the actual loss and the stipulated sum. See Johnson Eng'rs, Inc. v. Tri-\nWater Supply Corp., 582 S.W.2d 555, 557 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1979, no writ); Robinson v.\nGranite Equip. Leasing Corp., 553 S.W.2d 633, 637 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1977, writ\nref'd n.r.e.). If the liquidated damages are shown to be disproportionate to the actual damages, the\nliquidated damages provision must be declared a penalty and recovery is limited to actual damages\nproven.Commercial Union Ins. Co., 779 S.W.2d at 107.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 3\n\fCDS Enterprises, Inc. v. Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\n\n\n*3 The liquidated damages clause in the Cat Hollow contract states in pertinent part:\n\n   If the CONTRACTOR should neglect, fail, or refuse to complete work within the time herein\n   specified, or any proper extension thereof granted by the OWNER'S REPRESENTATIVE,\n   then the CONTRACTOR does hereby agree as part of consideration for the awarding of this\n   contract, that OWNER may withhold permanently from CONTRACTOR'S total compensation\n   the sum of Five Hundred and no/100 Dollars ($500.00) for each and every calendar day that the\n   CONTRACTOR shall be in default after the time stipulated for completing the work, not as a\n   penalty, but as liquidated damages for the breach of [the] contract.\n\n***\n\n   The amount is fixed and agreed upon by and between the CONTRACTOR and the OWNER\n   because of the impractability and extreme difficulty in fixing and ascertaining actual damages.\n   The OWNER would, in such an even [sic], sustain, and the amount is agreed to be damages the\n   OWNER would sustain and shall be retained by [the] OWNER from current periodic estimates\n   for payment or from final payment.\n\nTexcon claims Myrad's damages were not uncertain or difficult to estimate because Myrad\npresented evidence regarding the amount of its damages. Dan Bensimon, one of Myrad's owners,\ntestified that Myrad lost $52,000.00 from the inability to use and sell the Cat Hollow lots during\nTexcon's delayed performance. Another court of appeals has rejected a similar argument. See\nMurphy v. Cintas Corp., 923 S.W.2d 663, 666 (Tex.App.-Tyler 1996, writ denied). In Murphy,\nthe court observed that even if actual damages could have been calculated at the time of trial,\nsuch testimony was long after the execution of the contract. See id.The uncertainty or difficulty\nin determining damages must have existed at the time the contract was executed. See id.;Oetting\nv. Flake Uniform & Linen Serv. Inc., 553 S.W.2d 793, 796 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth 1977, no\nwrit). Similarly, Bensimon's testimony regarding Myrad's damages was two years after the parties\nentered into the Cat Hollow contract.\n\nMoreover, Texcon did not meet its burden in proving the liquidated damages clause was\nunenforceable because it failed to prove the amount of Myrad's actual damages. See Murphy, 923\nS.W.2d at 666; Johnson Eng'rs, Inc., 582 S.W.2d at 557; Robinson, 553 S.W.2d at 637. To satisfy\nits burden, Texcon would have had to offer evidence of Myrad's actual damages. Texcon failed\nto introduce such evidence. 1\n\n *4 Texcon also asserts there is no reasonable relation between the jury's award of $0 for lost\nprofits and lost business opportunities and the trial court's award of $29,500.00 for liquidated\ndamages. The jury found Texcon breached the Cat Hollow contract, but awarded no damages for\nlost profits and lost business opportunities. The contract provided Texcon had 150 days in which\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               4\n\fCDS Enterprises, Inc. v. Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\nto complete its work. The jury found Texcon began construction under the Cat Hollow contract\non July 5, 1994, and completed performance on January 30, 1995, which was 59 days late. Myrad\nmoved for judgment N.O.V. on its' liquidated damages. The trial court granted Myrad's motion\nand entered a finding of fact that Texcon completed its work 59 days late. The trial court further\nentered conclusions of law that Myrad's damages were uncertain and difficult or impossible to\ncalculate, and that $500.00 per day liquidated damages was reasonable. Therefore, we find the\ntrial court's award of liquidated damages in the amount of $29,500.00 is proper.\n\nNext, Texcon argues Myrad waived the liquidated damages clause by releasing the retainage. See\nAnderson Dev. Corp. v. Coastal States Crude Gathering Co., 543 S.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex.Civ.App.-\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Waiver is an affirmative defense which may be\nasserted against a party who intentionally relinquishes a known right or engages in intentional\nconduct which is inconsistent with the claimed right. See Tenneco, Inc. v. Enterprise Prods. Co.,\n925 S.W.2d 640, 643 (Tex.1996). In determining whether waiver has occurred, the court must\nexamine the acts, words, or conduct of the parties and it must be unequivocally manifested that it is\nthe intent to no longer assert the right. See Robinson v. Robinson, 961 S.W.2d 292, 299 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1997, no writ.).\n\nDebbie Keating, the engineer on Cat Hollow, reviewed Texcon's invoices for approval for\npayment. When she received the “Invoice for Balance Due” from Texcon in April 1995, she called\nO.E. “Buster” Smith, president of Texcon, to determine if it was, in fact, the last invoice because\nit showed retainage was due. After speaking to Smith, she recommended paying the retainage,\nbut not all the items on the invoice. If this had not been the last invoice, Keating would not have\nrecommended paying the retainage.\n\nAfter paying the retainage, Myrad received several invoices on April 28, 1995, in the amount\nof $59,000 for work performed months earlier, which Texcon asserts was extra-contractual done\npursuant to oral agreements. Keating did not believe these invoices were valid because they were\nfor delay or idle time, which were expressly not payable under the contract, and for backfilling,\nwhich was incidental to work and not a separate item under the contract.\n\nBensimon testified that Texcon was to submit its bills on or before the 25th of each month for work\ndone in the preceding month. This procedure included bills for any additional work not covered\nby the written contract. Myrad could have no way of knowing Texcon would submit additional\ninvoices for work done months before. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said Myrad waived\nits right to seek liquidated damages. Texcon's first point of error is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                           B. Delay in Performance\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  5\n\fCDS Enterprises, Inc. v. Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\n *5 In its second point of error, Texcon claims the trial court erred in awarding liquidated damages\nto Myrad under the Cat Hollow contract because any delay in performance was excused by the\nuntimely performance of another contractor hired by Myrad. In its third point of error, Texcon\nclaims the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's finding that Texcon\nbreached the Cat Hollow contract.\n\nA contractor is excused from performance when the owner fails to provide the required means\nto complete the contract. See Sage Street Assocs. v. Northdale Constr. Co., 809 S.W.2d 775, 777\n(Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1991), aff'd in part and remanded in part on other grounds,863\nS.W.2d 438 (1993). Excuse for nonperformance is an affirmative defense upon which Texcon had\nthe burden of proof. SeeTEX.R.CIV.P. 94.\n\nBecause Texcon bore the burden of proof at trial that its untimely performance was excused, it must\ndemonstrate on appeal that the evidence conclusively established all vital facts in support of the\nissue. See Sterner v. Marathon Oil Co., 767 S.W.2d 686, 690 (Tex.1989). For a no evidence point\nof error, we examine the record for all evidence that supports the jury's finding, while ignoring\nall evidence to the contrary. See id.If there is no evidence to support the jury's finding, we then\nexamine the entire record to determine if the contrary proposition is established as a matter of\nlaw. See id.\n\nIn reviewing a challenge that the jury's adverse finding is against the great weight and\npreponderance of the evidence, we must examine the entire record, considering both the evidence\nin favor of, and contrary to, the challenged finding. See Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176\n(Tex.1986) (per curiam). We must uphold the jury's finding unless it so against the great and weight\nand preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust or wrong. See Pool v. Ford Motor\nCo., 715 S.W.2d 629, 635 (Tex.1986). The jury as trier of fact is the sole judge of the credibility\nof the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony. See Times Herald Printing Co. v.\nA.H. Belo Corp., 820 S.W.2d 206, 213 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, no writ). Because\nthe appellate court is not the fact finder, it may not substitute its own judgment for that of the trier\nof fact, even if a different answer could be reached on the evidence. See Maritime Overseas Corp.\nv. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 407 (Tex.), cert. denied,525 U.S. 1017, 119 S.Ct. 541, 142 L.Ed.2d 450\n(1998). The amount of evidence necessary to affirm a judgment is far less than that necessary to\nreverse a judgment. See Peter v. Ogden Ground Servs., Inc., 915 S.W.2d 648, 650 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1996, no writ).\n\n *6 Myrad argues Texcon, by its failure to submit a separate jury question on excuse rather than an\ninstruction, waived any finding that its breach of the Cat Hollow contract was excused. We note,\nhowever, that in broad form submission, an affirmative defense may be submitted as an instruction\nwhere the burden of proof is properly placed. Cropper v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 754 S.W.2d 646,\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     6\n\fCDS Enterprises, Inc. v.

The question submitted to the jury asked:\n\n            Did Texcon breach the Cat Hollow contract and proximately cause damage to\n            Myrad or Fountainhead?\n\nSeveral instructions on excuse were submitted to the jury:\n\n   Failure to comply by a party is excused if compliance is waived by the other party.\n\n   A waiver is an intentional surrender of a known right or intentional conduct inconsistent with\n   claiming the right.\n\n   Failure to comply by a party is excused if all the following circumstances occurred:\n\n   1. the acting party:\n\n      a. By words or conduct made a false representation or concealed material facts,\n\n      b. With knowledge of the facts or with knowledge or information that would lead a reasonable\n         person to discover the facts, and\n\n      c. With the intention that the other party would rely on the false representation or concealment\n         in acting or deciding not to act; and\n\n   2. the excused party:\n\n      a. Did not know and had no means of knowing the real facts and\n\n      b. Relied to its detriment on the false representation or concealment of material facts.\n\n   Failure to comply, if any, by a party is excused by the other party's previous failure, if any, to\n   comply with a material obligation of the same agreement.\n\nHere, because the burden of proof was properly placed, Texcon did not waive this defense. In any\nevent, we find that Texcon's challenge to the sufficiency of evidence that its delayed performance\nwas not excused must fail.\n\nAs previously noted, the contract provided Texcon had 150 days to complete its work. The jury\nfound Texcon began construction under the Cat Hollow contract on July 5, 1994, and completed\nperformance on January 30, 1995, when Texcon signed the completion certificate, or 209 days. In\naccordance with the jury's finding, Texcon's timely completion of the Cat Hollow contract should\nhave occurred by December 1, 1994.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\n\n\nThe road work for Cat Hollow involved the laying of (1) the subgrade, (2) the curbs and gutters,\n(3) the base, and (4) the asphalt. Myrad contracted with Texcon for the subgrade, base, and asphalt,\nbut not the curbs and gutters. South Construction was to provide that work. In subgrading, the\nentire road bed is graded, and then lime is laid down to stabilize the surface. The curb and gutter\nwork cannot begin until the lime stabilization is complete.\n\n *7 On October 3, 1994, Texcon submitted a construction schedule to Myrad, under which\nTexcon would complete the subgrade by October 17, 1994. Texcon allowed eleven to sixteen\ndays for South Construction to put in approximately 5000 linear feet of curbs and gutters. Texcon\nclaims South Construction was to begin work on the curbs and gutters on October 17, 1994,\ncompleting such work by November 1, 1994. Myrad does not dispute that it should have taken\nSouth Construction eleven to sixteen days to complete its work. Myrad asserts Texcon completed\nthe subgrade late. Therefore, South Construction started the curb and gutter work late. Myrad also\nmaintains that South Construction timely completed its work once it was able to start work.\n\nAt trial and at deposition, Smith gave conflicting testimony regarding when Texcon had completed\nthe subgrade. At trial, Smith testified that Texcon completed the subgrade on October 25, 1994. In\nhis deposition testimony, which was read at trial, Smith stated that Texcon completed the subgrade\non November 5, 1994. Therefore, South Construction, by either date, could not have started its\nwork on October 17, 1994.\n\nBensimon testified, based on concrete delivery tickets, the curb and gutter work started on\nNovember 7 or 8, 1994. This is consistent with Smith's testimony that Texcon completed the\nsubgrade on November 5. Myrad further presented evidence that Texcon was laying the base in\nDecember. David Dobbs, the city inspector, testified that his log entry for December 9, 1994,\nshows that Texcon was laying the base on two of the four streets in Cat Hollow, which indicated to\nhim that South Construction had finished the curbs and gutters on those two streets. Furthermore,\nDobbs testified that his log entry for December 13 1994, states that Texcon was “laying base\nthroughout entire job.”\n\nThe final stage of street construction, which is laying the base, involves hauling in the rock which\nmakes the base, spreading it, blading it with a grader, watering it, compacting it, and finally having\nit tested for compaction. Dobbs testified that his log entries for the compaction testing showed that\ntesting was occurring on all four streets on December 21, 1994, but he did not have any test dates\nafter that. Therefore, according to Myrad, the base was completed as of December 21, 1994.\n\nTexcon disputes Myrad's claim that it had completed the base as of December 21, 1994. With\nrespect to compaction testing, Dobbs further stated he felt sure there was other testing after\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\nDecember 21, 1994, even though he was not able to find such entries after that date. The\ncompaction testing results were not entered into evidence.\n\nTexcon further points to testimony that the quality of South Constructions's work was poor and\nhad to be redone through out the subdivision. Dobbs testified that he believed this curb and gutter\nproject was the first such project for Larry Schultz of South Construction. Smith testified that\nSouth Construction tried to use a machine to pour the concrete, but its crew did not know how\nto use the machine and spent considerable time practicing with it. Moreover, Dobbs testified he\nfound the curb and gutter work to be of poor quality and not acceptable to the standards for the\nCity of College Station. Dobbs stated that those unacceptable sections of curb and gutter had to\nbe taken out and redone, taking additional time.\n\n *8 Dobbs' log entry for December 13, 1994, shows, in addition to “Texcon-laying base through\nout entire job,” that South Construction needed to remove and replace two sections of the curb.\nDobbs' log entry for January 3, 1995, states “Mike South-told him to tear out curb in culdesac [sic]\non Lynx and put it back to grade!”Dobbs's log book contains several entries showing that Texcon\nwas doing backfilling work on the curbs in late December 1994, and backfilling the sidewalks\nthrough most of January 1995.\n\nThe jury, as the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their\ntestimony, was entitled to discount the testimony of any witness. See Skrepnek v. Shearson Lehman\nBros., Inc., 889 S.W.2d 578, 579 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, no writ). Because we are\nnot the fact finder, we may not substitute our own judgment for that of the jury, even if we were\nto draw a different conclusion on the evidence. See Maritime Overseas Corp., 971 S.W.2d at 407.\nTherefore, we cannot say the jury's finding is against the great weight and preponderance of the\nevidence. Texcon's second and third points of error are overruled.\n\n\n\n                                                     C. Bond\n\nIn its fourth point of error, Texcon challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence in\nsupport of the jury's finding that Myrad's cost of obtaining a “bond” was $10,000.00. 2 The question\nsubmitted to the jury asked for “[t]he reasonable and necessary cost of obtaining a bond.”Texcon\nfirst asserts the only evidence Myrad presented concerned a letter of credit, not a bond. In the\nalternative, Texcon argues there is no evidence or insufficient evidence for an award greater than\n$5,000.00.\n\n *9 Bensimon testified that to convey clear title to the Cat Hollow lots, Myrad had to obtain\na “nonstatutory bond.” To this end, Myrad executed an “Indemnity Agreement with Letter of\nCredit to Protect Against Defects in Title,” under which Myrad indemnified University Title\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\nCompany against all adverse claims, including Texcon's liens. Commercial National Bank issued a\n$119,000.00 letter of credit to the title company to secure Myrad's obligation under the Indemnity\nAgreement.\n\nTexcon argues Myrad's letter of credit is not a suretyship bond because it is not a negotiable\ninstrument. SeeTEX.BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 3.104(a); Heritage Housing Corp. v. Ferguson,\n651 S.W.2d 272, 273 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1983, no writ). 3 No definition of “bond” was provided in\nthe jury charge which would limit the type of instrument for which Myrad could recover damages.\nHere, the letter of credit served the same purpose as a “bond,” that is, to indemnify Myrad against\nTexcon's liens. Accordingly, the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support a finding\nthat Myrad had obtained a “bond.”\n\nIn the alternative, Texcon contends there is no evidence or factually insufficient evidence that\nMyrad expended more than $5,000.00 to obtain the letter of credit. Bensimon testified that the total\nexpense of the letter of credit was $5,000.00, “not including having to put up cash collateral for\nthe letter of credit.”A review of the record reflects no evidence of the amount of damages Myrad\nsustained from the of loss of the use of the cash it had put up as collateral for the letter of credit.\nTherefore, we find the evidence legally insufficient to support the jury's award of $10,000.00 for\nthe cost of obtaining a bond. Texcon's fourth point of error is sustained and the award for obtaining\na bond is reduced to $5,000.00.\n\n\n\n                                          III. Springbrook Contract\n\n *10 In its fifth point of error, Texcon asserts the trial court erred in awarding liquidated damages\nto Fountainhead under the Springbrook contract. At trial, Fountainhead claimed Texcon breached\nthe Springbrook contract by failing to complete timely all improvements to Hidden Hollow. 4 The\njury found that Texcon did not breach the Springbrook contract and, consequently, awarded no\ndamages. In a summary judgment hearing prior to trial, the court found that Texcon commenced\nwork on the Springbrook contract, which included Cypress Meadow and Hidden Hollow, on\nOctober 6, 1994, and completed work on April 14, 1995. In a separate question regarding Texcon's\nbeginning and completion dates, the jury found Texcon began construction on Hidden Hollow on\nDecember 21, 1994, and completed construction on April 14, 1995, 114 days later.\n\nFountainhead filed a motion for partial judgment notwithstanding the verdict, asking that the\ntrial court enter judgment against Texcon for breach of the Springbrook contract and to enforce\nthe liquidated damages provision for 130 days in accordance with the court's previous summary\njudgment finding. Granting the motion, the trial court awarded $65,000.00 in liquidated damages\nto Fountainhead. Subsequently, the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law to\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  10\n\fCDS Enterprises, Inc. v. Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\nthe effect that Fountainhead's damages were uncertain and difficult or impossible to calculate, and\n$500.00 per day liquidated damages are reasonable.\n\nAt trial, Texcon argued its breach, if any, was excused by Bensimon “pulling” its crews of the\nHidden Hollow project to work on the Cypress Meadow subdivision. 5 Therefore, we shall address\nthe propriety of the trial court's granting Fountainhead's motion for partial JNOV. 6\n\n *11 A motion for JNOV is based upon the same grounds that have or could have been urged in\na motion for directed verdict. SeeTEX.R.CIV.P. 301. A JNOV may be upheld only if there is no\nevidence to support the jury's findings. See Mancorp., Inc. v. Culpepper, 802 S.W.2d 226, 227\n(Tex.1990). In considering a “no evidence” point, we review the record in the light most favorable\nto the jury's findings, considering only the evidence and inferences supporting the finding and\nrejecting evidence and inferences to the contrary. See Navarette v. Temple Indep. Sch. Dist., 706\nS.W.2d 308, 309 (Tex.1986). If more than a scintilla of evidence supports the jury's finding, the\nverdict must be upheld, and the JNOV reversed. See Culpepper, 802 S.W.2d at 228; Navarette,\n706 S.W.2d at 310.\n\nSmith, and Texcon's project manager Gary Arnold, testified that once Texcon started work on\nHidden Hollow, Fountainhead sent Texcon's crews to work on Cypress Meadow. Dobbs testified\nthat he witnessed Texcon workmen being pulled from the Hidden Hollow worksite. Considering\nonly the evidence supporting the jury's finding of no breach, and rejecting all evidence to the\ncontrary, we find there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury's finding that Texcon\ndid not breach the Springbrook contract on the basis that any delay by Texcon was caused by\nFountainhead. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting Fountainhead's motion for JNOV and\nawarding Fountainhead liquidated damages on its own finding of breach. Accordingly, Texcon's\nfifth point of error is sustained.\n\n\n\n                                            IV. Special Exceptions\n\nIn its seventh point of error, Texcon contends the trial court erred in refusing to give Texcon an\nopportunity to amend its pleadings after sustaining a special exception on a claim for constructive\nfraud. When the trial court sustains special exceptions, the pleader must be given, as a matter of\nright, an opportunity to replead. Friesenhahn v. Ryan, 960 S.W.2d 656, 658 (Tex.1998). Only\nafter the special exceptions are sustained and the party has been given an opportunity to amend its\npleadings may a claim be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. See Centennial Ins. Co. v.\nCommerical Union Ins. Cos., 803 S.W.2d 479, 483 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, no writ).\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\nOn the first day of trial, after hearing arguments from the parties, the court granted Myrad and\nFountainhead's special exception to Texcon's claim for constructive fraud. 7 Afterwards, Texcon\nstated to the court, “Your Honor, we should be entitled to replead as to that particular issue\nthen.”Texcon failed to obtain a ruling from the trial court.\n\n *12 Myrad and Fountainhead argue Texcon waived this complaint for review for failure to request\nan opportunity to amend and failure to obtain a ruling. Once special exceptions have been granted,\nthe party against whom the special exceptions have been sustained has the burden to seek leave\nto amend its pleadings. See Fuentes v. McFadden, 825 S.W.2d 772, 779 (Tex.App.-El Paso 1992,\nno writ). Before a party can complain on appeal that it was denied the opportunity to amend after\nspecial exceptions have been sustained, it must show that an opportunity was requested and denied.\nSee Inglish v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 928 S.W.2d 702, 705 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.]\n1996, writ denied) (citing TEX.R.APP.P. 52(a) (current rule TEX.R.APP.P. 33.1)). Where a party\nis denied the right to amend and such fact is not reflected in the record, a motion for new trial\nwill preserve such error. See id.\n\nAlthough Texcon requested an opportunity to amend its counterclaim, it did not obtain a ruling\non its request. Texcon claims it has preserved error in its motion for new trial. Our review of the\nmotion for new trial finds that Texcon has not preserved error on its complaint that it was denied an\nopportunity to amend its counterclaim with respect to constructive fraud. Texcon's seventh point\nof error is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                            V. Validity of the Liens\n\nIn its eighth point of error, Texcon complains the trial court erred in declaring its liens invalid and\nunenforceable. The jury awarded Texcon $75,000.00 on its breach of contract claim. The jury,\nhowever, did not determine the amount of any indebtedness for each tract. In its conclusions of\nlaw filed post-judgment, the trial court stated the liens “are not capable of enforcement and must\nbe invalidated because any indebtedness for work performed on any specific, separate tract of land\nfor which a lien was claimed was not established and Texcon thus waived its right to enforcement\nby foreclosure of a lien, if any.”Texcon argues the trial court could have apportioned the damages\namong the three liens and credited each lien with a pro-rata reduction. 8\n\nTo be entitled to foreclose on a mechanic's and materialman's lien, the claimant must prove the\nproperty on which he wants to foreclose is the improvement itself or the parcel of land connected\nwith the improvements.

In our view appellant failed to discharge its burden of proving the\n            value of the concrete attributable to Lot 7 as distinguished from Lot 5.\n\n574 S.W.2d 621, 624 (Tex.Civ.App.-Tyler 1978, no writ).Morris v. Chauce A. Beane & Co.\ninvolved multiple plaintiffs and four contracts on three separate oil field leases. 635 S.W.2d\n658, 660 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1982, no writ). Although the jury in Morris found damages for\neach indebtedness as to each plaintiff, the trial court entered judgment in a single amount to the\nplaintiffs. See id.The court of appeals found the trial court erred in failing to segregate the damages.\nThe trial court's judgment should establish the indebtedness accrued for which the defendant was\nliable as to each plaintiff, as applied to each parcel of land foreclosed and ordered sold, with the\ndecree framed so that each parcel is directed to be sold separately so that from time of judgment,\nthe amount necessary to redeem the lien on each parcel is known. See id. at 559.The defective\njudgment prejudiced the defendant's right to redemption. See id.\n\nSimilarly, Texcon's failure to obtain a jury finding for each separate tract under each of the liens\nprejudices Myrad and Fountainhead's right to redemption in the event of foreclosure. The trial court\nmay not enter an order foreclosing a mechanic's and materialman's lien without a determination\nof the amount of indebtedness for improvements applicable to each separate tract.\n\nTexcon further argues the trial court could have apportioned the $75,000.00 jury award among the\nthree liens on a pro-rata basis. See Gill Sav. Ass'n v. International Supply Co., 759 S.W.2d 697, 700\n(Tex.App.-Dallas 1988, writ denied).Gill Sav. Ass'n is distinguishable from this case. The issue in\nthat case was whether a lien affidavit, which stated an amount in excess of the amount reconciled\nby the time of trial, was in substantial compliance with the statute. See id.Texcon's eighth point\nof error is overruled.\n\nIn its ninth point of error, Texcon asserts the trial court erred in determining that Texcon's Cypress\nMeadow and Hidden Hollow liens were untimely filed. Because of our disposition of Texcon's\neighth point of error, it is not necessary to for us to address this point.\n\n\n\n                                          VI. Exclusion of Evidence\n\nIn its tenth point of error, Texcon claims the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of a\nwitness. The admission or exclusion of evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\nSee City of Brownsville v. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex.1995). To obtain reversal of a\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   13\n\fCDS Enterprises, Inc. v. Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\njudgment based upon error in the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must show (1)\nthe trial court did in fact commit error, and (2) the error was reasonably calculated to cause and\nprobably did cause the rendition of an improper judgment. SeeTEX.R.APP.P. 44.1; Gee v. Liberty\nMut. Fire Ins. Co., 765 S.W.2d 394, 396 (Tex.1989). The appellant must show the judgment turns\non the particular excluded or admitted evidence. See Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d at 753-54.\n\n *14 Texcon proffered its expert witness, A.P. Boyd, who was designated for matters relating\nto construction methods, to testify about prior dealings he had had with Myrad on a different\nsubdivision construction project. Myrad and Fountainhead objected on the basis that Texcon was\ntrying to show conformity with a prior act. SeeTEX.R.EVID. 404(b). 9 The trial court sustained the\nobjection. Texcon contends such evidence is admissible to establish intent for fraud and exemplary\ndamages.\n\nIn the bill of exception, Boyd testified the city inspector had told him it was too wet to shoot the\nbase. Bensimon, however, ordered Boyd to prime the streets and told him he would “accept the\nresponsibility” for it. After priming the streets, it rained, washing the prime into a creek. The city\nordered Boyd's company to clean up the oil spoil. After signing a full lien release, Boyd invoiced\nMyrad $800 for the cleanup.\n\nWe find that Boyd's testimony was intended to show that Myrad was acting in conformity with\nprior conduct. Therefore, it was not relevant to the issue of intent in Texcon's claims for fraud\nand exemplary damages. The trial court did not err in excluding Boyd's testimony. Texcon's tenth\npoint of error is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                              VII. Attorney's Fees\n\nIn its sixth point of error, Texcon claims the trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees to Myrad\nand Fountainhead. First, Texcon argues Myrad and Fountainhead are not entitled to attorney's fees\nbecause they should not have prevailed on their claims. As already determined, Myrad prevailed\non its claim for breach of the Cat Hollow contract and Myrad and Fountainhead both prevailed\non their claims for declaratory judgment that Texcon's liens are invalid and unenforceable.\nSeeTEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 38.001(8) (Vernon 1997) (providing attorney's fees\nto party prevailing on breach of contract claim); TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 37.009\n(Vernon 1997) (providing for attorney's fees in declaratory judgment proceeding).\n\nSecond, Texcon asserts the trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees based on the testimony\nof Myrad and Fountainhead's expert, Cully Lipsey. Lipsey, Myrad and Fountainhead's original\nattorney on this case, testified that a reasonable hourly rate is $150.00 to $200.00. He testified\nto overall reasonable fees as follows: $100,000.00 for trial and trial preparation; $5,000.00 to\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\n$10,000.00 for appeal to the court of appeals; $3,000.00 for writ of error to the Texas Supreme\nCourt; and $2,000.00 to $3,000.00 if writ is granted.\n\n *15 Texcon objected to Lipsey's testimony on the basis that his opinions and mental impressions\nhad not been disclosed in response to Texcon's interrogatories. In their response to Texcon's\ninterrogatories, Myrad and Fountainhead stated Lipsey would “testify regarding reasonableness\nof liquidated damages and attorneys [sic] fees.”Texcon argues Lipsey's testimony should have\nbeen excluded under Rule 215(5) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides for the\nautomatic exclusion of evidence for failure to respond to or supplement a response to a request\nfor discovery in the absence of good cause. SeeTEX.R.CIV.P. 215(5); see also Stern v. State ex\nrel. Ansel, 869 S.W.2d 614, 627-28 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, writ denied). Texcon\ncontends that if Lipsey's testimony had been excluded, there would have been no basis on which\nthe trial court could take judicial notice of Myrad and Fountainhead's attorney's fees.\n\nWhen the issue of attorney's fees is left to the trial court rather than the jury, the court may\ndetermine a reasonable fee for legal services based upon its knowledge of usual and customary\nrates and its review of the file, even if no other evidence is offered. See Long Trusts v. Atlantic\nRichfield Co., 893 S.W.2d 686, 687 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 1995, no writ); Budd v. Gay, 846 S.W.2d\n521, 524 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1993, no writ); Flint & Assocs. v. Intercontinental Pipe &\nSteel, Inc., 739 S.W.2d 622, 626 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1987, writ denied). The court may take judicial\nnotice of the contents of its file with or without the request of a party. SeeTEX.R.EVID. 201(c).\nEven if the trial court does not state that it took judicial notice of reasonable attorney's fees, the\nappellate court may presume the trial court took judicial notice of reasonable attorney's fees. See\nRoss v. 3D Tower Ltd., 824 S.W.2d 270, 273 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, writ denied).\n\nA trial court's award of attorney's fees will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. See\nid.The test for whether the trial court has abused its discretion is whether it acted without reference\nto any guiding rules and principles, that is, whether the court's action was arbitrary or unreasonable.\nSee Long Trusts, 893 S.W.2d at 688.\n\nHere, the parties agreed to try the issue of Myrad and Fountainhead's attorney's fees to the trial\ncourt. The court's judgment does not reflect that it relied on Lipsey's testimony. The trial court was\nentitled to take judicial notice of its file and determine reasonable fees based on its knowledge of\nusual and customary rates without any testimony or other evidence. Moreover, even though there\nis no indication of whether the trial court took judicial notice of its file, we shall presume it did.\nWe cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in its awarding attorney's fees to Myrad and\nFountainhead.\n\n *16 Texcon also argues Myrad and Fountainhead had a duty to segregate its attorney's fees by\nclaims. Generally, the party seeking attorney's fees must segregate the fees incurred for claims\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In such a case as this,\nwhere the claims are dependent upon the same set of facts or circumstances and, therefore,\nare so intertwined to be inseparable, Myrad and Fountainhead were not required to segregate\ntheir attorney's fees for each claim and may recover their fees for all their claims. See id. at\n11. 10 Texcon's sixth point of error is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                             Prejudgment Interest\n\nIn its eleventh point of error, Texcon contends the trial court erred in calculating prejudgment\ninterest. The court awarded prejudgment interest at a rate of six percent. The court, however,\nentered amounts for prejudgment interest equal to the damage award plus interest. This appears\nto be a clerical error. When the trial court errs in calculating the judgment, this court has the\nauthority to reform the judgment. See GXG, Inc. v. Texacal Oil & Gas, 977 S.W.2d 403, 423\n(Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1998, pet. denied); H.J. Thywissen Corp. v. Cron, 781 S.W.2d 682, 687\n(Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, writ denied). We therefore reform the judgment to reflect\nthe actual amount of prejudgment interest on the $29,500.00 liquidated damages award and the\nmodified $5,000.00 award for the cost of obtaining the letter of credit, rather than the actual awards\ncombined with their respective prejudgment interest. Texcon's eleventh point of error is sustained.\n\n\n\n                                               VIII. Cross-Points\n\nIn four cross-points, Myrad and Fountainhead challenge the submission of jury questions regarding\ntheir alleged breach of any oral or written contract with Texcon, the jury's finding that they\nbreached any oral or written contract with Texcon, and the award of damages to Texcon for such\nbreach. Texcon asserts that Myrad and Fountainhead have waived each point by requesting that\nthe trial court enter judgment on the jury's findings on their breach.\n\nIf a party files a motion for the trial court to enter judgment on the verdict, and the trial court\nenters that judgment, the party cannot challenge the judgment on appeal Casu v. Marathon Ref.\nCo., 896 S.W.2d 388, 389 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1995, writ denied). This is a variation\nof the invited error doctrine which prohibits a party from complaining on appeal about an error\nwhich it invited. See Morse v. Delgado, 975 S.W.2d 378, 381 (Tex.App.-Waco 1998, no pet.).\n\n *17 Myrad and Fountainhead filed a motion for partial judgment on the verdict, in which they\nrequested that the trial court accept the jury's findings that Texcon had breached the Cat Hollow\ncontract, that Myrad was entitled to damages, and that they did not commit fraud against Texcon.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\nIn its judgment, the trial court stated that “having considered the above-referenced motions, and\nthe arguments of counsel, [it] is of the opinion that the motions should be granted.”In addition\nto ordering Myrad and Fountainhead's relief, the trial court ordered Texcon's recovery: “IT IS\nFURTHER ORDERED that the Defendant, Texcon General Contractors, A Division of CDS\nEnterprises d/b/a Texcon have and recover from Plaintiffs the sum of Seventy Five Thousand\nDollars ($75,000.00).” The final page of the judgment contains signature lines for all trial counsel\nfor “APPROVED AS TO FORM.” However, none of the trial counsel signed as approving the\nform of the judgment.\n\nMyrad and Fountainhead specifically asked the trial court to enter judgment on specific jury\nfindings favorable to them and on other recovery which they had specifically requested. At no\ntime did they request the trial court to enter judgment on the jury's verdict that they had breached\nany oral or written contract with Texcon. We do not find that Myrad and Fountainhead waived\ntheir right to challenge that portion of the judgment entered in favor of Texcon.\n\nIn their first cross-point, Myrad and Fountainhead claim the trial court erred in submitting\nQuestions Nos. 5 and 6 regarding breach of an oral contract because (1) they were multifarious\nand (2) there was no evidence of any oral contract. 11 Myrad and Fountainhead first argue Question\nNo. 5 was multifarious. A review of the record establishes that Myrad and Fountainhead failed to\nobject to the submission of this question on that basis. Therefore, Myrad and Fountainhead have\nfailed to preserve error on this complaint. SeeTEX.R.APP.P. 33.1.\n\nNext, Myrad and Fountainhead do not dispute that they made verbal requests of Texcon for extra\nwork not included in the written contracts and that Texcon was paid for any work done pursuant\nto verbal requests. 12 Instead, they assert there is no evidence that they orally requested Texcon to\ndo the work covered by the invoices upon which Texcon sues or that they agreed to pay Texcon\nfor such work. Texcon maintains that the evidence establishes several implied contracts.\n\n *18 To be legally binding, a contract must be sufficiently definite in its terms so that a court can\nunderstand what the promisor undertook. See T.O. Stanley Boot Co. v. Bank of El Paso, 847 S.W.2d\n218, 221 (Tex.1992). The difference between an express contract and one implied in fact is the\ncharacter and manner of proof required to establish them. See Haws & Garrett Gen. Contractors,\nInc. v. Gorbett Bros. Welding Co., 480 S.W.2d 607, 609 (Tex.1972). In each instance, the element\nof mutual assent must be shown, which, in the case of an implied contract, is inferred from the\ncircumstances. See id.Any conduct of one party, from which the other party may reasonably draw\nthe inference of a promise, is effective in law as such. See id. at 609-10.\n\nBecause Myrad and Fountainhead have brought a no evidence point of error, we may only consider\nthe evidence and inferences supporting the existence of any oral contracts, and must disregard\nall evidence to the contrary. See ACS, Inv., Inc., 943 S.W.2d at 430. Therefore, under this point\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                17\n\fCDS Enterprises, Inc. v. Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\nof error, we shall not consider any evidence Myrad and Fountainhead have cited which does not\nsupport the submission of an issue on the existence of any oral agreements.\n\nMyrad and Fountainhead assert the only evidence of the existence of any oral agreement was\nfrom a conversation between Smith and Bensimon prior to signing the Cat Hollow contract. Smith\ntestified that he told Bensimon that he was concerned about another contractor doing the curb\nand gutter work and how that would affect or delay Texcon's performance of the Cat Hollow\ncontract. Smith further testified that Bensimon promised there would be no delay and if there were\na problem, Myrad would take care of it.\n\nTexcon claims there is evidence sufficient to support the existence of several oral agreements,\nwhich are implied in fact. With regard to the Cat Hollow contract, Smith and Arnold testified that\nTexcon was ultimately responsible for constructing reinforced concrete sidewalks and recessed\nstorm sewer inlets, even though these structures were deleted from the Cat Hollow contract\nand other contractors had started working on them. Texcon performed this work pursuant to\noral agreements with Myrad. Smith further testified that the late invoices for labor and services\nfurnished at Cat Hollow included idle time and the inexperience of the curb and gutter contractor\nresulting in Texcon's having to be on the job to assure drainage and protection for the subgrade,\nwas work performed pursuant to verbal agreements, and that Texas was not paid.\n\nWith regard to Cypress Meadow, Smith testified that work for relocating and lowering a gas\nline, which was installed on Fountainhead's property, and for relocating water and sewer service\nmarkers, which were destroyed by the street contractor, was performed in accordance with oral\nagreements and the invoices for this work were not paid. Smith also testified that Texcon has\nnot been paid for work done in repairing utility ditch lines, which was done pursuant to a verbal\nagreement.\n\n *19 Moreover, in support of its claim that the oral contracts were implied in fact, Texcon relies\non Buxani v. Nussbaum, 940 S.W.2d 350 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1997, no writ). In that case, a\ncontractor was hired to do a remodeling job. See id. at 351.During the course of remodeling, the\nowners orally requested extra work from the contractor, which was performed. See id.When, the\ncontractor presented the owners with an itemized statement of the additional work performed, the\nowners refused payment. See id.On appeal, the owners challenged the trial court's finding of mutual\nassent. The court of appeals found mutual assent based on the parties' conduct: (1) the owners\nassented to the terms of the oral agreement through their conduct, and (2) the owners allowed the\nitems to be installed and services to be performed without objecting to anything until the time for\npayment arrived. See id. at 352.Mutual assent was also found in the contractor's testimony that he\ntold the owners there would be an additional charge for the extra items and that the owners agreed\nto pay for the extra work. See id. at 352-53.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               18\n\fCDS Enterprises, Inc. v. Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\nSimilarly, mutual assent can be based upon Myrad and Fountainhead's allowing work to be\nperformed on their property without objecting. Even if price is lacking, a reasonable price can be\nimplied when all other elements of a contract have been met. See id. at 353 (citing Bendalin v.\nDelgado, 406 S.W.2d 897, 900 (Tex.1966)). We find there is more than a scintilla of evidence to\nsupport the existence of oral contracts for additional work. Myrad and Fountainhead's first cross-\npoint is overruled.\n\nIn their second cross-point, Myrad and Fountainhead challenge the legal and factual sufficiency of\nthe evidence to support the jury's verdict that they had breached any oral or written contract with\nTexcon. We shall consider the evidence discussed in the previous cross-point. Additionally, in our\nfactual sufficiency review, we shall consider evidence contrary to the jury's finding that there was\na breach. See Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176.\n\nMyrad and Fountainhead argue that any unpaid invoices contain charges for delay time or remedial\nwork not compensable under the terms of the written contracts. Also, pursuant to the written\ncontracts, Texcon was to bill on a monthly basis for the work performed during the prior month,\nregardless of whether such work was done under the written contract or for extra work. Smith\ntestified that he followed this procedure.\n\nOn the Cat Hollow contract, Smith testified that he did not submit the invoices to Myrad for work\ndone under any oral agreements until after he had accepted the retainage because he “had mixed\nemotions about what to do with them. And then there were circumstances that arose afterwards that\nhelped [him] make up [his] mind.”Myrad contends delay and idle time are specifically prohibited\nunder the Cat Hollow contract. Bensimon testified that he did not agree to pay Texcon for any\nidle time.\n\n *20 Texcon submitted invoices for work it claims was performed under the written Cat Hollow\ncontract related to trench safety, laying pipe, and excavation, which was done in July and August\n1994. Myrad refused payment of these invoices when they were originally submitted. Texcon\nagain submitted these invoice in April 1995, with its request for retainage. Debbie Keating, the\nproject engineer, rejected these invoices for payment. Bensimon stated that these invoices were\nnot paid because Myrad disagreed with the requested amounts.\n\nWith respect to the invoice for repairing ditch lines in Cypress Meadow, Texcon prepared\nthis invoice on April 28, 1995, even though this work apparently started in January. Texcon\ncompleted Cypress Meadow on April 14, 1995. Fountainhead asserts that there is no evidence\nthat Fountainhead agreed to pay for this work. Mike McClure, the project engineer, testified that\nthis was remedial work for which Texcon was responsible without further compensation under the\nwritten contract. Smith testified that the written contract does not provide for extra compensation\nfor repairing ditch lines.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\n\n\nWith respect to the invoices for relocating and lowering a gas line, which was installed on\nFountainhead's property, and for relocating water and sewer service markers, which were\ndestroyed by the street contractor, these were not line items under the written contract.\nFountainhead contends there is no evidence that Texcon was asked to do this work or why Texcon\nwould have to redo this work when it was the fault of another contractor or the gas company.\n\nThe only invoice under the written contract regarding Cypress Meadow is for unpaid retainage in\nthe amount of $30,510.00, which was included in the original amount of the lien. With respect\nto Hidden Hollow, Texcon introduced five invoices totaling $30,092.50 for work under the\nwritten contract. There is no dispute that Texcon was not paid the balance for these invoices,\nbut Fountainhead asserts Texcon failed to complete timely Hidden Hollow and was entitled to\nliquidated damages. The jury, however, did not find that Texcon had breached the Springbrook\ncontract and we have found the trial court erred in granting Fountainhead's motion for JNOV.\n\nWe cannot say the jury's finding that Myrad or Fountainhead breached any oral or written contract\nis so against the great and weight and preponderance of evidence as to be manifestly unjust or\nwrong. See Pool, 715 S.W.2d at 635. The jury, as the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses\nand the weight to be given to their testimony, was entitled to discount the testimony of any witness.\nSee Skrepnek, 889 S.W.2d at 579. Myrad and Fountainhead's second cross-point is overruled.\n\nIn their third cross-point, Myrad and Fountainhead argue that even if there is evidence of their\nbreach of any contract with Texcon, there is no evidence or factually insufficient evidence of\ndamages in the amount of $75,000.00; therefore, the trial court erred in entering judgment against\nthem for $75,000.00.\n\n *21 The total amount of allegedly unpaid invoices which Texcon sought in the three liens was\n$121,120.36. Under the written Cat Hollow contract, Texcon claims $8,341.00 in unpaid work\nand $59,001.75 under its oral agreements with Myrad. Texcon submitted an invoice for $30,510\nfor unpaid retainage on Cypress Meadow and $25,380.50 for unpaid work done pursuant to oral\nagreements. The original amount of the lien on Cypress Meadow was $55,890.50, but Texcon\nfiled a partial release for $32,205.39, leaving a net lien of $23,685.11. On Hidden Hollow, Texcon\nsubmitted five invoices for unpaid work performed under the written contract totaling $30,092.50,\nthe amount of the Hidden Hollow lien. Smith testified to loss of interest income of $27,500.00 and\nloss for interest on loans of $72,689.00.\n\nConsidering the amount of damages sought by Texcon and the amount which the jury ultimately\nawarded, it is clear that the jury did not find that Texcon was entitled to recovery on every claim.\nIt is clear, however, that the $75,000.00 award is supported by the evidence. While it is not clear\nhow the jury arrived at this amount, it is within the jury's discretion to award damages within a\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Myrad Real Estate, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.2d (1999)\n1999 WL 548226\n\nrange of evidence presented at trial. See Howell Crude Oil Co. v. Donna Ref. Partners, Ltd., 928\nS.W.2d 100, 108 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ denied). Myrad and Fountainhead's\nthird cross-point is overruled.\n\nIn its fourth cross-point, Myrad and Fountainhead contend the trial court erred in entering judgment\nagainst it because jury's findings were not sufficient to support the judgment. Because of the\ndisjunctive form of the questions, it cannot be ascertained from the jury's finding whether it was\nMyrad or Fountainhead that was in breach of contract. Moreover, the judgment does not specify\nwhether Texcon is to recover from Myrad, Fountainhead, or both.\n\nThey argue the trial court did not have the proper specific findings upon which to enter a\nsufficiently definite and certain judgment. A judgment must be sufficiently definite and certain to\ndefine and protect the rights of all litigants, or it should provide a definite means of ascertaining\nsuch rights, to the end that ministerial officers can carry the judgment into execution without\nascertainment of facts not therein stated. See Stewart v. USA Custom Paint & Body Shop, Inc.,\n870 S.W.2d 18, 20 (Tex.1994).\n\nIn a case from another court of appeals, a similar argument was addressed: i.e., that the liability of\nmultiple defendants could not be determined from the jury's answer's to disjunctive questions and,\nthus, the trial court had no basis upon which to render a proper judgment. See J & C Drilling Co.\nv. Salaiz, 866 S.W.2d 632, 640 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1993, no writ). The J & C Drilling court\nnoted that the appellants had properly preserved error in their supplemental motion for judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict and motion for new trial. See id.A review of the record reveals that\nMyrad and Fountainhead failed to raise this complaint in the trial court in either its motion for new\ntrial, motion to modify, correct or reform the judgment, or motion to disregard the jury verdict.\nInstead, they asserted it for the first time on appeal. Having waived this complaint for appellate\nreview, Myrad and Fountainhead's fourth cross-point is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                                 IX. Conclusion\n\n *22 We affirm the judgment with respect to liquidated damages for Texcon's breach of the\nCat Hollow contract, Myrad and Fountainhead's attorney's fees, and damages for Myrad and\nFountainhead's breach of oral contract. The judgment awarding Myrad $10,000.00 for the cost of\nobtaining a bond is modified to $5,000.00 and the prejudgment interest on the $29,500.00 award\nfor liquidated damages is modified to reflect the actual amount of prejudgment interest rather the\naward for liquidated damages combined with prejudgment interest. As modified, the judgment\nis affirmed. Finally, that portion of the judgment awarding Fountainhead liquidated damages for\nbreach of the Springbrook contract is reversed and it is rendered that Fountainhead take nothing\non its claim that Texcon breached the Springbrook contract.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Sears sitting by assignment.\n\n1    Texcon also asserts Myrad's damages were capable of estimation because they should be calculated as the rental value during the\n       delay in the same way damages are calculated for the delayed construction of a building. See Muller v. Light, 538 S.W.2d 487, 488\n       (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Ryan v. Thurmond, 481 S.W.2d 199, 206 (Tex.Civ.App.-Corpus Christi 1972, writ\n       ref'd n.r.e.). This comparison between a finished building and improved land is inapposite. In any event, Texcon failed to introduce\n       any evidence of the rental value of the improved lots. See Murphy, 923 S.W.2d at 966; Johnson Eng'rs, Inc., 582 S.W.2d at 557;\n       Robinson, 553 S.W.2d at 637.\n2      Because Texcon challenges a jury finding upon which Myrad had the burden of proof, we will use the “no evidence” standard of\n       review. When reviewing a challenge to the legal sufficiency of evidence, i.e., a “no evidence” point of error, the reviewing court\n       may consider only the evidence and inferences that support the challenged finding and should disregard all evidence and inferences\n       to the contrary. See ACS Inv., Inc. v. McLaughlin, 943 S.W.2d 426, 430 (Tex.1997). If there is more than a scintilla of evidence\n       to support the finding, the claim is sufficient as a matter of law, and any challenges merely go to the weight of the evidence. See\n       Browning-Ferris, Inc. v. Reyna, 865 S.W.2d 925, 928 (Tex.1993). The court may sustain a no evidence point of error if: (1) the record\n       discloses a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving weight\n       to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3)the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a scintilla; or (4) the\n       evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of the vital fact. See Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328, 334\n       (Tex.1998), cert. denied,526 U.S. 1040, 119 S.Ct. 1336, 143 L.Ed.2d 500 (1999). There is some evidence when the proof supplies\n       a reasonable basis upon which reasonable minds could reach different conclusions about the existence of a vital fact. See Orozco v.\n       Sander, 824 S.W.2d 555, 556 (Tex.1992).\n3      A letter of credit is the third contract in a set of three independent contracts. The first contract is the agreement between the parties\n       to the underlying obligation, or the contract between the obligor and obligee. The second contract is ordinarily between the bank or\n       the issuer and the obligor, which precipitates the issuance of the letter of credit. The third contract, or letter of credit, is a contract\n       between the issuer and the beneficiary providing that the issuer will make payment to the beneficiary upon the presentation of a draft\n       and certain documents, a documentary draft, or upon the presentation of a draft, a clean letter. See AIG Risk Management, Inc. v.\n       Motel 6 Operating, L.P., 960 S.W.2d 301, 307 n. 1 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1997, no pet.)(citing Republic Nat'l Bank of Dallas v.\n       Northwest Nat'l Bank of Fort Worth, 578 S.W.2d 109, 112 (Tex.1978)).\n4      Fountain claims Texcon was to complete Hidden Hollow in 60 days and Cypress Meadow in 210 days. Texcon maintains that had\n       210 days to complete all work under the Springbrook contract, including Hidden Hollow, and therefore, it completed its work in a\n       timely manner. For the disposition of this point of error, we need not determine this provision of the Springbrook contract.\n5      We find this argument dispositive of the other arguments contained in this point of error. Texcon also argues (1) the liquidated damages\n       clause is an unenforceable penalty, and (2) the contract provided Texcon with 210 days to substantially complete the Springbrook\n       contract, which included both Cypress Meadow and Hidden Hollow and, therefore, there was no breach because Hidden Hollow\n       was completed timely.\n6      Fountainhead asserts that Texcon does not challenge the trial court's granting of the JNOV, but only challenges the enforcement of\n       the liquidated damages clause on the basis of the jury's finding of no breach. To the contrary, we find Texcon's challenge to the trial\n       court's award of liquidated damages to Fountainhead a challenge to the JNOV.\n7      Myrad and Fountainhead filed a special exception to Texcon's first amended counterclaim on May 2, 1996. Attempting to address\n       the special exception, Texcon filed a second amended counterclaim on May 6, 1996. At a hearing on May 10, 1996, Myrad and\n       Fountainhead asked the trial court to consider their special exception to the first amended counterclaim. The court, however, ordered\n       them to refile their special exception. They did not refile their special exception, but instead, on the first day of trial, asked the\n       trial court to rule on the previously tendered special exception. Texcon reminded the court of what had transpired at the previous\n       hearing and argued that they should have amended their special exception to address the second amended counterclaim. Myrad and\n       Fountainhead acknowledged that Texcon had repleaded in response to their special exception, but argued Texcon still had not alleged\n       facts to support a claim for constructive fraud.\n8      Texcon filed three liens: (1) on Cat Hollow for $67,342.75, (2) on Cypress Meadow for $55,890.50, and (3) on Hidden Hollow for\n       $30,092.50. Texcon filed a partial release on the Cypress Meadow lien in the amount of $32,205.39, with $23,685.11 remaining\n       on that claim.\n9      Rule 404(b) states:\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

However, the buyers did not\nclose on the property as provided in the purchase contract, and, at the seller's instruction, the title\ncompany transferred the buyers' earnest money to the seller. The buyers, Chiu Moon Chan and\nElla Y. Chan, later sued the seller, Montebello Development Company, L.P. (“Montebello”) and\nthe title company, Stewart Title Company (“Stewart Title”), for the return of their earnest money.\nThe trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Montebello and Stewart Title, and declared\nthat the purchase contract was terminated and Montebello was entitled to keep the earnest money\nas liquidated damages under the purchase contract.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\nIn eight issues on appeal, the Chans contend that the trial court erred by: (1) granting summary\njudgment on the appellees' declaratory judgment action; (2) determining that the amount of the\nearnest money, $92,000, was an accurate estimate of actual damages; (3) granting summary\njudgment when the purchase contract was void for lack of mutuality of obligation; (4) granting\nsummary judgment in favor of Montebello on all of the Chans' claims for affirmative relief; (5)\ngranting summary judgment in favor of Stewart Title on all of the Chans' claims for affirmative\nrelief; (6) awarding attorneys fees of $20,000 because the award is inequitable and unjust; (7)\nfailing to exclude the affidavit of George Gibson as evidence in support of the attorney's fee award;\nand (8) failing to exclude the affidavit of Jeanette Harris as summary judgment evidence.\n\nFor the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n\nFactual and Procedural Background\nMontebello is the owner and developer of the Montebello Condominium, a thirty-story residential\ncondominium building located in Uptown Park in Houston, Texas. In February 2002, Montebello\nand the Chans entered into a Purchase Contract (the “Contract”) for the sale and purchase of a\ncondominium unit on the twenty-third floor of the building for a total purchase price of $920,000.\nAs provided in the Contract, the Chans deposited earnest money, defined in the purchase contract\nas the “Initial Payment,” of $92,000 with Stewart Title. The Chans had negotiated the Initial\nPayment down from twenty percent to ten percent of the total purchase price. Ultimately, however,\nthe Chans failed to close on the unit, and Stewart Title delivered the Initial Payment to Montebello.\n\nIn November 2005, the Chans sued Montebello and Stewart Title to recover the Initial Payment,\nasserting claims of unjust enrichment, breach of contract, and tortious interference with contract\nagainst Montebello. The Chans alleged conversion and negligence against both Montebello\nand Stewart Title, and as to Stewart Title only, the Chans alleged promissory estoppel, fraud,\nnegligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty. The Chans sought actual and punitive\ndamages, and attorney's fees. 1 Montebello and Stewart Title answered, and Montebello also filed a\ncounterclaim asserting breach of contract and requesting a declaratory judgment that it was entitled\nto the Initial Payment as liquidated damages under the Contract. Montebello requested attorney's\nfees as provided in the Contract and under the Declaratory Judgments Act. SeeTEX. CIV.\nPRAC. & REM.CODE § 37.009. The Chans answered and alleged as affirmative defenses fraud,\nmisrepresentation, waiver, mistake, failure to mitigate, non-occurrence of conditions precedent,\nand denial of pre-judgment interest.\n\n *2 Montebello and Stewart Title moved for summary judgment against all of the Chans' claims\nand sought a declaration that, as a matter of law, the Contract was terminated and Montebello was\nentitled to the Initial Payment as liquidated damages. Among other things, Montebello asserted\nthat it substantially completed the construction of the unit, but the Chans did not comply with the\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\nContract's obligations, including scheduling a final walk-through inspection and timely closing on\nthe property. Appellees also asserted that Stewart Title properly delivered the Initial Payment to\nMontebello in accordance with the Contract. The Chans responded and objected to Montebello and\nStewart Title's summary judgment proof, 2 but they did not deny that they failed to comply with\ntheir obligations under the Contract to purchase the unit. Instead, they asserted that, after entering\ninto the Contract, they encountered financial difficulties and requested a refund of the Initial\nPayment, and they also offered to reimburse Montebello for an “agreed amount of reasonable\nactual damages.”However, Montebello refused to refund any amount of the Initial Payment. The\nChans further asserted that the contractual provision permitting Montebello to retain the Initial\nPayment in the event of the purchaser's default was unreasonable and an unenforceable penalty.\n\nAfter the parties submitted additional briefing, the trial court entered a judgment in favor of\nMontebello and Stewart Title. In the judgment, dated September 27, 2006, the trial court declared\nthat the Contract was terminated and Montebello was entitled to keep the Initial Payment as\nliquidated damages under the Contract, and awarded attorney's fees of $20,000 to Montebello and\nadditional attorney's fees of $7,500 if an appeal is filed in the court of appeals and $7,500 if a\npetition for review is filed in the Texas Supreme Court. The trial court included in the judgment\nlanguage demonstrating that it expressly intended to dispose of all parties and claims and that the\njudgment was final. 3 This appeal followed.\n\n\nAnalysis of the Chans' Issues\n\nI. Is the Liquidated Damages Provision an Unenforceable Penalty?\nIn their first two issues, the Chans contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\non Montebello's claim for declaratory judgment and awarding it the $92,000 Initial Payment as\nliquidated damages under the Contract, because the amount is excessive and constitutes an illegal\npenalty. 4 We disagree.\n\n\nB. The Contract Provision at Issue\nThe Contract provided for liquidated damages in the event of default by the purchaser in the\nfollowing provision:\n\n           In the event of any default by Purchaser under this Contract, Seller may (i)\n           terminate this Contract, in which event the Initial Payment shall be delivered\n           to Seller as liquidated damages and not as a penalty because of the uncertainty\n           and difficulty of ascertaining and measuring Seller's actual damages, and neither\n           Purchaser nor Seller shall have any further rights or obligations under this\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\n           Contract, (ii) enforce specific performance of this Contract, or (iii) seek damages\n           or any other available remedies.\n\n\nB. The Applicable Law\n *3 The test for determining whether a provision is valid and enforceable as liquidated damages\nis (1) if the damages for the prospective breach of the contract are difficult to measure; and (2) the\nstipulated damages are a reasonable estimate of actual damages. Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d\n785, 788 (Tex.1991) (citing Rio Grand Valley Sugar Growers, Inc. v. Campesi, 592 S.W.2d 240,\n342 n. 2 (Tex.1979)); Baker v. Int'l Record Syndicate, Inc., 812 S.W.2d 53, 55 (Tex.App.-Dallas\n1991, no writ); Naylor v. Siegler, 613 S.W.2d 546, 547 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth 1981, no writ).\nGenerally, the question of whether a contractual provision is an enforceable liquidated damages\nprovision or an unenforceable penalty is a question of law for the court and is to be determined\nas of the time when the contract was executed. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788; Zucht v. Stewart\nTitle Guar. Co., 207 S.W.2d 414, 418 (Tex.Civ.App.-San Antonio 1947, writ dism'd); Bourland\nv. Huffhines, 244 S.W. 847, 849 (Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo 1922, writ dism'd w.o.j.).\n\nIn determining whether a provision is for a penalty or for liquidated damages, the intention of\nthe parties should govern. Zucht, 207 S.W.2d at 418. Merely designating a provision as one for\n“liquidated damages” will not prevent the court from holding that the provision is in fact a penalty;\nhowever, when it clearly appears from the terms of the contract that it was the intention of the\nparties that the sum stated should be treated as providing for liquidated damages, this intention\nwill be enforced. Elliott v. Henck, 223 S.W.2d 292, 295 (Tex.Civ.App.-Galveston 1949, writ ref'd\nn.r.e.).\n\nThe burden is on the party asserting the defense of penalty to demonstrate that the contractual\nprovision is an unenforceable penalty rather than an enforceable liquidated damages provision.\nSee Fluid Concepts, Inc. v. DA Dallas Apartments Ltd. P'ship, 159 S.W.3d 226, 231 (Tex.App.-\nDallas 2005, no pet.); Johnson Eng'rs, Inc. v. Tri-County Water Supply Corp., 582 S.W.2d 555,\n557 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1979, no writ); Tri-Cities Constr., Inc. v. Am. Nat'l Ins. Co., 523\nS.W.2d 426, 428 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1975, no writ). In order to meet this burden,\nthe party asserting the defense is required to prove the amount of the other parties' actual damages,\nif any, to show that the liquidated damages are not an approximation of the stipulated sum. Johnson\nEng'rs, Inc., 582 S.W.2d at 557. If the liquidated damages are shown to be disproportionate to the\nactual damages, then the liquidated damages must be declared a penalty and recovery limited to\nthe actual damages proven.Id.\n\nTexas courts have consistently held that damages for breach of a contract to buy or sell real\nestate are “ ‘uncertain and not easily estimated with accuracy.’ “ Thanksgiving Tower Partners v.\nAnros Thanksgiving Partners, 64 F.3d 227, 232 (5th Cir.1995) (citing Enclave, Inc. v. Resolution\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    4\n\fChan v. Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\nTrust Corp., 986 F.2d 131, 134(5th Cir.1993) (quoting Zucht, 207 S.W.2d at 419)). For example,\nin Zucht, the court explained: “It has been held, time and again, that a provision for liquidated\ndamages in a contract for the sale and purchase of real estate is proper as being a transaction in\nwhich the damages for the breach thereof are uncertain and not easily estimated with accuracy.”\nZucht, 207 S.W.2d at 419 (collecting cases). Texas courts have recognized that often “[i]t is\nimpossible to forecast the damages which might flow to the seller of real property in the event of\nbreach of the contract by the purchasers,” because “[r]eal property has a fluctuating value” and\n“[t]here is no way to ascertain at any given time what the value of a particular tract of real property\nmight be in the future.” Naylor, 613 S.W.2d at 547.\n\n\nC. The Liquidated Damages Provision is Not an Unenforceable Penalty\n*4 In support of their contention that the Contract's liquidated damages provision is an\nunenforceable penalty, the Chans stress the following language from Phillips:\n\n           The right of competent parties to make their own bargains is not unlimited.\n           The universal rule for measuring damages for the breach of a contract is just\n           compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained. By the operation of that\n           rule a party generally should be awarded neither less nor more than his actual\n           damages. A party has no right to have a court enforce a stipulation which violates\n           the principle underlying that rule.\n\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. Consequently, the Chans argue the trial court erred because it “never\ninquired into the evidence of actual injuries to attempt to do justice between the parties,” and\nas a result, Montebello received a windfall. See id.(noting that, although the question whether a\ncontractual provision is enforceable is a question of law, sometimes factual issues must be resolved\nbefore the legal question can be decided).\n\nThe Chans, relying on a 2006 property tax record from the Harris County Appraisal District,\nassert that information concerning Montebello's actual damages was readily available. However,\nevidence that a property sold at a later date for the same price, or even at a profit, is no evidence that\na provision is an unreasonable stipulation as to contemplated damages. Zucht, 207 S.W.2d at 419;\nThanksgiving Tower Partners, 64 F.3d at 232-33;see also Baker, 812 S.W.2d at 55 (“Evidence\nrelated to the difficulty of estimation and the reasonable forecast must be viewed as of the\ntime the contract was executed.”). The Chans also speculate that Montebello must possess other\ninformation that would show actual damages, such as “financial information with respect to the\nconstruction and occupancy of the property” and “marketing allowances for each Unit.” However,\nthey submitted no evidence of any such information in response to the motion for summary\njudgment. 5 The Chans further speculate as to the type of actual damages that would be incurred\nby Montebello, such as “remarketing expenses” and “depreciation expense,” and conclude that the\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                       5\n\fChan v. Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\namount of $92,000 is “such a bad estimate of damages, that Montebello reaped a windfall profit off\nof the misfortune” of the Chans, but cite no evidence or authorities in support of this conclusion.\n\nMoreover, the primary authorities the Chans do cite are distinguishable. First, in Phillips, the\nTexas Supreme Court considered a contractual provision in which one party agreed to pay the\nother party as liquidated damages ten times the actual damages. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 787,\n789. The Court determined that such a provision involved no fact issues, as it could not meet either\npart of the test for an enforceable liquidated damages provision. Id. at 789.The Chans also cite\nFlores v. Millennium Interests, Ltd., 185 S.W.3d 427, 431 (Tex.2005), to support their contention\nthat the trial court erred because the amount of liquidated damages, $92,000, was excessive. In\nthat case, the Court was asked, on certified questions from the Fifth Circuit, to construe certain\nstatutes applying to contracts for deed. Id. at 428.The Court noted that, while an amount stipulated\nin advance as an acceptable measure of damages may be either an enforceable liquidated damages\nprovision or an unenforceable penalty under the common law, the same “does not always hold true\nfor statutes.”Id. at 431.Consequently, the Court determined that a statutory “liquidated damages”\nprovision for noncompliance, when invoked, was penal in nature. Id. at 433.Here, in contrast, the\ncontractual provision at issue is in no way comparable to the provision at issue in Phillips or the\nstatutes considered in Flores, and so neither case supports the Chans' claim.\n\n *5 The Chans also complain that Montebello has offered no legal authority or extrinsic evidence\nto support its assertion that damages would be impossible to ascertain or that the liquidated\ndamages amount was a reasonable estimate of actual damages. However, as the party asserting\nthe affirmative defense of penalty, the burden was on the Chans, not Montebello, to demonstrate\nthat the Contract's liquidated damages provision was an unenforceable penalty. See, e.g., Fluid\nConcepts, Inc., 159 S.W.3d at 231; Johnson Eng'rs, Inc., 582 S.W.2d at 557; Tri-Cities Constr.,\nInc., 523 S.W.2d at 428.\n\nThe Chans, as the party with the burden to prove their affirmative defense of penalty, cite no\nauthorities to contradict the longstanding recognition that damages for the breach of a contract\nto buy or sell real estate are uncertain and not easily estimated. See, e.g., Thanksgiving Tower\nPartners, 64 F.3d at 232; Zucht, 207 S.W.2d at 419; Naylor, 613 S.W.2d at 547. Further, the Chans\nagreed to the liquidated damages provision, which clearly provides that, in the event of the Chans'\ndefault, the Initial Payment shall be delivered to Montebello “as liquidated damages and not as a\npenalty” because of “the uncertainty and difficulty of ascertaining and measuring” Montebello's\nactual damages. The provision plainly reflects the intent of the parties to provide for liquidated\ndamages in the amount of the Initial Payment. See Elliott, 223 S.W.2d at 295 (holding that terms of\nagreement to purchase beach-front property plainly expressed the parties' intention that the earnest\nmoney constituted liquidated damages and stating that “[h]ere the amount of the damages that\nwould be sustained by the seller by a breach was uncertain in the same sense that the amount of\nthe damages for a breach of a contract for the sale of real estate is generally uncertain.”).\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  6\n\fChan v. Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\n\n\nMoreover, the Chans negotiated the amount of the Initial Payment down from twenty percent of\nthe purchase price of the unit to ten percent, further limiting their liability under the provision.\nThe negotiated amount of earnest money, $92,000, or ten percent of the total purchase price\nof $920,000, is a reasonable amount of liquidated damages in a real estate transaction such as\nthis one. See Ashton v. Bennett, 503 S.W.2d 392, 394-95 (Tex.Civ.App.-Waco 1974, writ ref'd\nn.r.e.) (upholding liquidated damages provision entitling seller to approximately sixteen percent\nof purchase price); Thanksgiving Tower Partners, 64 F.3d at 232 (holding that $5 million was a\nreasonable liquidated damage amount despite an internal memorandum stating that the anticipated\ndamages were only $1.4 million); see also Aguiar v. Segal, 167 S.W.3d 443, 455-56 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied) (holding that buyers' failure to close within agreed time\nconstituted a breach of earnest money contracts and sellers were entitled to terminate contracts\nand recover earnest money as liquidated damages). Consequently, given the information before\nit, there was no need for the trial court to resolve additional factual issues before rendering its\ndecision.\n\n*6 Therefore, we agree with the trial court's conclusion that, as a matter of law, the Contract's\nprovision was an enforceable liquidated damages provision rather than an unenforceable penalty.\nWe overrule the Chans' first two issues.\n\n\nII. Is the Contract Void for Lack of Mutuality of Obligation?\nIn their third issue, the Chans contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\nbecause the Contract is void for lack of mutuality of obligation. According to the Chans, under\nthe Contract, Montebello was under no obligation to actually provide a unit to them because the\nContract specifically states that Montebello would not “warranty the completion of the Unit on\nany given date.”Again, we disagree.\n\n\nA. The Contract Provision at Issue\nThe provision the Chans rely on is the following:\n\n  7. Construction Schedule/Effects of Building Activities. the Unit is or will be constructed\n  in accordance with plans and specifications for the Unit to be prepared by Ziegler Cooper\n  Architects (the “Plans and Specifications”) based on the preliminary plans and specifications\n  prepared by Ziegler Cooper Architects dated January 9, 2001, more particularly described\n  on Exhibit “D ” attached hereto (the “Preliminary Plans”), subject to normal and acceptable\n  tolerances and pursuant to standard building practices found in residential construction in\n  Houston, Harris County, Texas. The Preliminary Plans are located in Seller's offices. Purchaser\n  acknowledge that all drawings and plans constituting the Preliminary Plans are not the final\n  construction drawings for construction of the Property or the Unit and that refinements may be\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Furthermore, the construction of the Unit is also subject to any changes in the\n  Preliminary Plans and the Plans and Specifications, materials, fixtures or methods that may be\n  required by federal, state or local governmental authority, and other refinements, amendments\n  and adjustments to the Plans and Specifications by Seller that do not affect the fair market\n  value of the Property or the Unit. Seller reserves the right to substitute materials, fixtures\n  or equipment of equal or better quality. In constructing the Unit, Seller shall employ its\n  normal construction schedule, and does not therefore warrant the completion of the Unit\n  on any given date. Accordingly, Seller shall not be liable to Purchaser for any damages\n  resulting from Seller's inability or failure to complete the Unit except for those provided\n  for in Paragraph 17 of the Contract.[ ] Purchaser recognizes that the construction of the\n  Condominium imposes an inherent risk to the health of trees presently located on the Property\n  and hereby acknowledges that Seller cannot guarantee the viability of those trees.\n\n(emphasis added). Paragraph 17 provides in relevant part that:\n\n            In the event that Seller is unable to obtain suitable construction financing,\n            or should any dispute arise between Seller and Purchase prior to Closing\n            concerning construction of the Unit or any other matter relating to the\n            interpretation of this Contract, the Seller shall have the right, upon written\n            notice to the Purchaser, to terminate this Contract. In the event of such\n            termination by Seller, Seller shall cause the Title Company to return the Initial\n            Payment to Purchaser in full satisfaction of Purchaser's relief hereunder; no\n            claims or causes of action shall accrue on behalf of Purchaser; and neither\n            Purchaser nor Seller shall have any further rights or obligations under this\n            Contract.\n\n*7 (emphasis in bold added). Thus, the Chans contend that, under the Contract, Montebello had\nno duty to provide anything whatsoever to them, and, therefore, the Contract is illusory as a matter\nof law. 6\n\n\nB. The Applicable Law\nContracts are valid if there is consideration on each side. See Air Am. Jet Charter Inc. v. Lawhon,\n93 S.W.3d 441, 444 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied) (citing Fed. Sign v.\nTex. S.

Consideration consists of a benefit to the\npromisor or a detriment to the promisee. N. Natural Gas Co. v. Conoco, Inc., 986 S.W.2d 603, 607\n(Tex.1998).

Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\n[14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.). A contract that lacks consideration lacks mutuality of obligation and\nis unenforceable. See Tex. Gas Utils. Co., 460 S.W.2d at 412.\n\n\nC. The Contract is Not Void For Lack of Mutuality of Obligation\nWe do not construe the language of the provision to reflect a lack of mutuality of obligation\nas the Chans contend. The provision the Chans rely on is included in a section concerning the\nconstruction schedule for the Montebello condominium, which was not completed at the time\nthe Contract was executed. This provision is intended to recognize the myriad of factors that can\naffect the construction process and to provide flexibility to Montebello rather than to obligate it to\ncomplete the construction on a specific date or risk breaching the contract. It does not mean that\nMontebello has no obligation to perform at all. Montebello agreed to sell a specific condominium\nunit and the Chans agreed to purchase the unit. As a result, Montebello removed the unit from\nthe market and was thereafter precluded from entertaining other offers for it. Montebello also was\nrequired to sell the unit to the Chans at the specified sales price, which the Chans agreed to pay.\nTherefore, we conclude that the Contract is not void for lack of mutuality. We overrule the Chans'\nthird issue.\n\n\nIII. Did the Trial Court Err in Granting Summary Judgment in Favor of Montebello on\nAll of the Chans' Claims for Affirmative Relief?\nIn their fourth issue, the Chans contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in\nfavor of Montebello on all of their claims for affirmative relief. Specifically, the Chans assert that\nMontebello did not demonstrate it was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law because\nthere are fact issues regarding their affirmative claims of unjust enrichment, breach of contract,\nconversion, negligence, and intentional interference with contract, which the Chans pleaded in\ntheir petition.\n\n *8 To prevail on a traditional motion for summary judgment, the movant must show that there is\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that it entitled to judgment as a matter of law. TEX.R.\nCIV. P. 166a(c); Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex.1985). A defendant\nmoving for summary judgment must conclusively negate at least one essential element of each of\nthe plaintiff's causes of action or conclusively establish each element of an affirmative defense. Sci.\nSpectrum, Inc., v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910, 911 (Tex.1997). Once the movant establishes a right\nto judgment as a matter of law, the burden shifts to the non-movant to produce evidence raising\na genuine issue of material fact. City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671,\n678-79 (Tex.1979). Declaratory judgments decided by summary judgment are reviewed under\nthe same standards of review that govern summary judgments generally. Lidawi v. Progressive\nCounty Mut. Ins. Co., 112 S.W.3d 725, 730 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.).\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     9\n\fChan v. Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\nHere, the Chans do not dispute that they failed to purchase the condominium unit as they\nwere obligated to do under the Contract with Montebello, and do not dispute that Montebello\nwas entitled to some measure of damages as a result. The only dispute between the Chans\nand Montebello was whether the Contract's liquidated damages provision was enforceable. We\nhave already held that the liquidated damages provision was enforceable, and that Montebello\nwas therefore entitled to keep the Initial Payment. All of the Chans' claims against Montebello\nwere premised upon Montebello's allegedly wrongful retention of the Initial Payment. Therefore,\nMontebello demonstrated that, as a matter of law, it was entitled to summary judgment, and the\nburden then shifted to the Chans to raise a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to defeat\nsummary judgment. However, although the Chans pleaded the affirmative claims they identify\nin their petition, they did not assert any of them in response to appellees' motion for summary\njudgment, and they point to no summary judgment evidence raising a fact issue on the claims.\n\nWe therefore overrule the Chans' fourth issue.\n\n\nIV. Did the Trial Court Err in Granting Summary Judgment in Favor of Stewart Title on\nAll of the Chans' Claims for Affirmative Relief?\nIn their fifth issue, the Chans contend that, although Stewart Title was a party to the motion for\nsummary judgment, the motion did not address the Chans' claims against Stewart Title, which\nwere different than the claims against Montebello. Specifically, the Chans assert that their claims\nagainst Stewart Title were based upon an “Earnest Money Receipt” provided to the Chans, which\nstated that the Chans' earnest money would not be dispersed unless all parties agreed. 7 Despite\nthis representation, the Chans contend, Stewart Title paid the earnest money (the Initial Payment)\nto Montebello. The Chans asserted claims against Stewart Title for conversion, negligence,\npromissory estoppel, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty 8 based on\nthese alleged facts.\n\n *9 The Chans' argument in this issue is the same as that made in the previous issue against\nMontebello. The Chans assert that fact issues were raised on each of their claims against Stewart\nTitle precluding summary judgment in its favor. However, the Chans did not raise these claims\nin response to appellees' summary judgment motion or present any evidence to demonstrate that\na genuine issue of material fact existed. Moreover, in appellees' motion for summary judgment,\nappellees showed that, in response to Montebello's instruction, Stewart Title delivered the Initial\nPayment to Montebello in accordance with paragraph 2(d) of the Contract, which provided that\n“the Title Company shall cause the Initial Payment to be delivered promptly to whichever party\nshall become entitled thereto pursuant to the terms of this Contract and without further approval\nfrom either party.”\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                10\n\fChan v. Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\nAs we have previously discussed, the trial court correctly found that Montebello was entitled\nto keep the Initial Payment as liquidated damages under the Contract. Further, appellees\ndemonstrated that, under the Contract, the Chans agreed that Stewart Title was to deliver the Initial\nPayment to Montebello “without further approval from either party.”Thus, the trial court could\nhave correctly concluded that Stewart Title properly delivered the Initial Payment to Montebello.\nAt that point, the burden shifted to the Chans to raise a genuine issue of material fact on their claims\nagainst Stewart Title, all of which were based on the allegedly wrongful delivery of the Initial\nPayment to Montebello without the Chans' consent. In the Chans' response to appellees' motion\nfor summary judgment, they attached a copy of the Earnest Money Receipt and discussed it in\ntheir recitation of the facts, but they did not make any legal argument concerning the document or\nargue that paragraph 2(d) of the Contract did not apply. Moreover, the Chans did not assert any of\ntheir claims in response to appellees' motion for summary judgment, and, other than the “Earnest\nMoney Receipt,” they point to no summary judgment evidence raising a fact issue on the claims.\n\nWe therefore overrule the Chans' fifth issue.\n\n\nV. Did the Trial Court Abuse Its Discretion in Awarding Attorney's Fees and Considering\nAttorney's Affidavit Concerning Fees?\nIn their sixth issue, the Chans contend that the award of attorney's fees is inequitable and unjust\nunder the Declaratory Judgments Act. SeeTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 37.009 (“In any\nproceeding under this chapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's\nfees as are equitable and just.”). In their seventh issue, they contend that the trial court erred in\nfailing to sustain their objections to the affidavit of George Gibson in support of the attorney's\nfees. The Chans brief these issues together, and so we will consider them together.\n\nFirst, the Chans argue that it is fundamentally inequitable and unjust that Montebello, “who hasn't\nsustained any actual damages, and has already been awarded $92,000, should be awarded an\nadditional $20,000 attorneys fees.”The Chans complain that, “for whatever reason [the Chans] did\nnot close, they attempted to negotiate the release of the contract,” but Montebello took advantage\nof them and pushed forward with the scheduling of the walk through and closing with the specific\nintent of obtaining the earnest money. The crux of the Chans' argument appears to be that, even\nthough Montebello prevailed on its claim that it was entitled to keep the liquidated damages as\nprovided in the Contract (and agreed to by the Chans), Montebello is not entitled to attorney's fees\nto compensate it for being required to litigate the issue, because it allegedly did not incur actual\ndamages. The Chans cite no evidence or authorities to support this argument; therefore, we do\nnot consider it. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 38.1(h); Sunnyside Feedyard, L.C. v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 106\nS.W.3d 169, 173 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2003, no pet.)(“Failure to either cite authority or advance\nsubstantive analysis waives the issue on appeal.”). Moreover, Montebello also sought reasonable\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    11\n\fChan v. Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\nattorney's fees as provided under the Contract, 9 and the Chans do not challenge this alternative\nbasis for the award.\n\n *10 Next, the Chans contend that the trial court should have sustained the Chans' objections to\nthe affidavit of George Gibson, one of appellees' attorneys, in support of the attorney's fees, and\nnot considered it in determining the amount of attorney's fees to award. 10 The Chans argue that\nthe affidavit is conclusory because the amounts requested are unreasonable, the affidavit does not\nreflect how much time was spent on the case, and statements concerning anticipated fees for appeal\nand post-judgment motions and other actions are speculative and “not readily controvertible.”\nSeeTEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c) (“A summary judgment may be based on uncontroverted testimonial\nevidence of an interested witness, or of an expert witness as to subject matter concerning which\nthe trier of fact must be guided solely by the opinion testimony of experts, if the evidence is\nclear, positive and direct, otherwise credible and free from contradictions and inconsistencies,\nand could have been readily controverted.”); Trico Techs. Corp. v. Montiel, 949 S.W.2d 308,\n310 (Tex.1997) (same). We review a trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse\nof discretion.Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Malone, 972 S.W.2d 35, 43 (Tex.1998). We\nlikewise review the allowance of attorney's fees for abuse of discretion.Ragsdale v. Progressive\nVoters League, 801 S.W.2d 880, 881 (Tex.1990).\n\nAs the Texas Supreme Court explained in Montiel, the mere fact that an affidavit is self-serving\ndoes not necessarily make the evidence an improper basis for summary judgment. See Montiel,\n949 S.W.2d at 310. Further, whether the evidence contained in an affidavit “could have been\nreadily controverted” does not mean that the summary judgment evidence could have been easily\nand conveniently rebutted, but rather indicates that the testimony could have been effectively\ncountered by opposing evidence. Id. The trial court, as fact finder, may award attorney's fees as\na matter of law based on the uncontradicted testimony of an interested witness, “especially when\nthe opposing party has the means and opportunity of disproving the testimony or evidence and\nfails to do so.”Ragsdale, 801 S.W.2d at 882.\n\nAs one of appellees' attorneys, Gibson averred that he was licensed to practice in Texas and had\npreviously represented clients in connection with commercial litigation in Harris County, he was\nfamiliar with the fees customarily charged by attorneys in Harris county for handling similar\nsuits, and was familiar with the attorneys' services normally required for the proper prosecution\nof lawsuits like the present one. Gibson identified and listed the specific legal services performed\nin connection with the prosecution of the lawsuit, and opined that additional hours of his time\nwould be necessary for post-judgment motions and to enforce the judgment. He further opined\nthat, taking into consideration the complexity of the case, the legal questions involved, and the\ntime involved, a reasonable attorney's fee for the legal services rendered to Montebello would be\n$20,000. Finally, he opined that a reasonable additional attorney's fee for an appeal to the court of\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 12\n\fChan v. Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\nappeals would be $10,000, and if “an application for writ of error” is filed in the Texas Supreme\nCourt, a reasonable additional attorney's fee would be $10,000. 11\n\n *11 The averments in Gibson's affidavit were sufficiently clear and could have been readily\ncontroverted. In response, the Chans asserted their objections, but offered no opposing affidavits or\nother contradicting evidence to challenge Gibson's opinions concerning the attorney's fees incurred\nor to be incurred, and whether or not they were reasonable or necessary. Therefore, we cannot\nsay the trial court abused its discretion to the extent it considered Gibson's affidavit in awarding\nattorney's fees to Montebello. We overrule the Chans' sixth and seventh issues.\n\n\nVI. Did the Trial Court Err in Granting Summary Judgment by Failing to Exclude the\nAffidavit of Jeanette Harris?\nLastly, in their eighth issue, the Chans contend that the trial court erred in granting summary\njudgment by failing to exclude the affidavit of Jeanette Harris, an employee of The Interfin\nCompanies LP, a partner of Montebello. Appellees submitted Harris's affidavit to support the\nmerits of their motion for summary judgment. In her affidavit, Harris made statements concerning\nMontebello's substantial completion of the unit and its performance of all work and obligations\nunder the contract, the Chans' failure to respond to Montebello's attempt to contact the Chans, the\nChans' failure to contact Montebello to schedule a specific time for or attend the closing, and the\nparties' rights and obligations under the Contract. The Chans contend that these statements are\nmerely factual and/or legal conclusions, no extrinsic evidence was offered to support them, and\nthey cannot be readily controverted. 12\n\nHarris averred that she was an employee of The Interfin Companies LP, a partner of Montebello,\nand that the facts stated in her affidavit were within her personal knowledge and were true\nand correct. Her factual statements were supported by documents and correspondence attached\nto appellees' motion for summary judgment, which she referenced in her affidavit, and which\nreflected that Harris either sent the document, was the recipient of the document, or was copied\non the document. Moreover, although the Chans submitted the affidavit of Mrs. Chan in response\nto the motion for summary judgment, Mrs. Chan did not contradict any of the factual statements\nHarris made concerning Montebello's substantial completion of the unit, the Chans' failure to\ncommunicate with Montebello concerning scheduling, or the Chans' failure to attend the closing.\nThus, we cannot say that the trial court erred to the extent that it may have considered the factual\nstatements that could have been controverted by the Chans, but were not.\n\nAlthough some of Harris's statements concerning the legal effect of the Contract, such as her\nassertion that Montebello was entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees and court costs in\naccordance with the Contract, constituted legal conclusions, nothing in the record demonstrates\nthat the trial court considered any conclusory statements or based its decision on them. Moreover,\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 13\n\fChan v. Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\neven if we assume the trial court considered any conclusory statements, because the Chans did not\ndeny that they failed to close on the unit as they were obligated to do under the Contract, many, if\nnot all, of those statements are unnecessary to the trial court's decision. We will not reverse a trial\ncourt's judgment because of an erroneous evidentiary ruling unless the ruling probably caused the\nrendition of an improper judgment. See Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld, 34 S.W.3d 887,\n906 (Tex.2000); Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 972 S.W.2d at 43; TEX.R.APP. P. 44.1(a). The\ncomplaining party must usually show that the whole case turned on the evidence at issue. City of\nBrownsville v. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d 750, 753-54 (Tex.1995). The Chans have not demonstrated\nhow the complained-of statements in the affidavit, if considered by the trial court, probably caused\nthe rendition of an improper judgment. Therefore, we overrule the Chans' eighth issue.\n\n\nConclusion\n*12 We overrule the Chans' issue and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n*    Senior Justice Frank C. Price sitting by assignment.\n\n1    The Chans also asserted that they were entitled to arbitration under the Contract, but arbitration is not an issue in this appeal.\n\n2    The record does not reflect that the trial court ruled on the Chans' objections to the summary judgment proof. Additionally, although it\n        appears the trial court held a hearing on the motion for summary judgment, no reporter's record of the hearing is included in the record.\n3       The language indicating finality was as follows:\n              It is further\n              ORDERED that Defendants are granted judgment in their favor as to all claims and cause of actions by Chiu Moon Chan and Ella\n              Y. Chan, and Chiu Moon Chan and Ella Y. Chan shall take nothing by their claims and cause of actions in this case. It is further\n              ORDERED that Defendants shall be entitled to all writs and processes necessary to enforce this judgment. It is further\n              ORDERED that all other relief not specifically granted herein is denied and that this is a final appealable judgment.\n4       As an initial matter, appellees assert that, because penalty is an affirmative defense and the Chans failed to plead it, the issue is waived.\n        However, the Chans raised the issue of penalty in its response to appellees' motion for summary judgment and in supplemental\n        responses in opposition to the motion. We therefore conclude the issue is preserved for appeal. See Keck, Mahin & Cate v. Nat'l Union\n        Fire Ins. Co., 20 S.W.3d 692, 699 (Tex.2000) (raising affirmative defense in response to motion for summary judgment preserved\n        issue for appeal). Moreover, the record does not reflect that appellees objected to the lack of formal pleading in their responses or\n        otherwise. Unpleaded claims or defenses that are tried by express or implied consent of the parties are treated as if they had been\n        raised by the pleadings. Roark v. Stallworth Oil & Gas, Inc., 813 S.W.2d 492, 495 (Tex.1991) (applying rules of error preservation\n        and trial by consent to issues raised in summary judgment).\n5       In their response, the Chans incorporated by reference a motion to compel and motions to continue the hearing on appellees' motion\n        for summary judgment, and argued that Montebello's failure to respond to their discovery requests denied them the opportunity to\n        fully present summary judgment evidence to support their claims and defenses. However, the referenced motions do not appear in\n        the record, and the Chans do not argue on appeal that the trial court erred by failing to compel any discovery or failing to grant a\n        continuance.\n6       Appellees contend that the Chans failed to preserve this issue for appeal because they did not raise this issue in their response to\n        appellees' motion for summary judgment. However, the Chans did raise the issue in a supplemental response filed before the trial\n        court ruled on the motion, and appellees did not object to it. Therefore, under the facts of this case, we conclude the Chans preserved\n        the issue for appeal. SeeTEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n7       The relevant portion of the document entitled “Earnest Money Receipt” provides as follows: “Notwithstanding any terms of the\n        Contract, Stewart Title does not agree to pay any portion of the Earnest Money to anyone unless uniform written authority to do so\n        is given by all parties to the Contract.”It is signed only by a representative of Stewart Title.\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Montebello Development Co., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2986379\n\n8     In this issue, the Chans also contend that they sued Stewart Title for breach of contract, but the breach of contract claim in the Chans'\n      original petition-the only petition of theirs in the record-is directed only to Montebello.\n9     The Contract provided as follows: “If either party employs an attorney or attorneys to enforce the terms of this Contract, either by\n      arbitration, litigation or negotiation, the losing party agrees to reimburse the prevailing party for reasonable attorneys' fees, arbitration\n      fees, court costs and expenses incurred.”Montebello pleaded for attorney's fees under the Contract and the Declaratory Judgments\n      Act, and sought attorney's fees in the motion for summary judgment under the Contract and Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n      sections 38.001 and 37.009.\n10    The record does not reflect that the trial court ruled on the Chans' objections. We do not presume that objections to summary judgment\n      evidence were overruled when a trial court grants a summary judgment.Seidner v. Citibank (S.D.) N.A., 201 S.W.3d 332, 335 n. 2\n      (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied). But an objection to the substance of a summary judgment affidavit, rather than a\n      defect in the form, is not waived by failure to obtain a ruling from the trial court on the objection. See, e.g., Wadewitz v. Montgomery,\n      951 S.W.2d 464, 466 (Tex.1997) ( “Conclusory statements by an expert are insufficient to support or defeat summary judgment.”).\n11    We note that the trial court awarded the lesser amounts of $7,500 for additional attorney's fees in its judgment.\n\n12    The Chans also argue that Harris does not explain how she has personal knowledge to make several of the statements in her affidavit.\n      However, the Chans did not obtain a ruling on their objections to Harris's affidavit. An objection that an affidavit is not based on\n      personal knowledge is one of form. See Hou-Tex., Inc. v. Landmark Graphics, 26 S.W.3d 103, 112 n. 9 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th\n      Dist.] 2000, no pet.)(“Whether an affiant has personal knowledge and is competent are objections to form.”). Thus, the Chans have\n      waived any complaint of lack of personal knowledge on appeal.

Shami, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 2645720\n\n\n\n\n                                             BACKGROUND\n\nCathy attended a hair show in Mississippi hosted by Appellees for the purpose of having her hair\nstyled by her regular stylist. After arriving at the location, Cathy was told that her stylist would not\nbe able to style her hair, so she agreed to let Andrew Guerra, one of the Appellees, style her hair.\n\nCathy did not model in the show but, instead, sat backstage while her hair was being colored\nand styled. While sitting backstage, a representative of Appellees requested permission to use\nphotographs of Cathy for marketing purposes. Cathy was asked to sign a document granting\nAppellees permission to use her photograph and releasing them from liability for future claims\narising from their services or products. According to Cathy, she was informed that the form she\nsigned permitted use of her photograph, but she was never told she was also releasing Appellees\nfrom future liability.\n\nThe coloring and treatment products were applied to Cathy's hair at approximately 8:45 a.m. and\nremoved at approximately 2:00 p.m. During that time period, multiple individuals worked with\nCathy's hair, sometimes with lengthy intervals between activity. When Cathy expressed concern\nabout the amount of time the chemicals had been on her hair and scalp, she was assured the\nchemicals had not been on her hair too long. Around 2:00 p.m., the chemicals were washed out\nof Cathy's hair.\n\nWhen Cathy awoke the next morning, she noticed that her hair was beginning to fall out. Within\na few weeks, Cathy lost all of the hair on her body. Cathy was diagnosed with alopecia areata\nuniversalis, which is a medical condition that causes rapid loss of all hair on one's body. There\nis no treatment for the condition, and it is likely permanent. It is alleged that Cathy's condition\nmanifested as a result of her prolonged exposure to the chemicals used by Appellees.\n\nIn April of 2011, the Charbonnets filed suit against Appellees. Cathy and Mr. Guerra were deposed\nin February of 2012. In April of 2012, Appellees filed motions for summary judgment. After a\nhearing on the motions, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees. The\nCharbonnets then filed a motion for new trial, and it was overruled by operation of law.\n\n\n\n                                              THE RELEASE\n\nA.

Did the Release Provide Fair Notice?\n *2 In their second point of error, the Charbonnets claim the trial court erred in granting Appellees'\nmotions for summary judgment because there are fact issues concerning whether the release\nsigned by Cathy provided fair notice that she was releasing Appellees from liability for their\nown negligence. The Texas Supreme Court has developed fair-notice requirements that must\nbe met when parties attempt to exculpate themselves, in advance, from liability for their own\nnegligence. Dresser Indus., Inc. v. Page Petroleum, Inc. ., 853 S.W.2d 505, 508 (Tex.1993). A\nparty has provided fair notice of a release from future liability when its release complies with the\nexpress negligence doctrine and is conspicuous. Id. at 508; Tamez v. Sw. Motor Transp., Inc., 155\nS.W.3d 564, 569 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2004, no pet.). Whether a release of liability fulfills the\nrequirements of fair notice is a question of law for the court. Dresser, 853 S.W.2d at 509. Thus,\na release that does not satisfy both fair notice requirements is unenforceable as a matter of law.\nStorage & Processors, Inc. v. Reyes, 134 S.W.3d 190, 192 (Tex.2004).\n\nThe Charbonnets argue only that the release in this case was not conspicuous; therefore we will not\nconsider whether the release satisfies the express negligence doctrine. A release of future liability is\nconspicuous when it draws the attention of a reasonable person looking at the face of the document\nsuch that the person ought to notice it. TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 1.201(b)(10) (West\n2009); Dresser, 853 S.W.2d at 508, 511 (defining conspicuousness as it is defined in the Texas\nBusiness and Commerce Code). When determining whether a release is conspicuous, we consider\nwhether the release is set off by a heading in capital letters and in a different size, type, font, or\ncolor than the surrounding text. TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 1.201(b)(10)(A); see also\nDresser, 853 S.W.2d at 510–11. We also examine whether the language in the body of the release\nis in a different size, type, font, or color from the surrounding text, or whether it is “set off from the\nsurrounding text of the same size by symbols or marks that call attention to the language.”TEX.\nBUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 1.201(b)(10)(B); Littlefield v. Schaefer, 955 S.W.2d 272, 274–\n75 (Tex.1997). Further, releases are often conspicuous when the entire document containing the\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                       3\n\fCharbonnet v. Shami, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 2645720\n\nrelease is a single page and the language of the release appears on the front side of the page and\nnot “hidden under a separate heading or surrounded by unrelated terms.”Dresser, 853 S.W.2d at\n510 (citing Enserch Corp. v. Parker, 794 S.W.2d 2, 9 (Tex.1990)).But see Littlefield, 955 S.W.2d\nat 274 (holding that the release was not conspicuous, despite the fact that release was the only\nwriting on a single-page document, when the text of the release was so small that it was illegible).\n\nAs reproduced below, the document releasing Appellees from liability is a single page and contains\nonly two paragraphs on the front side of the page.\n\n\n\n\n*3 The document is clearly identified as a release and waiver. The first paragraph grants Appellees\npermission to use Cathy's photo and the second paragraph releases Farouk, its representatives, its\nemployees, and its distributors 1 from liability. As is evident, the heading of the second paragraph\nstates: “YOU RELEASE ‘FAROUK’ FROM LIABILITY.” This heading is in capital letters, is\nlarger than the heading of the first paragraph, and is in a bold font. The language in the body of\nthe second paragraph is also in a larger font than the language in the body of the first paragraph\nand is in a bold font, unlike the first paragraph. It also appears the heading and body of the second\nparagraph are in a different font than the heading and body of the first paragraph. Additionally,\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   4\n\fCharbonnet v. Shami, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 2645720\n\napart from the release paragraph, surrounded by multiple lines of space, and directly above Cathy's\nsignature is a sentence in all capital letters that reads: “I AM AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD, HAVE\nREAD AND UNDERSTAND ALL THE PROVISIONS OF THIS RELEASE AND WAIVER,\nAND I AGREE TO ALL ITS CONTENTS AS EVIDENCED BY MY SIGNATURE BELOW.”\n\nRelying on Littlefield v. Schaefer, the Charbonnets argue that the text in the body of the second\nparagraph is “nearly illegible” and that “[a]lthough capital letters are present in a few areas of\nDefendants' document, the capital letters do not effectively contrast one portion of the release from\nanother.”Specifically, the Charbonnets point to language in Littlefield stating that larger font in\nthe heading of a release is not, alone, sufficient to make the release conspicuous. Littlefield, 955\nS.W.2d at 275. Although we do not dispute the truth of this general proposition, it must be placed\nin context. The release in Littlefield contained larger headings indicating that the text was a release\nof liability, but the body of the text was printed in “miniscule typeface” that was smaller than\nthe surrounding text and was placed in the bottom left corner of the document. Id. at 274–75.The\nstatement cited by the Charbonnets was explaining that merely using larger headings indicating\na release of liability will not suffice when the signatory has no idea what claims he is releasing\nbecause the text is too small to read. Id. at 275.The release in this case is nothing like the release\nin Littlefield.The release signed by Cathy contained not only a larger heading, but also text of a\nlegible size in a bold font.\n\nThe Charbonnets also appear to assert that Cathy was misled about the contents of the document,\nclaiming that she was informed only that the document granted Appellees permission to use her\nphotograph. The Charbonnets never alleged fraud, nor did they point to any authority holding\nthat a less-than-complete or misleading description of a document's contents can defeat a release\nthat provides fair notice of its contents. Thus, any such contention is waived by the Charbonnets.\nTEX.R.APP. P. 33.1; TEX.R.APP. P. 38.1. Because the document containing the release was only\nabout half of a page in length and contained only two paragraphs, and because the language of the\nrelease was legible and distinguished from the surrounding texts in multiple ways, we conclude\nthe release signed by Cathy was sufficiently conspicuous to put a reasonable person on notice of\nits existence and terms.\n\n\nC. Can a Pre–Injury Waiver of Liability Release Appellees from Liability for a Subsequent\nMisrepresentation?\n *4 In their fourth appellate point, the Charbonnets argue that a pre-injury waiver of claims cannot\nrelease a party from liability for misrepresentations or warranties made after the waiver is signed.\nThe Charbonnets cite no authority supporting their contention that a valid waiver does not operate\nagainst future wrongdoings of Appellees. Moreover, since a pre-injury waiver is designed to\nrelease a party in advance from liability, future wrongdoings would generally be encompassed\nwithin the scope of the waiver. Dresser, 853 S.W.2d at 508.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     5\n\fCharbonnet v. Shami, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 2645720\n\nIn this case, the Charbonnets released Appellees from any claim “arising directly or indirectly out\nof any hair or beauty services performed” regardless of whether the conduct giving rise to the\nclaim occurred then or in the future. A release “operates to extinguish the claim or cause of action\nas effectively as would a prior judgment between the parties and is an absolute bar to any right\nof action on the released matter.”Dresser, 853 S.W.3d at 508.In light of the existing law on this\nissue, and in the absence of any contrary authority provided by the Charbonnets, we overrule their\nfourth appellate issue.\n\n\nD. Was the Release Invalid As Against Public Policy to the Extent It Purported to Waive\nClaims of Gross Negligence?\nIn their third point of error, the Charbonnets contend Texas public policy prohibits Appellees\nfrom obtaining an advance waiver of their liability for gross negligence. Appellees assert that the\nCharbonnets have not preserved this claim for appellate review because they did not specifically\nplead gross negligence as a cause of action or raise the issue in their response to Appellees' motions\nfor summary judgment. The Charbonnets argue that their factual allegations put Appellees on\nnotice of their gross-negligence claim and that gross negligence is only negligence of a different\ndegree, not type, so it does not have to be separately pleaded. Assuming, without deciding,\nthe Charbonnets' factual assertions in their pleadings were sufficient to permit proof of gross\nnegligence at trial, the Charbonnets' argument regarding the public policy of prohibiting waiver\nof gross negligence is not properly preserved for our review.\n\nThe purpose of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c) is to require motions for summary judgment,\nresponses, and other replies to provide adequate information to the opposing party and to define\nthe issues to be determined for summary judgment. McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist., 858\nS.W.2d 337, 341 (Tex.1993).“Issues not expressly presented to the trial court by written motion,\nanswer[,] or other response shall not be considered on appeal as grounds for reversal.”TEX.R.\nCIV. P. 166a(c). After the movant has presented a legally sufficient motion for summary judgment,\n“the non-movant must expressly present to the trial court, by written answer or response, any\nissues defeating the movant's entitlement.”McConnell, 858 S.W.2d at 343 (citing City of Houston\nv. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex.1979)).“[T]hese rules further the policy of\nseeking clarity and simplicity in summary judgment practice.”Id. at 341.\n\n *5 Appellees' motions for summary judgment clearly stated that they were premised on the\naffirmative defense of release of liability. Indeed, Appellees expressly stated that “Plaintiff signed\na release that expressly bars any claims against Farouk and its distributor's [for] negligence, gross\nnegligence, misconduct, product liability, or strict liability.”This and similar statements gave the\nCharbonnets notice that Appellees were asserting release of liability as an affirmative defense to\nany possible claim of gross negligence. As a result, the Charbonnets had an obligation to present in\nwriting any and all reasons why the asserted affirmative defense did not bar their gross negligence\nclaim.\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    6\n\fCharbonnet v. Shami, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 2645720\n\n\n\nThe Charbonnets' response argued that summary judgment was improper because there had not\nbeen adequate time for discovery and because the release was not conspicuous. The Charbonnets'\nresponse did not, however, present any argument regarding the possible public policy in Texas\nprohibiting an advance waiver of liability for gross negligence. Thus, this argument was not\npreserved for our review. TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c); see also Rosen v. National Hot Rod Ass'n, No.\n14–94–00775–CV, 1995 WL 755712, at *6 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] Dec. 21, 1995, writ\ndenied) (not designated for publication) (concluding that the appellant's argument that summary\njudgment was improper because the release was against public policy was not preserved for review\nbecause it was not presented to the trial court in the appellant's response).\n\nThe Charbonnets presented their public-policy argument for the first time in their motion for new\ntrial. For the reasons explained below, however, the motion for new trial also did not preserve the\nclaim for appellate review. We review a trial court's decision on a motion for new trial for an abuse\nof discretion. In re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, 290 S.W.3d 204, 213 (Tex.2009).\n\nWhen a motion for new trial is filed after the rendition of summary judgment, “a trial court has\nthe discretion to consider the grounds in a post-judgment motion and supporting proof[,] and\nreaffirm its summary judgment based on the entire record.”TIMOTHY PATTON, SUMMARY\nJUDGMENTS IN TEXAS § 7.06[1] (3d ed.2012); see also Auten v. DJ Clark, Inc., 209 S.W.3d\n695, 702 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.). The trial court also has the discretion\nto simply deny a motion filed after the entry of summary judgment without considering its\nsubstance. First Gibraltar Bank, FSB v. Farley, 895 S.W.2d 425, 430 (Tex.App.-San Antonio\n1995, writ denied). In the latter situation, an appellate court need only consider arguments and\nevidence presented prior to the summary-judgment hearing. TIMOTHY PATTON, SUMMARY\nJUDGMENTS IN TEXAS § 7.06 [1] (3d ed.2012); see also Laurel v. Herschap, 5 S.W.3d 799, 802\n(Tex.App.-San Antonio 1999, no pet.).“Thus, the efficacy of a post-judgment motion to preserve\na complaint for appellate review depends upon whether the trial court affirmatively considers the\nnew grounds and proof as memorialized by a written order.”TIMOTHY PATTON, SUMMARY\nJUDGMENTS IN TEXAS § 7.06[1] (3d ed.2012) (citing Auten, 209 S.W.3d at 701; Stephens v.\nDolcefino, 126 S.W.3d 120, 133–34 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied)).\n\n *6 The Charbonnets' motion for new trial was overruled by operation of law. Because the trial\ncourt did not sign a new order affirmatively indicating its consideration of the Charbonnets'\nmotion-for-new-trial claims, the Charbonnets' contention that they asserted a claim for gross\nnegligence and that it could not be released under the public policy of Texas was not preserved\nfor appellate review.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CIV. P. 166a(a), (i); Reynolds v. Murphy, 188 S.W.3d 252, 258 n. 8 (Tex.App.-\nFort Worth 2006, pet. denied). Furthermore, even if this were an exceptional case where discovery\nshould be permitted before a traditional motion for summary judgment can be granted, we hold\nthat the parties had an adequate opportunity to obtain discovery. See Reynolds, 188 S.W.3d at 258\nn. 8 (citing Nelson v. PNC Mortgage Corp., 139 S.W.3d 442, 446 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2004, no pet.))\n(explaining that a traditional motion for summary judgment may not be appropriately granted in\nsome rare, factually specific cases if there has not been adequate time for discovery).\n\nIn order to preserve a claim of inadequate opportunity for discovery, the party requesting additional\ntime must file an affidavit stating its reasons for needing additional discovery or a verified\nmotion for continuance. Tenneco Inc. v. Enterprise Prods. Co., 925 S.W.2d 640, 647 (Tex.1996).\nCharbonnet preserved her claim by filing a verified motion for continuance that sought more time\nto obtain depositions of Appellees' corporate representatives and others. This motion was denied\nby the trial court.\n\nWe review a trial court's denial of a motion for continuance for an abuse of discretion. Joe v.\nTwo Thirty Nine Joint Venture, 145 S.W.3d 150, 161 (Tex.2004); Tenneco, 925 S.W.2d at 647.\n“A trial court abuses its discretion when it reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to\namount to a clear and prejudicial error of law.”Joe, 145 S.W.3d at 161. When reviewing a trial\ncourt's denial of a motion for continuance seeking additional time for discovery, we consider the\nfollowing nonexclusive list of factors: (1) how long the suit has been pending; (2) the materiality of\nand reason for the discovery sought; and (3) whether due diligence has been exercised to obtain the\ndiscovery sought. Id.;City of San Antonio v. En Seguido, Ltd., 227 S.W.3d 237, 240 (Tex.App.-San\nAntonio 2007, no pet.).Rule 166a“does not require that discovery be completed, only that there\nwas adequate time for discovery.”Rankin v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., 319 S.W.3d 58, 67 (Tex.App.-\nSan Antonio 2010, no pet.).\n\n*7 All three of the factors mentioned above weigh against the Charbonnets. First, the\nCharbonnets' suit was filed on April 15, 2011, and the first motion for summary judgment was\nnot filed until April 27, 2012. In addition, no hearing on the motions for summary judgment was\nheld until June 25, 2012. Accordingly, the Charbonnets had over a year to conduct discovery. The\nCharbonnets contend they need additional time for discovery because the last answer to their latest\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    8\n\fCharbonnet v. Shami, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 2645720\n\namended petition was filed only three weeks before the motion for summary judgment was filed.\nThis fact, however, is of little significance. The motions for summary judgment in this case were\npredicated on the affirmative defense of release of liability, and release of liability was first asserted\nas a defense to the Charbonnets' claim in an original answer filed on May 13, 2011. Therefore, the\nCharbonnets had knowledge of and could have sought discovery related to the release for almost\na year before the motions for summary judgment were filed.\n\nWith regard to the materiality of and reason for needing additional discovery, the Charbonnets\nprovide no specific reason why the additional depositions are material to their case. Instead, the\nCharbonnets generally assert that they need the deposition of various corporate representatives\nand “other individuals with knowledge of relevant facts surrounding the putative release.”The\nCharbonnets do not name most of the corporate representatives or “other individuals” they seek\nto depose, nor do they state what information they expect any of these individuals to provide.\nSeeTEX.R. CIV. P. 252. Moreover, it is unlikely that any further testimony or evidence would aid\nthe trial court in its decision on Appellees' motions for summary judgment because the validity of\na release of liability is a question of law to be decided by the court. Dresser, 853 S.W.2d at 509.\n\nFinally, the Charbonnets have wholly failed to make a showing of due diligence. Although\nthe Charbonnets contend they had an agreement with Appellees that multiple other corporate\nrepresentatives and witnesses would be produced for depositions, they cite no evidence of such\nagreement. In contrast, Appellees point to a Rule 11 Agreement made on January 9, 2012\nthat shows the parties' agreement that Farouk would produce Andrew Guerra for deposition in\nFebruary. The agreement also reflects Appellees' intention to “file their summary judgment motion\non the release and have it set for hearing as soon as possible.”Thus, this agreement reflects the\nCharbonnets' intention to allow the summary-judgment motions to proceed in exchange for the\nopportunity to depose Guerra.\n\nBased on the length of time the Charbonnets had notice Appellees were asserting the release of\nliability as an affirmative defense, the vague and general assertions of the need for additional\ndiscovery, and the absence of evidence suggesting the exercise of due diligence in obtaining\ndiscovery prior to the filing of the motion for summary judgment or the hearing thereon, we\nconclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Charbonnets' motion for\ncontinuance.\n\n\n\n                                              CONCLUSION\n\n *8 Because the release signed by Cathy was conspicuous and because the Charbonnets had\nadequate time to obtain discovery, we conclude the trial court did not err in granting summary\njudgment in favor of Appellees. The Charbonnets' remaining claims were not properly preserved\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                       9\n\fCharbonnet v.

Without reaching the merits, we hold that this action is not within the original\njurisdiction granted to this Court by either the Texas Constitution or the Legislature, and deny the\nmotion for leave to file the petition because Relators have an adequate remedy at law.\n\nBill Chenault, Roy Beene, and Miles Appleberry (Relators) filed an original petition in this Court\nseeking a declaration that the attorney occupation tax is unconstitutional, an injunction against\nthe officials responsible for collecting the tax, and writs prohibiting enforcement of the tax. 1\nRelators, members of the State Bar of Texas, argue that the statute's enforcement provision, which\nautomatically suspends the license of any attorney who does not timely pay the tax, deprives\nattorneys of their right to a full impartial hearing prior to the imposition of any sanction. Relators\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  1\n\fChenault v. Phillips, 914 S.W.2d 140 (1996)\n39 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 204\n\nfurther contend that the statute improperly infringes on this Court's inherent power to regulate\nthe legal profession in Texas, and that it violates the separation of powers provision of Article\nII, section one of the Texas Constitution by delegating the tax collection powers of the executive\nbranch to the judicial branch. Relators argue that this Court has jurisdiction over this original action\nunder Article III of the Texas Constitution, sections 22.001–.002 of the Government Code, and\nRules 121 and 122 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n [1] [2] [3] This Court's jurisdiction, like that of all Texas courts, is conferred solely by the\nTexas Constitution and state statutes. We do not have jurisdiction to decide any case absent an\nexpress constitutional or statutory grant. See Pope v. Ferguson, 445 S.W.2d 950, 952 (Tex.1969),\ncert. denied, 397 U.S. 997, 90 S.Ct. 1138, 25 L.Ed.2d 405 (1970). A request for declaratory relief\nalone does not establish jurisdiction in this Court. We have held that the Uniform Declaratory\nJudgments Act, TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE §§ 37.001–.011, is not a grant of jurisdiction,\nbut “merely a procedural device for deciding cases already within a court's jurisdiction.” State v.\nMorales, 869 S.W.2d 941, 947 (Tex.1994); see also Texas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control\nBd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex.1993). Likewise, we may not consider the merits of Relators'\nrequests for injunctions, writs of prohibition, and other relief under Rules 121 and 122 in a case\nnot otherwise properly before the Court. See Texas Employers' Ins. Ass'n v. Kirby, 137 Tex. 106,\n152 S.W.2d 1073, 1073 (1941).\n\n [4] [5] Relators also seek a writ of mandamus. Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy and\ngenerally is not available from any court in this state when a party has an adequate legal remedy.\nWalker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex.1992); Holloway v. Fifth Court of Appeals, 767\nS.W.2d 680, 684 (Tex.1989); State v. Walker, 679 S.W.2d 484, 485 (Tex.1984). Relators may\nfile their challenge to the Attorney Occupation Tax in district court and appeal any adverse ruling\nthrough the ordinary appellate process. They have not met their burden of showing that pursuing\ntheir claims first in the trial court will cause them to suffer any immediate harm that would entitle\nthem to mandamus relief under the Walker standard.\n\n *142 [6] [7] Moreover, this Court will not issue an original writ of mandamus absent a\n“compelling reason.” TEX.R.APP.P. 121(a); LaRouche v. Hannah, 822 S.W.2d 632, 633–34\n(Tex.1992); Sears v. Bayoud, 786 S.W.2d 248, 249–50 (Tex.1990). Relators assert as compelling\nreasons for the invocation of this Court's original jurisdiction the need to protect this Court's role\nas the ultimate supervisory authority over the State Bar of Texas, the presence of state officers as\nnecessary parties in the suit, and the statewide importance of the issue. None of these proffered\njurisdictional bases presents a compelling reason for this Court to exercise its original jurisdiction.\n\nRelators cite State Bar of Texas v. Gomez, 891 S.W.2d 243 (Tex.1994), as authority for the relief\nthey seek. In Gomez, several indigent litigants brought an action in district court to mandate that\nthe State Bar of Texas or this Court require all Texas attorneys to provide pro bono legal services.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    2\n\fChenault v. Phillips, 914 S.W.2d 140 (1996)\n39 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 204\n\nCentral to our decision in that case was this Court's exclusive administrative authority to regulate\nthe practice of law in Texas, an authority that “is derived from both statutory and inherent powers.”\nId. at 245. The State Bar, we held, is by itself powerless to address the harm alleged by the indigent\nlitigants, as its authority in this regard is limited to proposing regulations to the Court. We then\nrejected any attempt to involve the district court in the regulation of the practice of law: “[T]o\nthe extent the remedies are sought against the Supreme Court, they would clearly impinge on the\nCourt's exclusive authority to regulate the practice of law.... No subordinate court in Texas has the\npower to usurp our authority or responsibility in this area.” Id. at 246.\n\nRelators interpret this language as this Court's assumption of exclusive original jurisdiction over\nany action affecting attorneys in Texas. In so doing, they misconstrue our decision in Gomez.\nFirst, we observed that the Court's inherent powers, such as the power to regulate the bar,\nare administrative powers, not jurisdictional powers. Id. at 245. We then held that a district\ncourt could not impose a new requirement on Texas attorneys because “a district court has no\nauthority to assume this Court's authority to regulate the legal profession.” Id. at 246. Unlike the\nplaintiffs in Gomez, Relators do not seek imposition of new regulations on lawyers in Texas,\nbut rather challenge the constitutionality of a statute that affects lawyers. Yet, as we noted in\nGomez, constitutional challenges to rules enacted by this Court must be brought in the district\ncourt and heard by this Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. “Had this Court\nactually promulgated rules establishing a pro bono program and had Gomez challenged the\nconstitutionality of such rules, the district court would have jurisdiction to decide, in the first\ninstance, whether such rules met constitutional standards.... Such a case would be justiciable\nbecause the district court would be capable of rendering a judgment that accords the parties\ncomplete relief, subject of course to appellate review.” Id. at 246. Analogously, Relators must\nfollow the same procedure in challenging the constitutionality of the Attorney Occupation Tax. A\nlitigant may not bring such a claim in the first instance in this Court.\n\nAccordingly, without hearing oral argument, see Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 122, a\nmajority of this Court overrules Relators' motion for leave to file an original petition for writ of\nmandamus and writs pursuant to Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 121 and 122.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n39 Tex.

(RPM) to purchase 144 residential lots over a three-year period. Title to the\nlots was to be acquired as each one was “taken down” or closed. Appellant was also required to\npay interest to appellee and property taxes on any of the 144 lots for which legal title had not\nbeen acquired.\n\nBetween October 1978 and October 1980, appellant “took down” only 30 lots. Additionally,\nappellant stopped making tax and interest payments to appellee. Consequently, in October, 1980\nappellee notified appellant that the contract was cancelled. In response thereto, appellant filed suit\nalleging that appellee had breached his contract by failing to deliver lots with construction of the\nroads in accordance with the City of Stafford and Federal Housing Authority (FHA) specifications.\nAppellee filed a counter-claim, alleging that appellant's failure to pay property taxes and interest\nconstituted a material breach of the contract.\n\nThe jury found that appellant materially breached the contract and found that appellee suffered\ndamages in the amount of $71,820 based on the lost profits on the non-sale of 114 residential lots.\n\nIn its first two points of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in entering judgment\nbased on the jury's response to special issue numbers 11 and 12 because appellant did not have\na contractual obligation to pay property taxes as they accrued or to pay interest to appellee in\nOctober 1980. Thus, as a matter of law, such failure did not constitute a material breach of the\ncontract in question.\n\nIn response to special issues 11 and 12, the jury specifically found that appellant's failure to pay\ninterest and property taxes as they accrued to appellee in October 1980 constituted a material\nbreach of the contract.\n\nAppellant relies on his contractual interpretation of paragraphs II (b) and (c) of the contract of\nsale to substantiate his contention. These paragraphs describe the manner in which the purchase\nprice of the lots shall be paid:\n\n  (c) The balance of the total purchase price shall be payable to Seller as follows:\n\n  (1) The sum of $310,500.00 (representing remaining 90% of lot price multiplied by 30 lots) shall\n  be paid to Seller 60 days after notification to Buyer by Seller, which shall include certification\n  of lot completion, at which time Seller shall convey to Buyer by general warranty deed, insured\n  by owners title policy, good and indefeasible title to Buyer to 30 lots selected by Buyer, and\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Replacement Parts..., 679 S.W.2d 721 (1984)\n\n\n\n\n  (4) The sum of $351,900.00 (representing remaining 90% of lot purchase price multiplied by\n  34 lots) shall be paid to Seller within 1095 days of said notification to Buyer by Seller of lot\n  completion at which time Seller shall convey title as above described to remaining 34 lots.\n\n  Provided however, (a) Buyer may at any time tender to Seller $10,350.00 per lot and demand\n  that Seller convey title to lots selected by Buyer and the purchase price of any lots so acquired\n  shall be counted in reduction of the next due installment of Buyer to Seller as above described;\n  (b) Buyer shall pay all taxes as due from the date of lot completion and furnish Seller with copy\n  of said paid tax receipts and (c) Buyer shall pay Seller interest at the rate of 10% per annum\n  on the unpaid balance outstanding, such interest to commence upon the date of lot completion\n  and to be payable quarterly thereafter.\n\nSpecifically, the appellant contends for the first time on appeal, that the last paragraph cited above,\nwhich describes the appellant's duty to pay taxes and interest to appellee, is part of paragraph II (c).\n\nThe contract also provides as follows:\n\n           Provided that the obligations of Seller as enumerated in paragraphs (a)–(f) of\n           Paragraph I on pages 1–2 of this Contract *724 shall be conditions precedent to\n           the obligations of Buyer as set forth in Paragraphs II(b) and (c) of this Contract\n           with respect to each group of lots to be purchased thereunder.\n\nAppellant urges this court to find that the above contractual language requires the seller (appellee)\nto fulfill certain “conditions precedent” before the buyer (appellant) will be responsible for\npayment of taxes and interest as allegedly required in paragraph II (c). Some of the conditions\nwhich the seller is required to fulfill are described in paragraph I(a):\n\n  Seller agrees to the following:\n\n  (a) Seller shall clear the street right-of-way and utility easements within Kingsway, it being\n  understood that (1) any additional clearing shall be done by Buyer at its expense, and (2) Seller\n  shall minimize damage to the trees within Kingsway; (b) each lot or reserve being conveyed\n  shall be free of trash, garbage, or any improvements not contemplated hereby, and except for\n  clearing of trees, be in a condition suitable for commencement of construction of single family\n  detached housing; ...\n\nAppellant claims that because appellee failed to keep each lot free of trash, the appellee had not\nfulfilled the conditions which activate appellant's responsibility for taxes and interest. The appellee\nargues that the language does not constitute a condition precedent, but merely a covenant, the\nbreach of which might be a defense to any contract action by appellee against appellant.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Replacement Parts..., 679 S.W.2d 721 (1984)\n\n\n\n\n [1] [2] As a general rule, where neither party has alleged that the contract is vague or ambiguous,\nthe construction of the contract is a question of law for the court. City of Pinehurst v. Spooner\nAddition Water Co., 432 S.W.2d 515 (Tex.1968). The court also construes the meaning of contracts\nwhere neither party makes allegations specifying the language subject to different interpretation,\nso that the opposing party is prepared to offer evidence explaining the meaning. Sale v. Contran\nCorporation, 486 S.W.2d 161 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas 1972, writ ref'd n.r.e.). The court is required\nto give effect to the intention of the parties as expressed or as it is apparent in the writing. Pitts v.\nAshcraft, 586 S.W.2d 685 (Tex.Civ.App.—Corpus Christi 1979, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\n [3] In the instant case, reading the contract as a whole and considering the surrounding\ncircumstances, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the paragraph which contained\nthe language, “Buyer shall pay all taxes as due from the date of lot completion and furnish Seller\nwith copy of said paid tax receipts”, was not part of paragraph II (b) and (c) of the contract which\nset forth the conditions precedent to the obligation of buyer to pay the balance of the purchase\nprice. Instead, the court could have construed the provision as being a written covenant, contained\nin a separate paragraph.\n\n [4] The passage containing the language starts a new paragraph which introduces an alternative\nmethod of purchasing the lots, and outlines the seller's obligation to pay taxes and interest. If the\nparties had intended this section to be part of paragraph II (c), they could have easily included it\nnumbered as (c)(5) or clearly shown that it was part of (c)(4). Moreover, it is well established that\nif the intent of the parties is doubtful, or if a condition would impose an absurd or impossible result,\nthen the agreement will be interpreted as creating a covenant rather than a condition. Hohenberg\nBros. Co. v. George E. Gibbons & Co., 537 S.W.2d 1, 3 (Tex.1976).\n\nIn the case at bar, to hold that the appellee's three-year obligation to make tax and interest payments\non the lot was suspended until appellant cleared the occasional debris that accumulated on the lots\nwould impose “an absurd result” particularly in light of the other conditions which suspend tax\nand interest payments.\n\nParagraph II(b) provides for payment only upon the completion of the development of 144 lots.\nParagraph II(c) provides that the balance of the total purchase price is only payable sixty days\nafter seller notifies *725 the buyer by sending certification of lot completion and conveying to\nbuyer a general warranty deed.\n\nThe paragraph clearly demonstrates the parties' intention to condition appellant's obligation to\npay the balance on the lots on their certification as being complete. Since such intent is not\nclearly demonstrated in the paragraph requiring the payment of taxes and interest, we find that\nthe appellee's obligation to pay taxes and interest was not part of paragraph II(b) or (c) and was\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Points of error\none and two are overruled.\n\nIn points of error three, four, and five, appellant contends that the trial court erred in granting\njudgment in favor of appellee for damages because there was no evidence, or alternatively\ninsufficient evidence of the “benefit of the bargain” or the value of the property at the time appellee\nknew or should have known of the breach as compared to the value the property should have had\nat that time.\n\n[5] Generally, the measure of damages for breach of contract is the amount necessary to place\nplaintiff in a financial position equal to that which it would have had if the contract had been\nperformed by both parties. Little Darling Corp. v. Ald, Inc., 566 S.W.2d 347 (Tex.Civ.App.—\nDallas 1978, no writ). Under this standard, the injured party is compensated only for the damages\nor loss actually sustained. North American Corp. v. Allen, 636 S.W.2d 797 (Tex.App.—Corpus\nChristi 1982, no writ).\n\n[6] Lost profits are recoverable under this standard if the evidence shows that the loss of profits\nwas a material and probable consequence of the breach of the act complained of and the amount\ndue is shown with sufficient certainty. Id. at 799; see also Little Darling Corp., supra.\n\n [7] Generally, lost profits are properly calculated by deducting the costs of the injured party's\nperformance supported by data from the actual contract price. Wilfin, Inc. v. Williams, 615 S.W.2d\n242, 244 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.). However, a witness may also provide\nevidence of lost profits by testifying as to what his profit would have been, based on his knowledge\nof the cost of performance of each element of the contract and subtracting the total of such costs\nfrom the contract price. Wilfin, Inc., supra at 245.\n\nIn the instant case, the jury was given the following instructions for determining the damages:\n\n\n\n                                              INSTRUCTION\n\n  In connection with the following Special Issue, you are only to consider such damage, if any,\n  that you find from a preponderance of the evidence was shown to have been the natural,\n  probable, and foreseeable consequence of Champion Equity's conduct or to have been within\n  the contemplation of the parties. You may consider only those losses, if any, the payment of\n  which would place R.P.M., Inc. as nearly as possible in the position it would have occupied\n  had Champion Equity performed the contract, if, indeed it did not. You may consider only such\n  damage, if any, that was actually sustained and you shall not speculate as to damages which,\n  although possible, have not been proved by a preponderance of the credible evidence.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Replacement Parts..., 679 S.W.2d 721 (1984)\n\n\n\n  The jury was also to consider only such damage, if any, that they found from\n\n              a preponderance of the evidence would give Champion Equity the benefit of\n              its bargain as of the date Champion Equity knew of the breach or should have\n              known of the breach, if any, of R.P.M., Inc. You are further instructed that\n              benefit of its bargain is the difference between the value of what Champion\n              Equity had at the time it knew or should have known of the breach and the\n              value of what Champion Equity should have had at that time.\n\n   The jury was instructed to consider only such losses that would place appellee in the position\n   it would have occupied had the breach not occurred. According to this instruction, lost profits\n   would be included *726 within the foreseeable consequences of a lost sale, and would be\n   recoverable if supported by the evidence. Wilfin, Inc., supra.\n [8] Evidence of appellee's lost profits was provided by Mr. Webster, who was the president and\nsole stockholder in appellee's corporation. Mr. Webster testified without objection that the costs of\nappellee's performance included a 10% down payment on its lots owned by Mr. Shipwash, which\nwere to be resold by appellee to appellant.\n\nThe appellee had contracted to pay Mr. Shipwash $9720 per lot. Appellee then contemplated\nselling these same lots to appellant for $11,500 each.\n\nAppellant had paid a down payment of 10% or $1,150 per lot to appellee, and had contracted to pay\nthe remaining $10,350 per lot over a period of three years. Appellee had anticipated that his gross\nprofit would be $630 per lot. Appellant's breach of contract, after purchasing only 30 of the 144\nlots, caused appellee to lose $630 profit on each of the remaining 114 lots, or a total of $71,820.\nMr. Webster's testimony provided competent evidence of appellee's “benefit of the bargain” which\nincluded lost profits. Appellant's third, fourth, and fifth points of error are overruled.\n\nIn its sixth point of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in awarding appellee damages\nbecause the damages awarded were barred by the liquidated damages clause contained in the\ncontract for deed.\n\nThe contract for deed provided as follows:\n\n           Seller shall give Buyer thirty (30) days written notice of any default hereunder\n           and should the Buyer fail to correct such default within ten (10) days from receipt\n           of notice, Seller, its successors or assigns, shall have, as its sole remedy the right\n           to declare this agreement terminated and Buyers earnest money forfeited. In the\n           event of default by Seller, Buyer's sole remedy is that the earnest money shall\n           be refunded and this agreement terminated.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Replacement Parts..., 679 S.W.2d 721 (1984)\n\n\n\n\nAppellant contends that this provision limited damages for any default by buyer to the earnest\nmoney paid to appellee. The jury found in response to special issue no. 15 that the earnest money\ntotalled $165,600. Appellant further contends that since the above provision is enforceable as\nliquidated damages, and the appellee was in possession of the earnest money, the trial court was\nbarred from awarding additional damages to appellee. The appellant further contends that the\nprovision is unenforceable because it provides for a penalty to secure performance of the contract.\n\nThe leading case relating to appellant's contention is Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d\n484, 486 (1952) which sets out the applicable rule in cases similar to the instant one:\n\n  In those cases in which courts enforce stipulations of the parties as a measure of damages for the\n  breach of covenants, the principle of just compensation is not abandoned and another principle\n  substituted therefor. What courts really do in those cases is to permit the parties to estimate in\n  advance the amount of damages, provided they adhere to the principle of just compensation.\n  Restatement of Contracts, Sec. 339, accurately expresses the rule as follows:\n\n     (1) An agreement, made in advance of breach fixing the damages therefor, is not enforceable\n     as a contract and does not affect the damages recoverable for the breach, unless\n\n     (a) the amount so fixed is a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm that is\n     caused by the breach, and\n\n     (b) the harm that is caused by the breach is one that is incapable or very difficult of accurate\n     estimation. (emphasis added)\n\nIn Stewart, the court held that the “stipulated damage provision” in a lease would be treated as\na penalty because the provision was not narrowly drawn or limited to the breach of any one\nmajor covenant, but could also be triggered by the breach of a trivial or unimportant covenant.\nThe Texas *727 Supreme Court emphasized that the provision did not adhere to the rule of\n“just compensation.” Id. See also Bethel v. Butler Drilling, 635 S.W.2d 834 (Tex.App.—Houston\n[14th Dist.] 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.); (Court refused to uphold a liquidated damages provision\nin a lease, which was triggered equally by the nonpayment of rent or the breach of any other\ncovenant); Mayfield v. Hicks, 575 S.W.2d 571 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.);\n(Court condemned a similar provision as a penalty because the contract provided the same\nreparation for breach of each and every covenant); Loggins Const. Co. v. Stephen F. Austin St.\nUniv., 543 S.W.2d 682 (Tex.Civ.App.—Tyler 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\n [9] Under the principle of just compensation, “The general rule is that if such a provision is\nfor a penalty to secure performance of the contract, it is unenforceable and the party claiming\na breach is required to prove his actual damages.” However, if the parties actually intended the\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   7\n\fCommunity Development Service, Inc. v. Replacement Parts..., 679 S.W.2d 721 (1984)\n\n\n\nprovision to constitute their estimate of the damages that would actually be sustained by the party\nharmed by the breach, and the amount so fixed is a reasonable estimate of just compensation\nfor the harm contemplated by the breach, and the amount of the damages is incapable or hard to\ndetermine, it is enforceable. The parties' intention in making the provision is not controlling in\nthis respect. Loggins Construction Co., supra; Brace v. Dante, 466 S.W.2d 66, 69 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—Dallas 1971, no writ).\n\n [10] Applying this principle of law to the contractual provision before this court, we conclude\nthat the parties intended that the provision constitute an estimate of their damages in the event of a\nbreach. However, the amount fixed is not a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm\ncaused by any breach of the contract.\n\nThe provision states that “upon any default hereunder by the buyer” or “in the event of default”\nby the seller, the sole remedy shall be the retention, or refund respectively, of any earnest money\ntendered. The defect in this provision which makes it a penalty rather than a liquidated damage\nprovision, is that upon the occurrence of any default, even a minor one, by either party, the injured\nparty may terminate the contract and keep over $160,000 in earnest money as damages.\n\n [11] A provision becomes a penalty if it provides for unreasonable damages for trivial breaches\nas well as reasonable damages for major breaches. Stewart, supra; Bethel, supra; and Mayfield,\nsupra. It is immaterial that the actual breach was for default in tax and interest payments. Mayfield,\nsupra. If the seller failed to keep any one lot entirely free from trash, or if the buyer paid the taxes\nbut failed to furnish seller with a copy of paid tax receipts, either injured party could terminate the\ncontract and demand to keep the earnest money. Certainly, such minor breaches could not be held\nto warrant termination of the contract plus the award or retention of any earnest money.\n\nBecause the clause in this case subjects the parties to the same reparation for any default under the\ncontract, we hold that the provision is a penalty rather than one of liquidated damages. Therefore,\nthe trial court did not err in awarding damages to appellee and the appellant's sixth point of error\nis overruled.\n\n [12] In its last point of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in awarding damages\nto appellee based on the jury's response to special issue 13 because the appellee receives an\ninequitable windfall, recovering both the earnest money and $71,820 in lost profits. Appellant\ncontends that this result is inequitable in that the award grants recovery of both liquidated damages\nand recovery of profits.\n\nIn special issue 13, the jury was instructed to consider only those losses, if any, the payment of\nwhich would place appellee as nearly as possible in the position it would have occupied had the\nappellant performed the contract. The jury was further instructed to consider only those damages\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Replacement Parts..., 679 S.W.2d 721 (1984)\n\n\n\nthat were shown to be the natural, probable, *728 and foreseeable consequences of appellant's\nconduct.\n\nThe appellee contends that the jury correctly found that appellant's forfeited earnest money did\nnot give appellee the benefit of its bargain and did not put appellee in the position it would\nhave occupied had appellant performed the contract. Appellee points out that except for the\ndefective liquidated damages provision, the contract does not provide that the earnest money must\nbe returned once the parties began performance. Appellee urges this court to find that the jury\nrightfully considered the “realities of the transaction made the basis of this lawsuit.”\n\nThe jury had sufficient evidence before it from which it could conclude that the retention of\nappellant's earnest money by appellee did not adequately compensate appellee for the harm caused\nby appellee's breach and did not place appellee in the position it would have occupied had the\nappellant performed the contract.\n\nThe record reflects that the earnest money contracted for and received by appellee reduced the\namount of the outstanding purchase price. Both parties agree that between November 10, 1978\nand March 1979, appellant closed or “took down” 30 lots under the contract for deed. Moreover,\nappellant paid approximately $222,021 in interest on lots not taken down. Several homes were\nbuilt and sold on the lots “taken down.” Clearly, both parties had begun performance of the three-\nyear contract. This is important because there is no evidence that any of the “earnest money” was\nplaced in an escrow account to secure performance of the contract. In fact, appellee testified that\nthe majority of the money appellant paid to appellee was immediately passed to Mr. Shipwash\nin order to pay off the appellee's debt to Mr. Shipwash on the parallel contract. The record also\nreflects that appellee subtracted the amounts received from appellant on the “taken down” lots,\nincluding the $165,000 earnest money, before appellee computed his lost profits.\n\nTherefore, the jury's finding, that appellee would need an additional $71,820 in order to be fairly\nand reasonably compensated for damages sustained by appellant's breach, was supported by the\nevidence and did not constitute a “double recovery.” Appellant's seventh point of error is overruled.\n\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The assets to be sold were listed in Exhibit A to the PSA, which was further divided\ninto three sub-parts. Exhibit A–3 of the PSA identified “Leases and Lands” to be conveyed,\nincluding oil and gas leases, wells, mineral interests, and associated assets located in DeSoto\nParish, Louisiana. Under the PSA, the assets included all of Devon's right, title, and interest in and\nto the oil and gas leases, lands, and wells described in Exhibit A as follows:\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    2\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\n\n  2.1 Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, [Devon] agrees\n  to sell, and [KCS] agrees to purchase and pay for, all of [Devon]'s right, title and interest in\n  and to the following (less and except for the Excluded Assets, collectively, the “Assets ”):\n\n  (a) the oil and gas leases more particularly described in Exhibit A, subject to any depth\n  restrictions described in Exhibit A (collectively, the “Leases ”), together with any and all other\n  rights, titles, and interests of [Devon] in and to (i) the leasehold estates created thereby,\n  subject to any depth restrictions described in Exhibit A and to the terms, conditions, covenants,\n  and obligations set forth in the Leases and/or Exhibit A and (ii) the lands covered by the\n  Leases or included in Units with which the Leases may have been pooled or unitized, subject\n  to any depth restrictions described in Exhibit A (the “Lands ”), including in each case, without\n  limitation, fee interests, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, production payments, net\n  profits interests, carried interests, reversionary interests, and all other interests of any kind or\n  character;\n\n  (b) all oil and gas wells located on the Leases and the Lands or on other leases or lands with\n  which the Leases and/or the Lands may have been pooled or unitized (collectively and including\n  the wells set forth on Exhibit A, the “Wells ”), and all Hydrocarbons produced therefrom or\n  allocated thereto.\n\n(Emphasis added). The PSA also included a forum selection clause specifying that Texas law\napplied and that all actions arising out of or related to the PSA would be exclusively litigated in\nHarris County.\n\nAfter about six weeks of due diligence, the parties closed the deal on April 13, 2005. At the closing,\nDevon executed various deeds conveying the assets to KCS, including a “Deed, Assignment and\nBill of Sale” conveying the DeSoto Parish properties (the DeSoto Deed). Although the parties had\nnegotiated revisions to some of the deeds during the due diligence period, Exhibit A to the DeSoto\nDeed contained the same properties that were previously listed on Exhibit A–3 of the PSA, with\nno revisions other than the addition of recording information. On April 18, 2005, the DeSoto Deed\nwas recorded in the public records of DeSoto Parish.\n\nAbout five years later, a dispute arose between KCS and Devon concerning the scope of the mineral\ninterests Devon conveyed to KCS in DeSoto Parish. That dispute is the subject of this lawsuit.\nKCS contends that Devon intended to convey all of its right, title, and interest in two mineral\nservitudes 1 known as the “Olin Mathieson *208 Servitude” and the “Riverwood Servitude”\nburdening ten sections of land. Conversely, Devon maintains that its conveyance was restricted to\nspecific wells or wellbores located within the two mineral servitudes. For convenience, we will\nrefer to the properties at issue as the “Disputed Properties.”\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    3\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\nIn 2010, after Devon learned that KCS had mortgaged some of the Disputed Properties, Devon\nfiled a “Petition to Quiet Disturbance” in Louisiana seeking to cancel KCS's mortgage on those\nmineral interests. Devon contends that, after it filed that petition, EXCO Resources, Inc., another\noil and gas company, informed Devon that KCS was claiming an interest in wells in which Devon\nhad retained an interest under the PSA. Recognizing that Devon and KCS “had different views\nregarding what interests were intended to be conveyed by the PSA,” Devon argues that it filed this\ndeclaratory action in Texas in accordance with the PSA's forum-selection clause.\n\nKCS disputes Devon's account. According to KCS, EXCO contacted both Devon and KCS in\nthe fall of 2009 to confirm who owned the Disputed Properties in connection with EXCO's plans\nto drill new wells in the area and, rather than acknowledge KCS's ownership, Devon seized an\nopportunity “to re-gain the now highly valuable” mineral interests. According to KCS, Devon\nsought to maintain its suit in both Louisiana and Texas by challenging the conveyance of different\nsections of the Disputed Properties in each action. KCS also argues that Devon's original pleadings\nin the Texas action sought a declaration as to the parties' rights under the DeSoto Deed and an\nadjudication of title to Louisiana real property, not declaratory relief under the PSA.\n\nLitigation over the Disputed Properties proceeded in both Texas and Louisiana. In response to\nDevon's Louisiana petition, KCS answered and filed a counterclaim to have its rights under\nboth the PSA and the DeSoto Deed declared in its favor, as well as alternative claims for fraud,\nmisrepresentation, and violations of Louisiana law. KCS later amended its request for declaratory\nrelief to seek a declaration as to the DeSoto Deed only. The Louisiana case has since been stayed\npending the completion of the present case.\n\nIn the Texas action, KCS filed a motion to dismiss Devon's request for declaratory relief. Because\nDevon originally sought a declaration as to the parties' rights under the PSA and the DeSoto Deed\nin the Texas action, KCS argued that the Texas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to interpret\nthe DeSoto Deed and declare title to the Disputed Properties in Louisiana. The trial court treated\nKCS's motion as a plea to the jurisdiction and conditionally granted it, but allowed Devon the\nopportunity to amend its original petition.\n\nDevon then amended its pleading to seek a declaration of the parties' intent regarding the\nconveyance of the Disputed Properties under the PSA alone. In response, KCS again challenged\nthe court's jurisdiction over Devon's amended claims, arguing that the court must look first to the\nDeSoto Deed, not the PSA, because the conveyance provisions of the PSA had been merged into\nand were superseded by the conveyance provisions of the later-executed DeSoto Deed. The trial\ncourt denied KCS's motion, but stated that it would be willing to revisit the issue of subject matter\njurisdiction later in the proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\n *209 KCS later challenged the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction for a third time in a motion\nfor summary judgment, arguing that a declaration of the PSA would not resolve the parties' dispute\nand would be an advisory opinion on a question of title to land in Louisiana. Although the trial court\nheld a hearing on the motion, it made no ruling for several months. As the trial date approached,\nKCS amended its pleadings to file counterclaims for declaratory relief and alternatively, claims\nfor fraud and negligent misrepresentation, subject to its jurisdictional challenge. Devon also filed\na second amended petition.\n\nThe trial court granted KCS's motion for summary judgment on March 27, 2012, and ordered that\nDevon “take nothing” on its claims. Devon filed a motion to modify the trial court's summary\njudgment order, arguing that the trial court's ruling on the merits was improper and that the proper\nrelief was to dismiss Devon's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Shortly after that,\nKCS nonsuited all of its counterclaims except for its counterclaim for attorney's fees and costs as\nprovided in the declaratory judgments act.\n\nAlmost a year later, on March 25, 2013, the trial court granted Devon's motion to modify and\nentered a final judgment dismissing Devon's declaratory judgment claims and KCS's attorney's\nfees claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Both parties have appealed the final judgment.\n\n\n\n                                   ANALYSIS OF DEVON'S ISSUE\n\nI. Summary of the Parties' Arguments\nIn its motion for summary judgment, KCS argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to interpret\nthe conveyance terms of the PSA because any decision on that issue would be an impermissible\nadvisory opinion that would not resolve the parties' dispute concerning the ownership of the\nDisputed Properties. KCS contended that the declaratory relief Devon seeks would be advisory for\nthree reasons: (1) the PSA merged into the DeSoto Deed, so only the deed controls the respective\nrights of the parties; (2) the parties' intent under the PSA was superseded and mooted by the\nexecution of the DeSoto Deed; and (3) the statute of frauds bars enforcement of any declaration\nsince the PSA lacks the requisite recording information contained only in the DeSoto Deed.\nAccording to KCS, the final DeSoto Deed establishes the interests that were actually conveyed, and\ntherefore any disagreement between the parties concerning ownership of the Disputed Properties\nmust be resolved by a Louisiana court because the law is well-settled that Texas courts lack subject\nmatter jurisdiction to determine title to real property located in another state.\n\nOn appeal, Devon argues that the declaratory relief it seeks does not amount to an advisory opinion\nconcerning a question of title to land in Louisiana because the PSA was not merged into or\nsuperseded by the DeSoto Deed, the dispute regarding the meaning of the PSA is not moot, and\nthe statute of frauds does not apply. Devon also contends that its claims arise directly out of the\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    5\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\nPSA and so are governed by the PSA's forum selection and choice of law clause providing for\nlitigation of the action in Harris County and the application of Texas law. Further, Devon asserts\nthat Texas courts have jurisdiction to interpret contracts involving land in another state so long as\nthe case does not involve a “naked question of title,” and that this is such a case.\n\n\nII. Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n [1] [2] [3] We review a trial court's grant of summary judgment de novo. *210 Masterson v.\nDiocese of Nw. Tex., 422 S.W.3d 594, 607 (Tex.2013). To prevail on its motion, KCS was required\nto prove that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c); Joe v. Two Thirty Nine Joint Venture, 145 S.W.3d 150, 157\n(Tex.2004). We take as true all evidence favorable to Devon, the non-movant, and we indulge\nevery reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in Devon's favor. See Joe, 145 S.W.3d at 157.\nWe affirm the summary judgment if any of the theories presented to the trial court and preserved\nfor appellate review are meritorious. Id.\n\n [4] [5] [6] [7] Subject matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to decide\na case and is never presumed. Tex. Ass'n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440,\n443–44 (Tex.1993). The absence of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised by a motion for\nsummary judgment. Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex.2000). In reviewing\na challenge to the court's subject matter jurisdiction, the trial court may review the pleadings and\nany other evidence relevant to the subject matter jurisdiction issue. Id. at 554–55. Whether a trial\ncourt has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. Tex. Dep't of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda,\n133 S.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex.2004).\n\n [8] [9] Under Article II, section 1 of the Texas Constitution, courts have no jurisdiction to\nissue advisory opinions. Valley Baptist Med. Ctr. v. Gonzalez, 33 S.W.3d 821, 822 (Tex.2000)\n(per curiam); see Heckman v. Williamson Cnty., 369 S.W.3d 137, 147 (Tex.2012) (“The Texas\nConstitution—the source of the requirements of justiciability in Texas—bars our courts from\nrendering advisory opinions and limits access to the courts to those individuals who have suffered\nan actual, concrete injury.”). An advisory opinion decides an abstract question of law without\nbinding the parties, and a judgment based on an advisory opinion addresses only a hypothetical\ninjury rather than remedying an actual or imminent harm. Tex. Ass'n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at\n444. The prohibition on advisory opinions likewise precludes the courts from deciding moot\ncontroversies. Klein v. Hernandez, 315 S.W.3d 1, 3 (Tex.2010).\n\n [10] [11] The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA) allows a person interested under\na written contract to have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the\ncontract and to “obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.” Tex.\nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code § 37.004(a). But the Act does not create or enlarge a trial court's subject\nmatter jurisdiction; it is “merely a procedural device for deciding cases already within a court's\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Ass'n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at 444. Thus, a declaratory judgment is appropriate\nonly if a justiciable controversy exists as to the rights and status of the parties and the declaration\nwill resolve the controversy. Bonham State Bank v. Beadle, 907 S.W.2d 465, 467 (Tex.1995); see\nalso Tex Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code § 37.008 (“The court may refuse to render or enter a declaratory\njudgment or decree if the judgment or decree would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy\ngiving rise to the proceeding.”).\n\n\nII. Analysis of the Parties' Arguments\n\nA. Merger of the PSA into the DeSoto Deed and Mootness\n\n\n        1. The PSA is Merged Into, Superseded By, and Mooted by the DeSoto Deed.\n\nIn its summary-judgment motion, KCS first argued that any decision construing the PSA would\nbe an advisory opinion because the DeSoto Deed is the controlling *211 instrument under the\nmerger doctrine. The Supreme Court of Texas has long recognized that the conveyance provisions\nin a contract for the sale of real property merge into the deed executed in accordance with the\ncontract. Alvarado v. Bolton, 749 S.W.2d 47, 48 (Tex.1988).\n\n [12] [13] The merger doctrine requires courts to look to the deed alone in evaluating the parties'\nrespective rights even if the terms of the deed vary from the contract. Id. (“Though the terms\nof the deed may vary from those contained in the contract, still the deed must be looked to\nalone to determine the rights of the parties.”); see also Turberville v. Upper Valley Farms, Inc.,\n616 S.W.2d 676, 678 (Tex.Civ.App.-Corpus Christi 1981, no writ) (“Where a deed has been\nexecuted and accepted as performance of an executory contract to convey real estate, the contract\nis functus officio, and the rights of the parties rest thereafter solely in the deed.”). “The merger\ndoctrine is an analogue of the parol evidence rule and functions to prevent enforcement of prior\nor contemporaneous transactions on the assumption that all agreements merged into the final\nexecuted contract.” See GXG, Inc. v. Texacal Oil & Gas, 977 S.W.2d 403, 415 (Tex.App.-Corpus\nChristi 1998, pet. denied).\n\nFor example, in Commercial Bank, Unincorporated, of Mason, Tex. v. Satterwhite, the plaintiff\nsought to cancel a general warranty deed conveying to the defendant the plaintiff's mother's and\nher late husband's community interests in the family ranch. See 413 S.W.2d 905, 906 (Tex.1967).\nThe mother had entered into a contract for sale with the defendant to sell “all of her right title and\ninterest in and to” the ranch. Id. at 909 (emphasis added). The deed that she executed individually\nand in her capacity as executrix of her husband's estate, however, conveyed specifically described\ntracts encompassing the ranch. Id. The court held that pursuant to the merger doctrine, in the\nabsence of fraud, accident, or mistake, “all prior agreements entered into between the parties [were]\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     7\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\nconsidered merged in the deed” and it refused to reform the deed to reflect that only the mother's\ncommunity interest in the ranch had been conveyed. Id.\n\nSimilarly, in Carter v. Barclay, 476 S.W.2d 909, 915 (Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo 1972, no writ),\nan action to quiet title to real property, the plaintiff argued that certain language in a contract to\npurchase land prevented the rights of the parties from merging into the deed, and that the contract\nand deed were cumulative of the parties' rights. The court held that the deed alone controlled\nthe terms on which the property was conveyed and superseded any other agreement between the\nparties regarding the conveyance terms, the consideration, and the method of payment:\n\n           [I]n the absence of fraud, accident or mistake in the execution, the deed, an\n           absolute conveyance on its face, must be considered the final expression and\n           the sole repository of the terms upon which [the parties] have agreed with\n           respect to the property conveyed, the consideration and the method of payment.\n           Although ... certain rights of appellee are still governed under the contract,\n           such as the furnishing of water, restrictions and easements, ... the matter of\n           consideration and method of payment were finalized in the deed which was an\n           absolute conveyance of the property in question..... [T]he general warranty deed\n           by its very nature has finalized and supersedes any other agreement between the\n           parties regarding consideration and method of payment ....\n\nId. at 914–15 (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted).\n\n *212 KCS argues that, as in these cases, the conveyance terms of the PSA merged into and were\nsuperseded by the DeSoto Deed when it was executed at closing. Consequently, a determination\nof the parties' intent under the PSA would be no more than parol evidence, admissible only in the\nevent a Louisiana court finds that the conveyance terms of the DeSoto Deed were ambiguous or\nwere procured by fraud. See GXG, Inc., 977 S.W.2d at 416 (“principles of law permit referral to\nagreement upon which deed is founded to explain an ambiguity in deed”). Because the Louisiana\ncourt has made no such determination, and may never do so, the declaration Devon seeks would be\npremised on the happening of a future, hypothetical event. Thus, KCS argues, any such declaration\nwould be advisory because it would not resolve the ownership of the Disputed Properties conveyed\nby the DeSoto Deed. See Stop #N Go Mkts. of Tex., Inc. v. Exec. Sec. Sys., Inc. of Am., 556\nS.W.2d 836, 837 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1977, no writ) (recognizing “[a] justiciable\ncontroversy does not exist and an advisory opinion is being sought if a party requests a court to\nrender a declaratory judgment premised upon the happening of a future, hypothetical event”).\n\n [14] [15] KCS also argues that the declaration Devon seeks would be advisory because the\nissue of what interests the parties intended to convey under the PSA is mooted by the execution\nof the DeSoto Deed. Mootness is a component of subject matter jurisdiction. See Valley Baptist\nMed. Ctr., 33 S.W.3d at 822. The mootness doctrine prevents courts from rendering advisory\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    8\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\nopinions, which they have no jurisdiction to issue. Id. A case becomes moot if there ceases to be\na justiciable controversy between the parties, such as when “the issues presented are no longer\n‘live.’ ” Heckman, 369 S.W.3d at 162; see also In re H & R Block Fin. Advisors, Inc., 262 S.W.3d\n896, 900 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, orig. proceeding) (“An issue may become moot\nwhen a party seeks a ruling on some matter which, when rendered, would not have any practical\nlegal effect on a then-existing controversy.”).\n\n [16] We agree with KCS that any issue regarding what the parties intended to convey under the\nPSA is no longer live because the DeSoto Deed is the final expression and sole repository of the\nparties' agreement with respect to the properties conveyed. See Satterwhite, 413 S.W.2d at 909;\nCarter, 476 S.W.2d at 915. This conclusion is consistent not only with the case law but also with\nthe practical application of the doctrine. Devon's own land manager testified that anyone seeking\nto determine what properties were actually conveyed to KCS would need to review the exhibits\nattached to the deeds executed at the closing of the transaction—not the exhibits attached to the\nPSA that was executed six weeks earlier—because the exhibits to the PSA were not revised to\nreflect any changes made when properties were removed or added to the deal as a result of the\ndue-diligence process. The parties' agreement to apply Texas law to the construction of the PSA\nfurther compels the application of this settled Texas doctrine.\n\nApplying the doctrine of merger, any interpretation of the PSA would not resolve the issue as to\nwho owns the Disputed Properties because the final DeSoto Deed establishes the interests that were\nactually conveyed. 2 The declaration Devon seeks will have no determinative legal *213 effect on\nthe parties' controversy over ownership of the Disputed Properties conveyed by the DeSoto Deed,\nas only the Louisiana court has the ability to adjudicate title to realty. Because any declaration of\nthe parties' intent under the PSA would not resolve the parties' dispute, the declaration Devon seeks\nwould be advisory only and therefore the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider\nit. See, e.g., Patterson v. Planned Parenthood of Houston and Se. Tex., Inc., 971 S.W.2d 439, 443\n(Tex.1998); Tex. Ass'n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at 444.\n\n\n\n   2. Devon's Contrary Arguments Concerning Merger and Mootness are Unpersuasive.\n\nDevon contends that the trial court erred in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction\nover the parties' dispute because the PSA was not merged into, superseded by, or mooted by the\nDeSoto Deed. Discussing the merger and superseded contract doctrines together with mootness,\nDevon argues these doctrines do not apply because (1) the PSA survived the closing and did\nnot address the same subject matter as the DeSoto Deed; and (2) KCS made allegations of fraud\nand misrepresentation regarding the PSA and also sought reformation of the PSA. Because the\nPSA was neither merged into nor superseded by the DeSoto Deed, Devon asserts, the controversy\nregarding its meaning is not moot.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   9\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\n\n              (a) The Existence of Surviving Collateral Terms Does Not Preclude\n               the Application of the Merger Doctrine to the Conveyance Terms.\n\nFirst, Devon contends that the merger doctrine does not apply because the PSA created continuing\nrights and obligations that were independent of the conveyances within it. See Harris v. Rowe,\n593 S.W.2d 303, 306–07 (Tex.1979); Stanford Dev. Corp. v. Stanford Condo. Owners Ass'n, 285\nS.W.3d 45, 52 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.). Devon argues that the PSA contains\na number of independent rights and obligations that survived closing, such as an agreement to\ncooperate in effectuating the intent of the PSA and detailed indemnification provisions. Devon\nalso points to language in the DeSoto Deed that “the execution and delivery of this Assignment ...\nshall not operate to release or impair any surviving rights and obligations of Assignor or Assignee\nunder the [PSA].” Further, Devon argues that as a practical matter, the parties continued to revise\nleases and assignments under the PSA even beyond the closing date, something they would not\nhave done if the DeSoto Deed rendered the PSA moot.\n\nIn response, KCS does not dispute that certain provisions of the PSA survived beyond the\nexecution of the deeds at the closing, but argues that Devon's argument ignores the actual dispute\nbetween them, which concerns the scope of the conveyance as it relates to the Disputed Properties\nrather than any of the PSA's surviving terms. We agree. Devon's cited authorities concern disputes\nover collateral terms, not disputes over terms of the conveyance that were merged into the\nsubsequently executed agreement. For example, in Harris v. Rowe, the Texas Supreme Court\nheld that an escrow agreement pertaining to funds for post-conveyance construction work was\ncollateral to and independent of the conveyance terms in the purchase contract. 593 S.W.2d at\n306–07. Likewise, in Stanford Dev. Corp., the court of appeals held that arbitration provisions\nin homeowners' earnest money contracts created rights collateral to and independent of the deeds\nto their condominiums that were not merged into and extinguished by the subsequent deeds. 285\nS.W.3d at 52.\n\n *214 [17] Here, the dispute between Devon and KCS does not involve the PSA's surviving\ncollateral terms, such as the right to transfer properties after closing. It involves the scope of the\nconveyance itself and whether Devon conveyed the Disputed Properties to KCS based on the\ndescriptions provided in the DeSoto Deed. Under the PSA, Devon agreed to convey all of its\n“right, title and interest” in and to the described assets, and Devon points to nothing in the PSA\nindicating that the parties intended to retain some legal or equitable interest in those assets, and it\nis undisputed that the descriptions of the properties conveyed in the exhibits to both the PSA and\nthe DeSoto Deed are the same. Devon's reliance on the collateral-rights exception is misplaced\nand does not defeat the application of the merger doctrine.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  10\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\nIn a related argument, Devon contends that the merger doctrine does not apply because the DeSoto\nDeed addressed only a small portion of the multistate assets identified in the PSA. See, e.g.,\nSuperior Laminate & Supply, Inc. v. Formica Corp., 93 S.W.3d 445, 448–49 (Tex.App.-Houston\n[14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied) (“A merger occurs when the same parties to an earlier agreement\nlater enter into a written integrated agreement covering the same subject matter.”). Devon contends\nthat it was clearly not the intent of the parties that the PSA be merged into, superseded by, or\nmooted by the DeSoto Deed because the parties included in the DeSoto Deed the statement that\nthe Deed was “expressly made subject to” the PSA.\n\nThese arguments also fail because the parties' actual dispute is confined to the ownership of the\nDisputed Properties, which are addressed by both the PSA and the DeSoto Deed. None of Devon's\nauthorities support its argument that because the PSA involves properties in addition to those\nconveyed in the DeSoto Deed, the merger doctrine does not apply to a property addressed by\nboth instruments. That the deal included other assets in other states has no bearing on the parties'\ndispute over the assets conveyed in Louisiana. For the same reason, we reject Devon's argument\nthat the DeSoto Deed's language that it is made “subject to” the PSA indicates the parties' intent\nthat the PSA would not be merged into, superseded by, or mooted by the DeSoto Deed. The\nevidence shows that although revisions were made to the exhibits attached to the deeds during the\ndue-diligence process, the exhibits to the PSA describing the properties to be conveyed were not\ncorrespondingly revised. Thus, the deeds, rather than the PSA, reflect the parties' final agreement\nas to which properties were conveyed to KCS. Moreover, as KCS argues, if the conveyance terms\nof the DeSoto Deed were “subject to” the PSA, then the revisions the parties made to deeds during\nthe due-diligence period would be irrelevant. Such a construction of the DeSoto Deed would also\nundermine the purpose of the merger doctrine. Therefore, both the evidence and the case law are\nconsistent with the application of the merger doctrine in this case. See Alvarado v. Bolton, 749\nS.W.2d at 48 (stating that when a deed is delivered and accepted as performance of a contract to\nconvey, the contract is merged into the deed).\n\n\n\n(b) KCS's Dismissed Counterclaims Do Not Preclude Application of the Merger Doctrine.\n\nSecond, Devon argues that the merger doctrine does not apply because KCS made allegations of\nfraud and misrepresentation regarding the PSA, and also sought reformation of the PSA. See, e.g.,\nGXG Inc., 977 S.W.2d at 416 (“The doctrine of merger is inapplicable when there is an allegation\nof fraud, mistake, or accident, *215 or an ambiguity in the contract.”); see also Givens v. Ward,\n272 S.W.3d 63, 68–69 (Tex.App.-Waco 2008, no pet.) (declining to apply merger doctrine when\nclaim for reformation of deed required determination of parties' original agreement). But Devon's\narguments against application of the merger doctrine based on KCS's counterclaims fail for two\nreasons.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                11\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\n [18] First, KCS's fraud, misrepresentation, and reformation counterclaims, which were expressly\nmade subject to KCS's jurisdictional challenge, were nonsuited and dismissed in May 2012. Thus,\nthe counterclaims were not live pleadings when the final order on KCS's summary-judgment\nmotion was modified and signed on March 25, 2013. 3 Second, all of KCS's counterclaims were\nin opposition to Devon's requested declarations as to the PSA and called into question Devon's\nconduct leading up to the execution of the PSA, not the DeSoto Deed. The cases Devon cites\nare distinguishable because they each address allegations of fraud or reformation relating to\nexecution of the subsequent deed, not the preliminary contracts for sale like the PSA. As KCS\nacknowledges, it could not have sought an interpretation of the DeSoto Deed because the trial\ncourt lacks jurisdiction over such a claim.\n\nWe conclude that Devon has failed to demonstrate that the merger doctrine is inapplicable to this\ncase.\n\n\nB. The PSA's Forum Selection Clause\nDevon's lead appellate argument is that the trial court's ruling was erroneous because the PSA's\nforum selection clause requires that the parties' dispute be litigated in Harris County. This clause\nprovides that the PSA and the parties' legal relations shall be governed by Texas law, that all parties\nto the PSA consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction by Texas courts for any action arising\nout of the PSA or other transaction documents, and that “[a]ll actions or proceedings with respect\nto, arising directly or indirectly in connection with, out of, related to or from” the PSA “shall be\nexclusively litigated in courts having sites in Houston, Harris County Texas.”\n\nDevon argues that its declaratory judgment action must be litigated in Harris County because the\nrelief Devon sought in its amended petition required a judicial determination of the intent of the\nparties to the PSA. Devon notes that Texas' public policy strongly favors the freedom of parties\nto contract, so long as their agreement does not violate the law or public policy. See BMG Direct\nMktg., Inc. v. Peake, 178 S.W.3d 763, 767 (Tex.2005); In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148\nS.W.3d 124, 129–30 & n. 11 (Tex.2004). Therefore, Devon contends, its forum selection clause\n“should be given full effect.” See In re Lisa Laser USA, Inc., 310 S.W.3d 880, 883 (Tex.2010).\n\nBut the trial court did not rule that the PSA's forum selection clause was unenforceable; it ruled that\nthe trial court *216 lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Devon's declaratory judgment. Devon\ndoes not argue that the forum selection clause somehow confers subject matter jurisdiction on the\ncourt, nor do Devon's cited cases so hold. The law is well settled that parties may by agreement\nconsent to personal jurisdiction and venue in a given court, but subject matter jurisdiction cannot\nbe conferred merely by agreement of the parties. See, e.g., Burke v. Satterfield, 525 S.W.2d 950,\n953 (Tex.1975) (“It is also fundamental ... that the subject matter jurisdiction of a court cannot\nbe enlarged by an agreement between the parties or a request that the court exceed its powers.”);\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   12\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\nTaub v. Aquila Sw. Pipeline Corp., 93 S.W.3d 451, 461 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no\npet.) (“Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent, waiver, or estoppel at any stage\nof a proceeding.”). Therefore, Devon's reliance on this clause is misplaced because the presence\nof the forum selection clause in the PSA cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction where it does\nnot otherwise exist.\n\n\nC. Adjudication of Title to Land in Another State\nDevon next argues that Texas courts have subject matter jurisdiction to determine obligations\nunder a contract that may involve land located in another state, and that this action is such a case.\nAccording to Devon, the trial court has jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment action because\nit does not involve a “naked question of title.”\n\n [19] As Devon acknowledges, Texas courts have no subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate title\nto realty, including interests in oil and gas leases, in another state or country. See, e.g., Trutec\nOil & Gas, Inc. v. Western Atlas Int'l, Inc., 194 S.W.3d 580, 583 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n2006, no pet.) (citing Holt v. Guerguin, 106 Tex. 185, 163 S.W. 10, 12 (1914)); Kelly Oil Co.,\nInc. v. Svetlik, 975 S.W.2d 762, 764 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1998, pet. denied); Miller v. Miller,\n715 S.W.2d 786, 788 (Tex.App.-Austin 1986, writ ref'd n.r.e.). But a Texas court with jurisdiction\nover the parties may enforce a party's personal or contractual obligation that indirectly involves\nproperty in another state. See Tex. & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Gay, 86 Tex. 571, 26 S.W. 599, 605–06\n(1894); Hartman v. Sirgo Operating, Inc., 863 S.W.2d 764, 766 (Tex.App.-El Paso 1993, pet.\ndenied). For example, a Texas court may compel a party over whom it has jurisdiction to execute\na conveyance of a real property interest situated in another state. See McElreath v. McElreath, 162\nTex. 190, 345 S.W.2d 722, 727–28 (1961). Some courts have described the distinction as whether\nthe case involves a “naked question of title.” See, e.g., Hartman, 863 S.W.2d at 766.\n\nTo determine the nature of Devon's action, we look to Devon's pleadings and the relevant evidence.\nSee Trutec Oil & Gas, Inc., 194 S.W.3d at 583–88 (rejecting appellant's contention that its action\nwas only “tangentially” related to real property and affirming trial court's dismissal of appellant's\nclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when a review of the pleadings and evidence\ndemonstrated that appellant's core complaint was that that it had been wrongfully deprived of\nthe functional equivalent of oil and gas leases in Nigeria). In Devon's second amended petition,\nDevon sets out in detail the dispute between it and KCS over the extent of the mineral interests\nconveyed. 4 Devon describes the *217 nature of the present action as seeking “a determination\nof the parties' intent with respect to certain Louisiana mineral interests described in Exhibit A–3\nof the PSA.” In its request for relief, Devon further states:\n\n\n  By the present action, Devon does not seek a construction of the [DeSoto Deed], or a\n  determination or adjudication of title to the Louisiana properties listed in the PSA. Rather,\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 13\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\n   Devon seeks a construction of the PSA and the determination of the parties' intent under the\n   PSA regarding the mineral interests the PSA was intended to encompass. Such an action must\n   necessarily precede any action to adjudicate title....\n   Devon then requests specific declarations that (1) the parties intended to include in “the PSA\n   transaction” only Devon's interest in specifically named wells located on specific sections of the\n   lands described on Exhibit A–3 to the PSA pertaining to DeSoto Parish, Louisiana, and not all of\n   Devon's right, title and interest in the mineral servitudes; and (2) the parties intended to exclude\n   from “the PSA transaction” three additional sections of land in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana.\nThroughout its pleading, Devon insists that the controlling document is the PSA and not the\nDeSoto Deed, and restricts its requested relief to an interpretation of the parties' intent under\nthe PSA. It is evident, however, that the relief Devon ultimately seeks is the resolution of the\ndisagreement between it and KCS as to which of them owns the Disputed Properties in Louisiana.\nNotably, Devon first filed suit in Louisiana, claiming that it owned the mineral interests KCS\nhad mortgaged. And when Devon originally filed this lawsuit in Texas, it requested declarations\nregarding ownership of the Disputed Properties under both the DeSoto Deed and the PSA. Only\nafter the trial court granted KCS's plea to the jurisdiction did Devon amend its pleadings to argue\nthat the dispute could be resolved by interpreting the PSA alone. Moreover, although Devon relies\non cases like McElreath for the proposition that a Texas court has subject matter jurisdiction to\norder a conveyance of out-of-state property, neither party has requested such relief. Instead, Devon\nrequests a declaration of the Louisiana mineral interests it intended to convey.\n\nThe other authorities on which Devon relies are also distinguishable. See Hartman, 863 S.W.2d\nat 766 (affirming trial court's jurisdiction to determine the validity of a contract for the sale and\nexchange of certain oil and gas properties in New Mexico because the “trial court was not required\nto determine ownership of land in New Mexico nor was any relief sought requiring the transfer\nof title to land in New Mexico”); Protech of Tex., Inc. v. BP Oil Pipeline Co., No. 01–95–00270–\nCV, 1995 WL 737442, at *3 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] Dec. 14, 1995, pet. denied) (mem. op.,\nnot designated for publication) (holding case did not simply involve “a naked question of title”\nand trial court had subject matter jurisdiction when plaintiff's claims sounded in tort, contract, and\nquasi-contract); Askanase v. Maddox, No. 05–91–01595–CV, 1992 WL 224588, *5 (Tex.App.-\nDallas Sept. 10, 1992, writ denied) (mem. op., not designated for publication) (reversing plea to the\njurisdiction because the “substance and purpose” of the claim was the recovery of money damages\nfor breach of contract, tortious interference, and the declaration of contractual rights, *218 not a\ntransfer of property or adjudication of title). 5\n\n [20] In contrast, the pleadings, factual allegations, and relief sought in this case demonstrate\nthat the gravamen of Devon's action is the determination of the parties' existing property interests\nlocated in another state. Despite being couched as a request for declaratory relief under the UDJA,\nthe relief Devon seeks is in essence a determination of title to land in Louisiana-a matter over\nwhich the trial court lacks jurisdiction.

Disposition of Devon's Appeal\nWe conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing Devon's claims for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction on the basis that Devon's requested declaratory relief sought an impermissible advisory\nopinion concerning Devon's conveyance of mineral interests located in Louisiana. We overrule\nDevon's issues and affirm that portion of the trial court's judgment granting summary judgment\nin favor of KCS.\n\n\n\n                                            KCS's Cross–Issue\n\nIn one cross-issue, KCS contends the trial court erred in dismissing its counterclaim for attorney's\nfees under the UDJA for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. According to KCS, a trial court has\njurisdiction to adjudicate a defendant's claim for costs and attorney's fees when the defendant\nsucceeds on its claim that the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claim\nfor declaratory relief.\n\nIn response, Devon argues that when a trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a case from\nthe time of filing, the only action the court may take is to dismiss the case. To hold otherwise\nwould be contrary to controlling case law, the plain language of the UDJA, and those courts which\nhave distinguished between cases in which the court had subject matter jurisdiction and lost it\nand those in which the court never properly acquired subject matter jurisdiction. As above, when\nreviewing whether subject matter jurisdiction exists, we review the trial court's ruling de novo.\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n\nA. Attorney's Fees Under the UDJA\n [21] In any proceeding under the UDJA, the court “may award costs and reasonable and necessary\nattorneys' fees as are equitable and just.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code § 37.009. The UDJA\n“entrusts attorney fee awards to the trial court's sound discretion, subject to the requirements that\nany fees awarded be reasonable and necessary, which are matters of fact, and to the additional\nrequirements that fees be equitable and just, which are matters of law.” Bocquet v. Herring, 972\nS.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex.1998). Under the UDJA, a party defending a suit brought under the UDJA may\nbe awarded its reasonable and necessary attorney's fees. Bradt v. State Bar of Tex., 905 S.W.2d\n756, 760 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1995, no pet.).\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\nDevon argues broadly that if KCS is correct that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\nover Devon's claims, *219 then the trial court likewise lacked subject matter jurisdiction to award\nKCS its costs and attorney's fees. See Goss v. City of Houston, 391 S.W.3d 168, 176 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2012, no pet.) (“Subject matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of the\ncourts to decide a case.”); Little v. Tex. Bd. of Law Examiners, 334 S.W.3d 860, 862 (Tex.App.-\nAustin 2011, no pet.) (“Failure to comply with a jurisdictional requirement deprives the trial\ncourt of the power to act, other than to determine that it lacks jurisdiction.”); see also Mapco,\nInc. v. Forrest, 795 S.W.2d 700, 703 (Tex.1990) (per curiam) (stating that a judgment is void\nif it is apparent that the court rendering the judgment lacks subject matter jurisdiction). But the\ntrial court's determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Devon's claims does not\nnecessarily mean that it had no authority to consider KCS's counterclaim for fees and costs in\ndefending the lawsuit.\n\n\n\n                         1. KCS's authorities are on point and persuasive.\n\nKCS points to two cases expressly holding that a trial court maintains jurisdiction over a\ncounterclaim for attorney's fees under the UDJA despite the dismissal of the plaintiffs declaratory\njudgment action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See Castro v. McNabb, 319 S.W.3d 721,\n735–36 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2009, no pet.); Zurita v. SVH–1 Partners, Ltd., No. 03–10–00650–CV,\n2011 WL 6118573, at *8 (Tex.App.-Austin Dec. 8, 2011, pet. denied) (mem. op.). In Castro, the\ncourt examined the plain language of section 37.009 and determined that the UDJA “does not\nrequire a judgment on the merits of the dispute as a prerequisite to a fee award.” 319 S.W.3d at\n735. Accordingly, the court concluded that\n\n           Castro invoked the entire [UDJA] when she filed suit. Her failure to make\n           the City a party to the suit meant that any declaration sought does not change\n           the nature of the proceedings below. Because this was a proceeding under the\n           [UDJA], the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction under Section 37.009 to\n           award attorney's fees to McNabb.\n\nId. at 735–36. The Zurita court reached the same conclusion, holding that the dismissal of a\nclam under the UDJA for lack of subject matter jurisdiction does not preclude the trial court\nfrom awarding attorney's fees under the statute to the party who succeeded in having the claims\ndismissed. See Zurita, 2011 WL 6118573, at *8.\n\nDevon asserts, however, that these cases are “non-controlling” and adverse to decisions of the\nHouston appellate courts. As support for its contention, Devon relies on Graves v. Diehl, No.\n01–00–00412–CV, 2006 WL 1699527 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] June 22, 2006, pet. denied)\n(mem. op.), and Kenneth Leventhal & Co. v. Reeves, 978 S.W.2d 253 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 16\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\nDist.] 1998, no pet.). But these cases are distinguishable and do not control the disposition of\nKCS's issue.\n\nIn Reeves, the plaintiff sought attorney's fees in connection with a breach of contract claim and an\nidentical claim for declaratory relief. 978 S.W.2d at 256. This Court reversed the trial court's award\nof attorney's fees because the plaintiff recovered no damages and so could not recover attorney's\nfees under Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Id. at 257–58. Further, the\ncourt held that the plaintiff could not use a request for declaratory relief identical to his breach of\ncontract claim “simply to pave the way to recover attorney's fees not otherwise available.” Id. at\n258–59. The Reeves court went on to note that the plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief “should\nhave been dismissed by the trial *220 court because it was moot” and therefore the plaintiff was\nnot entitled to recover fees on the basis of either breach of contract or declaratory judgment. Id. at\n259–60. In a single paragraph, the court addressed the defendant's second issue as follows:\n\n           In its second point of error, [the defendant] argues that even if there was a\n           legal basis for an award of attorney's fees to [the plaintiff], the court abused its\n           discretion and, if anything, should have awarded fees to [the defendant]. Having\n           found no legal basis for awarding attorney's fees to [the plaintiff] we likewise\n           find no legal basis for awarding such fees to [the defendant]. Therefore, [the\n           defendant's] second point of error is overruled.\n\nId. at 260. In other words, having concluded that the plaintiff improperly invoked the UDJA to\nrequest the same relief already sought under his breach of contract claim, the court held that\nthe UDJA was not a proper procedural vehicle to award either party attorney's fees. In contrast,\nDevon's UDJA claim was not duplicative of any other claim or urged solely for the purpose of\nobtaining attorney's fees; Devon properly invoked the UDJA when it filed its original petition\nseeking a declaration of the rights, obligations, and legal status of the parties under the PSA and\nthe DeSoto Deed.\n\nGraves is factually distinguishable because in that case only the defendants sought affirmative\ndeclaratory relief and attorney's fees. The defendants' requested relief was denied for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction, so fees were not warranted. See 2006 WL 1699527, at *9. The Graves\ncourt's decision was also based on its determination that the declaratory judgment and fee award\nwere an abuse of discretion because the lawsuit did not involve the construction of a deed to the\ndefendants' property as recited in the trial court's judgment; it involved the manner in which the\ndefendants made use of their property, and no deed was even offered into evidence. Id. at *10.\nThus, the court concluded there was no basis in the record for the trial court to award either a\ndeclaratory judgment or attorney's fees under the UDJA. Id. This was not a case in which the fees\nwere incurred solely in defense of a plaintiff's UDJA claim.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\n [22] We also note that more recently, the same court has held, consistent with Castro and Zurita,\nthat the trial court had the power to award attorney's fees under the UDJA even though it had\ndismissed the plaintiff's declaratory judgment claim for lack of jurisdiction. See Feldman v. KPMG\nLLP, 438 S.W.3d 678, 685–86 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.). Thus, the decisions\nin Graves and Reeves do not preclude this Court from holding that the trial court maintained\njurisdiction to resolve the issue of attorney's fees. We find Feldman, Castro, and Zurita persuasive\nauthority and agree that attorney's fees may be awarded to a party defending against a declaratory\njudgment action over which the trial court has determined that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction\nover the plaintiff's claim.\n\n\n\n                    2. Devon's argument that the plain language of the UDJA\n                      precludes an award of attorney's fees is unpersuasive.\n\nDevon argues that section 37.009's provision allowing for attorney's fees in any proceeding\n“under” the UDJA requires the trial court to first have subject matter jurisdiction over the\nunderlying controversy to have the authority to award fees. To support this interpretation of the\nstatute, Devon points to federal case law interpreting substantive federal statutes. See *221\nCliburn v. Police Jury Ass'n of La., Inc., 165 F.3d 315, 316 (5th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (holding\nthat trial court's award of attorney's fees under ERISA 6 was inconsistent with dismissal for lack\nof subject matter jurisdiction because there was no ERISA “action” under the statute and neither\nthe plaintiff nor the defendant were a “participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary” eligible to invoke\nthe substantive statute's attorney's fees provision); In re Knight, 207 F.3d 1115, 1117–18 (9th\nCir.2000) (relying in part on Cliburn to hold that when district court dismissed ERISA action\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction, “there was no ERISA action” and therefore no jurisdiction\nto award attorney's fees and costs); W.G. v. Senatore, 18 F.3d 60, 64–65 (2d Cir.1994) (holding\nthat when trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff's substantive claims under\nIDEA, 7 the court lacked jurisdiction to consider plaintiff's request for fees allowed in “any action\nor proceeding brought under this subsection”).\n\nDevon further argues that Texas courts have held that a trial court has jurisdiction to award\nattorney's fees only when a party has “properly invoked” the UDJA. See Knighton v. Int'l. Bus.\nMachines Corp., 856 S.W.2d 206, 210 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, writ denied) (“When\na claimant ... has properly invoked the declaratory judgment statute, either party may plead for\nand obtain attorney's fees.”) (emphasis added); Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. Budget Rent–A–Car\nSys., Inc., 796 S.W.2d 763, 771 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1990, writ denied) (“[W]here a claimant or a\ncounter-claimant has properly invoked the declaratory judgment statute, either party may plead\nfor and obtain attorney's fees.”) (emphasis added). Devon also cites City of Houston v. Chemam,\n01–08–01005–CV, 2010 WL 143476, at *8 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] Jan. 14, 2010, no\npet.) (mem. op.), in which the court held that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\nover the underlying declaratory judgment action and thus “any claim for attorney's fees arising\nunder it.” (emphasis added). According to Devon, the section of the UDJA allowing an award of\nattorney's fees is a subset of the larger Act, and a trial court without jurisdiction under the Act\ncannot selectively assert subject matter jurisdiction over the remedies section of the Act to award\nfees.\n\n [23] Initially, we note that decisions of the federal courts, other than the Supreme Court, may\nbe persuasive in a state court or a federal matter, but in this appeal they are not binding. See J.M.\nHuber Corp. v. Santa Fe Energy Res., Inc., 871 S.W.2d 842, 846 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n1994, writ denied). Further, all of the federal cases Devon cites involved the interpretation of\nfederal substantive statutes. In contrast, the UDJA is a procedural device that does not establish\njurisdiction. Chenault v. Phillips, 914 S.W.2d 140, 141 (Tex.1996) (per curiam) (“[T]he [UDJA]\nis not a grant of jurisdiction, but ‘merely a procedural device for deciding cases already within a\ncourt's jurisdiction.’ ”) (quoting State v. Morales, 869 S.W.2d 941, 947 (Tex.1994)). The court in\nIn re Knight, on which Devon relies, expressly acknowledged that courts can award fees even in\nthe absence of subject matter jurisdiction when those fees are authorized by statutes and rules that\nare non-substantive. See 207 F.3d at 1117.\n\nUnder the UDJA, the trial court has authority to award attorneys' fees and costs “[i]n any\nproceeding under this chapter.” See *222 Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code § 37.009. By seeking\ndeclaratory relief, Devon initiated a “proceeding under this chapter” that falls squarely within the\nplain language of Section 37.009. In response, KCS properly pleaded an ancillary claim for relief\nunder the statute through its counterclaim for attorneys' fees. See id. § 37.004. KCS's fee claim\nwas likewise a “proceeding under this chapter” and thus remained viable even though Devon's\naction was properly dismissed.\n\nAlso unpersuasive is Devon's claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award fees because the\nUDJA was not “properly invoked” from the outset. None of the cases Devon relies on involve the\nabsence of subject matter jurisdiction over the primary claim. The references to properly invoking\nthe statute in these cases relate only to proper pleading and improper attempts to use the UDJA\nto recover fees when they are not available under the substantive law that serves as the basis\nfor the plaintiff's claims. See Knighton, 856 S.W.2d at 210–11 (holding that trial court did not\nabuse its discretion to deny request for attorney's fees when the record reflected that the trial\ncourt recognized that both parties pursued legitimate rights and therefore each should bear its own\nattorney's fees); Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., 796 S.W.2d at 772 (reversing judgment for plaintiff on\ncontract claim and declining to remand for consideration of equitable and just attorney's fees under\nUDJA when plaintiff's additional request for declaratory relief was unnecessary and improper).\nSimilarly, City of Houston v. Chemam is not on point, because in that case the court reversed a trial\ncourt's denial of the City's plea to the jurisdiction when a plaintiff attempted to avoid governmental\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See\n2010 WL 143476, at *8.\n\n [24] Devon “invoked” the UDJA through its pleadings. KCS, therefore, was eligible to recover\nits attorneys' fees as a party defending a claim for declaratory relief. See Allstate Ins. Co. v.\nHallman, 159 S.W.3d 640, 641–43 (Tex.2005); Bradt, 905 S.W.2d at 759–60; see also Corcoran\nv. Atascocita Cmty.

(affirming award of\nattorney's fees to third-party defendant against whom appellants filed suit). Therefore, regardless\nof whether Devon prevailed on its own claims, the trial court had jurisdiction over KCS's attorneys'\nfee claim for the defense of that litigation.\n\n\n\n                       3. Texas law does not recognize Devon's distinction\n                      between intervening mootness and mootness ab initio.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has recognized that a trial court retains jurisdiction to award attorneys'\nfees even if the merits of the dispute become moot. See Hallman, 159 S.W.3d at 643; Camarena\nv. Tex. Emp't Comm'n, 754 S.W.2d 149, 151 (Tex.1988). Devon argues that these cases are\ndistinguishable, however, because they involve situations in which a trial court properly had\nsubject matter jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action at the outset of the case but then\nlater, because of subsequent actions, lost jurisdiction. As support for its contention, Devon cites\nto Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. v. Rambus, Inc., 398 F.Supp.2d 470, 481 (E.D.Va.2005). In that\ncase, the court stated that “[w]here a court is divested of its subject matter jurisdiction over the\nsubstantive claim by virtue of intervening mootness, it nonetheless retains jurisdiction to ‘consider\ncollateral issues after an action is no longer pending.’ ” Id. at 482. But the court went on to state\nthat, in contrast, “lack of subject matter jurisdiction over a substantive *223 claim serves ‘to bar\nan award of attorney's fees where an action was moot at the time of filing.’ ” Id. at 481.\n\n [25] We conclude that, under Texas law, the point in time when the court lacked subject matter\njurisdiction over Devon's predicate claims is irrelevant to KCS's fee claim. Although Hallman\nand Camarena involved situations in which the court lost subject matter jurisdiction during the\npendency of the litigation because the plaintiff's claims became moot, the same analysis applies\nto a situation in which the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims from\nthe inception of the case. See Hallman, 159 S.W.3d at 642 (“[A] dispute over attorneys fees is a\nlive controversy.”) (citing Camarena, 754 S.W.2d at 151).\n\nFor example, this Court has recognized that attorneys' fees may be awarded to a defendant\nunder the UDJA when the plaintiff who sought declaratory relief lacked standing to assert its\nclaims. See Galveston Cnty. Commissioner's Court v. Lohec, 814 S.W.2d 751, 754–55 (Tex.App.-\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

City of Dripping Springs, 304 S.W.3d 871, 891 (Tex.App.-Austin 2010,\npet. denied) (district court had jurisdiction to award attorneys' fees incurred in connection with\ndefense of plaintiff's claims over which the court determined plaintiff lacked standing).\n\n [26] [27] Standing, like mootness, is a component of subject matter jurisdiction. Tex. Ass'n of\nBus., 852 S.W.2d at 445. When a plaintiff lacks standing, the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\nId. at 444–45 (“[A] lack of standing deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction because standing\nis an element of such jurisdiction.”). In Lohec, when this Court found that the intervening plaintiff\nlacked standing to assert his declaratory judgment claims, this Court necessarily determined that\nit lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his claims from their inception. 814 S.W.2d at 754–55.\nNevertheless, this Court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to decide whether it would be\nequitable and just to award fees to the defendant. Id. at 755. Similarly, in City of Dripping Springs,\nin which the plaintiff argued, as Devon does here, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award\nfees under the UDJA because it lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims, the Austin Court of\nAppeals held that the court had authority to award fees. 304 S.W.3d at 891–92.\n\nDevon's argument and reliance on Samsung Electronics for the proposition that a court has\njurisdiction to award fees when a case becomes moot while the action is pending, but not when the\naction is moot from its inception, is misplaced because it is contrary to Texas law. According to the\nTexas cases interpreting the UDJA on which KCS relies, the absence of subject matter jurisdiction\nover Devon's claims at the inception of the litigation has no effect on whether KCS could recover\nits fees under the UDJA for defending against them when Devon's pleadings invoked the statute.\nWe therefore sustain KCS's cross-issue.\n\n\n\n                                              CONCLUSION\n\nWe hold that the trial court did not err in dismissing Devon's claims for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction because Devon's requested declaratory relief sought an impermissible advisory\nopinion concerning title to Louisiana mineral interests. We therefore affirm that part of the trial\n *224 court's judgment. We further hold that the trial court did not lose subject matter jurisdiction\nover KCS's counterclaim for attorney's fees when it determined that it lacked subject matter\njurisdiction over Devon's request for declaratory relief, and therefore the trial court erred when it\ndismissed KCS' claim for attorney's fees and costs under the UDJA. Accordingly, we reverse and\nremand for the trial court to determine whether, in its discretion, KCS is entitled to attorney's fees\nand costs arising from its defense against Devon's declaratory judgment action.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

FROST, concurring and dissenting.\n\nKEM THOMPSON FROST, Chief Justice, concurring and dissenting.\nThe trial court correctly concluded that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over both the plaintiff's\nclaims under the Texas Declaratory Judgments Act and the defendant's counterclaim for attorney's\nfees under that statute for defending against the plaintiff's claims. Therefore, this court should\naffirm the trial court's judgment in its entirety.\n\n\n\n  Recovery of Attorney's Fees under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 37.009\n\nAppellant/plaintiff Devon Energy Production Company, L.P. sued appellee/defendant KCS\nResources, L.L.C. asserting claims for declaratory relief under the Texas Declaratory Judgments\nAct. 1 KCS counterclaimed, asserting a variety of claims, but KCS later nonsuited all of them\nexcept its claim for reasonable and necessary attorney's fees incurred as a result of Devon's\ndeclaratory-judgment claims. KCS sought to recover these fees only under Texas Civil Practice\nand Remedies Code section 37.009, and there is no other apparent basis on which KCS might\nrecover these fees. 2 The trial court determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over both\nDevon's declaratory-judgment claims and KCS's section 37.009 claim and therefore dismissed all\nclaims without prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nIn determining parties' entitlement to attorney's fees, Texas courts follow the American Rule,\nwhich provides that litigants may recover attorney's fees only if a statute or contract specifically\nprovides for such a recovery. 3 Thus, in determining whether a party may recover attorney's fees,\nTexas courts must interpret and apply the statute or contract under consideration, rather than\ncrafting judge-made rules to supply the legal standard to be applied. 4 In today's case, the only\npossible authority under which KCS might recover attorney's fees is section 37.009.\n\n\nTo recover attorney's fees under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 37.009, the\nclaimant must do so in a proceeding under the Texas Declaratory Judgments Act, and a claim\nfor fees is not such a proceeding.\n\nSection 37.009, entitled “Costs,” provides in its entirety that “[i]n any proceeding under this\nchapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's *225 fees as are\nequitable and just.” 5 We are to review the trial court's interpretation of applicable statutes de\nnovo. 6 In interpreting a statute, our objective is to determine and give effect to the Legislature's\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

KCS's claim for these attorney's fees was ancillary to Devon's claims and\nthe trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Devon's claims. Thus, the trial court did not\nerr in dismissing all of these claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. 16\n\n *226 The issues raised by KCS's cross-appeal have not been addressed by a precedent from\nthe Supreme Court of Texas or from this court, and three sister courts of appeals have reached\nthe opposite conclusion. Without citing any authority in support of the proposition, the sister\ncourts determined that the absence of subject-matter jurisdiction over claims from filing through\ndismissal does not affect the nature of these claims. 17 But, the lack of jurisdiction is fundamental,\nand its absence has a material effect on both the trial court proceeding and the analysis of the issue\non appeal. The lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Devon's declaratory-judgment claims from\nthe moment of filing until the moment of dismissal makes the proceedings void. 18\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    23\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\nVarious federal courts of appeals have held in an analogous situation that a trial court's lack\nof subject-matter jurisdiction over claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct (“ERISA”) means that the court also lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over claims seeking\nattorney's fees under a statute giving trial courts discretion to award attorney's fees in an ERISA\naction. 19 Under this line of cases, in the absence of subject-matter jurisdiction over the ERISA\nclaims, there is no ERISA “action” in which attorney's fees could be awarded under the statute. 20\nThese cases provide persuasive authority in support of the conclusion that the trial court lacked\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over KCS's claim seeking attorney's fees under section 37.009. 21\n\nKCS cites two cases from the Supreme Court of Texas, Hallman and Camarena, 22 to support its\nposition. In the Camarena case, which did not involve section 37.009, the high court held that a live\nissue still existed between the parties as to whether the trial court erred in denying the plaintiff's\nrequest for attorney's fees even though it granted the plaintiffs the other relief they requested. 23\nThe Camarena court held that, although the issues regarding the other relief granted in the trial\ncourt's judgment later had become moot, the issue as to whether the trial court erred in denying\nthe plaintiff's request for attorney's fees was not moot. 24 Significantly, in Camarena, the trial\ncourt had subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims from filing through the initial rendition of\njudgment, and the fee request denied by the trial court addressed attorney's fees during the period in\nwhich the trial court *227 had subject-matter jurisdiction. 25 The Camarena court did not address\nwhether the plaintiffs were seeking fees for the time period after the other issues became moot or\nwhether the trial court had jurisdiction over such a request, and this silence does not create any\nprecedent on this issue. 26 In any event, there is a significant difference between a case in which\nthe trial court never has subject-matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims and a case in which\nthe trial court lost jurisdiction over the claims after rendition of judgment.\n\nThe Hallman case involved an appeal from the trial court's denial of attorney's fees requested\nunder section 37.009 in an insurance dispute in which other issues in the case became moot while\nthe case was pending in the Supreme Court of Texas. 27 The Hallman court held that the issue as\nto whether the insurer had a duty to defend was still a live controversy because it would determine\nwhether a remand was necessary for the trial court to consider whether to change its denial of the\nfee request in light the new prevailing party on that issue. 28 Even presuming that the insured was\nseeking attorney's fees for the period after the issues became moot, the case is not supportive of\nDevon's position because the Hallman court did not address whether the trial court had jurisdiction\nover such a request, and this silence does not create any precedent on this issue. 29\n\nIn Galveston County Commissioners' Court v. Lohec, this court reversed the trial court's ruling on\nthe merits of declaratory-judgment claims, held that one plaintiff lacked standing, and remanded\nto the trial court to consider the defendant's request for attorney's fees under 37.009. 30 The\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  24\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, 450 S.W.3d 203 (2014)\n\n\n\nSupreme Court of Texas disagreed with this court's disposition regarding the declaratory relief,\nreversed this court's judgment, and rendered judgment, so the case was never remanded. 31 In\nLohec, no party raised the issue of whether the trial court had jurisdiction over the defendants'\nrequests for attorney's fees against the plaintiff who lacked standing, and this court did not opine\non the matter. 32 The Lohec court did not address whether the trial court had jurisdiction over\nsuch a request, and the court's passing over this issue in silence does not create any precedent. 33\nThus, the issue appears to be one of first impression in this court. Instead of following the sister\ncourts of appeals, this court instead should look to the plain language of the statute and analogous\nfederal *228 authority and hold that the lack of subject-matter jurisdiction precludes an award\nof attorney's fees under section 37.009.\n\n\n\n                                                              Conclusion\n\nThe Texas Legislature has the authority and know-how to enact a statute providing that a trial\ncourt may award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees to a defendant who succeeds in having a\nplaintiff's declaratory-judgment claims dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. To date,\nthe Texas Legislature has not done so. The trial court correctly ruled that it lacked subject-matter\njurisdiction over Devon's declaratory-judgment claims; therefore, the proceedings relating to these\nclaims are void. Because there are no such proceedings, there is no basis for awarding KCS\nreasonable and necessary attorney's fees under section 37.009. KCS's claim for attorney's fees was\nancillary to Devon's claims, over which the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. The trial\ncourt did not err in dismissing all of these claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. To the\nextent this court reverses this ruling, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    A mineral servitude is “the right of enjoyment belonging to another for the purpose of exploring for and producing minerals and\n       reducing them to possession and ownership.” La.Rev.Stat. § 31:21.\n2      Because of our disposition of this issue, it is unnecessary to reach the parties' arguments concerning the applicability of the statute\n       of frauds.\n3      In its reply brief, Devon argues that KCS's counterclaims were live pleadings when the trial court initially granted KCS's summary-\n       judgment motion on March 27, 2012, and that the trial court's final judgment on March 25, 2013 “did nothing to alter its earlier March\n       27, 2012 order.” We note that the 2012 order denied Devon's request for declaratory relief and granted a take-nothing judgment\n       against Devon, while the 2013 order dismissed Devon's declaratory judgment action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and also\n       dismissed KCS's counterclaim for attorney's fees. Although the court ruled in KCS's favor in both orders, the basis for the rulings\n       and relief granted are distinctly different. Therefore, on these facts, we look to the state of the pleadings at the time the trial court\n       signed its final judgment.\n4      KCS argues that the operative pleading is Devon's first amended petition, and not the second amended petition, which Devon filed\n       after KCS moved for summary judgment but before the trial court's judgment was signed. Devon's first amended petition did not\n       request specific declarations, but set out each party's contentions concerning the Disputed Properties and merely requests that the\n       court declare the parties' intent under the PSA. For purposes of our analysis, however, the same dispute is reflected in both petitions.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

By two issues, appellant, Sherry Dunlap, contends the trial court erred in: (1) granting\nsummary judgment, and (2) awarding damages to Gayle pursuant to a contractual liquidated\ndamages provision. We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                             I. BACKGROUND\n\nIn November 2007, Dunlap and Gayle signed an earnest money contract for Dunlap to purchase\na house and acreage in Goliad County owned by Gayle, a real estate agent. 1 Pursuant to the\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  1\n\fDunlap v. Gayle, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 1500377\n\ncontract, Gayle provided Dunlap with a survey of the property. The contract provided that any\nparty wrongfully refusing to sign a release acceptable to the escrow agent of the $10,000 in earnest\nmoney was liable “to the other party for liquidated damages of three times the amount of the\nearnest money.”Dunlap failed to close by the date specified in the contract and refused to release\nthe earnest money to Gayle. Dunlap sued Gayle, asserting fraud and breach of contract. Gayle\ncounterclaimed, asserting that she was entitled to contractual liquidated damages of three times\nthe amount of the earnest money.\n\nGayle filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment and later filed a combined no-evidence/\ntraditional motion for summary judgment on Dunlap's claims and her own counterclaim. With\nregard to Dunlap's fraud allegation, Gayle asserted that Dunlap had no evidence: (1) that Gayle\nmade a material false representation to Dunlap; or (2) that Dunlap suffered damages. As to\nDunlap's breach of contract claim, Gayle asserted that Dunlap had no evidence that: (1) Dunlap\nperformed or was excused from performing under the contract; (2) Gayle breached the contract;\nor (3) Gayle's breach caused Dunlap damages. 2\n\nDunlap filed responses to Gayle's motions. 3 Dunlap attached an affidavit, dated May 23, 2011, to\nher first response and attached a second affidavit, dated November 22, 2011, to her supplemental\nresponse. Gayle objected to Dunlap's summary judgment evidence, arguing that both affidavits\nwere incompetent summary judgment evidence.\n\nOn November 30, 2011, the trial court granted Gayle's no-evidence/traditional motion without\nstating the basis for its ruling. The trial court also awarded Gayle actual damages in the amount\nof $30,000 and attorney's fees. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                     II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW\n\nA no-evidence motion for summary judgment under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i) is\nessentially a motion for pretrial directed verdict.Timpte Indus., Inc. v. Gish, 286 S.W.3d 306, 310\n(Tex.2009). A no-evidence motion for summary judgment is appropriate when there is no evidence\nof one or more essential elements of a claim on which the adverse party will bear the burden of\nproof at trial. TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(i); Scripps Tex. Newspapers, L.P. v. Belalcazar, 99 S.W.3d\n829, 840 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2003, pet. denied). The motion must be specific in challenging\nthe evidentiary support for an element of a claim or defense. Gish, 286 S.W.3d at 310. “When\nreviewing a no-evidence summary judgment, we ‘review the evidence presented by the motion\nand response in the light most favorable to the party against whom the summary judgment was\nrendered, crediting evidence favorable to that party if reasonable jurors could, and disregarding\ncontrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not.’”Id. (quoting Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez,\n206 S.W.3d 572, 582 (Tex.2006)).\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 2\n\fDunlap v. Gayle, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 1500377\n\n\n\n *2 When, as here, the trial court's order granting summary judgment does not state the grounds for\nits ruling, we must affirm the judgment if any of the grounds alleged in the motion are meritorious.\nW. Invs., Inc. v. Urena, 162 S.W.3d 547, 550 (Tex.2005). When a party moves for summary\njudgment under both rules 166a(c) and 166a(i) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as here,\nwe will first review the trial court's judgment under the standards of rule 166a(i).Ford Motor Co.\nv. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 600 (Tex.2004). If the non-movant fails to produce more than a\nscintilla of evidence under that burden, then there is no need to analyze whether the non-movant's\nsummary judgment proof satisfies the less stringent rule 166a(c) burden.

Fraud\nIn her motion, Gayle challenged the “material false representation” and damage elements of\nDunlap's fraud claim. Dunlap attached to her first response: (1) her May 23, 2011 affidavit; (2) a\nsurvey plat of the property, which showed a “trash dump” located on the property; (3) a “Seller's\nDisclosure Notice,” a standardized form which requires a seller to disclose certain prescribed\nproperty “conditions,” and which reflected that there was no “landfill” on the property 4 ; (4) a\nlegal description of the property; (5) a letter from Dunlap's counsel stating her refusal to release the\nearnest money; (6) the contract for sale of the property; and (7) a letter to Dunlap from the escrow\nagent stating that she would forfeit the earnest money if she failed to complete the purchase of the\nproperty by the closing date. In her response, Dunlap asserted that Gayle: (1) falsely represented\nthe property as “pristine”; and (2) stated in the written disclosures that there was no “landfill” on\nthe property, when the plat “show[ed] a landfill.” Dunlap's response states that Gayle breached\nthe contract by not disclosing the existence of the “landfill.”\n\nIn her supplemental response, Dunlap stated that she “did not want a trash dump or a landfill” and\nthat “these two words mean essentially the same thing to her.”Dunlap also asserted that she did\nnot receive the survey, which revealed the existence of the trash dump, “until the third [November\n2007] contract.”Dunlap attached to her supplemental response: (1) an excerpt from Gayle's no-\nevidence/traditional motion for summary judgment, in which Gayle asserted her counterclaim for\ncontractual liquidated damages; and (2) Dunlap's November 22, 2011 affidavit, in which she stated\nthat “[t]he words ‘trash dump’ and ‘land fill’ mean the same thing” to her, and that she “did not\nknow about the land fill or trash dump until the third contract.” 5\n\nDunlap asserts that the evidence of a material false representation about the property consists\nof: (1) Gayle's written representation that there was no landfill on the property; and (2) Gayle's\nstatement that the property was “pristine.” Gayle responds that: (1) her representation that there\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     3\n\fDunlap v. Gayle, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 1500377\n\nwas not a landfill on the property was not false; and (2) assuming that she described the property\nas “pristine,” the use of such a term was mere “puffing,” not a misrepresentation of material fact.\n\n *3 To establish fraud or misrepresentation, a plaintiff must show, among other things, that the\ndefendant made a false statement concerning a past or existing material fact. Ins. Co. of N. Am. v.\nMorris, 981 S.W.2d 667, 674 (Tex.1998). This element requires proof that when Gayle made the\nrepresentation, she “knew it was false or made it recklessly without any knowledge of the truth\nand as a positive assertion.”Id. A false representation may consist of a deceptive answer or any\nother indirect or misleading language, and a statement that is literally true may be actionable if\nused to create an impression that is substantially false. See Nelson v. Najm, 127 S.W.3d 170, 175\n(Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied).\n\n“Landfill” is defined as “a system of trash and garbage disposal in which the waste is buried\nbetween layers of earth to build up low-lying land—called also sanitary landfill.” MERRIAM\nWEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 654 (10th ed.1996). “Dump” is defined as “an\naccumulation of refuse and discarded materials” or “a place where such materials are dumped.”Id.\nat 359.Dunlap correctly notes that “dump” is the first synonym listed for “landfill.” Id. at 654.She\nargues that, although Gayle's representation that there was “no landfill” on the property could\ntechnically be true, it would nonetheless be fraudulent if it was used to create a substantially false\nimpression. Dunlap has offered no evidence, however, that when Gayle checked “no landfill”\non the standardized seller's disclosure form, she intended to create an impression that was\nsubstantially false. Gayle's affidavit unequivocally stated that the areas labeled “trash dump” on\nthe survey “is not a landfill.” Her affidavit further stated that, although she has burned trash in\nbarrels in the area labeled “trash dump,” “there has never been any trash simply dumped there and\nleft.”We conclude that the presence of a “trash dump” on the property did not render Gayle's “no\nlandfill” representation false.\n\nDunlap also points to Gayle's description of the property as “pristine” as evidence of a material\nfalse representation. In her affidavit, attached to her response, Dunlap asserted that Gayle\nrepresented that the property was “pristine.” Gayle argues that, even assuming that she described\nthe property as “pristine,” such a description is mere “puffing” or opinion, and cannot constitute\nfraud.\n\nGenerally, there are three factors courts consider when determining whether a statement is\nactionable, or mere puffing or opinion. Humble Nat'l Bank v. DCV, Inc., 933 S.W.2d 224, 230\n(Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ denied). We consider (1) the specificity of the alleged\nmisrepresentation, (2) the comparative knowledge between the buyer and seller, and (3) whether\nthe representation concerns past or present conditions, or future conditions.Id.; see also Helm v.\nKingston, No. 13–10–00224–CV, 2011 WL 6746064, at *6 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi Dec. 21,\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

An imprecise or vague representation constitutes a mere opinion.\nHumble Nat'l Bank, 933 S.W.2d at 230.\n\n *4 “Pristine” is defined in this context as “not spoiled, corrupted, or polluted (as by civilization),\npure.”MERRIAM WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY at 927. Dunlap asserted in her\naffidavit:\n\n  When I inspected the property, Cindy Gayle and I walked the border fence most of the way\n  around the property[;] however[,] when we got to the corner where I now know there is a land\n  fill, she distracted me and took me back to the house. She clearly was concealing the fact that\n  the property has a landfill. I have not seen the landfill location with my own eyes.\n\n  ....\n\n  I absolutely relied on her representation that the property was “pristine” and had no landfill\n  when I offered to buy the property.\n\nThe property consisted of approximately twenty-six acres and was improved with a house. 6 First,\nwe examine the specificity of the alleged misrepresentation. See Humble Nat'l Bank, 933 S.W.2d\nat 230. We conclude that as used in the present context—to describe property—the term “pristine”\nis vague and indefinite in meaning and therefore cannot constitute an actionable misrepresentation.\nSee Autohaus, Inc. v. Aguilar, 794 S.W.2d 459, 464 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1990, writ denied (holding\nthat representation that Mercedes was the best engineered car in the world was not actionable); see\nalso Bill & Jo Deane Bradford Invs., Inc. v. Cutter Aviation San Antonio, Inc., No. 04–04–00791–\nCV, 2005 Tex.App. LEXIS 9789, at *6, 2005 WL 3161083 (Tex.App.-San Antonio Nov. 23, 2005,\nno pet.)(mem.op.) (holding statement that an aircraft engine was “good, safe and reliable” was\nmere opinion or puffing).\n\nSecond, we compare the subject-matter knowledge of the buyer and seller, asking “whether or not\n[a statement's] correctness is a matter of which either of the parties can judge as well as the other,”\nand upon which the buyer can reasonably be expected, in the exercise of ordinary diligence, to\nhave formed his own opinion. See Aguilar, 794 S.W.2d at 463. Here, Gayle as the owner of the\nproperty was more familiar with it, and Dunlap claims that when she inspected the property, Gayle\n“distracted” her and deliberately prevented her from inspecting the area where the “trash dump”\nwas located. Nonetheless, we find that whether the property was “pristine” could be judged equally\nby either party and was a matter upon which Dunlap could have formed her own opinion through\nordinary diligence. 7 See id. at 464.\n\nThird, the alleged statement concerned a present condition, not a future condition, and therefore\nrequires greater scrutiny. See id .We hold that the alleged statement that the property was “pristine”\nis an expression of opinion, not a representation of fact.\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Gayle, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 1500377\n\n\n\nWe hold that Dunlap failed to present evidence of the “material false representation” element of\nher fraud claim, and the trial court did not err in granting no-evidence summary judgment as to\nher fraud claim. SeeTEX.R. CIV. P 166a(i).\n\n\nB. Breach of Contract\n *5 Gayle's no-evidence motion asserted that Dunlap had no evidence that: (1) Dunlap performed\nor was excused from performing under the contract; (2) Gayle breached the contract; or (3) Gayle's\nbreach caused Dunlap damages. In her affidavit, Dunlap stated that Gayle breached the contract\nby failing to “disclose the landfill” on the Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition. Dunlap's\nevidence included: (1) the Seller's Disclosure, which reflected that the property did not contain a\nlandfill, and (2) the survey showing the existence of a “trash dump.”\n\nTo establish that Gayle breached the contract by failing to “disclose the landfill,” Dunlap must\npresent evidence that a landfill actually exists. We have already determined that the presence of\na “trash dump” did not render Gayle's “no landfill” representation to be false. Dunlap's affidavit\nsimply asserts that there is a landfill on the property, even though she concedes that she “has not\nseen the landfill location with [her] own eyes.”Gayle's affidavit unequivocally states that there is\nno landfill on the property and that the area labeled “trash dump” on the survey is not a landfill.\nWe hold that Dunlap has not presented evidence establishing that Gayle breached the contract\nby failing to disclose a landfill. See id.We further hold that the trial court did not err in granting\nsummary judgment on Dunlap's breach of contract claim, and we overrule Dunlap's first issue.\n\n\nC. Damages\nBy her second issue, Dunlap contends the trial court erred in awarding Gayle $30,000 in actual\ndamages because the contract provision authorizing such damages is an unenforceable penalty.\nParagraph 18(D) of the contract provides: “Any party who wrongfully fails or refuses to sign a\nrelease acceptable to the escrow agent within 7 days of receipt of the request will be liable to the\nother party for liquidated damages of three times the amount of the earnest money.”The earnest\nmoney payable by Dunlap to Gayle under the contract was $10,000.\n\nGayle responds that Dunlap's claim that a liquidated damages clause is an unenforceable penalty\nis an affirmative defense, which Dunlap was required to plead and prove. Citing Phillips v.\nPhillips, Dunlap responds that pleading the defense is unnecessary when the unenforceability of\nthe liquidated damages provision appears on the face of the pleadings. See820 S.W.2d 785, 789\n(Tex.1991) (holding that the defense of penalty is not waived by the failure to plead it if it is\napparent on the face of the petition and established as a matter of law).\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   6\n\fDunlap v. Gayle, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 1500377\n\n\n  An assertion that a liquidated damages provision constitutes an unenforceable penalty is an\n  affirmative defense, and the party asserting penalty bears the burden of proof. Generally, that\n  party must prove the amount of actual damages, if any, to demonstrate that “the actual loss was\n  not an approximation of the stipulated sum.”If the amount stipulated in the liquidated damages\n  clause is “shown to be disproportionate to actual damages,” we should declare that the clause\n  is a penalty and limit recovery to actual damages.\n\n *6 SP Terrace, L.P. v. Meritage Homes of Tex., LLC, 334 S.W.3d 275, 287 (Tex.App.-Houston\n[1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.)(internal citations omitted).\n\nIt is undisputed that Dunlap did not plead or raise her penalty defense to the trial court. Dunlap\nargues that under Phillips, she did not waive her penalty argument because the liquidated damages\nprovision in the contract—providing for liquidated damages of three times the amount of the\nearnest money—was unenforceable on its face. We disagree.\n\nIn Phillips, the Texas Supreme Court found that a provision which provided for liquidated damages\nten times the amount of actual damages to be an unenforceable penalty. 820 S.W.2d at 789. The\ncourt found the provision did not meet the two-prong test for determining whether to enforce a\nliquidated damages provision. See id. at 788–89 (citing Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers, Inc.\nv. Campesi, 592 s.W.2d 340, 342 n. 2 (Tex.1979)). To enforce such a provision, the court must\nfind: (1) that the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) that the\namount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation. See id. at\n788.The provision at issue in Phillips did not meet the first prong of the test because it assumed\nthat actual damages must be determined before the “ten times” multiplier can be applied. See id.\nat 789.The provision did not meet the second prong of the test because it did not forecast actual\ndamages, but called for them to be determined and then multiplied. See id.\n\nThe liquidated damages provision in the present case does not call for multiplying the amount\nof actual damages, as in Phillips. See id.Rather, it calls for trebling the agreed-upon amount\nof earnest money. 8 For these reasons, we find Phillips to be inapposite. Dunlap neither pleaded\nthe affirmative defense of penalty nor presented evidence showing that the damage award was\nexcessive. We overrule her second issue.\n\n\n\n                                             IV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Gayle, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 1500377\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The parties signed two earlier contracts regarding the same property, one in September 2007 and another in October 2007. Dunlap\n       did not close on either of the two earlier contracts or on the November 2007 contract at issue in this case.\n2      We note that Gayle's first no-evidence motion for summary judgment asserted that Dunlap lacked evidence of these elements, as\n       well as other elements.\n3      Dunlap filed a response to Gayle's first no-evidence motion and later filed a “Supplemental Response.”\n\n4      A seller of residential real property is required to provide the buyer with a “Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition.” SeeTEX.\n       PROP.CODE ANN. § 5.008 (West Supp.2011).\n5      We note that only the first and last page of the November 22, 2011 affidavit appear in the record. The intervening pages, if any,\n       are missing.\n6      Although no house appears on the survey, Dunlap refers to the house in her affidavit, and Gayle's affidavit states that “the property\n       has a house, sewage and everything else required of a modern home.”\n7      We note that the parties dispute when Dunlap first received the survey reflecting the existence of a “trash dump.” Gayle's affidavit\n       states that Dunlap had the survey before she entered into the second and third (present) earnest money contracts. Dunlap asserts that\n       she did not receive the survey “until the third contract.”\n8      We note that the sales price in the contract was $460,000. Thus, the $10,000 earnest money was slightly more than 2% of the sales\n       price.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Businesspeople Personnel Services, Inc., 620 S.W.2d 861 (1981)\n\n\n\n [1] Defendant complains of the court's action in overruling his special exceptions because the\npetition was factually insufficient to allege a cause of action. The special exceptions, however, fail\nto point out that the petition is insufficient to allege grounds for injunctive relief. They complain,\nrather, that various allegations of the petition are conclusions of the pleader and are too vague\nand general to give defendant fair notice. Defendant does not show in what manner the generality\nof the pleadings deprived him of a reasonable opportunity to defend. He made no objection to\nplaintiff's evidence on the ground that it came as a surprise or was not within the scope of the\npleadings. Consequently, any error in overruling the special exceptions is waived. Banner Dairies\nv. Geers, 292 S.W.2d 169, 171 (Tex.Civ.App. El Paso 1956, writ dism'd); Pounds v.

Injunctive Relief\n\n [2] Defendant urges that there is no evidence, or insufficient evidence, to show that injunctive\nrelief is necessary for the protection of plaintiff's business and goodwill. Our review of the record\nreveals evidence sufficient to support the trial court's findings in this respect. The court found\nthat plaintiff had trained defendant as a job counselor in providing placement and counselling\nservices; that defendant had established and maintained substantial goodwill for plaintiff between\nhimself and plaintiff's clients and prospective clients; that defendant had access to confidential\nbusiness information, including lists of clients and business methods; that defendant resigned\nhis employment with plaintiff and began an employment agency business with his wife; that\nhe advertised the services of such agency and contacted various employers who were previous\nor prospective customers of plaintiff; that defendant had declared his intention to continue such\ncompetitive activities before he was restrained by the court; and that plaintiff's goodwill and its\nrelationship with its clients had been damaged. These findings support the court's conclusions\nthat defendant's actions constitute a material breach of his employment agreement and that\nthe injunction prayed for was reasonably necessary to protect plaintiff's goodwill from further\ncompetitive activities by defendant and safeguard plaintiff's confidential business information.\nConsequently, we hold that there is sufficient evidence to support the injunctive relief granted.\n\n [3] Defendant further contends that the contract was unenforceable because of wrongful conduct\nby plaintiff. Although defendant alleged certain breaches of the employment contract, the court\nmade no finding of fact as to that issue, and defendant made no request for additional findings\nas authorized by rule 298 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Consequently, this defense was\nwaived. Elliott v. Bowden, 564 S.W.2d 825, 828 (Tex.Civ.App. Corpus Christi 1978, writ ref'd n.\nr. e.); Micrea, Inc. v.

Businesspeople Personnel Services, Inc., 620 S.W.2d 861 (1981)\n\n\n\n [4] Defendant complains that the injunction in the terms of the contract is overbroad and is\nunenforceable for want of specificity. We cannot agree. The injunction restrains defendant from\nengaging in the business of a private employment agency or agent within a one-hundred mile\nradius from the Dallas County Courthouse until *863 February 15, 1982, and from assisting\nin the finding of employees for employers, or employment for employees for a commission or\nfee, within that area for that period. The injunction further restrains defendant from disclosing\nplaintiff's confidential records, business methods, and names of its customers and clients. This\ndecree conforms to the terms of the contract and we find from the record that it meets the test\nof reasonableness as to time and space established by Weatherford Oil Tool Co. v. Campbell,\n161 Tex. 310, 340 S.W.2d 950, 951 (1960). Consequently, it is valid and enforceable. Gonzales\nv. Norris of Houston, Inc., 575 S.W.2d 110, 113 (Tex.Civ.App. Houston (14th Dist.) 1978, writ\nref'd n. r. e.); Integrated Interiors, Inc. v. Snyder, 565 S.W.2d 350, 352 (Tex.Civ.App. Fort Worth\n1978, writ ref'd n. r. e.). Defendant has not suggested any manner in which it should be reformed\nso as to limit its scope in any other respect. Consequently, we need not consider whether such a\nreformation would be proper.\n\n\n\n                                                  3. Damages\n\nFinally, defendant urges that the trial court erred in awarding “liquidated damages” of $7,500\nbecause the evidence is insufficient to meet plaintiff's burden of proof as to reasonableness.\nPlaintiff makes no attempt to justify the award of $7,500 as based on evidence of actual damages,\nbut presents a counterpoint urging that it is entitled to recover the $10,000 liquidated damages\nstipulated in the contract. We conclude that the trial court's award of $7,500, which it characterized\nas “liquidated damages,” cannot be supported either as actual damages or as liquidated damages,\nand that the $10,000 payment stipulated is an unenforceable penalty in view of the specific\nenforcement of the contract by injunction.\n\n [5] [6] The award of $7,500 cannot be supported as actual damages because, as defendant\ncontends, the evidence does not establish any basis for the recovery of that amount. The only\ntestimony concerning damages was by plaintiff's president, who testified that he was unable to\nstate the amount of any damages from defendant's breach of the contract other than expenses\nof litigation, including attorney's fees and loss of time by himself and other employees. There\nwas no estimate of the amount of commissions lost because of defendant's competition in the\nperiod between the termination of his employment with plaintiff on February 15, 1980, until he\nwas restrained from further competition on March 4, 1980. The trial court found that plaintiff has\nexpended $5,000 for attorney's fees and expenses of suit. This record contains neither pleading nor\nproof supporting recovery of $7,500 as either a statutory or a contractual attorney's fee. Expenses\nof litigation are not recoverable as damages unless expressly provided by statute or contract.\nHammonds v. Hammonds, 158 Tex. 516, 313 S.W.2d 603, 605 (1958); Wm.

This rule applies to a litigant's loss of time. Phillips v. Latham, 523 S.W.2d 19, 27\n(Tex.Civ.App. Dallas 1975, writ ref'd n. r. e.).\n\nNeither is plaintiff entitled to recovery of the full $10,000 as the liquidated damages stipulated\nin the contract. Plaintiff argues that the liquidated damages provision is enforceable because the\namount stipulated is payable in lieu of actual damages that are difficult to ascertain. This argument\nis inconsistent with the petition, which alleges and prays for both actual and liquidated damages.\nIf this inconsistency is ignored, we must consider whether the provision for $10,000 liquidated\ndamages is a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm expected as a result of a breach;\notherwise the provision is an unenforceable penalty.

Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d\n484, 486 (1952); Restatement of Contracts, s 339 (1932).\n\nThe provision in question is as follows:\n\n            First Party and Second Party agree that the actual damages to First Party resulting\n            from any breach of this non-compete agreement by Second Party will be and are\n            uncertain, intangible and not readily or accurately ascertainable; that a fair *864\n            and reasonable estimate of the damages to First Party that will result therefrom\n            under the circumstances is Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00); and the parties\n            desiring to dispense with the high costs to each of litigating the issue of actual\n            damages; it is, therefore, agreed that in the event Second Party shall breach the\n            above non-compete covenant, he (she) shall pay to First Party the sum of Ten\n            Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) as liquidated damages which shall be in addition\n            to (and not in lieu of) First Party's right to specific performance of such covenant\n            by Second Party and the right to pursue same in a court of equity (injunctive\n            relief).\n\nIn support of the reasonableness of this provision, plaintiff argues that the trial court found that\nthe average fee earned by plaintiff was about $3,000 per placement. Plaintiff insists: “It is not\nunreasonable to estimate that within a two-year period at least (four fees) from such placements\n($12,000) would be lost due to the competition of an ex-employee.” This argument assumes that\ndefendant would not be restrained by injunction during the two-year period. Actually, defendant\nwas free to compete less than three weeks, and there is no evidence that plaintiff has lost any\nbusiness because of defendant's competition within that period or that defendant violated the\ninjunction after the restraining order was issued. If enforceable, the contract would exact a payment\nof $10,000 for any breach of the restrictive covenant, whether the breach continues for only one\nday or for two years, and would authorize an injunction enforcing the restriction for any portion\nof the period remaining. Under these circumstances the $10,000 cannot be considered a genuine\npre-estimate of the harm to be suffered by any single breach. 5A Corbin, Contracts, s 1071, at 401\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Consequently, it falls within the condemnation of Stewart v. Basey, supra, and other Texas\ndecisions holding that a stipulation for a liquidated damages should be treated as an unenforceable\npenalty if the contract contains several matters of different degrees of importance and the sum\nstipulated is payable for the breach of any, even the least. Accord: Krenek v. Wang Laboratories,\nInc., 583 S.W.2d 454 (Tex.Civ.App. Waco 1979, no writ); Servisco v. Tramco, Inc., 568 S.W.2d\n434, 437 (Tex.Civ.App. Texarkana 1978, writ ref'd n. r. e.).\n\n [7] The present contract may be enforceable if it is regarded as giving plaintiff an option to elect\nbetween injunctive relief and liquidated damages. Also, if actual damages are proved, plaintiff\nmay be entitled to damages for a breach that occurred before the suit was filed as well as to an\ninjunction restraining subsequent breaches. Payment of damages, however, constitutes satisfaction\nfor any injury that may be caused by the breach, whereas an injunction has the effect of a decree\nof specific performance restraining any breach that would otherwise cause damage. Therefore, if\nthe court grants an injunction preventing the breach from continuing and becoming total, it should\nnot at the same time give judgment for the full amount of liquidated damages specified in the\ncontract. Wirth & Hamid Fair Booking, Inc. v. Wirth, 265 N.Y. 214, 192 N.E. 297, 300-01 (1934);\n5A Corbin, Contracts, s 1071, at 401 (1964); see McMurray v. Faust, 224 Iowa 50, 276 N.W. 95,\n100 (1937); Heatwole v. Gorrell 35 Kan. 692, 12 P. 135, 138-39 (1886). The inconsistency of\nthese remedies is similar to that recognized by this court in Robert G. Beneke & Co. v. Cole, 550\nS.W.2d 321, 322 (Tex.Civ.App. Dallas 1977 no writ), in which we held that liquidated damages\ncould not be recovered in addition to actual damages, notwithstanding a provision in the contract\npurporting to authorize such a recovery.\n\nPlaintiff relies on Mayhall v. Proskowetz, 537 S.W.2d 320 (Tex.Civ.App. Austin 1976, writ ref'd\nn. r. e.) as supporting its contention that a provision for liquidated damages for competition by\na former employee is enforceable. In that case, however, there was no claim for injunction; thus\nliquidated damages were not, as here, recovered in addition to injunctive relief. Rather, the contract\nprovided for a liquidated sum of $5,000 because of the difficulty of proving *865 damages, and\nthat amount was presumably fixed in lieu of all other compensation as satisfaction for a breach\nthat might continue for the entire three-year period. Consequently, we do not regard Mayhall as\ncontrary to our holding in the present case.\n\n [8] Plaintiff also argues in support of the reasonableness of the liquidated damage provision that\nthe amount stipulated is based on anticipated expenses of litigation rather than loss of business\nand goodwill from defendant's breach. Plaintiff's president testified that he thought $10,000 was\nreasonable because of time already lost and attorney's fee already incurred, and that he chose the\n$10,000 figure because he knew that attorney's fees were expensive and that litigation would cause\nloss of time for him and other personnel involved. If the liquidated damage provision is based on\nan estimate of the attorney's fee, it does not conform to the requirement in Stewart, supra, 245\nS.W.2d at 487, that the damages be difficult of accurate estimation, because attorney's fees are\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Regardless of whether\na recovery of an attorney's fee would have been proper in this case if based on proper pleading\nand proof, which the present record does not show, we hold that an estimate of the attorney's fee\nand other expenses anticipated in enforcing a contract does not support the reasonableness of a\nprovision for liquidated damages.\n\nWith respect to the injunction, the judgment is affirmed, and with respect to the recovery of\ndamages, the judgment is reversed and judgment is rendered that plaintiff take nothing. Costs are\ndivided equally.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(TXUPM)\ncontracted to receive electricity and renewable energy credits (RECs) from wind farms owned\nby FPL Energy, LLC. FPL failed to provide the required electricity and RECs. TXUPM sued\nFPL for breach of contract; FPL counterclaimed, arguing TXUPM failed to provide FPL with\nsufficient transmission *61 capacity. The trial court granted two partial summary judgments.\nFirst, it issued a declaratory judgment that the contracts required TXUPM to provide transmission\ncapacity. Second, it declared the contracts' liquidated damages provisions unenforceable. The\nremaining issues were tried to a jury, and the trial court entered take-nothing judgments for both\nparties. Both parties appealed. The court of appeals reversed both summary judgment rulings. 328\nS.W.3d 580, 591 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2010, pet. granted).\n\nWe address the following issues: (1) did TXUPM owe FPL a contractual duty to provide adequate\ntransmission capacity to FPL; (2) if FPL breached and TXUPM did not, do the liquidated damages\nprovisions apply to energy and RECs or only to RECs; and (3) are the liquidated damages\nprovisions in these contracts enforceable? We affirm the court of appeals' holding that TXUPM\nowed no contractual duty to provide transmission capacity. However, we hold the liquidated\ndamages provisions apply only to RECs and are unenforceable as a penalty. Accordingly, we\nreverse the court of appeals' judgment in part and remand the case to the court of appeals to\ndetermine damages.\n\n\n\n                                I. Factual and Procedural Background\n\nIn Texas, the electric industry consists of three main components: power generation, power\ntransmission, and power distribution. Electric producers own and operate generating facilities.\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT), with few exceptions, manages the\ntransmission of electricity through an interconnected network—or grid—of transmission lines.\nFinally, retail electric providers distribute electricity directly to consumers.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 325\n\nIn 1999, the Legislature created ambitious goals for renewable energy in Texas. See Act of May\n27, 1999, 76th Leg., R.S., ch. 405, § 39, sec. 39.904, 1999 Tex. Gen. Laws 2543, 2598–99. The\nLegislature charged the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) with establishing minimum\nrenewable energy production requirements for all Texas electric providers. TEX. UTIL.CODE §\n39.904(c)(1). The Legislature also tasked the PUC with establishing a REC trading program. Id.\n§ 39.904(b). A REC reflects one megawatt hour (MWh) “of renewable energy that is physically\nmetered and verified in Texas.” 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(c)(13). Electric producers thus\nsimultaneously create both electricity from renewable sources and the corresponding RECs, yet\nproducers may choose to sell the two separately. Id. § 25.173(d). The REC trading program allows\nelectric providers unable to satisfy the minimum renewable energy requirements to purchase\nand hold RECs “in lieu of capacity from renewable energy technologies.” TEX. UTIL.CODE §\n39.904(b); see 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(d)(2).\n\nTXU Electric, a retail electric provider (and a different entity than TXUPM), solicited proposals\nfrom renewable energy producers to meet the new renewable energy production requirements. In\n2000, TXU Electric entered agreements with two wind farm subsidiaries of FPL: Pecos Wind I,\nL.P. and Pecos Wind II, L.P. Also in 2000, FPL acquired a third party's rights to a similar contract\nwith TXU Electric for Indian Mesa Wind Farm, L.P. Under the contracts, FPL sells TXU Electric\nRECs and the renewable electric energy used to produce those credits. TXU Electric assigned\nthe contracts to TXUPM, a power marketer and, importantly, not a retail electric provider. The\ncontracts with Pecos Wind I and II are identical. The Indian Mesa contract largely contains the\nsame provisions, but, as *62 explained below, the parties point to relevant differences in support\nof their claimed intent at the time of contracting. Two provisions of these contracts give rise to\nthis dispute: one provision governing TXUPM's transmission responsibilities and one providing\nfor liquidated damages in the event that FPL fails to meet certain production requirements.\n\nFor approximately four years, FPL failed to produce the agreed upon electricity and RECs.\nTXUPM filed suit seeking damages for FPL's breach of the contracts. FPL counterclaimed, arguing\nthat it could not meet its obligations because of congestion on the ERCOT grid. When the grid lacks\ncapacity to transmit all energy produced in an area, ERCOT issues curtailment orders instructing\ncertain facilities to cease production. FPL claims it received curtailment orders from ERCOT\nwhich, along with an unexpected lack of wind in the area, caused it to produce less energy than\npromised. FPL blamed the congestion and resulting curtailment orders on TXUPM, insisting that\nTXUPM bore responsibility to ensure transmission capacity for all energy FPL could produce.\n\nBoth parties filed motions for partial summary judgment. Each sought declaratory judgment to\nclarify the portions of the contracts relating to transmission capacity and liquidated damages.\nThe trial court issued several rulings. First, the court declared that the contracts unambiguously\nrequired TXUPM to provide all transmission services, including transmission capacity, to FPL.\nSecond, the court determined that the liquidated damages provisions in the contracts were not\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                3\n\fFPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Management Co., L.P., 426 S.W.3d 59 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 325\n\nenforceable, and thus void, because a liquidated damages amount of $50 per REC was not a\nrealistic forecast of damages.\n\nConsistent with these rulings, the trial court's instructions to the jury indicated that TXUPM was\nrequired to provide transmission capacity and that the liquidated damages were unenforceable.\nThe jury found that TXUPM should receive $8.9 million in compensatory damages for FPL's\nfailure to deliver renewable energy, yet the jury determined that TXUPM secured cover for the\nmissing electricity by acquiring substitute electricity. The jury also found that TXUPM owed no\ncompensatory damages to FPL for TXUPM's alleged failure to ensure transmission capacity. The\ntrial court entered judgment on the jury's verdict, ordering that (1) FPL take nothing on its claims;\nand (2) TXUPM take nothing, despite the jury's damage award, because TXUPM covered.\n\nThe court of appeals affirmed the take-nothing judgment for the damages claims but reversed and\nrendered judgment on the issues related to declaratory relief. 328 S.W.3d at 591. The court held that\nthe contracts did not require TXUPM to provide the necessary transmission capacity. Id. at 587.\nAs to liquidated damages, the court of appeals held that the provisions were enforceable because\ndamages were difficult to estimate, the $50 rate was a reasonable estimate of just compensation,\nand FPL could not meet its burden to show that the $50 rate was disproportionate to TXUPM's\nactual damages. Id. at 587–90.\n\nWe granted FPL's petition for review and address the three issues before us-whether TXUPM was\nresponsible for ensuring transmission capacity, whether the liquidated damages provisions apply\nto failure to deliver electricity, and whether the liquidated damages provisions are enforceable. 55\nTex.Sup.Ct.J. 320 (Feb. 17, 2012).\n\n\n\n                                        II. Contract Interpretation\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Before deciding the enforceability of the liquidated damages provisions,\nwe must resolve two matters of contract interpretation *63 —TXUPM's responsibility for\ntransmission capacity and the scope of the liquidated damages provisions. Our analysis begins\nwith the legal question of the contracts' ambiguity. See Dynegy Midstream Servs., Ltd. P'ship v.\nApache Corp., 294 S.W.3d 164, 168 (Tex.2009). If we can give a clear and definite legal meaning\nto a contract, it is not ambiguous as a matter of law. Gilbert Tex. Constr., L.P. v. Underwriters\nat Lloyd's London, 327 S.W.3d 118, 133 (Tex.2010). An ambiguous contract, however, has a\ndoubtful or uncertain meaning or is reasonably susceptible to multiple interpretations; we will not\nfind ambiguity simply because the parties disagree over a contract's meaning. Dynegy Midstream\nServs., 294 S.W.3d at 168. Our primary concern in contract interpretation is to “ascertain the true\nintentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument.” Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393\n(Tex.1983). We consider the entire writing to harmonize and effectuate all provisions such that\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 4\n\fFPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Management Co., L.P., 426 S.W.3d 59 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 325\n\nnone are rendered meaningless. Id. Further, we “construe contracts from a utilitarian standpoint\nbearing in mind the particular business activity sought to be served.” Frost Nat'l Bank v. L & F\nDistribs., Ltd., 165 S.W.3d 310, 312 (Tex.2005) (per curiam) (quoting Reilly v. Rangers Mgmt.,\nInc., 727 S.W.2d 527, 530 (Tex.1987)).\n\n\n\n                                        A. Transmission Capacity\n\n [6] We first consider whether the contracts require TXUPM to provide adequate transmission\ncapacity to FPL. The trial court and the court of appeals found section 2.03 unambiguous, a finding\nthe parties do not challenge. 328 S.W.3d at 584–85. We may, nonetheless, declare a contract\nambiguous, see J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 231 (Tex.2003), but we hold\nthat section 2.03, when construed in light of the entire contracts, has a definite legal meaning and,\nthus, is unambiguous. See Gilbert Tex. Constr., 327 S.W.3d at 133.\n\nSection 2.03(a) of the contracts, entitled “Transmission,” reads as follows:\n\n             TXU Electric shall provide, by purchasing or arranging for, all services,\n             including without limitation Transmission Services, Ancillary Services, any\n             control area services, line losses except for line losses on [FPL's] side of the\n             Delivery Point, and transaction fees, necessary to deliver Net Energy to TXU\n             Electric's load from the Renewable Resource Facility throughout the Contract\n             Term (“Required Transmission Services”).\n\nSection 1.02(a) of the contracts defines “Net Energy” as “the amount of electric energy in MWh\nproduced by the Renewable Resource Facility and delivered to the Connecting Entity.” (emphasis\nadded). Under section 2.02, a Connecting Entity owns any “transmission or distribution system\nwith which the Renewable Resource Facility is interconnected.” The Connecting Entity serves as\nthe “Delivery Point.”\n\nFPL urges a broad view of TXUPM's responsibility for transmission services. FPL contends\nthat TXUPM's obligation to provide transmission services “without limitation” encompasses the\ncapacity to deliver electricity from the Renewable Resource Facility (i.e. FPL) to the load (i.e.\nTXUPM's customer base). In support, FPL argues that Net Energy can refer only to a quantity\nand has no bearing on how and when delivery occurs. FPL further argues that the more specific\nlanguage, “from the Renewable Resource Facility,” should trump Net Energy, which is defined\nelsewhere in the contracts. See Forbau v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 876 S.W.2d 132, 133–34 (Tex.1994)\n(stating the rule that, in contract interpretation, a more specific provision will control over a general\n *64 statement). FPL points to congestion beyond the Delivery Point, explaining that as electricity\nis generated and delivered virtually simultaneously, it cannot stop and wait at the Delivery Point\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     5\n\fFPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Management Co., L.P., 426 S.W.3d 59 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 325\n\nfor congestion to clear. In a compelling visual, FPL suggests that the transmission towers might\nburn down if FPL generated and sent electricity without an available, guaranteed path to the\nconsumer. FPL complains that TXUPM caused the grid congestion and thus prompted the resulting\ncurtailment orders. 1\n\nTXUPM interprets the contracts as placing the risk of transmission system incapacity on FPL.\nTXUPM notes that the contracts identify “lack of transmission capacity” as an “Uncontrollable\nForce” outside the reasonable control of the parties. If capacity is beyond the control of the parties,\nTXUPM questions, how then can TXUPM bear responsibility for failure to provide capacity?\nSection 4.05 of the contracts reinforces this point by making clear that FPL must pay liquidated\ndamages for failure to supply RECs even if the failure was the result of inadequate transmission\ncapacity. Finally, TXUPM argues that the contracts' definition of Net Energy binds this Court;\nincorporating Net Energy, as defined, into section 2.03 means that TXUPM owes a duty to\nprovide transmission services only after the Delivery Point. Under TXUPM's interpretation, if FPL\ncould not deliver electricity because of congestion, FPL bore the risk and, thus, must bear the\nconsequences. We agree with TXUPM's interpretation.\n\nWe begin by recognizing the apparent textual conflict. Read in isolation, section 2.03 contains\nlanguage supportive of either a broad or narrow interpretation of TXUPM's transmission service\nresponsibilities. “[F]rom the Renewable Resource Facility” implies that TXUPM would have to\nsecure transmission capacity so FPL could deliver electricity. But the use of the term Net Energy,\nwhich exists only upon FPL's delivery to the Connecting Entity, suggests that TXUPM bears\nresponsibility only if the grid possesses capacity for TXUPM to deliver any generated electricity.\n\nWe cannot interpret a contract to ignore clearly defined terms, see Frost Nat'l Bank, 165 S.W.3d\nat 313, and, thus, we must accord Net Energy its due meaning. The contracts assigned TXUPM\nresponsibility only for transmission services required to deliver Net Energy, and Net Energy\nrepresents the amount of energy produced by FPL and delivered to the Connecting Entity.\nTXUPM's responsibility for transmissions services, then, begins once FPL-generated electricity\nreaches the Connecting Entity on the grid—the Delivery Point. The contracts' use of the phrase\n“from the Renewable Resource Facility” is simply a designation of where the energy originated. It\ndoes not alter the definition of Net Energy provided in section 1.02 or in other sections throughout\nthe contracts.\n\n *65 The placement of section 2.03 in the context of all interconnection requirements\nreinforces this conclusion. Section 2.02 requires FPL to “make all arrangements ... necessary\nto interconnect ... with a transmission or distribution system,” i.e. the Connecting Entity.\nTransmission systems are owned and operated by transmission service providers. See 16 TEX.\nADMIN. CODE § 25.5(143), (144). As between the original contracting parties, the contracts\nrequired a separate agreement to address interconnection if TXU Electric was the connecting\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   6\n\fFPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Management Co., L.P., 426 S.W.3d 59 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 325\n\nentity; the parties do not suggest any such agreement exists. Between TXUPM and FPL, no such\nagreement can exist because TXUPM, as a power marketer, cannot own transmission systems.\nSee id. § 25.5(83) (defining “power marketer” to exclude owners of transmission systems). The\ncontracts obligate FPL to secure interconnection with a Connecting Entity, or transmission service\nprovider, which under the PUC rules cannot be TXUPM. See id. § 25.5(83), (143). Reading\nsections 2.02 and 2.03 together, FPL must make all interconnection arrangements so that electricity\ncan reach the Delivery Point, and TXUPM must ensure that facilities exist beyond the Delivery\nPoint to allow for delivery to consumers. These provisions do not speak to the situation here,\nwhere both parties claim to meet their responsibilities but congestion on the grid inhibits energy\ngeneration and delivery.\n\n [7] Given these facts, then, we must consider which party is responsible for congestion beyond\nthe Delivery Point. While FPL blames grid congestion on TXUPM, we believe the contracts\nrecognize such congestion as beyond both parties' control. Section 6.02(a) of the contracts\naddresses “Uncontrollable Force,” including “[e]vents or circumstances that are outside of a Party's\nreasonable control,” which “may include ... lack of transmission capacity or availability.” The\ncontracts mention transmission capacity only in this section. Congestion and curtailment issues,\nwhich affect transmission capacity and availability, must fall within this provision. Section 6.02(b)\ngoes on to excuse a party from performance in the event of an Uncontrollable Force if certain\ncriteria are met; there is no dispute that FPL did not meet those criteria.\n\n [8] Section 4.05, entitled “Effect of Outages and Uncontrollable Force,” outlines the general rule\nthat payment and other calculations in sections 4.01–.10 are not impacted by Uncontrollable Force.\nThe exception to this rule, discussed below, applies to reduce the Annual Quantity of RECs that\nFPL must produce for TXUPM only when PUC substantive rules would excuse the shortfall. The\nexception does not excuse FPL from its obligation to deliver electricity. In essence, the contracts\nallocate the risk of curtailment and congestion to FPL by clearly establishing that such events affect\ncontract obligations only in certain instances not found here. We must respect and enforce this\nassignment of risk. See Gym–N–I Playgrounds, Inc. v. Snider, 220 S.W.3d 905, 912 (Tex.2007)\n(“Freedom of contract allows parties to bargain for mutually agreeable terms and allocate risks\nas they see fit.”).\n\nTo summarize, the contracts obligate FPL to interconnect with a Connecting Entity, which cannot\nbe TXUPM. TXUPM bears responsibility for providing transmission services from the Delivery\nPoint at the Connecting Entity. To the extent that lack of transmission capacity impairs electricity\ngeneration at the wind farms, the contracts provide that such lack of capacity is an Uncontrollable\nForce and FPL, therefore, bears the risk.\n\nWe note that this analysis does not fail because of the unique nature of electricity, *66 despite\nFPL's assertions. Admittedly, electricity generation, transmission, and distribution occur almost\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

But even if electricity moves too fast to pinpoint its physical location, the parties\ncertainly can conceptualize its location for the purpose of creating energy contracts like the ones\nin question today. Several contractual provisions make this clear: section 2.03(a) assigns FPL\nresponsibility for any loss of electricity on its side of the Delivery Point; and section 3.01(b) makes\nFPL responsible for maintenance and operational compliance with ERCOT guidelines for facilities\nup to the Delivery Point. This conceptualization of electricity's location pervades the contracts,\nand the parties assigned different responsibilities and liabilities based upon that understanding.\n\nHere, ERCOT issued curtailment orders, effectively constraining energy generation, rather than\nenergy transmission. FPL was therefore prevented from generating electricity and meeting its\ncontractual obligations. Although ERCOT made final curtailment decisions, that does not mean\nthat neither party bore the risk in the event of congestion and curtailment.\n\nWe hold that the contracts did not require TXUPM to provide transmission capacity for FPL but\nrather allocated risk of inadequate transmission capacity to FPL.\n\n\n\n                                          B. Liquidated Damages\n\nWe next consider the breadth of the liquidated damages provision in section 4.04. The court of\nappeals did not address the ambiguity of the section, and neither party argues the provision is\nambiguous. We conclude that the provisions are unambiguous because we may discern a definite\nlegal meaning by construing the provisions in light of each contract as a whole. See Gilbert Tex.\nConstr., L.P. v. Underwriters at Lloyd's London, 327 S.W.3d 118, 133 (Tex.2010).\n\nThe provisions state in relevant part:\n\n             If there is a Net Deficiency for a year.... [FPL] shall pay [TXUPM] a Deficiency\n             Payment equal to the product of (i) the difference in MWh between (a) the Net\n             Deficiency, and (b) the MWh of Transferred RECs, times (ii) the Deficiency\n             Rate. The Deficiency Payment is intended to be liquidated damages and not a\n             penalty.\n\nVastly simplified, a Net Deficiency occurs when FPL fails to meets its “Annual Quantity” REC\nquota, even taking into account past overproduction.\n\nSection 4.04(f) sets the Deficiency Rate as follows:\n\n             The initial Deficiency Rate is $50 per MWh, based upon the $50 per MWh\n             number in [PUC] Substantive Rule § 25.173. If the $50 per MWh in that Rule\n             is amended, then the Deficiency Rate is automatically adjusted to the amended\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   8\n\fFPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Management Co., L.P., 426 S.W.3d 59 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 325\n\n             number stated in that Rule. If [PUC] Substantive Rule § 25.173 is amended or\n             repealed without replacement so that the $50 number is no longer in the [PUC]\n             Substantive Rules, then the Deficiency Rate is $50. To the extent that the [PUC]\n             determines the annual average market value of RECs applicable to [TXUPM]\n             for a year, then the Deficiency Rate for that year will be the lesser of (i) the\n             $50 per MWh (as it may be later amended), and (ii) twice the annual average\n             market value of RECs applicable to [TXUPM] as determined by the [PUC]....\n             For a year for which there is a Deficiency Payment due, [TXUPM] shall make\n             reasonable efforts to obtain a determination of the annual average market value\n             of RECs by the [PUC], but nothing in this Section or in this Agreement obligates\n             [TXUPM] to turn in fewer RECs than are required of *67 it by the [PUC]\n             program administrator in order to obtain such a determination.\n\nTXUPM argues that the contracts cover both energy and RECs, and, therefore, the liquidated\ndamages clauses must apply to both. TXUPM reads subsections (d) and (f) in the context of\ncontract Article IV (sections 4.01–.10), entitled “Payment, Records, and Billings.” According to\nTXUPM, because FPL simultaneously produces RECs and energy, the parties simply use RECs\nas a counting mechanism for both, rather than a term limited strictly to RECs. In support, TXUPM\nreferences section 4.02, which provides the contracts' payment terms, whereby TXUPM must\npay FPL a unified price for an Annual Quantity of MWhs of Renewable Energy comprised of\nboth energy and RECs. Sections 4.03 and 4.04(a)-(c) outline a quarterly and annual reconciliation\nprocess to smooth any discrepancies based on the differences between continuous production of\nelectricity and the quarterly issuance of RECs. Section 4.04(d), the argument goes, necessarily\nincorporates the language used in the other sections. That section states: “[FPL] may elect to obtain\nand transfer RECs to [TXUPM] that were not produced at the Renewable Resource Facility to\ncompletely or partially offset the Net Deficiency ... not to exceed the sum of (i) 20% of the Annual\nQuantity, and (ii) the Uncontrollable Force Deficiency for that year.” Thus, TXUPM argues,\nSection 4.04(d) as a whole must refer to the Annual Quantity of both energy and RECs.\n\nIn response, FPL points to the absence of “Net Energy” or “Renewable Energy” anywhere in the\nliquidated damages provisions and highlights several clauses consistent with an exclusive focus on\nRECs. First, section 4.04(d), quoted above, contains a mechanism for FPL to deliver RECs from\nanother source if FPL cannot produce the RECs at its own facilities. That provision deals only\nwith RECs, and not electricity. Second, the Deficiency Rate is tied to the PUC's substantive rules\non REC penalties. 24 Tex. Reg. 9142 (1999), adopted 25 Tex. Reg. 82 (2000), amended by 32\nTex. Reg. 5165 (2007), proposed 32 Tex. Reg. 487 (former 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(o\n)) (Pub. Util. Comm'n of Tex.). The PUC rules impose penalties for failure to retire sufficient\nRECs, not for failure to deliver electricity. Id. Third, the Indian Mesa contract more clearly limits\nthe liquidated damages provision to RECs by eliminating the entire provision in the event that\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

For the reasons below, we hold that the liquidated damages clauses apply\nonly to RECs.\n\nAt the outset, we note that sophisticated parties have broad latitude in defining the terms of\ntheir business relationship. See Forest Oil Corp. v. McAllen, 268 S.W.3d 51, 58 (Tex.2008)\n(articulating the principle that Texas courts should uphold contracts “negotiated at arm's length\nby ‘knowledgeable and sophisticated business players' represented by ‘highly competent and able\nlegal counsel’ ” (quoting Schlumberger Tech. Corp. v. Swanson, 959 S.W.2d 171, 180 (Tex.1997)).\nWe must construe contracts by the language contained in the document, with a mind to Texas's\nstrong public policy favoring preservation of the freedom to contract. El Paso Field Servs., L.P.\nv. MasTec N. Am., Inc., 389 S.W.3d 802, 811–12 (Tex.2012); see also Cross Timbers Oil Co. v.\nExxon Corp., 22 S.W.3d 24, 26 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2000, no pet.)) (“In short, the parties strike\nthe deal they choose to strike and, thus, voluntarily bind themselves in the manner they choose.”).\nTherefore, the lack of reference to electricity or energy in the liquidated damages provisions is\ncritical.\n\nWhere the parties intended to address both energy and RECs, the contracts do *68 so. In section\n4.02, the payments are based on “all RECs and Net Energy produced by [FPL].” Section 4.03\ncontains explicit references to section 4.02 and the payments under section 4.02. The liquidated\ndamages provisions, in contrast, provide no such reference. We will not, as TXUPM urges,\nselectively import terms from other provisions to compensate for the absence of the term “energy”;\nrather, we conclude that the omission was intentional and deliberate. See Tenneco Inc. v. Enter.\nProds. Co., 925 S.W.2d 640, 646 (Tex.1996) (“We have long held that courts will not rewrite\nagreements to insert provisions parties could have included or to imply restraints for which they\nhave not bargained.”).\n\nThis interpretation does not conflict with, or render meaningless, any other provision of the\ncontracts. To the contrary, other provisions recognize that RECs often receive differential\ntreatment. Section 3.03(b) provides that if TXUPM cannot take delivery of electricity, FPL may\nsell electricity to the Connecting Entity, but must then sell the REC so produced to TXUPM.\nSection 4.04(d) allows FPL to cover REC deficiencies with RECs from other sources. These\ndistinctions make sense because an electricity provider may readily obtain RECs on the open\nmarket, whereas it is more difficult for providers to arrange for substitute electricity to meet their\ncommitments.\n\nSupport for differential treatment of RECs also flows from the regulatory scheme incorporated by\nreference into the contracts. Section 4.04(f) incorporates a Deficiency Rate from the PUC rules,\nthen found in Texas Administrative Code Title 16, section 25.173. 24 Tex. Reg. 9142 (1999),\nadopted 25 Tex. Reg. 82 (2000), amended by 32 Tex. Reg. 5165 (2007), proposed 32 Tex. Reg.\n487 (former 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(o )) (Pub. Util. Comm'n of Tex.). Section 25.173,\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                10\n\fFPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Management Co., L.P., 426 S.W.3d 59 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 325\n\nat the time of contracting, assignment, and breach, contained a mechanism for excusing REC\ndeficiencies due to events “beyond [the] reasonable control of the provider.” Id. Such events\nincluded lack of transmission capacity or curtailment orders from ERCOT. See id. (former 16 TEX.\nADMIN. CODE § 25.173(o )(4), (5)). The contracts incorporate this mechanism through section\n4.05, which reduces the Annual Quantity to the extent that Administrative Code section 25.173\nexcused penalties for REC deficiencies. In sum, the contracts reduce FPL's REC obligations when\nthe PUC provides an excuse for the deficiency.\n\nThe very inclusion of the Deficiency Rate, which reflects the actual penalty TXUPM would have\nto pay for a REC deficiency, suggests the liquidated damages clause was intended to compensate\nonly for REC deficiencies. To underscore this point, we note that when the parties entered the\ncontracts, TXU Electric was subject to regulatory penalties for REC deficiencies. See id. (former\n16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(c)(1)). If FPL failed to deliver both electricity and RECs, and\nTXU Electric consequently could not meet its REC requirements, the PUC would assess a penalty\nagainst TXU Electric. The liquidated damages clause would yield $50 per REC, or the equivalent\nof the regulatory penalty. This would compensate TXU Electric for the undelivered REC, but what\nabout the undelivered electricity? Liquidated damages would provide no compensation to TXU\nElectric for FPL's failure to deliver electricity. This belies TXUPM's assertion that the provisions\nwere intended to compensate for both RECs and electricity. We conclude that the liquidated\ndamages clauses compensate for REC deficiencies and leave common law remedies available for\nelectricity deficiencies.\n\n*69 The Indian Mesa contract further solidifies our interpretation. Section 10.02 of the Indian\nMesa contract provides that “if RECs cease to exist, then Section 4.03 and Section 4.04 of this\nAgreement will be automatically deleted.” This section preserves the agreement as an electricity-\nonly contract if RECs disappear. Because the liquidated damages provision becomes a nullity\nwithout RECs, we must conclude that the provision is intended to compensate only for REC\ndeficiencies. To do otherwise would render the provision meaningless, and this we cannot do. See\nCoker, 650 S.W.2d at 393.\n\nLimiting the liquidated damages provisions to their plain language also has the benefit of\nadvancing stability in the renewable energy marketplace, including the vital role of RECs. Under\nthe legislative scheme, RECs and energy are “unbundled.” TEX. UTIL.CODE § 39.904(b);\nERCOT Nodal Protocols § 14.3.2(1) (January 1, 2013). Electric providers may either generate\ntheir own renewable energy or purchase RECs on the open market. 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE\n§ 25.173(d), (l ). Though FPL and TXUPM chose to contract for both in this case, we should\nnot allow that fact to cloud our analysis. As amici curiae REC stakeholders have pointed out, a\ncontrary holding could impede the REC market, which facilitates renewable energy development\nby allowing prospective electric producers to secure a guaranteed long-term revenue stream. Yet\nif, as TXUPM urges, “REC” does not mean only REC, substantial uncertainty may arise regarding\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 325\n\nthe desirability of such investments, the meaning of existing contracts, the negotiation of future\ncontracts, and the ease of regulatory compliance. We are loath to interfere with a functioning\nmarket when the language of the contracts does not so require.\n\nThe plain language of the liquidated damages provisions, the differential treatment of RECs and\nelectricity in the contracts, and the separate provisions of the Indian Mesa contract all support a\nlimited interpretation of a REC. We hold that the liquidated damages provisions apply only to\nREC deficiencies.\n\n\n\n                              III. Enforceability of Liquidated Damages\n\n [9] We next consider the enforceability of the liquidated damages provisions when applied only\nto RECs. FPL contends that the provisions impose an unenforceable penalty when applied to\ncompensate only for REC deficiencies. Although TXUPM argues primarily that the provisions\nreasonably forecast damages for electricity and RECs—a position foreclosed by our holding in\nthis case—TXUPM's arguments regarding the difficulty of estimation of REC-based damages\nand the reasonableness of the forecast of damages still resonate. Because the liquidated damages\nprovisions fail our test for enforceability, however, we hold the provisions unenforceable.\n\n [10] [11] [12] The basic principle underlying contract damages is compensation for losses\nsustained and no more; thus, we will not enforce punitive contractual damages provisions.\nSee Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484, 486 (1952). In Phillips v. Phillips, we\nacknowledged this principle and restated the two indispensable findings a court must make to\nenforce contractual damages provisions: (1) “the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult\nof estimation,” and (2) “the amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of\njust compensation.” 820 S.W.2d 785, 788 (Tex.1991) (citing Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers,\nInc. v. Campesi, 592 S.W.2d 340, 342 n. 2 (Tex.1979)). We evaluate both prongs of *70 this\ntest from the perspective of the parties at the time of contracting. 2 In Phillips we recognized that,\nunder this test, a liquidated damages provision may be unreasonable “because the actual damages\nincurred were much less than the amount contracted for.” 820 S.W.2d at 788. A defendant making\nthis assertion may be required to prove the amount of actual damages before a court can classify\nsuch a provision as an unenforceable penalty. Id. While the question may require a court to resolve\ncertain factual issues first, ultimately the enforceability of a liquidated damages provision presents\na question of law for the court to decide. Id.\n\n\n\n                                  A. Difficulty of Estimating Damages\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                12\n\fFPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Management Co., L.P., 426 S.W.3d 59 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 325\n\nWe first consider the difficulty of estimating damages at the time of contracting. TXUPM\nemphasizes the uncertainty of the market for RECs. FPL counters that all parties knew a REC\nmarketplace would soon exist and provide transparent pricing by the time the obligations under the\ncontracts became due. We agree with TXUPM that damages for RECs were difficult to estimate\nat the time of contracting.\n\nThe implementing legislation for the REC scheme passed in 1999, Act of May 27, 1999, 76th\nLeg., R.S., ch. 405, § 39, sec. 39.904, 1999 Tex. Gen. Laws 2543, 2598–99, but at the time of\ncontract formation in 2000, the market for RECs did not yet exist. The nature of FPL's obligation\ncompounded the difficulty. The contracts required FPL to deliver an annual quantity of RECs.\nTXUPM could not identify the specific time, and thus the spot price in the REC market, in order\nto calculate the damage for any specific REC deficiency. Even if the contracts anticipate a healthy\nmarketplace for RECs, the uncertain success of a novel legislative scheme surely poses a challenge\nto predicting damages. Indeed, as explained previously, the Indian Mesa contract foresaw the\npotential disappearance of the REC scheme and provided for continuation of the contract in the\nevent of the scheme's demise. The uncertain marketplace for RECs suffices to meet the “difficulty\nof estimation” prong of the contractual damages test.\n\n\n\n                                B. Reasonableness of Damage Forecast\n\nWe next turn to the second prong, the reasonableness of the forecast of damages. FPL argues\nthat the liquidated damages provisions, which derive directly from the regulatory penalty scheme,\nimpose the maximum penalty in all situations. FPL points to an ameliorative provision in the\npenalty regulations that excuses REC deficiencies due to lack of transmission capacity or the\nactions of a governmental authority, such as an ERCOT curtailment. See 24 Tex. Reg. 9142 (1999),\nadopted 25 Tex. Reg. 82 (2000), amended by 32 Tex. Reg. 5165 (2007), proposed 32 Tex. Reg. 487\n(former 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(o )) (Pub. Util. Comm'n of Tex.). Many of TXUPM's\ncounter-arguments are inextricably tied to contractual damages provisions *71 based on RECs\nand electricity, and we need not acknowledge those arguments here. TXUPM does assert, however,\nthat the liquidated damages provisions were not intended as indemnity clauses and therefore are\nnot limited to application only if TXUPM were actually assessed a penalty.\n\nWe view the reasonableness of the forecast from the time of contracting. E.g., Mayfield v. Hicks,\n575 S.W.2d 571, 576 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.); accord RESTATEMENT\n(SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356 cmt. b (1981) (identifying the time of making a contract\nas the moment to measure the reasonableness of anticipated loss). We are not persuaded, as FPL\nurges, to attach a “penalty” label merely because the liquidated damages clause derives from a\n“penalty” scheme; that does not, standing alone, make it a penalty. Stewart, 245 S.W.2d at 486\n(“[T]he courts will not be bound by the language of the parties.”).\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 325\n\n\n\nAlthough the initial per-REC deficiency rate is $50, the contracts also provide:\n\n             To the extent that the [PUC] determines the annual average market value of\n             RECs applicable to [TXUPM] for a year, then the Deficiency Rate for that year\n             will be the lesser of (i) the $50 per MWh (as it may be later amended), and\n             (ii) twice the annual average market value of RECs applicable to [TXUPM] as\n             determined by the [PUC].\n\nThe contracts thus anticipate that the amount of damages may be tied to market value, rather than\nan arbitrary number. Further, section 4.05 of the contracts anticipates that the PUC substantive\nrules will affect the REC requirements:\n\n             The exception ... is that the Annual Quantity for a year is decreased to the extent\n             that [TXUPM] is excused from paying a penalty by reason of any event under\n             Section 25.173(o )(4) and (5) of the [PUC] Substantive Rules that adversely\n             affected production of RECs by the Renewable Resource Facility in that year.\n\nAs discussed above, former PUC rules, then found in Title 16, Section 25.173 of the Texas\nAdministrative Code, excused REC deficiencies due to lack of transmission capacity or\ncurtailment orders. 24 Tex. Reg. 9142 (1999), adopted 25 Tex. Reg. 82 (2000), amended by 32\nTex. Reg. 5165 (2007), proposed 32 Tex. Reg. 487 (former 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(o\n)) (Pub. Util. Comm'n of Tex.). The contracts therefore contemplate that REC obligations of the\nparties, and the resulting damages, are a product of and intertwined with the regulatory scheme.\nThe liquidated damages provisions attempt to integrate these ameliorative processes, and thus, on\ntheir face, reasonably forecast damages.\n\nYet the facts of this case demonstrate the chasm between the liquidated damages provisions as\nwritten and the result of the provisions under the court of appeals' judgment. First, the number of\ndeficient RECs varies significantly between TXUPM's assertion and what the regulatory scheme\nwould indicate. FPL had a collective deficiency of 580,000 RECs, yet 62% (or about 360,000)\nwere not produced because of transmission congestion and associated ERCOT curtailment orders,\nwhich are excused by the PUC rules. Id. TXU Electric was subject to PUC penalties for REC\ndeficiencies at the time of contract formation. Id. (former 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(c)\n(1)). Upon assignment to TXUPM, a power marketer, no party was subject to PUC penalties.\nSee 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.5(83) (defining power marketer as an wholesaler seller of\nelectricity who does not own generation, transmission, or distribution facilities in Texas, which\nwould exclude TXUPM from REC penalties). This change in relationship did *72 not undermine\neach contract, but it fundamentally changed the basis for the liquidated damages provisions. Those\nprovisions presuppose that TXU Electric or its successors would respond to potential penalties\nfor REC deficiencies. When those successors have no REC penalty obligations, they may, as\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 14\n\fFPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Management Co., L.P., 426 S.W.3d 59 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 325\n\noccurred here, fail to secure a regulatory excuse for deficiencies that would obviate any need for\nthe liquidated damages provisions. If the PUC could assess a penalty against TXUPM, the penalty\nwould be based on the 220,000 RECs attributable to lack of wind, not congestion.\n\nSecond, the Deficiency Rate calculation failed to tie the damages to market value as the contracts\ncontemplate. Section 4.04(f) of the contracts allows for a Deficiency Rate of either $50 or twice\nthe annual average market value of RECs “[t]o the extent that the [PUC] determines the annual\naverage market value.” The PUC expressly declined TXUPM's request for such a determination.\nThe actual market value of a REC during the period in question ranged from $4 to $14. The fortuity\nof a PUC determination thus utterly controls the damages, irrespective of the actual market value.\nFor instance, the appropriate amount of damages should fall in the range of $8 to $28 (twice the\naverage market value), depending on what the PUC would have determined as the actual market\nvalue of a REC in each year.\n\nIn combination, this creates an unacceptable disparity. The court of appeals assessed damages\nat $29 million. If we use the REC deficiency of 220,000 (as reduced under PUC rules), and the\nreduced Deficiency Rate of $28 (the upper bound of the possible range), actual damages equal\nonly $6,160,000. To reach damages of $29 million on a 220,000 REC deficiency would require an\neffective deficiency rate of $132 per REC. The disparity grows if we consider that TXUPM also\navoided the contract price of $24 per MWh of Renewable Energy—which includes a REC and a\nMWh of electricity. Although only a portion of the $24 is attributable to the REC not purchased,\nit nonetheless would further diminish TXUPM's actual damages. In Phillips, we recognized that\na liquidated damages provision may be unreasonable in light of actual damages. 820 S.W.2d at\n788. The burden of proving unreasonableness falls to FPL. See id. The court of appeals held that\nFPL failed to meet this burden, yet the court's evaluation was based on evidence of damages for\nelectricity and RECs. 328 S.W.3d at 589–90. Our holding on the scope of the liquidated damages\nclauses limits our consideration to damages for REC deficiencies. The evidence reviewed in this\nopinion demonstrates that FPL has met its burden.\n\nPhillips did not create a broad power to retroactively invalidate liquidated damages provisions that\nappear reasonable as written. See 820 S.W.2d at 788. Nor do we create such a power here. But\nwhen there is an unbridgeable discrepancy between liquidated damages provisions as written and\nthe unfortunate reality in application, we cannot enforce such provisions. The forecast of damages\nwas flawed by its reliance on events that did not and perhaps cannot occur—a PUC determination\nof the market value of RECs and a failure to secure a regulatory excuse for curtailment-based\nREC deficiencies. When the liquidated damages provisions operate with no rational relationship\nto actual damages, thus rendering the provisions unreasonable in light of actual damages, they are\nunenforceable. See id. Because the liquidated damages provisions operate as a penalty, we hold\nthe provisions unenforceable.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

FPL's briefs, however, do not pursue these arguments. FPL\n        petitioned this Court to review the meaning of the contracts as to TXUPM's obligations to provide transmission services, not TXUPM's\n        alleged role in creating congestion.

(Garden Ridge) sued Advance International, Inc., and Herbert\nA. Feinberg (collectively, Advance) for breach of contract and a declaratory judgment that\nGarden Ridge had *435 complied with its contracts with Advance. Advance counterclaimed for\nbreach of contract. The jury found in favor of Advance. Although Garden Ridge accepted two\nshipments of inflatable snowmen from Advance, Garden Ridge refused to pay anything for either\nshipment, claiming that one shipment was nonconforming. Garden Ridge based its refusal to pay\non chargeback provisions outlined in the parties' contracts. Advance argued that the chargeback\nprovisions are unenforceable penalties.\n\nOn appeal, Garden Ridge argues that the trial court committed reversible error when it (1) refused\nto submit a question on prior material breach, (2) improperly instructed the jury on damages,\nand (3) commented on the weight of the evidence in its instructions on breach of contract. We\nconclude that the chargeback provisions as applied in this case are unenforceable as a matter of\nlaw as penalties, and we overrule Garden Ridge's jury charge issues. We therefore affirm the trial\ncourt's judgment.\n\n\n\n                         I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nGarden Ridge is a Houston-based chain of housewares and home décor stores. Advance\nInternational, a company owned by Feinberg, is one of Garden Ridge's vendors. In 2009, Advance\nsent Garden Ridge quote sheets for lighted inflatable holiday snowmen, which included a color\nphoto of each item and described its cost, weight, dimensions, and packaging. The two snowmen\non the quote sheets each wore a scarf, held a broom that stated “Merry Christmas” on it, and waved;\none stood eight feet tall, and the other stood nine feet tall. We refer to this snowman as “waving\nsnowman.” Advance then sent two sample snowmen 1 to Garden Ridge; one of the samples did not\nmatch its quote sheet. The sample eight-foot snowman wore a Santa-type hat and held a “Merry\nChristmas” banner. We refer to this snowman as “banner snowman.”\n\nGarden Ridge sent Advance two purchase orders, one for approximately 950 nine-foot waving\nsnowmen (PO #721), and the other for approximately 3,500 eight-foot waving snowmen (PO\n#743), based on the quote sheets. Garden Ridge planned to sell each nine-foot waving snowman for\n$59.99, and each eight-foot waving snowman for $39.00. Garden Ridge planned to mark down the\neight-foot waving snowmen to $20.00 each during its one-day Thanksgiving Shop–a–Thon sale,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                2\n\fGarden Ridge, L.P. v. Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\nand it prepared and had printed an advertising circular promoting this special price and picturing\nthe eight-foot waving snowman.\n\nFive days before Thanksgiving, Garden Ridge realized that the eight-foot snowmen that Advance\nsent were not waving snowmen, but instead were banner snowmen. The nine-foot snowmen that\nAdvance sent were waving snowmen. Garden Ridge decided to honor the $20.00 Shop–a–Thon\nprice on the nine-foot waving snowmen. There were no customer complaints, and both the eight-\nfoot banner snowmen and the nine-foot waving snowmen sold well.\n\nThe parties' contracts consist of the purchase orders, the vendor cover letter, and the vendor\ncompliance manual. Based on liquidated-damages provisions outlined in the vendor compliance\nmanual, Garden Ridge assessed chargebacks against Advance for its alleged noncompliance\nviolations. For Advance's “purchase order” violation—by sending the eight-foot banner snowman\ninstead of the waving snowman, Garden Ridge charged back to Advance the entire merchandise\ncost plus the cost of freight on PO #743 as a “unauthorized substitution” chargeback, which\ntotaled *436 $49,176.00. In addition to paying nothing for the eight-foot banner snowmen,\nGarden Ridge paid nothing for the nine-foot waving snowman despite the fact that those snowmen\ncomplied with PO #721. Garden Ridge charged back to Advance the entire merchandise cost\nplus the cost of freight on the nine-foot waving snowmen as a “merchant initiated” chargeback,\nwhich totaled $29,178.00. Additionally, from September through November 2009, Garden Ridge\nassessed another $13,241.84 in noncompliance chargebacks to Advance on other merchandise\nfor “ticketing/packing” violations involving not marking cartons sequentially or otherwise\nmislabeling them, and for “purchase order” violations involving short or incomplete orders.\n\nAdvance demanded payment for its snowmen and other items and staged protests at Garden\nRidge's headquarters. Thereafter, Garden Ridge sued Advance for breach of contract and a\ndeclaratory judgment that Garden Ridge had complied with the contracts. Advance counterclaimed\nfor breach of contract and asserted that Garden Ridge's claims were barred because the chargeback\nprovisions are unenforceable as penalties. Garden Ridge defended against Advance's counterclaim\nby asserting that Advance breached the contracts first.\n\nAt trial, Garden Ridge's divisional merchandise manager/vice president Linda Troy admitted that\nGarden Ridge made approximately $113,000 in profit on the snowmen it received from Advance,\nand further testified that Garden Ridge made all the money it would have made if the snowmen\nwere delivered exactly as ordered. One of Garden Ridge's buyers, Sheria Cole, admitted she\ndid not know of any dollar amount that Garden Ridge was harmed by the snowmen shipment\nand that Garden Ridge had less-than-zero receipt cost for the snowmen. Cole also testified that\nshe was unaware of anyone at Garden Ridge having done any actual-harm calculations from\nthe unauthorized substitution of the eight-foot banner snowmen or any calculations to determine\nwhether Garden Ridge's chargebacks were reasonably proportional to any actual harm it suffered.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\nGarden Ridge acknowledges that it did not argue any amount of actual damages other than zero\nand that the record reflects no actual damages resulting from Advance's noncompliance violations.\n\nThe trial court granted Advance's motion for directed verdict on Garden Ridge's breach-of-contract\nclaim because of lack of evidence on damages resulting from Advance's noncompliance violations,\nbut did not grant Advance's motion for directed verdict on Garden Ridge's declaratory-judgment\nclaim or Advance's motion for directed verdict seeking to have Garden Ridge's chargeback\nprovisions declared legally unenforceable as penalties.\n\nThe trial court submitted to the jury questions on Garden Ridge's declaratory-judgment claim\nand on Advance's breach-of-contract claim, but refused to submit a question on Garden Ridge's\nprior-material-breach defense. On Garden Ridge's declaratory-judgment claim, the jury found\nthat Garden Ridge did not comply with the terms of the three listed agreements (to purchase the\neight-foot snowmen, to purchase the nine-foot snowmen, and to purchase other items listed in the\n“summary of chargebacks” exhibit). On Advance's breach-of-contract claim, the jury found that\nGarden Ridge failed to comply with these agreements by failing to pay for the eight-foot snowmen,\nthe nine-foot snowmen, and other items listed in the chargeback exhibit. The jury, in separate\nfindings, awarded Advance damages in the amount of $49,176.00 for the eight-foot snowmen,\n$29,781.00 for the nine-foot snowmen, and $500.00 for other items listed in the chargeback\nexhibit. The trial *437 court rendered final judgment on the jury's verdict and on a stipulation\nfor legal fees.\n\nGarden Ridge appeals the trial court's final judgment, arguing in three issues that the trial court\ncommitted reversible error in its jury charge. First, Garden Ridge contends that the trial court\nerred in refusing to submit a jury question on Garden Ridge's affirmative defense of prior material\nbreach. Second, Garden Ridge argues that the trial court erred by improperly instructing the jury in\nthe damages question on the reasonableness of Garden Ridge's chargebacks. Third, Garden Ridge\ncomplains that the trial court's inclusion of instructions on acceptance and contract price in the\nbreach-of-contract question were improper comments on the weight of the evidence.\n\n\n\n                                                 II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Refusal to submit prior-material-breach question\nGarden Ridge concedes that it is not entitled to a jury question on prior material breach if this court\ndetermines that the chargeback provisions are unenforceable as penalties. Thus, we first proceed\nto address the legal question of whether the chargeback provisions are enforceable.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    4\n\fGarden Ridge, L.P. v. Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\n\n\n\n       1. Do the chargeback provisions at issue assess liquidated damages or penalties?\n\nThe parties agree that this case is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted by\nTexas, which applies to transactions involving goods. TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.102\n(West 2009). 2 The parties agree that section 2.718(a) of the UCC, on liquidation of damages,\ngoverns the enforceability of the chargeback provisions in this case. Section 2.718(a) provides:\n\n\n   (a) Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount\n      which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the\n      difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an\n      adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.\n   Id. § 2.718(a). The parties also agree that if the chargeback provisions governing Advance's\n      noncompliance violations at issue are unenforceable as penalties, Garden Ridge no longer\n      has any basis to argue that Advance committed any prior material breach. 3 But what the\n      parties do not agree on is the proper analysis by which courts determine the legal question of\n      whether a liquidated-damages provision is unenforceable as a penalty.\n\n\n         a. Determining whether a liquidated-damages provision constitutes a penalty\n\n [1] [2] Whether a contractual provision is an enforceable liquidated-damages provision *438 or\nan unenforceable penalty is a question of law for courts to decide. Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d\n785, 788 (Tex.1991) (citation omitted). The party asserting that a liquidated-damages clause is a\npenalty provision bears the burden of pleading and proof. See id. at 789 (citing TEX.R. CIV. P. 94).\n\n [3] “Liquidated damages” ordinarily refers to an acceptable measure of damages that parties\nstipulate in advance will be assessed in the event of a contract breach. Flores v. Millennium\nInterests, Ltd., 185 S.W.3d 427, 431 (Tex.2005) (citing Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164\nS.W.3d 656, 664 (Tex.2005)). “The common law and the Uniform Commercial Code have long\nrecognized a distinction between liquidated damages and penalties.” Id. (citing TEX. BUS. &\nCOM.CODE § 2.718(a), and Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484, 485–86 (1952)).\nSection 2.718(a) codified the common-law distinction between liquidated damages and penalties\nas part of Texas' adoption of the UCC's article on sales. Id. at 432.\n\n [4] In Phillips v. Phillips, the Texas Supreme Court restated the common-law test for determining\nwhether to enforce a liquidated-damages provision. 820 S.W.2d at 788. “In order to enforce a\nliquidated damages clause, the court must find: (1) that the harm caused by the breach is incapable\nor difficult of estimation, and (2) that the amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    5\n\fGarden Ridge, L.P. v. Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\nforecast of just compensation.” Id. (citing Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers, Inc. v. Campesi,\n592 S.W.2d 340, 342 n. 2 (Tex.1979), and comparing to TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 2.718(a)).\nThe Phillips court explained that one way a party can “show that a liquidated damages provision\nis unreasonable” is by showing that “the actual damages incurred were much less than the amount\ncontracted for,” which requires the party “to prove what those actual damages were.” Id. Thus, in\nsuch a case, “factual issues must be resolved before the legal question can be decided.” Id. Phillips,\nhowever, involved no fact issues because the contractual provision at issue “by which one party\nagrees to pay the other some multiple of actual damages for breach of the agreement does not\nmeet either part of the legal test for an enforceable liquidated damages provision.” Id. at 789. The\nPhillips court therefore declared the provision at issue—which called for “liquidated damages ten\ntimes the amount [the limited partner] loses as a result of” a breach of trust—unenforceable as a\npenalty on its face. Id. at 787, 789.\n\nThe common-law test as described in Phillips closely tracks the language of section 2.718(a) of\nthe UCC. The code allows damages to be liquidated “only at an amount which is reasonable in\nthe light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss,\nand the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.” TEX. BUS.\n& COM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a). It further states: “A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated\ndamages is void as a penalty.” Id. The first clause of section 2.718(a)—“reasonable in the light\nof the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach”—correlates to “reasonable forecast of just\ncompensation,” from the common-law test. See id.; Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. The second and\nthird clauses of section 2.718(a)—“the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-\nfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy”—correlate to “that the harm caused by\nthe breach is incapable or difficult of estimation,” from the common-law test. See TEX. BUS. &\nCOM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a); Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. Further, the sentence that “[a] term\nfixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is *439 void as a penalty” under section 2.718(a)\ncorrelates to “a liquidated damages provision is unreasonable because the actual damages incurred\nwere much less than the amount contracted for.” See TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a);\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. We therefore conclude that the common-law test as described in\nPhillips and the UCC test as outlined in 2.718(a) reflect the same essential factors and the same\ntype of reasonableness test. Thus, common-law case law continues to inform our analysis here.\n\n\n\n                                       b. Do actual damages matter?\n\nGarden Ridge argues that the test is conducted entirely on an ex ante basis. That is, if, at the time\nthe contract is formed, actual damages are difficult to estimate and the amount specified in the\ncontract is a reasonable forecast of just compensation, a liquidated-damages term is enforceable.\nGarden Ridge contends that the test contains no ex post actual-harm assessment to determine\nreasonableness. Thus, according to Garden Ridge, Advance could only show that the chargeback\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   6\n\fGarden Ridge, L.P. v. Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\nprovisions were unenforceable as penalties if, ex ante, actual damages are easy to estimate or the\nliquidated damages are based on an unreasonable forecast. Garden Ridge asserts that Advance did\nnot meet its burden because Garden Ridge's CFO, Bill Uhrig, testified that the chargeback schedule\nwas created because actual damages from noncompliance violations are difficult to calculate, and\nthat the schedule was based on computations and estimations by Garden Ridge's executive and\npurchasing staff.\n\nGarden Ridge primarily relies on two cases from the Dallas Court of Appeals. See GPA Holding,\nInc. v. Baylor Health Care Sys., 344 S.W.3d 467 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2011, no pet.); Baker v. Int'l.\nRecord Syndicate, Inc., 812 S.W.2d 53 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1991, no writ). Neither of these cases,\nhowever, supports Garden Ridge's position that the test is to be conducted solely on an ex ante\nbasis.\n\nIn GPA Holding, the appellate court found that GPA, a third-party administrator for self-funded\nhealth plans, did not meet its burden to establish that a “clause requiring payment of normal billed\ncharges [instead of the original provider discounted rates] after 45 days” in GPA's hospital services\nagreement with Baylor was an unenforceable penalty. 344 S.W.3d at 476. GPA did not prove that\n“the harm from late payment is [not] difficult to estimate, or that the normal billed charges were an\nunreasonable forecast of the loss actually sustained.” Id. (emphasis added). Nothing in the GPA\nHolding court's analysis precludes a consideration of reasonableness based on actual damages;\nand in fact, the court assessed Baylor's actual damages, i.e., whether the normal billed charges\nwere a “reasonable amount for the health care services and supplies provided in the charges at\nissue in this case.” Id.\n\nIn Baker, while the appellate court noted that evidence related to the difficulty of estimation and\nthe reasonableness of the damages forecast should be viewed as of the time the contract was\nexecuted, or the “anticipated harm” test, the court also expressly stated: “Additionally, liquidated\ndamages must not be disproportionate to actual damages. If the liquidated damages are shown to be\ndisproportionate to the actual damages, then the liquidated damages can be declared a penalty....”\n812 S.W.2d at 55. The Baker court called this the “actual harm” test: “The party asserting this\ndefense is required to prove the amount of the other party's actual damages, if any, to show that\nthe actual loss was not an approximation of the stipulated sum.” Id. This “actual harm” test is\nentirely consistent with what the Texas *440 Supreme Court stated in Phillips, that a party can\nshow unreasonableness based on “the actual damages incurred [being] much less than the amount\ncontracted for.” 820 S.W.2d at 788.\n\nThis court also has recognized that actual harm factors into the test to determine whether a\nliquidated-damages provision is an enforceable penalty. In Chan v. Montebello Development Co.,\nwe described the Phillips test as follows: “The test for determining whether a provision is valid\nand enforceable as liquidated damages is (1) if the damages for the prospective breach of the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\ncontract are difficult to measure; and (2) the stipulated damages are a reasonable estimate of\nactual damages.” Chan v. Montebello Dev. Co., No. 14–06–00936–CV, 2008 WL 2986379, at *3\n(Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] July 31, 2008, pet. denied) (citing Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788).\nFurther, we stated:\n\n            In order to meet this burden, the party asserting the defense is required to\n            prove the amount of the other parties' actual damages, if any, to show that\n            the liquidated damages are not an approximation of the stipulated sum. If the\n            liquidated damages are shown to be disproportionate to the actual damages, then\n            the liquidated damages must be declared a penalty....\n\nId. at *3–4 (citations omitted).\n\nMost importantly, the UCC reasonableness test explicitly refers to actual harm, providing that\none way a liquidated-damages provision can be invalidated is where the stipulated amount proves\nunreasonable in light of “the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach.” TEX. BUS. &\nCOM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a) (emphasis added). In addition, the UCC expressly provides that\n“[a] term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.” Id.; see id. cmt.\n1. In order to determine whether a term fixes unreasonably large liquidated damages, it follows\nthat courts would need to consider what actual harm, if any, was caused by the breach and then\ncompare it to the stipulated amount of liquidated damages.\n\n [5] Thus, both the common law and the UCC allow for courts to determine the reasonableness\nof a liquidated-damages clause by considering whether the defendant has shown that the\nstipulated amount was “unreasonably large” compared to the actual damages. See TEX. BUS. &\nCOM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a); Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788.\n\n\n\n       c. Comparing the amount of the chargebacks to Garden Ridge's actual damages\n\n [6] Advance argues that it proved that the harm anticipated from its alleged noncompliance was\nnot difficult to estimate, that Garden Ridge did not even attempt to determine a chargeback amount\nthat was reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual harm, and that the liquidated damages\nGarden Ridge assessed are disproportionate to its actual damages. We conclude Advance met its\nburden to show that the chargeback amounts constituted a disproportionate estimation of Garden\nRidge's actual damages; therefore, the chargeback provisions are void as penalties under the UCC.\n\nAdvance elicited evidence from Garden Ridge employees Troy and Cole sufficient to prove that\nGarden Ridge suffered no actual damages as a result of Advance's substitution of the eight-\nfoot banner snowmen. The trial court also determined that Garden Ridge suffered no actual\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.              8\n\fGarden Ridge, L.P. v. Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\ndamages from any of Advance's noncompliance violations when the court directed a verdict\nagainst Garden Ridge on its breach-of-contract claim; Garden Ridge does not challenge that ruling.\nAnd Garden Ridge *441 itself acknowledges it argued no amount of actual damages other than\nzero and the record shows that Garden Ridge suffered no actual damages resulting from Advance's\nnoncompliance violations.\n\nThus, Advance has shown that the chargebacks assessed by Garden Ridge for Advance's\n“unauthorized substitution” and “merchant initiated” noncompliance violations—100% of the\ninvoiced merchandise cost plus freight for the eight-foot banner snowmen and the nine-foot\nwaving snowmen, for a total of $79,457.00—were unreasonably large when compared to Garden\nRidge's actual damages of zero. Advance also has shown that the additional chargebacks assessed\nby Garden Ridge for Advance's “short or incomplete order,” “carton markings,” and “cartons\nnot numbered correctly” noncompliance violations on other merchandise—totaling approximately\n$13,000—were unreasonably large when compared to Garden Ridge's actual damages of zero.\nTherefore, as a matter of law, we conclude that, under these circumstances, 4 the chargeback\namounts were unreasonable, and that the chargeback provisions are unenforceable as penalties\nunder the UCC because they fixed unreasonably large liquidated damages. Accordingly, we\noverrule Garden Ridge's first issue.\n\n\n\n                            d. Whether the amount of the chargebacks is\n                       reasonable in light of Garden Ridge's anticipated harm\n\n [7] Even if the concurring opinion is correct that Advance also had to prove the stipulated\ndamages were unreasonable in light of the anticipated harm in order for us to conclude that the\nchargeback provisions are unreasonable under section 2.718(a), we conclude that Advance has\ndone so in this case. As explained in subsection II.A.1.c., Advance has shown that the stipulated\namounts are unreasonable in light of the actual harm—zero—suffered by Garden Ridge. Further,\nAdvance has shown that the stipulated amounts are unreasonable in light of the harm anticipated\nby Garden Ridge.\n\nHere, according to the challenged liquidated-damages provisions, Garden Ridge anticipated at the\ntime of contract that an unauthorized substitution of any type would result in harm of 100% of the\ncost of the merchandise, plus freight. In fact, Garden Ridge's buyer Cole testified that Garden Ridge\nhad the discretion to assess the full 100% chargeback, even if the only deviation in the snowmen\nhad been green versus red buttons. Cole further testified that she was not aware of any instance\nwhere Garden Ridge had decided not to issue a chargeback because there was “no harm, no foul”\nor where Garden Ridge had exercised its discretion to not charge back “fully” for an unauthorized\nsubstitution. Garden Ridge's CFO Uhrig agreed that a button-color substitution would constitute\nnoncompliance, for which Garden Ridge could charge back the full 100% of merchandise cost.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  9\n\fGarden Ridge, L.P. v. Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\nIn other words, no matter what the degree of substitution, and no matter whether the substitution\nis even anticipated to result in any harm, Garden Ridge's unauthorized-substitution rule provides\nthat Garden Ridge keeps the merchandise without paying the vendor anything *442 and makes\nthe vendor cover the freight.\n\nEven though, according to Uhrig, Garden Ridge is “very good at estimating our costs,” he admitted\nthat at the time it was developing the chargeback schedule Garden Ridge did not perform any\nactual studies on what costs it would incur due to vendor noncompliance. Further, Uhrig could\nnot explain any specifics on how Garden Ridge “figure[d] out what the costs are and what would\nbe appropriate charge-backs.” Cole also testified that she was not aware of Garden Ridge having\nperformed any analysis as to whether the 100% chargeback amount reasonably approximates the\nanticipated harm that Garden Ridge would suffer from an unauthorized substitution. Despite this\nlack of detail regarding the 100% chargeback amount for anticipated harm from vendor violations,\nUhrig testified that “on average” charging back 100% somehow reflected Garden Ridge's costs for\nunauthorized substitutions. Uhrig further indicated that Garden Ridge's chargebacks communicate\nto vendors, “Don't do this”; and Garden Ridge's CEO, Tim Kibarian, agreed that chargebacks are\nthe “penalty” if its vendors do not follow its rules.\n\nWe therefore conclude that Advance has proven that Garden Ridge's liquidated-damages\nprovisions do not reasonably reflect Garden Ridge's anticipated harm for an unauthorized\nsubstitution, where the challenged provisions allowed Garden Ridge to charge back 100% of\nmerchandise cost plus freight for any unauthorized substitution, no matter how slight and no matter\nif Garden Ridge even anticipated incurring any harm.\n\n\nB. Instruction on damages\n [8] Garden Ridge next argues that the trial court committed reversible error by including the\nfollowing instruction as part of its question on Advance's damages:\n\n            The unauthorized substitution provision in the Vendor Compliance Manual is\n            unreasonable if the actual damages that Garden Ridge incurred were much less\n            than the charge-back amount.\n\nDuring the charge conference, Garden Ridge objected to the inclusion of this instruction as\nimproper because whether the chargeback provisions constitute penalties was a question reserved\nfor the court, not the jury. Garden Ridge further objected that the trial court should not include this\ninstruction because it would permit the jury to assess damages on a basis that is not permitted in\nthe law—that is, there is no actual-damages component to whether a liquidated damages provision\nis unreasonable and thus constitutes a penalty. 5 The trial court overruled Garden *443 Ridge's\nobjections, which properly are preserved for our review. See Thota v. Young, 366 S.W.3d 678,\n689 (Tex.2012).\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  10\n\fGarden Ridge, L.P. v. Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\n\n\n [9] [10] [11] [12] We review a trial court's decision whether to submit a particular instruction\nin its charge for abuse of discretion. Id. at 687 (citing In re V.L.K., 24 S.W.3d 338, 341 (Tex.2000));\nCity of Houston v. Proler, 373 S.W.3d 748, 760 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no. pet. h.)\n(citing Shupe v. Lingafelter, 192 S.W.3d 577, 579 (Tex.2006)). The trial court has considerable\ndiscretion to determine proper jury instructions, and “[i]f an instruction might aid the jury in\nanswering the issues presented to them, or if there is any support in the evidence for an instruction,\nthe instruction is proper.” Thota, 366 S.W.3d at 687 (quoting La.-Pac. Corp. v. Knighten, 976\nS.W.2d 674, 676 (Tex.1998)). “An instruction is proper if it (1) assists the jury, (2) accurately states\nthe law, and (3) finds support in the pleadings and evidence.” Id. (citing Columbia Rio Grande\nHealthcare, L.P. v. Hawley, 284 S.W.3d 851, 855–56 (Tex.2009)). We will not reverse a judgment\nfor a charge error unless that error was harmful because it “probably caused the rendition of an\nimproper judgment” or “probably prevented the petitioner from properly presenting the case to the\nappellate courts.” Id. (citing Tex.R.App. P. 44.1(a) and 61.1); Proler, 373 S.W.3d at 760 (citing\nLa.-Pac. Corp., 976 S.W.2d at 676 (Tex.1998)); see also Bed, Bath & Beyond, Inc. v. Urista, 211\nS.W.3d 753, 757 (Tex.2006). We examine the entire record to determine whether the instruction\nprobably caused an improper judgment. Thota, 366 S.W.3d at 686–87; Urista, 211 S.W.3d at 757.\n\n [13] As discussed above in subsection II.A.1.b, a party can prove that a liquidated-damages clause\nis unenforceable and void as a penalty if it shows that the actual damages incurred by the other\nparty are much less than or disproportionate to the contracted-for amount. The complained-of\ninstruction here essentially tracks the language from Phillips—that a liquidated-damages provision\nis unreasonable and unenforceable as a penalty “because the actual damages incurred were much\nless than the amount contracted for.” See 820 S.W.2d at 788. Therefore, the instruction properly\nstated the “actual harm” portion of the common-law test. Id.; see also Chan, 2008 WL 2986379, at\n*3. Further, the complained-of instruction correlates to the equivalent portion of the UCC test that\n“[a] term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.” TEX. BUS.CODE\nANN. § 2.718(a).\n\n[14] However, because the instruction concerns whether the chargeback provisions are\nunreasonable and thus unenforceable as penalties, which is a legal issue for the trial court to decide,\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788, we conclude that the trial court improperly submitted this instruction 6\nto the jury. The complained-of instruction describes a reasonableness *444 analysis that the trial\ncourt itself was supposed to conduct—this instruction, despite its proper statement of the law,\nwould not assist the jury. See Thota, 366 S.W.3d at 687. Moreover, although the Phillips court\nindicated that in some cases the jury might have to resolve a factual issue before the trial court\ncan decide the ultimate legal question of enforceability, here, no fact issues remained; the trial\ncourt already had found that Garden Ridge suffered no breach-of-contract actual damages due to\nAdvance's noncompliance violations when the court directed a verdict against Garden Ridge on\nthat claim. See 820 S.W.2d at 788. As a matter of law, these chargebacks were unreasonable and\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\nvoid as penalties; “consequently, [the instruction] w[as] surplusage, expressly prohibited by the\nTexas Supreme Court in Acord v. General Motors Corp., 669 S.W.2d 111, 116 (Tex.1984).” Bean\nv. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 965 S.W.2d 656, 664 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.);\nsee also Elloway v. Pate, 238 S.W.3d 882, 896 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.)\n(citing Acord, 669 S.W.2d at 116). The trial thus abused its discretion by unnecessarily instructing\nthe jury on the reasonableness of Garden Ridge's chargebacks.\n\n [15] [16] Our review of the record reveals, however, that this abuse of discretion was harmless. 7\nIncluding a surplus instruction on the law is only harmful when it amounts to a comment on the\nweight of the evidence. Bean, 965 S.W.2d at 664 (discussing Acord, 669 S.W.2d at 113, 116).\nAlthough the trial court instructed jurors about a potential situation where Advance's damages may\nbe reduced to essentially nothing—that is, if Garden Ridge's chargebacks actually were reasonable\nand thus enforceable as a matter of law—including this instruction was not “reasonably calculated\nto cause [nor] probably did cause prejudicial harm to appellant[ ]” Garden Ridge. See Acord,\n669 S.W.2d at 116 (citation omitted). Moreover, by including this instruction, the trial court “did\nnot offer [its] opinion, assume the truth of a material fact, exaggerate, minimize, or withdraw\nrelevant evidence.” See Bean, 965 S.W.2d at 664. Therefore, including the surplus instruction did\nnot constitute a comment on the weight of the evidence.\n\nNor did including the improper instruction mislead or confuse the jury in its determination of\ndamages on Advance's breach-of-contract claim. Advance presented evidence relating to over\n$92,000 in chargebacks Garden Ridge assessed, and evidence that these chargebacks reflected\nwhat Garden Ridge deducted from Advance's merchandise invoices. The jury's answers to what\nwas “the difference between what Garden Ridge agreed to pay and what it actually paid for [the]\nsnowmen” reflect that the jury considered the contract rate as what Garden Ridge agreed to pay for\nthe nine-foot and eight-foot snowmen within PO #721 and PO #743, which included collection of\nfreight, and that Garden Ridge actually paid nothing whatsoever to Advance for these snowmen.\nThus, the jury found that for the snowmen Advance had proven its full amount of damages—that\nthe differences reflected the exact amounts Garden Ridge charged *445 back. The jury's answer\nto what was “the difference between what Garden Ridge agreed to pay and what it actually paid\nfor other items charged back on [Advance's] Exhibit” reflects that the jury considered the evidence\npresented on the remaining approximately $13,000 in chargebacks and determined that Advance\nhad proven damages on $500 of these other chargebacks. Therefore, the erroneous instruction did\nnot probably cause the rendition of an improper judgment; and we overrule Garden Ridge's second\nissue.\n\n\nC. Instructions on breach of contract\nIn its final issue, Garden Ridge argues that the trial court's inclusion of the UCC's definition\nregarding what constitutes the acceptance of goods—section 2.606(a) 8 —and the UCC's provision\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               12\n\fGarden Ridge, L.P. v. Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\nthat the buyer must pay the contract rate for goods it accepts—section 2.607(a) 9 —in its\ninstructions to the jury on Advance's breach-of-contract claim constituted an impermissible\ncomment on the weight of the evidence. During the charge conference, Garden Ridge objected\nto the inclusion of these instructions as unnecessary because Garden Ridge did not dispute that it\naccepted the goods. Garden Ridge thus contends that these “surplusage” instructions improperly\n“nudged” the jury toward Advance's theory of the case. The trial court overruled Garden Ridge's\nobjections, which properly are preserved for our review. See Thota, 366 S.W.3d at 689.\n\nThis is a UCC breach-of-contract case in which Advance pleaded, and presented evidence, that\nGarden Ridge breached by accepting and then not paying the contract price for the snowmen and\nother goods at issue. The parties do not dispute that their contracts are governed by the UCC.\nSection 2.606(a) and section 2.607(a), the sources of the trial court's instructions, are located\nin the UCC subchapter concerning “Breach, Repudiation, and Excuse.” Further, both of these\ninstructions properly state the law. TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.606(a) & 2.607(a) (West\n2009). These instructions thus are proper because they (1) assisted the jury in answering the breach\nquestion, (2) accurately stated the law, and (3) found support in the pleadings and evidence. See\nThota, 366 S.W.3d at 687 (citing Hawley, 284 S.W.3d at 855–56). We therefore conclude that the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by submitting the complained-of trial instructions.\n\n\n\n                                              III.

In construing a statute, our objective is\nto determine and give effect to the Legislature's intent. See Nat'l. Liab. & Fire Ins. Co. v. Allen,\n15 S.W.3d 525, 527 (Tex.2000). If possible, we must ascertain that intent from the language the\nLegislature used in the statute and not look to extraneous matters for an intent the statute does\nnot state. Id. If the meaning of the statutory language is unambiguous, we adopt the interpretation\nsupported by the plain meaning of the provision's words. St. Luke's Episcopal Hosp. v. Agbor, 952\nS.W.2d 503, 505 (Tex.1997). We must not engage in forced or strained construction; instead, we\nmust yield to the plain sense of the words the Legislature chose. See id.\n\n\n\n                                    Interpretation of the Statutory Text\n\nAdvance, as the party asserting that the liquidated-damages provisions are penalties, had the\nburden of proving that these provisions do not satisfy the applicable legal standard for an\nenforceable liquidated-damages provision under Section 2.718(a). Baker v. International Record\nSyndicate, Inc., 812 S.W.2d 53, 55 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1991, no writ). Under the plain meaning of\nSection 2.718(a), it was incumbent upon Advance to establish that the amount of damages set by\nthe provisions in question was not reasonable in light of the anticipated harm and the actual harm\ncaused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of\notherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. See TEX. BUS. & COMM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a).\n\nBoth Section 2.718(a) and Texas common law provide that a liquidated-damages provision is\nenforceable as long as it is not a penalty. See id.; Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 788\n(Tex.1991) (discussing legal standard under Texas common law). But, to prove that a provision\nis a penalty under Texas common law, a party must prove that (1) the harm caused by the breach\nis not incapable or difficult of estimation, or (2) that the amount of liquidated damages called for\nis not a reasonable forecast of just compensation. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. The Supreme\nCourt of Texas has indicated that a party may prove that the amount of liquidated damages is not\na reasonable forecast of just compensation under the common-law test only by showing that the\nactual damages incurred were much less than the liquidated-damage amount. See id.\n\nAs can be seen by comparing the legal standard under Section 2.718(a) and the legal standard\nunder Texas common law, the two legal standards are significantly different.

Tarrant County App. Dist., 927\nS.W.2d 325, 327 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1996, writ ref'd) (holding, in Supreme Court of Texas\nprecedent, that unambiguous meaning of “or” in statute was the disjunctive). 1 If a liquidated-\ndamages provision may be reasonable based upon either anticipated harm or actual harm caused by\nthe breach, then Advance, as the party with the burden of proving the provision is unenforceable,\nhad to establish unreasonableness under both anticipated harm and actual harm caused by the\nbreach. See Tex. Bus. & Comm.Code Ann. § 2.718(a).\n\nThe majority concludes that the legal standard under Section 2.718(a) is the same as the legal\nstandard under Texas common law and that Advance did not have to show that the liquidated-\ndamages provision was not reasonable in light of the anticipated harm. See ante at pp. 437–40.\nThis conclusion is contrary to the plain meaning of the statutory text, under which the liquidated-\ndamages amount may be reasonable based upon either anticipated harm or actual harm caused by\nthe breach. See id. The majority treats the statutory sentence “[a] term fixing unreasonably large\nliquidated damages is void as a penalty” as equivalent to the following sentence from Phillips's\narticulation of the common law rule: “a liquidated damages provision is unreasonable because\nthe actual damages incurred were much less than the amount contracted for.” See ante at p. 439\n(considering second sentence from Section 2.718(a) as equivalent to this sentence from Phillips\n); Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 2.718(a); Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. In the second sentence\nof Section 2.718(a), the Legislature did not address the legal standard by which courts are to\ndetermine whether a liquidated-damages provision is void as a penalty; that standard is addressed\nin the first sentence of Section 2.718(a). See Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 2.718(a).\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               16\n\fGarden Ridge, L.P. v. Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\nThe majority relies upon the Supreme Court of Texas's decision in Flores v. Millennium Interests,\nLtd. See 185 S.W.3d 427 (Tex.2005). The Flores court addressed the circumstances under which a\nseller of real property under a contract for deed may be liable for the statutory “liquidated damages”\nafforded in Texas Property Code section 5.077(c). See id. at 429–33. In a general discussion of\nthe meaning of the term “liquidated damages,” the Flores court correctly stated that both Texas\ncommon law and Section 2.718(a) recognize a distinction between an enforceable liquidated-\ndamages provision and a void penalty. See id. at 431. The Flores court did not state that the legal\nstandards under Section 2.718(a) and the common law are the same, nor did the Flores court\naddress the legal standard a party must satisfy to show that a liquidated-damages provision is a\npenalty under Section 2.718(a). See id. at 429–33. The Flores case does not support the majority's\nanalysis.\n\nThe majority also relies upon the Supreme Court of Texas's decision in *449 Phillips. See 820\nS.W.2d at 788. The Phillips court addressed the legal standard under Texas common law. See id.\nDetermining the proper legal standard under Section 2.718(a) was not before the Phillips court, and\nthe court did not address this issue. See id. The Phillips court did not state that the legal standards\nunder Section 2.718(a) and the common law are the same. See id. Instead, after reciting the legal\nstandard under Texas common law, the Phillips court cited Section 2.718(a) with a “Cf.” signal,\nindicating that the statute is different from the common law but deals with an analogous subject\nmatter. See id. The Phillips court did not address the difference between the two legal standards,\nand this difference was not necessary to the disposition of that case. See id. The Phillips case does\nnot support the majority's analysis regarding the legal standard under Section 2.718(a).\n\nThe majority further relies upon this court's opinion in Chan v. Montebello Development Company.\nSee No. 14–06–00936–CV, 2008 WL 2986379, at *3–6 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] July 31,\n2008, pet. denied) (mem. op.). The Chan court addressed the legal standard under Texas common\nlaw. See id. Because the determination of the proper legal standard under Section 2.718(a) was not\nbefore the Chan court, the court did not address this issue. See id. Nor did the Chan court state that\nthe legal standards under Section 2.718(a) and the common law are the same. See id. The Chan\ncase does not support the majority's analysis regarding the legal standard under Section 2.718(a).\n\n\n\n                                   An Unwarranted Hindsight Analysis\n\nUnder the legal standard the majority adopts today, parties breaching sale-of-goods contracts\nmay avoid enforcement of liquidated-damages provisions based upon a hindsight analysis. This\napproach not only contravenes the statutory text but also undermines important freedom-of-\ncontract values that are a cornerstone of Texas jurisprudence.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\nTexas has a fundamental public policy in favor of a broad freedom of contract. See Nafta Traders,\nInc. v. Quinn, 339 S.W.3d 84, 95 (Tex.2011) (stating that “[a]s a fundamental matter, Texas\nlaw recognizes and protects a broad freedom of contract”). Liquidated-damages provisions in\ncommercial transactions benefit both sides by providing certainty and predictability. By including\nSection 2–718(a) in Texas's version of the Uniform Commercial Code, the Texas Legislature\nrecognized the utility of liquidated-damages clauses and parties' willingness and desire to choose\nthis remedy in transactions involving the sale of goods. See Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. §\n2.718(a). The Legislature also recognized that in certain situations, liquidated-damages provisions\nshould not be enforceable, and the Legislature crafted a specific legal standard for making this\ndetermination. See id.\n\nWhen a buyer and a seller agree to a liquidated-damages provision, both parties have a potential\nupside and a potential downside. The idea is that, even though the non-breaching party's\nexpectation damages may be far greater than the amount specified in the liquidated-damages\nclause, the non-breaching party's recovery is capped at the amount of specified liquidated\ndamages. Under freedom-of-contract principles, courts must honor the parties' agreement unless\nthe stipulated amount is shown to be unreasonable under Section 2.718(a). See id. Under this\nstandard, as discussed above, the party asserting that the provision is void as a penalty must\nprove that the stipulated amount is unreasonable based both on the harm anticipated at the time of\ncontracting and the actual harm caused by the breach. At the *450 time of contracting, unknown\nfactors often make estimation and calculation of potential damages uncertain. 2 This uncertainty\nat the time of contracting is often what makes the determination of liquidated damages difficult.\nHindsight has a way of making estimations that were reasonable at the time seem unreasonable\nafter a breach. By the time a breach has occurred and the dispute has come to court, the costs and\nvaluations are often easier to estimate and, with hindsight, honest estimates made at the inception\nof the contract might prove to be too high or too low. This is part of the risk of doing business that\nparties embrace when agreeing to a liquidated-damages provision. In evaluating these provisions,\ncourts should not lose sight of important principles of freedom of contract and must uphold the\nsanctity of contract unless the liquidated-damages provision is shown to be a penalty under the\nstandard articulated by the Legislature in Section 2.718(a). See id.\n\nWith the legal standard adopted by the majority today, the court fails to honor the Legislature's\nintent of providing leeway for the parties to have stipulated to an amount of liquidated damages\nthat was reasonable under conditions prevailing at the time of contracting but that ends up not\nmeasuring damages in a completely accurate manner in a particular case. Enforcing liquidated-\ndamages provisions when they accurately gauge actual damages and not enforcing them when\nthey do not deprives the non-breaching party of the remedy it bargained to receive, contrary to\nSection 2.718(a).

With today's opinion\nfrom this court, there are now three different and conflicting views on this question from the three\nintermediate appellate courts that have addressed this issue. Compare ante at pp. 437–40, with\nTXU Portfolio Management Co. v. FPL Energy, LLC, 328 S.W.3d 580, 587–88 (Tex.App.-Dallas\n2010, pet. granted), and with McFadden, 790 S.W.2d at 737–38. The Supreme Court of Texas\nhas granted review in a case in which this issue has been presented. See Petition for Review, FPL\nEnergy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Management Co., No. 11–0050 (Tex. granted Feb. 17, 2012). If this\nissue is not addressed in the Supreme Court of Texas's opinion in the FPL Energy case, uniformity\nand predictability in the application of Section 2.718(a) would be served by high-court review of\nthis issue in this case or another.\n\n\n\n                                                             Conclusion\n\nThe majority's interpretation of Section 2.718(a) is more restrictive than the legal standard\nprovided by the Legislature under the plain meaning of that statute. But, because no error asserted\nby Garden Ridge probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment or probably prevented\nGarden Ridge from properly presenting this case on appeal, the trial court's judgment should be\naffirmed. Accordingly, *451 though I respectfully decline to join the majority opinion, I concur\nin the court's judgment.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    See App. A.\n\n2    Under the UCC, a buyer can reject, accept, or partially accept nonconforming goods. TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.601 (West\n       2009). The buyer must pay at the contract rate for goods it accepts. Id. § 2.607(a). A buyer who notifies the seller of his intention\n       to do so may deduct damages resulting from any breach of the contract from any part of the price still due under that contract. Id. §\n       2.717. Garden Ridge does not dispute that it accepted the snowmen, and there is no evidence that its actions fall within section 2.717.\n3      Advance further contends that prior material breach never can be asserted in any UCC case that concerns nonconforming goods. See\n       Glenn Thurman, Inc. v. Moore Constr., Inc., 942 S.W.2d 768, 771–72 (Tex.App.-Tyler 1997, no writ). However, we need not decide\n       this issue to finally dispose of this appeal. See TEX.R.APP. P. 47.1.\n4      Advance further argues that the chargeback provisions are unenforceable on their face, as in Phillips. However, while Advance was\n       able to prove that Garden Ridge suffered no actual damages here, perhaps there may exist circumstances whereby the nature of the\n       unauthorized substitution, short or incomplete order, mismarked carton, or other noncompliance issue leading to a merchant-initiated\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Advance Intern., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 432 (2013)\n80 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 548\n\n       chargeback would not result in actual damages of zero and whereby the chargeback amounts when compared to those actual damages\n       would not be disproportionate.\n5      Advance argues that Garden Ridge failed to preserve this particular complaint about the allegedly ex ante nature of the liquidated-\n       damages determination. Garden Ridge specifically objected to the inclusion of this particular instruction. The context of the charge\n       conference also reveals that although Garden Ridge requested and the trial court allowed an instruction paraphrasing the first sentence\n       of section 2.718(a) to indicate when liquidated damages were reasonable, Garden Ridge did not agree to the trial court's inclusion\n       of the instruction addressing reasonableness with regard to “actual damages” because that particular instruction, in contrast with the\n       previous instruction Garden Ridge requested and the court allowed, did not reflect a “legally permissible” basis for the jury to award\n       damages to Advance. Thus, Garden Ridge sufficiently made the trial court aware of its complaint that its actual incurred damages\n       should not be included in any reasonableness assessment by the jury of whether the chargebacks constituted penalties, and the trial\n       court overruled Garden Ridge's complaint. See Thota v. Young, 366 S.W.3d 678, 689 (Tex.2012) (“[T]he procedural requirements\n       for determining whether a party has preserved error in the jury charge are explained by one basic test: ‘whether the party made the\n       trial court aware of the complaint, timely and plainly, and obtained a ruling.’ ” (quoting State Dep't. of Highways v. Payne, 838\n       S.W.2d 235, 241 (Tex.1992))).\n6      The trial court also improperly submitted the previous instruction, which Garden Ridge requested and which essentially tracks the\n       first sentence of section 2.718:\n             Parties may agree in a contract to damages payable upon a breach if that contractual amount is reasonable in light of the\n             anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of\n             otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.\n          See TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a). We note that this instruction also properly references “actual harm” as a\n          component of the reasonableness test.\n7      Garden Ridge insists that we must presume harm pursuant to Harris County v. Smith, 96 S.W.3d 230 (Tex.2002), and Crown Life Ins.\n       Co. v. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d 378 (Tex.2000). The Texas Supreme Court, however, has refused to extend the presumed-harm scenario to\n       instruction error. See Thota, 366 S.W.3d at 692–93 (concluding that “even assuming the new and independent cause instruction in this\n       charge constituted error, it does not raise a Casteel issue”); Urista, 211 S.W.3d at 756–57 (declining to extend Casteel's presumed-\n       harm analysis to trial court's submission of an erroneous unavoidable-accident instruction).\n8      Section 2.606(a) provides:\n             (a) Acceptance of goods occurs when the buyer\n             (1) after a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods signifies to the seller that the goods are conforming or that he will take\n             or retain them in spite of their nonconformity; or\n             (2) fails to make an effective rejection (Subsection (a) of Section 2.602), but such acceptance does not occur until the buyer has\n             had a reasonable opportunity to inspect them; or\n             (3) does any act inconsistent with the seller's ownership; but if such act is wrongful as against the seller it is an acceptance\n             only if ratified by him.\n          TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.606(a).\n9      “The buyer must pay at the contract rate for any goods accepted.” TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.607(a).\n\n1      In cases decided after June 14, 1927, the Supreme Court of Texas's notation of “writ refused” or “petition refused” denotes that the\n       court of appeals's opinion is the same as a precedent of the Supreme Court of Texas. See Yancy v. United Surgical Partners Int'l.,\n       Inc., 236 S.W.3d 778, 786 n. 6 (Tex.2007).\n2      A retail merchant that advertises its products in mass media has a distinct need for the seller to provide conforming goods because\n       the retail merchant must be able to furnish conforming goods to the public. Patrons who see an advertisement and come to the retail\n       merchant's store reasonably may expect to be able to purchase the item advertised. Garden Ridge testified that when the product is\n       not as advertised, the merchant suffers loss of customer goodwill. It may often be difficult to estimate the amount of damages from\n       the loss of goodwill and patronage accompanying the breach of a seller who fails to deliver conforming goods the retail merchant\n       had advertised.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                           © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Because we conclude the trial judge correctly interpreted the three\nwritten contracts governing the parties' relationship, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\n                                             I. BACKGROUND\n\nBaylor provides health care services to individual patients. Many of Baylor's patients are members\nof health plans. Baylor has many contracts with health benefit entities, including insurance\ncompanies and preferred provider organizations (PPOs), through which individual patients gain\naccess to Baylor's hospitals and services at discounted rates.\n\nPrivate Healthcare Systems, Inc. (PHCS) operates a network of PPOs. PHCS enters into contracts\nknown as preferred provider agreements with health care providers (such as Baylor) to negotiate\ndiscounts from the providers' full charges for health care services. PHCS also enters into contracts\nknown as subscriber services agreements with insurance companies, employer health plans,\nmanaged care organizations, and third-party administrators, to provide them and their members\naccess to health care services at the discounted rates established by the preferred provider\nagreements.\n\nGPA is a third-party administrator; its customers are self-funded health plans. Third-party\nadministrators provide claims handling services and administrative support to health plans. By\ncontracting with various PPO networks, such as PHCS, GPA also offers its customers—and their\nmembers—access to medical services from a network of providers (e.g. Baylor) at discounted\nrates.\n\nBaylor sued GPA for failure to pay for health care services Baylor provided to members of certain\nhealth care plans administered by GPA. GPA in turn filed a third-party action against PHCS.\nBoth Baylor and GPA moved for summary judgment; Baylor in fact filed several motions for\npartial summary judgment. The trial judge granted Baylor's motions and denied GPA's motion.\nThe parties then entered into an agreed final judgment and severance, by which GPA's third-\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\nparty claims against PHCS were severed into a separate cause, and final judgment was entered for\nBaylor. GPA appeals the judgment in favor of Baylor. PHCS is not a party to this appeal.\n\n\n\n                                      II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n [1] [2] The standards for reviewing summary judgments are well-established, *471 and we\nfollow them in reviewing this appeal. See Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548–\n49 (Tex.1985) (summary judgment standards of review). When both parties move for summary\njudgment, each party bears the burden of establishing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law. City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News, 22 S.W.3d 351, 356 (Tex.2000). When the trial\ncourt grants one motion and denies the other, we review the summary judgment evidence presented\nby both parties and determine all questions presented. Id. The reviewing court should render the\njudgment that the trial court should have rendered or reverse and remand if neither party has met\nits summary judgment burden. Id.\n\n [3] [4] If a defendant moves for summary judgment on an affirmative defense, it must\nconclusively establish each essential element of the affirmative defense. Selz v. Friendly Chevrolet,\nLtd., 152 S.W.3d 833, 836 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005, no pet.) (“To prevail on summary judgment,\na defendant as movant must either disprove at least one element of each of the plaintiff's theories\nof recovery or plead and conclusively establish each essential element of an affirmative defense,\nthereby rebutting the plaintiff's cause of action.”). Similarly, if a party seeks to avoid summary\njudgment by way of an affirmative defense, it must come forward with summary judgment\nevidence sufficient to raise a fact issue on each element of its affirmative defense. See Brownlee v.\nBrownlee, 665 S.W.2d 111, 112 (Tex.1984). Whether a contractual provision is an unenforceable\npenalty and not a liquidated damage clause is an affirmative defense. See TEX.R. CIV.

DISCUSSION\n\nA. The Contracts\nBaylor relies on three written contracts to establish its claim against GPA. First, Baylor\nrelies on a Subscriber Services Agreement between PHCS and GPA dated April 17, 1998,\namended by an Amendment, *472 Assignment, and Assumption of the Subscriber Services\nAgreement with effective dates of September 1, 2002 and January 1, 2003. Under the Subscriber\nServices Agreement, GPA 2 became a subscriber to PHCS's “comprehensive medical management\nsystem.” 3 As a subscriber to PHCS's network, GPA could offer its customers access to PHCS's\nnetwork of medical care providers at the discount rates negotiated by PHCS.\n\nSecond, Baylor relies on a Hospital Services Agreement (HSA) between Baylor and PHCS dated\nJanuary 1, 2002. Under the HSA, Baylor became a “Preferred Provider” in PHCS's network. It\nagreed to provide—at discounted rates 4 —health care services (“Covered Services”) to persons\n(“Members”) covered by “Health Plans” (including PPOs) created or sponsored by a “Payor” (a\ndefined term in the HSA). As part of the HSA, PHCS warranted that its contracts with each Payor\nobligate the “Payor (or its designee) to comply with the duties and obligations of [the HSA],\nincluding, but not limited to, paying for Covered Services rendered to Members in accordance\nwith the provisions of Article IV of [the HSA].”\n\nThird, Baylor relies on a Subscriber Acknowledgment between GPA and PHCS effective January\n1, 2003. The Subscriber Acknowledgment refers to both the Subscriber Services Agreement and\nthe HSA, reciting that GPA and PHCS have entered into the Subscriber Services Agreement and\nthat PHCS has entered into contracts with health care providers for participation in its network. The\nSubscriber Acknowledgment requires GPA “to pay or arrange to pay PHCS Preferred Providers\n[which would include Baylor] in accordance with the PHCS Preferred Provider Agreement for\nsuch Preferred Provider, for the markets and the networks for which [GPA] has purchased provider\nnetwork Services from PHCS.” (First brackets added.)\n\n\nB. Is GPA a “Payor”?\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    4\n\fGPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\nIn its first issue, GPA contends the trial court erred in granting Baylor's motion for summary\njudgment because GPA is not a “payor” under the HSA. At the outset, GPA makes a procedural\nargument that summary judgment was improper because Baylor did not move for summary\njudgment on this issue. We disagree.\n\n *473 Baylor filed four motions for partial summary judgment. In its first motion, Baylor requested\nthat the trial court interpret the three contracts at issue and “find, as a matter of law, that GPA is\nbound by the terms and conditions of the HSA with respect to the health care claims at issue in this\ncase, including the requirements of Section 4.4(a).” In its own motion for summary judgment, GPA\nargued, “GPA is not a ‘Payor’ obligated to pay under the terms of the Baylor/PHCS Agreement,”\nand Baylor filed a summary judgment response again arguing that GPA was bound by the terms\nof the agreement.\n\n [11] The trial court granted Baylor's motion and denied GPA's, necessarily deciding that GPA\nwas a “Payor” bound by the provisions of the HSA, including section 4.4(a). We reject GPA's\nargument that the issue was not presented to and decided by the trial court.\n\nTurning to GPA's substantive argument, GPA asserts the HSA defines “Payor” very narrowly.\nIt argues the evidence established that GPA's clients—and not itself—were “Payors” under the\nHSA. It contends that as a third party administrator, it did not actually pay claims but only offered\nadministrative services to facilitate payment of claims by the employer-funded health plans that\nwere GPA's clients. Because the HSA's payment provisions apply only to “Payors” and GPA is\nnot a Payor, GPA contends it is not responsible to pay for Baylor's services, and thus that the trial\ncourt erred in entering summary judgment in favor of Baylor.\n\nThe HSA defines a “Payor” as\n\n            an insurance company, employer health plans, Taft–Hartley fund, plan sponsors\n            or other similarly situated entities or organizations which are obligated (directly\n            or through its designee) to pay for Covered Services for Members in accordance\n            with such Health Plans.\n\nGPA offered the affidavits of Kathy Enochs, the chief operating officer of GPA, and Madalyn\nStraughn, the vice president of operations for GPA, to establish that GPA is not an insurance\ncompany, employer health plan, Taft–Hartley fund, or plan sponsor. Enochs also testified that\nGPA was not a “payor” under the definition in the contract.\n\nGPA does not dispute it is a party to the Subscriber Services Agreement and the Subscriber\nAcknowledgment. In fact, Enochs testified GPA could not access PHCS's preferred providers at\na discount without the Subscriber Services Agreement and the Subscriber Acknowledgment. She\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    5\n\fGPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\ntestified GPA entered into the agreement with PHCS “to market their network to our plans that\nwe administer.”\n\nIn Exhibit J to the Subscriber Services Agreement, under “Duties of the Subscriber,” paragraph\n2(b) provides, “The Subscriber [i.e. GPA] shall abide by the terms of any agreement with a\nParticipating Provider [e.g. Baylor] entered into by PHCS on behalf of the Subscriber with regard\nto the provision of PPO services.” (Brackets added.) In the Subscriber Acknowledgment, GPA\n“agrees to pay or arrange to pay PHCS Preferred Providers in accordance with the PHCS Preferred\nProvider Agreement for each such Preferred provider, for the markets and the networks for which\nSubscriber has purchased provider network Services from PHCS.”\n\nThe discounts offered to GPA's customers were the result of the relationships among the parties\nto all three agreements. If PHCS did not contract with Baylor under the HSA, there would be no\ndiscount to PHCS's subscribers on the fees for Baylor's services. If GPA did not in turn contract\nwith PHCS to take advantage of the discounts offered in the HSA, those *474 discounts would\nnot have been available to GPA's customers.\n\n [12] In Baylor University Medical Center v. Epoch Group, L.C., 340 F.Supp.2d 749, 755\n(N.D.Tex.2004), similar contracts were held to “constitute a single, unified contract” requiring\na claims supervisor to timely pay Baylor's clean claims. While we are not bound by a decision\nof a federal district court, we may consider federal precedent when it is well-reasoned and\nhelpful. See Davenport v. Garcia, 834 S.W.2d 4, 20 (Tex.1992) (“With a strongly independent\nstate judiciary, Texas should borrow from well-reasoned and persuasive federal procedural and\nsubstantive precedent when this is deemed helpful, but should never feel compelled to parrot the\nfederal judiciary.”).\n\nAs here, there were three contracts in Epoch Group: a HSA between PHCS and Baylor, a\nsubscriber services agreement between PHCS and Epoch, and a payor acknowledgment between\nPHCS and Epoch. Epoch Group, 340 F.Supp.2d at 752. Discussing its conclusion that the three\ndocuments constituted a single, unified contract, the court reasoned:\n\n            Indeed, all three instruments were required to complete the relationship between\n            the parties. The Subscriber Services Agreement, which provided discounts from\n            PHCS to Payors, could not operate effectively without PHCS contracting with\n            providers through hospital services agreements. The very foundation of the\n            discounts offered in [the] Subscriber Services Agreement appears to be the\n            agreements between PHCS and providers such as Baylor. Moreover, Payor\n            Acknowledgments serve no apparent purpose other than to commit Payors to\n            comply with the terms and conditions of the provider agreements.\n\nId. at 755 (citation omitted).\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               6\n\fGPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\n\nGPA distinguishes Epoch Group, arguing the court did not decide the question whether Epoch\nwas a “payor” under the HSA. Perhaps because Epoch signed a document called “payor\nacknowledgment” instead of “subscriber acknowledgment,” the issue whether Epoch was a\n“payor” for purposes of the agreements was not presented to the Epoch Group court. Regardless\nof the titles of the two agreements, however, their substance was the same: to commit the payor or\nsubscriber “to comply with the terms and conditions of the provider agreements,” so that provider\ndiscounts set forth in hospital services agreements could be extended to the subscriber's customers.\nSee id. at 755.\n\n [13] We conclude, as did the trial court, that GPA is bound by the HSA. Reading the three\nagreements together, GPA committed to abide by the terms of the HSA and to pay or arrange to\npay Baylor in accordance with the HSA. Even though the summary judgment evidence showed\nthat GPA was not an “insurance company, employer health plan[ ], Taft–Hartley fund, [or] plan\nsponsor[ ],” we conclude the evidence (i.e. the three contracts) proves as a matter of law that\nGPA falls within the contractual definition of “other similarly situated entities or organizations\nwhich are obligated (directly or through its designee) to pay for Covered Services for Members in\naccordance with such Health Plans.” We overrule GPA's first issue.\n\n\nB. “Liquidated Damages” or “Penalty”?\nThe HSA also contains terms regarding payment of claims:\n\n  4.4 Claim Processing\n\n  (a) Payor (or its designee) shall pay all Clean Claims for Covered Services *475 within forty-\n     five (45) calendar days of receipt of a Clean Claim containing the information set out in\n     Section 4.3 from Hospital in accordance with the applicable reimbursement rates attached on\n     Schedule 1. ... If Payor (directly or through its designee) does not pay within forty-five (45)\n     days of receipt of a Clean Claim, Payor shall no longer be eligible for the rates set forth on\n     Schedule 1 and shall be obligated to pay Hospital at Hospital's Normal Billed Charges and\n     hospital may elect to terminate this Agreement....\n\nIn its second issue, GPA contends the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary\njudgment because the amount of damages awarded against it under this provision constituted an\nunenforceable liquidated damages penalty.\n\nGPA complains that the above section, by requiring payors to pay the hospital's “Normal Billed\nCharges” unless the payor pays a Clean Claim within 45 days, “fixes compensation for breach in\nadvance of the breach,” and is thus an impermissible penalty.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  7\n\fGPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\n [14] [15] “The term ‘liquidated damages' ordinarily refers to an acceptable measure of damages\nthat parties stipulate in advance will be assessed in the event of a contract breach.” Flores v.\nMillennium Interests, Ltd., 185 S.W.3d 427, 431 (Tex.2005); see also Valence Operating Co.\nv. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 664 (Tex.2005) (“[l]iquidated damages clauses fix in advance the\ncompensation to a party accruing from the failure to perform specified contractual obligations”).\nWhether a contract term is a liquidated damages clause is a question of law for the court. Valence\nOperating Co., 164 S.W.3d at 664.\n\n [16] [17] If a court determines that a contract term is a liquidated damages clause, the court may\nthen determine whether the clause is enforceable, or whether it is an unenforceable penalty. The\npolicy underlying the prohibition against penalties is to ensure that a party to a contract receives\n“just compensation,” that is, “neither more nor less than his actual damages.” Phillips, 820 S.W.2d\nat 788 (quoting Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484, 485–86 (1952)). In order to\nenforce a liquidated damages provision and determine the provision is not a penalty, “the court\nmust find: (1) that the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2)\nthat the amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.”\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788 (quoting Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers, Inc. v. Campesi, 592\nS.W.2d 340, 342 n. 2 (Tex.1979)).\n\nBaylor argues that section 4.4 is neither a liquidated damages provision nor a penalty. Baylor\nasserts that section 4.4 “does not fix in advance compensation for GPA's failure to perform,”\nbut rather “provides a two-tiered pricing structure that grants GPA discounts (often substantial)\nif claims are paid within forty-five days.” Baylor further contends that even if section 4.4 is a\nliquidated damages provision, it is enforceable under Texas law and is not a penalty because\ndamages are difficult or impossible to estimate, and Baylor's normal billed charge is a reasonable\nforecast of just compensation.\n\nFor purposes of this opinion, we will assume without deciding that section 4.4(a) of the HSA is\na liquidated damages provision, and examine whether the clause is also an unenforceable penalty\nunder the factors set forth in Phillips.\n\n [18] [19] The party asserting that a liquidated damages clause is an unenforceable penalty (here,\nGPA) bears the burden of proof. Urban Television Network Corp. *476 v. Liquidity Solutions,\nL.P., 277 S.W.3d 917, 919 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2009, no pet.) (citing Murphy v. Cintas Corp., 923\nS.W.2d 663, 665–66 (Tex.App.-Tyler 1996, writ denied)). GPA moved for summary judgment\non the issue whether section 4.4(a) of the HSA is an unenforceable penalty. To obtain summary\njudgment on the affirmative defense of penalty, GPA must prove each element of the defense. See\nBrownlee, 665 S.W.2d at 112; Selz, 152 S.W.3d at 836; see also Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 789. GPA\nargues the payment of “Normal Billed Charges” is not a reasonable forecast of just compensation,\nand the harm caused by late payment is not incapable or difficult of estimation. See Phillips, 820\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                8\n\fGPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\nS.W.2d at 788. In support of its motion for summary judgment, GPA offered evidence comparing\nthe discounted rates to the hospital's normal billed rates for the charges at issue. GPA offered a\nchart attached to the affidavit of Madalyn Straughn that showed the percentage difference between\nthe discounted rate and the normal billed charge for each of the charges at issue. GPA notes “the\noverwhelming majority of the percentage charges are 33% or more.”\n\nIn response to GPA's motion for summary judgment, Baylor offered evidence regarding the\ndifficulty of estimation and the reasonableness of the charges. Baylor offered the affidavit of Janda\nEdwards to explain that Baylor's normal billed charge “is the amount Baylor charges for services\nand supplies to entities or individuals who do not have access to a discount through a contract with\nBaylor.” Edwards explained Baylor's normal billed charge “is established by each facility and is\nbased upon an analysis of many factors including the service provided, the amount of personnel\ntime needed to provide the service, the amount of capital equipment needed to provide the service,\nthe amount of routine equipment needed to provide the service, the overhead, and market value.”\nEdwards also testified that Baylor's normal billed charge is a reasonable amount for the health care\nservices and supplies provided in the charges at issue in this case.\n\n [20] [21] GPA quotes from Edwards's affidavit and argues, “Baylor offered no justification\nattempting to show how the changed billing rate was a reasonable estimate of the cost associated\nwith payments being untimely.” GPA posits that a “more reasonable” calculation would be “a $30\nservice fee and 18% annual interest,” and argues, “our society routinely deals with late payments\nby a modest service fee and interest, and thus Baylor's damages were calculable.” GPA does\nnot offer evidence to support these arguments, however. The difficulty (or lack of difficulty) in\nestimation as well as the unreasonableness of the damages estimate were GPA's to prove. Urban\nTelevision Network Corp., 277 S.W.3d at 919. General statements about a “more reasonable” or\n“modest” rate are not evidence that the harm from late payment is difficult to estimate, or that the\nnormal billed charges were an unreasonable forecast of the loss actually sustained. See Phillips,\n820 S.W.2d at 788. GPA also emphasized that Baylor itself referred to the normal billed charge as\na “penalty.” The substance of the provision controls, however. See Arthur's Garage, Inc. v. Racal–\nChubb Security Systems, Inc., 997 S.W.2d 803, 810 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1999, no pet.) (provision\nentitled “liquidated damages” was actually a limitation of liability provision, so penalty analysis\nwas not appropriate). Because GPA did not meet its burden of establishing that the clause requiring\npayment of normal billed charges after 45 days was an unenforceable penalty, the trial judge did\nnot err in denying GPA's motion for summary judgment on this issue. We overrule GPA's second\nissue.\n\n\n *477 C. Claims arising before 2003\nIn its third issue, GPA argues the trial judge erred by awarding damages for the period of\ntime before GPA signed the Subscriber Acknowledgment Form. While GPA admits signing the\nSubscriber Services Agreement in 1998, it argues that it did not agree to “pay or arrange to pay”\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   9\n\fGPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\nuntil the 2003 amendments set forth in the Subscriber Acknowledgment. Therefore, GPA argues,\nany claims arising in 2002 or before were included improperly in the trial court's judgment.\n\nBaylor counters that GPA's obligations were set forth in the Subscriber Services Agreement,\nincluding the agreement to abide by any agreement between PHCS and a hospital, and those\nobligations did not change in 2003. Because GPA accepted the benefits of the agreements before\n2003, Baylor argues, it must also accept the obligations.\n\n [22] We agree with Baylor that GPA's obligation to abide by the HSA did not change in 2003.\nWhile the “pay or arrange to pay” language does not appear in the Subscriber Services Agreement,\nGPA did agree at that time to abide by the provisions of the HSA, and, as noted in Epoch\nGroup, “the very foundation” of the discounts offered to GPA's customers are “the agreements\nbetween PHCS and providers such as Baylor.” Epoch Group, 340 F.Supp.2d at 755. The Epoch\nGroup court commented that the payor acknowledgments “serve no apparent purpose other than\nto commit Payors to comply with the terms and conditions of the provider agreements.” Id.\nThe contractual relationship among the parties was established when GPA signed the Subscriber\nServices Agreement and began to take advantage of the discounted rates offered under the HSA.\nThe trial court did not err in awarding damages for the period of time before GPA signed the\nSubscriber Acknowledgment. We overrule GPA's third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                         CONCLUSION\n\nWe overrule GPA's issues and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The trial court's judgment recites that the full name of the plaintiff is “Baylor Health Care System, on behalf of Baylor All Saints\n        Medical Center, Baylor Heart and Vascular Hospital, Baylor Specialty Hospital, Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation, Baylor University\n        Medical Center, Baylor Medical Center at Garland, Baylor Regional Medical Center at Grapevine, Baylor Medical Center at Irving,\n        Our Children's House at Baylor, Baylor Regional Medical Center at Plano, and Baylor Medical Center Ellis County.”\n2       The Subscriber Services Agreement was actually between PHCS and a Texas corporation named “Group & Pension Administrators,\n        Inc.” The parties entered into a Rule 11 agreement that “[f]or purposes of this case, G & P Administrators, Inc, and GPA Holding,\n        Inc. agree that they can be treated as one entity for the purpose of discovery and liability.” In accordance with this agreement, in\n        this opinion we will refer only to GPA.\n3       The Subscriber Services Agreement recites its purpose:\n           A.

Plans offered and managed by Subscriber [GPA] provide health benefits and/or services to eligible participants under health\n              benefit plans.\n           C.

Bellos, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2003)\n2003 WL 22411873\n\n *1 The trial court granted a motion for summary judgment filed by Nicholaos C. Bellos, M.D.,\nP.A. and enforced a contractual liquidated damages clause against Healix Infusion Therapy, Inc.\nThe trial court awarded Dr. Bellos $10,000.00 in his suit against Healix. The trial court also\nawarded attorney's fees to Dr. Bellos. In two issues on appeal, Healix argues that the liquidated\ndamages clause is an unenforceable penalty and that there are genuine issues of material fact\nregarding damages. 1 We affirm.\n\nDr. Bellos sued Healix in another lawsuit; the parties reached a settlement in that suit. Both\nparties agreed not to disclose the nature of the settlement agreement. The agreement provided for\n$10,000.00 in liquidated damages in the event of a breach by either party. After the settlement\nagreement was signed, Methodist Hospitals of Dallas (Methodist), where Dr. Bellos practiced,\nsent $6,385.13, which it owed to Dr. Bellos, because it mistakenly believed that Healix held a lien\nagainst Dr. Bellos. Healix sent a letter and a copy of the settlement agreement to Methodist to show\nthat there was no lien. Dr. Bellos claimed that Healix breached the settlement agreement when\nHealix furnished the agreement to Methodist, and he sued Healix to recover under the liquidated\ndamages provision of the agreement.\n\nA trial court must grant a motion for summary judgment if the moving party establishes that no\ngenuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw. TEX.R.CIV.P. 166a(c); Lear Siegler, Inc. v. Perez, 819 S.W.2d 470, 471 (Tex.1991). Once\nthe movant establishes a right to a summary judgment, the non-movant must come forward with\nevidence or law that precludes summary judgment. City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Authority,\n589 S.W.2d 671, 678–79 (Tex.1979). When reviewing a summary judgment, the appellate court\ntakes as true evidence favorable to the non-movant. Every reasonable inference must be indulged\nin favor of the non-movant and any doubts resolved in its favor. American Tobacco Company,\nInc. v. Grinnell, 951 S.W.2d 420, 425 (Tex.1997); Nixon v. Mr. Property Management Company,\nInc., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548–49 (Tex.1985). In order to succeed on an affirmative defense in\na summary judgment proceeding, a defendant must establish every element of the affirmative\ndefense. American Tobacco Company, Inc. v. Grinnell, supra.\n\nCourts will enforce liquidated damages provisions in contracts when the court finds that the harm\nresulting from a breach of the contract is incapable or difficult to estimate and when it also finds\nthat the amount provided as liquidated damages is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.\nRio Grande Valley Sugar Growers, Inc. v. Campesi, 592 S.W.2d 340, 342 n. 2 (Tex.1979). The\n“difficulty of estimation” and “reasonable forecast” questions must be determined from evidence\nof the circumstances which existed at the time the parties executed the agreement. Baker v.\nInternational Record Syndicate, Inc., 812 S.W.2d 53 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1991, no writ). Courts will\nnot enforce liquidated damages clauses which do not meet those criteria because the clauses would\nconstitute unenforceable penalties. Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (Tex.1991).

Bellos, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2003)\n2003 WL 22411873\n\nwhether a liquidated damages clause is enforceable or whether it is an unenforceable penalty is a\nquestion of law. Phillips v. Phillips, supra.\n\n *2 In this case, the initial burden was on the movant. However, when a party raises the affirmative\ndefense of penalty, that party assumes the burden to conclusively establish the defense. Baker v.\nInternational Record Syndicate, Inc., supra.Therefore, the burden was upon Healix to prove that\nthe contractual liquidated damages was an unenforceable penalty.\n\nThe settlement agreement offered as summary judgment evidence by Dr. Bellos showed that the\nparties agreed to keep the nature of the settlement agreement confidential. The parties further\nagreed that a breach of the confidentiality clause would result in imminent and irreparable harm\nand that the damages for a breach of confidentiality would be $10,000.00. Healix admitted in its\nresponse to Dr. Bellos's request for admissions that it agreed to the confidentiality of the agreement\nand that it agreed to the $10,000.00 liquidated damages clause. Dr. Bellos's affidavit reflected that\nhe agreed to the confidential nature of the agreement and that he had performed all acts required of\nhim under the settlement agreement. His affidavit further showed that Methodist subjected him to\na re-credentialing process every two years. He was unaware of how the disclosure of the agreement\nwould affect the re-credentialing process, but states that he has been harmed in a manner that is\n“incapable of or difficult of estimation.”\n\nAs part of its proof, Healix attached the affidavit of Heather Hughes–Glass, the corporate risk\nmanager for Healix. In her affidavit, Heather Hughes–Glass stated that, as soon as she became\naware of the confidentiality provision of the agreement that was sent to Methodist, she contacted\nDean Matthys, the corporate risk manager for Methodist, to have him destroy the agreement. She\nfurther stated that Matthys indicated that only he and his assistant were aware of the settlement\nagreement. Also included in the summary judgment evidence was an affidavit given by Matthys as\nwell as a letter from Matthys to Healix. These documents indicated that the copy of the settlement\nagreement was destroyed soon after it was received by Methodist and that the only two people to\nsee the agreement, Matthys and his assistant Lisa Irby, were not involved with the re-credentialing\nprocess at Methodist. Finally, Healix offered as summary judgment evidence Dr. Bellos's response\nto a request for disclosure that any economic damages suffered by Dr. Bellos were difficult to\nestimate.\n\nThis evidence does not meet the burden Healix must bear: that at the time the agreement was made\ndamages could be easily ascertained and that the amount of the liquidated damages award was not\na reasonable forecast of just compensation. Healix contends that the award of liquidated damages\nis disproportionate to the actual damages suffered by Dr. Bellos because Dr. Bellos did not have\nany actual damages. To emphasize this point, Healix relies on Baker.“If the liquidated damages are\nshown to be disproportionate to the actual damages, then the liquidated damages can be declared a\npenalty and recovery limited to actual damages proven.”Baker v. International Record Syndicate,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   3\n\fHealix Infusion Therapy, Inc. v. Bellos, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2003)\n2003 WL 22411873\n\nInc., supra at 55.Healix still must show that, at the time the agreement was made, the amount of\nthe liquidated damages was not a reasonable forecast. To prove this defense, Healix must prove\nactual damages, if any, to show that the actual loss was not an approximation of the stipulated\nsum.Baker v. International Record Syndicate, Inc., supra.That damages are not yet ascertainable\nis not tantamount to evidence of “zero” damages.\n\n *3 The summary judgment evidence establishes that there was an agreement between Healix and\nDr. Bellos that prohibited the disclosure of the nature of the settlement agreement and that Dr.\nBellos performed all the required acts under the agreement. Healix breached the agreement by\nsending a copy of the agreement to Methodist. Because we find that Healix failed to meet its burden\nof proof on the penalty issue and because Healix failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact,\nwe hold that the trial court did not err when it granted Dr. Bellos's motion for summary judgment.\nHealix's issues on appeal are overruled.\n\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The award of attorney's fees is not contested in this appeal.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Wisenbaker, Chase Avenue Corporation, and Crittendon\nAcquisition Company. They are also joined by Van Oliver, as trustee for trade creditors of Heritage\nResources, Inc., an intervening party. Michael Wisenbaker is the principal of all the corporations\nexcept for Wise Oil Ventures, which is owned by his father. Wisenbaker, a self-described oilman,\nhas been an independent oil and gas venturer since the early 1970s. He was once married to the\ndaughter of Mr. A.G. Hill, Sr. and Mrs. Margaret Hunt Hill. The Appellees are hereafter referred\nto as “Heritage.”\n\nThe Non–Operators, defendants below and Hunt/Hill here, principally consist of two related\nfamilies. The first family was headed by A.G. Hill, Sr., a prominent oil and gas businessman, who\ndied shortly after this litigation began. He was survived by his wife, Margaret Hunt Hill, who\nwas named a defendant, individually and as Executrix and Trustee of her husband's estate. Also\nnamed in the suit were the trusts of the Hills' seven grandchildren and their daughter, Lyda Hill.\nThey comprise, together with two closely held family corporations, Seven Falls Company and U.S.\nFinancial Corporation, what will be referred to as the “Hill Group.” The other family includes the\nbrothers, Sherman and Stuart Hunt, and their closely held corporation, the Kickham Group, Inc.,\nand two Hunt daughters, Hara and Hilre. They are collectively referred to as the “Hunt Group.”\nThe Appellants as a whole will be referred to as “Hunt/Hill.”\n\n\nB. The Dispute.\nIn the early 1980s, Heritage acquired oil and gas leases in several sections of the *102 Crittendon\nField in Winkler County, Texas. Heritage sold substantial, partial interests in these leases to A.G.\nHill, Tribal Drilling (a Hunt family partnership), and the Hunt brothers individually. In November\n1984, Heritage, as the Operator, entered into a Joint Operating Agreement (“22 J.O.A.”) for\nSection 22 of the Crittendon Field with Tribal Drilling Company and A.G. Hill and a number of\nother smaller working interest owners, using A.A.P.L. Form 610–1982 Model Form Operating\nAgreement. The contract area defined by Exhibit “A” of the 22 J.O.A. was for all of Section\n22 “[t]o a depth of 20,000' or to a depth sufficient to thoroughly test the Fusselman formation,\nwhichever is the lesser depth.”\n\nFrom our review of the 14,000 plus page record, we have distilled the facts of the case to the\nfollowing narrative chronology beginning in 1985:\n\n\n1985\n\n         October 23 A Joint Operating Agreement for the adjacent Section 21 was entered\n           into by essentially the same parties as the 22 J.O.A.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n\n1986\n\nAugust Heritage circulated an Authorization for Expenditures “AFE,” which proposed the 22–2\n  well. The AFE requested consent for drilling a new well with an objective depth limitation of the\n  lesser of 22,000 feet or depth sufficient to test the Ellenburger formation (a geological stratum\n  located in the Crittendon Field at an approximate depth of 21,500 to 22,000 feet below the\n  surface and approximately 1000 feet thick). Heritage and all the Non–Operators, except Hunt/\n  Hill, consented to the AFE. For their part, Hunt/Hill agree to a second AFE which provided for a\n  depth limitation of the lesser of 20,000 feet or depth necessary to test the Fusselman formation\n  (a geological stratum located in the Crittendon Field at a depth of approximately 19,300 feet\n  below the surface and approximately 800 feet thick).\n\nNovember 2 The 22–2 well was spudded.\n\nNovember 18 Heritage and the two Hunt brothers entered into a Letter Agreement for 22–2 well\n  and “subsequent” wells which authorizes deeper drilling, in stages, of the 22–2 well beyond\n  20,000 feet, with the Hunts' prior consent.\n\n1987\n\nApril 29 Tribal Drilling Company, Sherman Hunt, Stuart Hunt, and other members of the Hunt\n  Group entered into a letter of agreement stipulating their proportionate shares of the drilling,\n  testing, and completing costs attributable to the proposed 22–2 well and any subsequent wells in\n  Section 22. The letter acknowledged that Sherman and Stuart Hunt agreed to pay 37.5 percent of\n  all costs attributable to the 22–2 well and 18.75 percent of all costs attributable to any subsequent\n  wells drilled in Section 22 pursuant to their letter of agreement with Heritage dated November\n  18, 1986.\n\nMay As drilling on the 22–2 well neared 19,000 feet, the operations became more tenuous. Hunt/\n Hill requested that the 22–2 well's drilling cease and that the well be put into production, but\n Heritage continued the drilling.\n\nMay 10 Heritage and Oxford Oil and Gas, Inc. “Oxford” entered into a letter of agreement whereby\n Oxford agreed to pay 64.5 percent of the drilling costs of the 22–3 well in exchange for an\n assignment of a 33.333334 percent working interest in the 22–3 well. Oxford had the option\n to quit paying at any time and to receive a proportionately reduced interest once the well was\n completed. The agreement was expressly subject to the terms of the 22 J.O.A. (This document\n was dated May 10, 1987. There was some testimony, however, that the letter of agreement was\n not actually executed until September 1987).\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n\nMay 19 The 22–2 well blew out, but drilling operations were restored within several days. A\n meeting of interest owners was held and the Hills and Hunts orally agreed to participate in a\n subsequent well, the 22–3 well, provided that the drilling on the 22–2 well stopped and it was\n put into production.\n\nMay 22 The 22–2 well reached the Silurian formation (a geological stratum located *103 in\n the Crittendon Field at an approximate depth of 18,900 to 19,300 feet below the surface and\n approximately 300 feet thick).\n\nJune 20 The 22–2 well was completed at a depth of 19,062 feet below the surface and placed in\n  production. Production pressure tests indicated a potential Texas record for gas reserves.\n\nJune 30 Heritage issued an AFE proposal for the new or substitute well—the 22–3. The AFE\n  was for a new location and a depth of 22,000 feet or a depth sufficient to test the Ellenburger\n  formation, whichever was less. Hills and Hunts did not respond to the AFE. The Hunts began an\n  analysis of their investment in the Crittendon Field and began negotiations with Lyco Energy\n  Corp. to sell their entire interest in the Crittendon Field.\n\nSeptember 25 The Hunt Brothers secretly recorded a conversation with Michael Wisenbaker. The\n  Hunts told Wisenbaker that: (1) they were not contemplating the sale of their interests in the\n  Crittendon Field; (2) they wanted a Joint Operating Committee to oversee Crittendon Operations\n  with J.R. Latimer as Operator for the committee; (3) they wanted to stop all drilling activities in\n  Section 22; and (4) they had the requisite votes to remove Heritage as Operator and would do so\n  unless Wisenbaker agreed with the Hunts. They were informed that Heritage was in negotiations\n  with Enserch Gas Company and Lone Star Gas Company “Enserch/Lone Star” for prepayment\n  gas contracts, and that Heritage was going forward with the 22–3 well and would not resign\n  as Operator.\n\nSeptember 25 Heritage sent the working interest owners an Ellenburger AFE for the proposed 22–\n  3 well. The AFE proposed a total depth of 22,000' or to a depth sufficient to test the Ellenburger\n  formation whichever was shallower.\n\nSeptember 27 Tribal Drilling notified Heritage that it is opposed to the 22–3 well.\n\nSeptember 28 The Hunts notified Heritage that a “vote” of the Non–Operators had been taken,\n  and that a majority voted to remove Heritage for “failure and/or refusal to carry out its duties\n  as Operator” of Sections 21, 22, and 23, but that there was not a majority voting for removal\n  with respect to the other two wells. The letter stated that Tribal Drilling would take over\n  operations and that Heritage should only perform “routine and necessary production, operating,\n  and maintenance operations” until Tribal Drilling took over. Wisenbaker telephoned Sherman\n  Hunt and told him that Heritage will not resign as the Operator.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Latimer reported large gas reservoir in the Ellenburger formation.\n\nOctober 5 The Hunt brothers sent a letter to Heritage requesting that no further operations be\n  conducted until they sold their interests.\n\nOctober 14 Heritage distributed a second AFE, an Ellenburger AFE for the 22–3 well, to the\n  Hunts, Hills, and to all the other Section 22 working interest owners.\n\nOctober 26 An Operator's meeting was held to discuss the 22–3 well. Heritage confirmed that\n  the proposed 22–3 well's formation objective was the Ellenburger. The Hunts objected to the\n  drilling of the 22–3 well on the basis that Heritage was “selling out” and the working interest\n  owners would not know “who they are going to be in bed with.”\n\nNovember 10 Hill signed an Ellenburger AFE for the 22–3 well, conditioned upon: (1) the 22\n  J.O.A. be amended to 22,000 feet; (2) Hill retain an option of waiting until the well reached\n  the Woodford Shale before deciding to go “consent” to the Ellenburger; (3) costs be billed\n  in accordance with a revised ownership schedule; and (4) all working interest owners received\n  title opinion in time to review prior to spudding the 22–3 well.\n\n      Gregg Ewing of A.G. Hill Oil Producer sent a letter to Heritage. The letter stated that pursuant\n      to the October 26, *104 1987 meeting, A.G. Hill reviewed the AFE dated September 25,\n      1987, for the 22–3 well and determined that the proposed 22–3 well is outside the contract\n      area of the Section 22 J.O.A. Ewing advised Heritage that the J.O.A. must be amended to\n      cover the 22–3 well and that A.G. Hill's execution of the AFE was subject to Heritage's\n      agreement to amend the Section 22 J.O.A.\n\nNovember 23 Heritage furnished the Hunts with an executed depth-limited assignment.\n\nNovember 30 The Hunts signed a sale agreement with Lyco for the sale of Tribal Drilling's interest\n  in the Crittendon Fields for $20 million and part of future production.\n\nNovember 25 The Hunts then directed their attorneys to contact Heritage and advise it that since the\n  contract area for the 22 J.O.A. was 20,000 feet, or a depth sufficient to test the Fusselman, the\n  objective depth of the proposed 22–3 well was outside the contract area. Attorneys for the Hunts\n  sent Heritage a letter stating: (1) the 22–3 well is a proposed operation outside the “contract\n  area” of the J.O.A.; (2) the J.O.A. does not govern operations outside the “contract area;” (3)\n  the Hunts demand a full and complete accounting for all costs and revenues attributable to the\n  22–3 well; (4) Heritage and the Hunts are tenants-in-common as to the 22–3 well; and (5) if it\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(i.e. within the “contract area”),\n   the Hunts will elect to be either “consent” or “non-consent” at that time.\n\nDecember The Hunts then hired Newton Ballou to audit Heritage's books and operations from\n  1985 through 1987. The auditor concluded that Heritage was in good to excellent condition and\n  that out of $4 million in expenses, only $8,000 had been improperly coded.\n\nDecember 1 Heritage sent a third AFE for the 22–3 well with an objective depth of 20,000 feet,\n  or a depth sufficient to test the Fusselman formation, whichever was the lesser depth.\n\nDecember 2 Sherman Hunt and Virgil St. Clair, Exploration and Development Manager for A.G.\n  Hill, met to discuss how the Hills could help in stopping the drilling of the 22–3 well.\n\nDecember 8 Hunts' lawyer sent a letter to Heritage demanding an assignment of interest from\n  Heritage under all of Section 22 from the surface down to 19,164 feet below the surface. The\n  letter further stated that the Hunts rejected the proposed assignment of interest that Heritage\n  delivered on November 23, 1987.\n\nDecember 9 Mike Wisenbaker met with A.G. Hill, Jr. at the latter's offices. Hill advised\n  Wisenbaker that if he attempted to drill the 22–3 well, that Hunt/Hill would claim that Heritage\n  was a bad faith trespasser and seize all gas production should the well be successful. Mike\n  Wisenbaker alleged that Hill warned that Heritage would be “squashed ... like a bug” if he did\n  not accept a new Operator.\n\nDecember 10 Virgil St. Clair sent Heritage a letter on behalf of the Hills stating that they had\n  “discovered that Heritage does not have a working interest” in Section 22, which is a deemed\n  resignation of operatorship under the terms of the 22 J.O.A. The letter further stated that Hill\n  was nominating Tribal Drilling to assume operatorship and they would poll the other working-\n  interest owners. The letter was a collaborative effort between the Hunts and Hills.\n\nDecember 15 Virgil St. Clair, on behalf of A.G. Hill, sent a letter to Heritage stating that Tribal\n  Drilling received a majority of the working interest vote to operate the 22–2 well.\n\nDecember 16 Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's memo indicated that Hunt/Hill advised Anadarko\n  Petroleum Corporation that Heritage did not have an interest in the Crittendon Field. The memo\n  referenced a letter from A.G. Hill that stated it was unnecessary for Anadarko to respond to\n  the 22–3 well AFE because the 22–3 well was outside the Section 22 J.O.A.'s parameters and\n  Heritage “has *105 no revenue interest, which is interpreted to read that it has no economic\n  interest ... therefore, no interest” [emphasis added] in Section 22.\n\nDecember 17 Virgil St. Clair, on behalf of A.G. Hill sent Heritage a reply to Heritage's December\n  17 letter stating that although Heritage Resources, Inc. was record title owner, a Supplemental\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n   Division Order Title Opinion showed that Heritage Resources, Inc. did not have actual\n   ownership.\n\nDecember 18 Hunt/Hill published a letter, on behalf of Tribal Drilling and all working interest\n  owners claiming that Heritage was a bad faith trespasser on Section 22. Tribal Drilling filed suit\n  against Heritage in state court in Dallas, County. Tribal Drilling sought a declaratory judgment\n  that Heritage had no interest in the field and a temporary restraining order to cease Heritage's\n  operations and turn them over to Tribal Drilling. Three hours later Heritage filed this instant\n  suit in Winkler County alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2) slander of title; (3) cloud on title;\n  (4) tortious interference with contract; (5) tortious interference with business relations; and (6)\n  intentional/negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n\nDecember 18 Wisenbaker and Wisenbaker Production Company transferred their interests in\n  Section 22 to Heritage.\n\nDecember 23 Hunt lawyers sent a letter to Heritage lodging objections to 22–3 well.\n\nDecember 28 Heritage began drilling the 22–3 well.\n\n1988\n\nJanuary 29 Hunt lawyers sent a letter to Heritage that they had opinion that the 22–2 well had been\n  drilled to depth sufficient to test the Fusselman formation. The letter demanded that Heritage\n  assign all deep rights under the letter agreement to the Hunt Group.\n\nMarch 21 Heritage notified the Non–Operators by letter that it was going to market the non-consent\n interests to the 22–3 well. Immediately, the Non–Operators protest the sale of the non-consent\n interests. Attorneys for A.G. Hill, U.S. Financial, and Lydia Hill sent a letter to all working\n interest owners advising of the Dallas litigation seeking to obtain a declaratory judgment that\n Heritage had been removed as Operator and detailing the alleged improprieties by Heritage\n in continuing operations to drill the 22–3 well. The letter further stated the consent or non-\n consent requirements of the 22 J.O.A. were not applicable because of Heritage's status of title,\n and opined that Heritage's actions in drilling the 22–3 well put Heritage in either a cotenancy\n or bad faith trespass.\n\nApril 8 Heritage sent a letter to Jack Bestrom and Jerry Anderson notifying them that Best Energy\n  Corporation, Insured Energy Production, Inc., and Oxford owed Heritage $1,072,211.05 as\n  their proportionate share of the drilling operations for the 22–3 well. More than $200,000 of\n  this amount was over 90 days past due. Oxford's share of the total amount due was $702,390.\n  Heritage suspended revenue to all three companies until the balance due was paid.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n\nMay 17 Heritage filed a second suit in Winkler County seeking damages and declarations that it\n was the rightful Operator.\n\n      Heritage sent a letter to the “consenting” working interest owners regarding the “Non–\n      Consent Interests.” Heritage takes the position that those parties who have failed to respond\n      to Heritage's proposal to drill the 22–3 well, most notably the Hunt and Hill Groups, are now\n      “Non–Consent Interests” and that Heritage has the right under the J.O.A. to market these\n      “Non–Consent Interests.” Heritage asserted that these interests were “Non–Consent” since\n      March 20, 1988.\n\nMay 26 Heritage and Best Energy Corporation (Jack Bestrom) entered into a contract for the sale\n and purchase of a portion of the non-consent interests. Best Energy Corporation contracted\n to purchase 28 percent of the working interest to the 22–3 well. The estimated drilling costs\n attributable to this working interest were $2,000,000. The sale was *106 made subject to the\n successful removal of the cloud on Best's acquired title. The cloud was the claim by Hunt/Hill\n that there were no non-consent interests to market.\n\nAugust 25 Oxford made its last payment of costs for the 22–3 well in the first week of August.\n  At approximately this time, Oxford decided that it would no longer pay for any of the drilling\n  costs of the 22–3 well that are attributable to the non-consent interests that were marketed by\n  Heritage. Oxford also ceased any attempts to sell a portion of the non-consent interests.\n\nAugust Heritage informed Jerry Anderson, president of Oxford, and Oxford that it believed\n  Oxford's conduct was fraudulent. Heritage informed Anderson that Heritage would have no\n  further business involvements with Oxford.\n\nNovember 2 J.D. Ochsner, the District Manager of the Western Division of the Gas Purchases\n  Department of Lone Star Gas Co., sent a letter to the president and vice-president of Lone\n  Star Gas Co. seeking approval for revisions to the proposed prepayment gas purchase contracts\n  between Enserch/Lone Star and Heritage.\n\nDecember 6 J.D. Ochsner sent Heritage a letter confirming the status of ongoing negotiations\n  between Heritage and Enserch/Lone Star. Enserch/Lone Star forwarded revised prepayment\n  gas purchase contracts to Heritage's New York counsel for review. Enserch Gas Co. also sent\n  Heritage's counsel proposed loan agreements between Wise Oil Ventures and Enserch Gas Co.\n\nDecember 7 Ochsner sent the president of Lone Star Gas Co. a memo stating that Heritage hopes\n  to be able to sign the prepayment gas purchase agreements within two to four working days.\n\n1989\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The 22–2 well\n began coning or producing water in large quantities; gas production was significantly reduced.\n\nMarch 13 Heritage informs Sun that the 22–2 well began to produce significant amounts of water.\n Sun withdrew its offer to purchase Heritage's interests.\n\nJuly 14 Heritage sent a letter to the Hunt brothers stating that the Hunts failed to earn any interests\n  in Section 22. Heritage stated that the Hunts were required to pay 37.5 percent of all costs for the\n  22–2 well and 18.75 percent of all costs on subsequent wells in Section 22. Heritage alleged that\n  the Hunts failure to pay 18.75 percent of the costs for the 22–3 well caused the Hunt's purported\n  interests in Section 22 to revert to Heritage. Heritage offered to reinstate the Hunts' interests if\n  the Hunts tendered payment for 18.75 percent of the costs associated with the 22–3 well.\n\nAugust 4 Heritage filed Plaintiff's First Supplemental Original Petition seeking recovery of the\n  22–2 well revenues previously paid to the Hunts on the grounds that the Hunts failed to meet the\n  required conditions to earn the 3/16ths interest in Section 22 under the terms of the November\n  1986 letter of agreement.\n\nDecember 20 Dan Ryser, executive vice-president of Enron Gasbank “Enron,” sent Heritage a\n  Letter of Intent. The letter expressed the parties' intent to enter into good faith negotiations for\n  Enron's purchase of interests from the Heritage group. Enron and Heritage expressed an intent\n  to close negotiations and enter into an agreement by January 15, 1990.\n\n1990\n\n         January 24 Steve Wisenbaker notified Bank One that Enron was unable to complete\n           the transaction with Heritage. After six months of negotiations, the parties\n           scheduled a closing date for the purchase of Heritage's interests. However, prior\n           to the closing date, the president of Enron was terminated. Enron notified *107\n           Heritage that it would be unable to proceed with the closing schedule.\n\n1992\n\n         May 1 Heritage filed its First Amended Petition alleging that Hunt/Hill: (1)\n          breached their obligations under the J.O.A. by both refusing to participate in the\n          22–3 well and refusing to go “non-consent;” (2) wrongfully received production\n          payments from the 22–2 well that were contingent upon participation in the 22–\n          3 well; (3) conspired to wrongfully remove Heritage as Operator of Sections\n          21, 22, and 23; (4) breached their obligations under the J.O.A. by attempting to\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Hills' motivation is less clear, though it seems more focused\non their concerns with the conduct of field operations by Heritage. Nonetheless, the essential\nfacts of this case are largely undisputed and relatively uncomplicated. These facts, however, are\nenveloped within the mass and maze of a record typical of oil and gas cases, and groaning further\nfrom the Byzantine nature of joint operating agreements. Not surprisingly, the author has spent\nmany months wandering in strange and mostly wrong valleys searching for the answers to the\nimponderables presented in this case.\n\nBasically, this is a case where the Joint Operating Agreement Operator has alleged commercial\nand tort causes of action arising as a consequence of the actions of Non–Operators in attempting\nto remove him as the Operator and to prevent subsequent well operations. These causes of action\ninclude tortious interference, slander of title, and fraud. On the other side, the Hunt/Hill's claim\nthat Heritage breached the Joint Operating Agreement (“J.O.A.”) and was not legally qualified to\nserve as the Operator under the J.O.A. The jury generally found for Heritage and rejected all of\nHunt/Hill's claims.\n\nHeritage, recovered under three theories of tort liability: (1) tortious interference with contract\nand business relationship; (2) slander of title; and (3) fraud. Each of these causes of action were\npremised upon essentially six distinct actions alleged and proven. These were:\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hunt/Hill also claim that Heritage did not submit breach of contract\nto the jury; however, we immediately disagree with that claim. In response to jury Question 8, the\njury found that the 22–3 well was covered by the 22 J.O.A. Further, in response to jury Question\n11, the jury found that Hunt/Hill's failure to comply with the 22 J.O.A. was not excused. Thus,\nwe find that jury implicitly found that Hunt/Hill breached the 22 J.O.A. This finding does not,\nhowever, extinguish Hunt/Hill's complaint.\n\n [2] [3] Hunt/Hill has broadly argued that Heritage's claims only sound in contract and not in\ntort. On the other side of this looking glass, Heritage counters just as broadly that this is simply\na tort case. Justice Larsen has noted that the “law of ‘contorts' is a muddy area, devoid of bright\nline rules or easy answers as to what conduct constitutes a tort, and what a breach of contract. The\nacts of a party may breach duties in tort or contract alone, or simultaneously in both.” Airborne\nFreight Corp., Inc. v. C.R. Lee Enterprises, Inc., 847 S.W.2d 289, 293 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1992,\nwrit denied).

Under such circumstances, in\naddition to the exemplary damages awardable because of the tort claim, *109 attorney's fees are\nrecoverable because of the breach of contract claim.\n\n\nA. Standard of Review\nThe legal issue presented by these points of error, the theory of recovery or defense, involve\nseveral rulings by the trial court: overruling objections to questions in the jury charge; and\nmotions for a directed verdict; to disregard jury findings; for judgment n.o.v.; and for new\ntrial. These are all predicated upon a question of law reviewable by this Court de novo.\nPhillips Pipeline Co. v. Richardson, 680 S.W.2d 43, 48 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1984, no writ)(jury\nquestions); State Nat'l Bank of El Paso v. Farah Mfg. Co., Inc., 678 S.W.2d 661, 669 (Tex.App.\n—El Paso 1984, writ dism'd by agr.) (directed verdicts); Best v. Ryan Auto Group, Inc., 786\nS.W.2d 670, 671 (Tex.1990)(judgment n.o.v.); Kraus v.

Ordinarily, we review the record in the light most\nfavorable to the findings, considering only the evidence and reasonable inferences that support\nthe finding and rejecting all evidence and inferences contrary to the finding. Schaefer v. Texas\nEmployers' Ins. Ass'n, 612 S.W.2d 199, 201 (Tex.1980); Best, 786 S.W.2d at 671. Here, however,\nthe issue is presented and considered as a pure question of law reserving the evidentiary factors\nnecessary to sustain or dismiss the legal theory under the sufficiency evidence points which are\nconsidered below. Thus presented, the scope of our review is truly plenary and includes the entire\nnon-evidentiary portion of the record. We consider therefore the causes of actions pleaded and\nthe contract to determine as a question of law whether Heritage's claim sounds only in contract\nand not tort.\n\n\nB. Heritage's Business Tort Causes of Action (“Contorts”).\n\n1. Tortious Interference with a Contract or Prospective Business Relationship.\n [4] Texas law protects existing and prospective contracts from interference. Juliette Fowler\nHomes, Inc. v. Welch Assocs., Inc., 793 S.W.2d 660, 665 (Tex.1990). The principal difference\nbetween the two involves the requirement of a contract as opposed to a potential for a contract and\nthe question of justification or defense which is borne by the defendant in a tortious interference\nwith contract case. To recover for tortious interference with an existing contract, a plaintiff must\nprove: (1) the existence of a contract subject to interference; (2) a willful and intentional act of\ninterference; (3) that the act was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's damage; and (4) that actual\ndamage or loss occurred. Holloway v. Skinner, 898 S.W.2d 793, 795–96 (Tex.1995); Juliette\nFowler Homes, 793 S.W.2d at 664; Armendariz v. Mora, 553 S.W.2d 400, 404 (Tex.Civ.App.—\nEl Paso 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                14\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n [5] [6] [7] To establish a cause of action for a prospective business relationship, the plaintiff\nmust show: (1) the reasonable probability that a contractual relationship would have been entered;\n(2) an intentional, malicious intervention with the formation of that relationship; (3) without\nprivilege or justification; and (4) resulting in actual damage or loss.

The Contract—The Joint Operating Agreement.\nThis case features the 1982 version of the operating agreement form promulgated by the American\nAssociation of Petroleum Landmen (“A.A.P.L. Form 610–Model Form Operating Agreement\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 15\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n1982”). The basic and stated purpose of these operating agreements is for the exploration and\ndevelopment of designated oil and gas within the prescribed geographical area described in Exhibit\n“A” to the J.O.A. A single party is appointed “operator” who is responsible for the management\nand control of drilling, development, and production activities. The parties agree to share the costs\nand liabilities, to own equipment, and to share in production in proportion to their respective\npercentage of ownership and burdens, which is also set out in Exhibit “A” of the J.O.A.\n\nThe drilling of an initial well on the contract area is the only operation mandated in which all\nthe parties must participate. After the initial well, any party may propose subsequent drilling\noperations, but such operations must be conducted by mutual consent of all the parties or pursuant\nto the consent/non-consent provisions. A.A.P.L. Form 610, 1982, Art. VI, B. Notice of a proposal\ntriggers the consent/non-consent provisions for subsequent drilling operations. Those parties who\ndecline to participate are “non-consenting parties.” Those who agree to participate are consenting\nand bear all costs and risks of that operation. A consenting party may opt to limit its participation\nto its original working interest or to “carry its proportionate part of Non–Consenting Parties'\ninterests....”\n\nWhen the operations begin, the non-consenting parties are deemed to have relinquished all interest\nin the well, operating rights, and production until the carrying parties are reimbursed for 100\npercent of what would have been the non-consenting party's share of the operating costs and\nsurface equipment and a substantial risk penalty, a multiple (500 percent in this case) of most other\ncosts carried. A.A.P.L. Form 610, 1982, Art. VI, B(2).\n\nTypically, any party desiring to drill a subsequent well or to rework, deepen, or plug back a\nnonproducing well is required to give written notice to each participant, specifying the operation\nproposed, the location, objective depth and formation, and the estimated cost. Upon receipt of the\nnotice, the election to participate must be exercised within a specified period of time. The failure\nto respond is deemed a negative election. A.A.P.L. Form 610, 1982, Art. VI, B(1).\n\nAn election to participate applies to the full extent of a party's interest. However, a party may\nincrease its participation by assuming responsibility for a non-consenting party's interest. If less\nthan all parties elect to participate, the proposing party must inform all the consenting parties of\nthe total *111 interest committed to the project. Each party that elects to participate may then\nfurther elect to limit its participation to its original interest or to carry its proportionate part of\nthe non-consenting parties' interests in addition to its original interest. Despite a non-consenting\nparty's relinquishment of control and share in the subsequent operation, the non-consenting party\nremains a party in the overall venture and continues to have a substantial degree of control even\nover the project in which it is not participating. The non-consent party retains the right of access\nto all portions of the contract area. Most significant to this case, the non-consent party continues\nto have voting rights in the removal and appointment of the operator, which provides a forum for\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nvoicing complaints on the nature of operations for any well in the contract area. Voting rights are\nundiluted by a non-consent position.\n\n\nD. Independent Causes of Action.\nHunt/Hill contends that Heritage's claims are totally dependent upon the Joint Operating\nAgreements entered into by the parties for operations in the Crittendon Field. Focusing on the\nsource of duty and the type of damages claimed and proven, Hunt/Hill argues that without the 22\nJ.O.A. and its attendant relationships, interests, and obligations, no tort obligations rise, and that all\nof Heritage's claims sound only in contract. They cite Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. DeLanney, 809\nS.W.2d 493, 495 (Tex.1991), arguing that because the injuries claimed by Heritage are economic\nlosses premised solely upon the subject of the 22 J.O.A., Heritage's action sounds in contract alone.\nId., quoting Jim Walter Homes, Inc. v. Reed, 711 S.W.2d 617, 618 (Tex.1986).\n\n [11] The gist of this issue is really that many of the same operative facts that can give rise to a\ncause of action for breach of contract may also give rise to causes of action for business torts. While\nthe concept that contractual obligations arise from an agreement between the parties whereas a\ntort obligation is imposed by law separate from any contractual undertaking seems quite evident,\napplication of the concept is not so clear cut. Compare Airborne Freight Corp., Inc., 847 S.W.2d at\n295–96, with Beneficial Personnel Servs. of Texas, Inc. v. Rey, 927 S.W.2d 157, 167–68 (Tex.App.\n—El Paso 1996)(vacated pursuant to settlement without reference to the merits). Minimally, any\nanalysis must consider the source of the duty and the nature of the remedy sought to determine\nthe independence of tort claims from their associated contract claims. See Formosa Plastics Corp.\nUSA v. Presidio Eng'rs and Contractors, Inc., 41 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 289, 291, 960 S.W.2d 41, 43\n(Tex.1998). Most significant to this case, however, is that the Texas Supreme Court has clearly\nrecognized the propriety of fraud and tortious interference with contract claims notwithstanding\nthe fact that damages were only economic losses recoverable under a breach of contract claim. Id.\nat 293, at 44 citing Crim Truck & Tractor Co. v. Navistar Int'l Transp. Corp., 823 S.W.2d 591,\n597 (Tex.1992) and American Nat'l Petroleum Co. v. Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp., 798 S.W.2d\n274, 278 (Tex.1990).\n\n\nE. Conclusion.\n [12] Thus, the question before us simply comes down to whether Heritage's tort claims are\nsufficiently independent from the breach of contract claims in the pleadings, in the proof, and in\nthe damages questions submitted to the jury.\n\nThe tortious interference and slander of title claims relate to:\n\n   • the non-consent interests which Heritage claims it derived from Hunt/Hill's non-participation\n      in the 22–3 well and which Heritage sought to sell to third parties;\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     17\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n\n   • a buy-in agreement that Heritage had with Oxford;\n\n   • gas purchase agreements which Heritage sought with Enron and Enserch/Lone Star; and\n\n   • a proposal by Sun to buy all of Heritage's interest in the Crittendon Field.\n\nThe fraud cause of action depends on the allegation that:\n\n   • the Hunts orally promised Heritage that the Hunts would pay for their share of the drilling\n      of the 22–3 well, as well as substitute or subsequent well operations, *112 in exchange for\n      Heritage putting the 22–2 well into production.\n\nWhile it is clear that the right to remove an operator under a J.O.A., and participation or non-\nparticipation in a subsequent J.O.A. operation are undoubtedly contractual rights, it does not\nnecessarily follow that a party's actions regarding the J.O.A. contract can never rise to the level of\na tort. See American Nat'l Petroleum Co., 798 S.W.2d at 278 (breach of one's own contract, while\nonly giving rise to contract claims as regards to that contract, can also constitute claim in tort for\ntortious interference with the contract of a third party). As noted above, the Texas Supreme Court\nrecently reaffirmed, at least conceptually, that concept, holding that “tort damages are recoverable\nfor a fraudulent inducement claim irrespective of whether the fraudulent representations are later\nsubsumed in a contract or whether the plaintiff only suffers an economic loss related to the subject\nmatter of the contract.” Formosa Plastics Corp. USA, 41 Tex.Sup.Ct.J. at 293, 960 S.W.2d at 44.\n\nFurthermore, we are not dealing with an ordinary contract. Joint Operating Agreements,\nstandardized forms developed over years by the industry to govern ventures in the development of\noil and gas properties, are simply not everyday fixtures of life. They govern operations involving\nimmense financial risk and reward; the parties to J.O.A. are experienced and sophisticated and\ngenerally have balanced bargaining positions. These are agreements which involve liabilities and\nobligations unique to the legal and technical peculiarities of the oil and gas industry. Nevertheless,\nthis case highlights that they are still basic structures with minimal safeguards and protections\nfrom the misconduct of a party.\n\nWe conclude the pleadings and jury submissions sufficiently distinguish independent claims of\nbreach of contract and tort causes of action. The specific facts forming the basis for breach of\ncontract establish at least some degree of independence from the facts forming the basis for the\ntortious interference, slander of title, and fraud. The tort causes of action pled and proven by\nHeritage were independent of the 22 J.O.A. Rather, the contracts or business relationships alleged\nby Heritage relate to the non-consent interests Heritage sought to sell to third parties, the gas\npurchase agreements, and Heritage's attempt to sell its entire Crittendon interests which are clearly\nindependent of the obligations and duties imposed under the 22 J.O.A. Consequently, we find that\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 18\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nHeritage's recovery in tort is not barred as a matter of law. Points of Error 1a, 5a, 9a, 13a, 17a,\n23a, 27a, 31a, 35a, 39a and 53a are overruled.\n\n\n\n                                                         IV.\n\n\n                                            Non–Consent Interests.\n\n\n                       Points of Error 1b, c, 2a, 4, 22, 23b, c, d, e, f, 24a, and 44.\n\nWe next consider whether there were non-consent interests. Heritage alleged that Hunt/Hill were\nnon-consenting parties to the drilling of the 22–3 well and that they tortiously prevented Heritage\nfrom marketing the non-consent interests of Hunt/Hill that Heritage carried in accordance with\nthe 22 J.O.A. Hunt/Hill counter that there were no non-consent interests to be carried by Heritage\nbecause the 22 J.O.A. did not cover the 22–3 well. We find that the 22 J.O.A. did not cover the\n22–3 well.\n\n\nA. Standard of Review.\nNone of the parties argue that the terms of their joint operating agreement are ambiguous; they\nsimply disagree over the construction and interpretations of its terms. A disagreement over the\nmeaning of a contract does not render the provision ambiguous. Purvis Oil Corp. v. Hillin and\nMS Oil Properties, Inc., 890 S.W.2d 931, 935 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1994, no writ); First City Nat'l\nBank of Midland v. Concord Oil Co., 808 S.W.2d 133, 136 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1991, no writ).\nWhen parties disagree over the meaning of an unambiguous contract, the court must determine\nthe parties' intent from the agreement itself, not from the parties' present interpretation. Purvis Oil\nCorp., 890 S.W.2d at 935; KMI Continental Offshore Prod. Co. v. ACF Petroleum Co., 746 S.W.2d\n238, 241 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ denied). Where a contract is unambiguous,\n *113 it need only be enforced as a matter of law and as it is written. Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d\n391, 393–94 (Tex.1983); R & P Enters. v. LaGuarta, Gavrel & Kirk, Inc., 596 S.W.2d 517, 518–\n19 (Tex.1980).\n\nAs we discussed before, and as we will discuss several more times, Joint Operating Agreements\nare familiar, standardized legal documents developed by the oil and gas industry to conduct the\ncomplex and risky business of drilling and producing oil and gas. Basic to the purpose of the\nJ.O.A. is the identification of what oil and gas properties are subject to the J.O.A. and what the\nproportional obligations and interests are borne by the respective working interest owners in the\ndevelopment of those properties, both of which are detailed in Exhibit “A” to the J.O.A. These are\nessential to a J.O.A. because participation in the first well is the only operation in which all the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  19\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nJ.O.A. parties must participate, and thereafter, any J.O.A. party may propose subsequent drilling\noperations which must be conducted by mutual consent of all the parties or pursuant to the consent/\nnon-consent provisions. A.A.P.L. Form 610, 1982, Art. VI, B.\n\nHeritage claims that it properly proposed the development of the 22–3 well under the terms of the\n22 J.O.A., and because Hunt/Hill elected not to participate in the 22–3 well operation, Heritage\ncarried the 22–3 well non-consenting interests of Hunt/Hill. In Question 8 of the trial court's\ncharge, the jury found that the 22–3 well was covered by the 22 J.O.A. It is, however, clear from\nthe record and undisputed that the 22–3 well was proposed, engineered, and drilled to a target\ndepth of 22,000 feet or the Ellenburger formation. Thus, the first problem with the jury's verdict\nis that the 22 J.O.A. on its face does not cover the 22–3 well. Exhibit “A” of the 22 J.O.A. reads,\nin pertinent part:\n\n   1. LANDS SUBJECT TO THIS AGREEMENT:\n\n      All of Section 22, Block C–23, PSL Survey, Winkler County, Texas\n\n   2. RESTRICTIONS AS TO DEPTHS OR FORMATIONS:\n\n      To a depth of 20,000' or to a depth sufficient to thoroughly test the Fusselman formation,\n      whichever is the lesser depth.\n\nIn the face of this contradiction, Heritage makes two alternative arguments. First, that whether or\nnot the J.O.A. covers a well is determined at the time the well is proposed and not after the well has\nalready been drilled. Secondly, the J.O.A. parties modified the depth restrictions of the 22 J.O.A.\nto cover the deeper depths to which they actually drilled the 22–3 well.\n\n [13] We find their first argument that the actual depth or formation to which a well is drilled is\nimmaterial so long as the depth and formation initially proposed were within the “contract area,”\nunpersuasive, either as a general proposition or as applied to this case. The argument is especially\nflawed as for drilling operations that go beyond or deeper than the limitations defined by the J.O.A.\nIt also trivializes the import of the defined contract area and subjects the non-operators to the whim\nof the operator. Cf. Hamilton v. Texas Oil & Gas Corp., 648 S.W.2d 316, 323–24 (Tex.App.—\nEl Paso 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Conversely, it makes almost no sense to require or to allow an\noperator to drill deeper than is necessary to bring a well into proper production. In other words,\nthe depth and formation expressed in the J.O.A. define the outer or maximum boundaries covered\nby a J.O.A. and not minimum mandatory objectives. We therefore reject Heritage's first argument.\n\n [14] [15] It is axiomatic that a J.O.A. contract and specifically the contract areas may be\ncontractually amended, and Heritage's alternative argument is that the 22 J.O.A. was modified\nto authorize drilling the 22–3 well to the actual completion depth of 22,000 feet. To conclude\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 20\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nthat there was a valid modification, the jury had to favorably determine two elements. The first\nis that the modification is based upon new consideration. Hovas v. O'Brien, 654 S.W.2d 801, 803\n(Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Barnhill v. Moore, 630 S.W.2d 817, 820\n(Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1982, no writ). The second is that there existed the same degree of\nmutuality and meeting of the minds as was present for the original contract. Mid Plains Reeves,\nInc. v. Farmland Indus., *114 Inc., 768 S.W.2d 318, 321 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1989, writ denied);\nMandril v. Kasishke, 620 S.W.2d 238, 244 (Tex.Civ.App.—Amarillo 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.). One\nparty alone cannot modify a contract after it has been entered into and all parties to the agreement\nmust assent to the modification for the modification to be valid. Mandril, 620 S.W.2d at 244.\n\nThe 22 J.O.A. was entered into by sixteen entities, besides Heritage. Accordingly, any\nmodification of the contract would require the mutual assent of all the parties. It is clear from\nthe record that the parties contemplated a modification of the contract area. Indeed, the attempted\nmodification of the 22 J.O.A. contract area did not begin with the 22–3 well, but rather with the 22–\n2 well. Consequently, we must consider two instances in order to decide if there was, as Heritage\nargues, a valid modification to the 22 J.O.A. to extend the contract area deeper: (1) the issuance and\nexecution of AFEs on the 22–2 well; and (2) the issuance and execution of AFEs on the 22–3 well.\n\n\n1. The 22–2 Well.\n [16] The undisputed evidence shows that all the working interest owners, except the Hills and\nTribal Drilling Company, signed an Ellenburger AFE for the 22–2 well. This contemplated and\nauthorized drilling beyond 20,000 feet and the shallower Fusselman formation. The undisputed\nevidence shows, however, that the Ellenburger AFE was accompanied by a cover letter from\nHeritage to the working interest owners that stated, that despite the language in the AFE, Heritage\nonly intended to drill to a depth sufficient to test the Fusselman formation, or to 20,000 feet,\nwhichever was less. Hunt/Hill objected and demanded a Fusselman AFE for the 22–2 well.\n\nConsequently, as a matter of law, a modification of the 22 J.O.A. could not have occurred via the\n22–2 well Ellenburger AFE. As evidenced by Heritage's cover letter, there is legally no evidence\nof a meeting of the minds between Heritage and the other working interest owners. Moreover,\nthere is no evidence of a clear intent on behalf of the parties to modify the J.O.A. Indeed, formal\nmodification of the 22 J.O.A. was never expressly addressed or requested. Finally, because of the\nconflicting language of the accompanying cover letter, we do not find any intent by implication\nthat the signing of the Ellenburger AFE by the working interest owners would modify the 22 J.O.A.\n\nThe Hunts and Tribal Drilling's refusal to sign an Ellenburger AFE for the 22–2 well, and their\ndemand for and execution of a Fusselman AFE clearly negates any finding of a modification of\nthe 22 J.O.A. because of the 22–2 well operations.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 21\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n\n2. The 22–3 Well.\n [17] On May 19, 1987, Heritage encountered problems in the drilling of the 22–2 well. Heritage\nalleged that it halted drilling on the 22–2 well, which was well short of the target depth in exchange\nfor Hunt/Hill's oral promise to pay their share of the costs for a substitute well, the 22–3 well.\nBoth Heritage and Hunt/Hill understood that the 22–3 well was to be drilled to a depth of 22,000\nfeet, or a depth sufficient to test the Ellenburger formation. No part of that agreement was ever\nput into writing and no evidence was offered of the essential terms of the agreement. Once it\nhad the oral agreement with Hunt/Hill to stop drilling on the 22–2 well, Heritage polled the other\ninterest owners to secure unanimous consent of all working interest owners to stop short the drilling\noperations on the 22–2 well.\n\nHeritage then issued three AFEs in series for the 22–3 well. The first AFE issued on June 30,\n1987, proposed drilling to a depth of 22,000 feet. The second AFE issued on October 14, 1987,\nproposed a different location and a depth of 22,000 feet. The third AFE issued on December 1,\n1987, proposed the same location as the June AFE but proposed drilling only to a depth of 20,000\nfeet.\n\nHeritage has not cited, and we have not found any evidence that any one of these AFEs was\nexecuted by all the working interest owners. There is evidence that the Hills, in a letter to Heritage,\nconditionally agreed to the drilling of the 22–3 well to a depth of 22,000 feet upon the occurrence\nof several conditions, two of which included that Heritage *115 formally amend the 22 J.O.A.\nto cover the proposed drilling depth and that Heritage secure a title opinion on the drill site in\naccordance with the 22 J.O.A. The evidence reflects that Heritage tried but failed to secure the\nother Non–Operators' consent to amend the Section 22 J.O.A. to eliminate the depth restrictions.\nWe simply fail to see how Heritage can now hold Hunt/Hill liable under the unmodified contract.\nCentex Corp. v. Dalton, 840 S.W.2d 952, 956 (Tex.1992); Tubb v. Bartlett, 862 S.W.2d 740, 746\n(Tex.App.—El Paso 1993, writ denied).\n\nHeritage has failed to present sufficient evidence of a meeting of the minds of all parties to the\nSection 22 J.O.A. sufficient to effect a modification. We find that as a matter of law, the Section 22\nJ.O.A. did not cover the 22–3 well. This finding requires that we sustain Points of Error 22 and 44.\n\n\nB. Claims Based on Non–Consent Sales.\n\n1. Tortious Interference with a Contract/Prospective Business Relationship.\n [18] Because the 22 J.O.A. did not govern the 22–3 well, there was no obligation by any of\nthe working interest owners to make a consent or non-consent election when the 22–3 well was\nproposed by Heritage. Consequently, there were no non-consent interests in the 22–3 well for\nHeritage to carry or be able to sell. Nonetheless, the jury found that Heritage had both an agreement\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  22\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nto sell the non-consent interest to the five different third parties and a reasonable probability of\nmaking such an agreement. These findings are unsupportable.\n\nThe cause of action for tortious interference with a contract is qualified with the requirement that\nthe contract be “subject to interference.” Juliette Fowler Homes Inc., 793 S.W.2d at 664. All\ncontracts are not subject to interference. There must at least be a “valid” contract. Id. Unsupported\nby any valuable consideration, i.e., the non-consent interests, these contracts were void and not\nsimply unenforceable. Armendariz v. Mora, 553 S.W.2d 400, 404–05 (Tex.Civ.App.—El Paso\n1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\n [19] Similarly, an element of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship is\nthat there is a reasonable probability of entering into a business relationship. Since Heritage had\nno non-consent interests to sell, there was “no interest with which [Hunt/Hill] could tortiously\ninterfere.” Grace v. Zimmerman, 853 S.W.2d 92, 96 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1993, no\nwrit). With nothing to sale, there could be no actual damages.\n\n [20] [21] [22] We also note the general rule that an interfering party is justified in his or her\ninterference if the interference is done in a bona fide exercise of his or her own rights and if he\nor she has an equal or superior right in the subject matter to that of the other party. Victoria Bank\n& Trust Co. v. Brady, 811 S.W.2d 931, 939 (Tex.1991). Justified action includes the filing of a\nlawsuit, as long as it is done in good faith with the belief that there is a colorable claim. Texas Beef\nCattle Co. v. Green, 921 S.W.2d 203, 211 (Tex.1996); Tidal Western Oil Corp. v. Shackelford, 297\nS.W. 279, 280–81 (Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1927, writ ref'd). The courts have also recognized\nthe privilege that an interfering party can act to protect its own legitimate financial interest; the\ninvalid selling of non-existing interests pursuant to a joint operating agreement is certainly such\nan adequate financial interest. Central Sav. and Loan Ass'n v. Stemmons Northwest Bank, 848\nS.W.2d 232, 241 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1992, no writ). Such justification would apply to both causes\nof action—actual and prospective agreements.\n\nWe thus find that all claims of tortious interference with contract or with prospective business\nrelationships regarding the non-consent interests Heritage claimed to be carrying must fail as a\nmatter of law. Points of Errors 1b, c, 2a, and 4 are sustained.\n\n\n2. Slander of Title.\n [23] Slander of title is a tort action with stringent pleading and proof requirements. The plaintiff\nmust prove that the defendant made a false and malicious statement, disparaging property in which\nthe plaintiff holds an interest, and causing special damages. *116 Clark v. Lewis, 684 S.W.2d 161,\n163 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1984, no writ). A plaintiff must also prove the loss of a specific\nsale in order to recover. A.H. Belo Corp. v. Sanders, 632 S.W.2d 145, 145–46 (Tex.1982).\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                23\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n [24] Since there were no non-consent interests for Heritage to carry or sell, Heritage could not\npossess any interest or estate which could be disparaged; Hunt/Hill's publications or utterances\ncomplaining about Heritage's attempts to sell or otherwise market those interests were not false;\nand finally, it is impossible for Heritage to prove the loss of a specific sale or any special damage.\nAll of Heritage's claims for slander of title premised on the non-consent sales must fail as a\nmatter of law. Heritage is, therefore, precluded from recovery on any theory involving non-consent\ninterests in the transactions involving: (1) Craig Sandahl; (2) Jack Bestrom; (3) Bruce Heafitz; (4)\nMobil Producing; and (5) E.R. Duke. We sustain Points of Error 23b, c, d, e, f, and 24a.\n\n\n\n                                                         V.\n\n\n                                             Statute of Limitations.\n\n\n                          Points of Error 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 25, 29, 33, 37, and 41.\n\n [25] Hunt/Hill challenge the award of damages based on tortious interference with contract and\nprospective business relations and slander of title on the ground that all such claims were barred\nby the statutes of limitations. Actions based upon tortious interference with an existing contract,\ntortious interference with business relations, and slander of title are all controlled by a two-year\nstatute of limitations.

KPMG Peat Marwick, 856 S.W.2d 742, 746 n. 4 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1993, writ denied).\nThe determination of when a cause of action accrues is a question of law. Willis v.

Atkins v. Crosland, 417\nS.W.2d 150, 153 (Tex.1967). Similarly, a cause of action for tortious interference with business\nrelations does not accrue until existing negotiations, which are reasonably certain of resulting in a\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Tectonic Realty Inv. Co. v. CNA\nLloyd's of Texas Ins. Co., 812 S.W.2d 647, 654 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1991, writ denied). If the\nplaintiff is not yet harmed, even in the face of a breach of duty, then the cause of action has\nnot yet accrued and any suit filed thereupon is premature. Philips v. Giles, 620 S.W.2d 750,\n751 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas 1981, no writ). Moreover, if a claim is not yet ripe, a trial court has\nno jurisdiction to render an opinion thereon. City of Garland v. Louton, 691 S.W.2d 603, 605\n(Tex.1985). To the extent that a plaintiff seeks relief based upon facts that have not yet occurred,\nthere is no live controversy between the parties and a trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction\nover such claims. State Bar of Texas v. Gomez, 891 S.W.2d 243, 245 (Tex.1994); *117 Jones\nv. Westergren, 771 S.W.2d 669, 671 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1989, no writ). Consequently, if\nthe trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the appellate court can make no order other than\nto reverse the case and dismiss. Gomez, 891 S.W.2d at 244; City of Garland, 691 S.W.2d at 605.\n\nHeritage's Original Petition was filed on December 18, 1987, and joined as defendants, A.G. Hill,\nVirgil St. Clair, Lyda Hill, Tribal Drilling Company, Stuart Hunt, Sherman Hunt, The Kickham\nGroup, Inc., Hara Hunt, Hilre Hunt, and U.S. Financial Corporation. The original petition alleged\nvarious breaches of the J.O.A., interference with actual and prospective business relationships, and\ncloud of title. The petition contained a brief statement of facts pertaining to Hunt/Hill's challenge\nof Heritage's status as Operator under the Section 22 J.O.A. and how those actions constituted a\nbreach of the 22 J.O.A. Heritage filed its First Amended Petition on May 1, 1992, adding a number\nof new plaintiffs and new defendants. At trial in 1992, Heritage presented evidence in support of\nits claims for tortious interference, slander of title, breach or impaired contract, and lost sales.\n\nIn jury Questions 23, 27, 34, and 39, the jury found that Heritage's negotiations with various\nindividuals for the sale of the alleged non-consent interests in the 22–3 well and Heritage's\nnegotiations with Oxford, Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron did not end before April 30, 1990\n(the date two-years prior to the filing of the First Amended Petition), and that Heritage's claims\nfor tortious interference and slander of title based upon the non-consent, Oxford, Sun, Enserch/\nLone Star, and Enron transactions were not barred by the statute of limitations period for these\ncauses of action. Hunt/Hill challenge this finding as being legally insufficient as a matter of law\nand factually insufficient as being against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.\n\n\nA. Standard of Review\nWhen attacking the legal sufficiency of an adverse jury finding to an issue on which the appellant\nhad the burden of proof, the appellant must demonstrate that all vital facts were conclusively\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This Court\nemploys a two-prong test when reviewing a “matter of law” challenge on an adverse jury finding.\nChandler, 842 S.W.2d at 832. First, the record is examined for evidence which supports the finding\nwhile ignoring all evidence to the contrary. Chandler, 842 S.W.2d at 832; Sterner, 767 S.W.2d at\n690; Holley, 629 S.W.2d at 696; Montes, 779 S.W.2d at 487. If there is no evidence to support the\nfinding, we then examine the whole record to determine if the contrary position is established as\na matter of law. Chandler, 842 S.W.2d at 832; Sterner, 767 S.W.2d at 690; Holley, 629 S.W.2d at\n696–97; Montes, 779 S.W.2d at 487. Only if the contrary position is conclusively established will\nthe point of error be sustained. Chandler, 842 S.W.2d at 832; Meyerland Community Improvement\nAss'n v. Temple, 700 S.W.2d 263, 267 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\nWhen attacking the factual sufficiency of the failure of the fact finder to find an issue on which\nthe appellant had the burden of proof, it must demonstrate on appeal that the failure to find is so\nclearly against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust. This\nstandard requires us to first consider whether there is some evidence that supports the failure to\nfind the issue, and then determine, in light of the entire record, whether the failure to find the issue\nis manifestly unjust. Croucher v. Croucher, 660 S.W.2d 55, 58 (Tex.1983); Robert W. Calvert,\n“No Evidence” and “Insufficient Evidence Points of Error ”, 38 Texas L.Rev. 361, 364–68 (1960).\n\n\nB. Transactions.\n\n1. Non–Consent Interests.\n [31] Hunt/Hill complain that the evidence shows that Heritage did not attempt to sell *118 the\nnon-consent interests in the 22–3 well until May 1988 and that the efforts to sell those interests\nhad failed by June 1988. Since these claims were not specifically asserted until Heritage filed its\nFirst Amended Petition on May 1, 1992, Hunt/Hill argue that they are barred by limitations. We\nfind, however, that Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code § 16.068 governs the application of\nthe statute of limitations in situations such as this. It provides:\n\n            If a filed pleading relates to a cause of action, cross action, counterclaim, or\n            defense that is not subject to a plea of limitation when the pleading is filed,\n            a subsequent amendment or supplement to the pleading that changes the facts\n            or grounds of liability or defense is not subject to a plea of limitation unless\n            the amendment or supplement is wholly based on a new, distinct, or different\n            transaction or occurrence. TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 16.068\n            (Vernon 1997).\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   26\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n\nHeritage's original petition complained of the original defendants' conduct in challenging\nHeritage's working interest in the 22 J.O.A. and sought damages for breach of contract, intentional\ninterference with business relations, and interference with arrangements to promote interests in\nthe 22–3 well. When an amended pleading sets up a new cause of action under Section 16.068, it\nwill relate back to the date of the original pleading for the purposes of limitations, so long as the\namended pleading does not allege a wholly new, distinct, or different transaction. Ex parte Goad,\n690 S.W.2d 894, 896–97 (Tex.1985); Duran v. Furr's Supermarkets, Inc., 921 S.W.2d 778, 791\n(Tex.App.—El Paso 1996, writ denied). The amended claim simply does not allege a wholly new,\ndistinct, or different transaction. Both the earlier and later claims involve the 22 J.O.A. and the\nparties to that operating agreement. Non-consent interests are an integral feature of Joint Operating\nAgreements, and critical to this point, they are the core of this litigation.\n\nConsequently, even though Heritage's attempts to sell the non-consent interests may have occurred\nafter the filing of the original petition, the causes of action involving those interests do not arise\nfrom a wholly different transaction separate and apart from the originally pled breach of contract\naction. Heritage's first amended petition relates back to its original petition. Finding some evidence\nto support the jury's finding that the non-consent transactions were not barred by the statute of\nlimitations, we reject the legal sufficiency complaint. We also find that the great weight of the\nevidence does not support a finding that the complaint involving non-consent interest is barred by\nlimitations. Accordingly, we overrule both portions of Points of Error 3 and 25.\n\n\n2. Oxford.\n [32] [33] Heritage's claim for tortious interference and slander of title in connection with its\nagreement with Oxford were not specifically pleaded until May 1, 1992. The evidence in the record\nestablishes that the Oxford contract was dated May 10, 1987, but apparently executed in either late\nSeptember or early October of 1987, prior to Heritage filing suit. Thus, at the time Heritage filed its\noriginal petition there appears in the record at least some basis that a ripe claim existed for which\nit could seek recovery. Heritage's petition, although not specific as to the third party transaction\nthat had failed, did allege causes of action for tortious interference and cloud on title arising from\nHunt/Hill's attempts to remove Heritage as Operator. We find that Heritage's original petition was\nsufficient to vest the trial court with subject matter jurisdiction over the Oxford claim and the First\nAmended Petition filed on May 1, 1992 relates back to the original petition to preserve the cause of\naction. Further, Hunt/Hill did not specially except to Heritage's pleading and, therefore, any defect\nin pleading was waived. TEX.R.CIV.P. 90; TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 16.068;\nService Lloyds Ins. Co. v. Slay, 800 S.W.2d 359, 362 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1990, writ denied).\n\nThough we can find no evidence to support the jury's finding that the Oxford transaction did not\nterminate before April 30, 1990, that date is not a vital fact because of the foregoing rule of law\nregarding relation back. We conclude that there is legally and factually sufficient evidence in\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 27\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nthe record to find that *119 Heritage's causes of action with respect to the Oxford participation\nagreement were not barred by the statute of limitations. We therefore overrule both portions of\nPoints of Error 7 and 29.\n\n\n3. Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron Transactions.\n [34] The evidence presented at trial with respect to the Sun transaction, the Enserch/Lone Star\ntransaction, and the Enron transaction conclusively established that they did not exist as causes\nof action at the time of Heritage's filing of its original petition. Instead, the evidence shows\nthat the Sun and Enron transactions came into existence and failed after December 18, 1987.\nWhile Heritage entered into negotiations with Enserch/Lone Star as early as September 1987, the\nevidence also shows that the transaction did not fail until after December 18, 1987. We determine\nthese transactions to be wholly new, distinct, and different transactions from the causes of action\npled in the original pleading, and as a result, the amended pleading may not relate back, pursuant\nto Section 16.068, to the date of the original pleading for the purposes of limitations. Ex parte\nGoad, 690 S.W.2d at 896–97; Duran, 921 S.W.2d at 791–92. Therefore, Heritage's claims based\nupon these transactions were, unlike the non-consent interests or Oxford, not ripe at the time of\nHeritage's filing of its original petition and were wholly different from the causes of actions raised\nin the original petition. Consequently, the trial court could not, as a matter of law, obtain subject\nmatter jurisdiction over these claims and the statute of limitations on these claims could not have\nbeen tolled as the claims did not exist. Thus, Heritage's first amended petition must be treated as\nits original petition for purposes of the subsequently arising causes of action. Under the applicable\nstatute of limitations, Heritage was required to file suit upon these claims within two years of the\ndate that such causes of action accrued, i.e., the date that injury to Heritage resulted.\n\n\na. The Sun Transaction.\n [35] Heritage has failed to cite to any evidence in the record, and we have found none, which\nsupports the jury finding that the Sun negotiations continued until April 30, 1990. Finding no\nevidence in the record to support the jury finding, we examined the record to determine if the\nevidence conclusively established an earlier date for the failure of the Sun transaction and accrual\nof Heritage's cause of action.\n\nRick Baldwin, manager of corporate acquisitions in 1988 and 1989, testified that Sun's\ninvolvement with Heritage began in 1988. Sun made two offers of contract to purchase Heritage's\ninterests in the Crittendon Field in February 1989 and March 1989. Michael Wisenbaker testified\nthat in December of 1987, there was no pending transaction between Heritage and Sun regarding\nHeritage's sale of its Crittendon Field interests. Furthermore, Heritage admitted in its brief that\nthe Sun transaction did not exist, either in contract or negotiation, in December of 1987, when\nHeritage's original petition was filed. The evidence is clear, unequivocal and convincing that\nSun terminated its contract with Heritage on March 13, 1989. We, therefore, find that the jury's\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                28\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nanswer to Question 34 was not supported by legally sufficient evidence and that the evidence\nconclusively established an earlier date for the accrual of Heritage's cause of action based upon\nthe Sun transaction.\n\nHeritage's causes of action for tortious interference with contractual relations and slander of title\nas to Sun began to run as of March 13, 1989. Heritage should have filed suit on those causes of\naction not later than March 14, 1991. The first amended petition was not, however, filed until\nMay 1, 1992. Heritage is, therefore, precluded from recovery on the Sun transaction for tortious\ninterference with contract and slander of title as it failed to timely file suit on those claims.\n\n\nb. The Enserch/Lone Star Transaction.\n[36] Heritage, again, has not cited any evidence in the record and we have not found any evidence\nwhich supports the jury finding to Question 39 that the Enserch/Lone Star negotiations continued\nuntil April 30, 1990. Finding no evidence in the record to support the jury's finding that the\nEnserch/Lone Star negotiations continued until April 30, 1990, *120 we examined the record to\ndetermine if the evidence definitively established an earlier date for the failure of the Enserch/\nLone Star transaction and accrual of Heritage's cause of action.\n\nMichael Wisenbaker testified that there was no transaction between Heritage and Enserch/Lone\nStar that could have been interfered with in December of 1987. The evidence presented at trial of\nnegotiations between Heritage and Enserch/Lone Star establishes that the negotiations began in\nSeptember 1987 and continued until December 1988.\n\nHeritage entered into evidence a November 2, 1988 memo and copies of three contracts and one\nloan agreement that were to be executed between Heritage and Enserch/Lone Star. In a December\n7, 1988 memo, the parties contemplated execution of the contracts within two to four working\ndays. The contracts were never signed, evidencing the failure of negotiations between Heritage\nand Enserch/Lone Star in December 1988. Heritage's cause of action accrued at that time. The\njury's answer to Question 39 was not supported by legally sufficient evidence and we conclude\nthat the evidence conclusively established an earlier date for the failure of the Enserch/Lone Star\ntransaction.\n\nWe find the evidence to be clear, unequivocal, and convincing that Heritage's claims for tortious\ninterference and slander of title in the Enserch/Lone Star transaction accrued no later than\nDecember 1988. Heritage was required to file suit upon this cause of action not later than January 1,\n1991; the First Amended Petition was not filed until May 1, 1992. Therefore, Heritage is precluded\nfrom recovery on the Enserch/Lone Star transaction for tortious interference with contract and\nslander of title as it failed to timely file suit upon these claims.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Enron Negotiations.\n [37] Once again, Heritage has not cited any evidence in the record, and we have not found any,\nwhich supports the jury finding that the Enron negotiations continued until April 30, 1990. As\nwith the Sun and Enserch/Lone Star transactions, we have examined the record to determine if the\nevidence conclusively established an earlier date for the failure of the Enron transaction.\n\nMichael Wisenbaker testified that there were no transactions or negotiations with Enron that\ncould have been interfered with in December of 1987. Negotiations between Enron and Heritage\nbegan in the summer of 1989. A representative of Enron testified that the last correspondence\nbetween the parties occurred in February of 1990. Heritage has also admitted in its pleadings\nthat negotiations between Enron and Heritage were over as of January 10, 1990, and the last\ncorrespondence between the two parties was a February 9, 1990 letter from Heritage to Enron.\nThe evidence presented on the issue is clear and unequivocal that negotiations between the parties\nended no later than February 9, 1990, the date of the last correspondence. Consequently, Heritage's\ncause of action for the failed Enron transaction accrued no later than February of 1990 and Heritage\nwas obligated to file suit on this claim certainly no later than March 1, 1992. The First Amended\nPetition was filed on May 1, 1992. Heritage is, therefore, precluded from recovery for tortious\ninterference and slander of title claims as to Enron as it failed to timely file suit upon these claims.\n\n\nd. Application of the Extension Statute.\nHeritage nonetheless argues that its original petition filed on December 18, 1987, was broad\nenough to place in issue all the conduct raised in subsequent pleadings. Heritage's contention is\nthat since the original petition was timely filed, the first amended petition properly relates back\nto the original petition because the causes of action relate to the same transaction or occurrence.\nWe disagree.\n\nHeritage has cited various cases, 1 including a number we have relied upon, which allow *121\nfor the addition of claims or damages sought through post limitation amendments. We find the\nargument wide of the target. In all cases cited by Heritage there existed, at the time of the original\nfiling, a cause of action upon which the plaintiff could recover, and in each case the amendment\nonly altered the theory of recovery, added an additional claim of relief upon the same facts, changed\ncertain factual assertions, or sought to add to the amount claimed in damages.\n\n [38] The controlling issue is the definition of the term “transaction.” Heritage seeks to define\nthe term “transaction” as it is used in Texas Civil Practice and Remedies § 16.068 simply as the\nwrongful act. However, it is fundamental that torts stem from the consequence of acts, not from\nthe acts themselves. There must be some sort of injury in order for a plaintiff's cause of action to\naccrue. For slander of title, there must be the loss of a specific sale; for tortious interference with\ncontract, there must be an existing contract and then interference with the contract which results\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   30\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nin harm. Without injury there are no damages, and without them both there is no recovery. We,\ntherefore, interpret the term “transaction” as it is used in Section 16.068, as that set of facts which\ngives rise to the cause of action premised thereon; in other words, as the totality of events which\nentitle a plaintiff to bring suit.\n\nThe case of Goad and its progeny provide useful interpretations of the extension statute which\nsupport our interpretation. In Goad, the Supreme Court explained that if the amended motion\n“does not allege a wholly new, distinct or different transaction, then it relates back to the original\nfiling and is not subject to a limitations defense.” Ex parte Goad, 690 S.W.2d at 896. In the\ninstant issue, there was no claim or cause of action upon which Heritage could seek recovery at\nthe time of filing its original petition. The evidence is clear that the Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and\nEnron transactions all came into existence and failed after the filing of the original petition. Most\nsignificant, however, is what they involved. The Sun transaction involved the negotiations for the\nsale of Heritage's entire interest in the Crittendon Field. While that would have obviously included\nHeritage's working interest in the 22 J.O.A., it is unrelated to the basic nature of the dispute or to\nthe causes of action originally pleaded. The Enserch/Lone Star and Enron transactions involved\ngas purchase agreements. The “transaction” upon which Heritage sought recovery in its original\npetition was clearly a different “transaction” from the “transactions” it sought recovery for in its\namended petition. The facts which would give rise to claims as to the Sun, Enserch/Lone Star,\nand Enron transactions simply did not exist at the time of the filing of the original petition. The\ncauses of action alleged in the first amended petition regarding the Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and\nEnron transactions arose from wholly new, distinct, or different transactions than that alleged in\nthe original petition. In either instance, we find that Heritage's claims for tortious interference and\nslander of title premised upon the Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron transactions are barred by\nlimitations.\n\n\ne. Automatic Stay Due to Bankruptcy.\n [39] [40] Heritage lastly argues that its involuntary bankruptcy in late August of 1989 stayed\nall proceedings against it until it emerged from bankruptcy in January of 1991. Relying on 11\nU.S.C.A. § 108 (1993), Heritage asserts that eighteen months must be added to the period in which\nit had to file its first amended petition. We simply do not read the statute that way. Section 108\nprovides that the limitations period includes any suspension occurring on or after commencement\nof the case in bankruptcy. The suspension referred to in Section 108 is that provided for in 11\nU.S.C.A. § 362 (1993) which is the automatic stay of all judicial proceedings that were or could\nhave been commenced before the case in bankruptcy against the debtor. Section 362 does not\napply to actions filed by the debtor. McMillan v. MBank Fort Worth, N.A., 4 F.3d 362, 366 (5th\nCir.1993); Freeman v. Commissioner of Internal *122 Revenue, 799 F.2d 1091, 1092–93 (5th\nCir.1986). We find that Heritage cannot avail itself of the protection afforded by Sections 108 and\n362 on claims it initiated.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Standard of Review.\nHunt/Hill have challenged the legal and factual sufficiency of the jury findings of tortious\ninterference, slander of title, and fraud. Although we have already determined that the statute of\nlimitations bars many of Heritage's claims, and that there were no non-consent interests in the\n22–3 well to be carried by Heritage, in the interest of judicial economy, considering the merits\nof the principal points of error raised here is appropriate. In considering a legal sufficiency or\n“no evidence” point, an appellate court considers only the evidence which tends to support the\njury's findings and disregards all evidence and inferences to the contrary. Garza v. Alviar, 395\nS.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex.1965); Worsham Steel Co. v. Arias, 831 S.W.2d 81, 83 (Tex.App.—El Paso\n1992, no writ). If any probative evidence supports the jury's determination, it must be upheld. In re\nKing's Estate, 150 Tex. 662, 244 S.W.2d 660, 661–62 (1951); see generally William Powers, Jr.\n& Jack Ratliff, Another Look at “No Evidence” and “Insufficient Evidence,” 69 TEXAS L.REV.\n515 (1991).\n\nA factual sufficiency point requires examination of all of the evidence in determining whether\nthe finding in question is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be\nmanifestly unjust. In re King's Estate, 244 S.W.2d at 661; Worsham Steel Co., 831 S.W.2d at 83.\nThe reviewing court cannot substitute its conclusions for those of the jury. If there is sufficient\ncompetent evidence of probative force to support the finding, it must be sustained. Carrasco v.\nGoatcher, 623 S.W.2d 769, 772 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1981, no writ).

Tortious Interference with a Contract or Prospective Business Relationship.\nTexas law protects existing and prospective contracts from interference. Juliette Fowler Homes,\nInc., 793 S.W.2d at 665. The principal difference between the two involves the requirement of a\ncontract as opposed to a potential for a contract and the question of justification or defense which\nis borne by the defendant in a tortious interference with contract case. The elements are: (1) the\nexistence of a contract subject to interference; (2) a willful and intentional act of interference; (3)\nthe act was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's damage; and (4) actual damage or loss occurred.\nHolloway, 898 S.W.2d at 795–96; Armendariz, 553 S.W.2d at 404. Like all business torts, these\nelements may seem simple but there are numerous exceptions.\n\n [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] The first requirement is essentially a qualification that there must\nbe a “contract subject to interference.” All contracts are not subject to interference. There must\nbe a valid contract. Juliette Fowler Homes, Inc., 793 S.W.2d at 665. The second requirement\nconcerning “willful and intentional” is dependent upon a strict requirement of adequate proof to\ndemonstrate this requirement. There must be some direct evidence of a willful act of interference.\nBrowning–Ferris, Inc. v. Reyna, 865 S.W.2d 925, 927 (Tex.1993). The interfering party must\nknow of the existence of a contract between the plaintiff and a third party or have knowledge of\nfacts that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that a contract existed. Armendariz, 553\nS.W.2d at 406. The interference must proximately cause damage or harm. State Nat'l Bank of El\nPaso, 678 S.W.2d at 689. The measure of damages for tortious interference is the same for breach\nof contract; the plaintiff is to be put in the same economic position as if the contract had not been\nbreached. Armendariz, 553 S.W.2d at 406.\n\n [46] Generally, the interfering party is justified in interfering if the actions are done in a bona fide\nexercise of the party's own rights or if the party has an equal or superior right in the subject matter.\nVictoria Bank & Trust v. Brady, 811 S.W.2d 931, 939 (Tex.1991). Justification may include the\nright to file a lawsuit provided this is done in good faith with the belief that there is a colorable\nclaim. *124 Texas Beef Cattle Co., 921 S.W.2d at 211; Tidal Western Oil Corp., 297 S.W. at\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

An interfering party is privileged to protect its own legitimate financial interest. Central Sav.\nand Loan Ass'n, 848 S.W.2d at 241.\n\n [47] In an action concerning a prospective business relationship, the elements are: (1) the\nreasonable probability that a contractual relationship would have been entered; (2) an intentional,\nmalicious intervention with the formation of that relationship; (3) without privilege or justification;\n(4) resulting in actual damage or loss. Gonzalez, 905 S.W.2d at 421. It is not necessary to prove\nthat the contract would have certainly been made but for the interference; it must be reasonably\nprobable, considering all of the facts and circumstances attendant to the transaction. Exxon Corp.\nv. Allsup, 808 S.W.2d 648, 659 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1991, writ denied). More than mere\nnegotiations must have taken place. Caller–Times Publ'g Co. v. Triad Communications, Inc., 855\nS.W.2d 18, 24 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1993, no writ); Grace, 853 S.W.2d at 96. The act of\ninterference must be purposefully done with the intent to harm the plaintiff.\n\n [48] [49] The plaintiff has the burden of proving lack of justification or excuse in a tortious\ninterference with prospective business relationship cause of action. Tarleton State Univ. v. Rosiere,\n867 S.W.2d 948, 952 (Tex.App.—Eastland 1993, writ dism'd by agr.). However, other than\nthe difference in burden of proof, justification involves the same type of proof as in a tortious\ninterference with contract. A superior financial interest, for example, is recognized as justification\nor excuse. Gillum v. Republic Health Corp., 778 S.W.2d 558, 566 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1989, no\nwrit). Lastly, it must be demonstrated that the plaintiff suffered some actual damage or harm. The\nmeasure of such damages is, however, different from tortious interference with contract as the\ndamages are not strictly based upon contract rules. Allsup, 808 S.W.2d at 660.\n\n\n1. Non–Consent Interests.\nHeritage claims that the development of the 22–3 well was properly proposed under the terms of\nthe 22 J.O.A., that Hunt/Hill elected not to participate in the operation, and that Heritage carried the\nnon-consenting interests of Hunt/Hill. The jury found that Heritage had both an agreement and a\nreasonable probability of making such an agreement to sell the non-consent interests that it claimed\nit carried in the 22–3 well to Craig Sandahl, Bruce Heafitz, Jack Bestrom, Mobil Producing Texas\nand New Mexico, and E.R. Duke.\n\n [50] [51] Because there were no non-consent interests created in the 22–3 well, any contracts\nor probability of entering into such contracts were void and not subject to interference. We find\nfrom the record before us that not only is there a complete absence of evidence to support the\nvital fact that there were non-consent interests in the 22–3 well, but that the evidence conclusively\nestablishes the opposite of that fact. Consequently, the first element of tortious interference with a\ncontract or prospective business relationship could not be legally or factually proven. We do find,\nhowever, that considering only the evidence and inferences which support the remainder of the\njury's findings, the remaining elements of willful and intentional acts, proximate cause of damage,\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   35\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nand actual damage or loss was legally and factually sufficient. See Holloway, 898 S.W.2d at 795–\n96; Juliette Fowler Homes, Inc., 793 S.W.2d at 665; Armendariz, 553 S.W.2d at 404. There is clear,\nprobative evidence that Hunt/Hill were aware and had actual knowledge of Heritage's attempts\nto market the claimed non-consent interests and sufficient evidence for a reasonable person to\nconclude Hunt/Hill's actions protesting Heritage's claim were actionable acts of interference which\nwas the proximate cause of damages suffered by Heritage. See State Nat'l Bank of El Paso, 678\nS.W.2d at 691. We finally note that the measure of damages for tortious interference with contract\nis the same as for breach of contract, that objective being to put the plaintiff in the same economic\nposition he would have been in had the contract not been breached. Armendariz, 553 S.W.2d at\n404. Loss of the benefit of the bargain damages are also recoverable under a fraud cause of action.\n *125 Peco Const. Co. v. Guajardo, 919 S.W.2d 736, 738–39 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1996,\nwrit denied), citing W.O. Bankston Nissan, Inc. v. Walters, 754 S.W.2d 127, 128 (Tex.1988). We\nfind the jury's award of 7.9 million dollars to be legally sufficient as there is some evidence that\nthe amount awarded was a reasonable measure of actual damage suffered as a result of the loss\nof the non-consent sales, and factually sufficient because the evidence was not clearly against the\ngreat weight and preponderance of the evidence to be manifestly unjust. As a result, if there had\nbeen non-consent interests to market, we would have sustained Points of Error 1b, c, and overruled\nPoints of Error 1d, e, and 2a. We need not address Point of Error 2b.\n\n\n2. Oxford.\nHunt/Hill complain that there is no or insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of tortious\ninterference with the participation agreement Heritage had with Oxford. Oxford entered a letter\nagreement dated May 10, 1987 with Heritage for Oxford to participate in the 22–3 well. Oxford\nagreed to bear 64.5 percent of all drilling and testing costs and 58.3 percent of the casing costs\nat completion in exchange for the assignment of an undivided working interest of 33.33 percent\nin the 22–3 well. Jerry Anderson, the president of Oxford, testified that Oxford received letters\nin March 1988 from attorneys representing Hunt/Hill asserting that Hunt/Hill were not non-\nconsenting and that their interests were not subject to being carried. He further testified that in\nAugust 1988, Oxford, which to that point had paid approximately four million dollars, decided to\ntake a proportional reduction in the working interest to be earned and ceased making payments\nto Heritage.\n\n [52] Considering only the evidence and reasonable inferences that tend to support the finding and\nignoring all evidence and inferences contrary to the jury's findings, we must conclude that there\nis at least some evidence of probative force to support the finding. It is clear from the record and\nuncontested that there was a valid and enforceable contract between Oxford and Heritage. There is\nalso direct evidence of actions by Hunt/Hill which establish evidence of acts of interference. What\nHunt/Hill do contest is whether there is any evidence or sufficient evidence to establish the element\nof willful intent and actual damages. We conclude that there was legally and factually sufficient\nproof for the jury to conclude that the act of interference by Hunt/Hill was the proximate cause of\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 36\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nthe damages suffered. Though Oxford's president testified that the reason for stopping payments\non the participation agreement with Heritage was that of concerns that Heritage was diverting\nOxford's investment to other wells and uncertainty and lack of information about operations at the\n22–3 well, his testimony was contradicted, his credibility strongly challenged, and in particular,\nhis subsequent cooperation with Hunt/Hill could reasonably be considered suspect. Simply stated,\nthe evidence in this record furnishes some reasonable basis for differing conclusions by reasonable\nminds as to the existence of the essential facts. Moreover, in a no evidence challenge, the appellate\ncourt may not substitute its view of the credibility of witnesses for that of the jury. Benoit, 239\nS.W.2d at 797. We may not substitute our view of the credibility of witnesses for that of the jury in\na no evidence challenge, and as a result, that challenge here must fail. In light of all the evidence,\nwe are also unable to find the jury's verdict to be clearly wrong and manifestly unjust, so that there\nis factually sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Hunt/Hill's acts of interference\nwillful and knowing and proximately caused actual damage to Heritage.\n\n [53] The jury awarded 3.16 million dollars in actual damages for the tortious interference with\nthe Oxford contract. Though we are unable, from the record before us, to understand exactly what\ninterest in the 22–3 well that Oxford had bargained for, it is clear from the testimony elicited by all\nsides that Heritage's claimed non-consent interests formed at least part of the undivided interest to\nbe earned by Oxford. Given the evidence that Oxford had contributed approximately four million\ndollars before it ceased participating and evidence of the total drilling and production costs of the\n22–3 well, the jury's award for actual damages was both legally *126 and factually sufficient.\nWe, therefore, overrule Points of Error 5b, c, and 6a.\n\n\n3. Sun.\nThis transaction involved Sun negotiations to acquire all interests in the Crittendon Field. We have\nfound that Heritage's cause of action related to this transaction, and also the next two, Enserch/\nLone Star and Enron, are barred by the statute of limitations. We will, however, at least briefly,\naddress the merits of the points of error raised as a matter of judicial prudence.\n\nHunt/Hill challenge the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury finding that\nthey tortiously interfered with the Sun contract or probable contract to purchase all of Heritage's\ninterest in the Crittendon Field and the resulting jury award of more than $27.5 million. Beginning\nsometime in 1988 and culminating in the first quarter of 1989, Sun began negotiations to acquire\nthe Crittendon Field oil and gas interests which included the 21 and 22 J.O.A. interests. Sun made\ntwo offers to Heritage and Heritage verbally accepted the second offer made on March 9, 1989.\nAt approximately the same time, Sun also offered to purchase the interests of Hunt/Hill, and was\naware of pending litigation between Heritage and Hunt/Hill. On March 13, 1989, Heritage advised\nSun that the 22–2 well had begun producing water and Sun withdrew its offer of purchase.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 37\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nHunt/Hill have separately challenged the legal and factual sufficiency of evidence necessary to\nprove every element of tortious interference, those being: (1) a contract subject to interference or\na probable business relationship; (2) knowledge of the contract or proposed contract and intent to\ninterfere; (3) proximate cause; and (4) actual damages. We conclude that the only issues which\nmerit discussion are whether there was a contract subject to interference and proximate cause as\nwe find that the record establishes both legally and factually sufficient evidence to support the\njury's favorable findings of the other required elements and damages.\n\n [54] [55] It is clear and uncontradicted that at the same time Sun was negotiating with Heritage,\nit was also negotiating with Hunt/Hill. Indeed, it is evident that Sun was only interested in the\nacquisition of all working interests in the Crittendon Field. Hunt/Hill argue that because Sun was\nnegotiating with both sides here that as a matter of law, Hunt/Hill could not interfere with their\nown contract with Sun. We agree. Whatever the claimed actions of Hunt/Hill were or might have\nbeen, and notwithstanding the fact that Sun would have to acquire by separate contracts all various\nworking interests necessary to acquire the entire interest, because the financial interests of Heritage\nand Hunt/Hill were identical with respect to their business relationship to Sun, there can be no\nliability for the actions of Hunt/Hill. A party to a business relation cannot tortiously interfere with\nitself. Coastal Corp. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 852 S.W.2d 714, 720 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi,\n1993, no writ).\n\n [56] [57] Finally, we are unable to find any evidence of proximate causation. It is clear that Sun\nwithdrew its offer to purchase interests in the Crittendon Field because the 22–2 well had begun\nto water. We understand Heritage's argument to be that the reason why the business relationship\nwas terminated is not the issue, but rather delaying or hindering the negotiations. In other words,\nHunt/Hill prevented the sale of Crittendon Field before the 22–2 well watered out. A plaintiff\nmust be able to show that the act of interference was the proximate cause of the damages suffered\nby it. This is the classic proximate cause test with the component elements of cause in fact and\nforeseeability. State Nat'l Bank of El Paso, 678 S.W.2d at 691. We find that evidence is legally\ninsufficient to support a finding that Hunt/Hill's actions, if any, were the proximate cause of any\ndamages suffered by Heritage.\n\nWe overrule Points of Error 9d and 10a, and sustain Points of Error 9b, c, and e. We need not\naddress Point of Error 10b.\n\n\n4. Enserch/Lone Star and Enron.\n [58] We consider the last two transactions upon which Heritage recovered for tortious\ninterference together. Heritage sought to obtain a prepayment gas contract with Enserch/Lone\nStar. Heritage also negotiated *127 without success with Enron for a gas purchase agreement.\nThe jury found that Hunt/Hill tortiously interfered with those negotiations in each situation and\nawarded Heritage damages more than $23.2 million in connection with Enserch/Lone Star and\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                38\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n$4.5 million on account of Enron. Hunt/Hill have challenged the legal and factual sufficiency of\nevidence with respect to all of the elements necessary under each claim of tortious interference.\nRecalling that we have held that Heritage's causes of action regarding this transaction are barred by\nthe statute of limitations, we have nonetheless considered the merits of Hunt/Hill's points of error\nregarding the sufficiency of evidence. With regard to the “no evidence” points, considering only\nthe evidence and reasonable inferences that tend to support the findings and ignoring all contrary\nevidence and inferences, we find that there is some evidence to support those findings. There was\ntestimony and documentary evidence of negotiations which a reasonable person might conclude\nwould result in a contractual business relationship. There was at least some evidence that Hunt/\nHill had knowledge of the negotiations, that there was an intent on the part of Hunt/Hill to interfere\nwith those negotiations, and that Hunt/Hill's actions were the proximate cause of the damages\nsuffered by Heritage. As for the damages awarded, there is some evidence in the form of Michael\nWisenbaker's testimony and various pricing and cost documents in the record.\n\nConsidering Hunt/Hill's challenge to the factual sufficiency, we have likewise concluded that after\nexamination of all the evidence, that we are unable to say that the evidence is so weak as to be\nclearly wrong and manifestly unjust. Though our own view of the evidence is different, we will not\nsubstitute our view for that of the jury where much of this case weighed upon the credibility of the\nprincipal witnesses on each side, moreover, we are mindful that a preponderance of the evidence\nunanimously convinced the jury in this case. We overrule Points of Error 13b, c, d, e, 14a, 17b, c,\nd, e, and 18a. We need not address Points of Error 14b and 18b.\n\n\nC. Slander of Title.\nThe issues involved in these series of points involve Heritage's position as the Operator under\nthe 22 J.O.A., that is, whether Heritage had the requisite interest to hold that position. Heritage's\nclaims arise from utterances and publishing challenges to Heritage's interest in the 22 J.O.A., that\nHeritage had been removed as Operator, that Heritage was a bad faith trespasser, and illegally\ndrilled the 22–3 well. The jury found that Hunt/Hill slandered Heritage's title to Sections 21 and\n22, and awarded actual damages of approximately $7.988 million with respect to the non-consent\nsales and $3.1 million with respect to the Oxford agreement. The jury found zero damages with\nrespect to Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron transactions; however, the trial court disregarded\nthe jury's verdict and awarded the same, respective damages as were awarded under the tortious\ninterference claims.\n\n [59] To prove slander of title, Heritage was required to show that Hunt/Hill published false\nstatements maliciously, and these statements caused special damages to Heritage's interest in land.\n“Malice,” for purposes of this tort, is defined as making false statements regarding title in absence\nof color of title or a reasonable belief that parties have title.

Non–Consent Interests.\n [60] Heritage's claim of slander of title and the award of damages with respect to the non-consent\ninterests fails as a matter of law because there were no non-consent interests to be sold. A plaintiff\nseeking to recover damages in a slander of title action must prove the loss of a specific sale in\norder to recover. A.H. Belo Corp. v. Sanders, 632 S.W.2d 145, 146 (Tex.1982). Though the title or\ninterest claimed to have been maliciously disparaged is evidently distinct from the issue of whether\nor not there were non-consent interest carried by Heritage, the fact remains *128 that Heritage\nhad no non-consent interests to sell. Thus, we find that the evidence in the record conclusively\nestablishes the opposite of a vital fact and Hunt/Hill's no evidence challenge must be sustained\nwith respect to the non-consent interests. Points of Error 23b, c, d, e, f, and 24a are again sustained;\nwe need not address Point of Error 24b.\n\n\n2. Oxford.\n [61] As we have stated before, it is unclear what interests Oxford expected to earn in return for its\nparticipation in the 22–3 well. Certainly, there is some evidence that Oxford expected that it was\nindeed earning some of the non-consent interests which it understood that Heritage was carrying.\nHowever, the evidence is not conclusive that those interests were the exclusive consideration for\nOxford's participation agreement. As a consequence, we are unable to say that there is either a\ncomplete absence of evidence or that the evidence supporting the jury's finding is so weak as to\nbe clearly wrong and manifestly unjust.\n\n [62] [63] [64] We also find it clear from the record that the identical awards for both tortious\ninterference and slander of title for the same transactions are duplicative as a matter of law. Texas\nlaw does not permit double recovery. Southern County Mut. Ins. Co. v. First Bank and Trust of\nGroves, 750 S.W.2d 170, 173–74 (Tex.1988). When the prevailing party fails to elect between\nalternative measures of damages, the court should render the judgment affording the greatest\nrecovery. See, e.g., Kish v. Van Note, 692 S.W.2d 463, 468–69 (Tex.1985)(rendering judgment\nfor each separate element of damages in order to give the plaintiffs complete compensation for\ntheir losses). Points of Error 27b, c, d, e, f, and 28a are overruled. We sustain Point of Error 28b,\nand dismiss Point of Error 6b as moot.\n\n\n3. Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron.\nWe have earlier concluded that these claims are barred by the statute of limitations. As a result it\nis not necessary to reach the merits of the sufficiency points raised. We do note, however, that it\nappears clear from the record before us that the identical awards for both tortious interference and\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Southern County Mut. Ins. Co., 750 S.W.2d at 173–\n74. Points of Error 32b, 36b, 40b, and 43b are sustained; it is unnecessary to consider Points of\nError 31b, c, d, e, f, 32a, c, 35b, c, d, e, f, 36a, c, 39b, c, d, e, f, 40a, and c.\n\n\n\n                                                         VII.\n\n\n                 Were Hunt/Hill “justified” in their actions for which they might\n                 otherwise be liable for tortious interference or slander of title?\n\n\n                              Points of Error 8, 12, 16, 20, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42.\n\nA. Standard of Review.\nThe jury found in each instance submitted that Hunt/Hill were not justified in their actions in\nconnection with each alleged instance of tortious interference and slander of title.\n\n[65]     [66] The jury was instructed that:\n\n            You are instructed that the conduct of the Defendants was justified or excused\n            if (1) it was done in the good faith exercise of their own rights, or (2) if they\n            had equal or superior rights in the subject matter of the potential transactions to\n            that of Heritage. One is justified in asserting a claim, even if the validity of that\n            claim is doubtful, so long as it is possible that the claim may have merit.\n\nHunt/Hill have challenged each of these adverse findings as being legally and factually\ninsufficient. Their challenges have been framed as if Hunt/Hill had the burden of proof, i.e.\n“as a matter of law” and “against the great weight and preponderance” even though, as earlier\ndiscussed, they had the burden of proof only with respect to the tortious interference claims. A\nlegal sufficiency challenge of “as a matter of law” applies when the challenging party has the\nburden of proof. Sterner v. Marathon Oil Co., 767 S.W.2d 686, 690 (Tex.1989). We *129 must\nfirst examine the record for evidence that supports the adverse finding, while ignoring all evidence\nto the contrary. Id. If there is no evidence to support the failure to find, then we examine the entire\nrecord to determine whether the proposition is established as a matter of law. The challenger must\nthen demonstrate that the evidence conclusively establishes all vital facts in support of the issue\nas a matter of law. Worsham Steel Co., 831 S.W.2d at 81. A factual sufficiency point requires\nexamination of all the evidence in determining whether the adverse finding is so against the great\nweight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust.

Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n\nB. Justification.\n [67] [68] The general rule is that a party's interference is justified if the interference with the\ncontractual relations of another is done in a bona fide exercise of its own rights, or if the actor has\nan equal or superior right in the subject matter to that of the other party. Victoria Bank & Trust\nCo., 811 S.W.2d at 939. In a tortious interference with a contract case, the privilege of justification\nor excuse is an affirmative defense on which the defendant has the burden of proof. Sterner, 767\nS.W.2d at 691. In a tortious interference with prospective business relationship case privilege or\njustification is an element of the action; hence, the burden of pleading and proof is on the plaintiff.\nTarleton State Univ., 867 S.W.2d at 952.\n\n [69] [70] [71] Factors to be considered in determining whether a privilege exists include: (1)\nthe nature of the conduct; (2) the interests of the injured party; (3) the actor's motive; (4) the\ninterests sought to be advanced by the actor; (5) the social interests in protecting the freedom of\naction of the actor and the contractual interests of the other; (6) the proximity of the actor's conduct\nto the interference; and (7) the relations between the parties. Maynard v. Caballero, 752 S.W.2d\n719, 721 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1988, writ denied). Justification includes the filing of a lawsuit, so\nlong as it is done in good faith with the belief that there is a colorable claim. Texas Beef Cattle\nCo., 921 S.W.2d at 211; Tidal Western Oil Corp., 297 S.W. at 281. It may also cover the actions\nof the interfering party to protect its own legitimate financial interests. Central Sav. and Loan\nAss'n, 848 S.W.2d at 241. A superior financial interest is recognized as justification or excuse.\nGillum, 778 S.W.2d at 566. Apart from the difference in burden, the justification or excuse, in\neither of the foregoing actions, involves the same type of proof and the question is one for the jury.\nSouthwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. John Carlo Texas, Inc., 843 S.W.2d 470, 472 (Tex.1992).\n\n [72] [73] In an action for slander of title, the party must allege and prove, inter alia, the utterings\nand publishing of disparaging words; however, communications in the due course of a judicial\nproceeding may not serve as the basis of a civil action for slander of title, and consequently,\nconstitutes a privilege of justification or excuse. See Reagan v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 140\nTex. 105, 166 S.W.2d 909, 912 (1942); James v. Brown, 637 S.W.2d 914, 916 (Tex.1982). This\nprivilege encompasses all aspects of the judicial proceedings including statements made in open\ncourt, depositions, affidavits and pleadings, and papers of the case. Id. at 916–17.\n\n\nC. Application to facts.\n\n1. Non–Consent Interests.\n[74] [75] As we have determined that there were no non-consent interests to be carried by\nHeritage, it necessarily follows that Hunt/Hill had a superior right in the subject matter to that\nof Heritage and that its interference with either the contractual or prospective business relations\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 42\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nregarding the non-consent interest was justified as a bona fide exercise of their own rights. Victoria\nBank & Trust Co., 811 S.W.2d at 939. In a slander of title action, however, and unlike tortious\ninterference, the only privilege accorded defamatory remarks are for those remarks published as\na part of judicial proceedings. James, 637 S.W.2d at 916–17. Hunt/Hill nevertheless argue that\nbecause all communications regarding the non-consent interest were uttered or published after both\ntheir own lawsuit in Dallas County and this suit in Winkler that all communications are protected\nunder the judicial proceedings *130 privilege. We conclude, however, that there is some evidence\nthat Hunt/Hill's communications were neither preliminary to nor in contemplation of any judicial\nproceeding, and their utterance or publication, even though after the institution of the law suits, is\nnot absolutely privileged. We accordingly overrule both portions of Point of Error 26.\n\n\n2. Oxford.\n [76] As was noted earlier, it is not entirely clear from the record exactly what working interests\nin the 22–3 well Oxford sought to acquire as consideration for its participation agreement with\nHeritage. From the testimony of Oxford's president, Jerry Anderson, and the questions presented\nto him by all sides, it does seem clear that Oxford thought it was participating to gain the non-\nconsent interests that Heritage maintained it was carrying, but we also find it evident that more\nthan just non-consent interests were involved. As a consequence, we cannot say, as we did above,\nthat there is no evidence in the record to conclusively establish that Hunt/Hill were justified or\nexcused in their interference, nor do we find that the great weight of the evidence in favor of\njustification to be so contrary to the jury's adverse finding on the issue as to be manifestly unjust.\n\nFinally, we have also found sufficient evidence in the record of utterances and publications that\nwere outside and beyond the protection and privilege accorded judicial proceedings. Accordingly,\nwe overrule Points of Error 8 and 30.\n\n\n3. Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron.\n [77] Considering the same factors as this Court did in Maynard, 752 S.W.2d at 721, and\ncomparing those factors to the record before us, we are unable to find that the evidence with\nregard to the Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron transactions was either legally or factually\ninsufficient. The same result is reached whether the burden of establishing a privilege is on Hunt/\nHill or Heritage. Hunt/Hill's principal argument relies upon the absolute privilege accorded judicial\nproceedings; however, there are pleadings and evidence of probative force in the record which\nwe find to be neither preliminary to nor in contemplation of a judicial proceeding. As a result,\nHunt/Hill's no evidence and insufficient evidence challenges, as to the tortious interference and\nslander of title actions involving the Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron transactions must fail.\nWe overrule Points of Error 12, 16, 20, 34, 38, and 42.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The jury agreed. Hunt/Hill's complaint here is three-fold: first, that the claim sounds\nin contract, not tort; second, that any recovery for fraud is waived by the failure of Heritage to\nobtain a finding of damages for fraud; and thirdly, that there is no evidence or insufficient evidence\nto support a finding of fraud.\n\n [78] We have already rejected the argument that Heritage's claims sound only in contract, not\ntort. Indeed, the claim here is precisely the situation where a party's actions regarding a contract\nmay rise to the level of a tort. See American Nat'l Petroleum Co., 798 S.W.2d at 278. Every\ncontract, including J.O.A.s, carries the common law duty to perform the agreed tasks with care,\nskill, reasonable expedience, and faithfulness so that a breach thereof constitutes a tort as well as\na breach of contract. Montgomery Ward & Co., 204 S.W.2d at 510. As we earlier noted, the Texas\nSupreme Court reaffirmed that concept, holding that “tort damages are recoverable for a fraudulent\ninducement claim irrespective of whether the fraudulent representations are later subsumed in a\ncontract or whether the plaintiff only suffers an economic loss related to the subject matter of the\ncontract.” Formosa *131 Plastics Corp. USA, 41 Tex.Sup.Ct.J. at 293, 960 S.W.2d at 44.\n\n [79] The jury was first asked, in Question 8, to decide whether the 22–3 well was covered by\nthe 22 J.O.A.; an affirmative answer then required them to decide in Question 11 that Hunt/\nHill's failure to comply with the 22 J.O.A. was not excused. Question 12 then asked if Hunt/Hill\nagreed to participate in the 22–3 well in exchange for Heritage's stopping drilling of the 22–2 well.\nAgain the jury responded affirmatively, requiring them to answer Question 13, which was whether\nthose actions constituted a fraud on Heritage, and again, the jury said “yes.” Conditioned upon an\naffirmative finding in Question 12, the jury was then asked, in Question 14, to assess damages\nfor Hunt/Hill's “failure to pay their shares of the 22–3 well costs.” Hunt/Hill now contend that no\ndamages question was submitted in connection with the fraud found; hence, any recovery for fraud\nwas waived. We do not construe the jury findings so narrow as to find that Heritage is precluded\nfrom any recovery for fraud. Though the question of damages was predicated upon an affirmative\nanswer to the action described in Question 12, which the jury found to constitute fraud in Question\n13, we conclude that there was a proper finding of actual tort damages by the jury.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n\nThe last remaining issue is whether there was legally or factually sufficient evidence to support\nthe finding of fraud. In considering a legal sufficiency or “no evidence” point, an appellate court\nconsiders only the evidence which tends to support the jury's findings and disregards all evidence\nand inferences to the contrary. Garza, 395 S.W.2d at 823; Worsham Steel Co., 831 S.W.2d at 83.\nIf any probative evidence supports the jury's determination, it must be upheld. In re King's Estate,\n244 S.W.2d at 661–62; see generally William Powers, Jr. & Jack Ratliff, Another Look at “No\nEvidence” and “Insufficient Evidence,” 69 TEXAS L.REV. 515 (1991). A factual sufficiency\npoint requires examination of all of the evidence in determining whether the finding in question\nis so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust. In\nre King's Estate, 244 S.W.2d at 661; Worsham Steel Co., 831 S.W.2d at 81. The reviewing court\ncannot substitute its conclusions for those of the jury. If there is sufficient competent evidence of\nprobative force to support the finding, it must be sustained. Carrasco, 623 S.W.2d at 772.\n\n[80] The elements of common law fraud have long been recognized in Texas as:\n\n   • that a material representation was made;\n\n   • that it was false;\n\n   • that, when the speaker made it, he knew it was false or made it recklessly without any\n      knowledge of its truth and as a positive assertion;\n\n   • that he made it with the intention that it should be acted upon by the party;\n\n   • that the party acted in reliance upon it; and\n\n   • that the party thereby suffered injury.\n\nState Nat'l Bank of El Paso, 678 S.W.2d at 681. Another key factor is whether the Hunt/Hill's\npromise to participate in the 22–3 well is actionable because at the time the promise was made\nHunt/Hill made it with the intent not to perform the promise. Spoljaric, 708 S.W.2d at 434.\n\n [81] [82] [83] [84] We first note that the 22 J.O.A. unambiguously provides circumstances in\nwhich a well can be stopped short of its contract depth: (1) if further drilling is rendered impractical\nby granite or any other impenetrable substance or condition in the hole; or (2) if all parties agree\nto complete or abandon the well at a lesser depth. It also, as previously discussed, specifically\ndelineates the procedures to follow for proposing a new well. Once a new well is proposed in\nwriting, a party to the J.O.A. can then elect to take a consent position which then results in the\nobligation to pay the new well costs. But notwithstanding the contractual rights to consent or not\nconsent to the stopping of the 22–2 well, and subsequently, the right to consent or not consent to\nparticipate in the 22–3 well, we find that the record amply supports a jury finding of an independent\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                45\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\ntort. It is clear from the record the Hunt/Hill wanted drilling on the 22–2 well stopped because of\nnegotiations for the sale of their interest in the Crittendon Field. That, however, required unanimity\nby all working interest *132 owners under the terms of the J.O.A. There is also ample probative\nevidence for the jury to conclude that Hunt/Hill never intended to consent to a subsequent drilling\noperation which they were obligated to do under the terms of the J.O.A., or take a non-consent\ninterest. The critical focus being whether there is sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find that\nHunt/Hill's promise to participate in the 22–3 well is actionable because at the time the promise was\nmade Hunt/Hill made it with the intent not to perform the promise. Spoljaric, 708 S.W.2d at 434.\nWhile a party's intent is determined at the time the party made the representation, it may be inferred\nfrom the party's subsequent acts after the representation is made. Id. Since intent to defraud is not\nsusceptible to direct proof, it invariably must be proven by circumstantial evidence. Id. at 435.\nSlight circumstantial evidence of fraud, when considered with the breach of a promise to perform,\nis sufficient proof to support a finding of fraudulent intent. Id. The record contains sufficient\nevidence from which a reasonable jury could have inferred fraudulent intent. One example of this\nevidence is the transcript of the conversation between the Hunt brothers and Michael Wisenbaker\nthat took place on September 25, 1987. Unbeknownst to Wisenbaker, the Hunts secretly recorded\nthe conversation in which they told Wisenbaker: (1) that they were not contemplating the sale of\ntheir interests in the field, even though they had already initiated negotiations with Lyco Energy\nCorp; (2) that they wanted Wisenbaker to cease all drilling operations in Section 22, though for\nobvious reasons, they did not disclose to Wisenbaker that this was a condition precedent to the\nsale of their interests to Lyco Energy Corp; (3) that they had the requisite votes to remove Heritage\nas Operator, another misrepresentation; and (4) that they would remove Heritage as Operator if\nHeritage did not immediately cease all drilling operations in Section 22, notwithstanding their\nagreement to participate in the 22–3 well as a substitute well. Another example of this evidence is\nVirgil St. Clair's assertion that the 22–2 well had reached a depth sufficient to test the Fusselman\nformation when he was fully aware that the 22–2 well had not penetrated the Fusselman formation.\nOther examples of evidence supporting the jury's finding of fraudulent intent are the Hunt brothers'\ndenials at trial. At trial, both Hunt brothers denied that they had promised to participate in the\n22–3 well once Heritage agreed to stop drilling the 22–2 well. Ample evidence was produced\nto the contrary. A party's denial that he ever made a promise is a factor showing no intent to\nperform when he made the promise. Spoljaric, 708 S.W.2d at 435. We conclude that there was\nsufficient evidence for a rational jury to find that Hunt/Hill's promise to participate in the 22–3\nwell was actionable because at the time the promise was made Hunt/Hill made it with the intent\nnot to perform the promise. We also note that Hunt/Hill have never seriously disputed the factual\nsufficiency of the allegation and only tried to classify it as being legally insufficient as a claim\nsounding only in contract, not tort. Consequently, we overrule Point of Error 53.\n\n\n\n                                                         IX.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Specifically, Question 12 asked if any of the Defendants or their agents, “agree to pay\ntheir share of the 22–3 well costs in May, 1987 in exchange for Heritage's stopping the drilling of\nthe 22–2 well?” Since the jury answered Question 12 in the affirmative, they proceeded to answer\nQuestion 14 awarding Heritage damages for the defendants' failure to pay their share of the 22–\n3 well costs. Hunt/Hill challenge this recovery on legal and factual sufficiency grounds and on\nthe theory of Statute of Frauds.\n\n\nA. Standard of Review\nNeither of the parties argue that the terms of the J.O.A. are ambiguous, they merely disagree as\nto the form of consent necessary under the J.O.A. to accept the proposal of a *133 new well.\nHunt/Hill argue that the J.O.A. is subject to the Statute of Frauds because it involves contracts for\nthe sale of real estate. Heritage contends that the ultimate question regarding this issue is whether\nHunt/Hill consented to participate in the 22–3 well. In arguing this point, Heritage urges that\nunder the requirements of the J.O.A., the parties can orally consent to participate in drilling a well\nand, even if the J.O.A. is subject to the Statute of Frauds, the oral agreement comes within the\npartial performance exception to the Statute of Frauds and is therefore enforceable. Because of the\nunambiguous language of the J.O.A., we must disagree with Heritage.\n\n\nB.

All the provisions of\nthe agreement should be considered and construed together to ascertain the meaning and effect\nof the entire instrument. Steeger v. Beard Drilling, Inc., 371 S.W.2d 684, 688 (Tex.1963); Eagle\nLife Ins. Co. v. G.I.C. Ins. Co., 697 S.W.2d 648, 651 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1985, writ ref'd\nn.r.e.). Furthermore, a contract is to be interpreted in accordance with its plain language. Eagle\nLife Ins. Co., 697 S.W.2d at 650.\n\nAs stated by Heritage in their brief, consent to participate in a proposed operation is governed by\nArticle VI.B.1. of the 22 J.O.A. which reads:\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 47\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n\n            1. Proposed Operations: Should any party hereto desire to drill any well on the\n            Contract Area other than the well provided for in Article VI.A., ... the party\n            desiring to drill ... such a well shall give the other parties written notice of the\n            proposed operation, specifying the work to be performed, the location, proposed\n            depth, objection formation and the estimated cost of the operation. The parties\n            receiving such a notice shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice\n            within which to notify the party wishing to do the work whether they elect to\n            participate in the cost of the proposed operation. If a drilling rig is on location,\n            notice of a proposal to rework, plug back or drill deeper may be given by\n            telephone and the response shall be limited to forty-eight (48) hours.... Any\n            notice or response given by telephone shall be promptly confirmed in writing.\n            [Emphasis added].\n\nThis portion of the Article is clearly written in accordance with Article XII. of the J.O.A. which\nexpressly requires that “notices authorized or required between the parties and required by any of\nthe provisions of this agreement, unless otherwise specifically provided, shall be given in writing\nby mail or telegram....” [Emphasis added].\n\n\n1. Consent.\n[85] Heritage argues that the case of C & C Partners v. Sun Exploration and Prod.Co., 783\nS.W.2d 707 714–15 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1989, writ denied) stands for the proposition that written\nconsent to participate in a well is not required under the terms of a joint operating agreement. 2\nThe Court in C & C Partners held that because that contract was unambiguous and did not specify\na particular form of consent, the Court was required to give effect to the intention of the parties\nas expressed in their writing. C & C Partners, 783 S.W.2d at 714–15. That Court then found that\noral consent was sufficient to obligate the parties to participate in the well. Id. at 715.\n\nThe Dallas Court's conclusion is, however, only dicta, as the question in that case was whether\nor not consent had to be evidenced by means of a AFE. We certainly agree that consent or non-\nconsent to participate in the drilling of a new well does not need to be in any particular form;\nhowever, we disagree that it can be oral. The C & C Partners Court concluded that the contract\nprovisions only required written confirmation of responses to telephonic notices, and that since\nconfirmation of consent was distinct and separate *134 from consent, there was no requirement\nof a writing. This logic fails for two reasons. First, telephonic notices and responses are limited by\nthe operating agreement to “rework, plug back or drill deeper” operations and then only when the\ndrill rig is on location. Article VI.B.1. Second, Article XII of the operating agreement provides:\n\n            All notices authorized or required between the parties and required by any of\n            the provisions of this agreement, unless otherwise specifically provided, shall\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  48\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n            be given in writing by mail or telegram, postage or charges prepaid, or by telex\n            or telecopier....\n\nWe find Article XII to plainly require written consent or non-consent to a proposal to drill a\nsubsequent well.\n\n\n2. Proposal.\nEven if oral consent to the drilling proposal were authorized, Heritage's oral proposal to drill a\nsubstitute well for the failing 22–2 well failed to satisfy the initial proposal requirements under\nthe 22 J.O.A. Heritage was required, under Article XII. of the J.O.A., to propose the drilling of\nthe new well by notice in writing, specifying the details of its development as required by Article\nVI.B.1. Such an oral proposal also violates the 22 J.O.A. by (1) proposing the well to fewer than\nall of the parties to the J.O.A., and (2) by failing to specify the details surrounding the development\nof the new well including location, depth, objective formation, and estimated cost.\n\nThus, Appellees' oral proposal for drilling the 22–3 well violated the provisions of the J.O.A.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the alleged oral agreement to pay the 22–3 well costs in exchange for\nstopping drilling the 22–2 well fails as a matter of law.\n\n\nC. Statute of Frauds.\nHunt/Hill have also asserted that the J.O.A. is subject to the Statute of Frauds because it involves\ncontracts for the sale of real estate. Heritage counters that even if the Statute of Frauds applies, the\noral agreement is enforceable under the partial performance exception. We believe that Statute of\nFrauds does apply and the oral agreement does not come within the partial performance exception\nto the doctrine because Heritage could not have relied on the oral agreement to its detriment.\n\n\n1. The Rule.\n [86] [87] [88] Generally, mineral interests and oil and gas leaseholds are treated as real\nproperty interests. Cherokee Water Co. v, Forderhause, 641 S.W.2d 522, 525 (Tex.1982); Mobil\nExploration & Producing U.S., Inc. v. W.R. McDonald, 810 S.W.2d 887, 890 (Tex.App.—\nBeaumont 1991, writ denied). As such, they are subject to the rules relating to real property\nincluding the Statute of Frauds. TEX.BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 26.01 (Vernon 1987); EP\nOperating Co. v. MJC Energy Co., 883 S.W.2d 263, 267 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1994, writ\ndenied); Vela v. Pennzoil Producing Co., 723 S.W.2d 199, 206 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1986,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.). Specifically, the Statute of Frauds has been held to require that oil and gas leases\nand contracts for their transfer be in writing. EP Operating Co., 883 S.W.2d at 267; Vela, 723\nS.W.2d at 206. The joint operating agreement, in this case, also requires compliance with the\nStatute of Frauds. There are numerous sections within the agreement which make the Section 22\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   49\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nleases “subject to” its terms and vice versa. Specifically, the 22 J.O.A. states under Article VIII.A.\nthat the “leases covered by this agreement, insofar as they embrace acreage in the Contract Area,\nshall not be surrendered in whole or in part unless all parties consent thereto.” Thus, the 22 J.O.A.\nnecessarily governs the transfer of interests in the oil and gas leases subject to the agreement. The\nincorporation by reference of the lease interests makes the J.O.A. a part of the real property leases.\nSee S & D Group, Inc. v. Talamas, 710 S.W.2d 680, 683 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1986, writ\nref'd n.r.e.). Thus, both agreements must be read and construed together. Id.; Estrada v. River Oaks\nBank & Trust Co., 550 S.W.2d 719, 726 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1977, writ ref'd\nn.r.e.); Volunteer State Life Ins. Co. v. Snipes, 209 S.W.2d 935, 936 (Tex.Civ.App.—San Antonio\n1948, no writ). As such, the *135 leases and the J.O.A. are subject to the Statute of Frauds.\n\n [89] Finally, the oral agreement which is the basis for Heritage's breach of contract claim involves\nmore than just the obligation of Hunt/Hill to pay a share of the costs of the 22–3 well. Because\nthe objective of the 22–3 well was to reach the Ellenburger formation at a depth of approximately\n22,000 feet, and since the 22 J.O.A. was limited to maximum depth of 20,000 feet, the oral\nagreement would also constitute a material amendment of the J.O.A. depth limitations requiring\nit to be in writing. Dracopoulas v. Rachal, 411 S.W.2d 719, 721 (Tex.1967); Lone Star Steel\nCo. v. Reeder, 407 S.W.2d 28, 31 (Tex.Civ.App.—Texarkana 1966, writ ref'd n.r.e.). There is no\nevidence that the parties made a written, or oral, modification of the depth limitation as contained\nin the J.O.A. Consequently, the Statute of Frauds bars enforcement of the this agreement and\nprecludes any recovery for its breach.\n\n\n2. Partial Performance Exception.\n [90] [91] The Statute of Frauds will not bar the enforcement of an oral contract where there\nis partial performance by the party seeking to enforce the contract. Leon Ltd. v. Albuquerque\nCommons Partnership, 862 S.W.2d 693, 702 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1993, no writ); Wiley v.\nBertelsen, 770 S.W.2d 878, 882 (Tex.App.—Texarkana 1989, no writ); Oak Cliff Realty Corp.\nv. Mauzy, 354 S.W.2d 693, 695 (Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1962, writ ref'd n.r.e.). However, in\norder to take the oral contract out of the Statute of Frauds, one party must perform in reliance upon\nthe contract so that failure to enforce the contract would result in a “virtual fraud” as one party\nhas incurred a substantial detriment and the other has reaped an unearned benefit. Central Power\nand Light Co. v. Del Mar Conservation Dist., 594 S.W.2d 782, 790 (Tex.Civ.App.—San Antonio\n1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Manzell v. Hightower, 159 S.W.2d 552, 554 (Tex.Civ.App.—Texarkana\n1942, no writ).\n\n [92] The oral agreement upon which Heritage premises its recovery was entered into in May\nof 1987. As early as September 1987, the Hunts had advised Heritage that they wanted Heritage\nto bring operations to a stand still and not conduct any further drilling activities. In a September\n28, 1987 letter from Hunt/Hill, Heritage was notified by the Hunts that a “vote” of the Non–\nOperators had been taken and that Heritage had been removed as Operator. Heritage was further\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 50\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nadvised that Tribal Drilling would be taking over operations and that Heritage should perform\nonly “routine and necessary production, operating, and maintenance operations” until that time.\nOn October 26, 1987, Heritage held an Operator's meeting discussing the 22–3 well. The Hunts,\nin attendance, contested the drilling of the 22–3 well and asserted that no wells should be drilled\npending Heritage's sale of its own interests in the wells. In November, the Hunts' attorney advised\nHeritage that the 22–3 well, was outside the contract area as contemplated by the J.O.A. because\nit was proposed to a depth of 22,000 feet. Finally, on December 18, 1987, Tribal Drilling filed an\naction in Dallas County seeking judgment that Heritage owned no interest in the contract area and\nrequesting a temporary restraining order to cease Heritage's operations. On December 28, 1987,\nHeritage began drilling operations on the 22–3 well.\n\nIn light of the numerous repudiations of the alleged oral agreement between the Hunts and\nHeritage, as well as the initiation of drilling operations on the 22–3 well after suit was brought\nto enjoin Heritage from such drilling, we do not find that Heritage's performance under the oral\ncontract was done in reliance upon the oral contract. Consequently, there is no performance such\nthat refusal to enforce the agreement would result in a “virtual fraud” upon Heritage as its actions,\nas a matter of law, were not done in good faith reliance upon the May oral agreement. In light of\nour determination that the performance exception to the Statute of Frauds does not apply in this\ninstance, we find that Heritage's claim for breach of the 22 J.O.A. is barred as a matter of law.\n\nPoint of Error 54b is sustained and because of this resolution, we do not address the remaining\nPoints of Error 54a, c, and 55.\n\n\n\n                                                         *136 X.\n\n\n                                        Remainder of Points of Error.\n\n\n        Points of Error 21, 43a, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 56, 57, 58, 59,60, 61, 62, 63.\n\nA. Exclusion of Findings of the Railroad Commission.\nHunt/Hill challenge the trial court's refusal to admit into evidence or judicially notice the Railroad\nCommission's Proposal for Decision on Heritage's Field Designation Application. At trial, Hunt/\nHill admitted into evidence the Texas Railroad Commission's Final Order which denied Heritage's\nrequest for authorization from the Commission to complete the 22–3 well in the same reservoir\nas the 22–2 well. The Commission's Final Order adopted as its own the findings of fact and\nconclusions of law of the Examiner's Proposal for Decision (“PFD”). The PFD stated in Findings\nof Fact 33 that Heritage intended the 22–3 well to be a test of the Silurian interval already being\nproduced by the 22–2 well.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 51\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n\nHunt/Hill attempted to enter into evidence the entire PFD, or alternatively, Findings of Fact 33.\nThe trial court refused to admit either. Hunt/Hill then requested that the trial court take judicial\nnotice of the PFD; the request was denied. Hunt/Hill now contend that the excluded evidence\nconclusively establishes that Heritage breached its duties under the Section 22 J.O.A. and that the\nRailroad Commission's findings of fact give rise to collateral estoppel.\n\n\n1. Trial Court's Refusal to Admit PFD into Evidence.\n [93] [94] Admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter within the trial court's discretion.\nSyndex Corp. v. Dean, 820 S.W.2d 869, 873 (Tex.App.—Austin 1991, writ denied); Dudley v.\nHumana Hosp. Corp., 817 S.W.2d 124, 126 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, no writ). To\nobtain a reversal of judgment based upon a trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence, the\nappellant must show: (1) that the trial court abused its discretion in making the decision; and (2)\nthat the error was reasonably calculated to cause and probably did cause rendition of an improper\njudgment. Gee v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 765 S.W.2d 394, 396 (Tex.1989); TEX.R.APP.P.\n81(b), 49 TEX.B.J. 561 (Tex.1986, superseded 1997). Because it is impossible to prescribe a\nspecific test for making the latter determination, it is a “judgment call entrusted to the sound\ndiscretion and good senses of the reviewing court” which must be made by an evaluation of the\nentire case. Lorusso v. Members Mut. Ins. Co., 603 S.W.2d 818, 821 (Tex.1980).\n\n [95] It has been held that when evidence is sharply conflicting and the case is hotly contested,\nany error of law by the trial court will be reversible error under Rule of Appellate Procedure\n81(b)(1), 49 TEX.B.J. 561 (Tex.1986, superseded 1997). Lorusso, 603 S.W.2d at 821; Nix v. H.R.\nManagement Co., 733 S.W.2d 573, 576 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.)(reversing\nhotly contested case for erroneous admission of evidence). But, the Supreme Court has also\nstated that error in admitting evidence will not require reversal unless that evidence controlled the\njudgment. Gee, 765 S.W.2d at 396. If other competent evidence of the fact in question appears in\nthe record, improper admission of evidence will not constitute reversible error. Id. at 397. Thus,\nevidentiary rulings will not cause reversal unless the appellant demonstrates that the whole case\nturns on the evidence improperly admitted or excluded. Superior Derrick Servs., Inc. v. Anderson,\n831 S.W.2d 868, 876 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, writ denied); Shenandoah Assoc. v.\nJ & K Properties, Inc., 741 S.W.2d 470, 493 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1987, writ denied).\n\n [96] The record reflects that the facts contained within the PFD were introduced at different times\nthrough the trial by various witnesses. Furthermore, the subject matter of Findings of Fact 33 was\nthe basis of testimony by more than one witness at trial and evidence contradicting Findings of\nFact 33 was even introduced. Findings of Fact 33 and the PFD, were therefore, merely cumulative\nevidence and the trial court committed no error in excluding it as evidence at trial. Hunt/Hill's\nPoints of Error 59a and 59c are overruled.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                52\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n\n *137 2. Trial Court's Refusal to Take Judicial Notice of the PFD.\n [97] Texas Rule of Civil Evidence § 201 imposes a mandatory obligation upon a trial court\nto judicially notice facts: (1) if properly requested by a party; (2) if the court is supplied with\nthe appropriate information; and (3) if the fact is of a kind that may properly be noticed.\nTEX.R.CIV.EVID. 201(b) & (d). Since it is undisputed that Hunt/Hill properly requested judicial\nnotice and supplied the court with the appropriate information, we need only address whether\nthe PFD of the Railroad Commission was the proper subject matter for judicial notice. A\njudicially noticed fact must be one that is not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either:\n(1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court; or (2) capable of\naccurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be\nquestioned. TEX.R.CIV.EVID. 201(b). Matters that may be judicially noticed are often divided\ninto three categories: adjudicative facts; legislative facts; and law. 2 Kenneth S. Brown, et al.,\nMCCORMICK ON EVIDENCE § 328, at 385–88 (John W. Strong ed., 4th ed.1992). Adjudicative\nfacts are those to which the law is applied in the process of adjudication. Thus, when a court or an\nagency finds facts concerning the immediate parties, including who did what, where, when, how,\nand with what motive or intent, the court or agency is performing an adjudicative function, and the\nfacts are called adjudicative facts. 2 Kenneth S. Brown, et al., MCCORMICK ON EVIDENCE\nat 385.\n\n [98] The Railroad Commission conducted a five day hearing where the parties were represented\nby counsel and witnesses testified to the circumstances concerning Heritage's application to drill\nthe 22–3 well. After the contested evidentiary proceeding, the Commission made its findings of\nfact and conclusions of law and executed a final order prohibiting the drilling of the 22–3 well.\nThe final order and its accompanying PFD were duly published and are matters of public record.\nAs such, the trial court erred in refusing to take judicial notice of the published order and PFD of\nthe Railroad Commission. See Office of Pub. Util. Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm'n of Texas, 878\nS.W.2d 598, 600 (Tex.1994)(holding that the court of appeals erred by failing to take judicial\nnotice of readily determinable facts contained in a published PUC order). However, because of\nthe cumulative nature of the evidence contained in the PFD, we find that the trial court's error\nin refusing to judicially notice the PFD constitutes harmless error. There was other competent\nevidence of Heritage's intentions of drilling the 22–3 well such that the omitted evidence could\nnot have controlled the judgment. Point of Error 60a is overruled.\n\n\n3. Collateral Estoppel.\n[99] Hunt/Hill argue that Findings of Fact 33 of the Railroad Commission PFD collaterally estops\nHeritage from denying that it intended the 22–3 well to be a test of the Silurian interval already\nbeing produced by the 22–2 well. This fact, Hunt/Hill aver, establishes that Heritage breached the\n22 J.O.A. because Heritage was attempting to complete the 22–3 well in the same source of supply\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               53\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nas the 22–2 well without the mutual consent of all parties to the J.O.A. Heritage's removal as\nOperator of Section 22 would therefore have been warranted because of this breach of the J.O.A.\n\n [100] [101] Collateral estoppel is an affirmative defense and as such, the party asserting such\na defense has the burden of pleading and proving its elements. Williams v. National Mort. Co.,\n903 S.W.2d 398, 401 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1995, writ denied). Under a plea of collateral estoppel,\nessential issues of fact previously determined and adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction are\nbinding in a subsequent action between the same parties. Bonniwell v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 663\nS.W.2d 816, 818 (Tex.1984). The doctrine not only applies to judgments but also to the decisions\nof an administrative agency where the administrative agency has acted in a judicial capacity and\nresolved disputed issues of fact properly before it where the parties had adequate opportunity to\nlitigate. Muckelroy v. Richardson Indep. Sch. Dist., 884 S.W.2d 825, 830 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1994,\nwrit denied) (citing *138 Bryant v. L.H. Moore Canning Co., 509 S.W.2d 432, 434 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—Corpus Christi), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 845, 95 S.Ct. 79, 42 L.Ed.2d 74 [1974] ); Railroad\nComm'n v. Phillips, 364 S.W.2d 408, 411 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1963, no writ). Finally, the issue\nof the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel is a question of law for the court. Price v.\nTexas Employers' Ins. Ass'n, 782 S.W.2d 938, 940 (Tex.App.—Tyler 1989, no writ).\n\nIn the instant case, Hunt/Hill urge that they pled in their answer to plaintiff's petition that the\nRailroad Commission's findings of fact gave rise to collateral estoppel. However, the record before\nus is void of any motion for summary judgment or motion to dismiss the issues previously decided\nby the Commission on the basis of res judicata or collateral estoppel. Therefore, there is no order\nfrom the trial court denying such motion and preserving such error. Furthermore, during trial,\nHunt/Hill attempted to prove the admissibility of the Commission's Order and PFD apparently\non the basis of relevancy to the proceedings, not on the basis of collateral estoppel. Bearing the\nburden of establishing their affirmative defense of collateral estoppel, Hunt/Hill were obligated to\nplead and prove its elements. Having failed to obtain a ruling, not on the admissibility as evidence,\nbut on the issue of collateral estoppel of the issues litigated before the Railroad Commission, we\nfind there can be no error in this regard.\n\n [102] Moreover, any error in failing to admit into evidence, or judicially notice, the Commission's\nPFD is harmless error. Findings of Fact 33 specifically found that Heritage intended that the 22–\n3 well be a test of the Silurian interval. Hunt/Hill contend that this “intention” finding establishes\nthat Heritage breached the provision of the J.O.A. which provides that “without the mutual consent\nof all parties, no well shall be completed in or produced from a source of supply from which a well\nlocated elsewhere on the Contract Area is producing....” [Emphasis added]. However, Findings of\nFact 23 of the PFD found that “it was never the intention of Heritage Resources, Inc., to complete\nthe No. 22–3 well in the Crittendon (Silurian) Field. Heritage knew that the existence of the No. 22–\n2 well in that field on a 640 acre lease prevented a regular permit for the No. 22–3 well.” [Emphasis\nadded]. Thus, Findings of Fact 23 clearly negates Hunt/Hill's position as to Heritage's breach of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                54\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nthe J.O.A. provision. Accordingly, we find that any error by the trial court in failing to admit the\nPFD was harmless. Points of Error 59b and 60b are overruled.\n\n\nB. Declaratory relief by Hill that:\nHunt/Hill contend in Points of Error 48 thru 52 that the trial court erred in awarding Heritage\ndeclaratory relief and denying Hunt/Hill's requested declaratory relief. The only declaratory relief\ngranted by the trial court was as follows:\n\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED and DECLARED that Heritage Resources, Inc. has since on or\n   before December 17, 1987 owned an interest in Sections 21 and 22 of Block C–23, PSL Survey,\n   Winkler County, Texas and that such interest was sufficient for Heritage to serve as operator of\n   those Sections under the Joint Operating Agreements to those Sections. (“Declaration One”)\n\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED and DECLARED that Heritage Resources, Inc. has not breached\n   any of its duties under the Joint Operating Agreements to Sections 21 and 22, Block–23, PSL\n   Survey, Winkler County, Texas. (“Declaration Two”)\n\nHunt/Hill challenge the trial court's granting of declaratory relief claiming that the court erred\nin submitting questions of law, or questions which were the subject of undisputed evidence, to\nthe jury. Specifically, Hunt/Hill challenge five of the jury's findings upon which such declaratory\nrelief was premised. First, Hunt/Hill challenge the jury's finding in response to Questions 1 and 3,\nthat Heritage did not breach any of its duties under the Section 21 and 22 J.O.A.s before or after\nSeptember 1987. Secondly, Hunt/Hill challenge the jury's finding in response to Question 8, that\nthe 22–3 well was covered by the Section 22 J.O.A. Thirdly, Hunt/Hill challenge the jury's finding\nin response to Question 11, that the Defendant's failure to comply with the Section 22 J.O.A. was\nnot excused. Lastly, Hunt/Hill challenge the *139 jury's finding in response to Question 46, that\nHeritage owned an interest in the Section 21 and 22 Contract Areas on or before December 17,\n1987.\n\nA disagreement over the interpretation of a contract clause does not render the clause ambiguous.\nFirst City Nat'l Bank of Midland v. Concord Oil Co., 808 S.W.2d 133, 136 (Tex.App.—El Paso\n1991, no writ). When the parties disagree over the meaning of an unambiguous contract, the\ncourt must determine the parties' intent from the agreement itself, not from the parties' present\ninterpretation. Sun Oil Co. (Delaware) v. Madeley, 626 S.W.2d 726, 731–732 (Tex.1981); First\nCity Nat'l Bank of Midland, 808 S.W.2d at 136; KMI Continental Offshore Prod. Co. v. ACF\nPetroleum Co., 746 S.W.2d 238, 241 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ denied). Where a\ncontract is unambiguous it need only be enforced as a matter of law. R & P Enters., 596 S.W.2d at\n518. In construing an unambiguous contract, a court should attempt to harmonize and give effect to\nall provisions so that none is rendered meaningless.

Declaration One—Interest to Serve as Operator.\n [103] In order to properly serve as operator under the J.O.A., the operator must own an “interest”\nin the contract area. However, neither the Section 21 J.O.A. nor the Section 22 J.O.A. contains\na definition of the term “interest.” Hunt/Hill argue that Heritage had to possess a cost bearing\ninterest. Heritage argues record title is sufficient. Thus, the issue becomes whether record title\nqualifies as an interest sufficient to satisfy the J.O.A.\n\n [104] Interpretation of an unambiguous contract term is a question of law for the trial court. City\nof Pinehurst v. Spooner Addition Water Co., 432 S.W.2d 515, 518 (Tex.1968); C & C Partners,\n783 S.W.2d at 715. Consequently, it was improper for the trial court to submit the question to\nthe jury. In reviewing questions of law, we grant no deference to the judgment of the trial court,\nrather we independently review the decision. In the Matter of Humphreys, 880 S.W.2d 402, 404\n(Tex.1994).\n\nHunt/Hill had the burden to prove that Heritage did not own an interest at a time that two or more\nworking interest owners voted for its removal. Exhibit A to the 22 J.O.A. contains a listing of\nall “Interests of the Parties.” Within this listing are seventeen names and two columns of percent\ninterests labeled “Before Payout Working Interest” and “After Payout Working Interest.” Heritage\nis at the very top of the list with a significant percent interest before and after payout. Thus, at the\ntime of the signing of the J.O.A., Heritage was disclosed as an interest owner. Hunt/Hill presented\nno evidence that Heritage's entire interest under the Section 22 J.O.A. had been transferred or\nconveyed after the signing of the J.O.A.\n\nCiting to several property cases, Hunt/Hill argue that there is a distinction between “record title”\nand “ownership.” However, this argument is futile in light of unequivocal trial testimony. Hunt/\nHill's own attorney, Michael Nugent, testified that by signing the J.O.A., Heritage assumed a\ncost-bearing interest which obligated them to pay a proportionate share of the costs of drilling\nwells on Section 22. Moreover, there was expert testimony from Marvin Wigley, a member of the\ncommittee of the American Association of Petroleum Landmen that drafted the A.A.P.L. Form\n610, used for the Section 21 and 22 J.O.A.s, that record title is a sufficient interest to satisfy the\nownership interest requirement for operator status under the J.O.A.\n\nThe sum total of Hunt/Hill evidence in support of their contention that Heritage had to possess\na cost bearing interest is the argument that without such a requirement the operator would have\nno incentive to minimize costs and that non-operators would be left unprotected. In light of the\ntestimony of Hunt/Hill's own attorney stating that Heritage did possess a cost-bearing interest,\nHunt/Hill's argument must fail. Furthermore, given the fact that Heritage was listed as a working\ninterest owner, and that expert testimony revealed that record title is sufficient under the J.O.A., we\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   56\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nconclude, as a *140 matter of law, that record title is sufficient to satisfy the interest requirement\nfor operator status under the Section 21 and 22 J.O.A.s.\n\n\n2. Declaration Two—Breach of the J.O.A.\n [105] [106] [107] [108] The jury found that Heritage had not breached the J.O.A. The trial\ncourt entered a declaratory judgment that “Heritage ... has not breached any of its duties....”\nWhether or not Heritage did in fact breach any of its duties under the J.O.A. was a question of fact\nand was therefore, properly submitted to the jury. The jury found that Heritage had not breached\nthe J.O.A.s. In a suit for declaratory judgment “a court ... has power to declare rights, status, and\nother legal relations....” TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 37.003. Furthermore, a trial\ncourt having jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment has the power to determine issues of\nfact. United Servs. Life Ins. Co. v. Delaney, 396 S.W.2d 855, 858 (Tex.1965); Bexar–Medina–\nAtascosa Counties Water Control and Improvement Dist. No.1 v. Medina Lake Protection Ass'n,\n640 S.W.2d 778, 779 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.). However, the power to\ndetermine an issue of fact does not concomitantly carry with it the power to render such a finding\nof fact as a declaratory judgment. The determination of whether a party has breached a contract,\nwhile affecting a party's rights or status, is not a declaration of a right or status and therefore, is\nnot the proper subject of a declaratory judgment. The only matter that was to be resolved was\nthe purely factual question of whether or not Heritage breached the J.O.A. If a factual dispute is\nthe only issue to be resolved, a declaratory judgment is not the proper remedy. Emmco Ins. Co.\nv. Burrows, 419 S.W.2d 665, 671 (Tex.Civ.App.—Tyler 1967, no writ); Lincoln v. Harvey, 191\nS.W.2d 764, 766 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas 1945, no writ). Accordingly, we find that Declaration\nTwo was not the proper subject matter for a declaratory judgment.\n\n [109] Hunt/Hill next contend that there was legally insufficient evidence, or alternatively, it was\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence, for the jury to find that Heritage did\nnot breach any of its duties under the J.O.A.s. Hunt/Hill proffer three instances which they claim\nunequivocally establish Heritage's breach of the J.O.A.s. First, Hunt/Hill argue that Heritage's\ninsolvency resulted in its automatic deemed resignation. However, Hunt/Hill drafted the jury\nquestions regarding Heritage's status as Operator. Broad form questions were used and Hunt/Hill\ndid not request an issue on Heritage's bankruptcy as it affected its status as Operator. Therefore,\nany error is waived. See TEX.R.APP.P. 52(a), 49 TEX.B.J. 561 (Tex.1986, superseded 1997).\nAdditionally, there is evidence that there was never a vote to remove Heritage as Operator during\npendency in bankruptcy which is required for removal under the J.O.A.\n\nSecond, Hunt/Hill contend that Heritage engaged in wrongful billing practices. However, there is\nsubstantial evidence that the Hunts and Hills knew of and agreed to “vendor deals.” Furthermore,\nexpert testimony revealed that the J.O.A. would not prohibit “vendor deals.” Finally, Hunt/Hill\nargue that Heritage failed to obtain the requisite consent for the perforation of the 21–1 well. In\nsupport of this argument, Hunt/Hill claim that there had to be written authorization. Noting our\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 57\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nprevious discussion on breach of contract, written consent was required for the proliferation of the\n21–1 well. However, there was some evidence presented on this issue indicating that a request was\nmade by the Hunts for Heritage to conduct further activity on the 21–1 well. Thus, considering\nall three points of dispute, we cannot hold that the jury's finding that Heritage did not breach its\nduties under the J.O.A. was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. There was\nsufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Heritage did not breach its duties under the\nJ.O.A. Therefore, the trial court was proper in granting Heritage's declaratory relief with respect\nto Declaration One but not with respect to Declaration Two. Furthermore, in light of this analysis,\nthe trial court was correct in denying all of Hunt/Hill's requests for declaratory relief relating\nto Heritage's performance as Operator. Also, due to our disposition of the other points of error\nregarding the 22–2 well and the Section 22 J.O.A. and our analysis of the other issues of *141\ndeclaratory judgment, we cannot find that the trial court erred in denying Hunt/Hill other requests\nfor declaratory relief as they relate to the 22–2 well. Points of Error 48, 49, 50, 51, and 52 are\noverruled.\n\n\nC. Recovery Against Distributees of A.G. Hill and the Hill Group.\nHunt/Hill further complain of the trial court's granting of relief against A.G. Hill's successors in\ninterest on two grounds. First, Hunt/Hill contend that as of the filing of the May 1, 1992 First\nAmended Petition, the statute of limitations on all claims asserted against these defendants had\nrun and that therefore, any recovery was precluded as a matter of law. Secondly, Hunt/Hill argue\nthat these parties were not properly substituted into the lawsuit. A.G. Hill was a named defendant\nin Heritage's original petition filed on December 18, 1987. Mr. Hill died in June of 1988, during\nthe pendency of this litigation. On May 1, 1992, Heritage added Margaret Hunt Hill, Executrix\nof the Estate of A.G. Hill, and the Margaret Hunt Hill Martial Trust, the Albert G. Hill, III Trust,\nthe Heather Victoria Hill Trust, the Elisa Margaret Hill Trust, the Michael Bush Wisenbaker, Jr.\nTrust, the Wesley Hill Wisenbaker Trust, Cody McArthur Wikert Trust, and the Margretta Hill\nWikert Trust, as defendants in its first amended petition as A.G. Hill's successors-in-interest.\n\n\n1. Statute of Limitations.\n [110] Heritage's original petition was sufficient to put in issue a cause of action against A.G.\nHill for fraud. The fraud upon which Heritage sought recovery was the alleged May 1987 oral\nagreement whereby the Hunts agreed to pay their share of the drilling costs of the 22–3 well. Since\nthe cause of action preceded the filing of Heritage's original petition, it was therefore a ripe claim\nand the trial court was properly vested with subject matter jurisdiction as of the date of filing the\nOriginal Petition. Accordingly, Heritage's first amended petition, which was based in part upon\nthis same transaction relates back to the original petition in accordance with TEX.CIV.PRAC. &\nREM.CODE ANN. § 16.068. Therefore, Heritage's recovery against these defendants, if properly\nsubstituted as A.G. Hill's successors in interest, will not be precluded on the basis of statute of\nlimitations.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                58\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n\n2. Proper Parties.\n [111] Hunt/Hill next argue that there is absolutely no evidence that either the distributees of A.G.\nHill or anyone else in the Hill Group, other than Virgil St. Clair and A.G. Hill, engaged in any\nactionable misconduct and that therefore, recovery against them is improper. However, with regard\nto the joinder of A.G. Hill's distributees as proper party defendants, Hunt/Hill did not file a Verified\nAnswer denying liability in the capacity in which they were being sued or asserting the existence\nof a defect in parties. TEX.R.CIV.P. 93. Additionally, the parties voluntarily entered the lawsuit by\njoining in the counterclaim. Furthermore, Hunt/Hill wholly failed to object to their inclusion in the\njury questions. Consequently, any error based upon this theory is waived by failure of the parties\nto object. TEX.R.APP.P. 52(a), 49 TEX.B.J. 561 (Tex.1986, superseded 1997); Lemons v. EMW\nMfg. Co., 747 S.W.2d 372, 373 (Tex.1988). Hunt/Hills' Points of Error 61a and 61b are overruled.\n\nLikewise, the record reflects that Heritage's Second Amended Petition alleged that A.G. Hill and\nVirgil St. Clair were the apparent ostensible agents of the entire Hill group. The Hill Group's\nanswer failed to deny any of these agency allegations. Furthermore, Hunt/Hill did not object to any\njury question or jury issue which included them as defendants on the grounds of lack of evidence\nof agency, or any other grounds. Consequently, any error based upon this theory is waived by\nthe parties' failure to object. TEX.R.APP.P. 52(a), 49 TEX.B.J. 561 (Tex.1986, superseded 1997);\nLemons, 747 S.W.2d at 373. Accordingly, Hunt/Hill's Points of Error 56, 57, and 58 are overruled.\n\n\nD. Duplication of Damages.\nHunt/Hill allege in Points of Error 21 and 43a that the trial court erred in overruling their motions\nfor new trial, motions to disregard jury answers, and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and\nin entering *142 judgment against them because the damages awarded by the jury in Questions\n21, 25, 32, 37a, and 37b are duplicative of one another. In light of our holding that Heritage is\nnot entitled to recover on any of its tortious interference or slander of title claims, with the sole\nexception of the claims regarding the Oxford transaction, and in light of our disposition of Point\nof Error 28b, we need not address Points of Error 21 and 43a.\n\n\nE. Damages Awarded to Van Oliver, Trustee.\nIn Point of Error 62, Hunt/Hill urge that the trial court erred in awarding damages in favor of the\nIntervenor Van Oliver, Trustee because the Trustee's claims and damage award are derivative of\nHeritage's claims and damages. It appears from the record that all parties to the action stipulated to\nan agreement whereby Van Oliver, Trustee, for the benefit of certain trade creditors of Heritage,\nwould receive 15 percent of any award Heritage received in the suit. Appellees agree that\nthe Trustee's recovery is derivative of Heritage's recovery and as such, is directly portional to\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  59\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\nHeritage's award. It therefore appears that the judgment must be reformed to reflect that Van\nOliver's award is to be recovered from Heritage's award. We sustain Point of Error 62.\n\n\nF. Seven Falls Company.\n [112] Hunt/Hill claim in Point of Error 63 that the trial court erred in entering judgment against\nSeven Falls Company and in denying the corporation's motion to strike all claims against it. Seven\nFalls Company was first named as a party to the suit by the Hill Group's counterclaim filed August\n17, 1992. However, it is undisputed that Seven Falls was not named as a party in either the First\nAmended Counterclaim or Second Amended Counterclaim filed by the Hill Group Hunt/Hill on\nAugust 19, 1992 and September 22, 1992, respectively. Appellees argue that Seven Falls remained\na party after the filing of the Hill Group's counterclaim on August 17, 1992, despite the omission\nof Seven Falls from the first and second amended counterclaims because Seven Falls did not file\nnonsuit after that date.\n\nUnder Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 65, an amended pleading supersedes and supplants the\noriginal pleading. In Burton v. Bridges, 641 S.W.2d 635, 637 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1982, writ ref'd\nn.r.e.), we held that under Rule 65 “[p]arties to a suit are just as effectively dismissed from a suit\nby omitting their names from an amended pleading as where a formal dismissal order is entered.”\nSee Evans v. Hoag, 711 S.W.2d 744, 746 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1986, writ ref'd n.r.e.);\nDingman v. Spengler, 371 S.W.2d 416, 423–424 (Tex.Civ.App.—El Paso 1963, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\nThus, as Hunt/Hill have correctly argued, Seven Falls Corporation was not a party to the action\nonce the first amended counterclaim omitted them as a defendant.\n\nUpon filing their second amended original petition and original answer, Heritage included Seven\nFalls as a defendant. However, Hunt/Hill argue that Seven Falls was never served with process.\nHeritage does not contend that Seven Falls was served with process but instead relies on Seven\nFalls' voluntary joinder in the suit by way of the original counterclaim. Because we find that the\nomission of Seven Falls from the amended counterclaims effectively dismissed them from the suit,\nit was Appellees' burden to serve Seven Falls with citation in accordance with Texas Rule of Civil\nProcedure 99. See Evans, 711 S.W.2d at 746. Appellees failed to comply with such rules. Hunt/\nHill made a motion to strike all claims against Seven Falls Company and obtained an unfavorable\nruling from the trial judge. However, regardless of the title of the motion, Hunt/Hill substantively\nargued the improper joinder of Seven Falls as a defendant. See Cherry v. North Am. Lloyds of\nTexas, 770 S.W.2d 4, 6 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, writ denied)(opin. on motion for\nreh'g). For the foregoing reasons, we sustain Hunt/Hill's Point of Error 63 and find that the trial\ncourt erred in denying the motion to strike and in entering judgment against Seven Falls Company.\n\n\nG. Attorney's Fees.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 60\n\fHill v. Heritage Resources, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 89 (1997)\n\n\n\n [113] [114] Hunt/Hill challenge the trial court's award of attorney's fees in Points of Error 45,\n46, and 47. The trial court awarded *143 Heritage attorney's fees based upon a percentage of\nHeritage's total recovery at trial. There is no common law right to attorney's fees. Instead, the\nrecovery of attorney's fees must be authorized by statute or contract. Dallas Cent. Appraisal Dist.\nv. Seven Invest. Co., 835 S.W.2d 75, 77 (Tex.1992); New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Texas Indus.,\nInc., 414 S.W.2d 914, 915 (Tex.1967). Additionally, if a case involves more than one claim, then\nonly those fees attributable to the claim falling within the scope of such statute or contract are\nrecoverable. International Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. Finck, 496 S.W.2d 544, 546–547 (Tex.1973); 4M\nLinen Supply Co., Inc. v. W.P. Ballard & Co., Inc., 793 S.W.2d 320, 327 (Tex.App.—Houston\n[1st Dist.] 1990, writ denied). “[T]he plaintiff is required to show that the fees were incurred while\nsuing ... on a claim which allows recovery of such fees.” Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822\nS.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex.1991); Harmes v. Arklatex Corp., 615 S.W.2d 177, 180 (Tex.1981). However,\nsegregation is not required if services are rendered “in connection with claims arising out of the\nsame transaction and are so interrelated that their ‘prosecution or defense entails proof or denial\nof essentially the same facts.’ ” Stewart Title Guar. Co., 822 S.W.2d at 11.\n\n [115] Heritage asserts three bases for upholding the award of attorney's fees: (1) contract; (2)\ndeclaratory judgment; and (3) real estate fraud. Since no jury issue or question was either requested\nor presented on the real estate fraud question, and no recovery was had on a claim of real estate\nfraud, the fees are unsupportable under this theory. Likewise, because we have determined that\nthe Statute of Frauds bars enforcement of the May oral agreement, Heritage's claim for breach\nof contract fails as a matter of law and consequently, there can be no recovery of attorney's fees\nbased upon this ground. Therefore, only Heritage's suit for declaratory judgment will support the\ntrial court's award of attorney's fees.\n\n [116] [117] [118] The trial court granted Heritage two forms of declaratory relief. “In any\nproceeding [for declaratory judgment] the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary\nattorney's fees as are equitable and just.” TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 37.009.\nThe award of such costs and fees is within the discretion of the trial court and such an award\npremised upon an action for declaratory judgment will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear\nshowing of an abuse of discretion. Oake v. Collin County, 692 S.W.2d 454, 455 (Tex.1985);\nKnighton v. International Bus. Mach. Corp., 856 S.W.2d 206, 210 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st\nDist.] 1993, writ denied). Where a plaintiff pleads several causes of action including a request\nfor a declaratory judgment and for an award of attorney's fees and is subsequently awarded\ndeclaratory relief but denied other relief, he is only entitled to those attorney's fees attributable\nto the declaratory judgment action. Leon Ltd. v. Albuquerque Commons Partnership, 862 S.W.2d\n693, 708 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1993, no writ); Canales v. Zapatero, 773 S.W.2d 659, 662 (Tex.App.\n—San Antonio 1989, writ denied). Accordingly, because we find that Heritage's tort causes\nof action entailed proof of facts unnecessary for the declaratory judgment and considering the\npercentage basis of the award which did not segregate the fees attributable to the declaratory action,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Debtor objected. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District\nof Michigan sustained the objection and disallowed the liquidated damages portion of the claim.\nClaimant appealed. On the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court,\nDenise Page Hood, J., granted debtor's motion and denied claimant's motion. Claimant appealed.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, R. Guy Cole, Jr., Circuit Judge, held that:\n\n[1] the $100 per day figure was not a reasonable estimate of anticipated damages and, thus, under\nTexas law, the liquidated damages clause was an unenforceable “penalty” provision, and\n\n[2] under Texas law, debtor could not be estopped from asserting the affirmative defense of\nillegality.\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\nAttorneys and Law Firms\n\n*546 ARGUED: Abraham Singer, Pepper Hamilton, Detroit, Michigan, for Appellants.

GUY COLE, Circuit Judge.\n\nTwenty-seven Texas plaintiffs seeking recovery for injuries resulting from allegedly faulty breast\nimplants engaged in settlement negotiations with the implants' manufacturer, Dow Corning\nCorp., a Michigan company. After the discussions reached an impasse over terms covering\nthe consequences in the event settlement payments were not timely, Dow Corning suggested a\nclause requiring payments of $100 per day to each plaintiff for any time during which settlement\npayments were late. The plaintiffs agreed to this clause, and entered into the settlement agreement,\nlater selling their right to settlement payments to Appellant Bear Stearns. When Dow Corning\ndeclared bankruptcy and began to miss payments under the settlement agreement, Bear Stearns\nattempted to enforce the clause via a bankruptcy claim. The district court, on Dow Corning's\nmotion for summary judgment, held that the clause was a penalty unenforceable under Texas law,\nand also found that a condition precedent to the contractual provision of liquidated damages had\nnot been met. Bear Stearns now appeals, arguing that the condition precedent was in fact met,\nand that Dow Corning should be estopped from asserting that the clause is a penalty. Because the\nclause is a penalty unenforceable under Texas law, and because Texas courts preclude parties from\nbeing estopped from asserting an illegality defense, we AFFIRM the decision below.\n\n\n\n                                                     I.\n\nFollowing revelations that many of Dow Corning's silicone-based breast implants were faulty,\nnumerous suits were filed against Defendant–Appellee Dow Corning Corp. (“Dow Corning”).\nTwenty-seven Texas residents (“Plaintiffs”) filed suit in Texas state court in 1994, alleging various\nclaims against Dow Corning. Dow Corning found itself “under significant pressure” to settle these\ntwenty-seven cases, especially since any findings of fact made in these cases (the “Texas cases”)\ncould have significant adverse effects upon Dow Corning's position in a related multi-district case\nand related global settlement discussions then pending in federal court in Alabama. Dow Corning\nwas also motivated to settle because of its view that the Texas cases were filed in a “plaintiff-\nfriendly” forum. Dow Corning thus hired Ken Feinberg, a noted expert in settlement practice, to\nengage in settlement negotiations with the Plaintiffs.\n\n *547 But for one sticking point, the negotiations went smoothly. Both parties agreed that Texas\nlaw would control the settlement agreement. Dow Corning would pay the Plaintiffs a total of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  2\n\fIn re Dow Corning Corp., 419 F.3d 543 (2005)\n45 Bankr.Ct.Dec. 46, 2005 Fed.App. 0360P\n\n$17 million over the course of several years, in a series of seven installments. This payment\nwould be secured by an “Agreed Judgment” filed in Texas court, though the judgment would\nbe enforced only if Dow Corning failed to make a timely settlement payment. Plaintiffs' counsel\nwould be responsible for determining what portion of the $17 million each individual Plaintiff\nwould receive. Further, if Dow Corning ever were late on an installment payment, the entire\nsettlement amount would come due. However, near the end of negotiations, Plaintiffs' counsel\ninsisted on a clause (the “no credit clause”) which provided that if Dow Corning ever failed to\nmake a timely payment, it would not receive credit against the judgment for previously made\npayments. For example, under this clause, if Dow Corning failed to make a required final payment\nof $200,000 to a particular Plaintiff, that Plaintiff would be able to enforce the “agreed judgment”\nagainst Dow Corning for the full settlement amount of $1,400,000, rather than merely for the\n$200,000 portion of the judgment remaining unpaid. This would occur despite the fact that the\nPlaintiff in this example would already have received $1,200,000 of the $1,400,000 due. Plaintiffs'\ncounsel justified this clause by stating that it would provide a significant incentive for Dow\nCorning to pay scheduled payments on time.\n\nNot wishing to place itself in a position where it could potentially be required to “double-pay”\na significant portion of the settlement, Dow Corning steadfastly objected to the no credit clause.\nHowever, Dow Corning by its own admission at this time felt “a tremendous sense of urgency to\nfinalize the settlement.” Accordingly, Dow Corning's attorneys proposed replacing the no credit\nclause in each Plaintiff's agreement with language requiring a “penalty” of $100 to be paid for\neach day that Dow Corning was late in paying a particular Plaintiff. After insisting that all uses\nof “penalty” be changed to “liquidated damages,” and after making some insignificant stylistic\nchanges, Plaintiffs' attorneys agreed to insert the following language proposed by Dow Corning:\n\n            In the event that [Dow Corning] fails to make any payment in accordance\n            with [the] Agreement, and Plaintiff must seek enforcement of the judgment to\n            obtain the amounts due, then [Dow Corning] will pay to Plaintiff, as liquidated\n            damages, the sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per day for each day that\n            payment is not made from the date payment was due until the date Plaintiff\n            receives the full amount due and owing under the terms of this agreement. These\n            liquidated damages shall be in addition to the assessment of costs and interest as\n            provided in the agreed judgment and the acceleration of installment payments\n            as provided in [ ] the Agreement.\n\nThe Plaintiffs' attorneys noted at that time that if the new provision provided for a “penalty,” the\nprovision would not be enforceable under Texas law.\n\nThe parties agreed on this language, and inserted the clause into each settlement agreement.\nDow Corning paid the first installment payment, totalling $4 million, on December 1, 1994.\nHowever, on May 15, 1995, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy in the Eastern District of Michigan,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

All of the Plaintiffs timely filed claims in bankruptcy\ncourt for the amounts due under the settlement agreement. In February 1997, while the bankruptcy\n *548 case was pending, the Plaintiffs all sold their claims to Appellant Bear Stearns Investment\nProducts, Inc., and related entities (collectively, “Bear Stearns”). Bear Stearns was then substituted\nfor the Plaintiffs in the bankruptcy case.\n\nYears later, a reorganization plan was approved for Dow Corning. The plan included payment to\nBear Stearns of the full remaining settlement amount of $13 million, plus post-petition interest of\n$9.6 million. 1 During bankruptcy proceedings, Bear Stearns also claimed liquidated damages in\nthe amount of $8.75 million pursuant to the settlement agreement. Dow Corning filed an objection\nto this portion of Bear Stearns's claim, and the bankruptcy court, without any written findings,\nsustained the objection and disallowed the liquidated damages portion of the claim. Bear Stearns\nappealed to the district court. Since Dow Corning was fully solvent and had agreed to pay whatever\nthe district court determined was due, the court allowed the confirmed plan to become effective\nwhile the liquidated damages appeal was pending. As a result, just after the plan's effective date,\non June 1, 2004, Bear Stearns was paid the $22.6 million both parties agreed was due under the\nplan. Meanwhile, Bear Stearns and Dow Corning each had filed a motion for summary judgment\nin district court with regard to the additional liquidated damages. The district court denied Bear\nStearns's motion, and granted summary judgment to Dow Corning, finding that the liquidated\ndamages clause was a penalty unenforceable under Texas law, and that even if it were not, a\ncondition precedent to any award of liquidated damages had not been met. The district court\nthen certified the grant of summary judgment as final, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), since the ruling\nconclusively resolved all claims with regard to the liquidated damages clause. This timely appeal\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n                                                    II.\n\nA. Choice of Law and Standard of Review\n [1] Both parties agree that, pursuant to the settlement agreement's choice-of-law provision, the\nconstruction and enforcement of terms of the settlement agreement is governed by the laws of\nTexas. Though there is a circuit split over what choice-of-law provisions a federal court exercising\nbankruptcy jurisdiction should apply, compare, e.g., In re Vortex Fishing Sys., Inc., 277 F.3d 1057,\n1069 (9th Cir.2002) (requiring use of federal choice-of-law principles) with, e.g., In re Gaston\n& Snow, 243 F.3d 599, 604–07 (2d Cir.2001) (describing this split in great detail and requiring\nuse of the forum state's choice-of-law principles); see also, e.g., In re S.W. Equip. Rental Inc.,\nNo. CIV 1–90–62, 1992 WL 684872, at *9 n. 48 (E.D.Tenn. Jul.9, 1992), both Michigan choice-\nof-law rules and general equitable choice-of-law policies support enforcing parties' agreed-upon\nchoice-of-law clauses absent any strong public policy concerns to the contrary. See, e.g., Mill's\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., 300 F.3d 701, 705 (6th Cir.2002) (“Michigan choice of law rules ...\nrequire a court to balance the expectations of the parties to a contract with the interests of the\nstates involved to determine which state's law to apply.” (citations omitted)); *549 Restatement\n(Second) of Conflicts of Law § 302 (1971) (suggesting similar principles in the non-state-specific\ncontext). As we are aware of no public policy disfavoring application of Texas law in the instant\ncase, we agree with the parties and the district court, and apply Texas law in determining the\nenforceability of the subject contract terms.\n\n [2] [3] [4] Since the instant claims were brought in bankruptcy court pursuant to federal\nbankruptcy jurisdiction, federal procedural rules apply. Therefore, we review the district court's\nlegal conclusions de novo. In re Batie, 995 F.2d 85, 88 (6th Cir.1993); In re Dow Corning Corp.,\n280 F.3d 648, 656 (6th Cir.2002). In applying state law, we anticipate how the relevant state's\nhighest court would rule in the case and are bound by controlling decisions of that court. Allstate\nIns. Co. v. Thrifty Rent–A–Car Sys., Inc., 249 F.3d 450, 454 (6th Cir.2001). Intermediate state\nappellate courts' decisions are also viewed as persuasive unless it is shown that the state's highest\ncourt would decide the issue differently. Id.\n\n [5] Under federal procedural law, in deciding a motion for summary judgment in a bankruptcy\nproceeding, this Court must determine if “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue\nas to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”\nFed R. Civ P. 56(c); see also Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7056 (“Rule 56 F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary\nproceedings.”). As usual, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\nparty. See, e.g., Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586–88, 106\nS.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). However, since the instant appeal is from both the grant of\nsummary judgment to Dow Corning and the denial of summary judgment to Bear Stearns, it is\nappropriate to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party.\n\n [6] Finally, under Texas law, the determination of whether a contract term is properly a liquidated\ndamages provision or instead an unenforceable penalty is purely a question of law. See, e.g.,\nValence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 664 (Tex.2005) (“Whether a contract term\nis a liquidated damages provision is a question of law for the court to decide.”); S. Union Co.\nv. CSG Sys., Inc., No. 03–04–00172–CV, 2005 WL 171349, at *4 (Tex.Ct.App. Jan. 27, 2005)\n(“Whether the liquidated damages provision is enforceable is a question of law.”). “Sometimes,\nhowever, factual issues must be resolved before the legal question can be decided. For example,\nto show that a liquidated damages provision is unreasonable because the actual damages incurred\nwere much less than the amount contracted for, a defendant may be required to prove what the\nactual damages were.” Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 788 (Tex.1991).\n\n\nB. Liquidated Damages\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                5\n\fIn re Dow Corning Corp., 419 F.3d 543 (2005)\n45 Bankr.Ct.Dec. 46, 2005 Fed.App. 0360P\n\n [7] [8] [9] [10] Bear Stearns first argues that the $100 per day provision is a valid\nliquidated damages clause. Under Texas law, a “liquidated damages” term is treated as a penalty,\nunenforceable for reasons of public policy, except when all three of the following conditions are\nmet:\n\n   First, [ (1) ] the anticipated damages for a breach must be difficult or impossible to estimate.\n   Also, [ (2) ] the amount of liquidated damages must be a reasonable forecast of the amount\n   necessary to render just compensation. In addition, [ (3) ] ‘liquidated damages must not be\n   disproportionate to actual damages,’ as measured at the time of the breach. Thus, if the liquidated\n   damages are disproportionate *550 to the actual damages, the clause will not be enforced and\n   recovery will be limited to the actual damages proven.\n\nThanksgiving Tower Partners v. Anros Thanksgiving Partners, 64 F.3d 227, 232 (5th\nCir.1995) (footnotes omitted) (quoting Baker v. Int'l Record Syndicate, 812 S.W.2d 53, 55\n(Tex.Ct.App.1991)). Further, “[t]he party seeking to prevent enforcement bears the burden of\nproof on these [three] issues.” Id.; see also Fluid Concepts, Inc. v. DA Apartments Ltd. P'ship,\n159 S.W.3d 226, 231 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005) (concluding that trial court had erred in granting\nsummary judgment to defendant where defendant had presented no evidence supporting denial of\nliquidated damages, despite plaintiff's failure to provide any proof in support of such damages).\nAccordingly, to defeat Bear Stearns's motion for summary judgment and to prevail on its own\nsummary judgment motion, Dow Corning bore the burden of proving that any one of the preceding\nconditions had not been met. Finally, Texas law grants strong deference to enforcement of\ncontract terms, including liquidated damages terms, shown to be mutually bargained for by equally\ncompetent parties. S. Union, 2005 WL 171349, at *5 (citing Shel-al Corp. v. Am. Nat'l Ins. Co.,\n492 F.2d 87, 94 (5th Cir.1974)). The district court ruled against Bear Stearns, finding that none of\nthe prongs of the liquidated damages test were met.\n\n\n1. Were Future Damages Stemming From Breach Difficult to Estimate?\n [11] Bear Stearns first argues that the district court erred when it determined that all liquidated\ndamages clauses in contracts for the payment of money are unenforceable penalties. The district\ncourt concluded that since interest can be paid to offset any delay in receiving money due under\na contract, damages for such contracts will always be easy to estimate. For this proposition, the\ndistrict court relied significantly on language from Langever v. R.G. Smith & Co., 278 S.W. 178,\n179 (Tex.Ct.App.1925):\n\n            In determining the intention of the parties to such stipulation, certain well-\n            recognized rules of construction enter into the consideration, an important one\n            of which is, the certainty or uncertainty of the actual damages which a breach\n            will occasion, and the ease or difficulty of ascertaining or proving such damages;\n            hence, in a case of a contract for the payment of money simply, a stipulation to\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

While this passage from Langever, taken alone, is supportive of the district court's holding,\nthe district court ignored the fact that this was only one factor to be considered under Texas law.\nThe plaintiff in Langever alleged that, due to non-payment on the contract at issue, he had lost\nsignificant profits (as, presumably, he was intending to reinvest the money once received), and\nthat the liquidated damages term had been an attempt to estimate the result of his not having been\npaid. Despite the dicta cited by the district court in the instant case, the Langever court went on\nto state first that, “Where it is certain that damages will flow, and where it is certain they cannot\nbe accurately measured, or where it appears their ascertainment, if possible, will be difficult, the\nbest reasons exist for respecting the agreement of the parties in advance upon a sum mutually\nsatisfactory.” Id. The Langever *551 court then granted enforcement of the clause, despite its\ndicta, noting that “Any effort to establish the actual damages for a breach of a contract such as the\none under consideration here would be attended with such unusual considerations and surrounded\nwith such uncertainty and difficulties as to take the case out of the usual class of cases of mere\ndefault in the payment of money, and thus to afford fair grounds for sustaining an agreement for\nliquidated damages.” Id.\n\nAccordingly, Langever merely stands for Texas's consistent law that liquidated damages clauses in\ncontracts for payment of money are unenforceable except when damages are particularly difficult\nto estimate. Bear Stearns argues that the liquidated damages clauses in the instant case were\nintended to compensate for difficulties encountered by the Plaintiffs were they not to receive the\nsettlement monies they were expecting to receive. According to Plaintiffs' attorneys, such damages\nspecifically included losses sustained by the Plaintiffs' inabilities to meet obligations they had\nmade based on the promise of Dow Corning to make payments under the settlement agreement.\nBear Stearns alleges that such difficulties would have been particularly difficult to estimate here,\nbecause Plaintiffs' difficulties included damages beyond the usual “lost investment opportunities”\nand inabilities to make house and car payments. Rather, Bear Stearns asserts that the clause was\nalso intended to compensate for difficulties resulting from a failure to be able to meet future\nobligations incurred in expectation of receiving settlement payments, including obligations such\nas future (and inherently unpredictable) medical services required due to illness caused by the\nallegedly faulty implants, and also Plaintiffs' “decisions to discontinue working if they could afford\nto do so.”\n\nOn this prong, Dow Corning raises two arguments in addition to that relied upon by the district\ncourt. First, Dow Corning argues that the items Bear Stearns claims would be “damages” following\nnon-payment are actually damages that the initial settlement itself had contemplated, and thus the\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   7\n\fIn re Dow Corning Corp., 419 F.3d 543 (2005)\n45 Bankr.Ct.Dec. 46, 2005 Fed.App. 0360P\n\nliquidated damages clause effectively would double-pay for these amounts. Bear Stearns responds\nby noting that the liquidated damages provision was not intended to cover medical expenses\nresulting from the faulty implants, but rather to compensate for additional costs associated with\nreceiving late payments from Dow Corning. We agree with Bear Stearns that this conclusion is\nreasonable in light of Langever, which specifically allowed liquidated damages in a situation in\nwhich future damages resulting from non-payment were likely to be more than the time-value of\nmonies owed under the original contract.\n\nDow Corning's second argument is that the parties simply were not anticipating any additional\ndamages from non-payment, difficult to calculate or otherwise. Dow Corning cites to the fact\nthat the liquidated damages clause was initially proposed as a “penalty,” and that none of the\nattorneys in the case from either side could remember any discussions regarding difficult-to-\ncalculate damages. In contrast, Bear Stearns notes that at least one of the Plaintiffs' attorneys stated\nspecifically that “the liquidated damages provision was to recognize that [Plaintiffs] would have\nlosses sustained by their inability to meet the obligations that they had made based on the promise\nof Dow Corning to make payments under this Agreement.” These duelling assertions, however,\ngo to the question of whether the provision was actually a just forecast of any damages, and not\nto whether such damages, if contemplated, would be difficult to calculate. Dow Corning does\nnot argue that the damages *552 resulting from non-payment of settlement monies, including\ninability to meet future medical and other obligations, would be easy to calculate. Obviously, the\ntwenty-seven Plaintiffs would each face differing levels of such damages, and in this particular\ncase, no party has argued that the Plaintiffs' medical or other obligations were uniform or\npredictable. Accordingly, Dow Corning has failed to show that the anticipated damages would not\nbe difficult to estimate.\n\n\n2. Was the Liquidated Damages Clause a Reasonable Forecast of Just Compensation for\nSuch Damages?\n [12] The district court also gave two reasons for concluding that Bear Stearns ought to lose on\nprong two, regarding whether the amount of liquidated damages was a reasonable forecast of the\namount necessary to render just compensation. Unsurprisingly, Dow Corning agrees with both.\nFirst, the district court found that the $100 per day simply was not a forecast of compensation for\nany damages, but rather was initially intended as a penalty. Second, the district court concluded\nthat even if the Plaintiffs' attorneys had intended this clause as compensation for damages, there\nwas no evidence that the likely amount of such damages was ever estimated at all or that it was\ncompared with $100 per day, nor was any evidence provided that any negotiations over what\namount would be reasonable compensation had ever occurred. The district court concluded that\nthe clause thus was not a “reasonable forecast of just compensation.”\n\nBear Stearns argues that the burden was on Dow Corning to prove that the clause was not a\nreasonable forecast, and that Dow Corning simply has not presented any evidence that the clause\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     8\n\fIn re Dow Corning Corp., 419 F.3d 543 (2005)\n45 Bankr.Ct.Dec. 46, 2005 Fed.App. 0360P\n\nwas not a reasonable forecast of damages. However, this argument both discounts the evidence\nDow Corning has presented and overstates Dow Corning's burden. Dow Corning has presented\nevidence that the parties did not discuss potential uncertain damages resulting from breach, and has\nalso presented evidence that the clause was initially proposed as a penalty untied to any potential\ndamages.\n\nBear Stearns argues that the district court unfairly shifted the burden of proof to Bear Stearns.\nHowever, such a shifting was not improper in light of evidence presented by Dow Corning\nthat is probative of a lack of both intent to provide just compensation and the existence of any\nconsideration of any estimates of what just compensation would be. Bear Stearns's only statement\nto counter Dow Corning's evidence of a lack of connection between the clause and any estimate of\ndamages is that “[g]iven the large number of individual Plaintiffs and the difficulty in estimating\neach Plaintiff's actual damages in the event of a breach by Dow, the $100 per day figure was\na reasonable estimate of those damages.” This argument may reasonably rebut one of Dow\nCorning's other arguments, that the damages were not reasonably predictive of damages potentially\nor actually incurred by any one specific Plaintiff. Regardless, however, the fact that there are\nnumerous Plaintiffs or that each Plaintiff's damages were uncertain does not logically imply that\n$100 per day was a reasonable estimate of damages.\n\nBear Stearns further argues that “[h]aving proposed the $100 per day figure, Dow clearly believed\nit was reasonable at the time.” However, such an inference cannot be made. When Dow Corning\nproposed the $100 figure, the uncontradicted evidence shows that it intended the figure as a\npenalty, and not as a reasonable estimation of some set of damages. Bear Stearns cites no evidence\ntying the $100 figure to any of the types of damages it claims Plaintiffs were estimated to face\n *553 post-breach, while Dow Corning cites evidence probative of an absence of a concern for\nwhether $100 was just compensation. For this reason alone, Bear Stearns's arguments fail. See,\ne.g., Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)\n(requiring a party defending against a motion for summary judgment to provide more than a\n“scintilla” of evidence to support the conclusion that there is a genuine issue of material fact for\ntrial).\n\nThe district court also held that the $100 per day provision was not a reasonable estimate of\njust compensation for the anticipated damages because such liquidated damages would constitute\ndouble recovery for damages already compensated by the base settlement payments. See, e.g.,\nEberts v. Businesspeople Personnel Servs., Inc., 620 S.W.2d 861 (Tex.Ct.App.1981) (disallowing\ndouble recovery via liquidated damages); Robert G. Beneke & Co., Inc. v. Cole, 550 S.W.2d 321\n(Tex.Ct.App.1977) (same). However, Bear Stearns properly notes that the damages for which\nit is claiming liquidated damages are not damages contemplated by the underlying contract,\nsince the damages at issue here are those resulting from a breach of the settlement agreement\nitself (e.g. difficulties or other costs resulting from inability to pay medical bills or other bills\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Accordingly, the district court should not have\nconcluded that enforcement of the liquidated damages clause would constitute double recovery.\nNonetheless, because Dow Corning provided evidence that the provisions were not actually\nreasonable estimations of any anticipated damages from breach, the second prong of the liquidated\ndamages test, and thus the result of the entire test, was properly resolved in Dow Corning's favor.\n\n\n3. Are the Liquidated Damages Disproportionate to the Actual Damages Incurred by\nPlaintiffs?\nBecause Dow Corning has met its burden of proving that the clause was not a reasonable estimation\nof any anticipated damages, the entire three-part test must be resolved in its favor. See, e.g., Baker,\n812 S.W.2d at 55. Therefore, we need not determine whether the “liquidated damages” under the\nclause would be disproportionate to any actual damages incurred by Plaintiffs.\n\n\nC. Quasi–Estoppel and Unenforceable Liquidated Damages Clauses\n [13] [14] [15] Under Texas law, the illegality of a liquidated damages clause is an affirmative\ndefense that must be asserted by a defendant when it is not clear from the face of the agreement\nthat the clause is illegal. See, e.g., Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 789–90 (Tex.1991). Bear\nStearns argues that the doctrine of quasi-estoppel should prevent Dow Corning from being able to\nassert this affirmative defense, and therefore that the liquidated damages clause should be enforced.\nQuasi-estoppel is appropriate where “it would be unconscionable to allow a person to maintain\na position inconsistent with one to which he acquiesced, or from which he accepted a benefit.”\nLopez v. Muñoz, Hockema & Reed, L.L.P., 22 S.W.3d 857, 864 (Tex.2000) (citing Atkinson Gas\nCo. v. Albrecht, 878 S.W.2d 236, 240 (Tex.Ct.App.1994)). Bear Stearns argues that since Dow\nCorning proposed the clause in order to induce settlement with the Plaintiffs, thereby avoiding\ncostly litigation, Dow Corning cannot now assert that the clause is illegal. However, regardless\nof whether quasi-estoppel would be appropriate here, *554 Texas courts have clearly stated that\none cannot be estopped from arguing that a contract term is illegal for public policy reasons. See,\ne.g., In re Kasschau, 11 S.W.3d 305, 312–14 (Tex.Ct.App.1999); see also In re Calderon, 96\nS.W.3d 711, 719–20 (Tex.Ct.App.2003). Accordingly, under Texas law, Dow Corning simply\ncannot be estopped from asserting the affirmative defense of illegality, even if quasi-estoppel\nwould otherwise be applicable. Because Dow Corning did indeed assert this defense, and because\nwe conclude that this defense has merit, Bear Stearns's argument fails.\n\n\n\n                                                    III.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

FIELD, Justice.\n\n *1 Landlord Liaquat Ali Khan sued tenant Nizarali Meknojiya for breach of the parties'\ncommercial lease. In the suit, Khan sought damages pursuant to the lease's holdover provision,\ncontending that Meknojiya became a holdover tenant as a result of Khan's termination of the\nlease. Meknojiya moved for summary judgment on the sole ground that Khan's recovery under the\nholdover provision is barred as a matter of law because it represents an unenforceable penalty in\nthe form of “double-rent.” The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Meknojiya,\nand following a bench trial only on attorney's fees, the court rendered a final judgment that Khan\ntake nothing on his claims and that Meknojiya recover attorney's fees. Because we conclude that\nthe holdover provision is not an unenforceable penalty, we reverse the trial court's judgment and\nremand the case for further proceedings.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meknojiya, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 3336874\n\n\n\n\n                                              BACKGROUND\n\nKhan owns commercial property located in Austin, Texas. In 1996, Khan and Meknojiya entered\ninto a written lease agreement, and Meknojiya began operating a convenience store on the leased\npremises. The parties renegotiated their lease (“the lease”) in March 2002. The renegotiated lease\nrequired Meknojiya to pay $4,500 per month in “base rent” and included the following paragraph,\nwhich the parties refer to as a “holdover provision”:\n\n           2.07 Holding Over.If Tenant does not vacate the Leased Premises upon the\n           expiration or earlier termination of the Lease, Tenant shall be a tenant at\n           sufferance for the holdover period and all of the terms and provisions of this\n           Lease shall be applicable during that period, except that Tenant shall pay\n           Landlord (in addition to additional rent payable under this Lease and any other\n           sums payable under this Lease) as base rental for the period of such holdover\n           an amount equal to two times the base rent which would have been payable by\n           Tenant had the holdover period been a part of the original terms of the Lease\n           (without waiver of Landlord's right to recover damages as permitted by law).\n\nAccording to Khan, Meknojiya committed a series of breaches following execution of the 2002\nlease. For instance, Khan contends that Meknojiya (1) failed to obtain or renew required insurance,\n(2) failed to provide the required insurance documentation, and (3) permitted a corporation owned\nby other individuals to operate the convenience store without obtaining Khan's prior written\nconsent. Khan notified Meknojiya in writing, through counsel, that Meknojiya was in default of\nthe lease and that Khan was exercising his option to terminate the lease effective May 1, 2002.\nNevertheless, despite additional notices of default, Meknojiya continued to occupy the premises\nand to pay $4,500 per month until January 2, 2007, the date the lease was set to have expired by\nits own terms.\n\nKhan subsequently sued Meknojiya for breach of the lease, asserting that upon Meknojiya's breach\nof the lease and Khan's notification that the lease was terminated, Meknojiya occupied the property\nas a tenant at sufferance.

After conducting a\nhearing, the trial court granted Meknojiya's motion for summary judgment but denied Khan's\nmotion. Following a bench trial on Meknojiya's remaining counterclaim for attorney's fees, the trial\ncourt rendered a final judgment incorporating the trial court's order granting summary judgment\nin favor of Meknojiya and ordering Khan to pay $60,191.71 in attorney's fees. 2 In three issues on\nappeal, Khan argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Meknojiya\nand consequently, in awarding Meknojiya attorney's fees as the prevailing party.\n\n\n\n                                       STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nWe review a trial court's ruling on summary judgment de novo.

Meknojiya, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 3336874\n\nThis assertion by Meknojiya is an affirmative defense that he had the burden of pleading and\nproving. See Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 788 (Tex.1991). As a result, to be entitled to\nsummary judgment, Meknojiya had to conclusively establish every element of this defense. See\nRyland Grp., Inc. v. Hood, 924 S.W.2d 120, 121 (Tex.1996) (per curiam).\n\n *3 “The universal rule for measuring damages for the breach of a contract is just compensation\nfor the loss or damage actually sustained.”Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. Accordingly, a liquidated-\ndamages provision is not enforceable if, in effect, it is a penalty. See id.(“Whether a contractual\nprovision is an enforceable liquidated damages provision or an unenforceable penalty is a question\nof law for the court to decide.”). A liquidated-damages provision is enforceable only if a court\nfinds that (1) the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) the\namount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.Id. Whether\na liquidated-damages provision is an unenforceable penalty is a question of law for the court,\nalthough sometimes factual issues must be resolved before the court can decide the legal question.\nId.\n\nIn his first and second issues on appeal, Khan argues that the trial court erred in granting\nMeknojiya's summary-judgment motion because Meknojiya failed to conclusively establish the\nessential elements of his affirmative defense of penalty. Specifically, Khan argues that, as a matter\nof law, paragraph 2.07 is not an unenforceable penalty provision because it is not a liquidated-\ndamages provision at all. Instead, according to Khan, paragraph 2.07 simply sets forth the parties'\nagreed rental rate for any holdover period. Based on the unambiguous language of the lease, we\nagree.\n\nWhether a contract term is a liquidated-damages provision is a question of law for the court.\nValence Operating Co., 164 S.W.3d. at 644. “The term ‘liquidated damages' ordinarily refers to\nan acceptable measure of damages that parties stipulate in advance will be assessed in the event\nof a contract breach.”Flores v. Millennium Interests, Ltd., 185 S.W.3d 427, 431 (Tex.2005). Here,\nparagraph 2.07 sets an agreed-upon rental rate for situations in which the tenant has failed to\nsurrender the leased premises upon expiration of the lease term or earlier termination by one of the\nparties. The provision itself describes the amount due during the holdover period as “base rental for\nthe period of such holdover.”Further, paragraph 2.07 states that payment of such rental amounts\ndo not waive the landlord's right to recover “damages as permitted by law.” In other words, based\non the plain language of the lease, there is no indication that the parties intended the amounts owed\nunder paragraph 2.07 as a means of forecasting damages in the event of a breach. And, while rent\nunder paragraph 2.07 may, in certain circumstances, form the basis of measuring damages, it does\nnot independently set a damages amount or attempt to calculate damages. Simply put, any amount\nowed under paragraph 2.07 does not equate to a stipulated measure of damages; rather, it is an\nagreed-upon rental amount that is due under particular circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meknojiya, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 3336874\n\nOur conclusion that paragraph 2.07 of the lease is not a liquidated-damages provision, and\ntherefore is not a penalty, is consistent with that of our sister court of appeals in Dallas in analyzing\nwhether a similar clause operated as a penalty provision. See Meridien Hotels, Inc. v. LHO Fin.\nP'ship I, L.P., 255 S.W.3d 807 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.). In Meridien Hotels, the landlord\nleased hotel space to the tenant under a lease that required the tenant to pay 1.5 times the base\nrental amount if the tenant remained in the space upon termination of the lease by one of the parties\nor the lease term's expiration. 3 Id. at 822.The landlord sent the tenant a notice of termination of\nthe lease, but the tenant remained in the hotel space anyway. Id. at 814.The landlord eventually\nsued the tenant, seeking multiple types and amounts of damages, including $2,130,136 in holdover\nrent, plus prejudgment interest, all of which the trial court awarded. Id.\n\n *4 The tenant appealed, claiming that the holdover rent provision was an unlawful penalty and\nthat, as a result, the trial court erred in awarding pre-judgment interest on that amount. Id. at\n822.Concluding that the holdover rental rate did not constitute a penalty, the court of appeals\nconcluded that the provision “does not punish appellants; it instead requires that if appellants make\nthe decision to hold over beyond the term of the lease, they must pay a higher rate for doing so.\nAppellants were on notice that [the landlord] considered the lease terminated, yet they chose to\nstay, having agreed in the lease to pay 1.5 times the usual rent for doing so.”Id.\n\nLikewise, in this case, paragraph 2.07 of the parties' lease agreement sets out in advance the rent to\nbe paid should the tenant choose to remain on the premises after one of the parties terminates the\nlease or the lease expires by its own terms, creating a tenancy at sufferance. Upon expiration or\ntermination of the lease, the tenant must decide whether to (1) leave the leased premises (assuming\nhe is not forcibly removed) or (2) hold over under the lease as a tenant at sufferance and pay\nadditional rent at the agreed holdover rate. Such additional rent is not a penalty; in fact, it does\nnot represent liquidated damages at all. Rather, the additional rent is the agreed-to, bargained-for\namount of rent due and owing in the event of a holdover. 4\n\nBecause paragraph 2.07 of the parties' lease agreement is not a liquidated-damages provision, it\ncannot be an unenforceable penalty, as a matter of law. We therefore conclude that the trial court\nerred in granting summary judgment in favor of Meknojiya on this ground. In addition, because\nMeknojiya should not have prevailed on summary judgment, it follows that he was not entitled to\nattorney's fees. We sustain appellant's first and second issues on appeal. 5\n\n\n\n                                               CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meknojiya, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 3336874\n\nBecause we conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment, we reverse the trial\ncourt's judgment and award of attorney's fees in favor of Meknojiya. We remand the case to the\ntrial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Khan also asked the trial court to render summary judgment that he was entitled to attorney's fees, but to reserve judgment on the\n        amount of fees for a separate hearing.\n2       Paragraph 13.03 of the lease states:\n              Attorney's Fees.The prevailing party in any legal proceeding brought under or with a relation to this agreement shall be entitled\n              to recover form the non-prevailing party, their reasonable attorney['s] fees, court costs and expenses, including but not limited\n              to travel and witness costs.\n3       Specifically, the lease at issue in Meridien Hotels, Inc. v. LHO Financing Partnership I, L.P., contained the following provision:\n              Any holding over by Tenant after the expiration or sooner termination of this Agreement shall be treated as a daily tenancy at\n              sufferance at a rate equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the Rent and other charges herein provided (prorated on a daily basis).\n           255 S.W.3d 807, 822 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.)\n4       Meknojiya relies on Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (Tex.1991), for the proposition that a contractual provision in which one\n        party agrees to pay the other some multiple of damages is an unenforceable penalty. Phillips is a classic illustration of a liquidated-\n        damages provision that constitutes an unlawful penalty. In the midst of divorce proceedings, a husband and wife agreed to create\n        a limited partnership rather than divide their substantial assets. Id. at 786–87.The agreement contained the following provision: “If\n        the general partner breaches his trust hereunder, he shall pay to the limited partner as liquidated damages ten times the amount she\n        loses as a result of such breaches of trust.”Id. at 787.In other words, once actual damages were established for breach of the parties'\n        contract, they would be multiplied by ten to reach the damages award. Id. at 789.The supreme court held that this provision was an\n        unenforceable penalty provision, rather than an enforceable liquidated damages provision. Id.\n           Meknojiya's reliance on Phillips in this case is misplaced. First, unlike paragraph 2.07, the provision at issue in Phillips was\n           undisputedly a liquidated-damages provision. As previously discussed, paragraph 2.07 is not a liquidated-damages provision at\n           all, but instead is a rental amount that is triggered if and when the lease expires or is terminated. Second, the liquidated-damages\n           provision at issue in Phillips was an unenforceable penalty on its face because the amount awarded by the provision was computed\n           by multiplying actual damages (once established).See id. at 789.Here, paragraph 2.07 does not require a separate determination of\n           damages or the application of any multiplier to that amount. Thus, even if we were to conclude that paragraph 2.07 is a liquidated-\n           damages provision, unlike the court in Phillips we could not conclude that it constitutes a penalty on its face.\n5       In his third issue on appeal, Khan argues that, even if the double-rent rate set forth in paragraph 2.07 represents liquidated damages,\n        Meknojiya failed to satisfy his burden to establish that it is an unenforceable penalty. Having sustained Khan's first and second issues\n        on appeal, we do not address this issue.

On appeal, the buyer (1) challenges the plaintiffs' standing to\nbring the suit, (2) contends that the liquidated damages clause of the contract is an unenforceable\npenalty, and (3) argues that the evidence that the buyer breached the contract is insufficient to\nsupport the trial court's judgment. We affirm in part and reverse and render in part.\n\n\n\n                                            BACKGROUND\n\nAlbert and Jennifer Magill entered into a contract to purchase residential real estate from the Estate\nof William H. Watson, Sr. (“the Estate”). The original closing date of the contract was November\n25, 2008, and, by amendment, was extended by agreement of the parties until January 25, 2009.\nThe Magills deposited $8,000 in earnest money with the title company in connection with the\ncontract and amendment.\n\nThe contract provided that the “Buyer may object in writing to defects, exceptions, or\nencumbrances to title ... which prohibit the following use or activity: Construction of a new, single\nfamily residential home to be two stories containing approximately 5,000 square feet.”\n\nThe garage on the house that the Magills wished to build encroached on the rear set back line of the\nproperty, and the Magills were unable to obtain a variance from the homeowner's association to\nallow the construction of the garage as planned. On January 23, 2009, two days before the closing\ndate, the Magills terminated the contract. The escrow agent sent two forms authorizing release of\nthe earnest money; one form released the earnest money to the Magills and one form released the\nearnest money to the Estate. The Magills signed the form authorizing the release of the earnest\nmoney to themselves.\n\nAfter obtaining an assignment from the Estate on January 27, 2009, the trustees of the William\nHugh Watson, Jr. Trust–Non–Exempt and the Robin Watson Livesay Trust–Non–Exempt, filed\nsuit against the Magills on August 26, 2009, alleging breach of the contract. On June 29, 2009,\nthe trustees sent the Magills a letter demanding that they execute a release of the earnest money.\nThe Magills did not do so. The trustees filed suit against the Magills on August 26, 2009, alleging\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     2\n\fMagill v. Watson, 409 S.W.3d 673 (2013)\n\n\n\nthat they had breached the contract and seeking recovery of the earnest money, plus three times\nthe amount of the earnest money, based on the following contractual provisions:\n\n  15. DEFAULT: If Buyer fails to comply with this contract, Buyer will be in default, and Seller\n  may (a) enforce specific performance, seek such other relief as may be provided by law, or both,\n  or (b) terminate this contract and receive the earnest money as liquidated damages ....\n\n  18.D. DAMAGES: Any party who wrongfully fails or refuses to sign a release *677 acceptable\n  to the escrow agent ... will be liable to the other party for liquidated damages in an amount\n  equal to the sum of (i) three times the amount of the earnest money; (ii) the earnest money; (iii)\n  reasonable attorney's fees; and (iv) all costs of suit.\n\nThe case was tried to a jury, which found that the Magills had breached the contract. Thereafter, the\ntrial court entered a final judgment awarding the trustees $32,000.00, which represents the earnest\nmoney and liquidated damages in an amount of three times the earnest money, plus attorney's fees,\ninterest, and costs.\n\n\n\n                                              STANDING\n\nOn January 27, 2009, before suit was filed by the Estate, the Estate executed the following\nassignment to the trusts:\n\n            For and in consideration of $10.00 and other good and valuable consideration,\n            the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and confessed, the\n            Estate of William H. Watson, Sr., Deceased (the “Estate”) does hereby bargain,\n            sell, transfer and convey to the Williams Watson, Jr. Trust—Non–Exempt and\n            the Robin Watson Livesay Trust—Non–Exempt, in equal, undivided shares,\n            (a) all of the right, title and interest of the Estate in, to and under that certain\n            One to Four Family Residential Contract (Resale) (the “Contract” between the\n            Estate, as Seller, and Albert E. Magill and Jennifer T. Magill (collectively, the\n            “Magills”)), as Buyer dated effective August 25, 2008, and (b) all claims and\n            causes of action of the Estate against the Magills pertaining in any way to the\n            Contract and defenses of the Estate to any claims of the Magills pertaining in\n            any way to the contract.\n\nIn their first issue, the Magills contend that appellees Watson and Livesay, as trustees of the\nWilliam Watson, Jr. Trust and the Robin Watson Livesay Trust, did not have standing to\nbring a breach-of-contract claim against them. Specifically, the Magills argues that “the estate's\nassignment to appellees of the estate's causes of action against appellants is void when no cause of\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Watson, 409 S.W.3d 673 (2013)\n\n\n\naction is filed by the estate or is pending at time of the assignment[.]” The Magills further argue\nthat, absent a valid assignment, only the executor of the estate has standing to bring the suit.\n\n [1] [2] [3] Standing is a component of subject-matter jurisdiction. Tex. Ass'n of Bus. v. Tex.\nAir Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 445–46 (Tex.1993). A plaintiff has standing to sue when it\nis personally aggrieved by the alleged wrong. Nootsie, Ltd. v. Williamson Cnty. Appraisal Dist.,\n925 S.W.2d 659, 661 (Tex.1996). A plaintiff may also have standing by assignment of a cause of\naction. See State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Gandy, 925 S.W.2d 696, 706 (Tex.1996). A claim may\nbe assigned except when such an assignment is invalid as against public policy. Id. at 707.\n\n [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The five instances in which assigned causes action are void as against\npublic police are as follows: (1) The assignment of an interest in an estate is void if used to contest a\nwill. Trevino v. Turcotte, 564 S.W.2d 682, 690 (Tex.1978); (2) The assignment of plaintiff's claim\nto a tortfeasor in settlement is void when tortfeasor asserts the claim against a joint tortfeasor.\nInt'l Proteins Corp. v. Ralston–Purina Co., 744 S.W.2d 932, 934 (Tex.1988); (3) “Mary Carter”\nagreements are void. Elbaor v. Smith, 845 S.W.2d 240, 250 (Tex.1992); (4) The assignment of a\ndefendant's claims against his insurer to the plaintiff is void under certain circumstances. Gandy,\n925 S.W.2d at 705; and (5) The assignment of client's legal malpractice claim arising out of\nlitigation is *678 void. Zuniga v. Groce, Locke, & Hebdon, 878 S.W.2d 313, 318 (Tex.App.-San\nAntonio 1994, writ ref'd). The Magills do not contend that the assignment in this case falls within\none of these prohibited categories.\n\n [9] To recover on an assigned cause of action, the party claiming the assigned rights must prove\n(1) a cause of action existed that was capable of assignment and (2) the cause was in fact assigned\nto the party seeking recovery.

Gerdes, By and Through Griffin Chiropractic\nClinic, 880 S.W.2d 215, 217 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1994, writ denied).\n\n [10] The Magills argue that there was no cause of action that existed and was capable of\nassignment because no lawsuit had yet been filed. In support, the Magills rely on section 12.014\nof the Property Code, which provides:\n\n  (a) A judgment or a part of a judgment of a court of record or an interest in a cause of action on\n  which suit has been filed may be sold, regardless of whether the judgment or cause of action is\n  assignable in law or equity, if the transfer is in writing.\n\n  (b) A transfer under this section may be filed with the papers of the suit if the transfer is\n  acknowledged or sworn to in the form and manner required by law for acknowledgement or\n  swearing of deeds.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

If a\n  transfer of a cause of action in which a judgment has not been rendered is filed, the clerk shall\n  note and briefly state the substance of the transfer on the court docket at the place where the\n  suit is entered.\n\n  (d) A transfer filed under this section is notice to and is binding on a person subsequently dealing\n  with the judgment or cause of action.\n\nTEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 12.014 (Vernon 2004).\n\n [11] However, the purpose of the statute is to give parties dealing with a cause of action notice that\nit has been assigned and is not intended to affect the validity of any sale of a cause of action. See\nMallios v. Baker, 11 S.W.3d 157, 171 (Tex.2000) (J. Hecht, concurring) (citing Mitchell, Gartner\n& Thompson v. Young, 135 S.W.2d 308, 311 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth 1939, writ ref'd)). Section\n12.014 was not intended thereby to prevent the acquisition of title to a judgment, cause of action,\nor an interest therein, either legal or equitable, in any other lawful manner. HSBC Bank USA,\nN.A. v. Watson, 377 S.W.3d 766, 776 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2012, pet. filed.) (citing Hunter v. B.E.\nPorter, Inc., 81 S.W.2d 774, 775 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1935, no writ); Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. Mktg.\non Hold, Inc., 170 S.W.3d 814, 824–25 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2005), rev'd on other grounds,\n308 S.W.3d 909 (Tex.2010) (holding “nothing in [section 12.014] precludes or invalidates the\nassignments at issue in this matter simply because they were made prior to the filing of suit”)).\nTherefore, we conclude that section 12.014 has no bearing on the validity of the Estate's assignment\nto the trusts.\n\nThe Magills also rely on Briargrove Shopping Center Joint Venture v. Vilar, Inc., 647 S.W.2d 329,\n337–38 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1982, no writ) for the proposition that a suit affecting the\nassignor's rights must be pending at the time an assignment is executed. However, that language in\nBriargrove is dicta because in that case it was undisputed that a suit had *679 been filed before the\nassignment. Id. Furthermore, the case that Briargrove cites as authority involves the assignability\nof a wrongful death cause of action under the terms wrongful death statute at the time, thus is\ndistinguishable. See Lowe v. Emp'rs Cas. Co., 479 S.W.2d 383, 389–90 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth\n1972, no writ).\n\n [12] [13] The Magill's position is based on the false premise that a “cause of action” applies\nonly to claims that have already been filed in court. At common law, a “cause of action” ordinarily\nconsists of two distinct and separate elements, the primary right and duty of the parties respectively\nand the wrongful act or omission violating it. Mercantile Bank & Trust Co. v. Schuhart, 115 Tex.\n114, 277 S.W. 621, 623–24 (Tex.Com.App.1925). A “cause of action” has also been said to consist\nof those facts entitling one to institute and maintain an action at law or in equity. A.H. Belo Corp.\nv. Blanton, 133 Tex. 391, 396, 129 S.W.2d 619, 621 (1939); F.D.I.C v. Bodin Concrete Co., 869\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thus, a “cause of action” encompasses\nevery essential fact that a plaintiff must prove to obtain a judgment. F.D.I.C., 869 S.W.2d at 378.\nThus, by definition, a cause of action may exist before a suit is instituted.\n\n [14] Therefore, we hold that the fact that the Estate had not filed suit before it assigned its cause\nof action to the trusts is not a ground for concluding that the trustees lack standing. And, to the\nextent that the Magills are complaining that the trustees pleadings did not set forth the basis for\ntheir interest in the petition, we note that the Magills did not specially except to the petition on\nthat ground, thus the issue is waived. TEX.R. CIV. P. 90.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule issue one.\n\n\n\n                                          LIQUIDATED DAMAGES\n\nIn issue two, the Magills contend that the following liquidated damage provision is unenforceable\nbecause it is an illegal penalty. The contract provided as follows:\n\n            18.D. DAMAGES: Any party who wrongfully fails or refuses to sign a release\n            acceptable to the escrow agent ... will be liable to the other party for liquidated\n            damages in an amount equal to the sum of (i) three times the amount of the\n            earnest money, (ii) the earnest money; (iii) reasonable attorney's fees; and (iv)\n            all costs of suit. (Emphasis added).\n\n [15] [16] [17] [18] We enforce a liquidated damages clause if (1) the harm caused by the\nbreach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) the amount of liquidated damages is a\nreasonable forecast of just compensation. See Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 788 (Tex.1991).\nAn assertion that a liquidated damages provision constitutes an unenforceable penalty is an\naffirmative defense, and the party asserting penalty bears the burden of proof. Urban Television\nNetwork Corp. v. Liquidity Solutions, 277 S.W.3d 917, 919 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2009, no pet.); Fluid\nConcepts, Inc. v. DA Apts., LP, 159 S.W.3d 226, 231 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005, no pet.). Generally,\nthat party must prove the amount of actual damages, if any, to demonstrate that “the actual loss\nwas not an approximation of the stipulated sum.” Baker v. Int'l Record Syndicate, Inc., 812 S.W.2d\n53, 55 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1991, no writ). If the amount stipulated in the liquidated damages clause\nis “shown to be disproportionate to actual damages,” we should declare that the clause is a penalty\nand limit recovery to actual damages. Johnson Eng'rs, Inc. v. Tri–Water Supply Corp., 582 S.W.2d\n555, 557 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1979, no writ); see also TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. §\n2.718(a) (Vernon 2009) *680 (“A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a\npenalty.”). Whether a liquidated damages clause is an unenforceable penalty is a question of law\nfor the court, but sometimes factual issues must be resolved before the court can decide the legal\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  6\n\fMagill v. Watson, 409 S.W.3d 673 (2013)\n\n\n\nquestion. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. For example, in Phillips, the Texas Supreme Court\nobserved that “to show that a liquidated damages provision is unreasonable because the actual\ndamages incurred were much less than the amount contracted for, a defendant may be required to\nprove what the actual damages were.” Id.\n\nThe Magills, relying on Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788, contend that the liquidated damage provision\nis void on its face and no further evidence of the actual damages was required. We agree.\n\nIn Phillips, a partnership agreement contained the following liquidated damage provision in the\nevent of a breach of trust by the general partner to the limited partner: “If the general partner\nbreaches his trust hereunder, he shall pay to the limited partner as liquidated damages ten times the\namount she loses as a result of such breaches of trust.” Id. at 787. The supreme court granted an\napplication for writ of error “to decide whether a contractual provision that requires payment of a\nmultiple of actual damages for breach of trust is an unenforceable penalty[,]” and held as follows:\n\n            The enforceability of the contractual provision in this case involves no fact\n            issues. A contractual provision like the one here by which one party agrees to pay\n            the other some multiple of actual damages for breach of the agreement does not\n            meet either part of the legal test for an enforceable liquidated damages provision.\n            It cannot meet the first prong of the test because the harm caused by the breach\n            of the contract is not incapable or difficult of estimation. The provision assumes\n            actual damages can and will be determined, indeed must be determined, before\n            the prescribed multiplier can be applied. The provision cannot meet the second\n            prong of test because, instead of attempting to forecast actual damages, it calls\n            for them to be determined and then multiplied. A contractual provision like the\n            one in this case is thus, on its face, an unenforceable penalty.\n\nId. at 789 (internal citations omitted).\n\n [19] Here, the breach triggering the liquidated damage provision is the “wrongful[ ] fail[ure]\nor refus[al] to sign a release acceptable to the escrow agent.” However, the liquidated damage\nprovision makes no attempt to quantify the actual damages that would be caused by a failure to\nrelease the earnest money. Instead, the provision merely assumes that the earnest money, which\nthe parties have agreed will constitute actual damages for breach of the agreement in general,\nshould be trebled and added to the earnest money in the event that the obligation to release the\nearnest money is breached.\n\nThe trustees argue that “it is only natural that the liquidated damages for which paragraph 18.d\nprovides would be greater than [the earnest money] for which paragraph 15 provides, for the party\nentitled to the earnest money is forced to go through additional hoops it would not otherwise have\nhad to go through to ultimately obtain a recovery.” However, the damages suffered as a result of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  7\n\fMagill v. Watson, 409 S.W.3d 673 (2013)\n\n\n\ngoing through such “additional hoops,” i.e., attorney's fees, interest, and costs, are already elements\nof damages that can be recovered in a suit to obtain the earnest money. Likewise, the $80,000 the\ntrustees claim that they suffered as a result of selling the property at a lower purchase price is not\ndamage caused by the failure to release the earnest *681 money, but by the failure to close on\nthe real estate transaction.\n\nThus, we conclude that, because the contract provision simply takes the value of the earnest money,\nwhich the parties have agreed represents the actual damages caused by the breach of the agreement,\nand multiplies it times three if there is an additional breach of the obligation to turn over the earnest\nmoney, the provision is an unlawful penalty and does not attempt to forecast actual damages. This\nconclusion is supported by the comment promulgated by the Texas Real Estate Commission when\nit drafted the form upon which the clause is based, wherein the Commission stated that the purpose\nof the clause was to “provide for additional incentives for prompt release of the earnest money.”\n31 Tex. Reg. 1446, Comment on Amendment to 22 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 537.28 (2008) (Tex.\nReal Estate Comm'n) (Standard Contract Form TREC No. 20–7).\n\nWe are not holding, however, that a contract can never provide liquidated damages for the failure\nto release earnest money. We hold only that the clause in this case, on its face, did not attempt to\nreasonably forecast a just compensation for a breach of the agreement to release the earnest money.\n\nAccordingly, we sustain issue two.\n\n\n\n                                 SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\nIn issue three, the Magills contend the trial court erred in denying their motion for directed verdict\nbecause there was no evidence that they wrongfully failed or refused to sign a release of the earnest\nmoney.\n\n [20] [21] [22] A complaint about the denial of a motion for directed verdict is the same as\na challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802,\n823 (Tex.2005). Under this standard, we must view the evidence and inferences in the light most\nfavorable to the jury's findings. Id. When, as here, an appellant attacks the legal sufficiency of\nan adverse finding on an issue for which it did not have the burden of proof, it must demonstrate\nthat there is no evidence to support the adverse finding. Croucher v. Croucher, 660 S.W.2d 55,\n58 (Tex.1983). Such a challenge will be sustained only when (1) there is a complete absence of\nevidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or evidence from giving weight\nto the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is\nno more than a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of a vital\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                      8\n\fMagill v. Watson, 409 S.W.3d 673 (2013)\n\n\n\nfact. King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex.2003); see also City of Keller, 168\nS.W.3d at 810.\n\n [23] We have already held that recovery of treble the amount of the earnest money was\nunenforceable, thus the issue of whether there is sufficient evidence that the Magills wrongfully\nfailed or refused to release the earnest money is irrelevant. However, to the extent that the Magills\nare also contesting the jury's finding them liable for breaching the agreement, we note that there is\nevidence that the Magills could have built a 5000 square foot house on the lot, but chose instead\nto terminate the contract because they could not get a variance to permit them to build their garage\nso that it encroached on the setback. Thus, the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury's\nfinding that the Magill's breached the agreement, thus giving rise to damages in the amount of\nthe earnest money.\n\nWe overrule issue three.\n\n\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n\nBecause section 18.D of the contract imposed an unlawful penalty, the trial court *682 erred by\nawarding three times the earnest money, in addition to the earnest money, plus attorney's fees,\ninterest, and costs. However, the evidence is legally sufficient to support an award of liquidated\ndamages in the amount of the earnest money, plus attorney's fees, interest, and costs. Therefore, we\nreverse the judgment awarding the trustees “actual damages of $32,000.00, together with interest\nthereon at the rate of 6% per annum” and render judgment awarding the trustees “actual damages\nof $8,000.00, together with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum.” We affirm the remaining\nportions of the judgment.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                         © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The 134th District\nCourt, Dallas County, Joe B. Burnett, J., instructed a verdict in favor of plaintiffs, and defendants\nappealed. The Court of Civil Appeals, Akin, J., held that: (1) provision in equipment leases\nentitling lessor to repossess equipment and sue for unpaid rentals was an unenforceable penalty\nrather than a liquidated damage provision and, hence, was not a basis for determining actual\ndamages since, upon occurrence of even a minor default, lessor could declare lessee in default,\ntake possession of equipment and, in addition, demand payment of all lease payments called for\nin lease, and (2) summaries of accounts relating to payment made to plaintiffs on equipment\nleases guaranteed by defendants and pertaining to certain payments made and credits due were\ninadmissible hearsay in absence of a showing that original records were voluminous or that\ndefendants had had access to original underlying records.\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\nAttorneys and Law Firms\n\n*573 Philip C.

Four C Corporation neither filed an\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  1\n\fMayfield v. Hicks, 575 S.W.2d 571 (1978)\n\n\n\nanswer nor participated at trial. The trial judge, acting on the provisions of an alleged liquidated\ndamage clause in each lease, granted a default judgment in favor of Dave Hicks Company against\nFour C Corporation for $289,401.08, plus $15,000 in attorneys' fees and also granted a default\njudgment in favor of Dave Hicks, individually, against Four C Corporation for $20,765.51 and\nattorneys' fees of $2,500. 1 Both plaintiffs were then granted an instructed verdict against the\nguarantors.\n\nOnly the guarantors appeal from the trial court's judgment asserting, among other grounds, certain\ndefenses to the leases that go to the question of the liability of Four C *574 Corporation on\nthe leases. In response, appellees argue that guarantor-appellants are collaterally estopped from\nasserting any defenses going to questions relating to the liability of the primary obligor, Four C,\nor to the extent of that liability, since the judgment against Four C is now final. Additionally,\nguarantor-appellants contend that the guaranties were ambiguous, that consideration for the\nguaranties had failed, that attorneys' fees were not recoverable under the guaranties, that all offsets\nand credits had not been allowed them, and that the liquidated damage provision of the lease\nwas a penalty. With respect to the defenses to the leases, we hold that these guarantors are not\ncollaterally estopped and, thus they may assert all defenses available to the primary obligor. We\nalso hold that the “liquidated damage” provision of the lease is a penalty rather than a provision for\njust compensation. Accordingly, we reverse and remand so that appellees may prove their actual\ndamages.\n\n\n                                           Collateral Estoppel\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Appellees argue that the trial court properly instructed a verdict for\nthe appellees because the liability of the primary obligor on the leases had been finally determined\nby the default judgments and that the appellants, as guarantors, are collaterally estopped from\nasserting any defenses to the liability of the primary obligor, Four C Corporation, under the leases.\nIn this respect, they contend that since the judgment is final as to Four C, the rule applies that a\njudgment against the principal obligor conclusively establishes the extent of the principal's liability\nwith respect to a guarantor, if that judgment is obtained in a suit of which the guarantor had full\nknowledge and an opportunity to defend, citing R. G. McClung Cotton Co. v. Cotton Concentration\nCo., 479 S.W.2d 733, 742 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1972, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Empire Steel Corp. v.\nOmni Steel Corp., 378 S.W.2d 905 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth 1964, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Latimer v.\nTexas & N.

Although we agree with the\nprinciple asserted by appellees, it is not applicable to the facts in this case because the guarantors\nhave not had an opportunity to defend which is a predicate to the application of collateral estoppel.\n1 Freeman on Judgments s 447, at 978 (5th ed. 1925). Indeed, in the cases cited by appellees,\nthose courts applied the rule where the primary obligor's liability had been established in an action\nwhere the guarantor had an opportunity to defend but either did not so do or did so unsuccessfully\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    2\n\fMayfield v. Hicks, 575 S.W.2d 571 (1978)\n\n\n\nas in Young v. Bank of Miami, supra, and subsequently attempted to attack that judgment in a\nlater action by the obligee against the guarantor. It is only in this situation that courts have applied\ncollateral estoppel. Here, the guarantors attempted to assert the defenses available to their principal\nin the trial court rather than consciously ignore the opportunity to present such defenses. There\nwas no other opportunity to defend because there had been no prior action. Thus, the general rule\nthat guarantors have the right to raise any defenses to the guaranteed obligation that the principal\nmay have applies. Accordingly, we hold that where a guarantor has notice of the action against his\nprincipal and he takes part in the suit, he is not bound by the adjudication of the principal's liability\nby a default judgment against his principal in the same action. This is true because the guarantor\nmay have had no authority to answer in the principal's behalf or to defend in the name of his\nprincipal. Indeed, before collateral estoppel applies, the opportunity to defend must be such that\nthe guarantor can actually control the suit with respect to any defenses including those available\nto the primary obligor. U. S. Wire & Cable Corp. v. Ascher Corp., 34 N.J. 121, 167 A.2d 633,\n637 (1961). Thus, where the guarantor is merely given notice that the primary obligor expects\nthe guarantor “to assist” in the conduct of the defense, it is insufficient notice or control so as to\npreclude the guarantor from asserting the same defenses in a subsequent suit or in the same suit.\n1 Freeman on Judgments s 449, at 984-85 *575 (5th ed. 1925). Accordingly, we must now turn\nto all points of error asserted by appellants.\n\n\n\n                                       Liquidated Damages or Penalty\n\n [7] Appellants contend that the clauses in both leases which entitle the lessor to repossess the\nequipment and sue for unpaid rentals is an unenforceable penalty, and thus no basis for appellees'\nactual damages. The lessors argue, however, that the provision is a valid stipulation of liquidated\ndamages, for which the lessee became liable upon default. We agree with appellants that the\nprovision is a penalty rather than a liquidated damage provision and that the question of actual\ndamages should be submitted to the jury. The provision in each lease provides:\n         Upon the occurrence of an event of Default, and at any time thereafter, Lessor,\n         in addition to any other rights and remedies he may have, Shall have the right\n         to . . . Take possession of the Equipment, whereupon Lessee's right to use the same\n         under and subject to the terms and provision of this Lease, and any other right or\n         interest of Lessee to or in the Equipment shall absolutely cease, But such taking\n         by Lessor shall not relieve Lessee of its obligations and liabilities hereunder . . . .\n         If Lessor repossesses the Equipment, Lessor shall have the right, at his option, to\n         lease the Equipment to any other party . . . or Lessor may sell the Equipment or\n         salvage the valuable components thereof. In the event of any such leasing or sale,\n         There shall be due from Lessee, and Lessee will immediately pay to Lessor, the\n         difference between the amount of rentals to be received from any third person,\n         or the purchase price at said sale, as the case may be, And the total unpaid rental\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hicks, 575 S.W.2d 571 (1978)\n\n\n\n         and other amounts to be paid herein, plus all costs and expenses of Lessor in\n         repossessing, transporting, repairing, releasing, selling or otherwise handling the\n         equipment. (Emphasis added)\n\n\nThe vice in this provision that makes it a penalty rather than a liquidated damage provision is that\nupon the occurrence of even a minor default by the lessee, the lessor may then declare the lessee in\ndefault, take possession of the equipment, and, in addition, demand payment of all lease payments\ncalled for in the lease. The coupling of repossession with acceleration of rent, irrespective of\nthe type of breach, is the defect in this provision. It is immaterial that the actual breach was for\nnonpayment of rentals. A provision is a penalty if it provides for unreasonable payments for a\nminor breach. For example, the leases here provide that an event of default occurs if the lessee\ndoes not punctually perform any of the obligations contained in the leases and the leases obligate\nthe lessee to keep the equipment in good appearance. Conceivably, if the lessee did not punctually\nkeep the equipment in good appearance, then the lessor could declare the lessee to be in default.\nSuch a minor breach could then lead to draconian penalties disproportionate to any actual damage\nthat the lessors may suffer. In Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484, 487 (1952), the\nsupreme court condemned a similar provision as a penalty because the lease provided the same\nreparation for breach of each and every covenant in the lease, thus violating the principle of just\ncompensation. Consequently, that court concluded that the provision in that case to be a penalty\nrather than a provision for liquidated damages. Since the clause in our case subjects the lessee to\nthe same reparation for the breach of any covenant, we likewise hold that the provision is a penalty\nrather than one for liquidated damages. United States Leasing Corp. v. Smith, 555 S.W.2d 766,\n770 (Tex.Civ.App.-Tyler 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Annot., 104 A.L.R. 132 (1936); 5 Williston on\nContracts s 779 (3rd ed. 1961).\n\n [8] Although appellees pleaded that the breach was for unpaid rentals, it does not save the\nprovision from being a penalty because that question turns on whether the provision provides for\nreasonable compensation. Of course, it would be unreasonable to permit the lessor to repossess\nand to require the lessee or its guarantors to pay the entire rentals set forth in the lease for *576\nany insignificant, technical breach. Thus, the question of whether the provision is a penalty or a\nliquidated damage clause is determined by the reasonableness of the provision with respect to just\ncompensation. Since we have held this provision to be a penalty, it will not support the damages\nin the judgment instructed by the trial court. On remand the question of actual damages is one of\nproof to be determined by the jury.\n\n [9] Nevertheless, appellees argue that the instructed verdict was proper because appellants failed\nto request proper special issues inquiring whether the liquidated damage clause was a penalty. We\ncannot agree because any jury issues pertaining to whether a contractual clause is enforceable as\na liquidated damage provision or void as a penalty are immaterial since this determination is a\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hicks, 575 S.W.2d 571 (1978)\n\n\n\nquestion of law for the trial court, rather than a jury question and must be viewed as of the time\nthe contract was executed. Schepps v. American District Telegraph Co. of Texas, 286 S.W.2d\n684, 690 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1955, no writ); Zucht v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co., 207 S.W.2d\n414, 418 (Tex.Civ.App.-San Antonio 1947, writ dism'd ); Muller v. Light, 538 S.W.2d 487, 488\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Thus, appellees' contention lacks merit. Since we\nhave held that the trial court erred in instructing a verdict, we turn now to other questions that\nmay arise upon retrial.\n\n\n\n                                             Attorneys' Fees\n\n [10] Appellants contend next that the trial court erred in granting judgment against them\nfor attorneys' fees under the guaranties. They assert that although the lease obligated Four C\nCorporation to pay attorneys' fees, since the guaranty agreement does not expressly provide for\nattorneys' fees, the guarantor is not liable for them, citing Miller v. Bush, 42 S.W.2d 156, 159\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Waco 1931, writ ref'd). Miller is not, however, controlling because in that case\nthe attorneys' fees were not allowed because neither the guaranty nor the obligation guaranteed\nprovided for attorneys' fees. Consequently, that court applied the rule that guarantors are not liable\nfor attorneys' fees, unless they are provided for in the contract guaranteed, or, if that contract is\nsilent with respect to attorneys' fees, unless the guaranty so provides. In this case the contract\nguaranteed expressly provides for attorneys' fees and the guaranty agreement specifically binds\nthe guarantor to pay all indebtedness incurred by the lessor by reason of the lessor's default.\nThis, of course, includes attorneys' fees incurred in asserting the rights of the obligee. Since the\nlease agreements provide for attorneys' fees against the principal obligor, and since the guaranties\ncover any and all indebtedness that the primary obligor may owe, the attorneys' fees are included\nas a part of the guaranteed debt. Gubitosi v. Schoellkopf Products, Inc., 545 S.W.2d 528, 538\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Tyler 1976, no writ); Young v. J. F. Zimmerman & Son, Inc., 434 S.W.2d 926, 927\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Waco 1968, writ dism'd); McGhee v. Wynnewood State Bank, 297 S.W.2d 876,\n884 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1957, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Accordingly, we hold that trial court properly\nconcluded that attorneys' fees were recoverable from the guarantors.\n\n\n\n                                                 Interest\n\n [11] Additionally, appellants complain of the refusal of the trial court to admit evidence showing\nthat certain sums allegedly guaranteed by appellants Wharton and Mayfield were interest, and,\ntherefore, not within the guaranty. In this respect, they contend that, as a matter of law, these\nguarantors cannot be made liable for interest. We cannot agree. Since the lease provides for interest\nand since that is the contract guaranteed, the trial court properly permitted recovery of interest on\nthe same rationale as that of attorneys' fees, discussed Supra.\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

They assert that these summaries were\nhearsay since the proper predicate for their admission into evidence under Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann.\nart. 3737e (Vernon Supp.1978) was not laid. We agree because it was not shown that the original\nrecords were voluminous or that appellants had had access to the original underlying records.\nBlack Lake Pipe Line Co. v. Union Construction Co., 538 S.W.2d 80, 93-94 (Tex.1976); Hanson\nSouthwest Corp. v. Dal-Mac Construction Co., 554 S.W.2d 712, 723 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1977,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.).\n\n\n\n                                               Consideration\n\n [13] Appellants also assert that the instructed verdict was improper because there were issues\nraised by the evidence as to whether the guaranty agreements were supported by consideration. In\nthis respect, they contend that they presented evidence that the guarantors were to receive stock\nor stock options in Four C Corporation as consideration for acting as guarantors and that since\nthe guarantors failed to receive this stock, there was no consideration for the execution of the\nguaranties. Whether appellants failed to receive stock from the primary obligor is immaterial.\nRather, our question is whether consideration exists between the plaintiffs and the guarantors. In\nthis respect sufficient consideration exists if the primary obligor receives some benefit. Bonner Oil\nCo. v. Gaines, 108 Tex. 232, 191 S.W. 552 (1917); Hargis v. Radio Corp. of America, Electronic\nComponents, 539 S.W.2d 230, 232 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1976, no writ); Estes v. Oilfield Salvage\nCo., 284 S.W.2d 201, 204 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1955, no writ). Here it is undisputed that the\nequipment covered by both of these leases was delivered to Four C in reliance on the guaranties\nand that the primary obligor received the benefit of its bargain. We conclude, therefore, that this\ncontention is without merit.\n\n [14] Appellants next contend that since the guaranties were executed after the leases, the\nconsideration for the leases cannot also serve as consideration for the guaranties. We cannot\nagree. Before addressing the merits of this contention, we first note that all written contracts\nare presumed to be supported by consideration. Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 27 (Vernon 1969);\nUnthank v. Rippstein, 386 S.W.2d 134, 138 (Tex.1964); Maykus v.

Hicks, 575 S.W.2d 571 (1978)\n\n\n\nconsideration and the burden is on appellants to show lack of consideration. Maykus, Supra, at\n398. This appellants have failed to do.\n\n [15] [16] Finally, appellants urge that since there were questions of fact as to whether the lease\nagreements and guaranties were executed several months apart, consideration for the leases cannot\nserve as consideration for the guaranties. One guaranty shows that it was executed six days after\nthe lease; however, the date on the other guaranty was identical to the date of the lease. Some\ntestimony was to the effect that some of the guarantors actually signed the guaranties as long as\nseveral months after the lease. The evidence is, however, undisputed that the guarantors would\nexecute the guaranties and that without the guaranties the lessors would not furnish the equipment.\nWe conclude that appellants' contention lacks merit. In Maykus v. Texas Bank & Trust Co. of\nDallas, 550 S.W.2d 396, 398 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1977, no writ), the promissory note was dated\nAugust 8, 1973, and the guaranty was dated August 15, 1973, and the argument was advanced\nby appellant that this shifted the burden to appellee to show new consideration. In rejecting this\ncontention, we stated that this apparent discrepancy did not refute the presumption of consideration\ninherent in the guaranty agreement, and, therefore, held that:\n         (M)ere evidence of a time discrepancy in execution between a note and a written\n         guaranty agreement is legally insufficient to rebut the statutory presumption of\n         consideration which supports a separate guaranty accord.\n\n\n *578 Thus, the mere fact that a guaranty agreement was executed subsequent to the passing of\nconsideration for the principal obligation does not rebut the statutory presumption of consideration\nnor does it shift the burden of proof to the plaintiffs to show additional consideration.\n\n\n\n                                                Ambiguity\n\n [17] [18] Finally, appellants argue that the trial court erred in refusing to submit issues to the jury\nwith respect to their allegation that the guaranties are ambiguous and further, that the trial court\nerred in determining as a matter of law that the guaranties were not ambiguous. Appellants urge\nthat the guaranties are ambiguous because the agreements provide in one part that all guarantors\nare “jointly and severally” liable and that they bind themselves to pay “any and all indebtedness”\nwhich would indicate a general liability of each signer for the total indebtedness as set out in the\nequipment leases, and then the same instrument later provides that “the undersigned shall not be\nrequired to pay the lessor hereunder more than the sum set out adjacent to the undersigned names.”\nThus, appellants contend that on the face of the instrument it calls for two different liabilities. We\ncannot agree. First, it was not error for the trial judge to refuse to submit issues on the alleged\nambiguity of the guaranties because the question of whether a written agreement is ambiguous\nis a question of law for the court, rather than for a jury question.

Secondly, a reading of the guaranty agreements\nclearly indicates that the agreements are capable of only one meaning and that is that each guarantor\nis jointly and severally liable for the indebtedness of Four C Corporation under each lease except\nthat none of the guarantors can be required to pay more than the amount stated by each guarantor's\nname. Accordingly, the guaranty agreements were not ambiguous.\n\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    These default judgments have now become final since no appeal was taken from them.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                    © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We will\naffirm.\n\nCintas Corporation is a national company that rents uniforms, towels and mats to businesses on a\nweekly basis. Murphy owns and *665 operates an Exxon and Chevron service station in Tyler,\nTexas. From 1988 until 1991, Murphy and Cintas entered into a series of contracts to rent uniforms.\nInitially, Cintas filed suit against Murphy alleging that he had failed to pay in accordance with their\nagreements which resulted in $8,724.59 in damages. As exhibits to its petition, Cintas attached the\ncontracts, the invoices and Cintas's affidavit stating that the claim against Murphy was just and\ntrue, that it was due, and that all just and lawful credit had been allowed. TEX.R.CIV.P. 185.\n\nMurphy answered by an unsworn denial, but alleged that Cintas “fail[ed] to furnish clean, high\nquality garments and fail[ed] to replace torn, damaged and worn garments when requested.”\nMurphy also alleged that Cintas was not entitled to recover liquidated damages because the\nliquidated damage provision was an unenforceable penalty. After a non-jury hearing, the court\nrendered judgment in favor of Cintas. Neither party requested findings of fact and conclusions\nof law.\n\nIn points one, two, three, four, five, six and eight, Murphy challenges the legal sufficiency of the\nevidence to support the court's award of liquidated damages. According to Murphy, the record\nis void of any evidence regarding the amount of monetary loss that Cintas actually suffered as a\nresult of the breach or the reasonableness of the liquidated damage provision. He also argues that\nthe record is void of any evidence that the amount of liquidated damages was a reasonable forecast\nof just compensation. Therefore, Murphy concludes that the court erred when it awarded damages\nin accordance with the liquidated damage provision of the contract rather than awarding damages\nin accordance with common law contract law. We do not agree.\n\n [1] [2] [3] When findings and conclusions are neither requested nor filed, the trial court is\npresumed to have made all of the findings necessary to support its judgment. Roberson v. Robinson,\n768 S.W.2d 280, 281 (Tex.1989). All questions of fact are presumed found in support of the\njudgment and the judgment will be upheld on any legal theory raised by the evidence. Point\nLookout West, Inc. v. Whorton, 742 S.W.2d 277, 278–79 (Tex.1987). Further, Murphy's points\nof error are “no evidence” points.

Had Cintas properly filed a suit on a sworn account in accordance\nwith Rule 185, and Murphy had failed to file a written denial under oath, Murphy could not have\ndenied Cintas's claim, he could not have disputed that he received the services, and he could not\nhave disputed the correctness of the stated charges.

CRB Marketing, Inc., 566 S.W.2d 573, 575 (Tex.1978).\nHowever, a lawsuit involving a breach of a lease agreement is not a valid claim on sworn account\nbecause a lease agreement does not involve a purchase and sale, and title to personal property\nhas not passed from one party to another. Id. Thus, we hold that Cintas's cause of action against\nMurphy is not a suit on sworn account as a matter of law. Id.\n\n [8] [9] Having determined that the court rendered judgment in favor of Cintas under a breach of\ncontract, we will determine whether there is any evidence to support the damage award. Murphy\nargues that, because Cintas did not offer proof of its actual damages, there was no evidence in\nthe record to show that the liquidated damage provision in the contract was reasonable. As an\naffirmative defense to Cintas's claim for liquidated damages, Murphy pled penalty. TEX.R.CIV.P.\n94; *666 Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 789 (Tex.1991). In doing so, Murphy not Cintas\nhad the burden to prove that the liquidated damage provision was unreasonable and a penalty.\nGorman v. Life Ins. Co. of North America, 811 S.W.2d 542, 546 (Tex.1991). Murphy did not offer\nany evidence to prove the amount of Cintas' actual damages. Accordingly, points one, two, three,\nfour, five, six and eight are overruled.\n\n[10] In his seventh point, Murphy contends that the court erred when it awarded Cintas liquidated\ndamages because the contractual provision was, as a matter of law, an unenforceable penalty. The\ndisputed liquidated damage clause stated:\n\n            In the event of cancellation of this service agreement by the Customer prior to\n            the termination date, other than for failure of the Company to perform under its\n            guarantee, the Customer will pay the greater of 50% of the weekly service charge\n            per person per week for the unexpired term, or buy back all of the garments in\n            inventory at the rates listed above as replacement value.\n\nCiting Servisco v.

In Servisco, the court held that “a sum stipulated to be paid under an\nagreement should be treated as an unenforceable penalty if the agreement contains several matters\nof different degrees of importance and the sum stipulated is payable for the breach of any, even the\nleast.” Murphy argues that, under the language of the Cintas–Murphy agreement, Murphy could\nhave been liable for the same amount of damages whether he breached the agreement by failing to\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Murphy also contends that the harm caused by the breach\nmust not be capable of estimation or difficult to estimate to be an enforceable liquidated damage\nstipulation. Because employees of Cintas testified that documentation of the actual damage that\nCintas incurred as a result of the breach were available at the time of trial, Murphy concludes that\nCintas admitted that the liquidated damage provision was unenforceable.\n\nIn Stewart v. Basey, the Supreme Court considered the difference between an enforceable\nliquidated damage provision and an unenforceable penalty. Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245\nS.W.2d 484 (1952). More recently, the courts have restated this two-part Stewart test when\nanalyzing the validity of a contractual damages provision:\n\n  In order to enforce a liquidated damage clause, the court must find:\n\n  (1) that the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation; and\n\n  (2) that the amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just\n     compensation.\n\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. For the provision to be an unenforceable penalty, the uncertainty of the\ndamages and the reasonableness of the stipulation must have existed at the time when the contract\nwas executed. Oetting v. Flake Uniform & Linen Service, 553 S.W.2d 793, 796 (Tex.Civ.App.—\nFt. Worth 1977, no writ). Even though Murphy contends that the actual damage incurred by Cintas\ncould have been calculated at the time of trial, such testimony was long after the contract between\nCintas and Murphy had been executed. To forecast the actual damages to Cintas as a result of\nMurphy's termination of the contract sixty months in advance would be fraught with uncertainty.\nFurther, similar contracts for liquidated damages have been approved in Liberty Sign Co. v.\nNewsom, 426 S.W.2d 210 (Tex.1968); Blakeway v. National Credit Corporation, 439 S.W.2d 155\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1969, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Blakeway v. General Electric Credit Corporation,\n429 S.W.2d 925 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1968, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Hyde v. Claude Neon Federal Co.,\n157 S.W.2d 952 (Tex.Civ.App.—Eastland 1941, writ dism'd); White v. Wilbanks, 144 S.W.2d 941\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Amarillo 1940, no writ). Accordingly, we hold that the liquidated *667 damage\nclause is enforceable. Point seven is overruled.\n\n [11] In his last point of error, Murphy contends that the court erred when it refused to set aside\nthe judgment and render a take-nothing judgment in his favor. However, he failed to cite any\nauthority to support his position. Under Rule 74(f), Murphy's point is not preserved for our review.\nTEX.R.APP.P. 74(f); Tobias v. Univ. of Texas at Arlington, 824 S.W.2d 201, 206–07 (Tex.App.\n—Fort Worth 1991, writ denied).\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Cintas Corp., 923 S.W.2d 663 (1996)\n\n\n\n [12] In one cross-point, Cintas contends that the court erred when it allowed Murphy to file a trial\namendment after the case had been heard by the court. According to Cintas, Murphy had failed to\nplead the defense of penalty to the contract action under Rule 94 until after both parties had closed\nand the court had taken the case under advisement.

Oetting as guarantor of the obligations of The Baker Corporation\nunder two garment rental contracts with Flake Uniform & Linen Service, Inc. Baker Corporation\nfailed to pay its monthly obligation and Flake Uniform obtained judgment for liquidated damages.\nOetting appeals on the ground the contract provision for liquidated damages is unenforceable\nbecause it provides for a penalty.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n *795 This suit originally was brought by Flake Uniform against The Baker Corporation, and\nHoward W. Oetting, Tommy Baker and Maurice Baker, individually. The Baker Corporation\nbecame insolvent and ceased doing business and the plaintiff was unable to serve either of the two\nBakers who were dismissed from the suit. Baker Corporation as customer and Flake Uniform as\nsupplier entered into an original garment rental contract on March 13, 1972, and a second contract\ndated February 10, 1975. In June, 1975, the parties entered into an amendment to the garment\nrental contract and a guaranty agreement. In summary form, the guaranty agreement recited that\nBaker Corporation was in default in various sums of money under the terms of existing contracts.\nThe parties agreed to the amount of these obligations and that such indebtedness had matured and\nalso agreed to pay attorney fees but provided that these past due installments should be paid in\nsix monthly installments.\n\nThe other parties to the suit guaranteed the payment of these obligations. A third cause of action\nwas for the payment of various checks that had been paid for this service which had been\ndishonored by the bank. The fourth cause of action was for the sum of $15,495.66 as liquidated\ndamages for the loss of profits for the balance of the term of the rental agreement. The fifth cause\nof action was for the failure to return to plaintiff uniforms that had been supplied to The Baker\nCorporation, and the sixth cause of action was for attorney fees as provided for in the contracts.\n\nAfter Oetting had been served and answered, Flake Uniform filed detailed request for admissions\ncovering the entire transactions in all the matters in controversy and included in said request for\nadmissions a request that Oetting admit the allegations of fact in each paragraph of plaintiff's\npetition. These were each by separate request.\n\nOetting did not answer the request for admissions and a motion was filed for an order deeming\nthe request for admissions to be admitted. This was not contested and the court rendered judgment\nand signed an order deeming admitted all the request for admissions and allegations contained in\nplaintiff's trial pleadings.\n\nFlake Uniform filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The court granted this summary\njudgment for all sums of money due under the contracts and for services that had theretofore been\nrendered. This was in the sum of $4,860.77.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 2\n\fOetting v. Flake Uniform & Linen Service, Inc., 553 S.W.2d 793 (1977)\n\n\n\n\nThere was no dispute concerning the provision for liquidated damages for the breach of the contract\nfrom the date of its termination, because of non payment of the monthly service charge that would\naccrue in the future, until the end of the term of the contract. This sum was in the amount of\n$15,495.66 plus interest and attorney fees. The remainder of the case was then tried before the\ncourt without a jury and resulted in the court making the partial summary judgment final and\nincorporating it into the final judgment and awarded Flake Uniform 85% of the amounts it would\nhave received had the contract been fully performed after the date it was terminated because of\nthe non payment of the monthly sums due, plus all amounts owing before the termination, plus\n$3,174.37 attorney fees and interest.\n [1] No findings of fact or conclusions of law were filed and the record does not reflect that any\nwere requested. Therefore, if there is any legal theory supported by the evidence on which to\naffirm, this court must do so. Smitheal v. Smitheal, 518 S.W.2d 842 (Tex. Civ. App., Fort Worth\n1975, writ dism'd), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 928, 96 S.Ct. 277, 46 L.Ed.2d 256.\n\n [2] These contracts provide for actual damages. Both contracts show on their face that the\nascertainment of damages is difficult, at best. The defendant, by both allegation and proof, must\nraise the issue and assume the burden of proving the amount of the actual damages for the purpose\nof showing an absence of approximation between the actual loss and the stipulated sum. Smith\nv. Lane, 236 S.W.2d 214 (Tex. Civ. App., San Antonio 1950, no writ). *796 See also Southern\nPlow Co. v. Dunlap Hardware Co., 236 S.W. 765 (Tex. Civ. App., Dallas 1922, no writ); Walsh\nv. Methodist Episcopal Church, 212 S.W. 950 (Tex. Com. App. 1919, jdgmt. adopted).\n\n [3] It follows then that plaintiff need not allege or prove actual damages where it cannot be said\nthat the damages were certain, apparent or ascertainable. Pippin Bros. v. Thompson, 292 S.W.\n618 (Tex. Civ. App., Waco 1927, writ dism'd); Schwarz v. Lee, 287 S.W. 519 (Tex. Civ. App.,\nFort Worth 1926, writ dism'd); McElroy v. Danciger, 241 S.W. 1098 (Tex. Civ. App., Amarillo\n1922, no writ).\n\n [4] In Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484 (1952), the court stated that to be\nenforceable as liquidated damages the damages must be uncertain and a stipulation must be\nreasonable. This must have existed at the time when the contract was executed. What the courts\nreally do, in this type of case, is to permit the parties to estimate in advance the amount of damages,\nprovided they adhere to the principle of just compensation. That court then stated: “Restatement\nof Contracts, Sec. 339, accurately expresses the rule as follows:\n“ ‘(1) An agreement, made in advance of breach fixing the damages therefor, is not enforceable\nas a contract and does not affect the damages recoverable for the breach, unless\n\n\n“ ‘(a) the amount so fixed is a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm that is caused\nby the breach, and\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Flake Uniform & Linen Service, Inc., 553 S.W.2d 793 (1977)\n\n\n\n\n“ ‘(b) the harm that is caused by the breach is one that is incapable or very difficult of accurate\nestimation.’ ”\n\nOetting assigns only two points of error to the effect that the liquidated damage provision is\nunreasonable in view of the nature of the several breaches upon which it is possible for it to become\noperative and it is unreasonable due to the amount of damages stipulated.\n\nParagraph A of the General Terms and Conditions of the contract provides, in pertinent part, “. . .\nUpon the failure of the Customer to pay Supplier as set out above, Supplier may, at its option,\nterminate this Agreement and, if Supplier so elects, then the provisions of paragraph D below shall\napply. . . .”\n\nParagraph D provides:\n\n“Inasmuch as the breach of this Agreement by Customer will cause a serious and substantial\ndamage to Supplier, and because it will be difficult if not impossible to prove the amount of such\ndamage, Customer agrees that in case of breach of this Agreement by failure to pay Supplier as\nagreed, or by reason of any other breach on the part of Customer, it will pay to Supplier within\nten (10) days after the date of termination all accrued charges for garment rentals incurred prior to\nthe date of termination together with an additional amount of money equal to 85% of the Rental\nCharges which Customer would have been obligated to pay Supplier for garment rental from the\ndate of termination until the end of the existing Contract Period as liquidated damages; such sum\nbeing agreed upon by the Supplier and by the Customer as the amount which Supplier will be\ndamaged by breach of this Agreement on the part of Customer.”\n [5] It is clear that Paragraph D, the liquidated damage provision, can only be invoked in the\ncase of termination of the entire contract, since the measure of damages is 85% of the charge if\nperformed, after the date of termination until the end of the contract period. There is no provision\nallowing termination of the contract, except in paragraph A, in the case of breach by failure to pay.\nTherefore, the liquidated damage provision can only come into play if: (1) the customer fails to\npay as agreed; and (2) the supplier terminates the contract.\n\n\nIt is true that paragraph D also recites “. . . or by reason of any other breach on the part of\nCustomer, . . .” but that appears to have been inserted in an abundance of caution, since termination\nmust occur, and can only occur on nonpayment. The clause is mere surplusage, and can have\nno effect. Only the most major *797 breach of all, nonpayment, can trigger paragraph D, and\nliquidated damages. This was not the situation in Stewart v. Basey, supra, where the breach was\ntrivial.\n\nWe overrule point of error no. 1.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Flake Uniform & Linen Service, Inc., 553 S.W.2d 793 (1977)\n\n\n\n\nThe judgment recites that “. . . the liquidated damage provision set forth in the Garment Rental\nContract between the parties is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by\nthe breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise\nobtaining an adequate remedy. . . .”\n [6] As noted above, that judgment must be affirmed if it can be upheld on any legal theory\nsupported by the evidence. Further, we are obliged to consider only that evidence which tends\nto support the court's finding, disregarding all that which is opposed to it. Smitheal v. Smitheal,\nsupra; Renfro Drug Co. v. Lewis, 149 Tex. 507, 235 S.W.2d 609 (1950).\n\n\nThe only witness who testified was Leon Edward Flake, who is president of plaintiff's corporation.\nIn order to service the Baker contract, Flake had to obtain the sizes of the employees who were\ngoing to use the uniforms; buy new pants, shirts and uniforms; place thereon the name of the\ncompany, the name of the employee and other material; and replace them when they became worn\nand when employees would terminate and were replaced by other employees. He had a vast stock\nof used uniforms which he valued at 5¢ each. He attempted to replace worn uniforms with used\nclothing but, if he could not, the new ones cost approximately $12.50 each. These uniforms were\npicked up by a route man and the laundry was done in lots so that each driver's entire pickup\nload of clothing was washed in one machine, no matter what size the load. Flake operated several\ncompanies, including a chemical company and unrelated businesses, out of his central place of\nbusiness. His route man serviced an account across the street from Flake Uniform. His route\nmen were on salary. His bookkeeping was done by salaried personnel for this business and other\nunrelated businesses. Their salary remained the same after the Baker account was terminated.\nThere was no difference in his cost of operation or his overhead after the Baker account was\nterminated. The major cost was a “front-end” cost, in that the uniforms were purchased and sized;\nthe emblems and advertisement were purchased and placed thereon; the collars and waistbands\nwere taped for identification; and the salesmen were paid a commission when the contracts were\nobtained.\n\nFlake further testified that the fact that The Baker Corporation dropped out didn't cause his cost\nto go down any. “My revenue just ceased . . . from that particular account.”\n\nUnder the facts in this case it would be very difficult to determine in advance what actual damages\nwould be sustained as a result of Baker Corporation's failing to pay its rental contract and the\ncontract then having to be terminated.\n\nWe have examined with care the cases cited in support of the contentions made by Oetting. In\neach instance, we concluded that the authorities relied upon by Oetting are distinguishable from\nthe cases we consider controlling.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Flake Uniform & Linen Service, Inc., 553 S.W.2d 793 (1977)\n\n\n\n [7] We hold that the stipulations for liquidated damages are reasonable and find that, when\nthe contract was made, the actual damages were uncertain. Any attempt to establish the actual\ndamages would be fraught with such uncertainties and difficulty as to require this court to sustain\nthe agreements in this case for liquidated damages. Similar contracts for liquidated damages have\nbeen approved in Blakeway v. National Credit Corporation, 439 S.W.2d 155 (Tex. Civ. App.,\nAustin 1969, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Blakeway v.

Newsom, 426 S.W.2d 210 (Tex. 1968).\n\n\nUnder the undisputed facts in this case reflecting that there was practically no decrease in expenses\nof operation of the supplier and the difficulty of ascertaining the actual damages, the finding of\nthe court that 85% of the rental charges that Baker would have paid, if he had fully performed the\ncontract is a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm that was caused by the breach\nand that this harm was incapable or very difficult of accurate estimation at the time the contract\nwas executed.\n\nWe overrule point of error no. 2.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nEnd of Document                                               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (1991)\n\n\n\nDuring 32 years of marriage, Harry and Martha Phillips accumulated over $18 million in\ncommunity property, primarily through the oil and gas business Harry managed. When they\ndivorced, rather than break up their oil and gas holdings, they created Phillips & Phillips, Ltd., a\nlimited partnership, and transferred the bulk of their assets to it. Each had an equal interest in the\npartnership. Harry, the only general partner, agreed to work for the partnership full-time without\nsalary and to offer Martha the option to participate in any business opportunities he pursued outside\nthe partnership. Martha, the only limited partner, agreed that she would have no right to participate\nin Harry's business decisions for the partnership and that she would leave each of her four children\nby Harry at least one-sixth of her estate.\n\nThe partnership agreement required Harry to pay himself and Martha each a minimum *787 of\n$21,000 per month for 24 months, and then minimum monthly distributions adjusted for inflation\nand for oil and gas prices. It also required Harry to furnish Martha certain financial information\nabout the partnership and to cooperate with her in auditing its affairs. The agreement contained\nthe following provision: “If the general partner breaches his trust hereunder, he shall pay to the\nlimited partner as liquidated damages ten times the amount she loses as a result of such breaches\nof trust. Errors of judgment shall not be considered breaches of trusts.”\n\nThe value of the partnership increased under Harry's management, but Harry did not fully comply\nwith the terms of the written agreement. In particular, after the first 20 months Harry distributed\nmuch less than the required minimum amounts, never actually calculating what payments the\nagreement required. He also failed to provide timely annual statements of operations and refused\nto cooperate fully with Martha's attempts to audit the partnership.\n\nMartha eventually sued Harry for dissolution of the partnership and damages based upon Harry's\nbreach of contractual and fiduciary duties. The case was tried to a jury, who found that Harry\nbreached the partnership agreement by favoring himself in paying his personal expenses and\nencumbering partnership assets, thus endangering partnership distributions. The jury also found\nthat Harry breached both the partnership agreement and his fiduciary duty to Martha by failing to\nkeep current and complete partnership books, failing to prepare required annual statements, and\ninterfering with Martha's efforts to examine partnership books and records. 1 The jury assessed\nMartha's actual damages at $300,000. None of the jury's findings are challenged by the parties\non appeal.\n\nDuring the trial the parties stipulated that a reasonable fee for legal services necessary for Martha's\nprosecution of the case was $235,302.14. The jury was aware of this stipulation, and the trial court\nsurmised that the jury included this amount in its $300,000 finding. Accordingly, the trial court\nrendered judgment for Martha for a total of $300,000, $235,302.14 against the partnership and\n$64,697.86 against Harry, and refused to award Martha any additional amount for attorney fees.\nThe trial court also ordered the partnership dissolved.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court of appeals held that the trial court erred in refusing to\naward Martha the $235,302.14 stipulated attorney fees in addition to the $300,000 damages found\nby the jury, but that the trial court did not err in refusing to award Martha decuple damages under\nthe partnership agreement. Consequently, the appeals court reversed the judgment of the trial court\nin part and rendered judgment against Harry for a total of $535,302.14, plus interest. 2\n\n *788 Martha contends that she is entitled to recover liquidated damages equal to ten times\nthe actual damages found by the jury, as provided by the limited partnership agreement. Harry\ncontends that the contractual provision is not an enforceable agreement for liquidated damages but\nan unenforceable penalty. Martha argues that even if Harry is correct, he has waived any defense\nof penalty by failing to plead it as an affirmative defense.\n\n [1] We first considered the difference between an enforceable liquidated damages provision and\nan unenforceable penalty in Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484, 485–486 (1952).\nThere we explained:\n\n   Volumes have been written on the question of when a stipulated damage provision of a contract\n   should be enforced as liquidated damages and when enforcement should be denied because it is\n   a penalty provision.... All agree that to be enforceable as liquidated damages the damages must\n   be uncertain and the stipulation must be reasonable.\n\n.....\n\n   The right of competent parties to make their own bargains is not unlimited. The universal rule\n   for measuring damages for the breach of a contract is just compensation for the loss or damage\n   actually sustained. By the operation of that rule a party generally should be awarded neither\n   less nor more than his actual damages. A party has no right to have a court enforce a stipulation\n   which violates the principle underlying that rule.\n\nMore recently, in Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers, Inc. v. Campesi, 592 S.W.2d 340, 342 n. 2\n(Tex.1979), we restated the two-part Stewart test for determining whether to enforce a contractual\ndamages provision as follows: “In order to enforce a liquidated damage clause, the court must\nfind: (1) that the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) that\nthe amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.” Cf.\nTEX.BUS. & COM.CODE § 2.718(a). 3\n\n[2] Whether a contractual provision is an enforceable liquidated damages provision or an\nunenforceable penalty is a question of law for the court to decide. Farrar v. Beeman, 63 Tex. 175,\n181 (1885); see Lefevere v. Sears, 629 S.W.2d 768, 771 (Tex.Civ.App.—El Paso 1981, no writ);\nMuller v.

Huffhines, 244 S.W. 847, 849 (Tex.Civ.App.—Amarillo 1922, writ dism'd).\nSometimes, however, factual issues must be resolved before the legal question can be decided. For\nexample, to show that a liquidated damages provision is unreasonable because the actual damages\nincurred were much less than the amount contracted for, a defendant may be required to prove\nwhat the actual damages were. See Johnson Eng'rs, Inc. v. Tri–Water Supply Corp., 582 S.W.2d\n555, 557 (Tex.Civ.App.—Texarkana 1979, no writ); Oetting v. Flake Uniform & Linen Serv.,\nInc., 553 S.W.2d 793, 796–797 (Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1977, no writ); *789 Smith v.

Methodist\nEpiscopal Church, 212 S.W. 950, 952 (Tex.Comm'n App.1919, judgm't adopted).\n\n [3] [4] The enforceability of the contractual provision in this case involves no fact issues. A\ncontractual provision like the one here by which one party agrees to pay the other some multiple\nof actual damages for breach of the agreement does not meet either part of the legal test for\nan enforceable liquidated damages provision. It cannot meet the first prong of the test because\nthe harm caused by the breach of the contract is not incapable or difficult of estimation. The\nprovision assumes actual damages can and will be determined, indeed must be determined, before\nthe prescribed multiplier can be applied. The provision cannot meet the second prong of the test\nbecause, instead of attempting to forecast actual damages, it calls for them to be determined and\nthen multiplied. Cf. Robert G. Beneke & Co. v. Cole, 550 S.W.2d 321 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas\n1977, no writ) (contract provision which fixes liquidated damages without excluding additional\nliability for actual damages is not a reasonable forecast of just compensation and therefore a\npenalty). A contractual provision like the one in this case is thus, on its face, an unenforceable\npenalty.\n\n [5] [6] Harry, however, did not plead penalty as an affirmative defense to an award of damages\nunder the liquidated damages provision in the partnership agreement. Although penalty is not\namong the affirmative defenses enumerated in Rule 94, TEX.R.CIV.P., the listing in that rule\nis not exclusive. Penalty is, in the language of the rule, a “matter constituting an avoidance or\naffirmative defense.” Johnson, 582 S.W.2d at 557; Oetting, 553 S.W.2d at 795–796; Robinson v.\nGranite Equip.

Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (1991)\n\n\n\n\n [7] One exception to this rule is the defense of illegality, a defense specifically listed in Rule 94.\n“[I]f the illegal nature of the document to be relied upon or sought to be enforced is apparent from\nthe plaintiff's pleadings, it is not necessary that illegality be specially pleaded by the defendant\nin order to rely upon it as a defense.” Lewkowicz v. El Paso Apparel Corp., 625 S.W.2d 301,\n303 (Tex.1981); accord Niles v. Harris County Fresh Water Supply Dist., 339 S.W.2d 562, 563\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Waco 1960, writ ref'd); Reid v. Associated Employers Lloyds, 164 S.W.2d 584,\n585–586 (Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1942, writ ref'd); Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Lusk, 52\nS.W.2d 1110 (Tex.Civ.App.—Waco 1932, writ ref'd); Texas & P. Coal Co. v. Lawson, 89 Tex.\n394, 34 S.W. 919, 921 (1896). Two principles support this exception to the general rule that\naffirmative defenses are waived if not pleaded. One is that “[w]hen a plaintiff in his pleadings\nanticipates defensive matters and pleads them, a defendant may rely upon the defenses though\nhis only pleading is a general denial.” Raney v. White, 267 S.W.2d 199, 200 (Tex.Civ.App.—San\nAntonio 1954, writ ref'd). Pleading an agreement illegal on its face in effect anticipates the defense.\nThe other principle is that the courts will not enforce a plainly illegal contract even if the parties do\nnot object. Lawson, 34 S.W. at 921. Enforcement of an illegal agreement violates public policy. Id.\n\n [8] For the same reasons, we hold that the defense of penalty is not waived by the failure\nto plead it if it is apparent on the face of the petition and established as a matter of law.\nEnforcement of a penalty, like enforcement of an illegal contract, violates *790 public policy.\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACT § 356; see State v. Alpha Oil & Gas, Inc., 747\nS.W.2d 378 (Tex.1988). It should not be done, even if the parties do not object. In this case Martha\npleaded that she was “entitled to damages ... in the amount of ten (10) times all losses suffered”.\nInasmuch as Martha's own pleading establishes that the contractual provision she relies upon is an\nunenforceable penalty under our decisions in Stewart and Campesi as a matter of law, Harry was\nnot required to plead penalty as an affirmative defense.\n\nContrary to the dissent's very exaggerated alarms, we do not hold that the affirmative defense of\npenalty need never be pleaded. Whenever the defense is not clearly established on the face of the\npleadings, as it is here, it must be pleaded. We do not “resurrect[ ] trial by ambush”, post, at 790,\nor “retreat from ... encouraging full disclosure during discovery”, post, at 792. We apply a narrow\nbut necessary exception, long and well established, to the general requirement that affirmative\ndefenses be pleaded. We do not hold that penalty “can be asserted as a defense for the first time\non appeal”, post, at 792, in violation of Rule 52(a), TEX.R.APP.P. The record in this case reflects\nthat the issue of penalty was raised in the trial court, and that the trial court refused to enforce the\npenalty provision of the partnership agreement.\n\n******\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (1991)\n\n\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that Martha is not entitled to recover ten times her actual damages.\nFinding no error in the judgment of the court of appeals, we affirm it.\n\n\nGONZALEZ, Justice, dissenting.\nDespite the clear language of TEX.R.CIV.P. 94 and the collective wisdom of every court of appeals\nof this state that has considered the issue, the majority holds that a defendant need not affirmatively\nplead the defense of “penalty” in a contract action. This holding resurrects trial by ambush and\nrejects the notion that parties are entitled to know what theories of law they will face at trial. I would\nhold that by failing to plead it, Mr. Phillips waived his right to assert that the contract he entered\ninto with his wife is unenforceable. Furthermore, since Mr. Phillips waived the penalty defense by\nfailing to affirmatively plead it, I would not reach the question of whether the contractual provision\nin question is, on its face, an unenforceable penalty. I thus would reverse the judgment of the\ncourt of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for entry of a judgment that enforces the\nprovision.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Phillips were married for 32 years prior to getting a divorce. With the assistance of\ncounsel, they entered into a pre-divorce agreement, whereby they transferred about $18 million\nof their assets into a partnership which Mr. Phillips would manage. Mr. Phillips in effect said to\nhis soon-to-be ex-wife: “Trust me.” As a disincentive to cheating or short changing Mrs. Phillips,\nMr. Phillips pledged that he would pay her 10 times the amount of the losses if he violated the\ncontract. 1 The agreement also recited that Mr. Phillips owed Mrs. Phillips a fiduciary duty, a\nhigher standard of care than normally exists between parties to a contract. 2\n\nEight years later, Mrs. Phillips sued Mr. Phillips, alleging that he violated the agreement. *791\nMr. Phillips entered a general denial and asserted the affirmative defenses of limitations, laches,\nand equitable estoppel. In a unanimous verdict, the jury found that Mr. Phillips breached the\nagreement by interfering with Mrs. Phillips right to examine the books and records of the\npartnership, and by willfully underpaying Mrs. Phillips and overpaying himself.\n\n\n\n                                          AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\nRule 94 enumerates specific affirmative defenses which are waived if not pleaded, such as accord\nand satisfaction, arbitration and award, fraud, illegality, statute of frauds, statute of limitations,\n“and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.” TEX.R.CIV.P. 94. An\naffirmative defense does not tend to rebut factual propositions asserted by a plaintiff, but seeks\nto establish an independent reason why the plaintiff should not recover. Gorman v. Life Ins. Co.\nof North America, 811 S.W.2d 542, 546 (Tex.1991). Asserting the defense of penalty does not\ndeny the facts pleaded by the plaintiff; instead, it is an independent reason why the contract should\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     6\n\fPhillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (1991)\n\n\n\nnot be enforced as written. In other words, if the defendant asserts facts that defeat in whole or in\npart the plaintiff's claim, such assertion amounts to an affirmative defense that must be pleaded\nor it is waived. “Penalty” is a classic affirmative defense; in my view, it clearly falls within the\npurview of Rule 94.\n\nThe majority implies that as long as the issue does not depend upon evidence or findings, no\npurpose is served by requiring that it be specifically pleaded. But there is a valid purpose to serve,\nnamely, the need for notice and fair play, so as to avoid trials by ambush.\n\nThe court refers to Lewkowicz v. El Paso Apparel Corp., 625 S.W.2d 301, 303 (Tex.1981), for\nits holding that pleading is not necessary if the affirmative defense appears on the face of the\nplaintiff's pleadings. That case is distinguishable because it involved the defense of illegality of\ncontract. The defense of illegality is a special situation and a poor choice from which to draw a rule\nof general applicability. The rule that a court will not enforce an illegal contract is for the public's\nbenefit rather than contending parties. Lewis v. Davis, 145 Tex. 468, 199 S.W.2d 146, 151 (1947).\nA strong policy reason supports the illegality exception. That is, courts should not have to validate\ncontracts that are illegal on their face merely because a defendant has failed to plead illegality.\n\nHere, the court seems to be saying that pleading and proof are not necessary, because the issue\nof whether the liquidated damages provision is a penalty is a question of law. In some contracts\nit may be possible to determine from their four corners that they impose a penalty. The classic\nexample is the lease that assesses the same liquidated damages for every breach, regardless of how\ntrivial. Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484, 486 (1952). But, in most cases, proof will\nbe necessary. Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. La Villa I.S.D., 779 S.W.2d 102, 106–107 (Tex.App.\n—Corpus Christi 1989, no writ); See D. WENDORF, ET AL., TEXAS RULES OF EVIDENCE\nMANUAL, I–38 (3rd ed. 1991).\n\nA good example of the need for proof is Presnal v. TLL Energy Corp., 788 S.W.2d 123, 127\n(Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.1990], writ denied). In that case, a mineral lease provided that the\nlessee was required to drill a second well or pay $75,000, which the defendant contended was a\npenalty. There is no way a court could possibly know if this provision is a reasonable forecast of\ndamages and therefore not a penalty, unless pleadings and proof develop the issue. It would be\npatently unfair not to require defendant to notify the plaintiff that the possible existence of penalty\nwould be an issue and this is contrary to well established case law.\n\nEvery intermediate appellate court considering this issue has held that penalty is an affirmative\ndefense under Rule 94 which is waived if not pleaded. Bethel v. Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d\n834, 838–839 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.); *792 Robinson v. Granite\nEquip.

Waite, 424 S.W.2d 691, 693\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Waco 1968, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\nThere is no compelling reason for this court now to reject by implication the well-grounded\npleading practice and disagree with the cases cited above that hold that as a rule penalty is an\naffirmative defense which must be pleaded or it is waived. In my view, this is a retreat from this\ncourt's recent trend towards encouraging full disclosure during discovery of all witnesses, facts and\nlegal theories upon which a party intends to rely at trial. This trend not only encourages litigants\nto be well prepared for trial, but also enables disputes to be resolved on their true merits and\nnot on “mere technicalities.” It makes no sense to me to subject parties to a severe sanction for\nfailing to disclose witnesses or to supplement discovery responses, but not require them to plead\nthe legal theory upon which they intend to rely to defeat their opponent's claim. The majority has\ncreated an exception to Rule 94 that has a visceral appeal, but collapses on its own logic. The court\nsays that the contractual provision in issue is a penalty as a matter of law, and thus need not be\npleaded (and can be asserted as a defense for the first time on appeal). But a defendant likewise\nmay defeat a contract claim under a statute of limitations defense. And while the defendant may\nbe entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, we nevertheless require affirmative pleading of the\nstatute of limitations defense. The court ultimately rationalizes its de facto modification of Rule\n94 by relying on the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356 to assert that public\npolicy demands the result. The court expands the public policy exception to Rule 94's pleading\nrequirement beyond the exception for illegal contracts to include contracts that allegedly impose\na penalty. This is a faulty rationale. First, this is not a case where pure contract principles apply.\nMr. Phillips agreed to a higher standard of care (namely, a fiduciary's standard) than he normally\nwould have owed Mrs. Phillips in a standard contractual relationship. Courts impose damages on\nparties who violate a fiduciary duty in order to punish the party's breach of trust. I agree with the\nRestatement § 356's directive that the “central objective behind the system of contract remedies is\ncompensatory, not punitive.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356 comment a\n(1979). But Mr. Phillips entered into this agreement with his eyes open, accepting a higher than\nnormal standard of care and devising and adopting a measure of damages for his breach of that\nstandard. I do not see how the it advances the best interest of the public to bail him out of his\nbargain. I would hold that penalty is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded and that Mr.\nPhillips waived this defense by failing to plead it. For the above reasons, I dissent.\n\n\n\nMAUZY and DOGGETT, JJ., join this opinion.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (1991)\n\n\n\n1      The jury also found that Harry breached the partnership agreement by failing to calculate the amount of distributions required to be\n       paid the partners and by failing to make all the distributions required by the agreement, but that Martha ratified Harry's actions in\n       making distributions other than as called for by the agreement.\n2      Harry contends that the court of appeals should not have disturbed the trial court's damage award. As a rule, however, the judgment in\n       a case tried by a jury must conform to the verdict. See TEX.R.CIV.P. 301. The trial court properly did not ask the jury to include in its\n       determination of Martha's actual damages a reasonable fee for legal services necessary to her prosecution of the case. See Hammonds\n       v. Hammonds, 158 Tex. 516, 313 S.W.2d 603, 605 (1958). We must assume that the jury followed the trial court's instructions and\n       answered the question put to them. See Turner, Collie & Braden v. Brookhollow, Inc., 642 S.W.2d 160, 167 (Tex.1982). Given that\n       assumption, we must conclude that the jury's answer of $300,000 to the trial court's question did not include attorney fees.\n          Harry argues that, logically, the jury must have arrived at their $300,000 finding by adding $37,585 accounting fees which Martha\n          testified she incurred to the stipulated $250,000 in attorney fees. However plausible Harry's explanation of the jury's reasoning\n          process may be, it cannot substitute for the jury's finding. What the jury found, not why the jury found it, is the relevant inquiry\n          absent jury misconduct. First Nat'l Bank v. Zimmerman, 442 S.W.2d 674, 678 (Tex.1969).\n          Under Rule 301, the trial court could properly have rendered judgment awarding Martha less than the $300,000 found by the jury\n          as actual damages only if the finding had no support in the evidence. See Burt v. Lochausen, 151 Tex. 289, 249 S.W.2d 194, 199\n          (1952). See also 4 R. MCDONALD, TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE IN DISTRICT AND COUNTY COURTS § 17.32 nn. 7–8 (rev.\n          1984). Harry does not argue here that there is no evidence to support the jury's finding. Thus, we conclude that the court of appeals\n          was correct in rendering judgment against Harry for the actual damages found by the jury plus stipulated attorney fees.\n          Harry also complains of the court of appeals' judgment that he, rather than the partnership, pay Martha's attorney fees. This point,\n          however, was not raised in Harry's motion for rehearing in the court of appeals and is therefore not preserved. See TEX.R.APP.P.\n          131(e); Oil Field Haulers Ass'n v. Railroad Commission, 381 S.W.2d 183, 189 (Tex.1964).\n3      “Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the\n       anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise\n       obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.”\n1      At trial, Mr. Phillips testified as follows:\n             Q There's another interesting provision in [the partnership agreement] that says if Mrs. Phillips can show that you have breached\n             your fiduciary duty to her that you will be obliged to pay her 10 times any amount that she proves. Are you familiar with that?\n             A Yes sir.\n             Q How in the world did that get in there?\n             A I wanted her to let me-wanted to prove to her that I would not do anything wrong.\n             Q So—\n             A So I put it in myself.\n             Q Was it your idea?\n             A Yes, sir.\n2      The partnership agreement provides:\n          16.1 Fiduciary Capacity. “The general partner shall act in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the limited partner.”\n          16.2 Damages. “If the general partner breaches his trust hereunder, he shall pay to the limited partner as liquidated damages ten\n          times the amount she loses as a result of such breach. Errors of judgment shall not be considered breaches of trusts”.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(Appellant)\nentered into an earnest money contract for the purchase of two lots at 1900 Gus Moran in El Paso.\nThe Lermas tendered a check to Moore for $13,500 as part of the earnest money contract. The\nsale of the lots was contingent upon the Lermas using Moore as a builder. On April 16, 1990,\nthen Lermas and Moore incorporated the previous contract into a new home residential earnest\nmoney contract. This contract provided for the construction of a custom home on the lots for a\ntotal price, including the lots, of $180,000. The new contract called for an additional payment\nof $6,500 earnest money, due upon the Lermas' approval of the house plan. Paragraph 4 of the\ncontract required the following:\n\n            FINANCING CONDITIONS: This contract is subject to approval for Buyer of\n            a conventional (type of loan) loan (the Loan) to be evidenced by a promissory\n            note (the Note) in the amount of $ 80,000,.... Buyer shall apply for the Loan\n            within 15 days from the effective date of this contract and shall make every\n            reasonable effort to obtain approval from Competitive Mortgage Co., as lender,\n            or any lender that will make the Loan.... If the Loan cannot be approved within\n            60 days from the effective date of this contract, this contract shall terminate\n            and the Earnest Money shall be refunded to Buyer without delay. [Emphasis\n            added.]\n\nIn addition to the standard provision of the preprinted contract, special handwritten provisions\nwere included under Paragraph 11:\n\n  1) Seller give One Year (1) Builders Warranty and 10–Year H.O.W. warranty\n\n  2) On Lot held more than 60 days, Earnest Money is non-refundable.\n\n  3) Lot purchase contract dated January 30, 1990 is hereby transferred to this Home construction\n  contract.\n\n  4) * Balance of Down Payment to be made at time of sale of properties located at 1400 Bodega\n  and 3509 Breckenridge. [Emphasis added.]\n\nConstruction on the house began in December 1990, and was completed in the summer of 1991.\nThe Lermas were ultimately denied credit and were unable to close on the house. In September\n1991, after demanding the return of their earnest money, they initiated this suit in November 1992.\nAfter trial to a jury, the Lermas were awarded $20,000 in damages. The jury found that Moore\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 2\n\fR. Conrad Moore & Associates, Inc. v. Lerma, 946 S.W.2d 90 (1997)\n\n\n\nbreached the contract by failing to return the Lermas' earnest money upon the Lermas' failure to\nget loan approval within the 60 days contemplated by Paragraph 4 of the contract. Moore appeals.\n\n\n\n              STANDARD OF REVIEW: LEGAL AND FACTUAL SUFFICIENCY\n\nMoore asserts in its first six points of error that the evidence was legally or factual insufficient\nto support the jury's findings.\n\nIn reviewing a “no evidence” or legal sufficiency claim, we examine only the evidence favorable to\nthe verdict and disregard all evidence to the contrary. T.O. Stanley Boot Company, Inc. v. Bank of\nEl Paso, 847 S.W.2d 218, 221 (Tex.1992); Furr's, Inc. v. Logan, 893 S.W.2d 187, 190 (Tex.App.\n—El Paso 1995, no writ). We may reverse on a no evidence point only if the record reflects no\nevidence necessary to support a vital fact, *93 or if the evidence raises only a suspicion of the\nfact's existence. Cecil v. Smith, 804 S.W.2d 509, 510 n. 2 (Tex.1991); Furr's, Inc., 893 S.W.2d at\n190. In reviewing a factual sufficiency or great weight and preponderance claim, we examine all\nevidence presented at trial, and may reverse only if the challenged finding is so against the great\nweight and preponderance of the evidence so as to be manifestly unjust. In re King's Estate, 150\nTex. 662, 244 S.W.2d 660 (1951); Furr's, Inc., 893 S.W.2d at 190. We may not substitute our\nown conclusions for those of the jury, and we may not resolve conflicts in the evidence or pass\nupon the credibility of the witnesses. Benoit v. Wilson, 150 Tex. 273, 239 S.W.2d 792 (1951);\nFurr's, Inc., 893 S.W.2d at 190. Where the evidence is conflicting, the jury's verdict is generally\nconclusive on the matter. Id.\n\nIn reviewing a “matter of law” challenge, we first examine the record to see if any evidence\nsupports the finding, ignoring all evidence to the contrary. If no evidence supports the finding, we\nthen determine whether the evidence conclusively establishes its converse. If so, we must reverse.\nSterner v. Marathon Oil Co., 767 S.W.2d 686, 690 (Tex.1989); Furr's, Inc., 893 S.W.2d at 190.\n\n\n\n                                                Loan Approval\n\n [1] In its first point of error, Moore asserts the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\nsupport the jury finding that the Lermas failed to get loan approval for the purchase of the home.\nAfter a diligent search of the record, we have been unable to find any evidence that would support\na finding that the Lermas did get financing for the purchase. Moore testified that “someone”\nat Sun World Savings informed her that the Lermas were approved within the 60 day period.\nHowever, Ms. Nancy Montes of Mortgage Plus, who took the Lermas' loan application, testified\nthat they were never approved. She stated that a “take out” letter sent out in October 1990 was\nnot final loan approval but a prequalification report that indicates a conditional approval subject\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Ms. Montes further testified that she exhausted all her\nsources in attempting to get financing for the Lermas. Ultimately, the Lermas were denied credit\nand were unable to close on the house. The record overwhelmingly supports the jury's finding that\nthe Lermas did not get loan approval for the purchase of the house. Therefore, Moore's first point\nof error is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                                     Waiver\n\nIn its second point of error, Moore asserts that the evidence establishes as a matter of law that the\nLermas waived any right to have the earnest money refunded. We agree.\n\n [2] [3] [4] [5] Any contractual right can be waived. Purvis Oil Corp. v. Hillin, 890 S.W.2d\n931, 937 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1994, no writ). A waiver is an intentional release, relinquishment,\nor surrender of a known right. Id. The following elements must be met to find waiver: (1) a right\nmust exist at the time of the waiver; (2) the party who is accused of waiver must have constructive\nor actual knowledge of the right in question; and (3) the party intended to relinquish its right. See\nRiley v. Meriwether, 780 S.W.2d 919, 922 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1989, writ denied). Intentional\nrelinquishment of a known right can be inferred from intentional conduct which is inconsistent\nwith claiming the contractual right. Id.\n\n [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] It has been conclusively established that the Lermas did not obtain\nfinancing for the purchase of the house from Moore. Paragraph 4 of the contract clearly states that\nif the purchasers are unable to obtain financing within 60 days of the effective date of the contract,\nthey had a right to have their money returned. Thus, on June 15, 1990, the Lermas had a right to\nthe return of their earnest money. The Lermas' intention to relinquish their right to the return of the\nearnest money, however, is clearly established by their conduct after June 15. Between the date\nthe contract was signed and the date construction began on the house, the Lermas participated in\nthe design of the house, approved the blueprints in July 1990, and tendered an additional $6,500\nin earnest money to Moore in October. The Lermas were then conditionally approved for *94\nfinancing which allowed Moore to get a construction loan to begin building the house.\n\nAdditionally, after construction of the house began in December 1990, the Lermas monitored its\nprogress on a daily basis. In March 1991, they requested and paid for an upgrade in tile for the\nhouse. In June, Isabel Lerma executed a promissory note in the principal amount of $6,000 to\nMoore to pay for the addition of another room to the house. During this same time period, the\nLermas sold their home and another property, as agreed in the contract, to fund the down payment.\nMr. Lerma testified that he fully intended to buy the house that Moore was building, and at no\ntime prior to August 1991 did he consider the contract terminated. Mrs. Lerma also testified that\nuntil August 1991, they wanted and intended to purchase the home.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Lerma, 946 S.W.2d 90 (1997)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Lermas claim that they were unaware that they could get their money back on that\ndate, both Mr. and Mrs. Lerma signed the contract. Mrs. Lerma testified that she read the contract.\nMr. Lerma was not sure if he read the contract, but testified that no one prevented him from doing\nso. A person who signs a contract is presumed to know and understand its contents; absent a\nfinding of fraud, failure to apprehend the rights and obligations under the contract will not excuse\nperformance. See G–W–L, Inc. v. Robichaux, 643 S.W.2d 392 (Tex.1982); Thigpen v. Locke, 363\nS.W.2d 247 (Tex.1962). There is no evidence of fraud, actual or constructive, on the part of Moore.\nThus, we conclude the Lermas had knowledge of their right to a refund of the earnest money on\nJune 15.\n\nThere is no evidence to support the jury's finding that the Lermas did not waive the right to have\nthe earnest money refunded. The Lermas' intentional conduct after the right to the return of the\nearnest money arose was inconsistent with claiming that right. They intentionally relinquished a\nknown right, and therefore, we find as a matter of law, that the Lermas waived Paragraph 4 of the\ncontract, and the contract continued in effect, including Paragraph 11 allowing Moore to retain\nthe earnest money on the lots.\n\nThe Lermas argue that Paragraph 4 operates as a condition precedent. When the Lermas failed\nto obtain financing within 60 days, the contract, including any forfeiture provisions, terminated.\nThus, the Lermas assert Paragraphs 16 and 11 never became effective. Many Texas cases have\nconstrued provisions similar to Paragraph 4 as conditions precedent. See e.g., Knox v. Townes,\n470 S.W.2d 290, 291 (Tex.Civ.App.—Waco 1971, no writ)(clause stating contract is contingent\non obtaining financing creates a condition precedent that must be met before buyer is obligated\nto perform contract); Watkins v. Williamson, 869 S.W.2d 383, 384 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1993, no\nwrit)(residential earnest money contract contingent on satisfactory financing contains a condition\nprecedent; the contract depends upon the condition being met); Berman v. M.O. Rife, III, 644\nS.W.2d 574, 575–76 (Tex.App.—Fort Worth 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (contract “subject to approval”\nof a conventional loan is condition precedent inserted for benefit of buyer to avoid forfeiture or\npenalty). We agree with the Lermas that Paragraph 16, a simple default clause included in the\npreprinted sections of the contract, may not have become effective in the event the Lermas failed to\nobtain financing within 60 days. In this case, however, we have an additional handwritten provision\nthat is somewhat out of the ordinary and distinguishable from the clauses considered in the cases\nfinding conditions precedent. Under Paragraph 11, the “special provisions” section of the contract,\nthe parties added the phrase “on Lot held more than 60 days, Earnest Money is non-refundable.”\nThis brief passage is less than a model of clarity. At first blush, it appears in direct contradiction\nto Paragraph 4, the termination clause.\n\nIf a contract is worded so that it can be given a certain or definite legal meaning or interpretation,\nthen it is not ambiguous and the court will construe the contract as a matter of law. City of\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    5\n\fR. Conrad Moore & Associates, Inc. v. Lerma, 946 S.W.2d 90 (1997)\n\n\n\nPinehurst v. Spooner Addition Water Co., 432 S.W.2d 515, 518 (Tex.1968); First City Nat'l Bank\nof Midland v. Concord Oil Co., 808 S.W.2d 133, 137 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1991, no writ). There\nis no allegation in this case that the earnest *95 money contract is ambiguous, and it does not\nappear to us to be so. Generally, the parties to a contract intend every clause to have some effect\nand the Court may not ignore any portion of the contract unless there is an irreconcilable conflict.\nOgden v. Dickinson State Bank, 662 S.W.2d 330, 332 (Tex.1983); Woods v. Sims, 154 Tex. 59, 273\nS.W.2d 617 (1954). In the interpretation of contracts, the primary concern of courts is to ascertain\nand to give effect to the intentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument. Coker v. Coker,\n650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983); Duracon, Inc. v. Price, 817 S.W.2d 147, 149 (Tex.App.—El\nPaso 1991, writ denied). This requires the court to examine and consider the entire instrument and\nreach a decision so that none of the provisions will be rendered meaningless. Id.\n\nBy its wording, Paragraph 11 is not merely a forfeiture clause subject to the condition precedent\nstated in Paragraph 4. Paragraph 11 envisions the non-occurrence of the condition (in this case\nfinancing obtained within 60 days), references the 60–day provision, and provides for continuation\nof the contract beyond 60 days. To give effect to both provisions and render neither meaningless,\nwe must construe the handwritten provision to allow the buyer, at its option, to continue the\ncontract after 60 days in the absence of financing. A condition precedent like any other provision\nof a contract can be waived. Purvis Oil Corp., 890 S.W.2d at 931. Thus, if financing were not\nobtained in 60 days, the Lermas could do nothing, the contract would terminate, and the Lermas\nwould be entitled to return of the earnest money. On the other hand, the Lermas could take action to\nhave the lot “held more than 60 days” thereby waiving the right to the return of the earnest money.\n\nThe record establishes that the Lermas chose the latter option. They worked with Moore on the\ndesign of the house, tendered additional earnest money four months after the contract would have\nexpired under Paragraph 4, contracted with Moore to increase the square footage of the house, paid\nfor tile upgrades, and sold both the home they were living in and another property in anticipation\nof closing on the house when it was completed. The record therefore conclusively establishes that\nthe Lermas waived termination of the contract and instead continued to operate pursuant to the\ncontract under Paragraph 11.\n\n [12] [13] The Lermas further assert that even if we find waiver of Paragraph 4, Paragraph 11\nis unenforceable as a penalty. The Lermas characterize Paragraph 11 as an attempted liquidated\ndamages clause. Under Texas law, a liquidated damages provision will be enforced only if the court\nfinds (1) the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) the amount\nof liquidated damages is a reasonable forecast of just compensation. Rio Grande Valley Sugar\nGrowers, Inc., v. Campesi, 592 S.W.2d 340, 342 n. 2 (Tex.1979); Baker v. Int'l Record Syndicate,\nInc., 812 S.W.2d 53, 55 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1991, no writ)(opinion on rehearing). The Lermas\nargue that Moore failed to establish these elements. The party asserting that a liquidated damages\nclause is unenforceable as a penalty, however, bears the burden of proof. Id. The Lermas failed to\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  6\n\fR. Conrad Moore & Associates, Inc. v. Lerma, 946 S.W.2d 90 (1997)\n\n\n\nplead penalty. Although they requested a trial amendment, the trial court denied the amendment\nand the Lermas do not attack that ruling on appeal. Further, the Lermas did not request, or object\nto the absence of, a jury question or instruction on the elements of penalty.\n\n [14] The Lermas suggest that a jury question was unnecessary because whether a contractual\nprovision is an enforceable liquidated damages provision or an unenforceable penalty is a question\nof law for the court. They argue that the trial court in this case implicitly found Paragraph 11\nan unenforceable penalty as a matter of law when it entered judgment in favor of the Lermas.\nWhile the determination between an unenforceable penalty and an enforceable liquidated damages\nprovision is generally a question of law for the court, sometimes the factual underpinnings of\nthe elements must be resolved before the legal question can be decided. Phillips v. Phillips, 820\nS.W.2d 785, 788 (Tex.1991). This is such a case. The amount the Lermas paid in earnest money\nis not, on its face, necessarily disproportionate to actual damages Moore allegedly suffered as the\nresult of the Lermas' failure *96 to purchase the custom built home. Thus, at least the fact of\nMoore's actual damages should have been determined by a jury before the trial court could consider\nwhether the liquidated damages were a reasonable forecast of just compensation. See Phillips, 820\nS.W.2d at 788–89. Even if fact issues did not exist in this particular context, we do not find that\nthe trial court's entry of judgment implicates the penalty issue in any way. The trial court entered\njudgment on jury findings that the Lermas did not obtain financing by the deadline provided in\nParagraph 4, and that the Lermas did not waive their right to return of the earnest money. An\ninterpretation of Paragraph 11 is unnecessary to those particular jury findings. Moreover, we are\nhard pressed to find that the trial court “implicitly” found Paragraph 11 unenforceable as a penalty\nwhen it had refused to allow the Lermas to plead penalty by trial amendment.\n\nWe must reject the Lermas' arguments and affirm Moore's second point of error.\n\n\n\n                                          Moore's Attorney's Fees\n\n [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] In its eleventh and twelfth points, Moore alleges error in the trial\ncourt's failure to allow evidence of, and award, Moore's attorney's fees. Moore argues that the\nearnest money contract provided for attorney's fees to the prevailing party in the event of litigation.\nWe find, however, that Moore failed to plead for attorney's fees. A judgment must be supported\nby the pleadings and, if not so supported, it is void. State v. Estate of Brown, 802 S.W.2d 898,\n900 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1991, no writ). A party may not be granted relief in the absence of\npleadings to support that relief. Stoner v. Thompson, 578 S.W.2d 679, 682, 683–84 (Tex.1979);\nEstate of Brown, 802 S.W.2d at 900. A judgment, absent issues tried by consent, must conform\nto the pleadings. Estate of Brown, 802 S.W.2d at 900. Absent a mandatory statute, a trial court's\njurisdiction to render a judgment for attorney's fees must be invoked by pleadings, and a judgment\nnot supported by pleadings requesting an award of attorney's fees is a nullity. Id. In this case, there\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 7\n\fR. Conrad Moore & Associates, Inc. v. Lerma, 946 S.W.2d 90 (1997)\n\n\n\nis no pleading to support an award of attorney's fees. Accordingly, we overrule Moore's eleventh\nand twelfth points of error.\n\n\n\n                    The Court Need Not Reach the Remainder of Moore's Points\n\nIn its third through tenth points, Moore challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the\njury's damages and unjust enrichment findings, the trial court's failure to disregard jury findings,\nand the trial court's calculation of prejudgment interest. Our disposition of Moore's second point\nof error, and of the Lermas' second cross-point, renders it unnecessary for us to reach Moore's\nPoints of Error Three through Ten. Accordingly, we do not reach those points.\n\n\n\n                                         The Lermas' Cross–Points\n\nThe Lermas raise three cross-points.\n\n\nThe Lermas' Attorney's Fees\nIn their first cross-point, the Lermas assert error in the trial court's failure to award them their\nattorney's fees. Section 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides for\nrecovery of attorney's fees in addition to the amount of a valid claim for an oral or written contract.\nTEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 38.001 (Vernon 1986). The contract in this case entitled\nthe prevailing party in any legal proceeding to attorney's fees from the non-prevailing party. We\nhave found, however, that the Lermas should not prevail on their causes of action. Accordingly,\nwe overrule the Lermas' first cross-point.\n\n\nRecovery Under Unjust Enrichment\n [20] [21] [22] In their second cross-point, the Lermas argue that even if we find they cannot\nprevail on their contract cause of action, they can recover under an unjust enrichment theory. In\naddition to the contract claim, the jury also found in favor of the Lermas on their unjust enrichment\ncause of action. The unjust enrichment doctrine applies the principles of restitution to disputes\nwhich for one reason or another are not governed by a contract between the contending parties.\nBurlington Northern R. Co. v. Southwestern Elec. Power Co., 925 S.W.2d 92, 96–97 (Tex.App.—\nTexarkana 1996, no writ).

The conversion of services\nwas more problematic than anticipated, causing Southern Union to cease operations and sue CSG\nfor breach of contract. Following trial, the jury found in favor of CSG. Accordingly, the trial court\nentered a final judgment awarding damages to CSG. Southern Union appeals only the amount of\ndamages awarded and does not challenge liability. Because there is legally sufficient evidence in\nthe record to support the judgment, we affirm the award except as modified.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\n\n\n\n                                              BACKGROUND\n\nBeginning in the late 1990's, Southern Union experienced technological difficulties and realized\nthat its computer system was no longer capable of printing and mailing approximately one million\nbills per month to its customers. 1 Southern Union investigated companies to which it could\noutsource these operations and then requested proposals from several potential vendors. CSG\nresponded to Southern Union's request in February 2000. Southern Union selected CSG's bid from\nthe field of candidates, and the two companies engaged in formal negotiations from April until\nSeptember.\n\nA contract was finalized and signed by representatives from both Southern Union and CSG as of\nOctober 13, 2000. The contract contained a “discontinuance fee” provision, obligating Southern\nUnion to pay a specified amount of damages to CSG in the event that Southern Union terminated\nthe agreement before its five-year term expired. The parties agree that the provision was intended\nas a liquidated damages provision.\n\nAfter the contract was finalized, CSG provided Southern Union with a written project plan\ncontemplating December 1, 2000 as the date for CSG to “go live” with the print-and-mail\noperations. In the months leading up to that deadline, implementation problems arose on both sides\nand the conversion fell behind schedule. The companies continued discussions in an attempt to\nsolve the problems until the first week of January 2001, when Southern Union ceased work on the\nproject. Southern Union filed suit against CSG on February 7, asserting breach of contract among\nother causes of action.\n\nIn its verdict, the jury found that Southern Union and CSG were both in breach of the agreement,\nbut that CSG's breach was excused, and that CSG would be fairly and reasonably compensated by\nan award of $2.1 million for the discontinuance fee; $111,000 for the cost of paper and envelopes\npurchased by CSG; $1,045,944 for CSG's lost profits; and $140,000 for the cost of software\nlicenses provided by CSG to Southern Union. Beneath the last element of damages, the jury wrote\n“upon return of 300 licenses to CSG, the answer would be $0.”The trial court determined that, as a\nmatter of law, it was proper to award liquidated damages in lieu of actual damages, and therefore\nentered a final judgment in conformance with the jury's verdict, for a total amount of $2,351,000,\nplus interest and attorney's fees.\n\n\n\n                                                 ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\n *2 On appeal, Southern Union challenges the award of damages to CSG Systems, claiming that\nCSG should not be awarded any liquidated damages pursuant to the discontinuance fee provision,\nbut rather that CSG's recovery should be confined to $1,045,944 in lost profits. Southern Union\nfirst asserts that, based on the timing of its breach, the proper calculation of the fee results in a zero\nsum. Alternatively, Southern Union asserts that even if the proper calculation is $2.1 million, CSG\nis not entitled to recover the award because that amount constitutes an illegal penalty. Southern\nUnion also claims that prejudgment interest should not be awarded on CSG's damages for the\ndiscontinuance fee or lost profits. Finally, Southern Union urges that it is entitled to a remittitur\nof $140,000 because it returned the software licenses to CSG.\n\n\nThe Discontinuance Fee Provision\nSouthern Union's first issue, asserting that the timing of Southern Union's breach results in zero\ndamages for the discontinuance fee, turns on a construction of the provision's terms. We agree\nwith the parties that the provision is unambiguous. We therefore review this issue as a matter of\nlaw, looking only to the contract's four corners and interpreting its plain meaning. See French\nv. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 896 S.W.2d 795, 796-97 (Tex.1995). The discontinuance fee provision\nstates:\n\n           The parties have mutually agreed upon the fees for the Services to be provided\n           hereunder based upon certain assumed volumes of processing activity, and the\n           length of the term of Agreement. Customer 2 acknowledges and agrees that,\n           without the certainty of revenue promised by the commitments set forth in this\n           Agreement, CSG would have been unwilling to provide the Services at the\n           fees set forth in the Agreement. Because of the difficulty in ascertaining CSG's\n           actual damages for a termination or other breach of the Agreement by Customer\n           resulting in a termination of this Agreement before the expiration of the then-\n           current term, Customer agrees that prior to such termination and in addition to\n           all other amounts then due and owing to CSG, Customer will pay to CSG (as\n           a contract and not as a penalty) an amount equal to a percentage of the total\n           Subscriber Statement Minimum for the remaining term of the Agreement, as\n           defined in Schedule C, times the then current ESP Processing Fees for the First\n           Physical Page, as defined in Schedule C beginning with the calendar month\n           in which termination occurs (“Discontinuance Fee”). If any such termination\n           occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date of this Agreement,\n           the percentage shall be fifty percent (50%). If between the first and second\n           anniversary of the Effective Date it shall be thirty percent (30%) and if following\n           the second anniversary of the Effective Date it shall be ten percent (10%).\n           Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Discontinuance Fee is a reasonable\n           estimation of the actual damages which CSG would suffer if CSG were to fail\n           to receive the amount of processing business contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\n           Customer shall not be required to pay the Discontinuance Fee if CSG terminates\n           this Agreement other than as a result of Customer's breach of its obligations\n           hereunder or if Customer terminates the Agreement for a material, uncured\n           breach by CSG. The Discontinuance Fee shall be CSG's sole remedy resulting\n           from a termination or other breach of this Agreement by Customer resulting\n           in a termination of this Agreement before the expiration of the then-current\n           term. In the event of a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of Southern\n           Union Company's assets to a third party, the percentages used to calculate the\n           Discontinuance Fee shall be twenty-five percent (25%), fifteen percent (15%)\n           and five percent (5%), respectively.\n\n*3 (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe parties agree that, given the plain meaning of the relevant language, the proper way to calculate\nthe discontinuance fee for a breach within the first year of signing the agreement is to multiply the\napplicable “Subscriber Statement Minimum” by the applicable “ESP Processing Fees” and then\ntake fifty percent of that total. The parties disagree, however, on how to determine one factor of this\nequation: the Subscriber Statement Minimum. Southern Union asserts that, pursuant to Schedule\nC, the minimum does not accrue until after the “commencement date.” 3 Because Southern Union\nbreached this agreement prior to the commencement date, 4 it claims that the minimum was zero,\nand that the total calculation should therefore be zero.\n\nCSG interprets the provision to mean that, although Schedule C prevents Southern Union from\nhaving to pay the monthly minimum until after the commencement date, that time restriction\ndoes not apply to Southern Union's liability under the discontinuance fee provision. CSG asserts\nthat Southern Union's interpretation is wrong because it allows Southern Union to breach the\ncontract without consequence, so long as it does so within ninety days of the commencement date,\nregardless of the significant time and money invested by CSG during the implementation phase.\nAccording to CSG, the liquidated damages provision is most necessary during this initial time\nperiod because of the parties' unequal contributions and because of the difficulty in calculating\npotential damages before any actual profits have been made.\n\nWe agree with CSG's reading of the contract. Nothing in the provision limits its applicability to a\nbreach occurring after the commencement of services. The provision specifies the circumstances\nin which Southern Union is excused from paying the discontinuance fee, and none impose such\na timing limitation. To the contrary, the provision's express terms state that Southern Union shall\nbe liable for the discontinuance fee, at a rate of fifty percent, should it cause “any termination”\nwithin one year of signing the contract.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\nTestimony of witnesses from both Southern Union and CSG also supports CSG's assertion that the\nprovision was intended to apply during the implementation phase, to protect the significant up-\nfront contributions made by CSG before it had received any profits from the agreement. Pamela\nVanlandingham, CSG's Senior Vice President and General Manager of the statement processing\ncenter, testified that during November and December, the CSG team “worked around the clock” to\ncomplete the project, which included working “very hard over the holidays,” and that “CSG [had]\nexpended right at 500 to 600 hours” when Southern Union breached the contract. Southern Union\nofficials confirmed that the nature of this contract required front-loaded efforts by CSG and that,\nprior to terminating the agreement, they were aware of the money CSG invested on supplies and\nequipment, and of the hours CSG put toward programming, testing, and implementing the new\nsystem. David Kvapil, the Chief Financial Officer for Southern Union, testified that he knew CSG\nhad worked “well beyond the number of hours they were going to dedicate to the project,” that CSG\nhad provided a “significant batch of bills” to Southern Union for approval, and that CSG had spent\nover $100,000 on envelopes and paper by the end of December 2000. Christine Shores, a business\nanalyst for Southern Union's mail services division, testified that Southern Union approved the\norder for paper and envelopes prior to CSG placing it, and that Southern Union was aware of the\ntime and money spent by CSG in its efforts to commence live operations.\n\n *4 Based on the plain meaning of the provision, as supported by the witnesses' testimony,\nSouthern Union's liability for the discontinuance fee is not limited to a breach occurring after\nthe commencement of live operations. Southern Union is liable under the discontinuance fee for\nits breach of the agreement during the implementation phase. The amount of fair and reasonable\ndamages pursuant to the discontinuance fee was therefore properly calculated by the jury, and\naffirmed by the trial court, as $2.1 million. Southern Union's first issue is overruled.\n\n\nLiquidated Damages\nSouthern Union claims in its second issue that, if the discontinuance fee is properly calculated\nas $2.1 million, then CSG is not entitled to any recovery of that amount because it constitutes\nan improper penalty. For the purposes of this case, the parties agree that the discontinuance fee\nshould be treated as an award of liquidated damages.\n\nA liquidated damages provision may only be enforced when the court finds “(1) that the harm\ncaused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation and (2) that the amount of liquidated\ndamages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.”Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d\n785, 788 (Tex.1991). The party challenging the award of liquidated damages has the burden to\nestablish that the two-prong test is not satisfied and that, instead, the award of liquidated damages\nis an unenforceable penalty. See Dominzo v. Progressive County Mut. Ins. Co., 54 S.W.3d 867, 875\n(Tex.App.-Austin 2001, pet. denied). Whether the liquidated damages provision is enforceable is\na question of law.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\n\n\nDifficulty of Estimation\nSouthern Union seeks to satisfy the first part of its burden by claiming that CSG's damages were\neasy to estimate. Southern Union bases this claim on a “price projection” document prepared\nby CSG before entering the agreement, which anticipated that CSG would earn a total profit\nof $1,045,944 over the five-year term of its contract with Southern Union. Because the jury\nultimately awarded this exact amount to CSG as lost profits, Southern Union argues that CSG was\ncapable of precisely estimating its damages, and therefore the liquidated damages provision is an\nunenforceable penalty from which CSG is not entitled to recover. The record, however, shows\notherwise.\n\nThe language of the discontinuance fee provision supports the trial court's determination that an\naward of liquidated damages was proper because CSG's actual damages were not easy to estimate.\nThe provision expressly states that it was included in the contract “[b]ecause of the difficulty in\nascertaining CSG's actual damages for a termination or other breach of the Agreement,” and that\n“CSG would have been unwilling to provide the Services at the fees set forth in the Agreement” had\nSouthern Union not promised “certainty of revenue” by obligating itself to pay the discontinuance\nfee in the event that it breached the contract. This provision was a bargained-for exchange,\nnegotiated and approved by both companies.\n\n *5 When a provision is mutually bargained for by equally competent parties, we give deference\nto its enforcement. See Shel-al Corp. v. American Nat'l Ins. Co., 492 F.2d 87, 94 (5th Cir.1974).\nStanley Mayer, Southern Union's Chief Information Officer, testified that the provision's terms\nwere negotiated between attorneys representing both companies. From the face of the contract,\nSouthern Union understood at the time it entered the agreement that CSG's damages would be\ndifficult to estimate and therefore agreed a liquidated damages provision was necessary.\n\n“[T]he fundamental purpose of a valid liquidated damages provision is to provide a reasonable\nmeasure of compensation in the event of a breach where, at the time the provision is agreed\nto the damages are indeterminable or will be otherwise difficult to prove.”24 Williston on\nContracts § 65:3, at 250 (4th ed.2002). It is well established that lost profits can be inherently\ndifficult to estimate. See Texas Inst., Inc. v. Teletron Energy Mgmt., Inc., 877 S.W.2d 276,\n279 (Tex.1994). Frequently, lost profits are too speculative to recover because their calculation\ndepends on “uncertain and changing conditions, such as market fluctuations,” and this uncertainty\nis heightened where no profits have been made at the time the contract is breached. Id. The contract\nreflects that Southern Union and CSG sought to avoid such speculation in agreeing to the liquidated\ndamages provision. The sliding scale of damages recognized the front-loaded value to be provided\nby CSG. As argued by CSG, had there not been a discontinuance fee to rely on, in the event of\na breach by Southern Union-particularly early in the contract term-then CSG would have risked\nbeing unable to recover because of the uncertainty in calculating its lost profits.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\nThat CSG prepared a projection of its prices, and that the jury looked to the projection as a\nreasonable calculation for lost profits, does not satisfy Southern Union's burden. The purpose of\nthe document was not to define CSG's potential damages. Rather, as Vanlandingham testified,\nthe projection was an internal tool used by CSG to outline the prices it anticipated charging for\nits print-and-mail services, so that CSG could make an informed bid in response to Southern\nUnion's request for proposal. Vanlandingham also testified that the projection was prepared with a\n“conservative accounting approach to pricing.” CSG excluded several items from its calculations\nbecause, prior to entering the contract, the parties had not assigned a value to these items. This\nincreased the difficulty of estimating damages. CSG's expert confirmed the difficulty of this\nestimation by explaining several different ways that CSG's lost profits could be calculated, with the\nresults ranging between approximately $1 million to $4 million. After hearing this evidence, the\njury determined that $1,045,944 was a reasonable award of lost profits. But their verdict does not\nestablish that the estimation was either an easy or precise one to make. Given the mutually agreed-\nupon terms of the provision, and the evidence in support of its plain meaning, we are unpersuaded\nby Southern Union's assertion that CSG's damages were easy to estimate.\n\n\nReasonable Forecast of Just Compensation\n *6 Southern Union seeks to satisfy the second part of its burden by showing that the\ndiscontinuance fee provision is an unenforceable penalty because the amount awarded to CSG\nas liquidated damages is unreasonable. Southern Union claims that this is established simply by\nthe fact that the $2.1 million awarded to CSG pursuant to the discontinuance fee is double the\namount found by the jury as lost profits. A liquidated damages provision will be considered an\nunenforceable penalty if the amount awarded is so disproportionate to the actual or anticipated\ndamages that it in effect punishes the breach, thereby coercing performance of the contract by\nmaking it too costly to not adhere to its terms. 24 Williston on Contracts § 65:3, at 249 (4th\ned.2002); see also Kothe v. R.C. Taylor Trust, 280 U.S. 224, 226, 50 S.Ct. 142, 74 L.Ed. 382\n(1930).\n\nBut Southern Union fails to cite, and we are unaware of, any cases in support of its claim that a two-\nto-one ratio of liquidated-to-actual damages is unreasonable per se.There is, however, authority\nto the contrary. In Baker v. International Record Syndicate, Inc., our sister court approved a\nliquidated damages award of $51,000, which was more than triple the $15,000 found as actual\ndamages. 812 S.W.2d 53, 56 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1991, no writ). The Texas Supreme Court also\nupheld a trial court's judgment awarding $790,000 in liquidated damages, which was twice the\n$395,000 found as actual damages.Sealock v. Texas Fed. Sav. & Loan Assoc., 755 S.W.2d 69,\n70 (Tex.1988).\n\nSouthern Union seeks to distinguish such cases by urging that, even if it is normally reasonable to\naward liquidated damages in an amount that is double the actual damages, this ratio is unreasonable\nin a case where the amount at issue involves millions rather than thousands of dollars, as here.\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    7\n\fSouthern Union Co. v. CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\nAgain, while no cases support Southern Union's claim, there is authority to the contrary. In a case\ninvolving high-end commercial real estate, the Fifth Circuit held that a liquidated damages award\nof $5 million was reasonable, despite an internal memorandum stating that the anticipated damages\nwere $1.4 million.Thanksgiving Tower Partners v. Anros Thanksgiving Partners, 64 F.3d 227,\n232 (5th Cir.1995). Thus, as a matter of law, it is not unreasonable per se to award liquidated\ndamages in an amount that is double the actual damages. Moreover, in this case, the reasonableness\nof CSG's award is supported by the record.\n\nThe discontinuance fee expressly states that it “is not a penalty” and that it “is a reasonable\nestimation of the actual damages which CSG would suffer if CSG were to fail to receive the\namount of processing business as contemplated by this Agreement.”Although parties cannot\navoid a challenge to a liquidated damages provision simply by characterizing it as “reasonable,”\nsuch express language is instructive of the parties' intent when the terms are mutually bargained\nfor between equally competent parties. See Shel-al Corp., 492 F.2d at 94; Loggins Constr. Co.\nv. Stephen F. Austin State Univ. Bd. of Regents, 543 S.W.2d 682, 685 (Tex.App.-Tyler 1976,\nwrit ref'd). Southern Union's own witnesses testified that the language of the discontinuance fee\nprovision was bargained for and intended by the parties, and that the amount awarded under the\ndiscontinuance fee was reasonable. In response to questions on cross-examination, Stanley Mayer\nagreed that the provision was mutually negotiated, that he approved its terms, and that he knew\nSouthern Union would be responsible for paying the fee if it breached the contract. When David\nKvapil was asked whether he was aware at the time Southern Union filed suit against CSG “that\nthe calculation of the discontinuance fee would be approximately $2 million,” he responded that,\n“Yeah. I think that's what it calculates to.”Kvapil further agreed that Southern Union understood\nthe purpose of the discontinuance fee was “to compensate CSG for all the work they have done\nand all their expectation” and that this was “fair.”\n\n *7 The jury was asked to determine what amount would be “fair and reasonable” to award CSG\npursuant to the discontinuance fee, and it responded “$2.1 million.” A jury's findings on damages\nshould be upheld if there is sufficient evidence in the record to show that the amount is fair and\nreasonable compensation. Dillard Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Silva, 148 S.W.3d 370, 371 (Tex.2004).\nHere, the jury was entitled to make this finding based on both the express language of the contract\nand on the testimony of Southern Union's witnesses. We find that this is sufficient evidence from\nwhich the jury could determine that it was reasonable to award CSG $2.1 million in liquidated\ndamages. Southern Union's second issue is overruled.\n\n\nPrejudgment Interest\nSouthern Union urges in its third issue that, regardless of whether CSG is awarded lost profits or\nthe discontinuance fee, CSG is not entitled to recover prejudgment interest on either award because\nboth encompass elements of future damages, and section 304.1045 of the finance code, as amended\nin 2004, specifically prohibits recovery of prejudgment interest on awards of future damages.\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Fin.Code Ann. § 304.1045 (West Supp.2004-05). CSG counters that the finance code does\nnot prevent prejudgment interest in this case because, by its express terms, the provision only\napplies to cases involving “wrongful death, personal injury, or property damage.”Tex. Fin.Code\nAnn. §§ 304.101, .1045 (West 1998 & Supp.2004-05). Southern Union asserts in response that,\ndespite its express terms, section 304.1045 prevents prejudgment interest here based on the Texas\nSupreme Court's holding that the statutory framework should be applied to all cases, not just those\ninvolving “wrongful death, personal injury, and property damage.”Johnson & Higgins of Tex.,\nInc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc., 962 S.W.2d 507, 514, 530 (Tex.1998). CSG argues, however, that\neven if section 304.1045 prevents prejudgment interest on future damages in a breach-of-contract\ncase, it is still proper for CSG to recover prejudgment interest on the amount awarded as the\ndiscontinuance fee because it is an award of liquidated, not future, damages. We review the trial\ncourt's award of prejudgment interest for an abuse of discretion. Purcell Const., Inc. v. Welch, 17\nS.W.3d 398, 402 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, no pet.).\n\nSouthern Union and CSG agree that the discontinuance fee was intended to be a liquidated\ndamages provision. Liquidated damages are given in lieu of actual damages and thus they are not\nconsidered “future damages,” even though aspects of the liquidated award may compensate the\nparty for what would have otherwise been recovered as future losses. See Lafarge Corp. v. Wolff,\nInc., 977 S.W.2d 181, 188 n. 13 (Tex.App.-Austin 1998, pet. denied); Eberts v. Businesspeople\nPersonnel Servs., Inc., 620 S.W.2d 861, 864-65 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1981, no writ). Liquidated\ndamages are distinct from future damages because the measure of liquidated damages is stipulated\nto before the occurrence of a breach and thus, unlike future damages, the amount of liquidated\ndamages can be immediately ascertained at the time of the breach. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at\n788. It is permissible for a trial court to award prejudgment interest when a contract “provides the\nconditions on which liability depends and ... fixes a measure by which the sum payable can be\nascertained with reasonable certainty.”Wheat v. American Title Ins. Co., 751 S.W.2d 943, 944-45\n(Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, no writ); see also Sealock, 755 S.W.2d. at 70 (upholding\naward of prejudgment interest on liquidated damages); Perry Roofing Co. v. Olcott, 744 S.W.2d\n929, 932 (Tex.1988) (Wallace, J., dissenting) (“The Legislature has given contracting parties\nnotice that if they enter into and subsequently breach agreements in which damages are liquidated\nor otherwise ascertainable, they may be held liable for prejudgment interest. Parties to contracts\nhave always had this corresponding obligation and right....”).\n\n *8 We decline to reach the issue of whether the finance code prevents recovery of prejudgment\ninterest on future damages in a breach-of-contract case because we agree with CSG's argument\nthat liquidated damages are distinct from future damages and, as such, section 304.1045 does not\nprohibit the recovery of prejudgment interest on liquidated damages. The trial court therefore did\nnot abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest to CSG on the $2.1 million it recovered\npursuant to the discontinuance fee.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The jury expressly stated in the verdict that if Southern Union returned the\nsoftware licenses provided to it by CSG, then CSG would be entitled to zero damages for the\nlicenses. It is undisputed that Southern Union returned the licenses. The trial court awarded CSG\n$140,000 for the licenses, over Southern Union's objection. CSG does not oppose a remittitur of\n$140,000.

Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC, 334 S.W.3d 275 (2010)\n\n\n\n\nDavid Watkin Jones, Beck, Redden & Secrest, LLP, Houston, TX, for Appellee.\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice RADACK and Justices BLAND and MASSENGALE.\n\n\n\n                                      OPINION ON REHEARING\n\nJANE BLAND, Justice.\n\nIn this dispute over an earnest money contract to develop a plat of real estate, the trial court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC (Meritage) on its breach of contract\nclaim against SP Terrace, LP, and Tyee Management, LLC (collectively, SP Terrace). The trial\ncourt summarily rejected SP Terrace's counterclaims for breach of contract against Meritage.\n\nThe contract called for SP Terrace to file a subdivision plat by December 31, 2005. SP Terrace\nconcedes that it did not meet this deadline. But it argues that the contract extended the deadline, or\nalternatively that its compliance was excused. It claims fact issues exist on its affirmative defenses\nof oral modification, waiver, delay and interference by Meritage, on the amount of attorney's fees,\nand on its counterclaim against Meritage. We conclude that SP Terrace raises a fact issue on the\nissues of waiver and delay, but not as to contract modification or interference. We therefore reverse\nthe trial court's summary judgment and remand the case for trial. We grant rehearing and withdraw\nour opinion and judgment dated May 6, 2010, to address an argument that SP Terrace raises in its\nmotion for rehearing. Our disposition is unchanged.\n\n\n\n                                                 Background\n\nUnderlying Facts\nSP Terrace entered into an earnest money contract with Meritage to develop and sell ninety-six lots\nin a proposed Harris County subdivision. The development plan required small and narrow lots,\nand Meritage was one of a few builders who could construct houses to fit the particular lot sizes.\nThe contract terms required SP Terrace to improve the overall subdivision. In particular, it required\nSP Terrace to file a subdivision plat with Harris County by a December 31, 2005 substantial\ncompletion deadline. After substantial completion, Meritage would then purchase the lots in a\nseries of transactions. The total purchase price was $2,688,000. Meritage deposited ten percent of\nthis price, $268,000, with SP Terrace as earnest money. If SP Terrace did not achieve substantial\ncompletion by December 31, 2005, Meritage could terminate the contract and recover its earnest\nmoney deposit. But, if Meritage delayed SP Terrace's performance of its contractual obligations,\nthe substantial completion deadline would “be extended to the extent of any such delay.”\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC, 334 S.W.3d 275 (2010)\n\n\n\nOn November 30, representatives from Meritage and SP Terrace met to discuss *280 the project.\nAt this point, SP Terrace was ready to file the subdivision plat. Meritage asked for changes to the\nplat, and it requested that SP Terrace postpone filing the plat to accommodate those changes. SP\nTerrace agreed, but informed Meritage that a six-month extension of the substantial completion\ndeadline would be necessary to address these and any future changes to the development.\nAccording to Tyler Todd, the president of Tyee Management, SP Terrace's general partner, and\nKelly Smalley, the project manager, the parties orally agreed to extend the substantial completion\ndeadline, and the representatives of Meritage agreed to sign a written extension memorializing the\noral modification. Smalley mailed a written agreement to Meritage before December 31, 2005.\nShe never received a response.\n\nThe parties continued to work together to make changes and improvements to the development into\nearly February 2006. But on February 3, Meritage informed SP Terrace that, due to SP Terrace's\nfailure to meet the substantial completion deadline, Meritage was terminating the contract and\ndemanding the return of its earnest money deposit.\n\n\nProcedural History\nAfter SP Terrace refused to return the earnest money deposit, Meritage sued for breach of contract.\nSP Terrace counterclaimed for breach of contract, alleging that Meritage (1) delayed SP Terrace's\nperformance, (2) failed to cooperate with SP Terrace, and (3) breached their oral agreement to\nextend the substantial completion deadline by six months, all of which entitled SP Terrace to retain\nthe earnest money deposit and recover actual damages in addition to the earnest money it kept.\n\nMeritage moved for traditional and no-evidence summary judgment on its claims against SP\nTerrace and on SP Terrace's counterclaim. Meritage contended that the parties never agreed to\nextend the substantial completion deadline. Meritage argued that SP Terrace's counterclaim failed\nas a matter of law because it did not state a claim for affirmative relief and the liquidated damages\nprovision in the contract precluded SP Terrace from recovering actual damages in excess of\nthe earnest money deposit. Meritage contended that SP Terrace's waiver defense failed because\nMeritage never renounced its right to terminate the contract, and the forty-eight days that had\npassed between the substantial completion deadline and the date Meritage demanded the return of\nits earnest money deposit was not long enough to show that Meritage intended to yield its right to\nterminate. Meritage argued that any oral modification of the contract is unenforceable because it\nmaterially altered the obligations of the underlying written contract. Meritage also noted that SP\nTerrace failed to present any evidence that the amount of liquidated damages was an unreasonable\nforecast of the amount of its damages.\n\nSP Terrace responded with the Todd and Smalley affidavits to show that fact issues existed\nregarding (1) an agreement to extend the substantial completion deadline; (2) whether Meritage,\nthrough its oral agreement to extend the deadline and its continued work with SP Terrace after\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC, 334 S.W.3d 275 (2010)\n\n\n\nDecember 31, 2005, waived the deadline; and (3) whether Meritage breached its duties to cooperate\nwith SP Terrace and to not delay or interfere with SP Terrace's performance of its contractual\nobligations. SP Terrace also argued that the liquidated damages provision of the contract, which\nlimited SP Terrace's recovery to retention of the earnest money deposit, was unenforceable penalty\nbecause it hypothetically would allow the forfeiture of the deposit due to any breach by Meritage,\nincluding a trivial one.\n\n *281 The trial court granted Meritage's motions. Shortly thereafter, Meritage moved for entry of\na final judgment, asking the trial court to award it $268,000 in damages, $71,170.50 in attorney's\nfees incurred in prosecuting its claims in the trial court proceedings, $40,000 in attorney's fees if\nSP Terrace appeals to an intermediate appellate court, and an additional $27,500 in attorney's fees\nif Meritage ultimately prevails after full briefing and oral argument to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\nSP Terrace moved the trial court to reconsider the summary judgment. SP Terrace attached\nexcerpts from the deposition of Michael Pizzitola, taken after the original submission of the\nsummary judgment motions, to further support its contentions. SP Terrace also attached the\naffidavit of its counsel of record opposing Meritage's requested amount of attorney's fees. The trial\ncourt's docket sheet includes the following entry for December 8, 2008: “D. (seller) Motion for\nleave of court to file additional evidence granted.” The trial court did not memorialize the docket\nentry in any order, even though SP Terrace submitted a proposed order and requested that the trial\ncourt sign it. The trial court entered a final judgment in favor of Meritage, awarding the $268,000\nearnest money deposit as damages and the full amount of attorney's fees requested by Meritage.\n\n\n\n                                                  Discussion\n\nStandard of Review\nWe review de novo the trial court's grant of a motion for summary judgment.

TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(i). Once a party moves for no-evidence summary judgment, the\nburden shifts to the non-movant to present evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact on each\nelement specified in the motion.

Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC, 334 S.W.3d 275 (2010)\n\n\n\n [1] [2] [3] When we construe a contract, we must “ascertain and give effect to the parties'\nintentions as expressed in the document.” Frost Nat'l Bank v. L & F Distribs., Ltd., 165 S.W.3d\n310, 311–12 (Tex.2005) (per curiam). We consider the contract as a whole in order to give effect\nto all provisions of the contract. See id. at 312. We give contractual terms their plain, ordinary, and\ngenerally accepted meaning unless the contract shows that the parties intended a different meaning\nto control. See Heritage Res. v. NationsBank, 939 S.W.2d 118, 121 (Tex.1996).\n\n\nLate–Filed Summary Judgment Evidence\n [4] [5] SP Terrace initially contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\nbecause the late-filed deposition testimony of Meritage's Michael Pizzitola creates fact issues.\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c) provides that “[e]xcept on leave of court, the adverse party,\nnot later than seven days prior to the day of hearing may file and serve opposing affidavits or other\nwritten response.” TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c). A trial court may accept late-filed summary judgment\nevidence, but it must affirmatively indicate that it accepted or considered that *282 evidence. See\nStephens v. Dolcefino, 126 S.W.3d 120, 133–34 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied).\nIf no order in the record indicates that the court gave leave to file untimely evidence, then we\npresume that the trial court did not consider the evidence. See Benchmark Bank v. Crowder, 919\nS.W.2d 657, 663 (Tex.1996); Dixon v. E.D. Bullard Co., 138 S.W.3d 373, 375–76 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet. granted, judgm't vacated w.r.m.); Farmer v. Ben E. Keith Co., 919\nS.W.2d 171, 176 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1996, no writ).\n\n [6] SP Terrace relies on the trial court's docket entry as sufficient indication that the trial court\ngranted it leave to late-file the Pizzitola deposition as summary-judgment evidence. We previously\nhave held, however, that a docket entry “forms no part of the record we may consider; it is a\nmemorandum made for the trial court and clerk's convenience. This rule results, in part, from\nthe inherent unreliability of docket entries.” Miller v. Kendall, 804 S.W.2d 933, 944 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1990, no writ) (citing Energo Int'l Corp. v. Modern Indus. Heating, Inc., 722\nS.W.2d 149, 151–52 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1986, no writ) (“Consequently, there is no indication in the\nrecord that permission of the court was requested or obtained to file the amended answer and that\nthe amended answer was properly before the court.”)). SP Terrace contends that our holding in\nDolcefino supports its argument despite these cases. In Dolcefino, however, the trial judge stated\non the record at the motion for reconsideration hearing that “the court will include the evidence\noffered today in the summary judgment record. The court, even taking this evidence into the record,\ndenies Plaintiff's motion for new trial.” See Dolcefino, 126 S.W.3d at 134. We noted that the trial\njudge's statement on the record indicated that the judge had accepted the evidence as belatedly\noffered summary judgment evidence. See id. Here, in contrast, SP Terrace requested that the trial\ncourt sign an order granting leave to file the additional evidence that it had attached to the motion\nfor reconsideration. It attached the docket sheet and a proposed order, but the trial court never\nentered the order. Following Miller, we decline to extend the Dolcefino analysis to docket sheet\nentries, and thus hold that this evidence is not part of the summary judgment record.\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC, 334 S.W.3d 275 (2010)\n\n\n\n\n [7] In a similar vein, Meritage, in its response to SP Terrace's motion for reconsideration, attached\nexcerpts from the deposition of Tyler Todd that it had not previously filed with the trial court.\nMeritage did not request leave of court to late-file these excerpts from Todd's deposition, and thus\nthese excerpts do not form part of the summary judgment record. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c);\nDolcefino, 126 S.W.3d at 133.\n\n\nOral Modification of the Substantial Completion Deadline\n [8] Turning to the merits, SP Terrace first contends that an oral modification to the contract exists\nand thus it is not liable for any breach associated with missing the December 31 deadline. Under\nthe statute of frauds, a contract for the sale of real estate must be in writing and signed by the party\ncharged with compliance with its terms. TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 26.01(b)(4) (Vernon\n2009). Generally, if a contract falls within the statute of frauds, then a party cannot enforce any\nsubsequent oral material modification to the contract. See Dracopoulas v. Rachal, 411 S.W.2d\n719, 721 (Tex.1967); see also Walker v. Tafralian, 107 S.W.3d 665, 670 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth\n2003, pet. denied).\n\nIn Dracopoulas, the Texas Supreme Court held unenforceable an oral modification *283 that\nextended the time for performance indefinitely. See Dracopoulas, 411 S.W.2d at 722. The court\nreasoned that the termination date of the contract was the “hinge upon which still other contractual\nrights and duties turn,” and extending the termination date indefinitely would destroy other\ncontractual provisions that depended on the termination date to become operative. See id.; see also\nKing v. Texacally Joint Venture, 690 S.W.2d 618, 620 (Tex.App.-Austin 1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.)\n(“It has been held that attempted alteration of the time for performance in real estate contracts\nis a material alteration.” (citing Vendig v. Traylor, 604 S.W.2d 424 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1980,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.))). But see Triton Comm'l Props., Ltd. v. Norwest Bank Tex., N.A., 1 S.W.3d 814,\n819 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1999, pet. denied) (holding that extending the time for performance\ndoes not, by itself, materially alter the underlying obligations, even if the contract would otherwise\nterminate). In the right circumstances, an extension for the time for performance can be a material\nalteration.\n\n [9] This case presents one of those circumstances. Even if the oral modification extending\nperformance would not ordinarily materially alter the underlying written contract, when a party\nrelies on the modification to assert that the other party is in material breach to excuse further\nperformance, the modification then becomes material and unenforceable unless in writing. See\nWalker, 107 S.W.3d at 670; King, 690 S.W.2d at 620.\n\n [10] Todd and Smalley described the November 30 meeting between Meritage and SP Terrace\nrepresentatives. Each averred that, at this meeting, Meritage representatives requested that SP\nTerrace delay filing the subdivision plat to allow the parties to continue making changes to\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

SP Terrace agreed, but requested a six-month extension of the December 31\ndeadline. According to Todd and Smalley, Meritage's representatives agreed to extend the deadline\nand to sign a written agreement confirming that extension. Smalley mailed a written extension to\nMeritage before December 31, and although Meritage never returned a signed extension, it also\nnever objected.\n\nMeritage points to a January 20, 2006, letter from Smalley to Steve Harding as evidence that the\nparties did not agree to extend the deadline:\n\n            I had previously sent you an addendum to the Earnest Money Contract prior to\n            the end of the year extending the date of the contract to June 30, 2006. As of this\n            date, I have not received an executed addendum. I know there are still questions\n            to be answered, but we need some assurance that we can reach an agreement\n            and declare some sort of modified substantial completion.\n\nIt is thus undisputed that the parties never signed a written agreement to extend the deadline beyond\nDecember 31. In addition, SP Terrace viewed the extension of time to be a material alteration to\nthe contract, sufficient to excuse it from further performance, stating to the trial court:\n\n            Meritage agreed to extend the substantial completion date and/or caused a\n            default or delay in the substantial completion. Meritage then refused to perform\n            under the Contract by its February 3, 2006 letter. This evidence is sufficient to\n            show a prior or anticipatory breach by Meritage, which would excuse further\n            performance by SP Terrace.\n\nSP Terrace thus asserts that Meritage's breach of the alleged oral extension of the substantial\ncompletion deadline was sufficient to excuse any further performance by SP Terrace. The\nmodification here is a *284 material term—as such, it is unenforceable because it was never\nreduced to writing. See Walker, 107 S.W.3d at 670; King, 690 S.W.2d at 620. We hold that the trial\ncourt correctly granted summary judgment on SP Terrace's affirmative defense of modification.\n\n\nWaiver of the Substantial Completion Deadline\n [11] [12] SP Terrace next contends that a fact issue exists regarding Meritage's waiver of the\nDecember 31 deadline. A party establishes waiver by demonstrating (1) the express renunciation\nof a known right or (2) silence or inaction for so long as to show the intent to yield a known right.\nSee Motor Vehicle Bd. v. El Paso Indep. Auto Dealers, 1 S.W.3d 108, 111 (Tex.1999). Waiver\ncan also result from acts that induce the other party to believe that the party will not insist on exact\nperformance within the contractual time limits. See Kennedy Ship & Repair, LP v. Pham, 210\nS.W.3d 11, 20 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.); see also KMI Continental Offshore\nProd. Co. v. ACF Petrol. Co., 746 S.W.2d 238, 243 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   7\n\fSP Terrace, L.P. v. Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC, 334 S.W.3d 275 (2010)\n\n\n\ndenied) (“[A] waiver can occur if a party knowingly possessing the right acts in such a manner\nthat the party misleads the opposing party into believing that a waiver has occurred.”); Alford,\nMeroney & Co. v. Rowe, 619 S.W.2d 210, 213 (Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\n [13] [14] [15] The surrounding facts and circumstances must plainly demonstrate a party's\nintent to waive a known right. See El Paso Indep. Auto Dealers, 1 S.W.3d at 111. Waiver may\nresult when: (1) a party assents to the other party's continued performance without objection to\nthe delay; (2) a party states that it will not require strict compliance with a deadline or acts such\nthat the other party reasonably believes strict compliance will not be required; or (3) a party insists\non performance by the other party even after breach of the agreement. See Delgado v. Methodist\nHosp., 936 S.W.2d 479, 485 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, no writ); Fairfield Fin. Group,\nInc. v. Gawerc, 814 S.W.2d 204, 209 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1991, no writ); Seismic &\nDigital Concepts, Inc. v. Digital Res. Corp., 590 S.W.2d 718, 721 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [1st\nDist.] 1979, no writ). Ordinarily waiver is a fact question; however, we decide a waiver issue as a\nmatter of law if the facts and circumstances are admitted or established. See El Paso Indep. Auto\nDealers, 1 S.W.3d at 111.\n\n [16] Todd and Smalley aver that, at the end of November, SP Terrace was prepared to file the\nsubdivision plat, but delayed the filing at Meritage's request. They both averred that they told\nMeritage that delaying the filing of the plat would require a six-month extension of the substantial\ncompletion deadline and that Meritage orally agreed to this extension, which suggested to them that\nMeritage would not insist upon the December 31 deadline. Smalley further averred that she mailed\nthe written extension prior to December 31 and never received any objections to the extension.\nTodd and Smalley continued to work with Meritage on the development into February 2006.\nSmalley participated in a January 10, 2006, meeting with Steve Harding of Meritage to “discuss\nthe proposed subdivision changes.”\n\nMeritage cites Beal Bank, S.S.B. v. Schleider, 124 S.W.3d 640 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n2003, pet. denied), to support its contention that SP Terrace does not raise a fact issue on waiver.\nIn Beal Bank, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals held that representations that “an extension would\nnot be a problem,” the parties were “set to go,” and the bank would “get *285 back to” Schleider\nwere insufficient to establish waiver. See id. at 654. In contrast, here, Todd and Smalley aver that\nMeritage continued to participate in meetings with SP Terrace representatives and work with SP\nTerrace on further changes to the development even after the December 31 deadline, indicating\nthat it continued to insist on performance after breach of the agreement. In his affidavit, Tyler Todd\nstates that SP Terrace “continued to work with [Meritage] under the Contract and to accommodate\nchanges requested by [Meritage] throughout December 2005, January 2006, and into February\n2006.” Kelly Smalley states that a Meritage representative participated in a meeting to discuss the\nproposed subdivision changes on January 10, 2006, after the deadline. We hold that SP Terrace\nraises a fact issue as to whether Meritage waived the December 31 substantial completion deadline\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC, 334 S.W.3d 275 (2010)\n\n\n\nand its right to terminate the contract on this basis, particularly in light of the contract provision\nthat the substantial completion deadline “would be extended” to the extent of any delay caused by\nMeritage. See Delgado, 936 S.W.2d at 485 (“A party to a contract may effectively waive a breach\nby the other party by continuing to insist on performance by the other party even after a breach.”).\n\n\nDelay and Interference by Meritage\nSP Terrace contends that fact issues exist as to whether Meritage caused delays and interfered\nwith SP Terrace's performance of its contractual obligations thus breaching an implied duty to\ncooperate.\n\n [17] [18] [19] We examine the written contract to determine the obligations of the parties. See\nBank One, Tex., N.A. v. Stewart, 967 S.W.2d 419, 435 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, pet.\ndenied), cited with approval in Keck v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co., 20 S.W.3d 692, 701 (Tex.2000);\nNalle v. Taco Bell Corp., 914 S.W.2d 685, 687 (Tex.App.-Austin 1996, writ denied). We do not\nimply a covenant regarding a matter specifically covered by the terms of the written contract, but\nwe imply a duty to cooperate to the extent necessary for the contract's performance. See Stewart,\n967 S.W.2d at 434. Thus, a party cannot “hinder, prevent, or interfere with [another's] ability to\nperform [its] duties under [the] agreement.” See id. at 435. The implied covenant to cooperate\ndiffers from the broader implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which the Texas Supreme\nCourt has rejected. See Case Corp. v. Hi–Class Bus. Sys. of Am., Inc., 184 S.W.3d 760, 770\n(Tex.App.-Dallas 2005, pet. denied) (citing Tex. Nat'l Bank v. Sandia Mtg. Corp., 872 F.2d 692,\n698–99 (5th Cir.1989)).\n\n [20] [21] When one party prevents another from timely performing its contractual obligations,\nthe failure to timely perform is excused. See Anderson Dev. Corp. v. Coastal States Crude\nGathering Co., 543 S.W.2d 402, 406 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.);\nsee also Dorsett v. Cross, 106 S.W.3d 213, 217 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, no pet.)\n(“Prevention of performance by one party excuses performance by the other party.”). According\nto Todd and Smalley, SP Terrace prepared to file the subdivision plat in November 2005, but at\nMeritage's request, it delayed filing it. Smalley also stated the following:\n\n            The development was often delayed by lack of information, delays in approvals\n            and changes in plans and designs from [Meritage]. For example, I could not\n            obtain timely approval from [Meritage] for finalizing the design of the fences,\n            the location of the electrical service, Steve Harding's failure to attend a meeting\n            on November 16, 2005 with CenterPoint Energy and failure to respond to\n            CenterPoint Energy on various *286 issues. These failures and delays caused\n            a delay in the substantial completion of the subdivision.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC, 334 S.W.3d 275 (2010)\n\n\n\n\nSection 16(k) of the contract provides that: “Seller [SP Terrace] shall not be responsible for any\ndamage or delay caused by Purchaser [Meritage] or Purchaser's agent ... and the time limits for\nSeller's performance hereunder shall be extended to the extent of any such delay.” 1 We hold\nthat SP Terrace's summary judgment evidence raises a fact issue as to whether a delay caused by\nMeritage extended the substantial completion deadline.\n\n\nSummary Judgment on SP Terrace's Counterclaim\nSP Terrace also sues Meritage for breach of contract, and seeks damages beyond the earnest money\ndeposit. The trial court rejected this claim, and SP Terrace appeals. Meritage responds that SP\nTerrace's counterclaim is not one for affirmative relief, but in any event, SP Terrace's recovery is\nlimited to the earnest money contract.\n\n\nA. Claim for Affirmative Relief\n [22] [23] Meritage argues that SP Terrace's asserted contractual defense to the refund of\nMeritage's earnest money deposit is not an affirmative claim for relief. To qualify as a claim for\naffirmative relief, the defendant must allege a cause of action independent of the plaintiff's claim,\non which the defendant can recover benefits, compensation, or relief, even though the plaintiff\nmay abandon or fail to establish its claim. See Gen. Land Office v. OXY USA, Inc., 789 S.W.2d\n569, 570 (Tex.1990). If the defendant only resists the plaintiff's right to recover, then it does not\nstate a claim for affirmative relief. See id.\n\nIn its “Second Amended Answer and First Amended Counterclaim,” SP Terrace stated that\nMeritage's “actions, promises and representations” constituted a prior breach of the contract by\nMeritage, which excused SP Terrace from further performance and entitled SP Terrace to retain the\nearnest money deposit and recover actual damages, including lost profits, of at least $1,400,000.\n\n [24] Meritage argues that because SP Terrace always possessed the earnest money deposit, and\nif SP Terrace prevailed or Meritage abandoned its claim, SP Terrace would simply retain the\nearnest money. Therefore, SP Terrace's counterclaim, which asks the trial court to determine\nthat SP Terrace is entitled to the earnest money, is essentially a claim for declaratory relief.\nWe disagree. SP Terrace asked the trial court to determine it has a right to the earnest money\ndeposit, but it also seeks actual damages beyond the earnest money deposit. See Howell v. Mauzy,\n899 S.W.2d 690, 706 (Tex.App.-Austin 1994, writ denied) (“A court may allow a declaratory-\njudgment counterclaim, however, if it is something more than a mere denial of the plaintiff's\nclaim and has greater ramifications than the original suit. A counterclaim has greater ramifications\nthan the original suit if it seeks affirmative relief.”) (internal citations omitted). We hold that SP\nTerrace's allegations state a claim for relief independent of Meritage's breach of contract *287\nclaim. If the trier of fact concludes that Meritage has waived performance of the substantial\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC, 334 S.W.3d 275 (2010)\n\n\n\ncompletion deadline and was in breach of the agreement, then SP Terrace is entitled to pursue its\nclaim for breach.\n\n\nB. Earnest Money as Liquidated Damages\n [25] SP Terrace asked the trial court to set aside the earnest money liquidated damages provision\nfor a breach by Meritage, contending that it penalizes Meritage because it requires Meritage to\nforfeit its earnest money no matter how trivial its breach. SP Terrace requests this interpretation\nof the contract so that its damages claim against Meritage can exceed the earnest money deposit\nit kept after Meritage terminated the contract. The clause in question provides that, upon default\nby Meritage, SP Terrace, as its sole remedy, may terminate the contract and retain the earnest\nmoney deposit.\n\n [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] We enforce a liquidated damages clause if (1) the harm caused\nby the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) the amount of liquidated damages\nis a reasonable forecast of just compensation. See Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 788\n(Tex.1991). An assertion that a liquidated damages provision constitutes an unenforceable penalty\nis an affirmative defense, and the party asserting penalty bears the burden of proof. See Urban\nTelevision Network Corp. v. Liquidity Solutions, 277 S.W.3d 917, 919 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2009,\nno pet.); Fluid Concepts, Inc. v. DA Apts., LP, 159 S.W.3d 226, 231 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005, no\npet.). Generally, that party must prove the amount of actual damages, if any, to demonstrate that\n“the actual loss was not an approximation of the stipulated sum.” Baker v. Int'l Record Syndicate,\nInc., 812 S.W.2d 53, 55 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1991, no writ). If the amount stipulated in the liquidated\ndamages clause is “shown to be disproportionate to actual damages,” we should declare that\nthe clause is a penalty and limit recovery to actual damages. Johnson Eng'rs, Inc. v. Tri–Water\nSupply Corp., 582 S.W.2d 555, 557 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1979, no writ); see also TEX. BUS.\n& COM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a) (Vernon 2009) (“A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated\ndamages is void as a penalty.”). Whether a liquidated damages clause is an unenforceable penalty\nis a question of law for the court, but sometimes factual issues must be resolved before the court\ncan decide the legal question. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. For example, in Phillips, the\nTexas Supreme Court observed that “to show that a liquidated damages provision is unreasonable\nbecause the actual damages incurred were much less than the amount contracted for, a defendant\nmay be required to prove what the actual damages were.” Id.\n\n [31] SP Terrace adduced no evidence in the trial court that Meritage's forfeit of its earnest money\noperated as a penalty because Meritage's breach was a trivial one. Its aim was just the opposite—\nit was to prove that Meritage's breach caused damages far higher than the earnest money amount,\nalthough it offered no proof of that theory either. We decline to remove a limitation of remedy\nprovision absent any evidence that the liquidated amount in the contract is unreasonably high or\nlow in light of the alleged breach. See Urban Television, 277 S.W.3d at 919; Fluid Concepts, Inc.,\n159 S.W.3d at 231.\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC, 334 S.W.3d 275 (2010)\n\n\n\n\nSP Terrace relies on cases in which courts have disregarded liquidated damages provisions as\nunreasonable in their approximation of actual damages for trivial breaches. See Stewart v. Basey,\n150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484, 487 (1952) ( “Our conclusion is that, since the contract provided\nthe same reparation for the breach of each *288 and every covenant, and since it would be\nunreasonable and a violation of the principle of just compensation to enforce it as to some of them,\nthe provision for stipulated damages should be treated as a penalty.”); Community Dev. Serv.,\nInc. v. Replacement Parts Mfg., Inc., 679 S.W.2d 721, 727 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1984,\nno writ) (holding that liquidated damages clause in earnest money contract was unenforceable\npenalty, because even though it provided reasonable damages for major breaches of the contract,\nit also allowed unreasonable damages for trivial breaches); Bethel v. Butler Drilling Co., 635\nS.W.2d 834, 837–38 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (holding same). These\ncases are distinguishable in that either it was the breaching party who argued that the provision\nwas a penalty, or in that the party seeking to set aside the provision adduced evidence that the\nliquidated damages clause was not a reasonable approximation of damages caused by the breach.\nSee Stewart, 245 S.W.2d at 487 (where actual damages incurred by breaching party amounted\nto $38.50, “stipulation to pay several thousand dollars ... would be so unreasonable that no court\nwould lend its power to enforce it”); Community Dev., 679 S.W.2d at 727 (jury findings and\nevidence supported claim that earnest money provision operated as penalty); Bethel, 635 S.W.2d\nat 843 (upholding trial court's determination that liquidated damages clause was penalty against\nbreaching party, and limiting plaintiff's recovery to actual damages).\n\n [32] A liquidated damages provision is a penalty if it punishes the breaching party by subjecting it\nto a disproportionately high amount of damages relative to reasonably anticipated actual damages.\nAbsent evidence that the earnest money amount here was not a reasonable approximation of an\nanticipated breach, limiting recovery to the earnest money deposit and preventing a party from\nrecovering actual damages in excess of the bargained for liquidated amount does not constitute\na penalty to the breaching party. 2 We decline to hold as a matter of law that the earnest money\nprovision in this case is a penalty. Cf. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788–89 (no fact issue that provision\nwas penalty against breaching party because it provided that actual damages be determined and\nmultiplied tenfold).\n\n\nRequired Notice to Recover Earnest Money\n [33] Finally, SP Terrace contends that it did not receive thirty days' notice and an opportunity to\ncure the default. Section 9(c) of the contract states:\n\n            In the event Seller shall default in Seller's obligations hereunder ... Purchaser\n            shall give Seller thirty (30) days written notice and opportunity to cure such\n            default. If Seller fails to cure its default within the thirty day period provided in\n             *289 the notice, Purchaser, as its sole and exclusive remedies, may either (i)\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meritage Homes of Texas, LLC, 334 S.W.3d 275 (2010)\n\n\n\n             terminate this Contract and obtain the return of its Earnest Money or (ii) enforce\n             specific performance of Seller's obligation to convey the Lot(s) upon payment\n             of the Purchase Price.\n\nMeritage responds that the contract does not require notice and an opportunity to cure because\nsection 4(i) states that if “Substantial Completion does not occur by December 31, 2005 at option\nof Purchaser this Contract shall terminate and Purchaser is relieved of any obligation hereunder.”\nWe agree, and hold that once Meritage exercised its option to terminate due to SP Terrace's\nfailure to meet the deadline, Meritage was relieved of further contractual obligations, including\nthe requirement of providing notice and an opportunity to cure. Reading the contract to require\nnotice and an opportunity to cure before recovering the earnest money, even if SP Terrace did\nnot achieve substantial completion by December 31, would render section 4(i)'s provision that\nfailure to achieve substantial completion by December 31 relieves Meritage of any contractual\nobligation a nullity. See J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 229 (Tex.2003) (“[W]e\nmust examine and consider the entire writing in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all the\nprovisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless.”). We therefore hold that SP\nTerrace was not entitled to notice and a thirty day opportunity to cure any failure to comply with\nthe substantial completion deadline.\n\n\n\n                                                              Conclusion\n\nWe hold that SP Terrace failed to raise a fact issue on its affirmative defenses of modification\nand interference by Meritage, but raises fact issues whether Meritage waived performance of the\nDecember 31 substantial completion deadline and whether Meritage caused delay that extended\nthe time for performance. We further hold that SP Terrace's counterclaim states a claim for\naffirmative relief, but that SP Terrace fails to prove on this record that the earnest money provision\nof the contract is unenforceable as a matter of law. We therefore reverse and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings. 3\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The contract provides in section 16(k) that the substantial completion deadline “would be extended” if Meritage caused the delay\n       of the deadline. Meritage argued in the trial court that SP Terrace's reference to section 16(k) in an amended pleading filed after its\n       motion for partial summary judgment was filed came too late to support its contractual defenses. We disagree, in so much as SP\n       Terrace expressly argued in its summary judgment response that “by words, actions and inaction, Meritage caused the default and/\n       or delay in the substantial completion.”\n2      Other jurisdictions that have addressed this issue have held similarly, and refused to strike the liquidated damages provision on the\n       ground that it is an unenforceable penalty. See, e.g., Mahoney v. Tingley, 85 Wash.2d 95, 529 P.2d 1068, 1070 (1975) (“A penalty\n       exists where there is an attempt to enforce an obligation to pay a sum fixed by agreement of the parties as a punishment for the\n       failure to fulfill some primary contractual obligation. In this case, it is not the party in default who seeks relief from an excessively\n       high liquidated damages provision. Rather, the provision operates to limit the recovery of the party who incurred a loss as a result\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

C. Stewart and wife against James Marvin Basey for damages for breach of lease\ncontract. The 126th District Court, Travis County, Jack Roberts, J., held that provisions in lease\ncontract was for a penalty and rendered judgment for plaintiff in the sum of $38.50 and plaintiffs\nappealed. The Austin Court of Civil Appeals of the Third Supreme Judicial District, Gray, J., 241\nS.W.2d 353, reversed portion of judgment awarding $38.50 as damages and remanded the cause\nand plaintiff brought error. The Supreme Court, Hickman, C.

The trial court construed it as a provision for a penalty and, finding that the lessor suffered\nno damages by lessee's breach except $38.50 caused by the destruction of a partition door in one of\nthe leased buildings, rendered judgment for that amount only. The Court of Civil Appeals upheld\nthe trial court in its refusal to award liquidated damages, but reversed that portion of the judgment\nawarding only $38.50 as damages and remanded the case to the trial court for the sole purpose of\ndetermining the amount of actual damages sustained by the lessor.

Basey, 150 Tex. 666 (1952)\n245 S.W.2d 484\n\n\nBy a contract in writing petitioners, E. C. Stewart and wife, leased to respondent, James Marvin\nBasey, three store buildings on South Congress Avenue in the city of Austin. The lease stated that\nit was for a term of five years, beginning on January 1, 1949, and ending at midnight on December\n31, 1954. The dates cover a period of six years, but for the purposes of this opinion it is immaterial\nwhether the term was five years or six years. The lease provided for a monthly rental of $325.00,\npayable each month in advance. Respondent went into possession under the lease and paid the\nmonthly rentals through November, 1949, during which month he vacated the buildings. On the\nfollowing December 5th the keys were returned to petitioners upon their request, since which time\nthey have executed leases to other tenants. The provision of the contract which we are called upon\nto construe reads as follows: ‘The failure to pay any monthly installment of rental when such\ninstallment is due shall terminate this lease at the option of Lessors. The failure of Lessee to make\nsaid payment or payments or the breach of this contract otherwise by him shall render him liable\nto Lessors, as agreed liquidated damages, the sum of One Hundred Fifty (150) Dollars per month\nfor each and every month of the unexpired term of this lease which shall become due and payable\nwhen the option to terminate this lease is exercised or at the time of the breach of this contract\notherwise by Lessee if any, and the payment thereof be secured by lien on the property of Lessee\nin said Store Buildings at said time.’\n\nAnother provision of the contract is: ‘That the violation of any term of this lease by either party\nhereto shall terminate the same at the option of the other.’\n\nIt will be observed that liability for the payment of $150.00 *669 per month as liquidated damages\nis not limited to the breach of any one particular covenant of the contract. The covenant to pay the\nrent when due is but one of the covenants the breach of which would give rise to a claim by the\nlessors for $150.00 per month for each and every month of the unexpired term of the lease.\n [1] Volumes have been written on the question of when a stipulated damage provision of a\ncontract should be enforced as liquidated damages and when enforcement **486 should be denied\nbecause it is a penalty provision. One line of cases, of which Eakin v. Scott, 70 Tex. 442, 7 S.W.\n777, is typical, states that the intention of the parties governs and another line states that their\nintention is immaterial, but when the results are examined there appears but little disparity between\nthem. All agree that to be enforceable as liquidated damages the damages must be uncertain and\nthe stipulation must be reasonable. There is a statement in the opinion in Eakin v. Scott, supra,\nwhich, standing alone, would lead to the conclusion that the damages in that case were certain\nin amount. But when the entire opinion is read, it becomes obvious that the damages were very\nuncertain in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was executed; and that is the true\ntest of uncertainty. The true theory is well expressed in Williston on Contracts, Revised Edition,\nSec. 779, p. 2192, in this language: ‘But as has been seen, the chief, almost the only, means of\ndetermining whether the parties in good faith endeavored to assess the damages is afforded by\nthe amount of damages stipulated for, and the nature of the breach upon which the stipulation\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   2\n\fStewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666 (1952)\n245 S.W.2d 484\n\nwas agreed to become operative. This is but saying in other words that the reasonableness or\nunreasonableness of the stipulation is decisive.’\n\n [2] The cases which hold that the intention of the parties controls impute to the parties an intention\nto provide for a penalty when it would be unreasonable and unjust to do otherwise, even though\ntheir language clearly expresses the contrary intention. They indulge in a presumption in order to\narrive at the justice of the case. The cases which disregard the intention of the parties treat the\nquestion as one of the legality of the stipulation. The reasoning in Langever v. R. G. Smith & Co.,\nTex.Com.App., 278 S.W. 178, 179, is typical of that employed in cases which announce that the\nintention of the parties controls. The statement in the opinion that ‘the real intention of the parties\nwhen ascertained will control’ is followed by the statement that such intention ‘is not necessarily\nascretained by the words *670 employed’. Regardless of which line of cases is followed, the\ncourts will not be bound by the language of the parties.\n\n [3] The right of competent parties to make their own bargains is not unlimited. The universal rule\nfor measuring damages for the breach of a contract is just compensation for the loss or damage\nactually sustained. By the operation of that rule a party generally should be awarded neither less\nnor more than his actual damages. A party has no right to have a court enforce a stipulation which\nviolates the principle underlying that rule. In those cases in which courts enforce stipulations of\nthe parties as a measure of damages for the breach of covenants, the principle of just compensation\nis not abandoned and another principle substituted therefor. What courts really do in those cases\nis to permit the parties to estimate in advance the amount of damages, provided they adhere to\nthe principle of just compensation. Restatement of Contracts, Sec. 339, accurately expresses the\nrule as follows:\n‘(1) An agreement, made in advance of breach fixing the damages therefor, is not enforceable as\na contract and does not affect the damages recoverable for the breach, unless\n\n‘(a) the amount so fixed is a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm that is caused\nby the breach, and\n\n‘(b) the harm that is caused by the breach is one that is incapable or very difficult of accurate\nestimation.’\n\n\n\nThis comment on subsection (1) follows: ‘b. Contracts are frequently made in which performance\nof very different degrees of importance and value are promised and one large sum of money\nis made payable as damages for any breach whatever. Since such a contract promises the same\nreparation for the breach of a trivial or comparatively unimportant stipulation as for the breach of\nthe most important one or of the whole contract, it is obvious that the parties have not adhered to\nthe rule of just compensation. In this matter neither the intention of the parties nor their expression\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    3\n\fStewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666 (1952)\n245 S.W.2d 484\n\nof intention is the governing consideration. The payment promised may be a penalty, though\ndescribed expressly as liquidated damages, and vice versa.’\n\n **487 The rule as declared in that comment is in effect the same as that declared in Williston\non Contracts, Revised Edition, Vol. 3, Sec. 783, p. 2204; McCormick on damages, Sec. 151; 15\nAm.Jur., Damages, Sec. 253; and 25 C.J.S., Damages, s *671 111. Early in the history of this\ncourt in Durst v. Swift, 11 Tex. 273, 282, the rule was stated in this language: ‘* * * where the\nagreement contains several matters of different degrees of importance, and yet the sum named is\npayable for the breach of any, even the least * * * the sum stipulated to be paid has been treated\nas a penalty.’ That rule was followed in Palestine Ice, Fuel & Gin Co. v. Walter Connally & Co.,\nTex.Civ.App., 148 S.W. 1109, error refused, and in Sanders Nursery Co. v. J. C. Engelman, Inc.,\nTex.Civ.App., 109 S.W.2d 1131, error dismissed.\n [4] When that rule is applied to the provisions in the contract before us it seems clear that\nthe stipulation should be construed as a provision for a penalty and not for liquidated damages.\nObviously, the stipulation was not carefully drawn. It provides that for the failure of lessee to\npay any installment of rent when due or for his breach of any other obligation of the contract, the\nlessors could, at their option, terminate the lease. Should they elect to terminate it, the lessee would\nbe obligated to pay them at that time a sum of money arrived at by multiplying $150.00 by the\nnumber of months of the unexpired term of the lease. Should they not elect to terminate the lease\nthey could, nevertheless, demand that amount in a lump sum on the date of the breach. The lease\ncontains several covenants other than the covenant to pay rent when due. One is a covenant of\nindemnity in this language: ‘Lessee further covenants and agrees to keep Lessors free and harmless\nfrom any and every claim, demand, or cause of action arising in or on the leased premises during\nthe term of this lease.’\n\n\nAnother is a covenant that lessee will prudently use the premises and avoid injuries thereto, except\nusual wear and tear, and another that lessee will ‘make such repairs as are not caused by Lessors\nor their agents and the usual depletion of said property.’\n\nIt is not necessary for us to decide whether petitioners would have been entitled to liquidated\ndamages had the lease contract contained no covenant except the covenant to pay rent, and we\ntherefore pass that question by without discussion. It is clear that petitioners should not be awarded\na large sum for liquidated damages for the breach of the other covenants just mentioned. Take,\nfor instance, the covenant for indemnity. Whatever amount respondent might have been called\nupon to pay petitioners as an indemnity would have been a *672 definite amount measured by\nthe liability theretofore adjudged against petitioners. An obligation to pay an indemnity is nothing\nmore than an obligation to pay a sum of money theretofore ascertained, and a provision that failure\nto pay a definite sum of money upon default of performance of a covenant in a contract entitles the\nobligee to recover liquidated damages in excess of the interest rate will not be enforced.

Basey, 150 Tex. 666 (1952)\n245 S.W.2d 484\n\n\nWith respect to the other covenants above mentioned, it was found by the trial court that respondent\nbreached them, and damages of $38.50 were assessed against him therefor. A stipulation to pay\nseveral thousand dollars for the breach of a covenant which might well result in damages of $38.50\nor even less would be so unreasonable that no court would lend its power to enforce it.\n\nOur conclusion is that, since the contract provided the same reparation for the breach of each\nand every covenant, and since it would be unreasonable and a violation of the principle of just\ncompensation to enforce it as to some of them, the provision for stipulated damages should be\ntreated as a penalty.\n\nWe approve the action of the Court of Civil Appeals on rehearing in remanding the case for the\npurpose of determining the actual damages instead of rendering it.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is affirmed.\n\nParallel Citations\n\n245 S.W.2d 484\n\nEnd of Document                                         © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

State Farm Lloyds, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 665 (2003)\n\n\n\narticles 5.06–1 and 5.06–3 of the Texas Insurance Code when it issued Taylor's business a multi-\nperil insurance policy with “hired and non-owned auto liability” coverage without providing\npersonal injury protection (“PIP”) or uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage (“UM/UIM”). See\nTex. Ins.Code Ann. arts. 5.06–1, –3 (West 1981). State Farm moved for summary judgment, and\nTaylor moved for partial summary judgment. The district court granted State Farm's motion, and\ndismissed Taylor's case. We affirm the summary judgment in favor of State Farm.\n\n\n\n                                                BACKGROUND\n\nTaylor purchased multi-peril insurance for her business from State Farm in 1993. At that\ntime, multi-peril insurance policies were promulgated by the Texas Department of Insurance\n(“TDI”). Within that policy, State Farm offered limited non-owned auto liability insurance. Taylor\npurchased hired auto liability insurance as an endorsement to her multi-peril policy. In 1996, TDI\nallowed State Farm to write its own multi-peril policy subject to TDI's approval. At that time, State\nFarm issued hired and non-owned auto liability insurance as an endorsement to Taylor's multi-\nperil policy. None of the hired and non-owned auto liability coverage State Farm issued included\nPIP or UM/UIM coverage. Taylor contends that State Farm was required to issue PIP and UM/\nUIM coverage by the Texas Insurance Code. State Farm rejoins that TDI has the authority to\nregulate certain auto insurance by other provisions of the insurance code when TDI determines\nthat it is appropriate. State Farm further asserts that TDI has chosen to regulate hired and non-\nowned auto coverage under the multi-peril subchapter of the insurance code rather than the auto\nliability subchapter, and therefore, PIP and UM/UIM coverages are not mandatory with regard\nto the hired and non-owned auto liability insurance that forms a limited part of the multi-peril\ninsurance Taylor purchased for her business.\n\n\n\n                                         STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n [1] [2] Because the propriety of a summary judgment is a question of law, we review the\ntrial court's decision de novo. *668 Natividad v. Alexsis, Inc., 875 S.W.2d 695, 699 (Tex.1994);\nTexas Dep't of Ins. v. American Home Assurance Co., 998 S.W.2d 344, 347 (Tex.App.-Austin\n1999, no pet.). The standards for reviewing a motion for summary judgment are well established:\n(1) the movant for summary judgment has the burden of showing that no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact exists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; (2) in deciding whether\nthere is a disputed material fact issue precluding summary judgment, evidence favorable to the\nnonmovant will be taken as true; and (3) every reasonable inference must be indulged in favor of\nthe nonmovant and any doubts resolved in its favor.

See Bradley v. State, 990 S.W.2d\n245, 247 (Tex.1999).\n\n\n\n                                                  DISCUSSION\n\nThe issue presented is whether PIP and UM/UIM coverage is mandatory when an endorsement for\nhired and non-owned auto liability is added to a business's multi-peril insurance policy. When the\ndistrict court granted State Farm's motion for summary judgment, it did not specify the grounds\nupon which it relied. Thus on appeal, Taylor argues that the district court erred in granting the\nsummary judgment by questioning every possible ground advanced. 1 Taylor asks: (1) Did she\nhave standing to seek declaratory relief?; (2) Did she have to exhaust administrative remedies\nbefore bringing suit?; (3) Is “hired and non-owned auto liability coverage” under this policy\nproperly classified as “automobile liability coverage” subject to mandatory PIP and UM/UIM\ncoverage?; (4) If “hired and non-owned auto liability coverage” is “automobile liability coverage,”\nmay TDI cancel or lessen coverage (PIP and UM/UIM) mandated by the legislature?; and (5) If\nTDI does have the authority to cancel or lessen mandated coverages, has it exercised any authority\nto do so?\n\n\nDoes the court have subject matter jurisdiction?\nBy Taylor's first issue she asks whether she has standing to bring this suit. We understand Taylor's\nquestion really to be whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction contingent on the “ripeness”\nof her suit. It is fairly clear that Taylor has standing—she is the appropriate person to bring the\naction. We will therefore address Taylor's jurisdictional question as to the “ripeness” of her suit.\nWe hold that her suit is ripe for consideration.\n\n [3] Taylor sought a declaratory judgment in district court to determine whether State Farm\nhad violated the Texas Insurance Code by issuing hired and non-owned auto liability insurance\nwithout providing PIP or UM/UIM coverage. The purpose of a declaratory judgment is “to settle\nand to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal\nrelations; and it is to be liberally construed and administered.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code\nAnn. § 37.002(b) (West 1997). However, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (“UDJA”)\ndoes not confer jurisdiction on a trial court but rather makes declaratory judgment available as a\nremedy for a *669 cause of action already within the court's jurisdiction. Chenault v. Phillips,\n914 S.W.2d 140, 141 (Tex.1996) (holding that mere request for declaratory judgment does not\nestablish jurisdiction); State v. Morales, 869 S.W.2d 941, 947 (Tex.1994); Texas Ass'n of Bus. v.\nTexas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex.1993). Thus, this Court must determine whether\nTaylor's request for declaratory relief is germane to a justiciable controversy already within the\ncourt's jurisdiction.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 3\n\fTaylor v. State Farm Lloyds, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 665 (2003)\n\n\n\n\n [4] A justiciable controversy need not be “a fully ripened cause of action.” Texas Dep't of Pub.\nSafety v. Moore, 985 S.W.2d 149, 153 (Tex.App.-Austin 1998, no pet.) (citing Ainsworth v. Oil\nCity Brass Works, 271 S.W.2d 754, 760 (Tex.Civ.App.-Beaumont 1954, no writ)). However, the\nfact situation must manifest the “ ‘ripening seeds of a controversy’ ... even though the differences\nbetween the parties as to their legal rights have not reached the state of an actual controversy.”\nAinsworth, 271 S.W.2d at 761, cited in Moore, 985 S.W.2d at 154. In other words, there must\neither be a pending cause of action between the parties or such a clear indication of the extent of\nthe parties' differences that a court may presume one is imminent.\n\n [5] In the present case, although Taylor has not filed a claim against State Farm on the hired and\nnon-owned auto liability coverage in her multi-peril policy, she asserts that State Farm has already\nviolated articles 5.06–1 and 5.06–3 of the insurance code by issuing automobile insurance without\nincluding PIP and UM/UIM coverage. See Tex. Ins.Code Ann. arts. 5.06–1, –3. The language of\nboth articles suggests that if Taylor's understanding of the insurance code is accurate (that hired and\nnon-owned auto liability coverage must be issued with PIP and UM/UIM coverage), State Farm\nhas indeed already violated the statute and has thereby infringed Taylor's legal rights. Whether\nState Farm was required to issue hired and non-owned automobile insurance with PIP and UM/\nUIM coverage is a question of law that may be appropriately decided by Taylor's invocation of\nthe UDJA. As such, Taylor's controversy is ripe for adjudication, and the court has subject matter\njurisdiction to hear her case.\n\n\nDid Taylor have to exhaust administrative remedies?\n [6] [7] In her second issue, Taylor asks whether she was required to exhaust any administrative\nremedies before bringing her suit in district court. Requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies\nis a well-established doctrine, but it has numerous exceptions. Taylor did not file a formal\ncomplaint with TDI. However, when pure questions of law are involved, the doctrine of exhaustion\nof administrative remedies does not apply. See Grounds v. Tolar Indep. Sch. Dist., 707 S.W.2d\n889, 892 (Tex.1986). In this case, the facts are undisputed and the question before the trial court\nis a pure question of law—whether hired and non-owned auto liability insurance must be issued\nwith PIP and UM/UIM coverage under the Texas Insurance Code. Concluding that Taylor did not\nneed to exhaust her administrative remedies prior to raising this issue of law before the trial court,\nwe agree that this could not form the basis for summary judgment.\n\n\nDid TDI have authority?\n [8] In her third and fourth issues, Taylor asks whether hired and non-owned auto liability\ninsurance is properly classified as “auto liability insurance” as contemplated by article 5,\nsubchapter A of the insurance code, and, if so, whether PIP and UM/UIM coverage must be issued\n *670 with hired and non-owned auto liability coverage. See Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 5 (West\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   4\n\fTaylor v. State Farm Lloyds, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 665 (2003)\n\n\n\n1981). We conclude that hired and non-owned auto liability insurance is distinguishable from\n“auto liability insurance” as contemplated by article 5, subchapter A of the insurance code, and\ntherefore State Farm need not provide PIP and UM/UIM coverage along with the hired and non-\nowned auto coverage in Taylor's multi-peril policy on her business.\n\n [9] [10] We begin our analysis with rules of statutory construction. Determining legislative\nintent is the overriding goal of statutory interpretation. Continental Cas. Co. v. Downs, 81 S.W.3d\n803, 805 (Tex.2002). In order to ascertain legislative intent, we first look to the plain and common\nmeaning of the words used by the legislature. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 311.011 (West 1998);\nKroger Co. v. Keng, 23 S.W.3d 347, 349 (Tex.2000); Tex. Workers' Comp. Comm'n v. Tex.\nBuilders Ins. Co., 994 S.W.2d 902, 908 (Tex.App.-Austin 1999, pet. denied). Unless a statute is\nambiguous, courts abide by the clear language of the statute and enforce it as written. RepublicBank\nDallas, N.A. v. Interkal, Inc., 691 S.W.2d 605, 607 (Tex.1985).\n\n [11] [12] [13] [14] Statutes are interpreted by considering the entire statute, not just disputed\nprovisions. Thomas v. Cornyn, 71 S.W.3d 473, 481 (Tex.App.-Austin 2002, no pet.). Disputed\nprovisions are to be considered in context, not in isolation. See Fitzgerald v. Advanced Spine\nFixation Sys., 996 S.W.2d 864, 866 (Tex.1999). Courts consider such things as the circumstances\nunder which the statute was enacted, former statutory provisions on the same or similar subjects,\nand the consequences of a particular construction when interpreting statutes. Keng, 23 S.W.3d at\n349. We do not give one provision an interpretation that is inconsistent with the other provisions\nof the act. Id.\n\nIn the case at hand, Taylor's assertion that State Farm was required to issue PIP and UM/\nUIM coverage with her hired and non-owned auto liability endorsement relies on the following\nprovisions of the insurance code:\n\n   No automobile liability insurance policy ... covering liability arising out of the ownership,\n   maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state\n   unless coverage is provided therein or supplemental thereto ... for the protection of persons\n   insured there under who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of\n   uninsured or underinsured motor vehicles....;\n\n   No automobile liability insurance policy ... covering liability arising out of the ownership,\n   maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state\n   unless personal injury protection is provided therein or supplemental thereto.\n\nTex.

State Farm Lloyds, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 665 (2003)\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, State Farm's conclusion that TDI has the authority to regulate certain auto\ninsurance under other subchapters of the insurance code relies upon the following provision—\nfound at the beginning of the subchapter dealing with automobile insurance:\n\n            There shall be excluded from regulation under the provisions of this subchapter\n            [subchapter A] any insurance against liability for damages arising out of the\n            ownership, operation, maintenance or use of or against loss of or damage to\n            motor vehicles ... which may, in the judgment of the Board, be a type or class of\n            insurance which is also the subject of or may be more properly regulated under\n            the terms or provisions of other insurance rating laws.... If such a *671 situation\n            shall be found to exist, the Board shall make an order declaring which of said\n            rating laws shall be applicable....\n\nId. at art. 5.02.\n\nTaking the provisions together and noting their relative placements within the subchapter dealing\nwith automobile insurance, it is clear that article 5.02 grants TDI the discretion to except some\nkinds of auto insurance from subchapter A's mandatory PIP and UM/UIM coverage.\n\nState Farm urges the Court to accept the Sidelnik decision as controlling the case before us. Sidelnik\nv. American States Ins. Co., 914 S.W.2d 689 (Tex.App.-Austin 1996, writ denied). In Sidelnik,\nan umbrella insurance policy was at issue. Any auto coverage encompassed within that umbrella\npolicy was excess to the primary insurance coverage the insured had to obtain before being issued\nthe umbrella policy. Id. The facts at hand do not exactly fit the Sidelnik scenario. Although it is\ntrue, as a practical matter, that in most cases hired and non-owned auto coverage operates much\nlike an excess policy—excess to the primary coverage owned by the user—there are situations in\nwhich the hired and non-owned auto policy could be the only, and thus primary, coverage. For\nthat reason, Sidelnik does not control the question presented regarding this multi-peril policy.\n\nNevertheless, TDI has unambiguous authority under article 5.02 to exclude some auto insurance\nfrom the requirements of subchapter A when in its judgment it is a type of insurance “more\nproperly regulated under the terms or provisions of other insurance rating laws.” Tex. Ins.Code\nAnn. art. 5.02. As discussed above, Taylor's hired and non-owned auto liability coverage was\nissued as an endorsement—a small part of her multi-peril business policy. Neither endorsement\nwas rated based on the risk characteristics of the car or driver. And in fact, Taylor only paid $3.07\nper $100 in anticipated annual rental expenses per year for her hired auto liability endorsement\nand approximately $4.00 a year for her non-owned auto liability endorsement. We reject Taylor's\nreading of articles 5.06–1 and 5.06–3 and overrule issues three and four.\n\n\nDid TDI exercise its authority?\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

State Farm Lloyds, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 665 (2003)\n\n\n\n [15] Having concluded that TDI does have the authority to remove hired and non-owned auto\nliability policies, such as Taylor's endorsement to a multi-peril policy, from the regulation of article\n5, subchapter A, we address Taylor's fifth issue, asking whether TDI has exercised the authority\nto classify a multi-peril policy with hired and non-owned auto liability coverage under a different\nsubchapter. We conclude that TDI has exercised its authority to do so.\n\nTaylor argues that in the event TDI wanted to except hired and non-owned auto liability from\nsubchapter A, it had to do so by an order that specifically invoked its authority to do so under\narticle 5.02. We disagree. In 1992, TDI ordered that garage insurance, “including all coverages\nand endorsements included in the Texas Garage Policy, except for those coverages specifically\nrated on the basis of risk characteristics of the automobile or person driving,” be regulated under\nthe multiperil subchapter of the insurance code. At that time, as well as today, hired auto liability\ninsurance was an endorsement under the Texas Garage Policy that was not specifically rated on the\nbasis of risk characteristics of the automobile or person driving. As for the limited non-owned auto\nliability insurance, it had been included within the Texas Business Owners Policy promulgated by\nTDI. The fact that TDI did not expressly state that it was using the discretion afforded it under\narticle 5.02 does *672 not render either order invalid. We overrule Taylor's fifth issue.\n\n\n\n                                                          CONCLUSION\n\nBecause the district court appropriately granted State Farm's summary judgment and properly\ndenied Taylor's partial summary judgment, we affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Grounds one and two would more properly be grounds for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction not summary judgment. We nevertheless\n       address these jurisdictional issues raised by appellant.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a bench trial, the trial court denied the relief sought by TAB, and as requested by the\nState and Intervenors, declared that section 4.041 of the Texas Clean Air Act, sections 26.136 and\n27.1015 of the Texas Water Code, and section 8b of the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act, as well\nas the rules and regulations promulgated under those statutes, are constitutional with regard to the\nopen courts and jury trial provisions. We affirm the trial court's judgment as it relates to TAB's\njury trial challenge and reverse its judgment as to TAB's open courts challenge.\n\nAn overview of the regulatory scheme enacted by the legislature and these agencies is essential to\nan understanding of this case. In 1967, the Texas Legislature enacted the Clean Air Act of Texas.\nClean Air Act of Texas, 60th Leg., R.S., ch. 727, 1967 Tex.Gen.Laws 1941. The Clean Air Act was\ndesigned to safeguard the state's air resources without compromising the economic development\nof the state. Id. at § 1. The Act created the Texas Air Control Board and granted it the authority\nto promulgate regulations to accomplish the Act's goals. Id. at § 4(A)(2)(a). In the event the Air\nControl Board determined that a violation of its regulations had occurred, it was authorized to\nenforce those regulations in district court. Upon a judicial determination that a violation of the\nAir Control Board's regulations had occurred, two cumulative remedies were available, injunctive\nrelief to prohibit further violations and assessment of a fine ranging from $50 to $1,000 for each\nday the violations persisted. Id. at § 12(B).\n\nIn 1969, the Texas Legislature enacted the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Solid Waste Disposal Act,\n61st Leg., R.S., ch. 405, 1969 Tex.Gen.Laws 1320. The express purpose for this legislation was\nto protect public health and welfare by regulating the “collection, handling, storage, and disposal\nof solid waste.” Id. at § 1. The Texas Water Quality Board was designated the primary agency to\neffectuate the Disposal Act's purpose. Id. at § 4(f). Like the Air Control Board, the Water Quality\nBoard was authorized to enforce its rules and regulations in state district court. The Solid Waste\nDisposal Act provided the same remedies as the Clean Air Act. See id. at § 8(c).\n\nIn the last of the relevant statutory enactments, in 1969, the Texas Legislature promulgated a\nrevised version of the Water Quality Act. Water Quality Act—Revision, 61st Leg., R.S., ch. 760,\n1969 Tex.Gen.Laws 2229. By that Act, the Water Quality Board was given the power to develop\na statewide water quality plan, to perform research and investigations, and to adopt rules and\nissue orders necessary to effectuate the Act's purposes. Id. at § 3.01–3.10. The Water Quality Act\nprovided the same remedies as the Solid Waste Management Act and the Clean Air Act. See id.\nat § 4.02.\n\nOriginally, neither the Water Quality Board nor the Air Control Board had the power to levy civil\npenalties directly in the event it determined that its regulations or orders had been violated. Instead,\neach board was required first to file suit against the violator in district court. Only the district court\nhad the power to assess civil penalties.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\nThe legislature substantially changed this enforcement scheme in 1985. That year the Air Control\nBoard and the Water Commission (formerly the Water Control Board) were granted the power\nto assess civil penalties directly of up to $10,000 per day per violation. 2 Both administrative\nbodies also retained the option to pursue civil penalties in district court. *443 TEX.HEALTH\n& SAFETY CODE §§ 361.224, 382.081; TEX.WATER CODE § 26.123. This was the regulatory\nscheme in effect when the district court rendered judgment in this case. 3\n\nAfter the Air Control Board or Water Commission assesses a penalty, the offender must either\ntimely pay the penalty or file suit in district court. However, a supersedeas bond or cash deposit\npaid into an escrow account, in the full amount of the penalty, is a prerequisite to judicial review.\nTEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 382.089(a), (b), 361.252(k), (l ); TEX.WATER CODE\n§ 26.136(j). A party who fails to make a cash deposit or file a bond forfeits all rights to judicial\nreview. TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 361.252(m), 382.089(c); TEX.WATER CODE §\n26.136(k).\n\nTAB alleges that it is a Texas not-for-profit corporation, that its members do business throughout\nTexas, and that it is authorized to represent its members on any matter that may have an impact\non their businesses.\n\nTAB filed this suit under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, TEX.CIV.PRAC. &\nREM.CODE §§ 37.001–37.011, alleging that some of its members had been subjected to civil\npenalties assessed by either the Air Control Board or the Water Commission. TAB further alleged\nthat all of its other members that operate their businesses pursuant to the pertinent provisions of\nthe Texas Clean Air Act, the Texas Water Code, or the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act or any\nrules or orders issued pursuant to those provisions were put at “substantial risk (if not certainty)”\nof being assessed civil penalties by the Air Control Board or the Water Commission. Thus this\nsuit does not challenge specific instances of the Air Control Board's or the Water Commission's\nexercise, or threatened exercise, of the civil penalty power. Instead, TAB's suit is a facial challenge\nto the constitutionality of this administrative enforcement scheme under the Texas Constitution.\n\nThe Defendants and Intervenors counterclaimed seeking a declaratory judgment that the statutes,\nrules, and regulations challenged by TAB do not, on their face, conflict with the open courts and\njury trial provisions of our constitution. The trial court granted the Defendants' and Intervenors'\nrequested declaratory judgment and denied TAB's request for a declaratory judgment. The court\nalso denied TAB's request for injunctive relief.\n\nTAB appealed directly to this court. See TEX.GOV'T CODE § 22.001(c); 4 TEX.R.APP.P. 140.\nIn this court, TAB has limited its challenges to claims of unconstitutional denial of a jury trial and\nviolation of our constitution's open courts provision.\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Standing\n\nBefore we reach the merits of this case, we first consider the matter of the trial court's jurisdiction,\nas well as our own; specifically we determine whether TAB has standing to challenge the statutes\nand regulations in question. Because TAB's standing to bring this action is not readily apparent,\nand because our jurisdiction as well as that of the trial court depends on this issue, we requested\nsupplemental briefing on standing at the oral argument of this case. In response, the parties insist\nthat any question of standing has been waived in the trial court and cannot be raised by the court\nfor the first time on appeal. We disagree.\n\n [1] Subject matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to decide a case. Standing\nis implicit in the concept of subject matter jurisdiction. The standing requirement stems from two\nlimitations on subject matter jurisdiction: the separation of powers doctrine and, in Texas, the open\ncourts provision. Subject matter jurisdiction *444 is never presumed and cannot be waived. 5\n\n [2] [3] One limit on courts' jurisdiction under both the state and federal constitutions is the\nseparation of powers doctrine. See TEX.CONST. art. II, § 1; Valley Forge Christian College v.\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State, 454 U.S. 464, 471–74, 102 S.Ct. 752, 757–\n60, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2204, 45 L.Ed.2d\n343 (1975); see also, Antonin Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential Element of the\nSeparation of Powers, 18 SUFFOLK U.L.Rev. 881, 889 n. 69 (1983) (noting that the dicta of\nFlast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 100, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1952, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), suggesting that\nstanding is unrelated to the separation of powers doctrine has since been disavowed). Under this\ndoctrine, governmental authority vested in one department of government cannot be exercised by\nanother department unless expressly permitted by the constitution. Thus we have construed our\nseparation of powers article to prohibit courts from issuing advisory opinions because such is the\nfunction of the executive rather than the judicial department. 6 Firemen's Ins. Co. v. Burch, 442\nS.W.2d 331, 333 (Tex.1969); Morrow v. Corbin, 122 Tex. 553, 62 S.W.2d 641, 644 (Tex.1933).\nAccordingly, we have interpreted the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, TEX.CIV.PRAC. &\nREM.CODE §§ 37.001–.011, to be merely a procedural device for deciding cases already within a\ncourt's jurisdiction rather than a legislative enlargement of a court's power, permitting the rendition\nof advisory opinions.

Puretex Lemon Juice, Inc., 160 Tex.\n586, 334 S.W.2d 780 (1960).\n\n[4] [5] The distinctive feature of an advisory opinion is that it decides an abstract question of law\nwithout binding the parties. Alabama State Fed'n of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U.S. 450, 461, 65 S.Ct.\n1384, 1389, 89 L.Ed. 1725 (1945); Firemen's Ins.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nInc., 160 Tex. at 591, 334 S.W.2d at 783. An opinion issued in a case brought by a party without\nstanding is advisory because rather than remedying an actual or imminent harm, the judgment\naddresses only a hypothetical injury. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315,\n3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). Texas courts, like federal courts, have no jurisdiction to render such\nopinions.\n\n [6] The separation of powers doctrine is not the only constitutional basis for standing. Under\nfederal law, standing is also an aspect of the Article III limitation of the judicial power to “cases”\nand “controversies.” Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 731, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1364, 31 L.Ed.2d\n636 (1972). To comport with Article III, a federal court may hear a case only when the litigant has\nbeen threatened with or has sustained an injury. Valley Forge Christian College, 454 U.S. at 471,\n102 S.Ct. at 758. Under the Texas Constitution, standing is implicit in the open courts provision,\nwhich contemplates access to the courts only for those litigants suffering an injury. Specifically,\nthe open courts provision provides:\n\n            All courts shall be open, and every person for an injury done him, in his lands,\n            goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law.\n\nTEX. CONST. art. I, § 13 (emphasis added). Because standing is a constitutional prerequisite to\nmaintaining a suit under both federal and Texas law, we look to the more extensive jurisprudential\nexperience of the federal courts on this subject for any guidance it may yield.\n\nUnder federal law, a lack of standing deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction because\nstanding is an element of such *445 jurisdiction.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\n [7] Subject matter jurisdiction is an issue that may be raised for the first time on appeal; it\nmay not be waived by the parties. Texas Employment Comm'n v. International Union of Elec.,\nRadio and Mach. Workers, Local Union No. 782, 163 Tex. 135, 352 S.W.2d 252, 253 (1961);\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS § 11, comment c (1982). This court recently\nreiterated that axiom in Gorman v. Life Insurance Co., 811 S.W.2d 542, 547 (Tex.), cert. denied,\n502 U.S. 824, 112 S.Ct. 88, 116 L.Ed.2d 60 (1991). Because we conclude that standing is a\ncomponent of subject matter jurisdiction, it cannot be waived and may be raised for the first time\non appeal. 8\n\n [8] If we were to conclude that standing is unreviewable on appeal at least three undesirable\nconsequences could result. First and foremost, appellate courts would be impotent to prevent lower\ncourts from exceeding their constitutional and statutory limits of authority. Second, appellate\ncourts could not arrest collusive suits. Third, by operation of the doctrines of res judicata and\ncollateral estoppel, judgments rendered in suits addressing only hypothetical injuries could bar\nrelitigation of issues by a litigant who eventually suffers an actual injury. We therefore hold that\nstanding, as a component of subject matter *446 jurisdiction, cannot be waived in this or any\nother case and may be raised for the first time on appeal by the parties or by the court.\n\nWe are aware that this holding conflicts with Texas Industrial Traffic League v. Railroad\nCommission, 633 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex.1982) (per curiam). 9 The analysis that leads us to the\nconclusion we reach here, however, compels us to overrule Texas Industrial Traffic League and\ndisapprove of all cases relying on it to the extent that they conflict with this opinion. 10 Although\nour concern for the rule of stare decisis makes us hesitant to overrule any case, when constitutional\nprinciples are at issue this court as a practical matter is the only government institution with the\npower and duty to correct such errors. See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, –––– – ––––, 111\nS.Ct. 2597, 2609–11, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991) (observing that reexamination of constitutional\ndecisions is appropriate when “correction through legislative action is practically impossible”).\n\nConsequently, we proceed to determine here, on our own motion, whether TAB has standing to\nbring this suit.\n\n [9] [10] Because standing is a component of subject matter jurisdiction, we consider TAB's\nstanding under the same standard by which we review subject matter jurisdiction generally. That\nstandard requires the pleader to allege facts that affirmatively demonstrate the court's jurisdiction\nto hear the cause. Richardson v. First Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 419 S.W.2d 836, 839 (Tex.1967). When\nreviewing a trial court order dismissing a cause for want of jurisdiction, Texas appellate courts\n“construe the pleadings in favor of the plaintiff and look to the pleader's intent.” Huston v. Federal\nDeposit Ins. Corp., 663 S.W.2d 126, 129 (Tex.App.—Eastland 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e. 1984); see\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Wendell Hall, Standards of Appellate Review in Civil Appeals, 21 ST. MARY'S L.J. 865,\n870 (1990).\n\n [11] Here, however, we are not reviewing a trial court order of dismissal for want of jurisdiction,\nwe are considering standing for the first time on appeal. A review of only the pleadings to\ndetermine subject matter jurisdiction is sufficient in the trial court because a litigant has a right to\namend to attempt to cure pleading defects if jurisdictional facts are not alleged. See TEX.R.CIV.P.\n80. Failing that, the suit is dismissed. When an appellate court questions jurisdiction on appeal\nfor the first time, however, there is no opportunity to cure the defect. Therefore, when a Texas\nappellate court reviews the standing of a party sua sponte, it must construe the petition in favor of\nthe party, and if necessary, review the entire record to determine if any evidence supports standing.\n\n [12] TAB asserts standing on behalf of its members. The general test for standing in Texas\nrequires that there “(a) shall be a real controversy between the parties, which (b) will be actually\ndetermined by the judicial declaration sought.” Board of Water Engineers v. City of San Antonio,\n155 Tex. 111, 114, 283 S.W.2d 722, 724 (1955). Texas, however, has no particular test for\ndetermining the standing of an organization, such as TAB. See e.g., *447 Touchy v. Houston\nLegal Found., 432 S.W.2d 690, 694 (Tex.1968); Texas Highway Comm'n v. Texas Ass'n of Steel\nImporters, Inc., 372 S.W.2d 525, 530–31 (Tex.1963). While we agree with the statement of the\ngeneral test for standing set out in Board of Water Engineers, we foresee difficulties in relying on\nit alone to determine the standing of an organization like TAB. For instance, when members of an\norganization have individual standing, but the organization was not established for the purpose of\nprotecting the particular interest at issue, it is not necessarily in the members' best interest to allow\nsuch a disinterested organization to sue on their behalf. Furthermore, an organization should not\nbe allowed to sue on behalf of its members when the claim asserted requires the participation of\nthe members individually rather than as an association, such as when the members seek to recover\nmoney damages and the amount of damages varies with each member.\n\n [13] The United States Supreme Court has articulated a standard for associational standing that\nlends itself to our use. We adopt that test today. In Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising\nCommission, the Court held that an association has standing to sue on behalf of its members when\n“(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks\nto protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the\nrelief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” 432 U.S. 333,\n343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977); see also New York State Club Ass'n v. City of\nNew York, 487 U.S. 1, 9, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 2231, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988); International Union, United\nAuto., Aerospace and Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 282, 106 S.Ct.\n2523, 2528, 91 L.Ed.2d 228 (1986). This standard incorporates the standing analysis we adopted\nin Board of Water Engineers, yet addresses the additional concerns we have noted.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    7\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n [14] We now apply the Hunt standard to the case before us. Reviewing the record in its entirety\nfor evidence supporting subject matter jurisdiction, and resolving any doubt in TAB's favor, we\nconclude that TAB has standing to pursue the relief it seeks in this case.\n\nThe first prong of the Hunt test requires that TAB's pleadings and the rest of the record demonstrate\nthat TAB's members have standing to sue in their own behalf. This requirement should not be\ninterpreted to impose unreasonable obstacles to associational representation. In this regard the\nUnited States Supreme Court stated that “the purpose of the first part of the Hunt test is simply to\nweed out plaintiffs who try to bring cases, which could not otherwise be brought, by manufacturing\nallegations of standing that lack any real foundation.” New York State Club Ass'n, 487 U.S. at 9,\n108 S.Ct. at 2232. We are satisfied that TAB has not manufactured this lawsuit. A comparison of\nthe association's membership roster with the list of businesses subjected to state penalties indicates\nindividual TAB members have been assessed administrative penalties pursuant to the challenged\nenactments. Additionally, TAB has alleged that other of its members remain at substantial risk of\npenalty. A substantial risk of injury is sufficient under Hunt. See e.g., Pennell v. City of San Jose,\n485 U.S. 1, 7 n. 3, 108 S.Ct. 849, 855 n. 3, 99 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988) (concluding that association of\nlandlords had standing based on pleadings that individual members would likely be harmed by\nrent ordinance). Thus TAB satisfies the first prong of the Hunt test.\n\nThe second prong of Hunt requires that TAB's pleadings and the rest of the record demonstrate\nthat the interests TAB seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose. TAB was\nchartered to “represent the interests of its members on issues which may impact upon its members'\nbusinesses.” Considering a very similar question in New York State Club Association, the United\nStates Supreme Court held that: “[T]he associational interests that the consortium seeks to protect\nare germane to its purpose: appellant's certificate of incorporation states that its purpose is ‘to\npromote the common business interests of its *448 [member clubs].’ ” 487 U.S. at 10 n. 4, 108\nS.Ct. at 2232, n. 4 (bracketed language in original). Likewise, the interests TAB desires to protect\nare germane to the organization's purpose, and thus the second prong is met.\n\nUnder the third and final prong of the Hunt test, TAB's pleadings and the record must demonstrate\nthat neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested require the participation of individual\nmembers in the lawsuit. The Supreme Court has interpreted this prong as follows:\n\n            [W]hether an association has standing to invoke the court's remedial powers on\n            behalf of its members depends in substantial measure on the nature of the relief\n            sought. If in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, injunction, or\n            some other form of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supposed that the\n            remedy, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those members of the association\n            actually injured.\n\nHunt, 432 U.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441 (quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at 515, 95 S.Ct. at 2213).\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\nBy seeking damages on behalf of its members, necessitating that each individual prove lost profits\nparticular to its operations, the organization in Warth lacked standing to sue; rather, each individual\nmember had to be a party to the suit. These facts are distinguishable from Brock, in which the\nunion challenged an administrative interpretation of statutory provisions relating to unemployment\ncompensation. 477 U.S. 274, 106 S.Ct. 2523. Recognizing that the suit raised “a pure question of\nlaw,” and that “the individual circumstances” of any aggrieved member were not in issue, the Court\nheld that the UAW had standing to challenge the government's actions. Id. at 287–88, 290, 106\nS.Ct. at 2531–32, 2533; see also Pennell, 485 U.S. at 7 n. 3, 108 S.Ct. at 855 n. 3 (facial challenge\nto rent ordinance does not require participation of individual landlords). Here, TAB seeks only\nprospective relief, raises only issues of law, and need not prove the individual circumstances of\nits members to obtain that relief, thus meeting the third prong of Hunt.\n\nHaving found that TAB meets all three prongs of the Hunt test, we conclude that TAB has standing\nto pursue the relief it seeks in this case.\n\n\n\n                                                II. Open Courts\n\nTAB contends that the forfeiture provisions of the statutes and regulations in question violate the\nopen courts provision of the Texas Constitution by unreasonably restricting access to the courts.\nAfter the agency has found a party to be in violation of any of these statutes and regulations, the\noffender must either tender a cash deposit or post a supersedeas bond in the full amount of the\npenalties assessed, or forfeit the right to judicial review. 11\n\nHistorically, we have recognized at least three separate constitutional guarantees emanating\nfrom our open courts provision. First, courts must actually be open and operating, so that, for\nexample, the legislature must place every county within a judicial district. Runge & Co. v.\nWyatt, 25 Tex.Supp. 294 (1860). Second, citizens must have access to those courts unimpeded by\nunreasonable financial barriers, so that the legislature cannot impose a litigation tax in the form\nof increased filing fees to enhance the state's general revenue, LeCroy v. Hanlon, 713 S.W.2d\n335, 342 (Tex.1986). Finally, meaningful legal remedies must be afforded to our citizens, so\nthat the legislature may not abrogate the right to assert a well-established common law cause of\naction unless the reason for its action outweighs the litigants' constitutional right of redress. Sax\nv. Votteler, 648 S.W.2d 661, 665–66 (Tex.1983).\n\n[15] Here the second guarantee is applicable. This is not a question of the abrogation of any\nwell-established common law *449 cause of action, 12 just as it is not a question of the physical\nabsence of a court to which a complaint may be brought. The issue before us is access to the\ncourts. In previous cases involving this issue, we did not predicate our decision on whether the\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    9\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nparty whose access had been restricted was attempting to assert a common law cause of action. In\nLeCroy, for example, the court did not permit increased filing fees for statutory causes of action\nwhile denying them for common law claims. 713 S.W.2d 335. Likewise in Dillingham v. Putnam,\nwhen the court struck down a statute requiring a supersedeas bond as a condition of appeal, the\ncourt did not concern itself with whether the particular appeal being restricted involved a common\nlaw or statutory claim. 109 Tex. 1, 14 S.W. 303 (1890). Similarly, in the present case, the issue is\nsimply whether the prepayment requirement is an unreasonable financial barrier to access to the\ncourts in light of the state interest involved.\n\nThe stated purpose of the regulatory statutes at issue here is to protect our state's natural\nresources. 13 There is no question that this is an important state interest. 14 The state argues that\nthe prepayment provisions further this interest by increasing the deterrent effect of the penalties\nand by aiding in their collection. The state maintains that a violator will be less deterred by an\nadministrative penalty if it can delay payment without bond while appealing the case in the courts.\nThe state also argues that delay may render the penalty uncollectible, as the violator may become\ninsolvent.\n\nIn considering these rationales, we note that the prepayment provisions actually consist of two\nelements. First, the assessed penalty must be paid, or financial security provided, within thirty\ndays; enforcement is not stayed pending any period of judicial review. 15 Second, if payment is\nnot made or financial security provided within the thirty-day period, the right to judicial review\nis forfeited. We agree that the rationales advanced by the state justify the first of these elements.\nRequiring expeditious payment of the administrative penalties increases their effectiveness. The\nlegislature, however, could have imposed the first element without the second. It could have\nprovided the agency with the right to collection of assessed penalties unless a supersedeas bond\nis posted, yet provided for judicial review. The requirement of immediate payment, without the\ncorresponding forfeiture provision, would not have implicated the open courts provision, as the\ncharged party could have obtained judicial review regardless of payment. This approach would\nhave been in accordance with the usual procedure governing appeals of trial court judgments.\nSee TEX.R.APP.P. 40. Any litigant may appeal without superseding the trial court's judgment,\nbut the mere pendency of an appeal does not stay enforcement of the judgment. 16 *450 Our\nspecific focus for purposes of our open courts analysis, therefore, is not whether the requirement\nof immediate payment is reasonable, but whether the forfeiture of the right of judicial review, if\nthe penalties are not superseded, is reasonable.\n\nWe conclude that the forfeiture provision is an unreasonable restriction on access to the courts.\nWhile the requirement of prepayment or the posting of a bond to stay enforcement furthers the\nstate's important environmental interests by creating a strong incentive for timely payment of\nthe assessed penalties, the forfeiture provision serves no additional interest. 17 The state may\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\naccomplish its goals by enforcing the prepayment requirements without infringing on a party's\nright to its day in court. Accordingly, we hold that forfeiture sections of the statutes and regulations\nat issue facially violate our open courts provision. 18\n\n\n\n                                                 III. Jury Trial\n\nTAB also claims that the statutes empowering these agencies to assess civil penalties violate the\nright to a jury trial guaranteed by the Texas Constitution. 19 We disagree.\n\nArticle I, section 15 of our constitution 20 preserves a right to trial by jury for those actions, or\nanalogous actions, tried to a jury at the time the constitution of 1876 was adopted. E.g., State v.\nCredit Bureau of Laredo, 530 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex.1975); White v. White, 108 Tex. 570, 196\nS.W. 508 (1917); Hatten v. City of Houston, 373 S.W.2d 525 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston 1963, writ\nref'd n.r.e.); Hickman v. Smith, 238 S.W.2d 838 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1951, writ ref'd). A jury\ntrial is not mandated by this provision for any other judicial proceeding. Id.\n\n [16] In Credit Bureau, we concluded that a suit for civil penalties for violation of an injunction\nissued pursuant to the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act was analogous to the common law\naction for debt, tried to a jury at the time our constitution was adopted. 530 S.W.2d at 293.\nThus, we held that the right to a jury trial for that action remained inviolate. Id. We observed\nin Credit Bureau, however, that in certain types of adversary proceedings the constitutional\nright to a jury trial does not attach. Among the proceedings we referred to are appeals from\nadministrative decisions. 21 Id. (citing State v. De Silva, 105 Tex. 95, 145 S.W. 330 (1912),\nand *451 Texas Liquor Control Bd. v. Jones, 112 S.W.2d 227 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston 1937,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.)). Consistent with this noted exception in Credit Bureau, we conclude that these\nagencies' assessments of environmental penalties are not actions, or analogous actions, to those\ntried to a jury at the time the constitution of 1876 was adopted. To hold that these environmental\nstatutes and regulations promulgated in the late 1960s merely parrot common law and statutory\nrights triable to a jury in 1876 would turn a blind eye to the emergence of the modern administrative\nstate and its profound impact on our legal and social order. In the late 19th century, ours was\nprimarily a sparsely-populated agrarian society. See generally, T.R. Fehrenbach, Lone Star: A\nHistory of Texas and the Texans, 279–324 (1983). By contrast, concentrated industrial activity and\nits by-products, including the wide-spread emission of pollutants, with their resulting potential for\nsignificant damage to our natural resources are phenomena of relatively recent origin. In response\nto such phenomena, regulatory schemes, such as those challenged here, were designed to balance\nmounting environmental concerns with our state's economic vitality. In 1876 no governmental\nschemes akin to these existed. 22 Thus, we conclude that the contested proceedings are not\nanalogous to any action tried to a jury in 1876. Accordingly, we hold that no right to a jury\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   11\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\ntrial attaches to appeals from administrative adjudications under the environmental statutes and\nregulations at issue here. 23\n\nWe should not be misunderstood to say that the legislature may abrogate the right to trial by\njury in any case by delegating duties to an administrative agency. Here, we simply reaffirm what\nthis court held almost a half century ago, in Corzelius v. Harrell, 143 Tex. 509, 186 S.W.2d\n961 (1945). In Corzelius, we concluded that certain judicial functions, including fact finding,\nmay be delegated constitutionally by the legislature to administrative agencies in furtherance of\nthe preservation and conservation of the state's natural resources. The decision in Corzelius was\nbased on article XVI, section 59(a) of our constitution, which provides in relevant part: “The\nconservation and development of all the natural resources of this State ... and the preservation and\nconservation of all such natural resources ... are each and all ... public rights and duties; and the\nLegislature shall pass all such laws as may be appropriate thereto.” TEX. CONST. art. XVI, §\n59(a). “By the use of the broad language used in Article XVI, Section 59(a),” the court stated, “the\nLegislature is authorized to enact such laws as are necessary to carry out the purposes for which\nsuch constitutional amendment was adopted.” Corzelius, 186 S.W.2d at 964. 24\n\n [17] There is no doubt that the legislature delegated the power to assess these civil penalties\nto the Air Control Board and the Water Commission as a manifestation of the public's interest\nin preserving and conserving the state's air and water resources. That intent is apparent from the\npolicy statements of the relevant statutes. 25 *452 We conclude, therefore, that the delegation of\nthe fact-finding function by the legislature to the Air Control Board and the Water Commission\nunder this statutory scheme was within the legislature's constitutional authority.\n\nOf course, the fact that no jury trial is provided by the legislature to an alleged violator of these\nenvironmental protection laws does not mean that the agencies' power to assess penalties is\nunbridled. 26 The Air Control Board and the Water Commission may act only within constitutional\nand statutory parameters.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, we reverse that portion of the trial court's judgment declaring that\nsection 4.041 of the Texas Clean Air Act, sections 26.136 and 27.1015 of the Texas Water Code,\nand section 8b of the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act and the rules and regulations promulgated\nunder those statutes comport with the open courts provision of our constitution, article I, section 13.\nWe declare that the requirement of a supersedeas bond or cash deposit paid into an escrow account\nas a prerequisite to judicial review under TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 361.252(m)\n(first clause), 382.089(c) (first sentence), and TEX.WATER CODE § 26.136(k) (first sentence)\nis unconstitutional. We affirm that portion of the trial court's judgment declaring that the listed\nstatutes, rules, and regulations do not violate the jury trial provision of our constitution, article\nI, section 15.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

If the mess is\nbig enough, if the stench is strong enough, no matter how great the danger to public health and\nsafety, an industrial litterer can “mess” with Texas without fear of immediate punishment or legally\neffective citizen action.\n\nAnd what an occasion for permitting polluters to “mess” with Texas air and water.

I dissent from today's manipulation of the law to paralyze anti-\npollution efforts, tragically announced at a time when protecting the quality of the air we breathe\nand the water we drink is so critical.\n\nToday's opinion delivers a double whammy to protection of our natural resources.

The constitutional right of trial by jury, already\nsuffering at the hands of this majority, is no longer inviolate; it may be abrogated at any time.\nInstead of walking into a courthouse, where a jury is guaranteed, citizens may be detoured to\nan administrative agency, to explain their problems to bureaucrats not directly answerable to the\ncommunity.\n\nToday precedent and tradition have been trampled as the majority's long-standing fear of ordinary\npeople in our legal system has taken firm hold. The drafters of our Texas Constitution realized\nsomething that the majority has long ceased to appreciate—ordinary Texans can make an\nextraordinary contribution to our system of justice. The more their collective voice expressed in\na jury verdict is disregarded, the more new barriers are contrived to shut them out of our system\nof justice, the less justice that system will offer.\n\n\n\n                                                I. Open Courts\n\nThe ability of state agencies to enforce environmental laws through the assessment of\nadministrative penalties is declared unconstitutional by the majority as contradicting our state\nguarantee of open courts. While concluding that TAB certainly has a right to judicial review on\nbehalf of its members, I disagree that the statutory restrictions it challenges unreasonably restrict\naccess to the courts.\n\nAccess to the courts is unquestionably a fundamental constitutional and common law right. Article\nI, section 13 of the Texas Constitution forms the nucleus of this protection:\n\n             *454 The open courts provision specifically guarantees all litigants the right to\n            redress their grievances—to use a popular and correct phrase, the right to their\n            day in court. This right is a substantial state constitutional right.\n\nLeCroy v. Hanlon, 713 S.W.2d 335, 341 (Tex.1986) (citations omitted). This court has a long\nhistory of assuring that the right of access remains guaranteed to Texas citizens. 3\n\nIn Sax v. Votteler, 648 S.W.2d 661 (Tex.1983), we required a litigant alleging an unconstitutional\ndenial of access to the courts to show that: (1) a cognizable common law cause of action is being\nrestricted and (2) the limitation is unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced against the purpose\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The majority today appropriately eliminates the first showing in certain\ncases. In some circumstances the distinction between common law and statutory causes of action\nclearly does not affect whether access to the courts has been denied.\n\nThe second part of the Sax test, however, continues to be applied in all open courts cases. 4 Thus,\nin determining whether the open courts provision of the Texas Constitution is violated by the\nrequirement that administrative penalties be paid as a prerequisite to judicial review, we must\nbalance two competing interests: the right of TAB's members to access to the courts and the state's\nconcern with effective and timely enforcement of its laws protecting the environment. The majority\ntoday restates in rather vague terms this second prong: “whether the prepayment requirement is\nan unreasonable financial barrier to access to the courts in light of the state interest involved.” 852\nS.W.2d at 449. As we held in LeCroy:\n\n\n   Because a substantial right is involved, the legislature cannot arbitrarily or unreasonably\n   interfere with a litigant's right of access to the courts. Thus, the general open courts provision\n   test balances the legislature's actual purpose in enacting the law against that law's interference\n   with the individual's right of access to the courts. The government has the burden to show that\n   the legislative purpose outweighs the interference with the individual's right of access.\n   713 S.W.2d at 341 (citations omitted; emphasis supplied).\nApplying this test, we have permitted certain restrictions on access to the courts, while disallowing\nothers. Compare LeCroy, 713 S.W.2d at 341 (court filing fee unreasonably restricts access to\njudicial system), and Dillingham v. Putnam, 109 Tex. 1, 14 S.W. 303 (1890) (supersedeas bond\nas prerequisite to appeal, without regard to ability to pay, unconstitutional), with Clanton v.\nClark, 639 S.W.2d 929 (Tex.1982) (court may constitutionally dismiss suit for failure to timely\nfile cost bond), and Federal Crude Oil Co. v. Yount–Lee Oil Co., 122 Tex. 21, 52 S.W.2d 56\n(1932) (requirement that franchise taxes be paid prior to filing suit upheld under article I, § 13);\ncompare Lucas v. United States, 757 S.W.2d 687 (Tex.1988) (limitations on damages for medical\nmalpractice unconstitutional), with Rose v. Doctors Hosp., 801 S.W.2d 841 (Tex.1990) (same\nlimitations upheld under open courts provision in wrongful death cases). I favor a more complete\nand predictable open courts analysis designed to discourage such anomalous results.\n\n *455 Today's implementation of the second prong of the Sax test demonstrates its malleability.\nAfter perfunctorily reciting the purpose of administrative penalties, the majority, without any\nfurther analysis, concludes that: “the forfeiture provision is an unreasonable restriction on access to\nthe courts,” 852 S.W.2d at 450, and “the forfeiture provision serves no additional [state] interest.”\nId. at 450. Enacted by the Legislature as an important means of enforcing our state's environmental\nlaws, these penalties are today judicially extinguished. The majority determines that these laudable\nlegislative objectives are not sufficiently “important” to justify the possibility that the use of\npenalties may perhaps someday impose some slight financial strain on some hypothetical polluter.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\nWhether examined under either the vague test employed today or my more exacting formulation,\nthe majority's conclusory analysis suffers from at least three major flaws: (1) a failure to recognize\nthe compelling interest, grounded in our state constitution, served by administrative penalties,\nincluding prepayment provisions; (2) a disregard of the extensive statutory constraints on penalty\nusage which represents the least restrictive means to achieve this purpose; and (3) an assumption\nthat the prepayment provision interferes with individual access to the courts unsupported by even\na single specific instance of such a restrictive effect.\n\nThe balancing required by Sax mandates careful consideration of the rights being affected. The\nmore significant the right the litigant asserts, the more onerous the government's burden becomes.\nTAB has asserted a right to judicial review of penalties imposed against its members. This interest\nis encompassed within the right of access to the courts, which we declared a “substantial state\nconstitutional right.” LeCroy, 713 S.W.2d at 341.\n\nThe State has met its burden by demonstrating a compelling interest in employing administrative\npenalties reflected in constitutionally-guaranteed protection of our state's natural resources.\nAlthough not critical in overcoming an open courts challenge, a constitutional predicate for the\nstate's interest is a highly persuasive factor in the balancing process. As declared in article XVI,\nsection 59(a) 5 :\n\n\n  [T]he preservation and conservation of all ... natural resources of the State are each and all\n  declared public rights and duties; and the Legislature shall pass all laws as may be appropriate\n  thereto.\n  This very mandate of the people, as well as protection of the public health and safety was\n   effectuated in the Clean Air Act, 6 the Texas Water Code, 7 and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 8\n   including the right to assess administrative penalties. Protection of Texas' air, water and land\n   is undeniably a compelling interest.\n *456 The form of these particular administrative penalties has certainly been fashioned to serve\nthis important state interest through the least restrictive means. Penalty usage is substantially\nlimited and can in no way be said to be arbitrarily imposed. All three statutes at issue require\nthat, once a violation is established, the agency assessing a penalty must consider such factors as\nthe seriousness of the violation, including but not limited to the nature, circumstance, extent, and\ngravity of the prohibited acts; the hazard or potential hazard created to the public health or safety\nof the public; the history of previous violation; the amount necessary to deter future violations; and\nefforts to correct the violation. 9 There is thus statutory assurance that the amount of any resulting\npenalties will be directly related to the conduct.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nRequiring that assessed penalties be paid, or a bond in the same amount be posted, prior to\nchallenging the agency action in court is not unreasonable under these circumstances. Unlike the\nfiling fee held violative of the open courts provision in LeCroy, the legislative purpose is not to\nraise money by making it more expensive for citizens to enforce their legal rights. Instead, the\nlegislative objective is to deter and punish violations of the law that pose an environmental threat.\n\nThe wheels of justice grind slowly, with final resolution often years in reaching. Indeed, in\nthis court they sometimes hardly grind at all. Clearly those willing to profit from polluting our\nnatural resources will not hesitate to employ the delays in the judicial system to their advantage.\nA declaration of bankruptcy by a perhaps deliberately undercapitalized corporation during the\npendency of a suit is likely to relieve the polluter of any responsibility to remedy the damage it\nhas caused.\n\nShowing no awareness of the purpose of and need for administrative penalties, the majority finds\nthat “expeditious payment” is adequately guaranteed by the ability of the agency, through the\nattorney general, to initiate an enforcement action to collect the amount assessed. 852 S.W.2d at\n449 & n. 15. In other words, the purpose of immediate deterrence of violation of environmental\nlaws is ensured by the filing of a lawsuit that may take as many years to resolve as this case\nhas. These agencies charged with protecting our natural resources have long had the ability to\nbring an enforcement action in state court. See Tex.Water Code § 26.123; Tex.Health & Safety\nCode § 382.081; id. § 361.224. The effort of the Texas Legislature to improve the effectiveness\nof enforcement through the use of administrative penalties is today rendered a nullity.\n\nGiven the time and expense that must be devoted to pursuing an enforcement action in court, the\nState will have the capability to proceed against only the most egregious wrongs. The vast majority\nof administrative penalties to date have been relatively small, reflecting technical yet important\nstatutory violations. 10 In the absence of an administrative penalty power, most of these would\nhave gone unpunished, even though collectively the environmental impact of small violations\ncould be more profound than a major catastrophe. Relieving polluters from immediate sanctions\ndismantles the effectiveness of our laws protecting natural resources; no lesser means has been\nidentified that provides for prompt enforcement. I would hold that the state has demonstrated a\ncompelling interest in environmental protection that has been implemented by the least restrictive\nmeans, thus overriding any modest impediment that the prepayment of penalties may impose on\naccess to the courts.\n\n *457 Not even the slightest evidence has been provided to this court to suggest any actual\nrestrictive effect. No affidavit of any member of the Texas Association of Business appears in\nthe record stating that an inability to pay an administrative penalty has barred judicial review. As\nto most of the penalties assessed, $5,000 or less in amount, it is doubtful that such a contention\ncould be made. The majority necessarily concludes that imposing fines of $2,000 against Exxon\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nChemical Company, Shell Oil Company and Union Carbide Corporation has left those entities\nfinancially unable to pursue an appeal. 11 While the enormity of some future penalty could in\nfact unconstitutionally bar judicial access, that is certainly not the case here. See Jensen v. State\nTax Comm'n, 835 P.2d 965, 969 (Utah 1992) (payment of assessed taxes, penalties and interest as\nprecondition to suit “not unconstitutional in all cases,” but only those in which taxpayer financially\nbarred from prosecuting appeal); see also Morrison v. Chan, 699 S.W.2d 205, 207 (Tex.1985)\n(medical malpractice statute of limitations not unconstitutional as applied to facts of case).\n\nEliminating the need to prove actual restrictive effect, the majority declares “irrelevant” that “the\naffected parties may be able to afford prepayment.” 852 S.W.2d at 450 n. 18. Unexplained is how\nthis statement can be reconciled with Dillingham, in which this court found of critical importance\nthe failure to accommodate those financially unable to post a supersedeas bond as a prerequisite\nto judicial review. Opining that “the guarantee of constitutional rights should not depend on the\nbalance in one's bank account,” id., the majority would accord our state's largest businesses the\nsame treatment as indigents in avoiding financial responsibility for court and other litigation costs.\n\nNor is the majority restrained by Texas decisional law validating similar requirements. We long\nago upheld against this same type of challenge the condition that a corporation pay its franchise\ntaxes in order to file a court action. Federal Crude Oil Co. v. Yount–Lee Oil Co., 122 Tex. 21,\n52 S.W.2d 56 (1932); accord Rimco Enterprises, Inc. v. Texas Elec. Svc. Co., 599 S.W.2d 362\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Various statutory requirements that taxes,\npenalties and interest be paid prior to contesting them in court have likewise sustained an open\ncourts challenge. See Filmstrips and Slides, Inc. v. Dallas Central Appraisal Dist., 806 S.W.2d\n289 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1991, no writ) (property taxes); Robinson v. Bullock, 553 S.W.2d 196\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 918, 98 S.Ct. 2264, 56\nL.Ed.2d 759 (1978) (sales taxes).\n\nThe majority also ignores the certainty that far more than three statutes are impacted by today's\ndecision. A broad range of regulatory enforcement programs vital to protection of the public health\nand safety will be stripped of their most timely and effective sanctions to deter harmful conduct.\nLaws designed to protect the old—residents in nursing homes 12 —the young—our children away\nat camp 13 —the sick and the injured, 14 and those we have lost 15 will be substantially weakened.\nOthers, ensuring the sanitariness of food, drugs and cosmetics, 16 as well as the slaughter and\n*458 disposition of dead animals, 17 will be similarly rendered less effective. 18 Even where such\npenalties have not been frequently enforced, their potential use may promote law enforcement.\n\nThe most widespread damage, however, from today's decision will be in the enforcement of\nlaws protecting our environment, where the Legislature has determined again and again that such\npenalties are the most effective means of assuring compliance and preventing pollution of our\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nair, water and land. 19 The majority ensures that those who pollute will be brought to justice very\nslowly or not at all.\n\nOther statutes that impose administrative penalties permit the filing of an affidavit of inability to\npay in lieu of prepayment or the posting of a bond. 20 Because the majority's reasoning strikes\ndown administrative penalties without reference to financial ability, 852 S.W.2d at 451, these\nstatutes similarly cannot be enforced.\n\nToday's writing poses a potentially crippling effect for collection of taxes. All of our state statutes\nin this area require that assessed taxes, penalty and interest be prepaid before a suit challenging\nthem may be filed. See generally Tex.Tax Code §§ 112.051, 112.101. If such requirements are\nunconstitutionally void even to fulfill a constitutional mandate of environmental protection, their\nvalidity for tax collection is certainly subject to question. See R Communications, Inc. v. Sharp,\n839 S.W.2d 947 (Tex.App.—Austin 1992, writ granted).\n\nNor has the majority sought to consider the consequences of its decision for a major weapon in the\nwar against drugs, forfeiting prior to judicial review money, vehicles and other property alleged to\nhave been used in violating our criminal laws. Tex.Crim.Proc.Code art. 59.02–.11. Most frequently\ninvoked to seize assets from drug dealers, such as money and cars that could finance their defense,\nthis statute provides for the return of property prior to trial only *459 on the posting of a bond\nfor the full value. Id. art. 59.02(b).\n\nProcedures within our judicial system are also threatened. Why is not the requirement that\ncorporations and other organizations appear in court only through counsel a violation of the\nopen courts provision, since the cost of retaining an attorney in most cases exceeds the average\nadministrative penalty considered here?\n\nInadequately considered by the majority's opinion is its effect on the millions of dollars\nin administrative penalties that have already been paid under the statutes now declared\nunconstitutional. Yet, under the general rule that our decisions apply retroactively, past violators of\nenvironmental laws may stand to reap a substantial windfall. 21 In the firm grasp of this majority,\n“open courts” may have been rewritten to mean open coffers. While claiming that nothing in\ntoday's writing suggests that a refund is required, the majority apparently once again concludes that\nmonies extracted by the state under the coercion of an unconstitutional system may be retained.\nSee Carrollton–Farmers Indep. Sch. Dist., 826 S.W.2d at 515–23 (holding tax unconstitutional,\nbut requiring taxpayers to continue payment for two years).\n\nThe majority today throws a large wrench into the workings of the important administrative\nmechanism of our Texas government. By severely limiting enforcement powers, the majority\nleaves law enforcers little choice but to forego prosecution of law violators. Our laws designed\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Trial by Jury\n\nThe harm caused to our environment by today's writing is equalled only by the severe blow struck\nagainst our fundamental right of trial by jury. In holding that TAB and its members have no right to\na jury trial, the majority employs an analysis that has far-reaching ramifications. While I recognize\nthe need to accommodate the evolution of the administrative state, the history of this important\nguarantee mandates that only the narrowest of exceptions be permitted.\n\nThe ability of each individual to have a case heard by other members of the community is a vital\npart of our heritage and law. Long ago, Texans emphasized the paramount importance of this\nguarantee, stating in their grievances against the Mexican government:\n\n            It has failed and refused to secure, on a firm basis, the right of trial by jury,\n            that palladium of civil liberty, and only safe guarantee for the life, liberty, and\n            property of the citizen.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Texas (1836), reprinted in Tex.Const.app.\n519, 520 (Vernon 1955). A strong guarantee of this right had been unsuccessfully sought in an\n1833 draft constitution, 22 which was submitted to Mexico by Stephen F. Austin 23 and was later\nincorporated in the 1836 Texas Independence Constitution. 24\n\nThe central role of the jury as a democratic institution was firmly recognized, indeed celebrated,\nin our early jurisprudence by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas:\n\n            The institution of jury trial has, perhaps, seldom or never been fully appreciated.\n            It has been often eulogized in sounding *460 phrase, and often decried and\n            derided. An occasional corrupt, or biased, or silly verdict is not enough for\n            condemnation; and when it is said the institution interposes chances of justice\n            and checks against venality and oppression, the measure of just praise is not\n            filled. Its immeasurable benefits, like the perennial springs of the earth, flow\n            from the fact that considerable portions of the communities at stated periods are\n            called into the courts to sit as judges of contested facts, and under the ministry\n            of the courts to apply the laws.... Let us then preserve and transmit this mode of\n            trial not only inviolate, but if possible purified and perfected.\n\nBailey v. Haddy, Dallam 35, 40–41 (Tex.1841). 25\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 20\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\nIn 1845, expanding the scope of this right was the subject of spirited debate in the deliberations\nover the new constitution for statehood. In addition to the previous guarantee, which was carried\nforward in a new Bill of Rights, 26 further protection was included in the Judiciary Article. Tex.\nConst. art. IV, § 16 (1845). While under our national Constitution and those of almost all of our\nsister states trial by jury is available only for those actions that could have been brought at common\nlaw, the Texas Constitution since 1845 has also preserved that right in cases that historically would\nhave been brought in equity. Thus, even when a private party seeks injunctive relief that will\ninure to the public's benefit, any derogation of the right to a jury nonetheless violates the Texas\nConstitution.\n\nUrging support of the additional Judiciary Article guarantee, Convention President Thomas Rusk\ndeclared:\n\n            It is a dangerous principle to trust too much power in the hands of one man.\n            Would it not be better to trust a power of this nature in the hands of twelve men,\n            than to confide it to the breast of one?\n\nWilliam F. Weeks, Debates of the Texas Convention 268 (1846). He was opposed by John\nHemphill, later the first Chief Justice of this court, who actually “preferred the civil law” system,\nid. at 271–73, and Jefferson County delegate James Armstrong, who insisted the new section would\n“operate very injuriously.” Id. at 270. He declared:\n\n            It would be better, in my opinion, to leave it to the legislature to apply these\n            things; it is enough for us to say in the constitution that the trial by jury shall be\n            preserved inviolate. If we intend the jury to determine every thing, it would be\n            better to dispense with the judge altogether, as a useless appendage of the court.\n\nId. Today it is this same fear of juries, fortunately rejected in 1845, that now unfortunately prevails.\n\nThe original language providing for trial by jury in the Judiciary Article of 1845 was retained\nin later constitutions, Tex. Const. art. IV, § 16 (1861), Tex. Const. art. IV, § 20 (1866), but was\nthereafter extended to “all cases of law or equity.” Tex. Const. art. V, § 16 (1869). It took its final\nform in our present Constitution of 1876, which continues to afford not one but two assurances\non this vital subject:\n\n            In the trial of all causes in the District Courts, the plaintiff or defendant shall,\n            upon application made in open court, have the right to trial by jury....\n\nTex.

Rather than keeping it “inviolate,” the majority today severely violates\nthis right.\n\n *461 Our heritage is now rejected by the majority in favor of a deliberately overbroad writing\nthat treats trial by jury as a mere anachronism. This is consistent with the majority's increasing\ndisfavor of decisionmaking by ordinary citizens composed as a jury. 27 Today's opinion insists that\nour constitutional assurance of trial by jury does not offer protection against legislative delegation\nof factfinding to an administrative bureaucracy. In essence, the majority engages in a massive\nredistribution of power from the people to the bureaucratic arm of state government. This extreme\nposition is totally unjustified in view of the staunch legal and historical underpinnings of our\nconstitutional commitment to afford Texans a jury of their peers.\n\nToday's opinion accurately describes one element of the dual constitutional protection for this\nfundamental liberty:\n\n            Article I, section 15 of our constitution preserves a right to trial by jury for those\n            actions, or analogous actions, tried to a jury at the time the constitution of 1876\n            was adopted.\n\n852 S.W.2d at 450 (footnote omitted). Then the majority grossly misconstrues this standard while\nmaking selective and misleading use of jurisprudence developed under the further guarantee of\narticle V.\n\nWith its hangnail sketch of Texas history limited to one historian's very generalized description\nof Texas in the era “between 1835 and 1861”, 28 852 S.W.2d at 450, the majority ignores our\nlongstanding concerns regarding threats to our natural resources. As early as 1860, the Legislature\nacted to penalize polluters, providing that:\n\n\n  If any person ... shall in anywise pollute, or obstruct any water course, lake, pond, marsh or\n  common sewer, or continue such obstruction or pollution so as to render the same unwholesome\n  or offensive to the county, city, town or neighborhood thereabouts, or shall do any act or thing\n  that would be deemed and held to be a nuisance at common law, shall be ... fined in any sum\n  not exceeding five hundred dollars.... 29\nIn an early decision considering whether a criminal nuisance was posed by a tallow factory\nnear Galveston at which cattle were slaughtered and their carcasses and offal were allowed to\naccumulate, this court stated:\n\n            It requires no aid of the common law to convince any one accustomed to pure\n            air, and who has been brought by accident or necessity within the sickening\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See generally Horace Wood, Wood's Law of Nuisances 501–\n21, 576–692 (2d ed. 1883) (discussing nuisance recovery at common law for various forms of air\nand water pollution). Such actions were regularly brought in Texas before 1876 to halt activities\nharmful to our air and water. In 1856, this court recognized that “[w]hat constitutes a nuisance\nis well defined.” 30 *462 Burditt v. Swenson, 17 Tex. 489 (1856). Considering an action to\nenjoin operation of a livery stable on Congress Avenue in Austin because “manure and filth has\nalready accumulated to such an extent, that it now causes an unhealthy and disagreeable effluvia,\nexceedingly offensive and prejudicial,” id. at 492, this court concluded such “noisome smells”\nconstituted a nuisance. Id. at 502–03. In City of Fort Worth v. Crawford, 74 Tex. 404, 12 S.W.\n52, 54 (1889), an individual asserted that, because of the dumping of garbage, filth and bodies of\ndead animals on city land,\n\n\n  his home was rendered almost uninhabitable; his family and himself were kept in bad health;\n  and he was, in the language of a witness, “a walking skeleton.”\n  This court further observed that\n\n               The stench was so offensive that he had to shut the doors to eat and\n               sleep.... The testimony shows that the filth on this place of deposit was so\n               indescribable, and was so offensive as to make persons sick, and could be\n               perceived a mile away.\n\n  Id. Affirming the judgment declaring the dump a common law nuisance, this court declared:\n\n               There is also no doubt that every person has a right to have the air diffused\n               over his premises free from noxious vapors and noisome smells....\n\n  Id. 31\nThe majority's suggestion that “pollutants ... are phenomena of relatively recent origin,” 852\nS.W.2d at 451, is contradicted by the nineteenth century legislative response of criminalizing\npollution and the common use of the common law of nuisance to fight soiling of the air and water.\nWith the ongoing construction of the railroads, the mining of coal and sulphur, the emergence\nof industry and the nascence of our oil and gas industry, our state's natural resources were by\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Cobb, Industrialization and Southern\nSociety 1877–1984, 128 (1984) (describing pollution relating to increased rail usage, lumbering\nand urban sewage); see also Robert A. Calvert & Arnoldo De Leon, The History of Texas 186–191\n(1990) (discussing the development of Texas industry in the late 1800's, including lumbering, beef\nprocessing and mining); Louis J. Wortham, 5 A History of Texas (1924) (examining industrial\ndevelopment in the nineteenth century). Only the scope and depth of the problem has changed.\nBut even if the fouling of the environment were a recent technological “innovation” of the past\ncentury, that would be irrelevant. As I recently wrote in another context,\n\n            The law is not irretrievably locked in the days before televisions and\n            videocameras, nor limited to operators of telegraphs and horse-drawn carriages.\n\nBoyles v. Kerr (Tex.1992) (Doggett, J., dissenting). There is nothing about technological change\nthat has made trial by jury any less vital. 32\n\nBut because there was no modern bureaucracy in 1876, the majority insists: “no governmental\nschemes akin to these existed.” Id. at 451. While our laws and society have grown more\ncomplicated, the mandate *463 of our constitution has not. As we concluded in State v. Credit\nBureau of Laredo, Inc., 530 S.W.2d 288, 292 (Tex.1975): “The right to a trial by jury is not\nlimited to the precise form of action ... at common law.” If there was an analogous cause of action\nwith a right to jury trial in 1876, then our article I jury trial guarantee requires it today. Yet the\nmajority ignores the fact that even the earliest of pollution statutes was designed to deter and punish\nthose who harm our environment. Our jury trial article is thus decreed as dependent on form, not\nsubstance; not analogy, but exactitude. Under the majority's analysis, Credit Bureau was wrongly\ndecided since a regulatory prohibition against deceptive non-disclosure or ambiguous language\nwith the capacity to deceive was beyond the “deceptive acts” of common law fraud or deceit as\nit existed in 1876.\n\nSeizing upon the rather obvious proposition that the administrative state had not yet been created\nin 1876, the majority concludes that there is no right to trial by jury in judicial review of an\nadministrative proceeding. But under article I it is the nature of the cause of action that controls,\nnot the procedures under which it is enforced. Each of the three statutes considered today defines\n“pollution” of air, water or land to incorporate early nuisance concepts. Tex. Health & Safety\nCode § 382.003(3) (contaminants that “are or may tend to be injurious to or to adversely affect\nhuman health or welfare, animal life, vegetation or property [or] interferes with the normal use and\nenjoyment of animal life, vegetation, or property”); id. § 361.003(44) ( “contamination of any land\nland or surface or subsurface water in the state that renders the land or water harmful, detrimental,\nor injurious to humans, animal life, vegetation”); Tex. Water Code § 26.001(13) (contamination\nthat “renders the water harmful, deterimental, or injurious to humans, animal life, vegetation, or\nproperty”). The majority fails to examine these provisions and makes no attempt to distinguish\ntheir substance from nuisance actions at the time the constitution was adopted. The focus must\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  24\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nbe on the nature of civil and criminal nuisance actions as they existed in 1876, not on whether\nadministrative agencies existed then to bring such actions. That the creation of some administrative\nagency was not contemplated in 1876 does not mean that any type of factfinding transferred to that\nagency in 1993 or hereafter is beyond the purview of a jury. With its new approach, the majority\nis only clearing the way for a steady expansion of factfinding and decisionmaking by bureaucracy\nat the expense of trial by jury.\n\nConcluding that no common law action analogous to the assessment of administrative penalties\nexisted in 1876, the majority professes a superficial limit on its holding tied to article XVI, § 59(a)\nof the Texas Constitution, as interpreted in Corzelius v. Harrell, 143 Tex. 509, 186 S.W.2d 961\n(1945). 852 S.W.2d at 451 n. 24. Nothing in this provision affects the determination of whether a\nnuisance action for pollution is analogous to an enforcement action for the same conduct. Clearly,\nthe majority's reasoning rests solely on the fact that no administrative agency was charged in\n1876 with protecting the state's resources. Nor does Corzelius in any way address the right to jury\ntrial. Under the majority's asserted “narrow” holding, the right to trial by jury can be immediately\nabrogated in any case in which natural resources are even remotely involved, including private\ndisputes that this court has held are subject to jury trial, such as those involving mineral ownership,\ncontract rights, or mineral lease terms. See, e.g., Amarillo Oil Co. v. Energy–Agri Prod., Inc., 794\nS.W.2d 20, 26 (Tex.1990).\n\nThe constitutional limitation on legislative power to delegate away the people's right to trial by\njury was amply demonstrated by the writing of this court in White v. White, 108 Tex. 570, 196\nS.W. 508 (1917). There a husband had his wife, who apparently did not contest that she was a\n“lunatic,” committed to a state asylum. Commitment proceedings had been statutorily transferred\nto a “commission” appointed by a county judge and comprised of six members, “as many of\n[whom] shall be physicians as may be possible.” Act of *464 April 8, 1913, 33rd Leg., ch. 163,\nart. 152, 1913 Tex.Gen.Laws 342. Although a review of decisions of other states and of federal\npractice indicated substantial support for what appeared to be a quite reasonable legislative attempt\nto entrust the determination of mental competency to the expertise of the medical profession, 196\nS.W. at 514–15, this Court rightly concluded there that\n\n            trial by jury means something more than a hearing before a commission....\n\nId. 196 S.W. at 511. Such “a hearing before a commission, in lieu of the time-honored trial by\njury, is invalid.” Id. 196 S.W. at 515. Moreover,\n\n            [contrary] reasoning [in other jurisdictions] as to the right of the legislature to\n            dispense with jury trials is not applicable to our judicial system and laws, and it\n            is obnoxious to our [Texas] Constitution....”\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

I maintain that the wholesale transfer of authority for factfinding from juries to the bureaucracy\nannounced here is no less offensive to the rights our Constitution guarantees.\n\nBeginning with the constitutional amendment that led to the creation of the Railroad\nCommission, 33 the use of administrative agencies in Texas has steadily increased. Today this\narm of government implements broad legislative plans regulating many areas of public concern,\nincluding the conduct of public utilities, the development and conservation of energy resources,\nand the protection of the environment.\n\nTo preserve the workings of modern government, some exception for administrative proceedings\nmay be necessary, but it should be drawn narrowly so as not to encompass every conceivable\naction that could arguably be assigned to some existing or future administrative body. And that\nis precisely what, until today, our Texas courts have usually done. In two decisions concerning\nadministrative cancellation of a permit to sell liquor, courts narrowly recognized that no “cause\nof action” was involved. The court in Bradley v. Texas Liquor Control Bd., 108 S.W.2d 300\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1937, writ ref'd n.r.e.), specifically excluded from its ruling cases “based\nupon a civil right of [an individual] to compensation.” Relying on Bradley, 34 the court in Texas\nLiquor Control Bd. v. Jones, 112 S.W.2d 227, 229–30 (Tex.Civ.App.—Texarkana 1937, no writ),\nnoted that unlike other administrative proceedings that might involve rights of the same character\nas a “cause of action,” the cancellation of a liquor license is a proceeding brought by the state\npursuant to its police power to protect the “welfare, health, peace ... and safety of the people of\nTexas.”\n\nThis concern for “the safety of the people of Texas”—the rights and needs of the public, id., is not\ndissimilar from the doctrine of “public rights” rather imperfectly employed by the federal courts.\nState cancellation of a liquor license essentially represents a “public right.” In Atlas Roofing Co.\nv. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n, 430 U.S. 442, 97 S.Ct. 1261, 51 L.Ed.2d 464\n(1977), the court distinguished between cases involving governmental action to protect the public\nhealth and safety and those involving only private rights:\n\n            At least in cases in which “public rights” are being litigated—e.g., cases in which\n            the government sues in its sovereign capacity to enforce public rights created by\n            statutes ... [the constitutional right to a jury trial] does not prohibit ... assign[ment\n            of] the factfinding function to an administrative forum with which the jury would\n            be incompatible.\n\nId. at 450, 97 S.Ct. at 1266.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nBradley and Jones are also consistent with writings in other jurisdictions strictly excluding from\nany administrative public rights exception actions invoking private *465 rights for which the\nConstitution mandates a right to trial by jury:\n\n            Although the award of general compensatory damages may have substantive\n            effect, in that it deters violation of the regulatory scheme ... when the\n            damages awarded advance a substantial private interest in remuneration that\n            is disproportionate to the concept of public relief, the right to a jury trial is\n            implicated and a jury is required.\n\nMcHugh v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., 49 Cal.3d 348, 261 Cal.Rptr. 318, 344, 777 P.2d\n91, 117 (1989) (Panelli, J., concurring); Bishop Coal Co. v. Salyers, 181 W.Va. 71, 380 S.E.2d\n238, 246 (1989) (subjective determinations of damages are constitutionally entrusted to juries);\nBroward County v. La Rosa, 505 So.2d 422, 424 (Fla.1987) (constitutional right to jury precludes\nadministrative awards of unliquidated damages).\n\nFortunately the rights of Texans are not constrained by whether the right to a jury trial was\npreserved in analogous actions in 1876. We have written quite clearly that an even broader right\nto trial by jury is afforded under article V, section 10 than under article I, section 15. 35 State v.\nCredit Bureau of Laredo, Inc., 530 S.W.2d 288, 292 (Tex.1975). Relying on Walsh v. Spencer,\n275 S.W.2d 220, 223 (Tex.Civ.App.—San Antonio 1954, no writ), which described the “much\nbroader guarantee” of the Judiciary Article, and Tolle v. Tolle, 101 Tex. 33, 104 S.W. 1049, 1050\n(1907), which said of the provision, “[l]anguage cannot be more comprehensive than this,” we\nexpressly disapproved of earlier cases “mistakenly” treating the two provisions\n\n\n  as identical in meaning, that is, as protecting the right of trial by jury only as it existed at common\n  law or by statutes in effect at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.\n  530 S.W.2d at 292 (citing Hickman v. Smith, 238 S.W.2d 838 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1951,\n  writ ref'd), as improperly assigning the two provisions equivalent meaning). We held that the\n  Judiciary Article affords a unique right to trial by jury even for causes of action unknown at the\n   time of the Constitution's adoption. Id. 36\nInstead of heeding this holding, the majority seizes upon a citation to a commentary in that writing\nas an excuse to rewrite the Constitution. In the discussion of the article V jury trial guarantee in\nCredit Bureau, which involved no administrative action, we noted a few “isolated” proceedings\nthat do not constitute a “cause” that have been identified on a “case-by-case determination.” Id.\nat 293. We made shorthand reference to a commentator's brief list of exceptions carved from the\notherwise inviolate right to trial by jury. Id. (citing Whitney R. Harris, Jury Trial in Civil Cases—\nA Problem in Constitutional Interpretation, 7 Sw.L.J. 1, 8 (1953) (listing child custody by habeas\ncorpus and adoption proceedings, election contests, and contempt proceedings)). Additionally,\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    27\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nHarris relied upon Jones for the broader proposition that proceedings originally brought before\nadministrative agencies are excepted from constitutional jury rights. 7 Sw.L.J. at 12–13. 37\n\n *466 Today the majority overexpands this exception before considering the rule it prefers that\nexception to swallow. In Credit Bureau we attributed “broad meaning [to] the word ‘cause.’ ” 530\nS.W.2d at 292. In defining it, we did not limit its meaning in the past, but turned to a relatively\ncontemporary dictionary as well as older authority. Id. Clearly this term must adapt to modern\ndevelopments; our understanding of a “cause” is not frozen in 1876. See Davenport v. Garcia, 834\nS.W.2d 4, 19 (Tex.1992). Both the text of our Constitution and its historical backdrop demand\nthat the right to trial by jury remain “inviolate.” When, as here, however, changing circumstances\nrequire reexamination of the scope of this right in order to preserve the evolved workings of\ngovernment, we must ensure that any exception does not destroy the guarantee. 38 We should\ninstead follow the command of our Constitution in light of our contemporary situation, by limiting\nany exception in the most narrow way possible without completely undermining the administrative\nstate.\n\nI would accordingly clarify any existing exception for administrative proceedings to preserve\nthe right to trial by jury in all suits except those in which the state is enforcing a regulation\nor statute protecting the public. If construed too broadly, however, even this exception limited\nto “public rights” could destroy our traditional reliance on the jury system. 39 Indeed, despite\nthe writing in Atlas Roofing, such erosion has already begun at the federal level. 40 Properly\nlimited, however, a “public rights” administrative exception to the right to trial by jury is both\nconstitutionally sound and easy to apply. While perhaps far-reaching in other contexts, “public\nrights” that conflict with the right of each member of the public to have factual disputes resolved\nby a public jury must be narrowly construed. I would not permit the concept of “public rights”\nto be perverted to deny such a fundamental right. In this limited circumstance, I would define\nproceedings involving “public rights” as those in which the government, as a real party in interest,\nenforces a regulatory or statutory scheme. Contrary to the majority, I do not suggest that we follow\nits standard preference for copying a “federal test,” 852 S.W.2d at 451 n. 24. Rather, I recommend\na narrow and clear Texas standard that looks to Texas law predating Atlas Roofing, and which\nlearns from the misapplication of this doctrine in the federal courts.\n\nHere TAB's members are not entitled to a jury trial because the state is enforcing public regulations\nby imposing administrative penalties. Although this action is analogous to a common law nuisance\nclaim, here the state is protecting the public's right to a clean environment rather than an *467\nindividual's use and enjoyment of private property.\n\nThe right to trial by jury is a critical state constitutional guarantee. Denigrating my concern with\nprotecting this liberty, the majority dismisses my writing as “trumpeting.” 852 S.W.2d at 451 n.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The trumpet call has sounded from the very earliest days of our Republic, heralding our right\nto trial by jury, a clarion to our citizens to shout out to preserve their heritage against attack. It\ndemands that any intrusion on this right be narrow in scope, clearly-announced and thoughtfully\nconsidered. The majority's refusal to define with certainty its erosion of the right to trial by jury\nsounds a weak and shaky chord, reflecting a lack of commitment to this fundamental guarantee.\nAttempting to let the strong note drown the weak, the majority seeks to hide its equivocation by\nreference to my conclusion that a jury trial is not required under these anti-pollution statutes, id.,\nand by criticizing the narrow, clear and thoughtful exception I have drawn today. Id.\n\nThe inviolate nature of the right to trial by jury demands that this vital guarantee be circumscribed\nin only the most extraordinary circumstances and that any exception to it be clearly and narrowly\nconstrued. Although I do not disagree with the result announced by the majority, the analysis\nemployed is designed to destroy one of our most precious freedoms as Texans. The alternative\nI offer would permit our administrative bodies to implement efficiently their regulations, while\nensuring that efficiency concerns do not envelop a fundamental civil liberty. 41\n\n\n\n                                                 III. Standing\n\nThe issue of standing is a stranger to this litigation. No party before this court has ever asserted that\nthe Texas Association of Business lacked capacity to challenge the actions of state government.\nHow rare the occasion when all litigants agree on the proper resolution of an issue, but how truly\nextraordinary is such unanimity when the parties are two state regulatory agencies, the Texas\nAssociation of Business, the Sierra Club and the League of Women Voters. This, nonetheless,\nis the exceptional circumstance in which we find ourselves today as all of these diverse parties\nhave urged the court not to decide this matter in the manner adopted. Addressing the question\nof standing solely at the belated insistence of the majority, all parties asserted that this issue was\nnot in dispute; that, under recent precedent, standing had been waived; 42 and, alternatively, that\nthe record adequately demonstrated the right of the Texas Association of Business under Texas\nlaw to initiate this litigation. Why then does the majority insist on writing? Because it dare not\npass up the opportunity to close access to our courts to those citizens who choose to challenge\nenvironmental degradation, neighborhood destruction and consumer abuse. Through a narrowly\ncrafted test, the majority extends an invitation to TAB to come into the courts while telling other\npublic interest groups to stay out.\n\nWhile devoting over half of today's opinion to a nonissue in this litigation, the majority oddly\nlimits its inquiry to only one of the three organizations asserting standing here. Nothing is said as\nto the League of Women Voters and the Sierra Club, both of which intervened in the trial court\nand were aligned as defendants with the State. Asserting the interests of its members in water and\nair quality, as well as its involvement in protecting the state's natural resources, the League of\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    29\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nWomen Voters claimed standing to defend the challenged regulations. Similarly, the Sierra Club\n *468 based its standing on its purpose of environmental enhancement and conservation of natural\nresources. By completely ignoring whether these groups were proper parties and by embracing a\nfederal standing test hostile to their participation, the majority erects new barriers to deny Texans\naccess to Texas courts.\n\nTo achieve this result, the majority must overcome what, until recently, was viewed as a\nconsiderable obstacle—Texas law. This court has repeatedly held that the issue of standing may\nnot be raised for the first time on appeal, either by the parties or by the court. In Texas Industrial\nTraffic League v. Railroad Comm'n of Texas, 633 S.W.2d 821, 822–23 (Tex.1982), we concluded:\n\n  A party's lack of justiciable interest must be pointed out to the trial court ... in a written plea in\n  abatement, and a ruling thereon must be obtained or the matter is waived.\n\n  No plea challenging the standing of [the party] was filed in the district court. The issue of\n  standing was therefore waived, and the court of appeals erred in writing on the issue at all.\n\n(Emphasis supplied). The sole issue presented in Coffee v. William Marsh Rice University, 403\nS.W.2d 340 (Tex.1966), was whether the court of appeals erred in dismissing a case, on its own\nmotion, for want of standing. This court held that, because standing had not been challenged in the\ntrial court, that issue could not deprive the court of appeals of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. at 347–\n48. Assuming that standing was lacking in Sabine River Authority of Texas v. Willis, 369 S.W.2d\n348, 349–50 (Tex.1963), 43 this court nonetheless held that dismissal was erroneous, because the\nabsence of a justiciable interest was not first raised in the trial court. We have repeatedly cited\nthese decisions with approval. See Central Educ. Agency v. Burke, 711 S.W.2d 7, 8 (Tex.1986)\n(per curiam); American General Fire & Casualty Co. v. Weinberg, 639 S.W.2d 688 (Tex.1982);\nCox v. Johnson, 638 S.W.2d 867, 868 (Tex.1982) (per curiam).\n\nTime and time again, the courts of appeals have also refused to consider challenges to standing not\nfirst raised in the trial court. 44 Until today, the only criticism of our prior holdings to this effect\nhas *469 consisted primarily of writings authored by one appellate judge. 45\n\nThe majority has a simple way to deal with this venerable body of law—overrule only one case,\nmaking today's abrupt change in the law appear less drastic, while ignoring the rest. In fact,\nsix Texas Supreme Court cases must be overruled and no less than twenty-five decisions of the\ncourts of appeals must be disapproved to reach today's result. The concept of reliance on the prior\ndecisions of Texas courts has long since ceased to offer the slightest restraint on this majority. 46\n\nBulldozing a new path through this jurisprudential forest, the majority vaults standing to a new\nand remarkable prominence by suddenly discovering that it has not just one but two constitutional\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     30\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nbases. And what unusual constitutional pillars each of these new finds represents. First, the\nproscription of the separation of powers doctrine against issuance of advisory judicial opinions\nallegedly requires rigorous enforcement of standing even when no party debates its existence. This\nlink between standing and separation of powers is not predicated on any directly relevant prior\ncourt decision, 47 but instead is entirely premised on an article openly antagonistic to standing\nfor environmental groups. 852 S.W.2d at 444, citing Atonin Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as\nan Essential Element of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U.L.Rev. 881 (1983). The current\nmajority may be the first in the nation to anchor standing on this constitutional theory.\n\nThe authorities addressing the prohibition on advisory opinions cited in support of this proposition,\nof course, in no way implicate the question of standing. This precedent-setting concern with\nadvisory opinions contrasts markedly with the eagerness to issue this very type of writing within\nthe last year. See Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Kirby, 804 S.W.2d 491, 501 (Tex.1991) (Doggett,\nJ., concurring); Carrollton–Farmers Branch Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist., 826\nS.W.2d 489, 537 (Tex.1992) (Doggett, J., dissenting) (advisory opinions issued and retracted as\nnecessary to thwart efforts to satisfy the constitutional command of equity and efficiency in our\npublic schools). Writing on an issue not raised by any party, as the majority reaches out to revise\nthe law of standing today, seems to me the very essence of an “advisory” opinion.\n\nThe second newly-announced constitutional basis is equally ironic—our state's vital guarantee\nthat “[a]ll courts shall be open,” Tex. Const. art. I, § 13, in some inexplicable way, mandates that\nthey be closed to some and requires continual judicial monitoring of all who attempt to enter. No\nauthority of any type is cited for this *470 proposition that “open” courts really means “closed”\ncourts. Nothing in the history or text of the provision justifies this reading nor has any Texas court\npreviously attempted such converse interpretation. This constitutional guarantee is used today as a\ntwo-edged sword: the majority invokes the open courts provision to bar environmental groups from\nseeking judicial assistance in enforcing the laws, while in the very same opinion misinterpreting\nthis provision to allow continued violation of statutes protecting our precious natural resources. 48\n\nThen, with a final flourish, standing is conveniently classified as a nonwaivable component of\nsubject matter jurisdiction. Until today, Texas followed the rule, adopted by many of our sister\nstates considering the issue, that objections to a party's standing are waived if not first raised in\nthe trial court. 49 No Texas case is cited for the proposition that standing is part of nonwaivable\nsubject matter jurisdiction because, until today, this court had repeatedly stated precisely the very\nopposite—that standing is not jurisdictional. 50\n\nTexas has with good reason determined that standing is not excepted from traditional rules of\nappellate procedure. Our appellate system is predicated on the requirement of presentation of\ncomplaints to the lower court coupled with preservation and briefing in the reviewing court. See\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 31\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nTex.R.App.P. 52; 74(d), 131(e). Appellate courts face considerable difficulties in deciding an issue\nnot presented to the trial court; ordinarily, the necessary facts will not be fully developed. The\nunstated effect of today's opinion is to require trial courts to develop facts as to undisputed issues\nor risk subsequent appellate reversal. This is not an effective use of our limited judicial resources.\n\nThe requirement that issues first be presented to the trial court serves another function—preventing\nparties from “laying behind the log”:\n\n            The reason for the requirement that a litigant preserve a trial predicate for\n            complaint on appeal is that one should not be permitted to waive, consent to,\n            or neglect to complain about an error at trial and then surprise his opponent on\n            appeal by stating his complaint for the first time.\n\nPirtle v. Gregory, 629 S.W.2d 919, 920 (Tex.1982). While this court has condemned “trial by\nambush,” *471 Gutierrez v. Dallas Indep. School Dist., 729 S.W.2d 691, 693 (Tex.1987), today\nthe majority promotes “ambush on appeal.”\n\nThree purported policy justifications for the majority's actions are offered, with not a single\nsupporting authority. The first concern is that a strict standing rule is necessary to prevent\ncollusive litigation. Under Texas law, the filing of a fictitious suit constitutes contempt by counsel,\nTex.R.Civ.P. 13, and may serve as the basis for a host of sanctions, including dismissal with\nprejudice. Tex.R.Civ.P. 215 2b(5). Nor does our Texas judiciary lack the ability to reject collusive\nlitigation. Felderhoff v. Felderhoff, 473 S.W.2d 928, 932 (Tex.1971) (“We believe that our laws\nand judicial system are adequate to ferret out and prevent collusion....”); cf. Whitworth v. Bynum,\n699 S.W.2d 194, 197 (Tex.1985) (refusing to uphold Texas Guest Statute because of danger\nof collusion). Adhering to precedent today would in no way undermine the power to dismiss\nfraudulent suits.\n\nThe second virtue proclaimed for today's holding is the guarantee that the lower courts will be\nrestrained from exceeding their jurisdictional powers. 852 S.W.2d at 445. This concern is derived\nsolely from the federal law mandate that a federal appellate court is duty-bound to verify not only\nits own jurisdiction but that of the lower courts as well. Federal courts, however, have limited\njurisdiction; Texas courts do not. Our Texas Constitution creates courts of general jurisdiction,\ninvesting them with all of the “judicial power of this State.” Tex. Const. art. V, § 1. The differences\nare evident in our procedural rules. While a federal court must affirmatively ascertain jurisdiction\nover parties appearing before it, a Texas court's jurisdiction is presumed until proven lacking by\na contesting party. See Tex.R.Civ.P. 120a.\n\nLastly, the majority expresses concern as to the res judicata effect on other potential litigants\nof a judgment rendered in the absence of genuine standing. 852 S.W.2d at 445–446. Aware of\nthis concern, the very federal judiciary that this majority is so eager to emulate has failed to\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  32\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nperceive it as a problem of significance. International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and\nAgricultural Implement Workers of America v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 290, 106 S.Ct. 2523, 91\nL.Ed.2d 228 (1986). If representation is inadequate, or a conflict of interest between members\nexists, any judgment will have minimal preclusive effect. Id. Instead of completely barring access\nto the courts, procedural safeguards can ameliorate any potentially overbroad effects. See generally\nCharles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, 18 Federal Practice & Procedure §\n4456 at 490–94 (1981 & Supp.1991).\n\nThe manufactured nature of the majority's concerns becomes all the more evident when the real\nworld experience of Texas is considered. The majority is unable to point to a single example of\ncollusion during the three decades our Texas rule, which allows the issue of standing to be waived,\nhas been in place. During this period there have likewise been no examples of lower courts making\na grab for extrajurisdictional power, nor of oppressed litigants shackled by the res judicata effect\nof contrived litigation.\n\nIn defining state requirements for standing, we are in no way bound by federal jurisprudence\nfounded upon converse jurisdictional principles from our own. Texas courts can afford their\ncitizens access to justice in circumstances where they would have been unable to establish standing\nin the federal courts. See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 113, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1671,\n75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (“state courts need not impose the same standing ... requirements that\ngovern federal-court proceedings”); Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429, 434, 72 S.Ct.\n394, 397, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952) (state courts not restrained by “case or controversy” limitations of\nFederal Constitution); Greer v. Illinois Housing Development Auth., 122 Ill.2d 462, 120 Ill.Dec.\n531, 524 N.E.2d 561 (1988) (“We are not, of course, required to follow the Federal law on issues\nof justiciability and standing.”).\n\nThe differences between our Texas Constitution and the Federal Constitution not only justify,\nbut also require, that citizen groups be accorded a broader right of access *472 to our state\ncourts. The Texas Constitution contains no express limitation of courts' jurisdiction to “cases” or\n“controversies,” as provided by the federal charter. U.S. Const. art. III, § 2. Instead, it affirmatively\nprotects the rights of litigants to gain access to our judicial system:\n\n            All courts shall be open, and every person for an injury done him, in his lands,\n            goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law.\n\nTex. Const. art. 1, § 13. As this court has recognized,\n\n            The provision's wording and history demonstrate the importance of the right of\n            access to the courts.... The right of access to the courts has been at the foundation\n            of the American democratic experiment.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hanlon, 713 S.W.2d 335, 339 (Tex.1986).\n\nThis constitutional mandate is reflected in decisions of this court adopting an “open courts”\napproach to standing in general and associational standing in particular. On several occasions,\nwe have recognized the power of the Legislature to exempt litigants from proof of “special\ninjury.” Scott v. Board of Adjustment, 405 S.W.2d 55, 56 (Tex.1966) (standing may be shown\neven in the absence of particular damage); Spence v. Fenchler, 107 Tex. 443, 180 S.W. 597\n(1915) (under statute, “any citizen” able to seek injunction, without showing particular interest or\npersonal damage). 51 In enacting the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, the Texas Legislature\nhas granted a broad right of standing: any person “whose rights, status or other legal relations are\naffected by a statute” may seek a declaration of those rights. Tex.Civ.Prac. & Rem.Code § 37.004\n(emphasis supplied).\n\nThis court has previously extended its “open courts” approach to groups representing the interests\nof their members. 52 In Texas Highway Comm'n v. Texas Ass'n of Steel Importers, 372 S.W.2d\n525, 530–31 (Tex.1963), we permitted a business association to challenge an administrative order.\nAlthough the order addressed only the import of foreign products for highway construction, this\ncourt recognized standing of an organization whose interest in foreign imports was not so limited:\n\n\n  Some of [the respondents] are owners of imported foreign manufactured products suitable for\n  highway construction purposes. All of them are actively engaged in the sale and use of imported\n  manufactured products.... [S]uch parties clearly have the right and litigable interest to have the\n  challenged ... Order declared null and void.\n  Id. at 531. Similarly, in Touchy v. Houston Legal Foundation, 432 S.W.2d 690 (Tex.1968), the\n  court considered whether an organization of attorneys had standing to maintain a suit against\n  a charitable corporation to restrain violations of ethical canons governing the practice of law.\n  Based solely on “the special interest attorneys have in their profession,” the court held standing\n  was established.\nThe “open courts” approach 53 of Touchy and Texas Highway Commission is quite sufficient to\nallow TAB access to the Texas *473 courts. 54 These two associational standing cases are all but\nignored today, brushed aside as setting forth “no particular test.” 852 S.W.2d at 446.\n\nYet in these cases in which the merits of standing are preserved for appellate court review, the\nTexas test applied has not been complicated. We simply look to whether a party has a stake in\nthe action sufficient to ensure adversarial presentation of the issues and to whether the court's\njudgment will have any effect on those before it. See Board of Water Engineers v. City of San\nAntonio, 155 Tex. 111, 283 S.W.2d 722, 724 (1955) (“there shall be a real controversy between the\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               34\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nparties, which ... will be actually determined by the judicial declaration sought.”). Because both\nof these considerations are met in the instant case, reference to federal law is wholly unnecessary.\n\nToday, however, to justify meddling with Texas standing law, the majority declares that “we\nforesee difficulties” not here with TAB, but in future cases involving organizational standing. 852\nS.W.2d at 446. To cure these perceived but as yet totally unrealized woes, the majority imposes\na difficult to meet, easy to manipulate standard drawn from federal law “that lends itself to our\nuse.” Id. at 447. Never needing an invitation to impose more federal requirements on Texas\ncitizens, the majority writes into our Texas law books the confused and troubling federal standing\nlimitations. Not surprisingly, that law has taken a regressive turn, denying standing to public\ninterest associations, including those seeking to protect the environment. See Gene R. Nichol, Jr.,\nAbusing Standing: A Comment on Allen v. Wright, 133 U.Pa.L.Rev. 635, 659 (1985) (“One could\nperhaps be forgiven for confusing standing's agenda with that of the New Right.”).\n\nThe benefits of permitting an association to represent the concerns of its members are manifest.\nAs recognized in United Auto Workers, 477 U.S. at 290, 106 S.Ct. at 2533, “[T]he primary reason\npeople join an organization is often to create an effective vehicle for vindicating interests that\nthey share with others.” Judicial economy is promoted when one litigant can, in a single lawsuit,\nadequately represent many members with similar interests, thus avoiding repetitive and costly\nactions. The wider range of resources often available for associations enhances their effectiveness\nin litigation:\n\n  Special features, advantageous both to the individuals represented and to the judicial system as\n  a whole, ... distinguish suits by associations on behalf of their members.... An association suing\n  can draw upon a pre-existing reservoir of expertise and capital. “Besides financial resources,\n  organizations often have specialized expertise and research resources relating to the subject\n  matter of the lawsuit that individual plaintiffs lack.” ... These resources assist both courts and\n  plaintiffs.\n\nId. at 289–90, 106 S.Ct. at 2532–33. In some cases, an injury that is substantial as to many may have\nan individual financial impact too small to make a challenge economically feasible. Associational\nrepresentation may be the only means of redressing conduct when the harm is limited in degree but\nsubstantial segments of society are affected. Additionally, in challenging policies of government,\norganizations are generally less susceptible than individuals to retaliation by the bureaucrats they\nchallenge.\n\nThese benefits are ignored as the majority declares that henceforth the right of associations to bring\nsuit in Texas courts will be constricted by a three-part federal test set forth in Hunt v. Washington\nState Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977),\nrequiring that “(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the\ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's *474 purpose; and (c) neither the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nclaim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the\nlawsuit.” 55\n\nYet the Hunt test won't hunt in Texas. It is adopted purportedly because of the similarities between\nthe state and federal constitutional underpinnings of the standing doctrine. Two critical factors\nare ignored: (1) the significant differences between the Texas and United States Constitutions and\n(2) the fact that much of federal standing doctrine is not mandated by the federal charter, but is\nimposed solely on the grounds of judicial “prudence.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498, 95\nS.Ct. 2197, 2205, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (“This [standing] inquiry involves both constitutional\nlimitations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.”).\n\nThe majority works a grave disservice to our Texas Constitution by equating our open courts\nprovision, affirmatively guaranteeing all Texans access to our judicial system, with an express\nfederal constitutional limitation on the right to seek redress in court. Despite the fact that the\ntwo provisions are vastly different in language, history and purpose, the majority nonetheless\ndetermines to “look to the more extensive jurisprudential experience of the federal courts” to\ndetermine standing. This is clearly an erroneous course. See Davenport v. Garcia, 834 S.W.2d\n4 (Tex.1992, orig. proceeding) (in blindly adhering to federal law, “based on different language,\ndifferent history and different cases, “[f]rom our treasured state heritage, law and institutions ...\n[we] derive nothing....”).\n\nEven the federal constitutional constraint is a simple one, looking to whether “the plaintiff has\n‘alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy’ as to warrant his invocation of\nthe court's remedial powers on his behalf.” Warth, 422 U.S. at 498, 95 S.Ct. at 2205, quoting Baker\nv. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 1103, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). In fact, this bare-bones test\nclosely resembles the approach that Texas courts have long chosen to follow. To the extent Hunt\nconstructs additional barriers to access to our judicial system, they are wholly court-created. 56 No\njustification for their adoption is contained in the majority opinion.\n\nMoreover, in turning to the federal law of standing, the majority invokes a doctrine that has been\ncriticized more heavily and justifiably than perhaps any other. See, e.g., Gene R. Nichol, Jr.,\nRethinking Standing, 72 Cal.L.Rev. 68, 68 (1984); Mark V. Tushnet, The “Case or Controversy”\nControversy, 93 Harv.L.Rev. 1698, 1713–21 (1980). Even the United States Supreme Court has\nrecognized that federal standing requirements have an “iceberg quality,” Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S.\n83, 94, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1949, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968); yet the majority fails to navigate a course,\nnot unlike the captain of the Titanic, that would steer Texas well away from this potential disaster.\n\nThe concept of standing is “employed to refuse to decide the merits of a legal claim.” Charles\nA. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure § 3531, at\n338. Critics of the doctrine's complexity and uncertainty have recognized how subject it is to\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nmanipulation: “standing ... is no more than a convenient tool to avoid uncomfortable issues or\nto disguise a surreptitious ruling on the merits.” Id. at 348 (citing commentaries). 57 Important\nrights can be left unprotected *475 as a result. Id. at § 3531.3, 416–17 (“Standing decisions\npresent courts with an opportunity to avoid the vindication of unpopular rights, or even worse to\ndisguise a decision on the merits in ... opaque standing terminology.... Unarticulated and arbitrary\npredilection, cast as standing, defeats rights that deserve judicial protection.”).\n\nEven during the three years that this particular cause has been pending here, the federal courts\nhave been hard at work to manipulate standing requirements to bar public interest groups from\nseeking judicial vindication of rights common to their members. In Lujan v. National Wildlife\nFederation, 497 U.S. 871, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990), a nationally-recognized\nenvironmental group challenged a new development classification for certain federal wilderness\nareas that allegedly violated several federal statutes. The suit was dismissed for lack of standing\nbased upon a rigid construction of the requirement of injury to the association's members. This\ndecision has been widely criticized as significantly impairing the ability of public interest groups\nto represent their members, particularly those that seek to protect this nation's environment and\nnatural resources. 58 Today the majority eagerly positions itself to give the same treatment to\nthose Texans who would petition our state courts to protect the public interest. The majority\nnot only conspicuously relies on Lujan, 852 S.W.2d at 445, but also embraces the extremist\nanti-environmental stance propounded in an article openly critical of judicial opinions permitting\ncitizens to complain of harm inflicted upon our natural resources. Id. at 443–444, citing Atonin\nScalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk\nU.L.Rev. 881 (1983).\n\nRather than a careful consideration of our Texas precedent and our unique Texas Constitution,\ntoday Texans are handed yet another unthinking embrace of federal law. Claiming “guidance”\nfrom federal precedent, 852 S.W.2d at 445, the majority overrules all Texas cases treating standing\nas a procedural issue, then unnecessarily modifies all Texas precedent addressing the merits of\nstanding. Without explanation, today's opinion simply photocopies into our Texas law books\nthe federal law of standing with all of its much-criticized complexities. Once again the majority\nchooses more Washington wisdom for Texas when what we need is more Texas thinking in\nWashington. See Bexar County Sheriff's Civ. Service Comm'n v. Davis, 802 S.W.2d 659, 665\n(Tex.1990) (Doggett, J., dissenting).\n\nWhile today the corporate members of the Texas Association of Business are permitted to\nchallenge the bureaucracy, tomorrow this same reasoning will be employed to bar public\ninterest, neighborhood, environmental and consumer groups from vindicating the rights of their\nmembers. Today's opinion not only repudiates our past “open courts” approach to access to the\njudicial system but also eliminates the long-recognized appellate requirement that *476 error be\npreserved. The majority has charged well beyond traditional constraints in its writing.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\nTo the extent this case is about standing, it is about standing still, about closing the courthouse\ndoor, once standing open. For today the majority extends a standing invitation to those who would\nharm our environment to act without fear of citizen challenge in the Texas courts.\n\n\n\n                                                IV. Conclusion\n\nToday the environment is the immediate victim. Those who pollute our rivers, release toxins into\nour air, and damage our land cannot be promptly penalized. Instead, only after the very slow\nwheels of our judicial system have creaked to a stop will violators of environmental protection\nlaws be held accountable.\n\nYet the environment is not the whole story. Much as a river may seem pure and clear even at the\nplace where illegal sewage is being pumped into it, the danger from a court's opinion may not\nbe immediately apparent on its surface. Only after the reasoning is applied in other cases is the\nseverity of the resulting harm to our system of justice revealed. Today's impairment of the ability\nof concerned citizens to vindicate the rights of many in our courts and the majority's knockout\npunch to the right of trial by jury will unfold in future cases to bar participation of ordinary citizens\nin Texas courts.\n\nThe mess in Texas is not only with our environment but with the misinterpretation of the law.\n\n\nGAMMAGE, Justice, concurring and dissenting.\nThough I would prefer not to write separately, I find I am unable to agree entirely with any single\nopinion of the court's other members. I must write this concurring and dissenting opinion because,\nwhile I agree with the disposition of this cause, I disagree with substantial portions of the reasoning\nand language in the majority's opinion and I agree with part of Justice Doggett's concurring and\ndissenting opinion.\n\nI agree with the preliminary portion of Justice Cornyn's majority opinion, which correctly sets\nforth the regulatory scheme and basic dispute.\n\nI agree substantially with Part II of Justice Doggett's opinion and his jury trial discussion. In my\nview, whether or not a suit is a “cause” for purposes of the right to a jury trial is not controlled\nby whether it was first determined by an administrative agency. I also agree with Part III of\nJustice Doggett's opinion relating to standing, which I will further address below. I agree with\nPart II of Justice Cornyn's majority opinion. The statutes may not condition access to the courts\non prepayment of a penalty. The principle here is the same as for a supersedeas bond. The statute\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nmay condition the right to restrain the prevailing party (the State) from executing (enforcing) its\njudgment (administrative order) on the posting of a bond for the full amount. It may not, however,\ncondition the right to appeal the judgment on posting of the full penalty imposed. Dillingham v.\nPutnam, 109 Tex. 1, 5–6, 14 S.W. 303, 304 (1890). This is true even if that “judgment” takes the\nform of an administrative agency decision. Administrative agency decisions, for the most part,\nentitle an appellant to only “substantial evidence” as opposed to de novo review. To further burden\nthose regulated with prepayment of the “judgment” as the only alternative to total loss of even\nsubstantial evidence review violates the basic concept of our constitutional open courts in Texas.\n\nAs to the issue (or non-issue) of standing, the majority in effect adopts the position of federal courts\nthat standing is a jurisdictional question. Otherwise it cannot be fundamental error to be addressed\nwhen no party raises it. Standing was not raised and should not be addressed in this cause.\n\nEven assuming standing is an element of subject matter jurisdiction, the court should not write\non the issue in this case. Even though a judgment is void and subject to collateral attack at any\npoint if there is an absence of subject matter jurisdiction, see *477 Mercer v. Phillips Natural\nGas Co., 746 S.W.2d 933, 936 (Tex.App.—Austin 1988, writ denied), unassigned error of lack of\njurisdiction should be addressed only if jurisdiction is in fact lacking. Since the majority concludes\nthere was standing in this case, and since no party raised its existence as an issue, there is no reason\nto address it at all, even if it would be fundamental error if lacking.\n\nThe basis for the majority's discussion is its sudden revelation that “[s]tanding is implicit in\nthe concept of subject matter jurisdiction.” 852 S.W.2d at 443. Their opinion then claims this\nimplication comes from the separation of powers doctrine and the open courts provision of the\nTexas Constitution. It is a curiosity of legal scholarship, however, that in the 156 prior years of\nits existence, this court never before found standing “implicit” in those constitutional provisions,\nbut in fact wrote that standing could be waived and hence was not fundamental error. Texas\nIndus. Traffic League v. Railroad Comm'n, 633 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex.1982). Justice Doggett's\nopinion adequately addresses why there is no implication from those provisions that standing is\njurisdictional.\n\nThe majority's struggle to put standing in issue whenit is not prompts me to address two statements\nin its opinion which strike me as either misleading or just plain wrong. The majority asserts,\nwithout citation to authority, that “[s]ubject matter jurisdiction is never presumed,” 852 S.W.2d at\n443–444, and in a footnote repeats that assertion in urging that “Justice Doggett confuses subject\nmatter jurisdiction with personal jurisdiction. Only the latter can be waived when uncontested. See\nTEX.R.CIV.P. 120a.” 852 S.W.2d at 444 n. 5. The majority's claim that subject matter jurisdiction\nis never presumed is at its very best misleading.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   39\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nConnected with this discussion is the implicit assertion in another footnote that there is a\n“jurisdictional standing” that is different from “objections to join a real party in interest or to a\nparty's capacity to sue rather than jurisdictional standing.” 852 S.W.2d at 445 n. 7. These remarks\nare made in an attempt to distinguish the cases cited by Justice Doggett from those of other states\nholding that standing is not jurisdictional. I suppose we should be encouraged to find out that there\nare some types of “standing” that will not be jurisdictional, but it occurs to me that by using the term\n“jurisdictional standing” the court is begging the question—if it is jurisdictional, then it must be\nfundamental. The problem is that the Texas cases, at least as I read them, define “standing” in terms\nof “the party's capacity to sue,” 1 which is one example we are given of non-jurisdictional standing.\nThe majority opinion is calculated—no, guaranteed—to cause confusion because apparently this\ncourt will henceforth tell litigants on a case-by-case basis whether the standing problems in their\ncases are “jurisdictional” or merely formal.\n\nThere is no need to create this confusion. The majority's fomenting it, however, requires that I\naddress it to some extent. I will discuss the “subject matter never presumed” proposition first, then\nweave into the “jurisdictional standing” language.\n\nI agree that subject matter jurisdiction is never presumed in one respect. Subject matter jurisdiction\nexists when the nature of the case falls within a general category of cases the court is empowered\nto adjudicate under the applicable constitutional and statutory provisions. See Pope v. Ferguson,\n *478 445 S.W.2d 950, 952 (Tex.1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 997, 90 S.Ct. 1138, 25 L.Ed.2d\n405 (1970); Bullock v. Briggs, 623 S.W.2d 508, 511 (Tex.App.—Austin 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.),\ncert. denied, 457 U.S. 1135, 102 S.Ct. 2962, 73 L.Ed.2d 1352 (1982). In this sense, there is no\npresumption because if the case is not one over which the court had constitutional and statutory\nauthority to act one does not “presume” subject matter jurisdiction to make it valid. If a justice of\nthe peace grants a divorce, the judgment is void because that is not the type of case the constitution\nand legislature entrusts to that court, and appellate courts will not “presume” the justice court had\njurisdiction in order to make the judgment valid.\n\nBut what the majority addresses here under the rubric of “standing” is not a court assuming\njurisdiction over a type of dispute for which the statutes do not grant it power. The district court\nundoubtedly had jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment and injunction action brought there,\nsince district courts may entertain declaratory judgment and injunction actions. The question of\nstanding the majority gratuitously addresses here is related to an incidental party issue.\n\nThis court has expressly held that some facts or similar matters relating to party issues are\npresumed. For example, for many years the subject matter jurisdiction for certain trial courts\nas set by the statutes has included a jurisdictional amount, sometimes as a minimum amount in\ncontroversy and sometimes as both a maximum and minimum. Womble v. Atkins, 160 Tex. 363,\n370, 331 S.W.2d 294, 299 (1960). This court has held that jurisdiction, so far as the amount\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   40\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nin controversy is concerned, is determined by the pleadings unless facts disclose that a party\nfraudulently or in bad faith pleaded claims to make it appear there was jurisdiction over the case\nwhere there was not. Brown v. Peters, 127 Tex. 300, 94 S.W.2d 129, 130 (Tex.Comm'n App. B\n1936). Despite the supposed requirement that the pleadings demonstrate jurisdiction, we have also\nheld that unless the pleadings affirmatively show there is no jurisdiction, the court will presume\nthe existence of jurisdiction in the trial court. Peek v. Equipment Serv. Co., 779 S.W.2d 802, 804\n(Tex.1989). 2 This is not the only sense in which subject matter jurisdiction is “presumed” as\nto collateral matters. If a defendant contests jurisdiction and alleges in a verified pleading that\nplaintiff's fraudulent pleading amount was for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction on the trial\ncourt, but the trial judge still renders judgment in the case, on appeal the fact issue of jurisdiction\nis presumed decided against the defendant. Ellis v. Heidrick, 154 S.W.2d 293, 294 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—San Antonio 1941, writ ref'd); see also Maddux v. Booth, 108 S.W.2d 329, 331 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—Amarillo 1937, no writ) (appeal bond from county court to district court did not show filemark\nmaking the appeal timely, held “the absence of such a question being made in the trial court the\npresumption is that the court had jurisdiction”). Further, if the very power of the judge who sits\nis in question, that authority too may be presumed. It is presumed that the assignment of a retired\njudge was properly made pursuant to all statutory requirements absent an express showing to the\ncontrary in the record. Texaco, Inc. v. Pennzoil Co., 729 S.W.2d 768, 855 (Tex.App.—Houston\n[1st Dist.] 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\nThere is a type of lack of standing that this court formerly held to be fundamental error. When there\nwas a joint interest in property involved in the litigation, and the joint owner was not joined as a\nparty, this court earlier held that the party defect was jurisdictional fundamental error that could be\nraised for the first time on appeal. The injustice which that rule caused prompted *479 this court\nto reduce those “indispensable ” necessary parties to near nonexistence. Petroleum Anchor Equip.,\nInc. v. Tyra, 406 S.W.2d 891, 893–94 (Tex.1966); see also Cooper v. Texas Gulf Indus., Inc., 513\nS.W.2d 200, 203 (Tex.1974). It was no accident that this court listed the case which the majority\ntoday overrules, Texas Indus. Traffic League v. Railroad Comm'n, 633 S.W.2d 821 (Tex.1982),\nas one of the cases showing that “[f]undamental or unassigned error is a discredited doctrine”\nas applied to these collateral defect-in-party type claims. Cox v. Johnson, 638 S.W.2d 867, 868\n(Tex.1982). After more than a hundred years of trying to narrow fundamental error exceptions,\nthe majority today takes a quantum leap backward.\n\nIn an appeal of or other direct attack on a trial court default judgment, it is service on the defendant\nand related due process requirements which must affirmatively appear on the record. In such cases\npersonal jurisdiction cannot be presumed. Capitol Brick, Inc. v. Fleming Mfg. Co., 722 S.W.2d\n399, 401 (Tex.1986); Uvalde Country Club v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 690 S.W.2d 884, 885\n(Tex.1985); McKanna v. Edgar, 388 S.W.2d 927, 928 (Tex.1965). Lack of personal jurisdiction\ncan be waived by the party, and personal jurisdiction is presumed in a collateral attack on the\njudgment, whereas error in assuming constitutional or statutory jurisdiction not conferred upon\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   41\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nthe court in question can be neither waived nor ignored. See Crawford v. McDonald, 88 Tex. 626,\n631–32, 33 S.W. 325, 328 (1895). This court has long recognized that there may be party issues,\ni.e., the matter is “a mere matter of procedure” as opposed to the constitutional or statutory power\nof a court to render judgment, that may be presumed as to either type of jurisdiction. Id. at 630,\n33 S.W. at 327.\n\nThe majority should not adopt the federal courts' position that “standing” is jurisdictional. There\nis a fundamental difference between federal law and state law that controls here. Federal courts\nare courts of limited jurisdiction. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 178–79, 2 L.Ed. 60\n(1803). The parties asserting a claim must plead and prove (when not obvious) that jurisdiction\nexists. FED.R.CIV.P. 8(a). A party suing under a statute must establish his right to claim under\nthat statute—his standing —in order to establish jurisdiction. General Comm., Brotherhood of\nLocomotive Eng'rs v. Missouri–Kansas–Texas Ry. Co., 320 U.S. 323, 337–38, 64 S.Ct. 146, 152–\n53, 88 L.Ed. 76 (1943). Consequently, standing is a part of jurisdiction under federal procedure,\nrelated to the “case” or “controversy” requirement of the federal constitution. Association of Data\nProc. Serv. Orgs. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 151, 90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). But\nthere is no “case” or “controversy” limitation language in the Texas Constitution. In state courts of\ngeneral jurisdiction, the power to entertain any suit not prohibited by either the federal constitution\nor federal law is presumed. Cincinnati v. Louisville & N. Ry. Co., 223 U.S. 390, 32 S.Ct. 267,\n56 L.Ed. 481 (1912). State courts have all residual jurisdiction that federal courts lack. Id.; see\ngenerally 2 CHESTER J. ANTIEAU, MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW § 10:1 at 4–5 (1969).\nWe should continue to recognize that “standing,” like other procedural issues, may be waived.\nThere is no reason to overrule the Texas Industrial Traffic League case, or its related progeny.\n\n\nSPECTOR, Justice, concurring and dissenting.\nI agree with the substance of the concurring and dissenting opinion by Justice Doggett. I write\nseparately, however, to explain why I would uphold the statutory requirement that those who\nrun afoul of environmental laws make timely payment of administrative penalties before seeking\njudicial review.\n\nIn two other causes decided today, this court has considered open courts challenges to the statutory\nrequirement that state mineral lessees prepay administrative deficiency assessments before seeking\njudicial review of those assessments. State v. Flag–Redfern Oil Co. and State v. Rutherford Oil\nCorp., 852 S.W.2d 480 (Tex.1993) (considering Tex.Nat.Res.Code § 52.137). Our analysis in\nthose cases focused on the *480 public interest at stake: the State's only interest in the prepayment\nrequirement, we noted, was its financial interest in immediate access to disputed royalty payments.\nId. at 485. Thus, we concluded that the prepayment requirement of section 52.137 was no different,\nin constitutional terms, from the litigation tax disapproved in LeCroy v. Hanlon, 713 S.W.2d 335,\n342 (Tex.1986). Id.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  42\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nThe present case, in contrast, does not involve a litigation tax. The Clean Air Act, the Solid\nWaste Disposal Act, and the Water Quality Act embody this state's commitment to protect the\nenvironment; and the prepayment requirements struck down today were intended to give force\nto that commitment, not to raise revenue. Without the need to prepay administrative penalties,\npolluters will be left with little if any incentive to timely comply with environmental laws and\nregulations.\n\nThe effects of today's decision, though, extend far beyond the statutes at issue in this case. By\nrejecting these prepayment requirements, without regard to the state interest involved, the majority\nhas struck a severe blow to this state's ability to enforce a broad range of regulations in the\npublic interest. The similar statutory provisions identified in the opinion by Justice Doggett, 852\nS.W.2d at 457, cannot be dismissed as minor technicalities; they are carefully-crafted measures\nthat the legislature considered vital to protect the public from recalcitrant lawbreakers. Casting\nthose provisions aside will seriously disrupt the effective operation of our state government.\n\nThe Texas Constitution cannot be construed in absolutes. The basic right of access to the courts\nmust be balanced against the need to protect the public's health and safety. While the restriction at\nissue in this case may be substantial, I would hold that the public's interest in clean air and water,\ncombined with the due process afforded to TAB's members in the administrative process, tips the\nbalance in favor of the prepayment requirement. I therefore dissent.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The League of Women Voters and the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club intervened in the suit and were aligned as defendants with\n        the Texas Air Control Board and the Texas Water Commission. Justice Doggett contends that the standing of the Intervenors should\n        be addressed along with TAB's. We disagree. Standing concerns a party's faculty to invoke the court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n        Once it has been invoked by a plaintiff, a court's subject matter jurisdiction is not affected by the status of defendants or intervenors\n        aligned in interest with defendants.\n2       Act of June 14, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 637, § 33, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 2350, 2359 (amending Texas Clean Air Act codified\n        at TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 4.041 (Vernon 1976), currently codified as amended at TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §\n        382.088; Act of June 15, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 795, § 6.001, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 2719, 2813 (amending Solid Waste Disposal Act\n        codified at TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 4477–7 (Vernon 1976), currently codified as amended at TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY\n        CODE § 361.252; Act of June 15, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 795, § 5.007, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 2719, 2806 (amending TEX.WATER\n        CODE § 26.136).\n3       Although some amendments have been adopted since, they are not relevant to the issue presented in this case. See Diana C. Dutton,\n        ENVIRONMENTAL, 45 SW. L.J. 389 (1991) (summarizing statutory developments).\n4       “An appeal may be taken directly to the supreme court from an order of a trial court granting or denying an interlocutory or permanent\n        injunction on the ground of the constitutionality of a statute of this state.” TEX.GOV'T CODE § 22.001(c).\n5       Justice Doggett confuses subject matter jurisdiction with personal jurisdiction. Only the latter can be waived when uncontested. See\n        TEX.R.CIV.P. 120a.\n6       The analysis is the same under the federal constitution. See e.g. Correspondence of the Justices, Letter from Chief Justice John Jay\n        and the Associate Justices to President George Washington, August 8, 1793 in Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 73\n        n. 3 (2nd ed. 1988).\n7       Of the states listed by Justice Doggett, only Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, New York, South Dakota, and perhaps Ohio, Pennsylvania and\n        Washington actually treat jurisdictional standing as waivable. See 852 S.W.2d at 469. The other state cases cited deal with the waiver\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

City of West Palm Beach, 255 So.2d 673, 675 (Fla.1971) (addressing capacity objection).\n8     Justice Doggett disagrees that standing is a component of subject matter jurisdiction, yet he declines to explain what role standing\n      plays in our jurisprudence. From his harsh critique of the doctrine, it seems that he not only objects to the conclusion that standing\n      cannot be waived but also to the conclusion that standing is a requirement to initiate a lawsuit.\n9     Texas Industrial Traffic League relied on two cases to support its holding that standing cannot be raised for the first time on appeal:\n      Coffee v. William Marsh Rice University, 403 S.W.2d 340, 341 (Tex.1966), and Sabine River Authority v. Willis, 369 S.W.2d 348,\n      350 (Tex.1963). We need not overrule these two cases, however, because unlike Texas Industrial Traffic League, we believe that\n      standing was present in the trial court in these cases. Our concern is with a party's right to initiate a lawsuit and the trial court's\n      corresponding power to hear the case ab initio. Standing is determined at the time suit is filed in the trial court, and subsequent events\n      do not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction. Carr, 931 F.2d at 1061.\n10    Justice Doggett claims that we overrule three additional decisions of this court. See Central Educ. Agency v. Burke, 711 S.W.2d 7\n      (Tex.1986) (per curiam); American Gen. Fire & Casualty Co. v. Weinberg, 639 S.W.2d 688 (Tex.1982); Cox v. Johnson, 638 S.W.2d\n      867 (Tex.1982) (per curiam). We disagree. These cases hold that matters not raised in the trial court are waived. One exception noted\n      by these decisions, however, is a lack of jurisdiction which may be raised by a party, or the court, for the first time on appeal. Justice\n      Doggett does not believe that standing falls within that exception because he contends that standing is not jurisdictional.\n11    In most other jurisdictions, such prepayment provisions are required only to stay execution of judgments and are not prerequisites\n      to the right to appeal itself. See Gary Stein, Expanding the Due Process Rights of Indigent Litigants: Will Texaco Trickle Down?,\n      61 N.Y.U.L. REV. 463, 469 (1986).\n12    Thus, contrary to Justice Doggett's reading of our opinion, the Sax test is inapplicable.\n\n13    The Clean Air Act was implemented to “safeguard the state's air resources from pollution by controlling or abating air pollution\n      and emissions of air contaminants....” TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.002(a). The Texas Water Code was implemented to\n      “maintain the quality of water in the state consistent with the public health and enjoyment ...” TEX.WATER CODE § 26.003.\n14    The importance is evidenced by article XVI, section 59(a) of our constitution, which provides in relevant part that: “The conservation\n      and development of all the natural resources of this State ... and the preservation and conservation of all such natural resources ... are\n      each and all ... public rights and duties.” TEX. CONST. art. XVI, § 59(a).\n15    If the person charged does not make payment or post bond within thirty days, the agency may forward the matter to the attorney\n      general for enforcement. TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.089(c), § 361.252(m); TEX.WATER CODE § 26.136(k).\n16    It has been argued that our procedure of allowing immediate enforcement of trial court judgments violates federal due process when\n      the judgment debtor is financially unable to post a supersedeas bond and immediate enforcement will cause irreparable injury. Texaco,\n      Inc. v. Pennzoil Co., 784 F.2d 1133 (2d Cir.1986), rev'd on other grounds, 481 U.S. 1, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 95 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987). A similar\n      argument could be fashioned under the Texas open courts provision, but TAB does not assert that argument here. TAB's open courts\n      challenge centers not on the requirement of immediate payment, but on the forfeiture of judicial review if payment is not made.\n17    Thus, contrary to Justice Doggett's assertion, we do not strike down the penalties themselves. Nothing in this opinion prohibits the\n      state's collection of assessed penalties. We hold as violative of our open courts provision only the requirement that the penalties be\n      paid as a condition to judicial review. Furthermore, nothing in our opinion requires that penalties already paid be refunded.\n18    That the affected parties may be able to afford prepayment is irrelevant. The guarantee of constitutional rights should not depend\n      on the balance in one's bank account.\n19    TAB claims that the lack of a jury trial before the agency as well as the lack of a trial de novo violate article I, section 15. We limit\n      our inquiry to the absence of a trial de novo because, as this court has said: “Trial by jury cannot be claimed in an inquiry that is non-\n      judicial in its character, or with respect to proceedings before an administrative board.” Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., 108\n      Tex. 96, 185 S.W. 556, 561–62 (1916). Even if the right to a jury is denied before an administrative agency, the dispositive question\n      is whether a trial de novo and the corresponding right to a jury trial is constitutionally required upon judicial review of the agency's\n      decision. See Cockrill v. Cox, 65 Tex. 669, 674 (1886) (“The right of jury trial remains inviolate, though denied in the court of first\n      instance [in civil cases], if the right to appeal and the jury trial on appeal are secured.”) (bracketed language in original).\n20    Article I, section 15, provides, in pertinent part:\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See 852 S.W.2d\n      at 461.\n23    Despite Justice Doggett's trumpeting of our constitution's guarantee of trial by jury, he agrees that the right does not attach under\n      the circumstances of this case.\n24    Justice Doggett contends that the basis for our jury trial holding is overbroad. Instead, he would have us adopt the “imperfectly\n      employed” federal test first enunciated in Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n, 430 U.S. 442, 97 S.Ct.\n      1261, 51 L.Ed.2d 464 (1977). Infra, 852 S.W.2d at 464. The basis for our decision is more limited, arising as it does out of TEX.\n      CONST. article XVI, section 59(a) and our decision in Corzelius.\n25    The Clean Air Act proclaims:\n            The policy of this state and the purpose of this chapter to safeguard the air resources of the state from pollution by controlling\n            or abating air pollution and emissions of air contaminants, consistent with the protection of public health, general welfare, and\n            physical property of the people, including the aesthetic enjoyment of air resources by the public and the maintenance of adequate\n            visibility.\n            TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.002.\n            The Texas Water Code proclaims in relevant part:\n            It is the policy of this state and the purpose of the subchapter to maintain the quality of water in the state consistent with the\n            public health and enjoyment\n      .....\n            TEX.WATER CODE § 26.003.\n26    The actions of the agencies involved in this proceeding are subject to the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (APTRA),\n      which specifically affords a “full panoply of procedural safeguards” to a party to contested case before those agencies. Southwestern\n      Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Tex., 571 S.W.2d 503, 507 (Tex.1978). These procedural safeguards include the right to\n      notice, the making of a full record of the proceeding before the agency, the taking of depositions, the right to subpoena witnesses,\n      the application of the rules of evidence, the preparation of proposal for decision and the filing of exceptions and briefs, as well as\n      separately stated findings of fact and conclusions of law. TEX.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 6252–13a § 19 (Vernon Supp.1993). Judicial\n      review is provided by section 19(e) under the substantial evidence rule, which directs a reviewing court to reverse and remand the\n      agency adjudication if the agency decision is:\n            1) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\n            2) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\n            3) made upon unlawful procedure;\n            4) affected by other error of law;\n            5) not reasonably supported by substantial evidence in view of the reliable and probative evidence in the record as a whole; or\n            6) arbitrary and capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n         Id.\n         We have held that judicial review under APTRA based on the record developed before the agency “furnishes more assurance of\n         due process and a surer means of determining whether an agency acted arbitrarily, capriciously and without due regard for the\n         evidence.” Imperial Am.

The guarantee extends to any “cause” instituted in the district court. A\n            “cause” is defined as a suit or action concerning any question, civil or criminal, contested before a court of justice.\n         See Texas Constitutional Revision Commission, A New Constitution for Texas: Text, Explanation, Commentary 120–21 (1973).\n36    The Credit Bureau opinion was authored for the court by now former Chief Justice Jack Pope, who had written previously, “[t]he\n      struggle for survival by the institution we call the jury is truly the epic of our law.” Jack Pope, The Jury, 39 Tex.L.Rev. 426 (1961).\n      That struggle continues today.\n37    Though he wrote in unnecessarily global terms regarding this exception, even Harris recognized that\n            [t]he plain language of the Judiciary section conferring the right of trial by jury in all causes in the district courts would seem to\n            entitle parties to jury trials irrespective of whether that right existed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.\n         Harris, supra, at 6–7.\n38    The majority notes the existence of other statutory procedural protections, such as those contained in the Administrative Procedure\n      and Texas Register Act, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat. art. 6252–13a, § 19(e). 852 S.W.2d at 452, n. 26. While important, these measures certainly\n      do not constitute a complete substitute for a jury trial. If the Texas Constitution guarantees a right to trial by jury, no lesser protection\n      will suffice.\n39    To some extent every action legislatively entrusted to an administrative agency involves a public right. At the same time even actions\n      by private parties may have incidental regulatory effects and are unquestionably invested with a public interest. See The Dallas\n      Morning News, Inc. v. Fifth Court of Appeals, 842 S.W.2d 655, 663 (Tex.1992, orig. proceeding) (Doggett, J., dissenting from\n      overruling of motion for leave to file petition for writ of mandamus).\n40    The “public rights” concept has been recently muddled by the federal courts. In Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 109\n      S.Ct. 2782, 106 L.Ed.2d 26 (1989), the court, although upholding the right to a jury trial for defendants sued for fraudulent conveyance\n      by a trustee in bankruptcy, broadened the scope of its “public rights” exception to include all cases “involving statutory rights that\n      are integral parts of a public regulatory scheme and whose adjudication Congress has assigned to an administrative agency.” Id. at\n      55 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. at 2797 n. 10.

I\n      believe that such an expansive reading of “public rights” would not be consistent with the broad state constitutional protection of\n      the right to trial by jury in Texas.\n41    In view of recent attacks nationwide on the jury system, a recent study determined that\n            Our central conclusion is that the civil jury system is valuable and works well.... It is [not] “broken,” and therefore it need not\n            be “fixed.” The jury system is a proven, effective, an important means of resolving civil disputes.\n         The Brookings Institution, Charting a Future for the Civil Jury System 2 (1992).\n42    As the majority recognizes, “the parties insist that any question of standing has been waived in the trial court and cannot be raised\n      by the court for the first time on appeal.” 852 S.W.2d at 443–444.\n43    Despite the clear statement in Sabine River that “[w]e assume without deciding that Sabine has no justiciable interest,” 369 S.W.2d\n      at 349, the majority today asserts that “standing was present” in the trial court in that case. 852 S.W.2d at 446 n. 9.\n44    See, e.g., Espiricueta v.

The majority's odd attempt to distinguish some of these cases, all of which are\n      predicated in terms of standing, as involving solely the question of whether the litigant was a proper “real party in interest” has never\n      been drawn previously in the published decisions of any Texas court addressing the question of standing. See cases cited at notes\n      44, supra, and 50, infra.\n50    See Texas Industrial Traffic League, 633 S.W.2d at 822–23; Central Educ. Agency v.

To avoid overruling these, the majority claims\n      all three recognized that lack of subject matter jurisdiction can initially be raised on appeal. True, but ignored is the conclusion of\n      each that subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived while standing can be.\n51    Our past acknowledgement of the legislative power to expand access to Texas courts is inconsistent with today's conclusion that\n      we must narrowly limit access.

City of San Antonio, 155 Tex. 111, 114, 283 S.W.2d 722, 724 (1955). The majority overrules the Texas\n      Industrial Traffic League case, which addressed standing in the context of “justiciable interest” discussed in the more recent cases\n      of Coffee v. William Marsh Rice University, 403 S.W.2d 340 (Tex.1966), and Sabine River Authority v. Willis, 369 S.W.2d 348\n      (Tex.1963). The context of the cases differed from Board of Water Engineers, of course. The precise meaning of “standing” in fact\n      depends on the context. The majority adopts a federal gloss, and the federal courts have stated, “Generalizations about standing to\n      sue are largely worthless as such.” Association of Data Proc. Serv. Orgs. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 151, 90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d\n      184 (1970). Using “standing” to mean a party's legal capacity to sue is my best description of the labyrinth of different cases the\n      majority uses interchangeably.\n2     Richardson v. First Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 419 S.W.2d 836 (Tex.1967), relied upon by the majority for the proposition that pleadings\n      must “affirmatively show that the court has jurisdiction to hear the cause,” 852 S.W.2d at 446, was expressly distinguished in Peek.\n      This unanimous opinion written for the Court by Chief Justice Phillips explained that Richardson really meant that if the pleadings\n      affirmatively showed there was no jurisdiction, then the case should be dismissed, but otherwise there was a presumption that the\n      amount omitted from the pleading would support jurisdiction.

Customer appealed.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, Evelyn V. Keyes, J., held that:\n\n[1] REP conclusively established its right to recover over $105,000 from customer for breach of\nESA;\n\n[2] customer was not excused from performance of ESA by REP's use of estimated billing;\n\n[3] it was impossible to determine the actual harm that would have been caused to REP by\ncustomer's early termination, as required for liquidated damages clause to be enforceable;\n\n[4] when viewed as of the time the ESA was executed, ESA's method for calculating liquidated\ndamages was reasonable;\n\n[5] early termination fee in ESA did not violate statute;\n\n[6] attorney's affidavit in support of attorney fees award was sufficient to support claims such that\nREP was entitled to statutory presumption that fees were reasonable; and\n\n[7] excessive demand exception to REP's statutory right to attorney fees did not apply.\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(collectively, “Triton”),\nappeal the trial court's grant of summary judgment and a receivership order entered in favor of\nappellee, Star Electricity, L.L.C. d/b/a StarTex Power (“StarTex”). Triton presents fourteen issues\nfor appellate consideration. In its first seven issues, Triton argues that (1) the trial court erred in\ngranting summary judgment in favor of StarTex on its breach of contract claim because (2) the\ntrial court misinterpreted and misapplied the law applicable to the claims and defenses asserted\nby the parties; (3) StarTex's summary judgment evidence did not establish that it was entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law on its breach of contract claim; (4) Triton's summary judgment\nevidence raised genuine issues of material fact as to one or more elements of StarTex's breach of\ncontract claim; (5) genuine issues of material fact existed as to Triton's claims for offset and credit\nbased on StarTex's use of improper and incorrect billing and StarTex's use of estimated billing; (6)\ngenuine issues of material fact existed as to StarTex's billing practices and procedures and whether\nthose procedures constituted a breach by StarTex of the parties' contract; and (7) genuine issues\nof material fact existed regarding whether Triton objected *47 to StarTex's billing practices and\nprocedures and to invoices submitted to Triton by StarTex and whether StarTex failed to fulfill its\nlegal obligations for handling such complaints.\n\nTriton further argues that (8) StarTex's failure to comply with the legal requirements for handling\ncomplaints concerning retail electric service and Triton's pending complaint against StarTex\nbefore the Texas Public Utility Commission acted to stay the judgment and enforcement of the\njudgment. Triton attacks the trial court's damages award, arguing that the trial court erred in\nawarding StarTex (9) liquidated damages pursuant to the early termination provisions in the\ncontract because such an award constitutes an impermissible and unenforceable penalty; (10)\nearly termination fee damages based on unidentified and unproven monthly billings; (11) early\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Finally, Triton appeals the order of the\ntrial court appointing a receiver, arguing that (13) the trial court erred in appointing a receiver\nand ordering Triton to turn over to the receiver confidential records and all proceeds and revenue\ngenerated by Triton's businesses and that (14) Triton is entitled to immediate relief from the order\nappointing a receiver and is entitled to recover all records and revenue turned over pursuant to\nthe order, including all funds that have been disbursed, paid, relinquished, distributed, or in any\nway disposed of by the receiver.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n\n\n                                                      Background\n\nTexas deregulated its electric utility market beginning in 1999. See TEX. UTIL.CODE ANN. §\n39.051(a) (Vernon 2007) (“On or before September 1, 2000, each electric utility shall separate\nfrom its regulated utility activities its customer energy services business activities that are\notherwise also widely available in the competitive market.”); Tex. Indus. Energy Consumers v.\nCenterPoint Energy Houston Elec., LLC, 324 S.W.3d 95, 97 (Tex.2010). The Utilities Code\nprovides that electric utilities must separate their business activities from one another into three\nunits: (1) a power generation company; (2) a retail electric provider; and (3) a transmission and\ndistribution utility. TEX. UTIL.CODE ANN. § 39.051(b).\n\nRetail electric providers, like StarTex, essentially buy electricity from a transmission and\ndistribution utility and resell it to Texas consumers. See AEP Tex. N. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm'n\nof Tex., 297 S.W.3d 435, 439 (Tex.App.-Austin 2009, pet. denied) (citing Tex. Util.Code Ann.\n§ 39.051). The transmission and distribution utility's rates are still regulated by the Texas Public\nUtility Commission (“PUC”). Tex. Indus. Energy Consumers, 324 S.W.3d at 97. Transmission and\ndistribution utilities provide metering services, charge retail electric providers for “nonbypassable\ndelivery charges” under rates approved by the PUC, and may also bill retail customers directly\nat the request of the retail provider. Id. at 97–98. Thus, Texas's electric utilities have “voluntarily\ninterconnected their transmission systems” to form a single grid managed by the Electric\nReliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”). Pub. Util. Comm'n of Tex. v. City Pub. Serv. Bd. of\nSan Antonio, 53 S.W.3d 310, 312 (Tex.2001). Electricity is produced by a generating facility,\ntransmitted to a point of interconnection with the ERCOT grid, *48 and then distributed to end\nusers who purchase it from retail electric providers.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nIt is in this context that Triton, as owner of five commercial buildings, entered into an Electric\nServices Agreement (“ESA”) in May 2006 with StarTex, a retail electricity provider. StarTex\nagreed to supply Triton with electricity, and Triton agreed to pay at a fixed rate for a term of twelve\nmonths. Regarding invoicing and payment, the ESA provided that\n\n             [StarTex] shall render to Customer [Triton] on a monthly basis, or as mutually\n             agreed by [StarTex] and Customer but not less frequent than monthly, an invoice\n             that is due and payable fifteen (15) days from the date of the invoice. If the\n             payment of all undisputed amounts is not received by the due date, Customer\n             will be charged a late fee equal to five percent (5%) of the past due amount.\n             Customer must provide to [StarTex] written notice setting forth in particular\n             detail any disputed amount, including the calculations with respect to any errors\n             or inaccuracies claimed. If it is subsequently determined that Customer owes\n             [StarTex] any portion of the disputed amount, Customer shall remit to [StarTex]\n             within five (5) business days following such resolution the outstanding balance\n             plus interest .... Any amounts that may have been overpaid or underpaid shall\n             be applied to the next monthly invoice.\n\nThe ESA also contained the following language:\n\n   Early Termination Fee. In the event that Customer terminates this agreement or Customer\n   defaults as described [below], then an Early Termination Fee will be assessed. The Early\n   Termination Fee shall be equal to the greater of a) the three months highest bills for Customer or\n   b) any mark to market costs. For purposes of this fee the mark to market costs shall be calculated\n   by multiplying the difference between the initial cost of power procured to satisfy the ESA and\n   the final net liquidated value of said power at the time of termination by the total amount of\n   power procured from the Customer Location for the remainder of the original term of the ESA....\n\n   ....\n\n   Customer Acknowledgments.

Triton elected to replace the fixed-rate pricing schedule with\nthe Market Clearing Price of Energy *49 (“MCPE”). The First Amendment provided:\n\n   1. PRICE FOR ENERGY: The term for this Amendment shall commence upon the Customer's\n   normal meter read during the month of May 2007, and continue through the Customer's normal\n   meter read during the month of May 2008. Customer agrees to purchase electricity from\n   STARTEX at a variable rate based on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”)'s\n   Balancing Energy price (“Contract Price”) for the Congestion Zone in which the Customer's\n   location resides. The price calculated by ERCOT in the market for Balancing Energy is referred\n   to as the Market Clearing Price for Energy (“MCPE”) in the ERCOT protocols....\n\n   2. Except as herein changed and amended, the Agreement [ESA] shall remain in full force and\n   effect as written. Any changes made in this Amendment that are disputed by Customer will be\n   replaced by the original Agreement's terms and conditions.\n\nIn 2008, the parties again extended their agreement under the MCPE pricing terms for a term of\nthirty-six months (“Second Amendment”). The Second Amendment contained language identical\nto that in the First Amendment, except that the term of the Second Amendment commenced “upon\nthe Customer's normal meter read during the month of May 2008 and continued through the\nCustomer's normal meter read during the month of May 2011.”\n\nTriton objected to some of StarTex's billing practices. This eventually led to Triton's terminating\nits contract with StarTex in October 2008 and seeking electricity from a different retail electricity\nprovider.\n\nOn September 14, 2009, StarTex filed suit against Triton alleging breach of contract, and, in\nthe alternative, suit on a sworn account and quantum meruit. StarTex asserted that Triton owed\nit $319,094.11, consisting of unpaid utility service and contractual fees, interest, and liquidated\ndamages. StarTex also sought attorney's fees under Civil Practice and Remedies Code chapter\n38. StarTex attached to its petition an affidavit from Robert Verhage, its Collections Manager,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Triton generally denied StarTex's allegations and asserted\nthat the liquidated damages provision was invalid and unenforceable and that the attorney's fees\nsought were not reasonable and necessary.\n\nTriton also asserted that\n\n             the account on which [StarTex] sues ... is not just and true, and all just and\n             lawful offsets, payments, and credits have not been applied to [Triton's] account.\n             [Triton] does not owe [StarTex] $319,094.11 in damages, because [StarTex]\n             seeks to recover $197,323.95 in damages based on an invalid liquidated damages\n             provision. Furthermore, based on the inaccuracies in [StarTex's] billing and\n             estimates since 2007, [Triton] also challenge[s] [StarTex's] allegation that [it\n             owes] $105,034.18 to [StarTex] for services rendered.\n\nAttached to its answer, Triton provided the affidavit of Bill Bird, who averred:\n\n             I am responsible for and have knowledge of Triton's business dealings with\n             Plaintiff [StarTex]. Triton began doing business with Plaintiff in 2006. In the\n             summer of 2007, Plaintiff began providing usage estimates to Triton, which\n             reflected very high usage. Triton brought this issue to Plaintiff's attention,\n             and the *50 issue was not resolved. Triton contests the validity of Plaintiff's\n             account, and denies that it owes $105,034.18 to Plaintiff for services rendered.\n\nOn January 20, 2010, StarTex moved for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim.\nStarTex argued that the parties had a valid contract and that the First and Second Amendments of\nthe contract required Triton to pay for the electricity received under the MCPE pricing schedule\nthrough May 2011. Copies of the ESA and First and Second Amendments were attached as\nsummary judgment evidence. StarTex stated that “[t]he MCPE is a variable rate plan wherein the\nprice changes every fifteen (15) minutes to reflect the supply and demand for power in a particular\nmarket.”\n\nStarTex argued,\n\n             Due to the numerous price changes involved in an MCPE contract, StarTex\n             had to customize its purchase to fit the particular consumption needs of Triton.\n             Every customer's consumption needs differ, and StarTex must carefully time\n             its purchases so that it has sufficient power for the customer during their peak\n             usage hours and so that it does not over-purchase during down times. This is\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                6\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\n             referred to in the industry as the “shape” of a particular customer, and like a\n             fingerprint, no two customers have an identical “shape.” Triton's meters are\n             located at commercial office buildings, and therefore, the “shape” of StarTex's\n             purchase was designed to accommodate heavy usage from the hours of 8:00 a.m.\n             to 5:00 p.m., with a slight decrease during the lunch hour, and minimal usage for\n             the remaining hours of the day. Therefore, in order to service Triton's Contract,\n             not only did StarTex commit to purchase sufficient power to cover the life of\n             the Contract, but it also committed to make purchases every fifteen (15) minutes\n             that mirror the kWh used by Triton during each fifteen (15) minute interval.\n\nThis argument was supported by the affidavit of Stephen Madden, the Senior Vice–President of\nSupply for StarTex.\n\nStarTex asserted that it provided power to Triton throughout the term of the contract and submitted\ninvoices to Triton “based on meter reads performed by CenterPoint Energy (“CenterPoint”), the\nTransmission and/or Distribution Services Provider (“TDSP”) for the Houston area.” StarTex\nfurther argued that:\n\n             On several occasions, StarTex was required to generate [Triton's] monthly\n             invoice using estimated reads based on historical usage. This was a result of\n             CenterPoint being unable to gain access to [Triton's] meters to obtain the actual\n             usage amounts. All such estimated reads were reconciled on subsequent invoices\n             once CenterPoint obtained access to the meters, such that the final invoice\n             reflected only actual usage. All estimated reads and subsequent reconciliations\n             were detailed on [Triton's] monthly invoices.\n\nStarTex provided invoices and the affidavit of Robert Verhage, the Director of Credit and\nCollections for StarTex, substantiating these arguments. Verhage averred that the invoices\nattached as summary judgment evidence were true and correct copies of Triton's monthly invoices.\nVerhage testified that, after Triton terminated the ESA on approximately October 19, 2008,\n“StarTex generated one final invoice that contained the final, outstanding balance that was\nreconciled to correct all estimated reads.” The final invoice reflected that Triton owed $155,034.18,\nand Verhage averred that Triton subsequently made $50,000.00 in payments, leaving $105,034.18\ndue and owing. Thus, StarTex argued that Triton breached the ESA *51 when it failed to pay for\n$105,034.18 worth of electricity provided under the ESA and subsequent amendments.\n\nStarTex also asserted that Triton breached the ESA when it terminated the ESA early. StarTex\nstated in its motion, and Madden averred in his affidavit, that when StarTex entered into the Second\nAmendment extending the terms of the ESA through May 2011, it contracted with the electricity\nproducer “to purchase enough power to service the entire thirty-six (36) month term of the Second\nAmendment and the purchases were tailored to fit Triton's particular ‘shape’.” Thus, the ESA\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\ncontained a liquidated damages clause for early termination of the contract which entitled StarTex\nto $197,323.95 in liquidated damages after Triton unilaterally terminated the contract on October\n10, 2008, approximately thirty-one months before the contract term was set to expire in May 2011.\n\nStarTex argued, based on Madden's statements in his affidavit, that this early termination clause\nwas a valid liquidated damages provision because, “[i]n the case of an MCPE contract, it is\nimpossible to calculate the total damages that stem from an early termination until the term of the\nbreached contract has expired and StarTex has been able to complete its attempts at mitigating\nthe damages.” StarTex argued that it “must continue to purchase Triton's power from its supplier\nuntil May of 2011” and that it was required to “purchase this power in Triton's particular ‘shape’\n” even though StarTex did not have another customer to sell it to because StarTex “would have\nto find a new customer who not only wants an MCPE contract, but has the exact same term and\nvolume requirements and ‘shape’ as Triton.” StarTex thus calculated its liquidated damages as\n$197,323.25, based on the sum of Triton's three highest monthly bills because the mark-to-market\nlosses were incapable of calculation until May 2011.\n\nFinally, StarTex argued that it was entitled to attorney's fees on its breach of contract claim. It\nargued that, under its fee agreement with its counsel, it would incur attorney's fees “in an amount\nequal to twenty-five percent (25%) of all amounts recovered from [Triton],” or $75,589.36, and\nthat this amount was reasonable and necessary. The summary judgment motion was accompanied\nby the affidavit of Rodney Drinnon, counsel for StarTex, who averred to the specific services\nprovided by his firm and stated that the services described were reasonable and necessary and that\n“twenty-five percent (25%) is a reasonable contingency fee for the services provided.”\n\nOn January 28, 2010, Triton amended its answer, adding claims that StarTex “materially breached\nthe contract, which was modified by agreement,” that Triton “complied with the terms of the\nmodified contract,” that Triton was “discharged from performing under the contract after [StarTex]\nmaterially breached same,” and that StarTex failed “to mitigate its damages as required under\napplicable law, limitation of warranty, limitation of liability, laches, and waiver.” Triton also\nsought a continuance of the summary judgment hearing, which the trial court granted.\n\nOn April 5, 2010, Triton responded to StarTex's summary judgment motion. Triton did not contest\nStarTex's statements that the ESA and subsequent amendments were valid contracts. However,\nTriton asserted that StarTex “made several promises to [Triton] and [orally] modified the terms of\nthe parties' agreements.” Triton argued that Michael Gary, Triton's property manager, “had several\ndiscussions with John Bejger, a representative of StarTex, relating to StarTex's estimated usage\nand Triton's disputes over *52 the StarTex invoices.” As supported by Gary's affidavit in Triton's\nsummary judgment evidence, Gary represented to Bejger that the practice of estimating electricity\nusage for several consecutive months was causing damage to Triton because Triton could not\nbill its tenants based on estimated billing. Gary also averred that Triton had “done everything\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               8\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nin its power” to give CenterPoint access to the meters and that Triton would not continue the\nbusiness relationship with StarTex “if the estimations and errors in billing continued on a month\nto month basis.” Gary further averred that Bejger represented that the errors would be corrected,\nthat StarTex was attempting to resolve the allegations that CenterPoint did not have access to\nTriton's meters, and “that StarTex's previous practice of estimating usage of consecutive months\nwould not continue.” Gary stated that Triton entered into the Second Amendment based on these\nrepresentations by Bejger. Triton's response asserted that Gary's affidavit about his discussions\nwith Bejger raised a disputed issue of material fact as to whether there was a meeting of the minds\nin reaching a valid modification.\n\nTriton also argued that it was excused from performing under the ESA based on StarTex's material\nbreach of the agreements “when it failed to provide [Triton] with accurate and correct billings for\nthe electricity that it actually delivered.” Triton's motion referenced the invoices sent by StarTex\nand provided details regarding which specific invoices were based on estimated usage, including\nseveral instances in which it was invoiced based on estimated usage in consecutive months.\n\nTriton presented Gary's affidavit, averring that Gary first contacted StarTex to resolve the\nbilling problems during the original term of the ESA and that StarTex responded by saying\nthat CenterPoint could not access and read the electricity meters in Triton's buildings. Triton\nincluded in its summary judgment evidence various e-mails between Gary and StarTex in which\nGary raised questions and disputes over the amounts billed in the invoices and StarTex provided\ninformation reconciling its charges. Gary's e-mails did not contain any specific calculations or\namounts with regard to the alleged errors or inaccuracies. StarTex's e-mail reflects that it sent\nTriton a spreadsheet demonstrating how StarTex reconciled the bills and comparing Triton's\nusage and rates. Triton also included an e-mail from CenterPoint to StarTex, received in response\nto StarTex's inquiry regarding the difficulty of getting actual meter readings. The CenterPoint\nrepresentative stated,\n\n             I disagree that CenterPoint is at fault for the estimations. Triton does not provide\n             us unencumbered, permanent, ongoing access to our meters. The estimation\n             reasons are specific to each address, but on some accounts Triton has their meters\n             locked inside a mechanical room to which we're supposed to go track down\n             an employee and a key, apparently unsuccessfully at times, perhaps because\n             the right employee can't be found. On other accounts, we're supposed to enter\n             through a locked gate where the gate code we have on record has been changed.\n             Triton has a responsibility to keep us updated if access arrangements change.\n\nTriton's summary judgment evidence also included the affidavit of Jim Phillips, the Vice President\nof IEA Engineering, an energy engineering company. Phillips stated that he reviewed StarTex's\nbilling invoices and Triton's historical electricity usage. He averred that he found\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\n\n   various and repeated errors and irregularities in the billings for the Triton *53 buildings. These\n   errors include, without limitation:\n\n   • several errors in math (multiplication of energy consumption by the cost of energy);\n\n   • excessive estimated energy readings;\n\n   • estimated energy readings at one site (meter) while the next site (meter) was actually read in\n      the same month, again repeatedly;\n\n   • three meters had a monthly load factor greater than 100%, which is an impossibility (LF is\n      the maximum demand used over hours of the month—over 100% is more hours than in that\n      month);\n\n   • several examples where the ending energy reading of one month did not match the beginning\n      reading of the next month;\n\n   • energy costs are not consistent across meters in the same month;\n\n   • multiple corrections from earlier months' estimated energy reading make analysis difficult; and\n\n   • it is improbable that back to back months would have the same exact energy consumption\n      readings and that demand would remain the same for several months in a row.\n\nPhillips provided his opinion about other errors and problems with StarTex's billing practices,\nwithout providing specific contested amounts, and concluded:\n\n             In summary, the total value of the errors I analyzed came to almost $97,000.00.\n             This is not an inclusive value and with additional time to review the invoices\n             and billing, this amount should significantly increase. The numbers and values\n             I used assume that StarTex's numbers were correct; however, I found that some\n             of these numbers and values were not correct when compared to each other. To\n             this amount and the other uncalculated errors, taxes must be added since they\n             are a percentage of the energy and [TDSP] charges. The error value is therefore\n             compounded.\n\nThus, Triton argued that it “created a fact issue on each element of [its] affirmative defense” of\nprior material breach and that it raised a fact issue regarding whether StarTex conclusively proved\nthe proper amount of damages.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nTriton further responded to StarTex's summary judgment motion by arguing that StarTex violated\nthe ESA “by estimating Triton's electricity usage for no apparent justifiable reasons” and by\nestimating Triton's usage over consecutive months.\n\nTriton also argued that summary judgment on the liquidated damages issue was not proper\n“because (1) a reasonable basis for estimating just compensation in an event of default does exist\nunder the circumstances, and (2) there are factual issues that must be resolved before the legal\nquestion of liquidated damages is determined.” Finally, Triton argued that StarTex was not entitled\nto recover attorney's fees because it “made an excessive demand on [Triton] before filing its\nlawsuit.”\n\nTriton also objected to Drinnon's affidavit, arguing that it “wholly fails to describe the time that\nwas required and expended in prosecuting [StarTex's] claim, the hourly rate usually charged by\n[StarTex's] counsel, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved in this lawsuit, and the\nskill required to perform the legal service properly under the circumstances.” Triton also objected\nbecause Drinnon's affidavit was not supported by any documents other than the engagement letter.\n\nOn April 13, 2010, StarTex replied to Triton's response. StarTex presented the affidavit of John\nBejger, contesting Gary's representations that the parties entered *54 into an oral modification\nof their agreement. StarTex also argued that, “because the TDSP [CenterPoint], not StarTex, is\nsolely authorized by the State of Texas to provide actual and estimated readings [,] Bejger would\nnot have made” any representations regarding discontinuing the use of estimated meter readings in\nthe monthly invoices. Finally, StarTex argued that the parties entered into the Second Amendment\nafter the alleged oral representations and thus Triton's argument that Texas law allows modification\nof a written agreement by later oral representations was inapplicable.\n\nStarTex also argued that it did not breach the ESA. Specifically, StarTex argued that Phillips,\nTriton's energy engineer expert, did not specifically identify any breach by StarTex. StarTex\nargued that it was permitted by the ESA and Texas law to bill Triton based on estimated usage;\nthat, under the terms of the ESA, it is irrelevant why CenterPoint provided Triton's estimated usage\nrather than actual usage; and that Triton did not follow the contractual provisions requiring it to\npay undisputed portions of the invoice and to set forth in detail “calculations with respect to any\nerrors or inaccuracies claims.”\n\nStarTex again argued that the liquidated damages provision was enforceable. Finally, StarTex\nargued that its original demand to Triton was not excessive, and thus that ground did not preclude\nit from recovering attorney's fees.\n\nOn April 16, 2010, following the summary judgment hearing, Triton filed its “Supplemental\nResponse” to StarTex's summary judgment motion. StarTex objected to the supplemental response\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.              11\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v.

Triton also\nobjected to the affidavit of John Bejger, attached to StarTex's reply to Triton's response.\n\nOn April 26, 2010, the trial court granted StarTex's motion. The trial court's order stated that it\nconsidered “the Motion, the response, the pleadings, the affidavits, other evidence on file with\nthe Court, and arguments of counsel.” The trial court awarded StarTex $105,034.18 “as actual\ndamages for [Triton's] failure to pay for electricity provided by [StarTex].” The trial court awarded\nStarTex $197,323.25 “as liquidated damages for [Triton's] early termination of the [ESA].”\nFinally, the trial court awarded StarTex $12,000 as reasonable and necessary attorney's fees, as\nwell as additional attorney's fees conditioned on an unsuccessful appeal by Triton.\n\nOn May 12, 2010, StarTex moved for a turnover order.\n\nOn May 25, 2010, Triton moved for reconsideration or a new trial. Triton supported this motion\nwith new affidavits from Jim Phillips, Michael Gary, and Montague Morgan, attorney for Triton,\nwho attempted to authenticate documents attached to Phillips' affidavit. StarTex objected to and\nmoved to strike these affidavits on the ground that Triton did not timely file them and on the\nground that Gary's affidavit was not based on his personal knowledge and was made in bad faith.\nThe trial court granted StarTex's motion and struck the affidavits of Phillips, Gary, and Morgan\nthat were attached to Triton's motion for new trial. 1\n\n *55 On June 21, 2010, the trial court denied Triton's motion for reconsideration/new trial and\nstated that it did not consider the stricken affidavits. On July 6, 2010, the trial court signed a\nmodified order stating:\n\n   On this day, after hearing [Triton's] Motion for Reconsideration/New Trial (“Motion”), the\n   Court, relying solely [on] the summary judgment evidence on file, arguments of counsel and\n   without considering the stricken, untimely supplement filed by [Triton], is of the opinion that\n   [Triton's] Motion should be, in all things, DENIED.\n\n   It is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that [Triton's] Motion is denied and\n   that the Court's order of April 26, 2010, granting Plaintiff's Traditional Motion for Summary\n   Judgment is hereby, in all things, REAFFIRMED.\n\nOn July 28, 2010, the trial court signed an order granting StarTex's motion for a turnover order\nand appointing a receiver. On September 9, 2010, the trial court signed another order requiring\nthe receiver to pay to StarTex as the judgment creditor the balance of the rents collected during\nhis receivership and any rents collected in the future until the full amount of the judgment is paid.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Id.\n\nIn its first through seventh issues, Triton argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\njudgment in favor of StarTex on its breach of contract claim. The trial court awarded StarTex\nsummary judgment on both grounds of StarTex's breach of contract claim against Triton: that\nTriton breached (1) by failing to pay the invoices for electricity provided and (2) by wrongfully\nterminating the contract early.\n\n\nB. Summary Judgment on StarTex's Breach of Contract Claim for Triton's Failure to Pay\nfor Invoiced Electricity\nIn its first and second issues, Triton argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\nbecause it misinterpreted and misapplied the law applicable to StarTex's breach of contract claim\nand to Triton's defenses. In its third issue, Triton argues that StarTex's summary *56 judgment\nevidence did not establish that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\n [6] [7] To prevail on a breach of contract claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) the existence of a valid\ncontract; (2) the plaintiff's performance or tender of performance; (3) the defendant's breach of\ncontract; and (4) the plaintiff's damages as a result of the breach.

Evidence Establishing Elements of StarTex's Claim\nAttached to its summary judgment motion, StarTex included copies of the ESA and First and\nSecond Amendments. Neither party disputes that these documents constitute a valid contract\nbetween them.\n\nStarTex also provided summary judgment evidence, including multiple invoices and the affidavits\nof two corporate representatives, that it provided electricity to Triton. Triton does not dispute that\nStarTex provided it with electricity up until Triton terminated the ESA.\n\nStarTex provided invoices and affidavits demonstrating that Triton owed $105,034.18 under the\nunpaid invoices. The account summary on the final invoice showed that Triton owed $155,034.18\nas of November 15, 2008. Verhage's affidavit testimony provided that Triton subsequently made\n$50,000.00 in payments, leaving $105,034.18 due and owing.\n\n[8] We conclude that StarTex conclusively established its right to recover $105,034.18 from\nTriton for Triton's breach of contract by failing to pay the invoices. Thus, the burden shifted to\nTriton to respond to the motion for summary judgment and present evidence raising a fact issue\non at least one of the elements of StarTex's claim or to present a valid defense. See Willrich, 28\nS.W.3d at 23.\n\n\n2. Triton's Response\nIn its fourth issue, Triton argues that it presented summary judgment evidence controverting\nStarTex's evidence and raising genuine issues of material fact as to one or more elements of\nStarTex's breach of contract claim. Triton does not dispute that StarTex provided electricity to its\nbuildings throughout the term of the contract up until Triton terminated the agreement. Neither\ndoes Triton dispute that it did not pay amounts invoiced by StarTex for the electricity provided.\nHowever, Triton disputes (1) the terms of the contract as presented by StarTex, alleging that the\nparties orally modified their agreement; (2) StarTex's satisfactory performance under the contract\nand its own excuse from performance by StarTex's prior material breach; (3) the sufficiency of\nStarTex's evidence to support the amount of damages awarded by the trial court; and (4) the trial\ncourt's implicit determination that it was not entitled to any offsets or credits.\n\n\n\n                              (a) The alleged oral modification of the contract\n\nTriton argues that, according to Gary's affidavit testimony, the agreement between the parties was\norally modified by representations Bejger made prior to execution of the Second Amendment that\ninvoices based on estimated usage would no longer be used. Gary testified that he *57 represented\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                14\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nto Bejger that the practice of estimating electricity usage for several consecutive months was\ncausing damage to Triton because Triton could not bill its tenants based on estimated billing\nand that Triton would not continue the business relationship with StarTex if it continued to use\nestimations and make errors in the monthly invoices. Gary averred that Bejger represented that the\nerrors would be corrected, that StarTex was attempting to resolve the allegations that CenterPoint\ndid not have access to Triton's meters, and “that StarTex's previous practice of estimating usage\nof consecutive months would not continue.” Gary stated that Triton entered into the Second\nAmendment based on these representations by Bejger. Thus, on appeal, Triton argues that it agreed\nto the Second Amendment “only after receiving assurances that the billing errors and repeated use\nof estimated billing would be addressed and corrected by [StarTex].”\n\n [9] [10] A written agreement not required by law to be in writing may be modified by a later\noral agreement. Double Diamond, Inc. v. Hilco Elec. Coop., Inc., 127 S.W.3d 260, 267 (Tex.App.-\nWaco 2003, no pet.); Mar–Lan Indus., Inc. v. Nelson, 635 S.W.2d 853, 855 (Tex.App.-El Paso\n1982, no writ). However, this principle does not apply here. The statements Gary related in his\naffidavit as being made by Bejger and orally modifying the contract were made before the parties\nentered into the Second Amendment. Thus, the statements Triton asserts as oral modifications are,\nat most, extraneous evidence of negotiations prior to entering a written contract, which constitutes\nparol evidence. 2\n\n [11] [12] [13] “An unambiguous contract will be enforced as written, and parol evidence will\nnot be received for the purpose of creating an ambiguity or to give the contract a meaning different\nfrom that which its language imports.” David J. Sacks, P.C. v. Haden, 266 S.W.3d 447, 450\n(Tex.2008). Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law. Id. at 451.

CBI Indus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517, 521 (Tex.1995).\n\n [14] Here, the Second Amendment expressly provided that, except for the extension of the term\nof the contract and the pricing scheme outlined in paragraph one, the ESA “shall remain in full\nforce and effect as written.” This includes the “Customer Acknowledgments” section of the ESA,\nwhich expressly stated that StarTex's “ability to invoice Customer is dependent on the [TDSP's]\nability to furnish ... meter readings” and that StarTex “may invoice Customer based on estimated\nmeter reading.” As matter of law, we conclude that the Second Amendment is not ambiguous. It\nextended the terms of the ESA, including the express provision allowing StarTex to invoice Triton\nbased on estimated meter readings, to the new 36–month term.\n\nTriton failed to establish that the parties orally modified the contract.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\n\n             (b) Triton's entitlement to be excused from performing under the contract\n\nTriton also argues it was excused from performance under the ESA and the subsequent *58\namendments by StarTex's prior material breach.\n\n [15] [16] “[T]he contention that a party to a contract is excused from performance because\nof a prior material breach by the other contracting party is an affirmative defense....” See City\nof The Colony v. N. Tex. Mun. Water Dist., 272 S.W.3d 699, 746 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2008,\npet. dism'd). The burden of proving an affirmative defense is on the party asserting it. See Am.\nPetrofina, Inc. v. Allen, 887 S.W.2d 829, 830 (Tex.1994). Thus, Triton had to present evidence\nraising a fact question on each element of its defense to defeat StarTex's motion for summary\njudgment. See id. (holding, where “response was in the nature of an affirmative defense,” that\nparty asserting defense “could only have defeated summary judgment with sufficient evidence to\nraise a fact question for each of the elements” of defense).\n\n [17] [18] [19] “It is a fundamental principle of contract law that when one party to a contract\ncommits a material breach of that contract, the other party is discharged or excused from further\nperformance.” Mustang Pipeline Co. v. Driver Pipeline Co., 134 S.W.3d 195, 196 (Tex.2004). A\nbreach of contract occurs when a party fails to perform an act that it has expressly or impliedly\npromised to perform. Henry v. Masson, 333 S.W.3d 825, 835 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2010,\nno pet.). The materiality of a breach—the question of whether a party's breach of a contract will\nrender the contract unenforceable—generally presents a dispute for resolution by the trier of fact.\nId. Here, however, because we determine that StarTex's actions did not breach the contract as a\nmatter of law, we need not consider whether Triton raised a fact issue on materiality.\n\n [20] To raise a material fact issue on every element of its affirmative defense, Triton had to raise\na fact question on StarTex's prior breach of contract. Triton argues that StarTex's use of estimated\nbilling was not proper under the contract because StarTex did not establish that the conditions\nprecedent to using estimated billing had occurred because StarTex did not prove that CenterPoint\nwas unable to access Triton's meters.\n\nThe ESA provides:\n\n   Customer Acknowledgments. Customer acknowledges that [StarTex's] ability to invoice\n   Customer is dependent on the [transmission and distribution provider (TDSP) ]'s or ERCOT's\n   ability to furnish [StarTex] all necessary information including meter readings or recorded data,\n   as applicable. In the absence of such information from the TDSP or ERCOT, [StarTex] may\n   invoice Customer based on estimated meter reading according to the Usage Profile. As soon as\n   practical, and after receipt of Customer's Energy Consumption and settlement charges from the\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\n   TDSP and/or ERCOT, [StarTex] will reconcile on the next invoice any difference(s) between\n   estimated and actual consumption and settlement charges.\n\nThus, the plain, unambiguous language of the ESA provided that StarTex could invoice Triton\nbased on estimated usage in the absence of actual meter readings or other necessary information\nfrom CenterPoint, the TDSP. This contract provision is consistent with the legislatively mandated\ndivision of business activities in the electric utility market. See TEX. UTIL.CODE ANN. §\n39.051(b) (providing that electricity utilities must separate their business activities into three units\n—power generation company, retail electric provider, and transmission and distribution utility);\nTex. Indus. Energy Consumers, 324 S.W.3d at 97–98 *59 (observing that transmission and\ndistribution service providers are responsible for providing metering services).\n\nStarTex provided the affidavit of Robert Verhage, who averred that, on several occasions, it had\nto rely on estimated usage because CenterPoint did not provide Triton's actual meter usage. The\nsummary judgment evidence also contained an e-mail from a CenterPoint representative stating\nthat Triton was to blame for CenterPoint's failure to obtain actual meter readings. This e-mail\nshows that CenterPoint acknowledged that it provided StarTex with estimated usage rather than\nactual readings on several occasions and that StarTex was not at fault for CenterPoint's inability\nto access and read the meters.\n\nThe ESA expressly permits invoicing based on estimated usage. Triton did not present any\nsummary judgment evidence that StarTex used estimates in its invoices on occasions when\nCenterPoint had provided actual meter readings. Thus, this argument is without merit.\n\n [21] Triton also argues that, even if StarTex was permitted to use estimates in invoicing Triton\nfor its electricity usage, StarTex was required to reconcile any charges based on estimated usage\non the next bill. However, the plain language of the contract provides that StarTex must reconcile\nthe estimated usage with the actual usage “[a]s soon as practical, and after receipt of Customer's\nEnergy Consumption and settlement charges from the TDSP.” Triton's argument that the actual\nusage was required to be reconciled on the next month's bill is not supported by the plain language\nof the contract.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that Triton has not raised a fact issue on any element of its claim that\nStarTex committed a prior material breach of the contract.\n\n\n\n                                (c) StarTex's alleged failure to prove damages\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nIn its fifth, sixth, and seventh issues, Triton argues that the invoices relied on by StarTex in\nestablishing the amount of damages were inadequate estimates and were properly objected to and\ndisputed by Triton. Thus, Triton argues that StarTex failed to prove its damages as a matter of law.\n\nStarTex acknowledges that it used estimates in some of its bills, and we have already concluded\nthat it was permitted to do so by the plain language of the contract. Furthermore, StarTex presented\nthe actual invoices it sent Triton and Verhage's affidavit stating that the final invoice relied on in\ncalculating the amount due and owing “contained the final, outstanding balance that was reconciled\nto correct all estimated reads.”\n\nTriton presented Gary's affidavit testimony that he disputed several invoices and objected to\nnumerous charges. It also presented e-mail correspondence between Gary, Triton's property\nmanager, and StarTex, in which Gary made general objections to several invoices without\nproviding specific amounts or portions of the invoices that he believed were inaccurate. Triton also\npresented an expert affidavit pointing out general complaints about the invoices without specifying\nparticular amounts in controversy.\n\nTriton argues that StarTex was legally obligated to address Triton's objections to StarTex's billing\npractices before collecting on the unpaid invoices and that this evidence raises a fact question\nregarding the amount Triton owed to StarTex.\n\n [22] The contract provides a method for disputing charges on invoices. The ESA provides that the\n“Customer must provide to [StarTex] written notice setting forth in particular detail any disputed\n *60 amount, including the calculations with respect to any errors or inaccuracies claimed.” The\nrecord contains no evidence that Triton complied with this procedure. Neither Gary's and Phillips'\naffidavit testimony nor the e-mails sent to StarTex contain specific amounts or calculations. Triton\ndid not produce any evidence that it provided StarTex with written notice articulating the particular\ndisputed amount or calculations regarding claimed inaccuracies.\n\nThus, Triton failed to present evidence raising a fact issue on the accuracy of the invoices StarTex\nused to support its claim for the unpaid amounts for electricity usage.\n\n\n\n                                 (d) Triton's entitlement to offsets and credits\n\nTriton also argues that it was entitled to $97,000 in offsets and credits, based on Phillips' affidavit.\n\n [23] “The right of offset is an affirmative defense.” Brown v. Am. Transfer & Storage Co., 601\nS.W.2d 931, 936 (Tex.1980). Triton must show its entitlement to an offset and the amount. See\nid. (holding that party asserting right of offset bears burden of pleading offset and proving facts\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  18\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nnecessary to support it). Thus, Triton must present evidence raising a fact question on its offset\ndefense to defeat StarTex's motion for summary judgment. See Am. Petrofina, 887 S.W.2d at 830.\n\n [24] Triton presented Phillips' affidavit, in which Phillips, as an electricity engineer, stated that the\ninvoices contained errors entitling Triton to offsets and credits worth at least $97,000. However,\nas we have already stated, Triton did not provide a proper challenge to any particular charge or\ninvoice. Phillip's conclusory statements in his affidavit, by themselves, do not support Triton's\nclaim for offsets and credits. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(f) (providing that supporting affidavit must\nset forth facts that would be admissible in evidence); Wadewitz v. Montgomery, 951 S.W.2d 464,\n466 (Tex.1997) (holding that expert's testimony will support summary judgment only if it is “clear,\npositive and direct, otherwise credible and free from contradictions and inconsistencies, and could\nhave been readily controverted” and that conclusory statements by an expert are insufficient to\nsupport or defeat summary judgment).\n\nThus, we conclude that Triton failed to raise a fact issue on any element of StarTex's breach\nof contract claim against Triton for failure to pay the invoices. The trial court did not err in\ndetermining that Triton was entitled to summary judgment on this issue as a matter of law.\n\n\nC. Summary Judgment on StarTex's Breach of Contract Claim for Triton's Early\nTermination of the Contract\nIn parts of its first through seventh issues, Triton also argues that the trial court erred in granting\nsummary judgment on StarTex's breach of contract claim for Triton's wrongful early termination\nof the agreement.\n\n\n1. Evidence Establishing Elements of StarTex's Claim\nAs we have discussed, StarTex established the existence of a valid contract between itself and\nTriton, and it established that it performed under that contract. StarTex provided a copy of the\nSecond Amendment, which provided that the parties agreed to extend the ESA through May 2011.\n\nThe ESA contained the following early termination provision:\n\n   Early Termination Fee. In the event that Customer terminates this agreement *61 or Customer\n   defaults as described [in the ESA], then an Early Termination Fee will be assessed. The Early\n   Termination Fee shall be equal to the greater of a) the three months highest bills for Customer\n   or b) any mark to market costs.\n\nStarTex presented Verhage's affidavit testimony that Triton terminated the agreement on October\n10, 2008, approximately thirty-one months earlier than the Second Amendment's contractual\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   19\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\ntermination date of May 2011, and Triton's final invoice reflecting a termination date in the middle\nof October 2008.\n\nStarTex likewise provided Madden's affidavit testimony that StarTex was harmed by Triton's early\ntermination. Madden averred that when StarTex entered into the Second Amendment extending\nthe terms of the ESA through May 2011, it contracted with its electricity producer “to purchase\nenough power to service the entire thirty-six (36) month term of the Second Amendment and the\npurchases were tailored to fit Triton's particular ‘shape’.” After Triton unilaterally terminated the\ncontract on October 10, 2008, StarTex was still obligated to continue to purchase power from its\nsupplier through May 2011 “in Triton's particular ‘shape,’ ” even though StarTex no longer had a\ncustomer to whom to sell it. Madden testified that it was almost impossible to sell that electricity\nto another customer because StarTex “would have to find a new customer who not only wants\nan MCPE contract, but has the exact same term and volume requirements and ‘shape’ as Triton.”\nAccording to Madden, these particular characteristics of a MCPE payment arrangement made it\nvery difficult to calculate the mark-to-market losses because StarTex had no way of knowing what\nthe exact cost of the future electricity would be. StarTex thus calculated its liquidated damages as\n$197,323.25 based on the sum of Triton's three highest monthly bills.\n\n\n2. Triton's response\nTriton does not contest that it terminated the contract in October 2008, approximately thirty-one\nmonths before the termination date provided in the Second Amendment. Triton again argues that\nits early termination was excused by StarTex's prior breach by billing based on estimated usage.\nWe have already concluded that StarTex did not breach the ESA when it invoiced Triton based\non its estimated usage.\n\nTriton also raises several issues specific to the early termination clause and the trial court's award\nof liquidated damages. In its ninth issue, Triton argues that the early termination fee clause is\nunenforceable as an impermissible penalty. Triton argues in its tenth and eleventh issues that\neven if the early termination fee clause is enforceable as a matter of law, StarTex did not present\nsummary judgment evidence establishing the amount of the early termination fee in compliance\nwith the contract's terms.\n\n\n\n                                (a) Enforceability of early termination clause\n\nTriton argues that the early termination fee clause constitutes an impermissible penalty. Triton\nargues that it is impermissible both under the common law standard set out in Phillips v. Phillips,\n820 S.W.2d 785 (Tex.1991), and under the Texas Business and Commerce Code.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\n [25] [26] [27] [28] Whether a contractual provision is an enforceable liquidated damages\nprovision or an unenforceable penalty is a question of law for the court to decide. Dorsett,\n164 S.W.3d at 664 (citing Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788). Valid liquidated damages clauses “fix\nin advance the compensation to a party accruing from the failure to *62 perform specified\ncontractual obligations.” Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d at 664. To enforce a liquidated damages clause,\nthe court must find that (1) the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation\nand (2) the amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788; GPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care Sys., 344 S.W.3d 467, 475\n(Tex.App.-Dallas 2011, pet. denied). The party asserting that the provision is unenforceable bears\nthe burden of proof. GPA Holding, 344 S.W.3d at 475.\n\n [29] Triton argues that the harm caused by its breach is not incapable or difficult of estimation.\nTriton argues that StarTex “could determine the amount of electricity that would have been\npurchased by Triton but for the purported breach ... and determine what the electricity was sold for\nto an alternate customer versus what it would have been sold for to Triton.” However, StarTex's\nSenior Vice–President of Supply, Stephen Madden, provided affidavit testimony that it is almost\nimpossible to know what the cost of Triton's future energy use would have been because of the\nconstantly fluctuating prices involved in the MCPE pricing structure. He averred that the price\nof electricity changes as often as every fifteen minutes, that StarTex committed to buy electricity\nin fifteen minute increments to meet its obligation to provide electricity conforming to Triton's\nunique “shape” of energy consumption, and thus it would be very difficult to find another consumer\nto use that energy. Accordingly, it was not possible to determine, at the time of Triton's early\ntermination, the cost of the energy that would have been purchased by Triton but for the breach,\nand it was also very difficult for StarTex to predict whether it would find another consumer to\npurchase the electricity according to Triton's unique usage pattern, and if so, how much such a\nconsumer would pay.\n\nTriton did not present any evidence regarding the parties' ability to estimate actual damages when\nthe contract was formed, and it did not controvert Madden's description of the pricing model\napplicable to the ESA and Second Amendment. Thus, we conclude that it was impossible to\ndetermine the actual harm that would be caused by early termination. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d\nat 788.\n\nTriton also appears to argue that the amount of the liquidated damages was not a reasonable\nforecast of StarTex's actual damages because it was unreasonably large. The ESA provided that\nthe early termination fee “shall be equal to the greater of a) the three months highest bills for\nCustomer or b) any mark to market costs.” In this instance, due to the length of the term remaining\non the terminated contract and the uncertainties of pricing, the “mark to market costs” could not\nbe calculated. Thus, Madden testified that StarTex calculated its damages based on Triton's three\nhighest monthly bills, which totaled $197,323.25.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\n\n [30] Triton did not present any evidence regarding what a reasonable forecast of damages would\nhave been at the time the contract was formed, nor did it present any evidence of StarTex's actual\ndamages. Thus, we conclude that, when viewed as of the time the contract was executed, the ESA's\nmethod for calculating the amount of liquidated damages provided a reasonable forecast of just\ncompensation. See id.\n\n [31] This same reasoning also demonstrates that Triton failed to show that the early termination\nfee violated Business and Commerce Code section 2.718. Section 2.718 provides that a liquidated\ndamages clause is unenforceable if (1) the *63 agreed amount is unreasonable in light of the\nanticipated or actual harm caused by breach, (2) the proof of actual harm is not difficult, (3)\nobtaining an adequate remedy for breach is not inconvenient or not feasible, or (4) the agreed\namount is unreasonably large. See TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.718 (Vernon 2009).\nAs we have already discussed, the proof of actual harm is difficult, and obtaining an adequate\nremedy for breach is not feasible because StarTex could not have calculated the future cost of\nthe electricity, nor could it predict the extent to which it could mitigate its damages. And, the\nagreed amount was not unreasonably large or unreasonable in light of the anticipated or actual\nharm. StarTex was obligated to buy thirty-one months' worth of electricity that it had no ability\nto resell. In that light, liquidated damages calculated from Triton's three highest monthly invoices\nare not unreasonable.\n\nTriton failed to raise a fact question on its claim that the early termination fee clause constituted\nan impermissible penalty.\n\n\n\n                                   (b) StarTex's proof of liquidated damages\n\nTriton also argues that StarTex failed to prove the amount of liquidated damages permitted under\nthe ESA. Several of Triton's arguments on this issue again challenge the accuracy of StarTex's\nbilling and StarTex's use of estimates in its invoices. However, we have already determined that\nTriton has failed to raise a fact question regarding the accuracy or propriety of StarTex's invoices.\nThus, we do not address those arguments again.\n\nTriton argues that StarTex failed to identify which three invoices it relied on in calculating the\nliquidated damages. It also argues that no three invoices from the term of the Second Amendment\nadd up to $197,323.95, and, thus, StarTex improperly used invoices dated prior to the execution\nof the Second Amendment to calculate the early termination fee. However, the early termination\nfee provision did not limit the time period from which the three highest bills could be taken, and\nTriton failed to present these arguments to the trial court. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c) (“Issues\nnot expressly presented to the trial court by written motion, answer or other response shall not\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 38.001(8) (Vernon 2008); Haden v. *64 David J.\nSacks, P.C., 332 S.W.3d 503, 510 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied). An award\nof attorney's fees must be supported by evidence that the fees are reasonable and necessary.\nSee Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex.1991). A trial court determines\nthe reasonableness of an attorney's fees award by considering the factors enumerated in Arthur\nAndersen & Co. v. Perry Equipment Corp. 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex.1997) (holding that evidence\nof contingency fee agreement alone does not support award of reasonable and necessary attorney's\nfees and that trial court must still consider other factors). The reasonableness of attorney's fees is\ngenerally a fact issue. Haden, 332 S.W.3d at 512. We review attorney's fees awards for an abuse\nof discretion. Ridge Oil Co., Inc. v. Guinn Invs., Inc., 148 S.W.3d 143, 163 (Tex.2004).\n\n [35] [36] An attorney's affidavit constitutes expert testimony that will support an award of\nattorney's fees in a summary judgment proceeding. Haden, 332 S.W.3d at 513; see TEX.R. CIV.\nP. 166a(c); Gensco, Inc. v. Transformaciones Metalurgicias Especiales, S.A., 666 S.W.2d 549,\n554 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1984, writ dism'd). Civil Practice and Remedies Code section\n38.003 provides that “usual and customary attorney's fees” are presumed to be reasonable. TEX.\nCIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 38.003 (Vernon 2008). Although the statutory presumption\nthat usual and customary fees are reasonable is rebuttable, see id., once triggered by an attorney's\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  23\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nsupporting affidavit, the presumption of reasonableness remains in effect when there is no evidence\nsubmitted to challenge the affidavit proof of the summary judgment movant. Haden, 332 S.W.3d\nat 513.\n\n\nB. Analysis\n [37] In its motion for summary judgment, StarTex sought $75,589.36 in attorney's fees, and\nits attorney, Rodney Drinnon, submitted an affidavit in support of an award for attorney's fees.\nDrinnon averred that the contingency fee agreement awarding twenty-five percent of damages\nrecovered from any successful trial award constituted usual and customary attorney's fees; he\nprovided a list of specific tasks he and his law practice undertook during the course of representing\nStarTex; and he stated that his fee was supported by several, listed Arthur Andersen factors.\nDrinnon's description was “ ‘clear, positive, and direct, otherwise credible’ and [was] neither\ninternally inconsistent nor [contradictory]” and could have been readily controverted by Triton.\nSee id. at 514. Based on Drinnon's affidavit, submitted as evidence in support of the request for\nattorney's fees, StarTex was entitled to the statutory presumption that its attorney's usual and\ncustomary fees were reasonable. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 38.003; see also\nHaden, 332 S.W.3d at 514 (holding attorney's affidavit sufficient to warrant summary judgment\nwhen it (1) contained recitals establishing attorney's competency to swear to facts stated and\nother requirements of Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(f), (2) described work encompassed by the\nfees sought, and (3) specified factors that formed basis of his statement that amount claimed was\nreasonable and necessary, tracking seven of eight Arthur Andersen factors).\n\nTriton filed a written objection to Drinnon's affidavit, arguing that it failed to describe the time\nrequired to prosecute StarTex's claim, to provide counsel's hourly rate, and to discuss two of the\nArthur Andersen factors. We have already concluded that Drinnon's affidavit was sufficient *65\nto support StarTex's claim for attorney's fees. See Haden, 332 S.W.3d at 514. Triton did not file a\ncontroverting affidavit or any other evidence disputing Drinnon's evidence. Because Triton did not\npresent any controverting evidence, Triton cannot overcome the presumption of reasonableness\naccorded to Drinnon's affidavit in support of an award of attorney's fees. See id. at 514–16 (holding\nthat because nonmovant “did not controvert [attorney's] affidavit or otherwise dispute the law\nfirm's evidence, the law firm was ... entitled to the statutory presumption that the requested amount\nwas both reasonable and necessary”).\n\n [38] [39] Triton also argues that StarTex is not entitled to attorney's fees on the basis of its\naffirmative defense that StarTex made an excessive demand on Triton prior to filing suit. See Kurtz\nv. Kurtz, 158 S.W.3d 12, 21 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet. denied). When a claimant\nmakes an “excessive” demand and will not accept a lesser amount, the claimant is not entitled\nto attorney's fees expended in litigation thereafter, even if it prevails on its breach of contract\nclaim. See, e.g., McMillin v. State Farm Lloyds, 180 S.W.3d 183, 209 (Tex.App.-Austin 2005,\npet. denied) (citing Findlay v. Cave, 611 S.W.2d 57, 58 (Tex.1981)). Demand is not excessive\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               24\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nsimply because it is greater than the amount eventually awarded. See Findlay, 611 S.W.2d at 58.\nThe dispositive question is whether the claimant acted unreasonably or in bad faith in making\nthe demand. See Standard Constructors, Inc. v. Chevron Chem. Co., 101 S.W.3d 619, 627–28\n(Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied).\n\n [40] StarTex's demand letter requested $105,034.18 as principal on the unpaid invoices,\n$14,290.98 in interest and fees, $197,323.95 in liquidated damages, and $68,329.82 in attorney's\nfees. It stated that Triton should pay the listed amounts within thirty days or make arrangements\nto satisfy the debt. Thus, the amounts demanded by StarTex prior to filing suit were not so much\ngreater than the amount it was eventually awarded as to be “excessive” or to indicate that the\ndemand was made in bad faith. Triton presented no evidence that StarTex would have refused\ntender of the $314,358.13 awarded by the trial court. Triton has failed to establish that this\nexception to StarTex's statutory right to attorney's fees is met. See Findlay, 611 S.W.2d at 58;\nMcMillin, 180 S.W.3d at 209.\n\nWe hold that the trial court did not err in awarding StarTex $12,000 in attorney's fees.\n\nWe overrule Triton's twelfth point of error.\n\n\n\n                                                      Other Issues\n\nA. PUC Rules and Procedures for Disputed Charges\n [41] In its eighth issue, Triton argues that its pending claim against StarTex before the PUC acted\nto stay the judgment and enforcement of the judgment. In its brief, Triton also argues that StarTex\nfailed to properly investigate Triton's complaints according to the PUC's rules and procedures.\nHowever, Triton did not present these arguments to the trial court. Furthermore, the only indication\nbefore this Court that Triton actually filed a complaint with the PUC is Triton's statement in its\nappellate brief. We conclude that these complaints are not properly presented for our review. See\nTEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Marek v. Tomoco Equip. Co., 738 S.W.2d 710, 712 (Tex.App.-Houston\n[14th Dist.] 1987, no writ) (“The trial court considers the record only as it properly appears when\nthe motion for summary judgment is heard.”); see also TEX.R.APP. P. 33.1(a) (providing that,\n“[a]s a prerequisite *66 to presenting a complaint for appellate review, the record must show\nthat ... the complaint was made to the trial court by a timely request, objection or motion”).\n\nWe overrule Triton's eighth issue.\n\n\nB. Receivership and Turnover Order\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.              25\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nIn its thirteenth and fourteenth issues, Triton argues that, because the trial court erred in granting\nsummary judgment, the trial court also erred in appointing a receiver and in ordering Triton to turn\nover to the receiver confidential records and all proceeds and revenues generated by its businesses.\nThus, Triton argues that it is entitled to immediate relief from the order appointing a receiver and\nthe turnover order, including return of all records and revenues turned over to or seized by the\nreceiver. We have already concluded that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment.\nTherefore, this argument fails.\n\nWe overrule Triton's thirteenth and fourteenth issues.\n\n\n\n                                                               Conclusion\n\nWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\nJustice SHARP concurring in the judgment only.\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    StarTex moved this Court to strike the affidavits Triton submitted with its motion for reconsideration or new trial from the appellate\n        record. Those affidavits were part of Triton's motion, and “any filing that a party designates to have included in the record” is a proper\n        part of the clerk's record. TEX.R.APP. P. 34.5(a)(13). Therefore, we DENY StarTex's motion. We note, however, that the affidavits\n        attached to Triton's motion for reconsideration or new trial are not relevant to our review of the trial court's summary judgment. See\n        TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Marek v. Tomoco Equip. Co., 738 S.W.2d 710, 712 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1987, no writ) (“The\n        trial court considers the record only as it properly appears when the motion for summary judgment is heard.”).\n2       StarTex also presented Bejger's affidavit testimony that he did not make the representations alleged by Gary. Triton objected to this\n        evidence in the trial court, but it is not clear whether Triton is arguing on appeal that Bejger's affidavit should not be considered.\n        However, it is unnecessary for us to consider Bejger's testimony as the terms of the contract are established as a matter of law.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Liquidity Solutions, L.P., 277 S.W.3d 917 (2009)\n\n\n\n\nOpinion by Justice MAZZANT.\n\nUrban Television Network Corporation appeals the summary judgment rendered against it in the\nbreach of contract suit brought by Westar Satellite Services, L.P. Westar subsequently transferred\nits interest in the judgment to Creditor Liquidity Solutions, L.P. Appellant brings one issue,\nasserting the trial court erred in granting Westar's motion for summary judgment on the liquidated\ndamages provision of the contract because that provision was an unenforceable penalty. We affirm\nthe trial court's judgment.\n\nIn 2005, appellant and Westar entered into a five-year Master Services Agreement in which\nappellant promised to pay Westar $8800 each month and Westar promised to provide appellant\nsatellite uplink services for local television programming and distribution. Paragraph 7 of the\nagreement contained a liquidated damages provision:\n\n            7. Early Termination Liability. In the event that Customer [appellant] terminates\n            Service prior to the expiration of the Term specified on the appropriate Service\n            Agreement or other request for Service other than for cause, or in the event that\n            Company [Westar] terminates this Agreement as a result of Customer's failure\n            to abide by the terms and conditions herein, Customer shall pay a termination\n            charge equal to 100% of the monthly charges multiplied by the number of\n            months remaining on the Term of the Service Agreement or any additional\n            requests for Service, as applicable.\n\nIn 2007, appellant defaulted on its obligations under the agreement. Westar terminated the\nagreement and sued appellant for breach of contract seeking an award of damages under paragraph\n7. In response to Westar's motion for summary judgment, appellant admitted it defaulted on the\nagreement, but it asserted that paragraph 7 was an unenforceable penalty. The trial court granted\nWestar's motion for summary judgment and awarded Westar damages pursuant to paragraph 7. 1\n\nTo prevail on a summary judgment motion brought under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c),\na movant must show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law. TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Little v. Tex. Dep't of Criminal Justice,\n148 S.W.3d 374, 381 (Tex.2004). If the movant establishes a right to summary judgment, the\nburden shifts to the nonmovant to raise a genuine issue of material fact in order to defeat summary\njudgment. Teter v. Comm'n for Lawyer Discipline, 261 S.W.3d 796, 798 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2008,\nno pet.). A plaintiff who establishes entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on its cause of\naction will not be prevented from obtaining summary judgment merely because the defendant\nhas asserted an affirmative defense.

Co. v.\nKnott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex.2003).\n\n [1] [2] An assertion that a liquidated damages provision is a penalty is an affirmative defense\nthat the defendant has the burden of pleading and proving. Murphy v. Cintas Corp., 923 S.W.2d\n663, 665–66 (Tex.App.-Tyler 1996, writ denied); see TEX.R. CIV. P. 94; see also Fluid Concepts,\nInc. v. DA Apartments Ltd. P'ship, 159 S.W.3d 226, 231 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005, no pet.). Thus, to\navoid summary judgment, appellant had to present some evidence showing the liquidated damages\nprovision was a penalty. See Wilson, 897 S.W.2d at 823; see also Fluid Concepts, Inc., 159 S.W.3d\nat 231.\n\n [3] A liquidated damages provision is enforceable and is not a penalty when the damages are\nuncertain and the stipulated damages are reasonable. Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 788\n(Tex.1991) (quoting Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 669, 245 S.W.2d 484, 486 (1952)). Appellant\nargues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because Westar presented no evidence\nshowing the damages were uncertain or that the stipulated damages were reasonable. Appellant,\nnot Westar, had the burden of presenting evidence that the liquidated damages provision was a\npenalty, and appellant presented no evidence showing the damages were not uncertain or that the\nstipulated damages were unreasonable. See Murphy, 923 S.W.2d at 665–66.\n\n [4] Appellant also argues the liquidated damages provision is a penalty on its face because,\nappellant asserts, it “applies to breach of any covenant of the agreement, and not merely to payment\nprovisions.” Appellant cites Bethel v. Butler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d 834 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston\n[14th Dist.] 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.), which stated that a liquidated damages provision is a penalty as\na matter of law when “it applied equally to any breach of any provision of the contract by appellee\nirrespective of the importance or triviality of such breach.” Id. at 837. The court observed that\n“[u]nder the liquidated damage clause as written, appellant would be entitled to the full amount\nof monthly payments for the full term of the contract irrespective of the nature of the breach or\nappellant's actual loss or damage.” Id.\n\nWe disagree, however, with appellant's assertion that the liquidated damages provision applied to\nany breach of the agreement, no matter how trivial. Paragraph 7 permits Westar to recover the\nliquidated damages when Westar terminates the agreement for appellant's failure to abide by the\nterms of the agreement. Paragraphs 13 and 14 define the types of defaults for which Westar could\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   3\n\fUrban Television Network Corp. v. Liquidity Solutions, L.P., 277 S.W.3d 917 (2009)\n\n\n\nterminate the agreement. Paragraph 13 authorizes termination when appellant fails to make full and\ntimely payments under the agreement. Paragraph 14 authorizes termination for an “Other Default,”\nthat is, a default other that a failure to pay the amounts due. However, Paragraph 14 defines\n“Other Default” as occurring when “either party fails to perform or observe any material term or\nobligation....” (Emphasis added.) This requirement of breach of a “material term or obligation”\nbefore termination may occur distinguishes this agreement from the contract in Bethel.\n\n *920 Appellant has not established that the liquidated damages provision is unenforceable on\nits face or presented evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact as to its enforceability. We\noverrule appellant's issue on appeal.\n\nWe affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Besides its default on the Master Services Agreement, appellant also defaulted on a promissory note payable to Westar. Westar sued\n        for breach of the promissory note as well breach of the agreement, and Westar sought foreclosure of its security interest in appellant's\n        property. The trial court granted Westar's motion for summary judgment on the breach of the note and foreclosure of the collateral.\n        Appellant's issue and argument on appeal do not assert error in the rendition of judgment on those claims.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

William and Yuko Colthurst (the landlords)\nleased their home in Tyler to Tim and Stephanie (Scholler) Williams (the tenants) in a written lease\nsigned on March 6, 2000. The lease provided for a term of two years beginning on May 1, 2000,\nand ending April 30, 2002. The landlords' home was available for lease for an extended period\nof time because they were moving to Japan. The landlords designated a real estate firm, Century\n21 Advantage, to serve as the property manager for the house during the term of the lease. Tom\nDeWitt served as the individual that managed the property on behalf of Century 21 Advantage.\n\nIn the early part of 2002, the landlords and the tenants began discussing the disposition of the\nhome at the end of the lease. The tenants had expressed an interest in continuing to lease the home.\nThe landlords informed the tenants that they wanted to sell the home when the lease ended in\nApril. The tenants subsequently invoked an extension clause of the lease that permitted them to\nunilaterally extend the lease for an additional six months.\n\nThe tenants' desire to remain in the home for an additional six months changed when Mrs. Williams\nwas sexually assaulted in the home on April 16, 2002. Mr. Williams informed the landlords in\nan e-mail on April 20, 2002, that the tenants did not want to continue occupying the home. 1\nMr. Williams suggested to the landlords in this e-mail that, unless they listed the house for\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The landlords and the\ntenants subsequently exchanged several e-mails over the course of the next month discussing the\npossibility of the tenants vacating the home prior to the end of the six-month extension period.\nThe tenants ultimately vacated the home at the end of May 2002.\n\nThe landlords subsequently filed suit against the tenants on January 8, 2003, asserting claims\nfor unpaid rent and property damage. The tenants responded by filing a counterclaim against\nthe landlords asserting a statutory claim for wrongful withholding of their security deposit and a\npremises liability claim in connection with the sexual assault. With respect to the premises liability\nclaim, the tenants alleged that the landlords had failed to equip the home with proper security\ndevices required by statute. The tenants additionally asserted a premises liability claim against\nWGW Properties, Inc. d/b/a Century 21 Advantage, Tom DeWitt, and Century 21 Real Estate\nCorporation (collectively referred to as the property manager). The landlords joined the assailant\nwho sexually assaulted Mrs. Williams, Felix Kauffman, as a responsible third party with respect\nto the premises liability claim.\n\nThe trial court entered a partial summary judgment in favor of the landlords on the unpaid rent\nclaim. The remaining claims proceeded to trial. At the conclusion of the presentation of evidence,\nthe *358 trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of the landlords and the property manager\non the premises liability claim. Issues concerning the property damage and security deposit claims\nand attorney's fees were submitted to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the landlords on all\nsubmitted claims. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the landlords and property manager\nin accordance with the partial summary judgment, the directed verdict, and the jury's findings.\n\n\n\n                                                  Issues\n\nThe tenants raise seven issues on appeal. The first issue challenges the partial summary judgment\nentered in favor of the landlords on their unpaid rent claim. In their second and third issues, the\ntenants contend that the trial court erred in failing to enter judgment in their favor on their statutory\nsecurity deposit claim as a matter of law. The tenants' fourth issue globally attacks the trial court's\njudgment. The tenants challenge the directed verdict denying their premises liability claim in their\nfifth issue. The tenants' sixth and seventh issues relate to their attempt to set aside the award of\nthe landlords' attorney's fees. We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                               Unpaid Rent\n\n[1] The trial court entered a partial summary judgment in favor of the landlords in the amount\nof $8,850 on their unpaid rent claim.

The\nlandlords filed a traditional motion for summary judgment with respect to their unpaid rent claim.\nIn a summary judgment motion brought under TEX.R. CIV.

Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex.2005).\n\nThe landlords based their claim for unpaid rent on the six-month lease extension that the tenants\nexercised in February 2002. The tenants responded to the motion by asserting that the landlords\nagreed to release them from the extension in the e-mails exchanged between the parties in April\nand May 2002. The tenants submitted a portion of the e-mails as summary judgment evidence to\nsupport their contention. The landlords replied to the tenants' contention by submitting all of the e-\nmails between the parties to support their assertion that the parties did not reach a valid agreement\nto excuse the tenants from the six-month extension.\n\n *359 [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] A modification of a contract must satisfy the elements of a contract:\na meeting of the minds supported by consideration. Hathaway v. Gen. Mills, Inc., 711 S.W.2d\n227, 228 (Tex.1986). Whether a contract is modified depends on the parties' intentions and is a\nquestion of fact. Id. at 228–29. The burden of proving modification rests on the party asserting the\nmodification. Id. at 229. The affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction is a type of contractual\nmodification that rests upon a new contract, express or implied, in which the parties agree to the\ndischarge of the existing obligation by means of a lesser payment tendered and accepted. Jenkins\nv. Henry C. Beck Co., 449 S.W.2d 454, 455 (Tex.1969). Because a valid accord and satisfaction\ndepends upon an agreement, it “only occurs when the parties mutually assent to it,” and their\nintention is a controlling element. McCarty v. Humphrey, 261 S.W. 1015, 1016 (Tex. Comm'n\nApp.1924, judgm't adopted).\n\nA review of all of the e-mails exchanged between the parties during the relevant period\nconclusively establishes that the parties did not mutually assent to the release of the tenants'\nobligations under the six-month extension. The tenants informed the landlords at the outset of the e-\nmails that they would be vacating the house in the near future. The initial communications focused\non a discussion of whether the tenants would be subleasing the property to another tenant during\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   4\n\fWilliams v. Colthurst, 253 S.W.3d 353 (2008)\n\n\n\nthe six-month extension period or if the landlords would be putting the home up for immediate\nsale. The parties discussed the possibility of the tenants vacating the premises at the end of May\n2002 and being released from the remainder of the six-month extension period. However, a dispute\nexisted with respect to the payment of rent for the month of May. The tenants took the position\nthat the security deposit that they made at the beginning of the lease term included the last month's\nrent. Based upon this contention, the tenants asserted that they had already paid May's rent since\nit constituted the last month that they would be occupying the home. The landlords disagreed with\nthis contention and demanded the payment of rent for May.\n\nThe landlords sent the last communication in the exchange of e-mails between the parties on May\n20, 2002. In this e-mail, the landlords advised the tenants as follows: “You are NOT released from\nyour extension until you recieve [sic] written notice of such.... You ARE in breach of your lease,\nand you ARE overdue on your rent for May 2002.” This e-mail conclusively establishes that the\nparties did not mutually agree for the tenants to be released from the six-month extension period.\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err in granting partial summary judgment on the landlords'\nclaim for unpaid rent. The tenants' first issue is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                               Waived Issues\n\n [7] [8] [9] The tenants second and third issues concern their statutory security deposit claim. See\nTEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 92.109 (Vernon 2007). They assert in their second issue that the trial\ncourt erred in denying their motion for partial summary judgment on their statutory security deposit\nclaim. We note, however, that the tenants' statutory security deposit claim was subsequently tried\nto the jury. The general rule is that a denial of a summary judgment cannot be reviewed on appeal.\nSee Cincinnati Life Ins. Co. v. Cates, 927 S.W.2d 623, 625 (Tex.1996). Further, where a motion for\nsummary judgment is denied by the trial court and the case is tried on its merits, the order denying\nthe summary judgment cannot be reviewed on appeal. See *360 Ackermann v. Vordenbaum,\n403 S.W.2d 362, 365 (Tex.1966). 3 Consequently, the trial court's denial of the tenants' motion\nfor partial summary judgment is not reviewable on appeal. The tenants' second issue is overruled.\n\n [10] In their third issue, the tenants assert that the trial court erred in denying their motion for\ndirected verdict. The tenants moved for a directed verdict after the landlords rested their case-in-\nchief on the landlords' property damage claim. After the trial court denied the motion for directed\nverdict, the tenants proceeded with presenting evidence during their case-in-chief and did not\nreurge their motion for directed verdict at the close of the evidence. Therefore, the tenants failed\nto preserve their complaint for appellate review. See 1986 Dodge 150 Pickup v. State, 129 S.W.3d\n180, 183 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2004, no pet.); Horton v. Horton, 965 S.W.2d 78, 86 (Tex.App.-\nFort Worth 1998, no pet.); Cliffs Drilling Co. v. Burrows, 930 S.W.2d 709, 712 (Tex.App.-Houston\n[1st Dist.] 1996, no writ). The tenants' third issue is overruled.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  5\n\fWilliams v. Colthurst, 253 S.W.3d 353 (2008)\n\n\n\n\n                                               Trial Court's Judgment\n\nIn their fourth issue, the tenants globally assert that the judgment entered by the trial court is\n“inconsistent with the evidence presented at trial and is contrary to applicable law.” The tenants\nsupport this contention by making several complaints about the judgment. We address these\ncomplaints separately.\n\n [11] The tenants first contend that the trial court should have disregarded the jury's “no” answers\nto Question Nos. 5 and 7 of the court's charge. Question No. 5 asked the jury if the landlords\n“wrongfully” withheld any portion of the security deposit. Question No. 7 asked the jury to\ndetermine if the landlords “wrongfully” failed to timely provide a written description and itemized\nlist of damages after the tenants surrendered possession of the premises.\n\nSection 92.109 establishes two causes of action that permit a tenant to seek a recovery of his\nsecurity deposit from his landlord. See Pulley v. Milberger, 198 S.W.3d 418, 427–28 (Tex.App.-\nDallas 2006, pet. denied). The first cause of action involves a landlord's bad faith retention of\nthe security deposit and is established in Section 92.109(a). To prevail under this cause of action,\nthe tenant must prove the landlord (1) acted in bad faith and (2) retained the security deposit in\nviolation of the statute. When a landlord is found liable under Section 92.109(a), the tenant may\nrecover from the landlord (1) an amount equal to the sum of $100, (2) three times the portion of\nthe security deposit wrongfully withheld, and (3) the tenant's reasonable attorney's fees in a suit\nto recover the security deposit.\n\nThe second cause of action involves a landlord's bad faith failure to account for the security deposit\nand is established in Section 92.109(b). To prevail under this cause of action, the tenant must\nprove the landlord (1) acted in bad faith and (2) failed to provide the tenant with: (a) a written\ndescription of the damages in violation of the statute and (b) an itemized list of the deductions\nin violation of the statute. A landlord who is found liable under Section 92.109(b): (1) forfeits\nthe right to withhold any portion of the security deposit, (2) forfeits the right to sue the tenant for\ndamages to the premises, and (3) is liable for the tenant's reasonable attorney's *361 fees in a suit\nto recover the security deposit.\n\nQuestion No. 5 contained most of the elements of a cause of action under Section 92.109(a), and\nQuestion No. 7 contained most of the elements of a cause of action under Section 92.109(b).\nParticularly, Question Nos. 5 and 7 omitted the element of bad faith. The court's charge submitted\nthe element of bad faith to the jury in Question No. 8 in the following manner:\n\n   Did the [landlords] act in bad faith?\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    6\n\fWilliams v. Colthurst, 253 S.W.3d 353 (2008)\n\n\n\n\n   (a) In failing to return the [tenants] security deposit on or before the 30th day after they\n      surrendered possession of the premises?\n\n   Answer “Yes” or “No.”\n\n   Answer: No\n\n   (b) In failing to provide a written description and itemization of deductions to the [tenants] on\n      or before the 30th day after they surrendered possession of the premises.\n\n   Answer “Yes” or “No.”\n\n   Answer: No\n\nQuestion No. 8 was not conditioned upon affirmative findings to Question Nos. 5 or 7. Thus, the\njury considered the issue of bad faith on both causes of action set out in Section 92.109 even\nthough the jury had previously determined that the remaining elements of the two statutory causes\nof action did not exist.\n\nBy answering “no” to both parts of Question No. 8, the jury found that the landlords did not act\nin bad faith in either failing to return a portion of the security deposit or providing an accounting\nof property damages. This unchallenged finding 4 precludes our consideration of the tenants'\nevidentiary challenges to Question Nos. 5 and 7. Even if the jury had answered Question Nos.\n5 and 7 in favor of the tenants or if the trial court had disregarded the jury's “no” answers to\nthese questions, the jury's “no” answers to Question No. 8 prevents the tenants from making a\nrecovery on either of their statutory security deposit causes of action. Thus, the jury's determination\nthat the landlords did not act in bad faith renders the jury's answers to Question Nos. 5 and 7\nimmaterial. A question is immaterial when it is rendered immaterial by other findings. See Spencer\nv. Eagle Star Ins. Co. of Am., 876 S.W.2d 154, 157 (Tex.1994). Accordingly, we do not consider\nthe tenants' evidentiary challenges to Question Nos. 5 and 7 because they are not necessary to the\nfinal disposition of the appeal. See TEX.R.APP. P. 47.1.\n\n[12] Moreover, there is evidence that supports the jury's answers to Question Nos. 5, 7, and\n8. The landlords testified that they incurred expenses of $5,198.03 to repair the property after\nthe tenants vacated the premises. This amount exceeded the amount of the security deposit. 5\nAdditionally, the trial court had previously determined that the tenants owed unpaid rent and late\nfees of $8,850. The lease provided that the landlords could deduct unpaid or accelerated rent and\nlate fees from the security deposit. Furthermore, TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 92.107(a) (Vernon\n2007) provides that the landlord is not obligated to return a tenant's security deposit or give the\ntenant a written description of the damages and an itemized list of the deductions until the tenant\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    7\n\fWilliams v. Colthurst, 253 S.W.3d 353 (2008)\n\n\n\ngives the *362 landlord a written statement of the tenant's forwarding address for the purpose of\nreturning the security deposit. See Pulley, 198 S.W.3d at 427–28. DeWitt testified that the tenants\ndid not provide a forwarding address for this purpose. With respect to the issue of the landlords'\nbad faith, there is evidence that the tenants ended communications with the landlords by canceling\ntheir e-mail account prior to vacating the premises. The tenants also did not claim certified mail\nsent to them by the landlords' attorney. The landlords testified that they filed the suit in order to\n“get somebody to talk” to them because they had not had any communication with the tenants\nafter the tenants vacated the property.\n\n [13] [14] The tenants next argue that the trial court's judgment should not have included an\naward of attorney's fees to the landlords for defending the tenants' statutory security deposit claims.\nThe tenants contend that Section 92.109 does not provide for the recovery of a landlord's costs\nfor defending a security deposit claim. Attorney's fees may be recovered from an opposing party\nonly when permitted by statute or by contract. Holland v. Wal–Mart Stores, Inc., 1 S.W.3d 91,\n95 (Tex.1999). The lease executed by the parties contains an attorney's fees provision that reads\nas follows:\n\n   33. ATTORNEY'S FEES: Any person who is a prevailing party in any legal proceeding\n   brought under or related to the transaction described in this Lease is entitled to recover\n   prejudgment interest, attorney's fees, and all other costs of litigation from the nonprevailing\n   party.\n\nPursuant to this provision, the landlords are entitled to recover their attorney's fees incurred\nin successfully defending the security deposit claims because the claims are “related to the\ntransaction” described in the lease.\n\n [15] [16] The tenants next contend that the trial court's judgment should not have awarded\nthe landlords prejudgment interest on their recovery of attorney's fees in the amount of $23,000.\nPrejudgment interest is generally not allowed on an award of attorney's fees. C & H Nationwide,\nInc. v. Thompson, 903 S.W.2d 315, 325 (Tex.1994). However, in A.V.I., Inc. v. Heathington, 842\nS.W.2d 712, 717 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 1992, writ denied), the Amarillo Court of Appeals concluded\nthat prejudgment interest on attorney's fees paid prior to the entry of judgment is recoverable. The\nlandlords filed an affidavit in the trial court showing that they had paid attorney's fees in excess\nof $23,000 prior to the entry of judgment. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in awarding the\nlandlords prejudgment interest on their recovery of attorney's fees.\n\n [17] Next, the tenants attack the award of court costs in the trial court's judgment. They contend\nthat the award of a specific amount of court costs is improper. They additionally assert that the\naward of court costs is not supported by evidence. 6 The tenants' evidentiary challenge is misplaced\nbecause court costs are not an issue for the finder of fact. See Am. Commercial Colls., Inc. v. Davis,\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   8\n\fWilliams v. Colthurst, 253 S.W.3d 353 (2008)\n\n\n\n821 S.W.2d 450, 455 (Tex.App.-Eastland 1991, writ denied) (The right to costs is based entirely\non statutes or procedural rules; the trial court should determine and award costs from the record.).\n\n [18] The court's role is to adjudicate which party or parties are to bear the *363 costs of court,\nnot to determine the correctness of specific items. See Reaugh v. McCollum Exploration Co.,\n140 Tex. 322, 167 S.W.2d 727, 728 (1943); Pitts v. Dallas County Bail Bond Bd., 23 S.W.3d\n407, 417 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2000, pet. denied). Thus, the judgment should not state the amount\ntaxed as costs but only that costs are awarded against a certain party. See Pitts, 23 S.W.3d at\n417. However, the tenants do not challenge the accuracy of the amount of court costs awarded in\nthe final judgment. In the absence of a complaint about the amount of court costs taxed against\nthem, we will not disturb the award of court costs in the judgment. However, if the tenants wish\nto complain about the taxation of any specific costs, the proper remedy is to file a motion to re-tax\ncosts in the trial court. See Operation Rescue–Nat'l v. Planned Parenthood of Houston & Se. Tex.,\nInc., 937 S.W.2d 60, 87 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1996), aff'd as modified, 975 S.W.2d 546,\n570 (Tex.1998).\n\n [19] The tenants' next complaint focuses on the award of the landlords' attorney's fees for\nprosecuting their property damage claim. The jury awarded the landlords $1,858.63 in property\ndamages. The tenants assert that the landlords could not have been prevailing parties under the\nlease's attorney's fee provision because the tenants' security deposit of either $2,450 or $3,900\nexceeded the amount of property damages awarded by the jury. This contention is not consistent\nwith the manner that the parties' presented the property damage question to the jury during closing\narguments. Specifically, both parties argued that the jury's answer to the property damage question\nshould be the amount of damages that the jury determined were in excess of the security deposit\nmade by the tenants. Accordingly, the landlords were prevailing parties on their property damage\nclaim because the jury made an award for property damages in excess of the security deposit made\nby the tenants.\n\n [20] Finally, the tenants argue that they should have been credited with either a payment of $2,450\nor $3,900 toward the judgment's award of prejudgment interest. The tenants base this argument\non the same contention discussed in the preceding paragraph. This argument is misplaced because\nthe award of prejudgment interest is based on amounts ordered to be paid by the tenants in excess\nof their security deposit. The tenants' fourth issue is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                               Premises Liability\n\n [21] In their fifth issue, the tenants challenge the trial court's directed verdict denying their\npremises liability claim. In reviewing the grant of a directed verdict, an appellate court follows the\nstandards for assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence.

We must decide whether there is any evidence of probative value to raise an issue of material\nfact on the question presented. Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex.2001). We\nmust credit the favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could and disregard the contrary evidence\nunless reasonable jurors could not. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827.\n\nAs noted previously, Mrs. Williams was sexually assaulted inside the home on April 16, 2002. Her\nassailant, Felix Kauffman, testified at trial. Kauffman followed her home one day after observing\nher at a fitness club in Tyler. He returned to the home the next day and entered it when no\none was present. Kauffman testified that he entered the home through the unlocked front door.\nHe hid in the house while waiting for Mrs. Williams to return. After Mrs. Williams entered the\nhome, he tackled her inside of the master bedroom. *364 Kauffman immediately blindfolded\nMrs. Williams, and then he sexually assaulted her. The sexual assault ended when Mr. Williams\nreturned home. Kauffman fled the home when Mr. Williams discovered the assault taking place.\n\nThe bedroom where the assault occurred had an exterior door that opened into the backyard. The\ntenants' premises liability claim focuses on the type of lock on the interior side of this door. The\nlock required a key in order for the door to be locked or unlocked from the inside. The tenants\nkept the key to this lock at another location inside the bedroom. The tenants contend that this type\nof lock violated the requirements of TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 92.153 (Vernon 2007) because\nit was not a “keyless bolting device.”\n\nMrs. Williams did not attempt to escape from Kauffman during the attack. She testified that she\nconsidered trying to escape during the attack but that she knew there was no way she could have\nretrieved the key to the door and then used it to open the door. The tenants contend that the type of\nlock on the exterior bedroom door contributed to her decision to submit to the assault. They assert\nthat Mrs. Williams would have had a better chance of escaping from Kauffman if the exterior\nbedroom door had been equipped with a keyless bolting device as required by the statute.\n\n [22] [23] There is a significant body of law in Texas dealing with a landlord's liability for an\nattack on a tenant by a third party occurring on the leased premises. As a rule, a person has no\nlegal duty to protect another from the criminal acts of a third person. Timberwalk Apartments,\nPartners, Inc. v. Cain, 972 S.W.2d 749, 756 (Tex.1998). However, Texas courts have recognized\nan exception to the general rule for a landlord that retains control over the security and safety of\nthe premises. In this situation, the landlord has a duty to use ordinary care to protect tenants from\nthe criminal acts of third parties if the landlord knows or has reason to know of an unreasonable\nand foreseeable risk of harm to the tenant. Id.\n\nIn the typical landlord liability case, the tenant asserts that the landlord's negligence caused him\nor her to be the victim of the criminal act of a third person. The issue of foreseeability is a major\nelement in these cases. Only the general danger, not the sequence of events that produced the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                10\n\fWilliams v. Colthurst, 253 S.W.3d 353 (2008)\n\n\n\nharm, must be foreseeable. Id. The general danger in the typical case is the risk of injury from the\ncriminal activity of third parties. Id. There must be evidence of specific previous crimes on or near\nthe premises in order to establish foreseeability. Id. In determining whether the criminal conduct\nwas foreseeable, the court must consider whether any criminal conduct previously occurred on or\nnear the property, how recently the criminal conduct occurred, how often it occurred, how similar\nthe conduct was to the conduct on the property, and what publicity was given to the occurrences\nto indicate whether the landlord knew or should have known about them. Id. at 757.\n\nThe fact pattern in this appeal differs significantly from the ordinary claim because the tenants\nare not asserting that the landlords and the property manager failed to prevent the assault from\never occurring. Instead, the tenants are contending that the acts and omissions of the landlords\nand the property manager hampered Mrs. Williams's opportunity to escape from the criminal acts\nof a third party. The tenants' claim is, therefore, more complex than the typical landlord liability\ncase because it requires us to consider an additional element to determine the landlords' potential\nliability. This additional element is the matter of evaluating *365 Mrs. Williams's opportunity\nto escape from her attacker.\n\n [24] [25] [26] To prevail on their premises liability claim, the tenants must establish the\nexistence of a duty, a breach of that duty, and damages proximately caused by the breach. W.\nInvs., Inc. v. Urena, 162 S.W.3d 547, 550 (Tex.2005); Doe v. Boys Clubs of Greater Dallas,\nInc., 907 S.W.2d 472, 477 (Tex.1995). We direct our analysis to the element of proximate cause.\nProximate cause has two components: cause in fact and foreseeability. Travis v. City of Mesquite,\n830 S.W.2d 94, 98 (Tex.1992). These elements cannot be established by mere conjecture, guess,\nor speculation. Doe, 907 S.W.2d at 477. The test for cause in fact is whether the act or omission\nwas a substantial factor in causing the injury without which the harm would not have occurred.\nMarathon Corp. v. Pitzner, 106 S.W.3d 724, 727 (Tex.2003). If the defendant's negligence merely\nfurnished a condition that made the injuries possible, there can be no cause in fact. IHS Cedars\nTreatment Ctr. of DeSoto, Tex., Inc. v. Mason, 143 S.W.3d 794, 799 (Tex.2004). In other words,\nthe conduct of the defendant may be too attenuated from the resulting injuries to the plaintiff to\nbe a substantial factor in bringing about the harm. Id.\n\nOur application of the foregoing standards establishes that there is no evidence that the absence\nof a keyless bolting device on the exterior bedroom door proximately caused the tenants' injuries.\nSpecifically, there is no evidence beyond mere conjecture, guess, or speculation that a different\ntype of lock on the bedroom door would have allowed Mrs. Williams to escape from Kauffman's\nsexual assault. The possibility of escaping a physical assault brought about by a criminal\nperpetrator is an inherently speculative matter. Furthermore, the task of predicting the likelihood of\nescaping is particularly speculative when the victim does not attempt to escape his or her attacker.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Colthurst, 253 S.W.3d 353 (2008)\n\n\n\nThe tenants contend that the type of door lock denied Mrs. Williams the “opportunity to [try] to\nescape” by contributing to her decision to submit to the assault. Mrs. Williams testified as follows\nin this regard:\n\n   Q. What do you remember, if anything, occurring to you that caused you not to resist his attack?\n\n   A. What do I remember?\n\n   Q. What do you remember occurring to you at the—at the time you were being attacked that\n   caused you not to resist and try to escape?\n\n   A. Well, number one, I wasn't positive if he had a weapon. And number two, I—for the same\n   reason we talked about. I didn't have anywhere to go. There was nowhere to get if I wanted to.\n\n   Q. What is your opinion of your—the likelihood that you would have looked for an opportunity\n   or pursued an opportunity to escape had you had an idea that you could have gotten out that\n   door?\n\n   A. I—I—I would have, hopefully, taken it. I mean, that's to me—I don't know that answer. I\n   mean, I do know that I knew the door was locked and I couldn't get out that door, because there\n   was no key. But I don't know from then if—if it hadn't been like that, I don't know what—\n\n   Q. Can you—can you tell us whether or not you can honestly say that realizing that the—\n   realizing the type of lock that was there—\n\n   A. Uh-huh (Affirmative)\n\n   Q. —contributed to you submitting to the assault that you suffered?\n\n   A. What is your—say it again. I—I want to make sure I answer—\n\n   *366 Q. Can you tell us whether or not the type of lock that was on that door—\n\n   A. Yes.\n\n   Q. —contributed to you submitting to the assault that you suffered?\n\n   A. Yes.\n\nAs reflected by the foregoing testimony, Mrs. Williams testified that she does not know if she\nwould have tried to escape from Kauffman if the exterior bedroom door had been equipped with\na keyless bolting device. Accordingly, there is no evidence beyond mere speculation that Mrs.\nWilliams would have been able to escape with a different type of door lock. The tenants' fifth\nissue is overruled.\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               12\n\fWilliams v. Colthurst, 253 S.W.3d 353 (2008)\n\n\n\n\n                                        Attorney's Fees and Sanctions\n\nThe tenants' sixth and seventh issues pertain to the landlords' recovery of attorney's fees on their\nunpaid rent claim. The jury awarded the landlords attorney's fees of $10,000 on the rent claim.\nThe landlords' trial counsel testified that they had incurred attorney's fees of $15,000 on the rent\nclaim. On cross-examination, the landlords' trial counsel attributed $5,000 of the $15,000 amount\nto work performed through the point of obtaining the partial summary judgment.\n\nNear the end of the trial, the tenants informed the trial court during a bench conference that they\nwanted to call one of the landlords' other attorneys as a witness. The tenants sought to challenge the\nprevious testimony of the landlords' trial counsel with the testimony of his associate. Specifically,\nthe tenants wanted to introduce an affidavit prepared by the associate regarding the landlords'\nattorney's fees that the landlords attached to their motion for partial summary judgment. The trial\ncourt did not permit the tenants to call the associate attorney as a witness. The trial court also did\nnot permit the tenants to offer the associate's affidavit as an exhibit. 7\n\nThe tenants alleged in their motion for new trial that the testimony of the landlords' trial counsel\nconstituted intrinsic fraud on the basis that it was inconsistent with the matters set out in the\nassociate's affidavit. In response to the motion for new trial, the landlords filed a motion for\nsanctions against the tenants' trial counsel, J. Bennett White, asserting that he lacked a factual basis\nfor the intrinsic fraud allegation. The trial court denied the motion for new trial after conducting a\nhearing on the motion. The trial court also granted the landlords' motion for sanctions by ordering\nWhite to pay the landlords sanctions in the amount of $250.\n\nIn their sixth issue, the tenants assert that the trial court erred in denying the motion for new trial\non the basis of intrinsic fraud. We review a trial court's ruling on a motion for new trial for an\nabuse of discretion. Dir., State Employees Workers' Comp. Div. v. Evans, 889 S.W.2d 266, 268\n(Tex.1994). We begin our analysis by noting that no reporter's record from the hearing on the\nmotion for new trial has been filed in this appeal. In the absence of a record from the hearing, we\nare unable to determine if the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for new trial.\n\nMoreover, the Tyler Court of Appeals has previously addressed the tenants' allegation of intrinsic\nfraud in a mandamus proceeding in In re Williams, No. 12–06–00361–CV, 2007 WL 1241517\n(Tex.App.-Tyler April 30, 2007, orig. proceeding) (mem.op.). The mandamus request arose from\nthe tenants' efforts to obtain the billing records of the landlords' trial counsel *367 by a subpoena\nduces tecum prior to their hearing on their motion for new trial. 2007 WL 1241517, at *1. The\ntrial court quashed the tenants' subpoena duces tecum. Id. The tenants sought an order from\nthe Tyler Court of Appeals compelling the trial court's enforcement of the subpoena so that the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   13\n\fWilliams v. Colthurst, 253 S.W.3d 353 (2008)\n\n\n\nbilling records could be included in the record in this appeal. 8 Id. In reaching its decision to deny\nthe tenants' mandamus request, the Tyler Court of Appeals noted that the tenants “presented no\nevidence of intrinsic fraud at the hearing on their motion for new trial.” Id. In the absence of\na record from the hearing, we are reluctant to disagree with the determination by the Tyler Court\nof Appeals that the tenants presented no evidence of intrinsic fraud. The trial court did not abuse\nits discretion in denying the motion for new trial if the tenants did not present any evidence of\nintrinsic fraud. The tenants' sixth issue is overruled.\n\nThe tenants allege in their seventh issue that the trial court erred in ordering White to pay sanctions.\nThe landlords sought sanctions against White under TEX.R. CIV. P. 13 on the basis that White\ndid not have a good faith basis to allege that the landlords' trial counsel offered false testimony\non the issue of attorney's fees. The landlords sought sanctions in the amount of $500, which they\nalleged constituted their attorney's fees for filing the motion for sanctions. After a hearing, the trial\ncourt granted the motion by ordering White to pay sanctions of $250. We review the imposition\nof Rule 13 sanctions under the abuse of discretion standard. See Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609,\n614 (Tex.2007).\n\n [27] As a preliminary matter, we note that the tenants filed a separate notice of appeal with respect\nto the sanctions order that was entered after the trial court signed the final judgment. However, this\nnotice of appeal does not list White as an appellant. The landlords contend that the tenants lack\nstanding to appeal the sanctions order because it only affects White. In Braden v. Downey, 811\nS.W.2d 922, 928 n. 6 (Tex.1991), the supreme court reserved this question for future consideration.\n(“We express no opinion on the question whether, in order to seek review of sanctions by appeal,\nan attorney must perfect a separate appeal apart from that perfected by his client.”) In the absence\nof an answer to the question in Braden, we agree with the landlords' contention that the tenants\nlack standing to attack the sanctions order. “Texas courts have long held that ... appealing [parties]\nmay not complain of errors that do not injuriously affect [them] or that merely affect the rights of\nothers.” Torrington Co. v. Stutzman, 46 S.W.3d 829, 843 (Tex.2000); Tex. Workers' Comp. Ins.\nFund v. Mandlbauer, 988 S.W.2d 750, 752 (Tex.1999).\n\n [28] Furthermore, the trial court's sanctions order indicates that a hearing was held on the motion\nfor sanctions. However, a record of the hearing has not been filed in this appeal. As was the case\nwith the motion for new trial, without a record of the hearing, we are unable to determine if the\ntrial court abused its discretion in granting sanctions. Additionally, the opinion by the Tyler Court\nof Appeals reveals that White lacked a good faith basis for making the intrinsic fraud allegation\nbecause he did not seek discovery of the landlords' attorney's fees statements during the applicable\ndiscovery period. The tenants' seventh issue is overruled.\n\n*368 [29] Finally, the landlords have filed a motion for further sanctions against White based\nupon the presentation of the tenants' sixth issue. This motion is overruled.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    14\n\fWilliams v.

The landlords' motion for sanctions on appeal is\noverruled.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Mr. Williams did not inform the landlords in his April 20, 2002 e-mail that Mrs. Williams was sexually assaulted inside the home.\n       Instead, Mr. Williams based the tenants' desire to vacate the house on “the sudden death of [Mr. Williams's] father and also a painful\n       event for [Mrs. Williams].”\n2      The partial summary judgment did not address the landlords' recovery of attorney's fees on their unpaid rent claim.\n\n3      The party's remedy is to assign error to the trial court's judgment ultimately rendered following trial on the merits. See Turner v.\n       County of Marion, 549 S.W.2d 254, 255 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1977, writ dism'd).\n4      The tenants have not challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's determination that the landlords did not act\n       in bad faith.\n5      As noted previously, the parties disputed the amount of the security deposit made by the tenants. Based upon the positions taken by\n       the parties, the tenants posted a security deposit of either $3,900, $2,450, or $1,000.\n6      We note that the tenants have not cited any authority in support of their contentions regarding the judgment's award of costs.\n\n7      The arguments presented to the trial court indicated that the tenants did not list the associate as a witness and did not list the associate's\n       affidavit as an exhibit.\n8      The Texas Supreme Court transferred the instant appeal to this court from the Tyler Court of Appeals in a docket control order. The\n       transfer order did not extend to the tenants' subsequent mandamus proceeding.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Namely, the final\n\nsummary judgment granting declaratory relief in favor of Strandhagen\n\nshould be reversed because: (1) Strandhagen was required to establish two\n\nelements to prevail on her affirmative defense, and she conceded her\n\ninability to establish the first element; (2) even if Strandhagen was required\n\nto prove only one element, she failed to conclusively establish the second\n\nelement; (3) Strandhagen did not satisfy her summary-judgment burden of\n\nproof regarding the Physicians’ third-party beneficiary status; and (4) the\n\ntrial court lacked jurisdiction over Strandhagen’s unripe declaratory\n\njudgment claim, and it erred in denying the Physicians’ Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction on this basis.\n\n      Strandhagen offers no response to argument (3) in her Appellee’s\n\nBrief. Based on the argument and authorities presented by the Physicians,\n\nand Strandhagen’s abandonment of this issue, the Court should conclude\n\nthat Strandhagen’s prior argument regarding the Physicians’ third-party-\n\nbeneficiary status does not provide a ground upon which to affirm the\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                      1\n\f     Consequently, the summary judgment must either stand or fall based\n\non Strandhagen’s other ground for unenforceability of the liquidated\n\ndamages provision: her argument that it is a penalty.         Although the\n\nPhysicians maintain their arguments (1) and (4), this Reply Brief focuses on\n\nargument (2). Regardless of the scope of Strandhagen’s burden of proof\n\nand regardless of the claim’s ripeness, the summary judgment should be\n\nreversed because Strandhagen failed to conclusively prove the second\n\nelement of her defense (“unreasonable forecast”).\n\nI.   STRANDHAGEN FAILED TO CONCLUSIVELY ESTABLISH\n     ELEMENT TWO: “UNREASONABLE FORECAST.”\n\n     Strandhagen agrees with the Physicians that, as the party seeking to\n\ninvalidate the liquidated damages clause, she had the summary-judgment\n\nburden to conclusively establish that the clause did not provide a\n\nreasonable forecast of just compensation.            Appellee’s Brief, p.9.\n\nStrandhagen argues that she satisfied this burden by proving that the clause\n\nwas invalid “on its face,” and was therefore excused from the requirement\n\nof proving actual damages in comparison to the liquidated damages\n\namount. Id., p.12-13. This Court should reject her argument because Texas\n\ncase law recognizes only two theories of “facial invalidity” as exceptions to\n\nthe general requirement of proving actual damages, and Strandhagen has\n\n\n                                     2\n\ffailed to conclusively demonstrate that this liquidated damages provision\n\nsatisfies either theory.   Strandhagen offers nothing more than broad\n\nassumptions without any supporting proof.\n\n     A.    General Rule: Proof of Actual Damages is Required.\n\n     Strandhagen’s argument over-generalizes the law regarding facial\n\nchallenges to liquidated damages provisions.      Without specifying the\n\nreasons why certain provisions have been held facially invalid, Strandhagen\n\ncites a string of cases for the implication that a facial challenge broadly\n\nprovides an alternative in every case to the requirement of proving actual\n\ndamages. See id., p.13-14. This is not an accurate assessment of Texas law.\n\nContrary to Strandhagen’s argument, Texas courts have invalidated\n\nliquidated damage provisions based on only two types of facial challenges,\n\nand have oft recognized the limitations of these theories. Infra, Reply\n\nArgument I.B.\n\n     The general rule remains that a party is required to prove an\n\nunreasonable disparity between the amount of actual damages and the\n\namount of liquidated damages to satisfy its burden of proof on the\n\n“unreasonable forecast” element of penalty.     Many cases recognize this\n\ngeneral standard. See Appellants’ Brief, p.23-25 (citing Phillips, Healix,\n\nTriton, Southern Union, and GPA Holdings); see also, e.g., Garden Ridge,\n\n                                    3\n\fL.P. v.

It is undisputed that Strandhagen offered no\n                  proof of actual damages.\n\n      The record plainly demonstrates that Strandhagen offered no\n\nevidence of the amount of any actual damages suffered by the Physicians.\n\nStrandhagen does not contend otherwise. See Appellee’s Brief, p.14. Thus,\n\nthe only way to hold that Strandhagen satisfied her summary-judgment\n\nburden of proof on the “unreasonable forecast” element would be to\n\nconclude that she established, as a matter of law, that the liquidated\n\ndamages provision satisfies a “facial invalidity” exception to the general\n\nrequirement of proving actual damages.       Strandhagen did not do so,\n\nmeaning the summary judgment must be reversed.\n\n      B.    Narrow Exceptions: Two Types of Facial Invalidity.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court has recognized two exceptions in which a\n\nparty may satisfy its burden of proving that a liquidated damages provision\n\nis not a reasonable forecast of just compensation in the absence of proof of\n\nactual damages. These two exceptions arise where the liquidated damages\n\nprovision is deemed unenforceable “on its face” or “as a matter of law”\n\neither because:    (1) the amount of liquidated damages is based on a\n\n\n                                      5\n\fmultiplier of actual damages or (2) the liquidated damages provision is\n\ntriggered by any breach of the contract without regard to the importance or\n\ntriviality of the breach. Strandhagen labels the latter a “one size fits all”\n\nprovision.    The liquidated damages provision in the parties’ Operations\n\nAgreement does not satisfy exception.\n\n             1.   Multiplier of actual damages:\n\n      In Phillips v.

See Appellee’s Brief, p.14\nn.10. Contrary to her argument, the Physicians do not cite Murphy and the\nRESTATEMENT for the proposition that actual damages must be proven in all cases.\nRather, these authorities demonstrate why Strandhagen was required to prove actual\ndamages here because her facial challenge fails. Just as in Murphy, the timing of the\nbreach does not render the clause per se unreasonable, and just as in the RESTATEMENT,\nthe Court’s focus should be on the actual circumstances present here. Appellants’ Brief,\np.8.\n                                           9\n\f     In attempt to overcome the blatant distinction between this case and\n\nthe ones she relies upon, Strandhagen claims that the amount of damages\n\nresulting from this one type of material breach (early departure) “would\n\nobviously be greater the earlier Dr. Strandhagen stopped working at AAT.”\n\nAppellee’s Brief, p.17.   Strandhagen offered no proof to support this\n\nallegedly “obvious” outcome.\n\n     Contrary to Strandhagen’s unsupported conclusion, there is no\n\n“obvious” reason why the damages suffered would vary greatly depending\n\non when she or another physician left the practice.          Following any\n\ndeparture constituting a breach, the practice would be disrupted, suffer a\n\nloss of goodwill, incur scheduling and short-staffing issues, and incur costs\n\nand expenses related to finding a temporary and/or long-term replacement\n\nfor the departed physician—all of which would have a negative impact on\n\nthe group’s profit-making and bonus-earning capabilities. See Appellants’\n\nBrief, p.4-7, 26-27. Whether the departure occurred in year 1 or year 5,\n\nthese negative impacts would be felt for some period of time before a\n\nreplacement physician could be located, trained, and incorporated into the\n\npractice; the goodwill could be rebuilt; and the profitability could be\n\nrestored.\n\n\n\n\n                                     10\n\f     In the absence of any evidence offered by Strandhagen, there is no\n\nway to know what amount of damages would be incurred for a breach at the\n\nstart of the term versus a breach at the end of the term, and certainly no\n\nway to conclude that the damage amounts would be vastly different at\n\neither time. Moreover, without any proof from Strandhagen, there is no\n\nway to conclude that the liquidated amount of $500,000 would be greatly\n\ndisproportionate to the actual damages suffered for any such breach. This\n\nwas Strandhagen’s burden to prove, and she failed to prove it.          The\n\nsummary judgment should be reversed.\n\n     Several cases demonstrate that unsupported conclusions like\n\nStrandhagen’s are insufficient to carry the burden of proof on this type of\n\nfacial challenge.

Without any proof, Strandhagen’s bare conclusion cannot be\n\naccepted in satisfaction of her summary-judgment burden.\n\n     Strandhagen has not cited and the Physicians have not found a single\n\ncase rendering a liquidated damages provision akin to this one\n\nunenforceable on the basis of a “one size fits all” facial challenge.

In Eberts, the\n\nprovision was deemed unenforceable because it would impose the same\n\namount of liquidated damages regardless of whether the breach continued\n\nfor one day or two years. Id. at 864. Here, the liquidated damages are not\n\nimposed upon variable lengths of a “continuing” breach.         Instead, the\n\nbreach would occur at the moment of improper early departure, as\n\nspecified in the contract. As discussed above, the practice would suffer\n\ndisruption and financial hardship for some period of time following that\n\nbreach whether it occurred in year 1 or year 5. Strandhagen offered no\n\nevidence to establish that the length of disruption or magnitude of hardship\n\nwould vary depending on the time of the breach. The liquidated damages\n\nare intended to justly compensate for these negative financial effects,\n\nwhenever incurred.\n\n     C.    Conclusion on “Unreasonable Forecast.”\n\n     To satisfy her summary-judgment burden of proof on the second\n\nelement of her penalty affirmative defense (“unreasonable forecast”),\n\nStrandhagen would generally be required to prove actual damages and\n\n\n\n\n                                     13\n\fdemonstrate an unreasonable disparity between that amount and the\n\nliquidated damages amount. Strandhagen admittedly failed to do so.\n\n     In the alternative, Strandhagen could satisfy her burden of proof by\n\ndemonstrating, as a matter of law, that this liquidated damages provision is\n\ninvalid on its face because it is a “one size fits all” provision. Strandhagen\n\nfailed to carry her burden of proof on this theory because (1) the liquidated\n\ndamages are triggered by only one form of material breach, early departure\n\nfrom the practice under specified circumstances; and (2) Strandhagen\n\noffered nothing beyond speculation to establish that a physician’s early\n\ndeparture would constitute a breach of greater magnitude if it occurred\n\nearlier than later in the physician’s term of employment. Consequently,\n\nStrandhagen has failed to prove that the liquidated damages would be\n\nequally imposed upon breaches of both important and trivial natures.\n\nStrandhagen therefore failed to demonstrate any facial invalidity as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n     Because Strandhagen has failed to satisfy her summary-judgment\n\nburden of proof on the second element of her affirmative defense (and she\n\nconcedes her inability to prove the first element), the summary judgment\n\nshould be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     14\n\fII.

Arguments Made in the Physicians’ Motion for New\n           Trial Were Preserved for Review.\n\n      Strandhagen argues that arguments made by the Physicians for the\n\nfirst time in their Motion for New Trial were not preserved for review.\n\nAppellee’s Brief, p.5, 7, 20. Although it may generally be true that an\n\nargument raised for the first time in a motion for new trial is not preserved,\n\nthere is an exception applicable here.\n\n      “[T]he efficacy of a post-judgment motion to preserve a complaint for\n\nappellate review depends upon whether the trial court affirmatively\n\nconsiders the new grounds and proof as memorialized by a written order.”\n\nCharbonnet v.

(arguments and\n\nevidence presented in motion for reconsideration of summary judgment\n\nwere preserved where order specified that court considered these\n\narguments and evidence). None of the cases cited by Strandhagen in\n                                      15\n\fsupport of her waiver argument reflect that such circumstances were\n\npresent to satisfy this exception; thus, they are distinguishable from this\n\ncase. See Appellee’s Brief, p.21 n.18.\n\n      Strandhagen acknowledges that there was “full briefing and a\n\nhearing” on the arguments raised in the Physicians’ Motion for New Trial.\n\nAppellee’s Brief, p.6. Moreover, the Order Denying the Motion for New\n\nTrial expressly states that the district court “considered the grounds\n\nasserted in the Motion, the Response, the arguments of counsel, the\n\nevidence filed, and the contents of the Court’s file” in making its\n\ndetermination. (CR.271). Because it is apparent from the record that the\n\narguments raised by the Physicians in their Motion for New Trial were\n\nconsidered on their merits and denied, these arguments were preserved for\n\nreview. See generally Tex. R. App. P. 33.1.\n\n      B.    The Physicians “Modification” Argument Was Not an\n            Affirmative Defense.\n\n      The Physicians argued that the severability clause in Section 7(f) of\n\nthe Operations Agreement demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact\n\nabout the interpretation and enforceability of the liquidated damages\n\nprovision. (CR.223) (arguing that “a genuine issue of material fact remains\n\nabout what modified amount or calculation would be reasonable to enforce\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fin[stead of the $500,000 liquidated amount]” based on the severability\n\nclause).\n\n      Contrary to Strandhagen’s argument, the Physicians’ argument did\n\nnot present the affirmative defense of “modification.” See, e.g., Williams v.\n\nColthurst, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1769373\"><a href=\"/opinion/1769373/williams-v-colthurst/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 359 (Tex.

The second is that there existed the same degree of\n\nmutuality and meeting of the minds as was present for the original\n\ncontract.”) (collecting cases; citations omitted).\n\n      The Physicians were in no way seeking to avoid the enforcement of\n\nthe parties’ contract by arguing that the parties had reached a new,\n\nmodified agreement supported by sufficient consideration, as would be the\n\ncase under the affirmative defense of modification. Instead, the Physicians\n\nwere simply arguing that Strandhagen failed to carry her traditional\n\nsummary-judgment burden because a genuine issue of material fact existed\n\n\n                                       17\n\fwithin the four corners of the Operations Agreement, which was part of the\n\noriginal summary-judgment record.

Strandhagen Cannot Use the Declaratory Judgment\n             Act to Create Jurisdiction.\n\n        Strandhagen argues that a live controversy sufficient to support\n\njurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgments Act (“DJA”) exists based on\n\nthe arguments presented by the Physicians to this Court regarding the\n\nproper interpretation of the liquidated damages provision.

[the Physicians] and perhaps others are\n\nseeking to pursue her for collection.” (CR.8, 12). In reality, the Physicians\n\nnever took any action to pursue a claim against her. If there was any\n\nevidence that the Physicians had done so, Strandhagen surely would have\n\npresented that evidence to the district court to demonstrate jurisdiction.\n\nShe now blames the Physicians for being unable to prove a negative.\n\n      Before      any   actual   dispute    or   controversy   ripened   between\n\nStrandhagen and the Physicians, Strandhagen filed this preemptive suit,\n\nwhich the Physicians were then forced to answer and defend. At that time,\n\nan active controversy existed between Strandhagen and her employer\n\n\n                                           19\n\f(AAT) regarding whether or not she had been terminated for cause.\n\n(CR.39, 80, 85-87, 91-93, 144). The Physicians were entitled to wait and\n\nsee how that issue developed and/or was resolved before deciding whether\n\nto pursue a claim against Strandhagen because her early departure would\n\nnot be considered a breach of the Operations Agreement if it resulted from\n\nAAT’s termination of her employment without cause. (CR.168). On this\n\nbasis, when Strandhagen filed suit against the Physicians, their\n\ndetermination about whether or not to pursue a claim against Strandhagen\n\nremained an open, theoretical issue. 2\n\n      The fact that the Physicians have defended the validity of their\n\ncontractual language does not demonstrate that a sufficiently ripe claim for\n\nbreach of contract existed at the time Strandhagen filed suit for purposes of\n\njurisdiction. The trial court erred in denying the Physicians’ Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction and in granting Strandhagen’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n\non this basis.\n\n\n\n2      Strandhagen cites to page 8 of Appellants’ Brief as proof of that an allegedly ripe\ncontroversy existed. Appellee’s Brief, p.26. She claims the Physicians “admit[ted]” that\nher employment was terminated “under circumstances where they contend she ‘would\nbe liable for payment of liquidated damages.’” Id. Rather than “acknowledging” the\nexistence of a ripe controversy, the Physicians argument is presented in hypothetical\nterms: “If [it] were true [that Strandhagen was terminated on the basis of\ndiscrimination] it would provide [an] exception to her liability under the liquidated\ndamages provision. . . . [On the other hand, if the Company were correct that]\nStrandhagen quit or was terminated with cause in September 2013 . . . [then she] would\nbe liable for payment of liquidated damages.” Appellants’ Brief, p.8.\n                                           20\n\f                                  PRAYER\n      Based on the foregoing, Appellants respectfully pray that this Court\n\nsustain both of their issues on appeal and reverse the district court’s grant\n\nof Strandhagen’s Motion for Summary Judgment, its partial denial of the\n\nPhysicians’ Plea to the Jurisdiction, and its denial of the Physicians’ Motion\n\nfor New Trial. If the jurisdictional ruling is reversed, then this Court should\n\nrender judgment in favor of the Physicians dismissing Strandhagen’s claim\n\nin its entirety.

We will affirm\nthe judgment.\n\n\n\n                                            BACKGROUND\n\nAppellant Ayeni operated a convenience store out of his residence in Houston, Texas. The\nComptroller conducted a sales-tax audit of Ayeni's business for the period covering January 1,\n2004, through December 31, 2006. Ayeni acknowledges that he “did not keep a good record of his\nbusiness documents,” 1 and in the absence of such records, the Comptroller resorted to estimating\nAyeni's sales and tax liability from records of Ayeni's beer purchases obtained from certain of his\nvendors and industry sales averages. 2 Through these calculations, the Comptroller determined\nthat Ayeni owed the appellee taxing authorities 3 approximately $48,000 in unpaid sales taxes for\nthe audit period, penalties, and interest.\n\nAfter Ayeni failed to pay the determination, the Comptroller issued a certificate of tax delinquency\nto the Attorney General's office for collection. The Attorney General subsequently sued Ayeni\non appellees' behalf to recover the delinquent sales taxes, penalties, and interest as set forth in\nthe Comptroller's certificate of deficiency, plus attorney's fees. Ayeni filed a general denial, later\namended to a verified denial. Appellees filed a traditional motion for summary judgment on all\nof their claims, attaching as evidence the Comptroller's certificate and an affidavit from appellees'\ncounsel averring that they had incurred $7,500 in attorney's fees in the proceeding. Ayeni filed\na response to appellees' motion and a supplement, presenting affidavits *709 from himself and\nhis bookkeeper in which each disputed the accuracy of the Comptroller's tax calculations and\nunderlying estimates of Ayeni's beer sales. In further support, Ayeni attached numerous receipts\nthat purported to reflect actual beer purchases by Ayeni. Ayeni also presented an affidavit from\nhis counsel attempting to controvert appellees' attorney's fees affidavit.\n\nFollowing a hearing, the district court granted partial summary judgment that Ayeni was liable\nfor the deficiency in the certified amount. However, it denied appellees' motion on their claim for\nattorney's fees.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   2\n\fAyeni v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013)\n\n\n\nAyeni filed a motion to reconsider the partial summary judgment, attaching additional documents\nfrom the Comptroller reflecting the Comptroller's methodology in estimating the sales taxes Ayeni\nowed. Following a hearing, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration by written\norder. To ensure “a clear appellate record,” the order further specified that the district court had\nultimately considered the entirety of the evidence and arguments Ayeni had filed in the case in\nits summary-judgment ruling.\n\nSubsequently, the district court signed a final judgment incorporating its earlier partial summary\njudgment and awarding appellees $2,000 in attorney's fees. 4 It is from this final judgment that\nAyeni now appeals.\n\n\n\n                                               ANALYSIS\n\nAyeni seeks reversal of the district court's judgment in four issues that claim error in the summary-\njudgment ruling. In his first two issues, Ayeni asserts that he presented summary-judgment\nevidence of his tax liability that controverted the Comptroller's certificate and raised a fact issue\nthat precluded summary judgment for appellees. In his third issue, Ayeni insists that the district\ncourt erred or abused its discretion by granting partial summary judgment when appellees had\ninstead sought a final summary judgment. In his fourth issue, Ayeni argues that the Comptroller's\ncertificate of delinquency could not support summary judgment in appellees' favor in the face of\nAyeni's verified denial.\n\n\nStandard of review\nThe standards of review for summary judgments are well established. We review the summary-\njudgment motion and response, if any, de novo to determine if the competent summary-judgment\nevidence included with those pleadings shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\nand the movant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c);\nValence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894667\"><a href=\"/opinion/894667/valence-operating-co-v-dorsett/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 661 (Tex.2005). We take as true all evidence\nfavorable to the non-movant, and we indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts\nin the non-movant's favor. See Valence, 164 S.W.3d at 661.\n\n [1] Where, as here, the movant relies on the “traditional” summary-judgment standard, the\nmovant has the initial burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material fact and\nthat he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See M.D. Anderson Hosp. & Tumor Inst.\nv. Willrich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1755090\"><a href=\"/opinion/1755090/md-anderson-hosp-tumor-inst-v-willrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (Tex.2000) (per curiam). Assuming this burden is met, and only if\nit is, the burden shifts to the non-movant to present evidence raising a genuine issue of material\nfact as to the movant's claims. See id. If the non-movant's evidence raises a fact issue, summary\njudgment is not appropriate. See id.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See id. To meet their burden as to Ayeni's sales tax liability, appellees relied\nsolely on the Comptroller's certificate of delinquency. As Ayeni acknowledges, subsection (a) of\ntax code section 111.013 makes the Comptroller's certificate—\n\n   ... prima facie evidence of:\n\n   (1) the stated tax or amount of the tax, after all just and lawful offsets, payments, and credits\n      have been allowed;\n\n   (2) the stated amount of penalties and interest;\n\n   (3) the delinquency of the amounts; and\n\n   (4) the compliance of the comptroller with the applicable provisions of this code in computing\n      and determining the amount due.\n\nTex. Tax Code Ann. § 111.013(a) (West 2008). Consequently, it is well established that a\nComptroller's certificate of delinquency suffices to meet a taxing authority's initial summary-\njudgment burden in a sales-tax deficiency suit, shifting the burden to the taxpayer to raise a fact\nissue in order to avoid summary judgment. See N.S. Sportswear, Inc. v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1663598\"><a href=\"/opinion/1663598/ns-sportswear-inc-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n232 (Tex.App.-Austin 1991, no writ) (“If unrebutted, [Comptroller's certificates of deficiency] are\nsufficient to establish, as a matter of law, the amount of tax the taxpayer owes.” (citing Baker v.\nBullock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1781028\"><a href=\"/opinion/1781028/baker-v-bullock/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1975, writ ref'd n.r.e.))). But Ayeni argues\nthat his verified denial of appellee's claims served to rebut or join issue with the Comptroller's\ncertificate, such that its prima facie or presumptive validity effectively disappeared, returning\nappellees to their status quo ante—and leaving appellees lacking in any summary-judgment proof\nto meet their initial burden. We disagree that Ayeni's verified denial had this effect.\n\nAyeni emphasizes subsection (b) of tax code section 111.013, which states:\n\n            The defendant may not deny a claim for taxes, penalties, or interest unless the\n            defendant timely files a sworn written denial that specifically identifies the taxes,\n            penalties, and interest the defendant asserts are not due and the amounts of tax,\n            penalties, and interest that are not due.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Tax Code Ann. § 111.013(b). Ayeni suggests that subsection (b), read together with\nsubsection (a)'s provisions describing the prima facie effect of the Comptroller's certificate, means\nthat the filing of a verified denial under subsection (b) rebuts or negates the prime facie effect\nof a Comptroller's certificate under subsection (a), much like a verified denial in a suit on sworn\naccount. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 185; Rizk v. Financial Guardian Ins. Agency, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1757927\"><a href=\"/opinion/1757927/rizk-v-financial-guardian-ins-agency-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n862 (Tex.1979) (“It is settled ... that a defendant's verified denial of the correctness of a plaintiff's\nsworn account in the form required by Rule 185 destroys the evidentiary effect of the itemized\naccount attached to the petition and forces the plaintiff to put on proof of his claim.”). However,\nunlike the rules governing suits on sworn accounts, nothing in section 111.013 says that subsection\n(b)'s verified denial has any impact on the operation and effect of subsection (a)'s Comptroller's\ncertificate. Cf. Tex.R. Civ. P. 185 (providing affidavit on sworn account is “prima facie evidence\n[of the account], unless the party resisting such claim shall file a written denial, under oath”). Nor\ncan Ayeni point to any Texas court that has said it does.\n\n *711 Neither subsection (a) or (b) references the other, and we can only conclude that both\nprovisions must be given the effect the Legislature prescribes within each. Subsection (b) is in\nthe nature of a pleading requirement with which defendants in sales-tax deficiency cases must\ncomply in order to join issue with the taxing authority's petition; otherwise, the taxpayer loses by\ndefault. See Noorani Gas & Convenience, Inc. v. State, No. 03–06–00463–CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1827605</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nat *5 (Tex.App.-Austin Apr. 24, 2008, no pet) (mem. op.). In contrast, subsection (a) speaks to\nthe evidence on which the taxing authority may rely to meet its burden of proof if and when its\npleadings are placed at issue by a verified denial. And the Legislature in subsection (a) has made\nComptroller's certificates of deficiency prima facie evidence without preconditions. See Tex. Tax\nCode Ann. § 111.013(a). Accordingly, Ayeni's verified denial does not affect the prima facie\nevidentiary nature of the Comptroller's certificate of deficiency in this case. We overrule Ayeni's\nfourth issue on appeal.\n\n\nControverting proof\nBecause appellees attached the Comptroller's certificate of deficiency to their summary-judgment\nmotion and it is sufficient to meet their initial summary-judgment burden, the burden shifted to\nAyeni to raise a question of fact as to the amount of taxes, penalties, and interest he owed for the\naudit period at issue or as to the Comptroller's compliance with the applicable provisions of the tax\ncode in computing and determining the amount due. See id.; N.S. Sportswear, Inc., 819 S.W.2d at\n232. Appellees have urged that Ayeni had to do more than present the legally sufficient contrary\nevidence that is ordinarily required on summary judgment. In their view, Ayeni was required to\nadduce conclusive contrary evidence—i.e., prove as a matter of law that he did not owe the amount\nthe Comptroller certified—in order to preclude summary judgment based on the certification. In\nhis second issue, Ayeni disputes appellees' view of his summary-judgment burden, urging that he\nwas required to present only summary-judgment evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                      5\n\fAyeni v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013)\n\n\n\nmaterial fact regarding his tax liability, not conclusive evidence. In his first issue, Ayeni argues\nthat his summary-judgment proof is sufficient to raise a fact issue and even rises to the level of\nconclusive contrary evidence.\n\nWe need not address Ayeni's second issue because we conclude that he has not presented\ncompetent evidence sufficient to raise a fact issue even under the customary summary-judgment\nburdens. In an attempt to raise a fact issue, Ayeni submitted his and his bookkeeper's affidavits,\nsales-tax returns for 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and the first quarter of 2010, and various\nreceipts from beer vendors dated between 2004 and 2006. Ayeni's affidavit stated that he did not\nowe the taxes, penalties, and interest claimed by the Comptroller because those amounts were\n“based on incorrect taxable sale amounts.” He then averred that the correct taxable sale amounts\nwere set forth in the sales-tax returns attached to his summary-judgment response. Finally, Ayeni\nstated in his affidavit that the Comptroller incorrectly estimated his beer sales for the audit period\nand that his records showed that he made gross beer purchases of $8,827.11 in 2004, $5,681.99\nin 2005, and $6,622.02 in 2006.\n\nSimilarly, Ayeni's bookkeeper testified in his affidavit that Ayeni did not owe the amounts\nestablished by the Comptroller's certificate of deficiency because those amounts were based on\nincorrect taxable sale amounts. The correct amount of taxes owed, the bookkeeper averred, were\nset forth in the attached sales-tax returns and vendor receipts, which returns the bookkeeper *712\nprepared in the regular course of Ayeni's business. Finally, Ayeni's bookkeeper reiterated Ayeni's\ncontentions regarding the gross purchases of beer made by Ayeni in 2004, 2005, and 2006.\n\n [3] [4] The affidavit testimony that the Comptroller's amounts are incorrect and that Ayeni's\namounts are correct are bare conclusions unsupported by facts. These statements are thus\nincompetent summary-judgment evidence. To be competent summary-judgment evidence, an\naffidavit must contain specific factual bases, admissible in evidence, upon which its conclusions\nare based. Brownlee v. Brownlee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1505453\"><a href=\"/opinion/1505453/brownlee-v-brownlee/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 112 (Tex.1984); see Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(f)\n(affidavits “shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence”). The same is true of\naffidavit assertions that the Comptroller's estimates of his beer sales are incorrect: Although Ayeni\ndoes offer that “his records showed” that he made gross beer purchases of $8,827.11 in 2004,\n$5,681.99 in 2005, and $6,622.02 in 2006” and he includes some of those purchase receipts, he\ndoes not assert that those were his total purchases of taxable items during that period or state with\nany specificity how the Comptroller's numbers were incorrect. More important, Ayeni's affidavits\ndo not state what Ayeni's total sales amounts were for the period at issue, which amounts are,\nby statute, the basis for determining sales tax owed. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 151.051 (West\n2008) (imposing sales tax based on a percentage of sale price). To that extent, even if the affidavits\nwere competent summary-judgment evidence, they do not raise a question of fact as to the correct\namount of sales taxes owed. Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of the appellees was proper.\nWe overrule Ayeni's first issue.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

But rule 166a explicitly permits a trial court to grant a partial summary\njudgment:\n\n   Case not Fully Adjudicated on Motion. If summary judgment is not rendered upon the whole\n   case or for all the relief asked and a trial is necessary, the judge may at the hearing examine the\n   pleadings and the evidence on file, interrogate counsel, ascertain what material fact issues exist\n   and make an order specifying the facts that are established as a matter of law, and directing such\n   further proceedings in the action as are just.\n\nTex.R. Civ. P. 166a(e). Here, the Comptroller sought summary judgment on two claims—\na claim seeking delinquent sales taxes owed and a claim for attorney's fees—but the district\ncourt determined that the Comptroller met its summary-judgment burden only as to its claim\nfor sales taxes owed and not as to its claim for attorney's fees.

While it was ultimately\nunnecessary for us to reach that issue here, it nonetheless warrants emphasis that Ayeni has\nidentified an aberration in this Court's past jurisprudence addressing the effect of Comptroller\ncertificates of deficiency and how a taxpayer can oppose a summary-judgment motion predicated\non one.\n\nThe notion that a taxpayer must present conclusive contrary evidence to rebut a Comptroller's\ncertificate of deficiency does not find explicit textual support in the current tax code. Subsection\n(a) of section 111.013 states only that the Comptroller's certificate is “prima facie evidence” of\nthe taxes, penalties, and interest due, the delinquency of those amounts, and of the comptroller's\ncompliance with the tax code. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 111.013(a) (West 2008). “Prima facie” is\nLatin for “first view,” 1 and “prima facie evidence” typically denotes evidence that is determinative\nof a fact's or facts' existence, sometimes stated in terms of giving rise to a “presumption” of their\nexistence, unless and until some contrary evidence is presented.

See id. at 858. The defendant insurance carrier asserted\nthat the decedent's life-insurance policy had lapsed prior to the insured's death due to the insured's\nfailure to make a premium payment that had come due. The case went to trial, at which the plaintiff\nbeneficiary presented detailed evidence that the decedent had properly stamped, addressed, and\nmailed the premium payment to the insurance company prior to its final due date. This evidence\ngave rise to the legal presumption that the insurance company had received the payment. See id.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In response, the insurance company presented evidence that it had not received\nthe premium payment. Id. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff beneficiary.\n\nOn appeal to the Waco Court of Civil Appeals, the insurance company asserted, among other\npoints, that the evidence did not support a finding that the premium payment had been timely\npaid. See Southland Life Ins. Co. v. Greenwade, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 650–51 (Tex.Civ.App.-Waco\n1940), reversed by 159 S.W.2d at 858. Specifically, the insurance company argued that because it\nhad produced evidence that it had never actually received the premium, both the presumption of\nreceipt and the foundational evidence supporting that presumption—i.e., that the payment letter\nhad been properly stamped, addressed, and mailed to the company—“disappeared” such that the\ntrier of fact could no longer consider it; thus leaving the plaintiff without any proof of receipt. See\nid. at 650. The Waco court overruled that issue, holding that even in the face of evidence of non-\nreceipt, the presumption of receipt “continued as evidence” that was sufficient to support the trial\ncourt's judgment. See id. at 650.\n\nOn appeal, although ultimately affirming the trial court's judgment and holding that the evidence\nwas sufficient to support a finding that the premium check had been timely received, the supreme\ncourt explicitly rejected the Waco court's view that a presumption like that of receipt could itself\nbe considered evidence. Instead, the supreme court held that a presumption is not evidence and\nthat it disappears once “substantial contrary evidence” is offered by the party against whom the\npresumption operates. See Southland Life, 159 S.W.2d at 857 (citing Wigmore on Evidence, 2d\ned., § 2491); see also General Motors Corp. v. Saenz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2433144\"><a href=\"/opinion/2433144/gmc-v-saenz-on-behalf-of-saenz/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 359 (Tex.1993) (“Once ...\nevidence contradicting the presumption has been offered, the presumption disappears.”). But the\ncourt then went on to clarify that the evidence that gave rise to the presumption could still be\nconsidered and weighed by the fact-finder, vis-à-vis the carrier's contrary evidence, as evidence\nthat the premium payment had, in fact, been timely received. Southland Life, 159 S.W.2d at\n857; see Saenz, 873 S.W.2d at 359. In other words, although the insurance company had offered\nevidence that it had not timely received the payment, thus eliminating the presumption of receipt,\nthe trier of fact could still consider the facts underlying the presumption-i.e., that the defendant\nstamped, addressed, and mailed the payment letter to the company-as themselves *715 evidence\nthat the insurance company received the payment. See Southland Life, 159 S.W.2d at 857. And,\nrelying on this evidence of payment, the supreme court went on to hold that the evidence was\nsufficient to support the trial court's finding that the payment was timely received. See id.\n\nThe court in Southland Life then went on to observe that there might be circumstances where the\npresumption's foundational facts could not be considered—i.e., would not support an affirmative\nfinding—by the trier of fact:\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In other words, if the party against\nwhom the presumption of receipt operates presents evidence that conclusively negates receipt\nof the mail, both the presumption of receipt and the probative value of any proof of underlying\nfacts could be said to “disappear” because the evidence, by definition, is legally insufficient to\nsupport a finding of receipt. This amounts merely to an observation about the nature of conclusive\nevidence that negates a fact's existence. See City of Keller v.

This Court has continued to\ndescribe the taxpayer's burden at trial in similar terms. 6 To the *716 extent such descriptions refer\nto the concepts that a Comptroller's certificate, even if met with the taxpayer's contrary evidence,\nmay nonetheless be legally sufficient to support a fact finding of tax liability unless the taxpayer's\ncontrary evidence is conclusive, it is merely an application of the principles described in Southland\nLife. In any event, Ayeni does not quarrel with the notion that he would be required, at least\npractically speaking, to present conclusive contrary evidence in order to overcome the effect of a\nComptroller's certificate at trial on the merits.

I agree.\n\nThe notion that a taxpayer nonmovant must counter a Comptroller's certificate with conclusive\ncontrary evidence in order to preclude summary judgment traces back to a 2004 memorandum\nopinion of this Court, Wimmer v. State, No. 03–03–00135–CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">210629</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3–4\n(Tex.App.-Austin Feb. 5, 2004, pet. denied) (mem. op.).

For support, this Court cited Smith\nand its progeny-again, cases that involved trials on the merits. See id. at *3–4 (citing Sundown\nFarms, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 293 (Tex.App.-Austin 2002, no pet.); Hylton v.

In fact, the supreme court held in Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad that the\ntaxing authority, which enjoyed a number of presumptions in its favor, including that its property\nvaluations were valid, must nevertheless “ ‘establish [its] entitlement to a summary judgment on\nthe issues expressly presented to the trial court by conclusively proving all essential elements of\n[its] cause of action or defense as a matter of law.’ ” Id.

Thus, even if the taxpayer's burden of proof at\ntrial requires him to produce conclusive evidence to prevail on the merits, he must only produce\nevidence sufficient to raise a question of fact as to the taxing authority's claim in order to avoid\nsummary judgment.\n\nNonetheless, because Ayeni has not presented competent contrary summary-judgment evidence\nthat would even meet the customary burden of a summary-judgment nonmovant, this is not the\ncase in which this Court should undertake to reexamine the suspect holdings of Wimmer and any\nprogeny en banc. 8 But that case will come along inevitably, so I leave this writing as a place\nmarker for that day. Alternatively, the Legislature could, of course, provide statutory clarification\nthat would obviate the need for any such reexamination.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Cf. Tex.

The principal issue on appeal is whether a provision in the written\ncontract in question should be construed as a liquidated damage provision or whether it is a penalty\nprovision which may not be enforced by appellant as liquidated damages. Other points of error\nasserted by appellant William J. Bethel, Jr. d/b/a Ra-Comm Electronics relating to attorney's fees\nand pre-judgment interest and cross points by appellee Butler Drilling Corporation are discussed\nbelow. We reform the judgment of the trial court to provide for pre-judgment interest from October\n1, 1977, on the sum of $10,189.72, and otherwise affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nThe appellant was originally engaged by Butler Drilling Company to perform certain motor vehicle\nradio maintenance and repair duties for appellee. From 1967 to 1974 appellant operated under\nan oral month to month agreement. By contract dated August 28, 1974, appellant and Butler\nDrilling Company entered into a written contract to perform such motor vehicle radio repairs and\nmaintenance on a twenty-four hour on-call basis. The services provided for under the contract were\nexclusive as to appellee but non-exclusive as to appellant. The contract was signed by appellant\nWilliam J. Bethel, Jr., and for Butler Drilling Company was signed by its president, Duncan Butler,\nwith a notary acknowledgment also dated August 28, 1974. On October 1, 1974, Butler Drilling\nCompany sold its assets to Mitchell Energy Corporation and Butler Drilling Corporation became\nthe successor corporation. Duncan Butler also served as president of the successor corporation. The\ncontract provided that employment of appellant would continue for a period of three consecutive\nyears beginning September 1, 1974, and ending August 31, 1977. Appellant would be paid in\nspecified semi-monthly installments with the amount of such payments to increase yearly in\nspecified sums. Additional labor performed by appellant would be billed and paid for at an hourly\nrate of $10 per hour. Appellee agreed to provide either a vehicle or travel reimbursement to\nappellant as well as shop space, utilities and parking facilities. Appellee further agreed to furnish\nall repair and replacement parts; appellant was to purchase these parts and bill appellee monthly\nfor them at cost plus fifteen percent. The contract contained the following *837 provisions which\nrelate to the liquidated damages claimed by appellant in this appeal:\n\n            “Because the services to be performed by Ra-Comm are personal services, the\n            death of William J. Bethel, Jr., or such bad health or accident as shall render him\n            unable to fully perform said services, shall be grounds to relieve both parties\n            from any further obligations concerning the contract. In the event that Butler\n            breaches the contract and fails to perform for any reasons other than those set\n            out above, then it shall pay as liquidated damages to Ra-Comm the balance of\n            the monthly installment payments set out above.”\n\nIt was undisputed the contract was terminated by appellee on October 24, 1975, but there was a\ndispute as to whether such termination was with or without good cause. The jury found in answer\nto special issues that Butler Drilling Corporation assumed and ratified appellant's contract with\nButler Drilling Company, that appellant was an independent contractor from October 1, 1974 to\nOctober 24, 1975, that appellant was terminated, that Butler Drilling Corporation did not have\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court on appellee's Motion disregarded the jury finding that appellant did not\nconvert any of appellee's assets and rendered final judgment in favor of appellant for $10,189.72\nby taking the jury's damage answer of $14,500.00 and subtracting the conversion offset admitted\nby appellant in the amount of $4,310.28.\n\nThe court also awarded $12,000.00 in attorney's fees on the jury finding, and denied appellant's\nMotion for Judgment on attorney's fees of $16,500.00. The court further refused appellant's Motion\nfor Judgment for liquidated damages of $41,825.00 and pre-judgment interest on the liquidated\nsum. From this final judgment appellant appeals.\n\nAppellant's seven points of error are that the trial court erred in denying appellant's Motion for\nJudgment for liquidated damages provided by the contract and that there was no evidence and\ninsufficient evidence to prove the liquidated damage clause was a penalty; that the trial court erred\nin denying appellant's Motion for Judgment for $16,500.00 attorney's fees and that there was no\nevidence and insufficient evidence to support the jury finding of $12,000.00 attorney's fees; and\nthat the trial court erred in not awarding pre-judgment interest from January 1, 1976.\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] With respect to appellant's first three points of error, we construe the\nlanguage employed in the contract in question to be a penalty, as a matter of law as pleaded by\nthe appellee in its trial pleading, and as construed by the trial court, rather than a valid liquidated\ndamage provision as contended by appellant. The liquidated damage provision is not triggered\nsolely by contract termination and nonpayment of monthly rentals by Butler. The liquidated\ndamage provision was not carefully drawn and as it was written, it applied equally to any breach of\nany provision of the contract by appellee irrespective of the importance or triviality of such breach.\nThe liquidated damage provision of the contract in question, as written, would apply with equal\nforce for such trivial breaches by appellee Butler as failing to pay utilities, provide parking space\nor pay an additional hourly labor charge of $10.00. Under the liquidated damage clause as written,\nappellant would be entitled to the full amount of monthly payments for the full term of the contract\nirrespective of the nature of the breach or appellant's actual loss or damage. Because the contract\nprovides the same reparation *838 for the breach of a trivial or comparatively unimportant\nstipulation as for the breach of the most important one or of the whole contract, we hold that the\nparties have not adhered to the rule of just compensation and that the provision is a penalty. The\nleading case on the subject is Stewart v.

The lease contract of the parties included a liquidated damage\nprovision that provided “(t)he failure of Lessee to make said payment or payments or the breach\nof this contract otherwise by him shall render him liable to Lessors, as agreed liquidated damages,\nthe sum of One Hundred Fifty ($150) Dollars per month for each and every month of the unexpired\nterm...” (Emphasis added.) Stewart v. Basey, supra at 485. In holding that such stipulated damage\nprovision would be treated as a penalty the Texas Supreme Court pointed out that the liquidated\ndamage provision was not carefully drawn and was not limited to the breach of any one particular\ncovenant, but rather provided for the same reparation for the breach of a trivial or comparatively\nunimportant stipulation as for the breach of the most important one of the contract. Therefore, the\nSupreme Court reasoned, the provision did not adhere to the rule of just compensation. The court\nthen reversed and remanded the case to determine the amount of actual damages to which lessor\nwas entitled for the breach. The court emphasized that damages to be enforceable as liquidated\ndamages must be uncertain and the stipulation must be reasonable. The right of competent parties\nto make their own bargains is not unlimited. The universal rule for measuring damages for the\nbreach of a contract is just compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained. A party has no\nright to have a court enforce a stipulation which violates the principle underlying the rule. Again,\nthe Supreme Court in Stewart v. Basey, supra, at 486, stated:\n\n   “The true theory is well expressed in Williston on Contracts, Revised Edition, Sec. 779, p.\n   2192, in this language: ‘But as has been seen, the chief, almost the only, means of determining\n   whether the parties in good faith endeavored to assess the damages is afforded by the amount\n   of damages stipulated for, and the nature of the breach upon which the stipulation was agreed\n   to become operative...’ ”\n\nFinally, the Supreme Court quoted from the comments from Restatement of Contracts, Sec. 339,\nsubsection (1) as follows:\n\n            “b. Contracts are frequently made in which performance of very different\n            degrees of importance and value are promised and one large sum of money\n            is made payable as damages for any breach whatever. Since such a contract\n            promises the same reparation for the breach of a trivial or comparatively\n            unimportant stipulation as for the breach of the most important one or of\n            the whole contract, it is obvious the parties have not adhered to the rule of\n            just compensation. In this matter neither the intention of the parties nor their\n            expression of intention is the governing consideration. The payment promised\n            may be a penalty, though described expressly as liquidated damages, and vice\n            versa.”\n\nAppellant here urges that the liquidated damage provision in the contract in question should be\nenforced in this case because of the contract termination by appellee without good cause and\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We recognize it is a stringent case on the facts from appellant's viewpoint, but we do not\nbelieve that we are empowered to pick and choose which breaches are enforceable by liquidated\ndamages since the provision plainly states it is applicable to all breaches of the contract and the\nSupreme Court in Stewart v.

Further, there was no defensive pleading that it was a penalty and such defense was\nwaived. Appellant's first three points of error are overruled.\n\n [6] [7] Appellant contends by his next three points of error that the trial court erred in denying\nappellant's Motion for Judgment for attorney's fees in the amount of $16,500 and allowing only\n$12,000 attorney's fees on the jury finding, because there was no evidence or insufficient evidence\nto support such finding. Appellant's trial attorney testified that he was familiar with fees charged\nfor services similar to those rendered in this case and that “it is my opinion that ... a proper legal fee\nand reasonable fee for the same or similar circumstances in Harris County would be approximately\n$16,500.” There was no cross-examination of the witness nor was there any contradictory attorney\nfee expert opinion evidence produced by appellee. The jury found $12,000 would be a reasonable\nattorney's fee. Appellant recognizes the unbroken long line of case authority holding that the\namount of attorney's fees is a fact issue even when no contradictory evidence is offered. Further,\nthe trier of fact may determine the credibility of the witness *840 and accept or reject his expert\nopinion testimony in whole or in part. However, appellant urges such authority was changed\nby the June 6, 1979, amendment to Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2226 (Vernon Supp.1981) which\nprovided:\n\n   “... The usual and customary fees in such cases shall be presumed to be reasonable, but such\n   presumption may be rebutted by competent evidence...” (Emphasis added).\n\nThe amendment further provides the act is to be liberally construed to promote its underlying\npurposes. In addition, it is remedial in nature and is intended to apply to all pending and future\nactions regardless of the time of institution or of the accrual of any cause of action asserted.\nThus, the 1979 amendment applies to the instant case. Appellant contends the presumption found\nin Article 2226, as amended, mandates and makes conclusive an award of attorney's fees in the\namount testified to by appellant's counsel in the absence of contradictory evidence.

Where the issue of attorney's fees is determined by the court, whether it is a jury\nor nonjury case, the court is authorized to take judicial notice of what the usual and customary\nfees are in such matters and of the contents of the case file without hearing further evidence. We\ndo not believe this means, or that it was intended, that, the court, having taken judicial notice\nof “usual and customary fees,” is mandated to award that specific amount in every instance.\nRather, we think the court is authorized to make an award up to that amount. Neither do we\nbelieve the statute mandates the award of a specific sum in a jury or nonjury case where there is\nunrebutted direct testimony of “the usual and customary fees,” or of unrebutted opinion testimony\nof “reasonable attorneys fees” whether or not they are the usual and customary fees. Under the\ncurrent provisions of Tex.R.Civ.P. 166-A, the court may render summary judgment on attorney's\nfees if the affidavit or other summary judgment evidence meets the clear, positive, direct and\nuncontradicted requirements of that rule. On the other hand, as stated above, we do not believe\nTex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2226 (Vernon Supp.1981) makes conclusive or mandatory in a trial\non the merits the award of a specific sum based on uncontradicted evidence of “the usual and\ncustomary fees.” This holding and interpretation will reconcile the range of possible attorney's fee\nawards in cases where there is uncontradicted evidence of “the usual and customary fees,” with the\ncases where there may be no evidence of “usual and customary fees” but there is uncontradicted\nopinion evidence of “reasonableness” of attorney's fees. Also, this view of the meaning and\napplication of Art. 2226 would apply equally to a default judgment situation where there is always\n *842 uncontradicted oral testimony or uncontradicted affidavit proof on attorney's fees. We do\nnot believe Art. 2226 was intended to render conclusive or mandate a specific award of attorney's\nfees in default judgment situations.\n\n [11] If the Legislature had intended uncontradicted opinion evidence on reasonableness of\nattorney's fees or uncontradicted evidence of “usual and customary” fees to be conclusive and\nmandate the award of a specific sum, it could easily have so stated. In the absence of such a clear\nstatement, we do not believe the Legislature so intended. The previous amendments all appear\nto relate to the question of supplying the element of “reasonableness” and of prima facie proof,\nand we believe this is also the thrust of the June 6, 1979, amendment.

Further, the attorney's opinion testimony of the amount\nwas not clear, direct and positive. The appellant's trial attorney opined that a reasonable fee for\nthese services would be “approximately $16,500.00.” The uncontradicted evidence did not indicate\nwhat “the usual and customary fees” were, but rather supplied the element of “reasonableness”\nand stated a reasonable fee would be approximately $16,500.00. Appellant's points of error four,\nfive and six are overruled.\n\n [12] [13] [14] [15] Appellant's seventh point of error contends the trial court erred in denying\n6% pre-judgment interest from January 1, 1976, under the provisions of Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann.\nart. 5069-1.03 (Vernon Supp.1981). That statute provides:\n\n            “When no specified rate of interest is agreed upon by the parties, interest at the\n            rate of six percent per annum shall be allowed on all accounts and contracts\n            ascertaining the sum payable, commencing on the thirtieth (30th) day from and\n            after the time when the sum is due and payable.”\n\nWhere pre-judgment interest is sought on the basis of a written contract fitting the description of\nArticle 5069-1.03 an award of this statutory interest, or interest eo nomine as it is known, may\nbe supported by a prayer for general relief.

Appellant did not have a specific pleading for pre-judgment interest in the instant\ncase, but he *843 had a general prayer for relief which is sufficient for the award of pre-judgment\ninterest under Art. 5069-1.03. The Republic National Bank of Dallas v. Northwest National Bank\nof Fort Worth, supra, at 116.\n\n [16] In the instant case, the suit was for recovery of damages based on the breach of a written\ncontract. The amount of appellant's damages cannot be ascertained on the basis of the liquidated\ndamage clause because it has been construed as a penalty provision. However, the contract in\nquestion ended August 31, 1977, and the actual damages were found by the jury and were\nascertained in the damage issue as a definite sum as of September 1, 1977, less the conversion\noffset admitted by appellant. We hold that appellant was entitled to recover 6% pre-judgment\ninterest under Article 5069-1.03 on the sum of $10,189.72 from October 1, 1977, pursuant to the\nthirty day provision of that statute to date of judgment on June 9, 1980.\n\n [17] Appellee asserts ten cross-points of error. In his first two cross-points, he argues the evidence\nconclusively showed as a matter of law that Butler Drilling Corporation did not assume or ratify\nthe contract, or that the jury finding to special issue number one was so against the great weight and\npreponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust. The contract in question indicates it was\nsigned and notarized on August 24, 1974, during which period of time negotiations were being had\nfor purchase of the assets of Butler Drilling Company. It was signed by Duncan Butler, President\nof Butler Drilling Company, who also was president of the successor corporation, Butler Drilling\nCorporation. There was evidence the contract in question was listed as an asset of Butler Drilling\nCompany when the assets were sold and the successor corporation Butler Drilling Corporation\nacquired them. The attorney for the purchaser discussed the contract with Mr. McClain, Vice-\nPresident of Butler Drilling Company, who also later became vice-president of the successor\ncorporation, and the attorney testified Mr. McClain told him the contract was oral. Butler Drilling\nCorporation abided by and operated under the contract for a year from October 1, 1974, to October\n24, 1975, when it terminated the contract. In addition, a letter from Mr. McClain was in evidence\nwhich referred to the written contract while he was acting as vice-president of Butler Drilling\nCorporation. Appellant contends that Duncan Butler actually signed the contract sometime after\nAugust 24, 1974, and that Butler Drilling Corporation thought the contract was an oral month to\nmonth arrangement rather than a written contract.

The special issue\nincluded both actual and apparent authority. The only Board of Directors for the company was Joe\nK. Butler, chairman of the Board; Duncan Butler, President; and Lee McClain, Vice-President.\nJoe K. Butler testified that he instructed Duncan Butler and Lee McClain to negotiate a contract\nwith appellant. The by-laws of the corporation provide the President has the power to employ and\ndischarge all employees and agents for the company. Both Butler Drilling Company and Butler\nDrilling Corporation operated and acted under the contract for more than a year, which provided\nfor maintenance of the company's radio equipment, an activity *844 in the every day operation\nof the company. This was the same activity which had been carried on by appellant for Butler\nDrilling Company on a month to month oral basis for nine to ten years prior to the date of the\nwritten contract. Appellee's cross-points three and four are overruled.\n\n [19] [20] [21] In its fifth and sixth cross-points, appellee says the evidence conclusively shows\nas a matter of law appellant is judicially estopped from claiming unlawful termination by reason of\ntestimony given in another lawsuit where he stated he quit, or that the answer by the jury to special\nissue number three that plaintiff was terminated is so against the great weight and preponderance\nof the evidence as to be manifestly unjust because of this prior testimony of plaintiff. While\nappellant appeared to make conflicting statements as to whether he quit or was terminated, he later\nexplained the discrepancy. He said he was confused and thought he was being asked about the\nother corporation, not Butler Drilling Corp., and equivocated on the earlier testimony that he quit.\nOne of the requirements for application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel is that the statement\nmust be deliberate, clear and unequivocal.

One of the items of conversion was a General\nElectric base station radio for which appellee had paid appellant but had never received.

Background\n\nMyrad and Fountainhead are residential real estate developers. Fountainhead is a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Myrad. Texcon is a construction contractor. On June 23, 1994, Myrad entered into\na written contract with Texcon for the construction of roadway, drainage, sewer, and waterline\nimprovements to the Cat Hollow subdivision in College Station, Texas (the Cat Hollow contract).\nOn October 6, 1994, Fountainhead entered into a written contract with Texcon for the construction\nof similar improvements to the Cypress Meadow subdivision and the Hidden Hollow subdivision,\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Consequently,\nTexcon filed three mechanic's and materialman's liens on Cat Hollow, Cypress Meadow, and\nHidden Hollow.\n\nSubsequently, Myrad and Fountainhead sued Texcon, each asserting a claim for breach of contract\nand seeking actual and liquidated damages for the untimely completion of the Cat Hollow and\nSpringbrook contracts. Furthermore, Myrad and Fountainhead each sought a declaratory judgment\nthat Texcon's liens were invalid and unenforceable because they were not filed timely. Myrad\nalso brought a claim for fraud, alleging Texcon falsely represented on April 19, 1995, that it was\naccepting payment in full and had no outstanding claims for work performed before such date.\n\nTexcon filed a counterclaim, alleging breach of contract for Myrad and Fountainhead's failure\nto pay for additional work performed pursuant to oral agreements. Texcon also brought a claim\nfor fraud, alleging several misrepresentations, including: (1) Myrad and Fountainhead wanted an\ninformal working relationship in which they could request that work be performed by Texcon on\nan as needed basis and Texcon would be compensated for such work; and (2) Texcon would not\nbe subject to any penalties as a result of any delays or interference caused by Myrad, Fountainhead\nor their other contractors. Texcon also sought (1) a declaratory judgment that its liens were valid,\nand (2) the foreclosure of its liens and the sale of the properties.\n\nAt trial, the jury found: (1) Texcon did not breach the Springbrook contract; (2) Texcon breached\nthe Cat Hollow contract and awarded Myrad $10,000.00 for the cost of obtaining a bond to secure\nTexcon's lien claims, but did not award any damages for lost profits or lost business opportunity;\n(3) Myrad or Fountainhead breached an oral or written agreement with Texcon and awarded\nTexcon $75,000.00; (4) Texcon did not commit fraud against Myrad or Fountainhead; (5) Myrad\nand Fountainhead did not commit fraud against Texcon; and (6) Myrad or Fountainhead acted with\nintent to harm, or with conscious indifference to the rights of Texcon, but did not award exemplary\ndamages. The jury awarded attorney's fees to Texcon in the amount of $83,000.00 for trial and\nadditional amounts for appeal to the court of appeals and the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n *2 The jury was further asked to determine the start and completion dates for Texcon's work under\nthe contracts. The jury found: (1) the beginning date for Cat Hollow was July 5, 1994, and the\ncompletion date was January 30, 1995; (2) the beginning date on Hidden Hollow was December\n21, 1994, and the completion date was April 14, 1995; and (3) the beginning date for Cypress\nMeadow was October 6, 1994, and the completion date was February 12, 1995.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Liquidated Damages\n\nIn its first point of error, Texcon claims the trial court erred in awarding liquidated damages to\nMyrad under the Cat Hollow contract. Texcon first argues the liquidated damages clause is an\nunenforceable penalty. A liquidated damages clause is the measure of recovery in the event of a\nbreach of the contract. See Newsom v.

Dan Bensimon, one of Myrad's owners,\ntestified that Myrad lost $52,000.00 from the inability to use and sell the Cat Hollow lots during\nTexcon's delayed performance. Another court of appeals has rejected a similar argument. See\nMurphy v. Cintas Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1640220\"><a href=\"/opinion/1640220/murphy-v-cintas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (Tex.App.-Tyler 1996, writ denied). In Murphy,\nthe court observed that even if actual damages could have been calculated at the time of trial,\nsuch testimony was long after the execution of the contract. See id.The uncertainty or difficulty\nin determining damages must have existed at the time the contract was executed. See id.;Oetting\nv. Flake Uniform & Linen Serv.

Similarly, Bensimon's testimony regarding Myrad's damages was two years after the parties\nentered into the Cat Hollow contract.\n\nMoreover, Texcon did not meet its burden in proving the liquidated damages clause was\nunenforceable because it failed to prove the amount of Myrad's actual damages. See Murphy, 923\nS.W.2d at 666; Johnson Eng'rs, Inc., 582 S.W.2d at 557; Robinson, 553 S.W.2d at 637. To satisfy\nits burden, Texcon would have had to offer evidence of Myrad's actual damages. Texcon failed\nto introduce such evidence. 1\n\n *4 Texcon also asserts there is no reasonable relation between the jury's award of $0 for lost\nprofits and lost business opportunities and the trial court's award of $29,500.00 for liquidated\ndamages. The jury found Texcon breached the Cat Hollow contract, but awarded no damages for\nlost profits and lost business opportunities. The contract provided Texcon had 150 days in which\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               4\n\fCDS Enterprises, Inc. v.

The jury found Texcon began construction under the Cat Hollow contract\non July 5, 1994, and completed performance on January 30, 1995, which was 59 days late. Myrad\nmoved for judgment N.O.V. on its' liquidated damages. The trial court granted Myrad's motion\nand entered a finding of fact that Texcon completed its work 59 days late. The trial court further\nentered conclusions of law that Myrad's damages were uncertain and difficult or impossible to\ncalculate, and that $500.00 per day liquidated damages was reasonable. Therefore, we find the\ntrial court's award of liquidated damages in the amount of $29,500.00 is proper.\n\nNext, Texcon argues Myrad waived the liquidated damages clause by releasing the retainage. See\nAnderson Dev. Corp. v. Coastal States Crude Gathering Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2430766\"><a href=\"/opinion/2430766/anderson-dev-corp-v-coastal-states-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405 (Tex.Civ.App.-\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.).

When she received the “Invoice for Balance Due” from Texcon in April 1995, she called\nO.E. “Buster” Smith, president of Texcon, to determine if it was, in fact, the last invoice because\nit showed retainage was due. After speaking to Smith, she recommended paying the retainage,\nbut not all the items on the invoice. If this had not been the last invoice, Keating would not have\nrecommended paying the retainage.\n\nAfter paying the retainage, Myrad received several invoices on April 28, 1995, in the amount\nof $59,000 for work performed months earlier, which Texcon asserts was extra-contractual done\npursuant to oral agreements.

The question submitted to the jury asked:\n\n            Did Texcon breach the Cat Hollow contract and proximately cause damage to\n            Myrad or Fountainhead?\n\nSeveral instructions on excuse were submitted to the jury:\n\n   Failure to comply by a party is excused if compliance is waived by the other party.\n\n   A waiver is an intentional surrender of a known right or intentional conduct inconsistent with\n   claiming the right.\n\n   Failure to comply by a party is excused if all the following circumstances occurred:\n\n   1. the acting party:\n\n      a. By words or conduct made a false representation or concealed material facts,\n\n      b.

Relied to its detriment on the false representation or concealment of material facts.\n\n   Failure to comply, if any, by a party is excused by the other party's previous failure, if any, to\n   comply with a material obligation of the same agreement.\n\nHere, because the burden of proof was properly placed, Texcon did not waive this defense. In any\nevent, we find that Texcon's challenge to the sufficiency of evidence that its delayed performance\nwas not excused must fail.\n\nAs previously noted, the contract provided Texcon had 150 days to complete its work. The jury\nfound Texcon began construction under the Cat Hollow contract on July 5, 1994, and completed\nperformance on January 30, 1995, when Texcon signed the completion certificate, or 209 days.

Myrad contracted with Texcon for the subgrade, base, and asphalt,\nbut not the curbs and gutters. South Construction was to provide that work. In subgrading, the\nentire road bed is graded, and then lime is laid down to stabilize the surface. The curb and gutter\nwork cannot begin until the lime stabilization is complete.\n\n *7 On October 3, 1994, Texcon submitted a construction schedule to Myrad, under which\nTexcon would complete the subgrade by October 17, 1994. Texcon allowed eleven to sixteen\ndays for South Construction to put in approximately 5000 linear feet of curbs and gutters. Texcon\nclaims South Construction was to begin work on the curbs and gutters on October 17, 1994,\ncompleting such work by November 1, 1994. Myrad does not dispute that it should have taken\nSouth Construction eleven to sixteen days to complete its work. Myrad asserts Texcon completed\nthe subgrade late. Therefore, South Construction started the curb and gutter work late. Myrad also\nmaintains that South Construction timely completed its work once it was able to start work.\n\nAt trial and at deposition, Smith gave conflicting testimony regarding when Texcon had completed\nthe subgrade. At trial, Smith testified that Texcon completed the subgrade on October 25, 1994. In\nhis deposition testimony, which was read at trial, Smith stated that Texcon completed the subgrade\non November 5, 1994. Therefore, South Construction, by either date, could not have started its\nwork on October 17, 1994.\n\nBensimon testified, based on concrete delivery tickets, the curb and gutter work started on\nNovember 7 or 8, 1994. This is consistent with Smith's testimony that Texcon completed the\nsubgrade on November 5. Myrad further presented evidence that Texcon was laying the base in\nDecember. David Dobbs, the city inspector, testified that his log entry for December 9, 1994,\nshows that Texcon was laying the base on two of the four streets in Cat Hollow, which indicated to\nhim that South Construction had finished the curbs and gutters on those two streets. Furthermore,\nDobbs testified that his log entry for December 13 1994, states that Texcon was “laying base\nthroughout entire job.”\n\nThe final stage of street construction, which is laying the base, involves hauling in the rock which\nmakes the base, spreading it, blading it with a grader, watering it, compacting it, and finally having\nit tested for compaction. Dobbs testified that his log entries for the compaction testing showed that\ntesting was occurring on all four streets on December 21, 1994, but he did not have any test dates\nafter that. Therefore, according to Myrad, the base was completed as of December 21, 1994.\n\nTexcon disputes Myrad's claim that it had completed the base as of December 21, 1994. With\nrespect to compaction testing, Dobbs further stated he felt sure there was other testing after\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The\ncompaction testing results were not entered into evidence.\n\nTexcon further points to testimony that the quality of South Constructions's work was poor and\nhad to be redone through out the subdivision. Dobbs testified that he believed this curb and gutter\nproject was the first such project for Larry Schultz of South Construction. Smith testified that\nSouth Construction tried to use a machine to pour the concrete, but its crew did not know how\nto use the machine and spent considerable time practicing with it. Moreover, Dobbs testified he\nfound the curb and gutter work to be of poor quality and not acceptable to the standards for the\nCity of College Station. Dobbs stated that those unacceptable sections of curb and gutter had to\nbe taken out and redone, taking additional time.\n\n *8 Dobbs' log entry for December 13, 1994, shows, in addition to “Texcon-laying base through\nout entire job,” that South Construction needed to remove and replace two sections of the curb.\nDobbs' log entry for January 3, 1995, states “Mike South-told him to tear out curb in culdesac [sic]\non Lynx and put it back to grade!”Dobbs's log book contains several entries showing that Texcon\nwas doing backfilling work on the curbs in late December 1994, and backfilling the sidewalks\nthrough most of January 1995.\n\nThe jury, as the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their\ntestimony, was entitled to discount the testimony of any witness.

In the\nalternative, Texcon argues there is no evidence or insufficient evidence for an award greater than\n$5,000.00.\n\n *9 Bensimon testified that to convey clear title to the Cat Hollow lots, Myrad had to obtain\na “nonstatutory bond.” To this end, Myrad executed an “Indemnity Agreement with Letter of\nCredit to Protect Against Defects in Title,” under which Myrad indemnified University Title\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Accordingly, the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support a finding\nthat Myrad had obtained a “bond.”\n\nIn the alternative, Texcon contends there is no evidence or factually insufficient evidence that\nMyrad expended more than $5,000.00 to obtain the letter of credit. Bensimon testified that the total\nexpense of the letter of credit was $5,000.00, “not including having to put up cash collateral for\nthe letter of credit.”A review of the record reflects no evidence of the amount of damages Myrad\nsustained from the of loss of the use of the cash it had put up as collateral for the letter of credit.\nTherefore, we find the evidence legally insufficient to support the jury's award of $10,000.00 for\nthe cost of obtaining a bond. Texcon's fourth point of error is sustained and the award for obtaining\na bond is reduced to $5,000.00.\n\n\n\n                                          III. Springbrook Contract\n\n *10 In its fifth point of error, Texcon asserts the trial court erred in awarding liquidated damages\nto Fountainhead under the Springbrook contract. At trial, Fountainhead claimed Texcon breached\nthe Springbrook contract by failing to complete timely all improvements to Hidden Hollow. 4 The\njury found that Texcon did not breach the Springbrook contract and, consequently, awarded no\ndamages. In a summary judgment hearing prior to trial, the court found that Texcon commenced\nwork on the Springbrook contract, which included Cypress Meadow and Hidden Hollow, on\nOctober 6, 1994, and completed work on April 14, 1995. In a separate question regarding Texcon's\nbeginning and completion dates, the jury found Texcon began construction on Hidden Hollow on\nDecember 21, 1994, and completed construction on April 14, 1995, 114 days later.\n\nFountainhead filed a motion for partial judgment notwithstanding the verdict, asking that the\ntrial court enter judgment against Texcon for breach of the Springbrook contract and to enforce\nthe liquidated damages provision for 130 days in accordance with the court's previous summary\njudgment finding.

SeeTEX.R.CIV.P. 301. A JNOV may be upheld only if there is no\nevidence to support the jury's findings. See Mancorp., Inc. v.

See Culpepper, 802 S.W.2d at 228; Navarette,\n706 S.W.2d at 310.\n\nSmith, and Texcon's project manager Gary Arnold, testified that once Texcon started work on\nHidden Hollow, Fountainhead sent Texcon's crews to work on Cypress Meadow. Dobbs testified\nthat he witnessed Texcon workmen being pulled from the Hidden Hollow worksite. Considering\nonly the evidence supporting the jury's finding of no breach, and rejecting all evidence to the\ncontrary, we find there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury's finding that Texcon\ndid not breach the Springbrook contract on the basis that any delay by Texcon was caused by\nFountainhead. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting Fountainhead's motion for JNOV and\nawarding Fountainhead liquidated damages on its own finding of breach. Accordingly, Texcon's\nfifth point of error is sustained.\n\n\n\n                                            IV.

Validity of the Liens\n\nIn its eighth point of error, Texcon complains the trial court erred in declaring its liens invalid and\nunenforceable. The jury awarded Texcon $75,000.00 on its breach of contract claim. The jury,\nhowever, did not determine the amount of any indebtedness for each tract. In its conclusions of\nlaw filed post-judgment, the trial court stated the liens “are not capable of enforcement and must\nbe invalidated because any indebtedness for work performed on any specific, separate tract of land\nfor which a lien was claimed was not established and Texcon thus waived its right to enforcement\nby foreclosure of a lien, if any.”Texcon argues the trial court could have apportioned the damages\namong the three liens and credited each lien with a pro-rata reduction. 8\n\nTo be entitled to foreclose on a mechanic's and materialman's lien, the claimant must prove the\nproperty on which he wants to foreclose is the improvement itself or the parcel of land connected\nwith the improvements.

Although the jury in Morris found damages for\neach indebtedness as to each plaintiff, the trial court entered judgment in a single amount to the\nplaintiffs. See id.The court of appeals found the trial court erred in failing to segregate the damages.\nThe trial court's judgment should establish the indebtedness accrued for which the defendant was\nliable as to each plaintiff, as applied to each parcel of land foreclosed and ordered sold, with the\ndecree framed so that each parcel is directed to be sold separately so that from time of judgment,\nthe amount necessary to redeem the lien on each parcel is known.

The appellant must show the judgment turns\non the particular excluded or admitted evidence. See Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d at 753-54.\n\n *14 Texcon proffered its expert witness, A.P. Boyd, who was designated for matters relating\nto construction methods, to testify about prior dealings he had had with Myrad on a different\nsubdivision construction project. Myrad and Fountainhead objected on the basis that Texcon was\ntrying to show conformity with a prior act. SeeTEX.R.EVID. 404(b). 9 The trial court sustained the\nobjection. Texcon contends such evidence is admissible to establish intent for fraud and exemplary\ndamages.\n\nIn the bill of exception, Boyd testified the city inspector had told him it was too wet to shoot the\nbase. Bensimon, however, ordered Boyd to prime the streets and told him he would “accept the\nresponsibility” for it. After priming the streets, it rained, washing the prime into a creek. The city\nordered Boyd's company to clean up the oil spoil. After signing a full lien release, Boyd invoiced\nMyrad $800 for the cleanup.\n\nWe find that Boyd's testimony was intended to show that Myrad was acting in conformity with\nprior conduct. Therefore, it was not relevant to the issue of intent in Texcon's claims for fraud\nand exemplary damages. The trial court did not err in excluding Boyd's testimony. Texcon's tenth\npoint of error is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                              VII. Attorney's Fees\n\nIn its sixth point of error, Texcon claims the trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees to Myrad\nand Fountainhead. First, Texcon argues Myrad and Fountainhead are not entitled to attorney's fees\nbecause they should not have prevailed on their claims. As already determined, Myrad prevailed\non its claim for breach of the Cat Hollow contract and Myrad and Fountainhead both prevailed\non their claims for declaratory judgment that Texcon's liens are invalid and unenforceable.\nSeeTEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 38.001(8) (Vernon 1997) (providing attorney's fees\nto party prevailing on breach of contract claim); TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 37.009\n(Vernon 1997) (providing for attorney's fees in declaratory judgment proceeding).\n\nSecond, Texcon asserts the trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees based on the testimony\nof Myrad and Fountainhead's expert, Cully Lipsey. Lipsey, Myrad and Fountainhead's original\nattorney on this case, testified that a reasonable hourly rate is $150.00 to $200.00.

In their response to Texcon's\ninterrogatories, Myrad and Fountainhead stated Lipsey would “testify regarding reasonableness\nof liquidated damages and attorneys [sic] fees.”Texcon argues Lipsey's testimony should have\nbeen excluded under Rule 215(5) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides for the\nautomatic exclusion of evidence for failure to respond to or supplement a response to a request\nfor discovery in the absence of good cause.

Texcon\ncontends that if Lipsey's testimony had been excluded, there would have been no basis on which\nthe trial court could take judicial notice of Myrad and Fountainhead's attorney's fees.\n\nWhen the issue of attorney's fees is left to the trial court rather than the jury, the court may\ndetermine a reasonable fee for legal services based upon its knowledge of usual and customary\nrates and its review of the file, even if no other evidence is offered.

Moreover, even though there\nis no indication of whether the trial court took judicial notice of its file, we shall presume it did.\nWe cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in its awarding attorney's fees to Myrad and\nFountainhead.\n\n *16 Texcon also argues Myrad and Fountainhead had a duty to segregate its attorney's fees by\nclaims.

See id. at\n11. 10 Texcon's sixth point of error is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                             Prejudgment Interest\n\nIn its eleventh point of error, Texcon contends the trial court erred in calculating prejudgment\ninterest. The court awarded prejudgment interest at a rate of six percent. The court, however,\nentered amounts for prejudgment interest equal to the damage award plus interest. This appears\nto be a clerical error. When the trial court errs in calculating the judgment, this court has the\nauthority to reform the judgment. See GXG, Inc. v.

At no\ntime did they request the trial court to enter judgment on the jury's verdict that they had breached\nany oral or written contract with Texcon. We do not find that Myrad and Fountainhead waived\ntheir right to challenge that portion of the judgment entered in favor of Texcon.\n\nIn their first cross-point, Myrad and Fountainhead claim the trial court erred in submitting\nQuestions Nos. 5 and 6 regarding breach of an oral contract because (1) they were multifarious\nand (2) there was no evidence of any oral contract. 11 Myrad and Fountainhead first argue Question\nNo. 5 was multifarious. A review of the record establishes that Myrad and Fountainhead failed to\nobject to the submission of this question on that basis. Therefore, Myrad and Fountainhead have\nfailed to preserve error on this complaint. SeeTEX.R.APP.P. 33.1.\n\nNext, Myrad and Fountainhead do not dispute that they made verbal requests of Texcon for extra\nwork not included in the written contracts and that Texcon was paid for any work done pursuant\nto verbal requests. 12 Instead, they assert there is no evidence that they orally requested Texcon to\ndo the work covered by the invoices upon which Texcon sues or that they agreed to pay Texcon\nfor such work. Texcon maintains that the evidence establishes several implied contracts.\n\n *18 To be legally binding, a contract must be sufficiently definite in its terms so that a court can\nunderstand what the promisor undertook.

Smith\ntestified that he told Bensimon that he was concerned about another contractor doing the curb\nand gutter work and how that would affect or delay Texcon's performance of the Cat Hollow\ncontract. Smith further testified that Bensimon promised there would be no delay and if there were\na problem, Myrad would take care of it.\n\nTexcon claims there is evidence sufficient to support the existence of several oral agreements,\nwhich are implied in fact. With regard to the Cat Hollow contract, Smith and Arnold testified that\nTexcon was ultimately responsible for constructing reinforced concrete sidewalks and recessed\nstorm sewer inlets, even though these structures were deleted from the Cat Hollow contract\nand other contractors had started working on them. Texcon performed this work pursuant to\noral agreements with Myrad. Smith further testified that the late invoices for labor and services\nfurnished at Cat Hollow included idle time and the inexperience of the curb and gutter contractor\nresulting in Texcon's having to be on the job to assure drainage and protection for the subgrade,\nwas work performed pursuant to verbal agreements, and that Texas was not paid.\n\nWith regard to Cypress Meadow, Smith testified that work for relocating and lowering a gas\nline, which was installed on Fountainhead's property, and for relocating water and sewer service\nmarkers, which were destroyed by the street contractor, was performed in accordance with oral\nagreements and the invoices for this work were not paid. Smith also testified that Texcon has\nnot been paid for work done in repairing utility ditch lines, which was done pursuant to a verbal\nagreement.\n\n *19 Moreover, in support of its claim that the oral contracts were implied in fact, Texcon relies\non Buxani v.

We find there is more than a scintilla of evidence to\nsupport the existence of oral contracts for additional work. Myrad and Fountainhead's first cross-\npoint is overruled.\n\nIn their second cross-point, Myrad and Fountainhead challenge the legal and factual sufficiency of\nthe evidence to support the jury's verdict that they had breached any oral or written contract with\nTexcon. We shall consider the evidence discussed in the previous cross-point. Additionally, in our\nfactual sufficiency review, we shall consider evidence contrary to the jury's finding that there was\na breach. See Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176.\n\nMyrad and Fountainhead argue that any unpaid invoices contain charges for delay time or remedial\nwork not compensable under the terms of the written contracts. Also, pursuant to the written\ncontracts, Texcon was to bill on a monthly basis for the work performed during the prior month,\nregardless of whether such work was done under the written contract or for extra work. Smith\ntestified that he followed this procedure.\n\nOn the Cat Hollow contract, Smith testified that he did not submit the invoices to Myrad for work\ndone under any oral agreements until after he had accepted the retainage because he “had mixed\nemotions about what to do with them. And then there were circumstances that arose afterwards that\nhelped [him] make up [his] mind.”Myrad contends delay and idle time are specifically prohibited\nunder the Cat Hollow contract. Bensimon testified that he did not agree to pay Texcon for any\nidle time.\n\n *20 Texcon submitted invoices for work it claims was performed under the written Cat Hollow\ncontract related to trench safety, laying pipe, and excavation, which was done in July and August\n1994. Myrad refused payment of these invoices when they were originally submitted. Texcon\nagain submitted these invoice in April 1995, with its request for retainage. Debbie Keating, the\nproject engineer, rejected these invoices for payment. Bensimon stated that these invoices were\nnot paid because Myrad disagreed with the requested amounts.\n\nWith respect to the invoice for repairing ditch lines in Cypress Meadow, Texcon prepared\nthis invoice on April 28, 1995, even though this work apparently started in January. Texcon\ncompleted Cypress Meadow on April 14, 1995. Fountainhead asserts that there is no evidence\nthat Fountainhead agreed to pay for this work. Mike McClure, the project engineer, testified that\nthis was remedial work for which Texcon was responsible without further compensation under the\nwritten contract. Smith testified that the written contract does not provide for extra compensation\nfor repairing ditch lines.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

With respect\nto Hidden Hollow, Texcon introduced five invoices totaling $30,092.50 for work under the\nwritten contract. There is no dispute that Texcon was not paid the balance for these invoices,\nbut Fountainhead asserts Texcon failed to complete timely Hidden Hollow and was entitled to\nliquidated damages. The jury, however, did not find that Texcon had breached the Springbrook\ncontract and we have found the trial court erred in granting Fountainhead's motion for JNOV.\n\nWe cannot say the jury's finding that Myrad or Fountainhead breached any oral or written contract\nis so against the great and weight and preponderance of evidence as to be manifestly unjust or\nwrong. See Pool, 715 S.W.2d at 635. The jury, as the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses\nand the weight to be given to their testimony, was entitled to discount the testimony of any witness.\nSee Skrepnek, 889 S.W.2d at 579. Myrad and Fountainhead's second cross-point is overruled.\n\nIn their third cross-point, Myrad and Fountainhead argue that even if there is evidence of their\nbreach of any contract with Texcon, there is no evidence or factually insufficient evidence of\ndamages in the amount of $75,000.00; therefore, the trial court erred in entering judgment against\nthem for $75,000.00.\n\n *21 The total amount of allegedly unpaid invoices which Texcon sought in the three liens was\n$121,120.36. Under the written Cat Hollow contract, Texcon claims $8,341.00 in unpaid work\nand $59,001.75 under its oral agreements with Myrad. Texcon submitted an invoice for $30,510\nfor unpaid retainage on Cypress Meadow and $25,380.50 for unpaid work done pursuant to oral\nagreements. The original amount of the lien on Cypress Meadow was $55,890.50, but Texcon\nfiled a partial release for $32,205.39, leaving a net lien of $23,685.11. On Hidden Hollow, Texcon\nsubmitted five invoices for unpaid work performed under the written contract totaling $30,092.50,\nthe amount of the Hidden Hollow lien. Smith testified to loss of interest income of $27,500.00 and\nloss for interest on loans of $72,689.00.\n\nConsidering the amount of damages sought by Texcon and the amount which the jury ultimately\nawarded, it is clear that the jury did not find that Texcon was entitled to recovery on every claim.\nIt is clear, however, that the $75,000.00 award is supported by the evidence.

Myrad and Fountainhead's\nthird cross-point is overruled.\n\nIn its fourth cross-point, Myrad and Fountainhead contend the trial court erred in entering judgment\nagainst it because jury's findings were not sufficient to support the judgment. Because of the\ndisjunctive form of the questions, it cannot be ascertained from the jury's finding whether it was\nMyrad or Fountainhead that was in breach of contract. Moreover, the judgment does not specify\nwhether Texcon is to recover from Myrad, Fountainhead, or both.\n\nThey argue the trial court did not have the proper specific findings upon which to enter a\nsufficiently definite and certain judgment. A judgment must be sufficiently definite and certain to\ndefine and protect the rights of all litigants, or it should provide a definite means of ascertaining\nsuch rights, to the end that ministerial officers can carry the judgment into execution without\nascertainment of facts not therein stated.

Having waived this complaint for appellate\nreview, Myrad and Fountainhead's fourth cross-point is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                                 IX. Conclusion\n\n *22 We affirm the judgment with respect to liquidated damages for Texcon's breach of the\nCat Hollow contract, Myrad and Fountainhead's attorney's fees, and damages for Myrad and\nFountainhead's breach of oral contract. The judgment awarding Myrad $10,000.00 for the cost of\nobtaining a bond is modified to $5,000.00 and the prejudgment interest on the $29,500.00 award\nfor liquidated damages is modified to reflect the actual amount of prejudgment interest rather the\naward for liquidated damages combined with prejudgment interest. As modified, the judgment\nis affirmed. Finally, that portion of the judgment awarding Fountainhead liquidated damages for\nbreach of the Springbrook contract is reversed and it is rendered that Fountainhead take nothing\non its claim that Texcon breached the Springbrook contract.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texcon maintains that had\n       210 days to complete all work under the Springbrook contract, including Hidden Hollow, and therefore, it completed its work in a\n       timely manner. For the disposition of this point of error, we need not determine this provision of the Springbrook contract.\n5      We find this argument dispositive of the other arguments contained in this point of error. Texcon also argues (1) the liquidated damages\n       clause is an unenforceable penalty, and (2) the contract provided Texcon with 210 days to substantially complete the Springbrook\n       contract, which included both Cypress Meadow and Hidden Hollow and, therefore, there was no breach because Hidden Hollow\n       was completed timely.\n6      Fountainhead asserts that Texcon does not challenge the trial court's granting of the JNOV, but only challenges the enforcement of\n       the liquidated damages clause on the basis of the jury's finding of no breach. To the contrary, we find Texcon's challenge to the trial\n       court's award of liquidated damages to Fountainhead a challenge to the JNOV.\n7      Myrad and Fountainhead filed a special exception to Texcon's first amended counterclaim on May 2, 1996. Attempting to address\n       the special exception, Texcon filed a second amended counterclaim on May 6, 1996. At a hearing on May 10, 1996, Myrad and\n       Fountainhead asked the trial court to consider their special exception to the first amended counterclaim. The court, however, ordered\n       them to refile their special exception. They did not refile their special exception, but instead, on the first day of trial, asked the\n       trial court to rule on the previously tendered special exception. Texcon reminded the court of what had transpired at the previous\n       hearing and argued that they should have amended their special exception to address the second amended counterclaim. Myrad and\n       Fountainhead acknowledged that Texcon had repleaded in response to their special exception, but argued Texcon still had not alleged\n       facts to support a claim for constructive fraud.\n8      Texcon filed three liens: (1) on Cat Hollow for $67,342.75, (2) on Cypress Meadow for $55,890.50, and (3) on Hidden Hollow for\n       $30,092.50.

In February 2002, Montebello\nand the Chans entered into a Purchase Contract (the “Contract”) for the sale and purchase of a\ncondominium unit on the twenty-third floor of the building for a total purchase price of $920,000.\nAs provided in the Contract, the Chans deposited earnest money, defined in the purchase contract\nas the “Initial Payment,” of $92,000 with Stewart Title. The Chans had negotiated the Initial\nPayment down from twenty percent to ten percent of the total purchase price. Ultimately, however,\nthe Chans failed to close on the unit, and Stewart Title delivered the Initial Payment to Montebello.\n\nIn November 2005, the Chans sued Montebello and Stewart Title to recover the Initial Payment,\nasserting claims of unjust enrichment, breach of contract, and tortious interference with contract\nagainst Montebello. The Chans alleged conversion and negligence against both Montebello\nand Stewart Title, and as to Stewart Title only, the Chans alleged promissory estoppel, fraud,\nnegligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty. The Chans sought actual and punitive\ndamages, and attorney's fees. 1 Montebello and Stewart Title answered, and Montebello also filed a\ncounterclaim asserting breach of contract and requesting a declaratory judgment that it was entitled\nto the Initial Payment as liquidated damages under the Contract. Montebello requested attorney's\nfees as provided in the Contract and under the Declaratory Judgments Act. SeeTEX. CIV.\nPRAC. & REM.CODE § 37.009. The Chans answered and alleged as affirmative defenses fraud,\nmisrepresentation, waiver, mistake, failure to mitigate, non-occurrence of conditions precedent,\nand denial of pre-judgment interest.\n\n *2 Montebello and Stewart Title moved for summary judgment against all of the Chans' claims\nand sought a declaration that, as a matter of law, the Contract was terminated and Montebello was\nentitled to the Initial Payment as liquidated damages.

Appellees also asserted that Stewart Title properly delivered the Initial Payment to\nMontebello in accordance with the Contract. The Chans responded and objected to Montebello and\nStewart Title's summary judgment proof, 2 but they did not deny that they failed to comply with\ntheir obligations under the Contract to purchase the unit. Instead, they asserted that, after entering\ninto the Contract, they encountered financial difficulties and requested a refund of the Initial\nPayment, and they also offered to reimburse Montebello for an “agreed amount of reasonable\nactual damages.”However, Montebello refused to refund any amount of the Initial Payment. The\nChans further asserted that the contractual provision permitting Montebello to retain the Initial\nPayment in the event of the purchaser's default was unreasonable and an unenforceable penalty.\n\nAfter the parties submitted additional briefing, the trial court entered a judgment in favor of\nMontebello and Stewart Title. In the judgment, dated September 27, 2006, the trial court declared\nthat the Contract was terminated and Montebello was entitled to keep the Initial Payment as\nliquidated damages under the Contract, and awarded attorney's fees of $20,000 to Montebello and\nadditional attorney's fees of $7,500 if an appeal is filed in the court of appeals and $7,500 if a\npetition for review is filed in the Texas Supreme Court. The trial court included in the judgment\nlanguage demonstrating that it expressly intended to dispose of all parties and claims and that the\njudgment was final. 3 This appeal followed.\n\n\nAnalysis of the Chans' Issues\n\nI. Is the Liquidated Damages Provision an Unenforceable Penalty?\nIn their first two issues, the Chans contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\non Montebello's claim for declaratory judgment and awarding it the $92,000 Initial Payment as\nliquidated damages under the Contract, because the amount is excessive and constitutes an illegal\npenalty. 4 We disagree.\n\n\nB.

For example,\nin Zucht, the court explained: “It has been held, time and again, that a provision for liquidated\ndamages in a contract for the sale and purchase of real estate is proper as being a transaction in\nwhich the damages for the breach thereof are uncertain and not easily estimated with accuracy.”\nZucht, 207 S.W.2d at 419 (collecting cases). Texas courts have recognized that often “[i]t is\nimpossible to forecast the damages which might flow to the seller of real property in the event of\nbreach of the contract by the purchasers,” because “[r]eal property has a fluctuating value” and\n“[t]here is no way to ascertain at any given time what the value of a particular tract of real property\nmight be in the future.” Naylor, 613 S.W.2d at 547.\n\n\nC. The Liquidated Damages Provision is Not an Unenforceable Penalty\n*4 In support of their contention that the Contract's liquidated damages provision is an\nunenforceable penalty, the Chans stress the following language from Phillips:\n\n           The right of competent parties to make their own bargains is not unlimited.\n           The universal rule for measuring damages for the breach of a contract is just\n           compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained. By the operation of that\n           rule a party generally should be awarded neither less nor more than his actual\n           damages. A party has no right to have a court enforce a stipulation which violates\n           the principle underlying that rule.\n\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. Consequently, the Chans argue the trial court erred because it “never\ninquired into the evidence of actual injuries to attempt to do justice between the parties,” and\nas a result, Montebello received a windfall. See id.(noting that, although the question whether a\ncontractual provision is enforceable is a question of law, sometimes factual issues must be resolved\nbefore the legal question can be decided).\n\nThe Chans, relying on a 2006 property tax record from the Harris County Appraisal District,\nassert that information concerning Montebello's actual damages was readily available. However,\nevidence that a property sold at a later date for the same price, or even at a profit, is no evidence that\na provision is an unreasonable stipulation as to contemplated damages. Zucht, 207 S.W.2d at 419;\nThanksgiving Tower Partners, 64 F.3d at 232-33;see also Baker, 812 S.W.2d at 55 (“Evidence\nrelated to the difficulty of estimation and the reasonable forecast must be viewed as of the\ntime the contract was executed.”). The Chans also speculate that Montebello must possess other\ninformation that would show actual damages, such as “financial information with respect to the\nconstruction and occupancy of the property” and “marketing allowances for each Unit.” However,\nthey submitted no evidence of any such information in response to the motion for summary\njudgment. 5 The Chans further speculate as to the type of actual damages that would be incurred\nby Montebello, such as “remarketing expenses” and “depreciation expense,” and conclude that the\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

First, in Phillips, the\nTexas Supreme Court considered a contractual provision in which one party agreed to pay the\nother party as liquidated damages ten times the actual damages. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 787,\n789. The Court determined that such a provision involved no fact issues, as it could not meet either\npart of the test for an enforceable liquidated damages provision. Id. at 789.The Chans also cite\nFlores v. Millennium Interests, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894686\"><a href=\"/opinion/894686/flores-v-millennium-interests-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 431 (Tex.2005), to support their contention\nthat the trial court erred because the amount of liquidated damages, $92,000, was excessive. In\nthat case, the Court was asked, on certified questions from the Fifth Circuit, to construe certain\nstatutes applying to contracts for deed. Id. at 428.The Court noted that, while an amount stipulated\nin advance as an acceptable measure of damages may be either an enforceable liquidated damages\nprovision or an unenforceable penalty under the common law, the same “does not always hold true\nfor statutes.”Id. at 431.Consequently, the Court determined that a statutory “liquidated damages”\nprovision for noncompliance, when invoked, was penal in nature. Id. at 433.Here, in contrast, the\ncontractual provision at issue is in no way comparable to the provision at issue in Phillips or the\nstatutes considered in Flores, and so neither case supports the Chans' claim.\n\n *5 The Chans also complain that Montebello has offered no legal authority or extrinsic evidence\nto support its assertion that damages would be impossible to ascertain or that the liquidated\ndamages amount was a reasonable estimate of actual damages. However, as the party asserting\nthe affirmative defense of penalty, the burden was on the Chans, not Montebello, to demonstrate\nthat the Contract's liquidated damages provision was an unenforceable penalty. See, e.g., Fluid\nConcepts, Inc., 159 S.W.3d at 231; Johnson Eng'rs, Inc., 582 S.W.2d at 557; Tri-Cities Constr.,\nInc., 523 S.W.2d at 428.\n\nThe Chans, as the party with the burden to prove their affirmative defense of penalty, cite no\nauthorities to contradict the longstanding recognition that damages for the breach of a contract\nto buy or sell real estate are uncertain and not easily estimated. See, e.g., Thanksgiving Tower\nPartners, 64 F.3d at 232; Zucht, 207 S.W.2d at 419; Naylor, 613 S.W.2d at 547. Further, the Chans\nagreed to the liquidated damages provision, which clearly provides that, in the event of the Chans'\ndefault, the Initial Payment shall be delivered to Montebello “as liquidated damages and not as a\npenalty” because of “the uncertainty and difficulty of ascertaining and measuring” Montebello's\nactual damages. The provision plainly reflects the intent of the parties to provide for liquidated\ndamages in the amount of the Initial Payment. See Elliott, 223 S.W.2d at 295 (holding that terms of\nagreement to purchase beach-front property plainly expressed the parties' intention that the earnest\nmoney constituted liquidated damages and stating that “[h]ere the amount of the damages that\nwould be sustained by the seller by a breach was uncertain in the same sense that the amount of\nthe damages for a breach of a contract for the sale of real estate is generally uncertain.”).\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Consequently, given the information before\nit, there was no need for the trial court to resolve additional factual issues before rendering its\ndecision.\n\n*6 Therefore, we agree with the trial court's conclusion that, as a matter of law, the Contract's\nprovision was an enforceable liquidated damages provision rather than an unenforceable penalty.\nWe overrule the Chans' first two issues.\n\n\nII. Is the Contract Void for Lack of Mutuality of Obligation?\nIn their third issue, the Chans contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\nbecause the Contract is void for lack of mutuality of obligation. According to the Chans, under\nthe Contract, Montebello was under no obligation to actually provide a unit to them because the\nContract specifically states that Montebello would not “warranty the completion of the Unit on\nany given date.”Again, we disagree.\n\n\nA.

A contract that lacks consideration lacks mutuality of obligation and\nis unenforceable. See Tex. Gas Utils. Co., 460 S.W.2d at 412.\n\n\nC. The Contract is Not Void For Lack of Mutuality of Obligation\nWe do not construe the language of the provision to reflect a lack of mutuality of obligation\nas the Chans contend. The provision the Chans rely on is included in a section concerning the\nconstruction schedule for the Montebello condominium, which was not completed at the time\nthe Contract was executed. This provision is intended to recognize the myriad of factors that can\naffect the construction process and to provide flexibility to Montebello rather than to obligate it to\ncomplete the construction on a specific date or risk breaching the contract. It does not mean that\nMontebello has no obligation to perform at all. Montebello agreed to sell a specific condominium\nunit and the Chans agreed to purchase the unit. As a result, Montebello removed the unit from\nthe market and was thereafter precluded from entertaining other offers for it. Montebello also was\nrequired to sell the unit to the Chans at the specified sales price, which the Chans agreed to pay.\nTherefore, we conclude that the Contract is not void for lack of mutuality. We overrule the Chans'\nthird issue.\n\n\nIII. Did the Trial Court Err in Granting Summary Judgment in Favor of Montebello on\nAll of the Chans' Claims for Affirmative Relief?\nIn their fourth issue, the Chans contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in\nfavor of Montebello on all of their claims for affirmative relief. Specifically, the Chans assert that\nMontebello did not demonstrate it was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law because\nthere are fact issues regarding their affirmative claims of unjust enrichment, breach of contract,\nconversion, negligence, and intentional interference with contract, which the Chans pleaded in\ntheir petition.\n\n *8 To prevail on a traditional motion for summary judgment, the movant must show that there is\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that it entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The only dispute between the Chans\nand Montebello was whether the Contract's liquidated damages provision was enforceable. We\nhave already held that the liquidated damages provision was enforceable, and that Montebello\nwas therefore entitled to keep the Initial Payment. All of the Chans' claims against Montebello\nwere premised upon Montebello's allegedly wrongful retention of the Initial Payment. Therefore,\nMontebello demonstrated that, as a matter of law, it was entitled to summary judgment, and the\nburden then shifted to the Chans to raise a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to defeat\nsummary judgment. However, although the Chans pleaded the affirmative claims they identify\nin their petition, they did not assert any of them in response to appellees' motion for summary\njudgment, and they point to no summary judgment evidence raising a fact issue on the claims.\n\nWe therefore overrule the Chans' fourth issue.\n\n\nIV. Did the Trial Court Err in Granting Summary Judgment in Favor of Stewart Title on\nAll of the Chans' Claims for Affirmative Relief?\nIn their fifth issue, the Chans contend that, although Stewart Title was a party to the motion for\nsummary judgment, the motion did not address the Chans' claims against Stewart Title, which\nwere different than the claims against Montebello. Specifically, the Chans assert that their claims\nagainst Stewart Title were based upon an “Earnest Money Receipt” provided to the Chans, which\nstated that the Chans' earnest money would not be dispersed unless all parties agreed. 7 Despite\nthis representation, the Chans contend, Stewart Title paid the earnest money (the Initial Payment)\nto Montebello. The Chans asserted claims against Stewart Title for conversion, negligence,\npromissory estoppel, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty 8 based on\nthese alleged facts.\n\n *9 The Chans' argument in this issue is the same as that made in the previous issue against\nMontebello. The Chans assert that fact issues were raised on each of their claims against Stewart\nTitle precluding summary judgment in its favor. However, the Chans did not raise these claims\nin response to appellees' summary judgment motion or present any evidence to demonstrate that\na genuine issue of material fact existed. Moreover, in appellees' motion for summary judgment,\nappellees showed that, in response to Montebello's instruction, Stewart Title delivered the Initial\nPayment to Montebello in accordance with paragraph 2(d) of the Contract, which provided that\n“the Title Company shall cause the Initial Payment to be delivered promptly to whichever party\nshall become entitled thereto pursuant to the terms of this Contract and without further approval\nfrom either party.”\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Further, appellees\ndemonstrated that, under the Contract, the Chans agreed that Stewart Title was to deliver the Initial\nPayment to Montebello “without further approval from either party.”Thus, the trial court could\nhave correctly concluded that Stewart Title properly delivered the Initial Payment to Montebello.\nAt that point, the burden shifted to the Chans to raise a genuine issue of material fact on their claims\nagainst Stewart Title, all of which were based on the allegedly wrongful delivery of the Initial\nPayment to Montebello without the Chans' consent. In the Chans' response to appellees' motion\nfor summary judgment, they attached a copy of the Earnest Money Receipt and discussed it in\ntheir recitation of the facts, but they did not make any legal argument concerning the document or\nargue that paragraph 2(d) of the Contract did not apply. Moreover, the Chans did not assert any of\ntheir claims in response to appellees' motion for summary judgment, and, other than the “Earnest\nMoney Receipt,” they point to no summary judgment evidence raising a fact issue on the claims.\n\nWe therefore overrule the Chans' fifth issue.\n\n\nV. Did the Trial Court Abuse Its Discretion in Awarding Attorney's Fees and Considering\nAttorney's Affidavit Concerning Fees?\nIn their sixth issue, the Chans contend that the award of attorney's fees is inequitable and unjust\nunder the Declaratory Judgments Act. SeeTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 37.009 (“In any\nproceeding under this chapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's\nfees as are equitable and just.”). In their seventh issue, they contend that the trial court erred in\nfailing to sustain their objections to the affidavit of George Gibson in support of the attorney's\nfees. The Chans brief these issues together, and so we will consider them together.\n\nFirst, the Chans argue that it is fundamentally inequitable and unjust that Montebello, “who hasn't\nsustained any actual damages, and has already been awarded $92,000, should be awarded an\nadditional $20,000 attorneys fees.”The Chans complain that, “for whatever reason [the Chans] did\nnot close, they attempted to negotiate the release of the contract,” but Montebello took advantage\nof them and pushed forward with the scheduling of the walk through and closing with the specific\nintent of obtaining the earnest money. The crux of the Chans' argument appears to be that, even\nthough Montebello prevailed on its claim that it was entitled to keep the liquidated damages as\nprovided in the Contract (and agreed to by the Chans), Montebello is not entitled to attorney's fees\nto compensate it for being required to litigate the issue, because it allegedly did not incur actual\ndamages. The Chans cite no evidence or authorities to support this argument; therefore, we do\nnot consider it. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 38.1(h); Sunnyside Feedyard, L.C. v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1635881\"><a href=\"/opinion/1635881/sunnyside-feedyard-v-metropolitan-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 173 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2003, no pet.)(“Failure to either cite authority or advance\nsubstantive analysis waives the issue on appeal.”).

CIV. P. 166a(c) (“A summary judgment may be based on uncontroverted testimonial\nevidence of an interested witness, or of an expert witness as to subject matter concerning which\nthe trier of fact must be guided solely by the opinion testimony of experts, if the evidence is\nclear, positive and direct, otherwise credible and free from contradictions and inconsistencies,\nand could have been readily controverted.”); Trico Techs.

See Montiel,\n949 S.W.2d at 310. Further, whether the evidence contained in an affidavit “could have been\nreadily controverted” does not mean that the summary judgment evidence could have been easily\nand conveniently rebutted, but rather indicates that the testimony could have been effectively\ncountered by opposing evidence. Id. The trial court, as fact finder, may award attorney's fees as\na matter of law based on the uncontradicted testimony of an interested witness, “especially when\nthe opposing party has the means and opportunity of disproving the testimony or evidence and\nfails to do so.”Ragsdale, 801 S.W.2d at 882.\n\nAs one of appellees' attorneys, Gibson averred that he was licensed to practice in Texas and had\npreviously represented clients in connection with commercial litigation in Harris County, he was\nfamiliar with the fees customarily charged by attorneys in Harris county for handling similar\nsuits, and was familiar with the attorneys' services normally required for the proper prosecution\nof lawsuits like the present one. Gibson identified and listed the specific legal services performed\nin connection with the prosecution of the lawsuit, and opined that additional hours of his time\nwould be necessary for post-judgment motions and to enforce the judgment. He further opined\nthat, taking into consideration the complexity of the case, the legal questions involved, and the\ntime involved, a reasonable attorney's fee for the legal services rendered to Montebello would be\n$20,000. Finally, he opined that a reasonable additional attorney's fee for an appeal to the court of\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In response, the Chans asserted their objections, but offered no opposing affidavits or\nother contradicting evidence to challenge Gibson's opinions concerning the attorney's fees incurred\nor to be incurred, and whether or not they were reasonable or necessary. Therefore, we cannot\nsay the trial court abused its discretion to the extent it considered Gibson's affidavit in awarding\nattorney's fees to Montebello. We overrule the Chans' sixth and seventh issues.\n\n\nVI. Did the Trial Court Err in Granting Summary Judgment by Failing to Exclude the\nAffidavit of Jeanette Harris?\nLastly, in their eighth issue, the Chans contend that the trial court erred in granting summary\njudgment by failing to exclude the affidavit of Jeanette Harris, an employee of The Interfin\nCompanies LP, a partner of Montebello. Appellees submitted Harris's affidavit to support the\nmerits of their motion for summary judgment. In her affidavit, Harris made statements concerning\nMontebello's substantial completion of the unit and its performance of all work and obligations\nunder the contract, the Chans' failure to respond to Montebello's attempt to contact the Chans, the\nChans' failure to contact Montebello to schedule a specific time for or attend the closing, and the\nparties' rights and obligations under the Contract. The Chans contend that these statements are\nmerely factual and/or legal conclusions, no extrinsic evidence was offered to support them, and\nthey cannot be readily controverted. 12\n\nHarris averred that she was an employee of The Interfin Companies LP, a partner of Montebello,\nand that the facts stated in her affidavit were within her personal knowledge and were true\nand correct. Her factual statements were supported by documents and correspondence attached\nto appellees' motion for summary judgment, which she referenced in her affidavit, and which\nreflected that Harris either sent the document, was the recipient of the document, or was copied\non the document. Moreover, although the Chans submitted the affidavit of Mrs. Chan in response\nto the motion for summary judgment, Mrs. Chan did not contradict any of the factual statements\nHarris made concerning Montebello's substantial completion of the unit, the Chans' failure to\ncommunicate with Montebello concerning scheduling, or the Chans' failure to attend the closing.\nThus, we cannot say that the trial court erred to the extent that it may have considered the factual\nstatements that could have been controverted by the Chans, but were not.\n\nAlthough some of Harris's statements concerning the legal effect of the Contract, such as her\nassertion that Montebello was entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees and court costs in\naccordance with the Contract, constituted legal conclusions, nothing in the record demonstrates\nthat the trial court considered any conclusory statements or based its decision on them.

We will not reverse a trial\ncourt's judgment because of an erroneous evidentiary ruling unless the ruling probably caused the\nrendition of an improper judgment. See Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v.

Price sitting by assignment.\n\n1    The Chans also asserted that they were entitled to arbitration under the Contract, but arbitration is not an issue in this appeal.\n\n2    The record does not reflect that the trial court ruled on the Chans' objections to the summary judgment proof. Additionally, although it\n        appears the trial court held a hearing on the motion for summary judgment, no reporter's record of the hearing is included in the record.\n3       The language indicating finality was as follows:\n              It is further\n              ORDERED that Defendants are granted judgment in their favor as to all claims and cause of actions by Chiu Moon Chan and Ella\n              Y.

It is further\n              ORDERED that Defendants shall be entitled to all writs and processes necessary to enforce this judgment. It is further\n              ORDERED that all other relief not specifically granted herein is denied and that this is a final appealable judgment.\n4       As an initial matter, appellees assert that, because penalty is an affirmative defense and the Chans failed to plead it, the issue is waived.\n        However, the Chans raised the issue of penalty in its response to appellees' motion for summary judgment and in supplemental\n        responses in opposition to the motion. We therefore conclude the issue is preserved for appeal. See Keck, Mahin & Cate v. Nat'l Union\n        Fire Ins.

After arriving at the location, Cathy was told that her stylist would not\nbe able to style her hair, so she agreed to let Andrew Guerra, one of the Appellees, style her hair.\n\nCathy did not model in the show but, instead, sat backstage while her hair was being colored\nand styled. While sitting backstage, a representative of Appellees requested permission to use\nphotographs of Cathy for marketing purposes. Cathy was asked to sign a document granting\nAppellees permission to use her photograph and releasing them from liability for future claims\narising from their services or products. According to Cathy, she was informed that the form she\nsigned permitted use of her photograph, but she was never told she was also releasing Appellees\nfrom future liability.\n\nThe coloring and treatment products were applied to Cathy's hair at approximately 8:45 a.m. and\nremoved at approximately 2:00 p.m. During that time period, multiple individuals worked with\nCathy's hair, sometimes with lengthy intervals between activity. When Cathy expressed concern\nabout the amount of time the chemicals had been on her hair and scalp, she was assured the\nchemicals had not been on her hair too long. Around 2:00 p.m., the chemicals were washed out\nof Cathy's hair.\n\nWhen Cathy awoke the next morning, she noticed that her hair was beginning to fall out. Within\na few weeks, Cathy lost all of the hair on her body. Cathy was diagnosed with alopecia areata\nuniversalis, which is a medical condition that causes rapid loss of all hair on one's body. There\nis no treatment for the condition, and it is likely permanent. It is alleged that Cathy's condition\nmanifested as a result of her prolonged exposure to the chemicals used by Appellees.\n\nIn April of 2011, the Charbonnets filed suit against Appellees. Cathy and Mr. Guerra were deposed\nin February of 2012. In April of 2012, Appellees filed motions for summary judgment. After a\nhearing on the motions, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees. The\nCharbonnets then filed a motion for new trial, and it was overruled by operation of law.\n\n\n\n                                              THE RELEASE\n\nA.

Did the Release Provide Fair Notice?\n *2 In their second point of error, the Charbonnets claim the trial court erred in granting Appellees'\nmotions for summary judgment because there are fact issues concerning whether the release\nsigned by Cathy provided fair notice that she was releasing Appellees from liability for their\nown negligence. The Texas Supreme Court has developed fair-notice requirements that must\nbe met when parties attempt to exculpate themselves, in advance, from liability for their own\nnegligence.

Whether a release of liability fulfills the\nrequirements of fair notice is a question of law for the court. Dresser, 853 S.W.2d at 509. Thus,\na release that does not satisfy both fair notice requirements is unenforceable as a matter of law.\nStorage & Processors, Inc. v.

A release of future liability is\nconspicuous when it draws the attention of a reasonable person looking at the face of the document\nsuch that the person ought to notice it. TEX.

The first paragraph grants Appellees\npermission to use Cathy's photo and the second paragraph releases Farouk, its representatives, its\nemployees, and its distributors 1 from liability. As is evident, the heading of the second paragraph\nstates: “YOU RELEASE ‘FAROUK’ FROM LIABILITY.” This heading is in capital letters, is\nlarger than the heading of the first paragraph, and is in a bold font. The language in the body of\nthe second paragraph is also in a larger font than the language in the body of the first paragraph\nand is in a bold font, unlike the first paragraph. It also appears the heading and body of the second\nparagraph are in a different font than the heading and body of the first paragraph. Additionally,\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Schaefer, the Charbonnets argue that the text in the body of the second\nparagraph is “nearly illegible” and that “[a]lthough capital letters are present in a few areas of\nDefendants' document, the capital letters do not effectively contrast one portion of the release from\nanother.”Specifically, the Charbonnets point to language in Littlefield stating that larger font in\nthe heading of a release is not, alone, sufficient to make the release conspicuous. Littlefield, 955\nS.W.2d at 275. Although we do not dispute the truth of this general proposition, it must be placed\nin context. The release in Littlefield contained larger headings indicating that the text was a release\nof liability, but the body of the text was printed in “miniscule typeface” that was smaller than\nthe surrounding text and was placed in the bottom left corner of the document. Id. at 274–75.The\nstatement cited by the Charbonnets was explaining that merely using larger headings indicating\na release of liability will not suffice when the signatory has no idea what claims he is releasing\nbecause the text is too small to read. Id. at 275.The release in this case is nothing like the release\nin Littlefield.The release signed by Cathy contained not only a larger heading, but also text of a\nlegible size in a bold font.\n\nThe Charbonnets also appear to assert that Cathy was misled about the contents of the document,\nclaiming that she was informed only that the document granted Appellees permission to use her\nphotograph. The Charbonnets never alleged fraud, nor did they point to any authority holding\nthat a less-than-complete or misleading description of a document's contents can defeat a release\nthat provides fair notice of its contents. Thus, any such contention is waived by the Charbonnets.\nTEX.R.APP. P. 33.1; TEX.R.APP. P. 38.1. Because the document containing the release was only\nabout half of a page in length and contained only two paragraphs, and because the language of the\nrelease was legible and distinguished from the surrounding texts in multiple ways, we conclude\nthe release signed by Cathy was sufficiently conspicuous to put a reasonable person on notice of\nits existence and terms.\n\n\nC. Can a Pre–Injury Waiver of Liability Release Appellees from Liability for a Subsequent\nMisrepresentation?\n *4 In their fourth appellate point, the Charbonnets argue that a pre-injury waiver of claims cannot\nrelease a party from liability for misrepresentations or warranties made after the waiver is signed.\nThe Charbonnets cite no authority supporting their contention that a valid waiver does not operate\nagainst future wrongdoings of Appellees. Moreover, since a pre-injury waiver is designed to\nrelease a party in advance from liability, future wrongdoings would generally be encompassed\nwithin the scope of the waiver.

A release “operates to extinguish the claim or cause of action\nas effectively as would a prior judgment between the parties and is an absolute bar to any right\nof action on the released matter.”Dresser, 853 S.W.3d at 508.In light of the existing law on this\nissue, and in the absence of any contrary authority provided by the Charbonnets, we overrule their\nfourth appellate issue.\n\n\nD. Was the Release Invalid As Against Public Policy to the Extent It Purported to Waive\nClaims of Gross Negligence?\nIn their third point of error, the Charbonnets contend Texas public policy prohibits Appellees\nfrom obtaining an advance waiver of their liability for gross negligence. Appellees assert that the\nCharbonnets have not preserved this claim for appellate review because they did not specifically\nplead gross negligence as a cause of action or raise the issue in their response to Appellees' motions\nfor summary judgment. The Charbonnets argue that their factual allegations put Appellees on\nnotice of their gross-negligence claim and that gross negligence is only negligence of a different\ndegree, not type, so it does not have to be separately pleaded. Assuming, without deciding,\nthe Charbonnets' factual assertions in their pleadings were sufficient to permit proof of gross\nnegligence at trial, the Charbonnets' argument regarding the public policy of prohibiting waiver\nof gross negligence is not properly preserved for our review.\n\nThe purpose of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c) is to require motions for summary judgment,\nresponses, and other replies to provide adequate information to the opposing party and to define\nthe issues to be determined for summary judgment.

The motions for summary judgment in this case were\npredicated on the affirmative defense of release of liability, and release of liability was first asserted\nas a defense to the Charbonnets' claim in an original answer filed on May 13, 2011. Therefore, the\nCharbonnets had knowledge of and could have sought discovery related to the release for almost\na year before the motions for summary judgment were filed.\n\nWith regard to the materiality of and reason for needing additional discovery, the Charbonnets\nprovide no specific reason why the additional depositions are material to their case. Instead, the\nCharbonnets generally assert that they need the deposition of various corporate representatives\nand “other individuals with knowledge of relevant facts surrounding the putative release.”The\nCharbonnets do not name most of the corporate representatives or “other individuals” they seek\nto depose, nor do they state what information they expect any of these individuals to provide.\nSeeTEX.R. CIV. P. 252. Moreover, it is unlikely that any further testimony or evidence would aid\nthe trial court in its decision on Appellees' motions for summary judgment because the validity of\na release of liability is a question of law to be decided by the court. Dresser, 853 S.W.2d at 509.\n\nFinally, the Charbonnets have wholly failed to make a showing of due diligence. Although\nthe Charbonnets contend they had an agreement with Appellees that multiple other corporate\nrepresentatives and witnesses would be produced for depositions, they cite no evidence of such\nagreement. In contrast, Appellees point to a Rule 11 Agreement made on January 9, 2012\nthat shows the parties' agreement that Farouk would produce Andrew Guerra for deposition in\nFebruary. The agreement also reflects Appellees' intention to “file their summary judgment motion\non the release and have it set for hearing as soon as possible.”Thus, this agreement reflects the\nCharbonnets' intention to allow the summary-judgment motions to proceed in exchange for the\nopportunity to depose Guerra.\n\nBased on the length of time the Charbonnets had notice Appellees were asserting the release of\nliability as an affirmative defense, the vague and general assertions of the need for additional\ndiscovery, and the absence of evidence suggesting the exercise of due diligence in obtaining\ndiscovery prior to the filing of the motion for summary judgment or the hearing thereon, we\nconclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Charbonnets' motion for\ncontinuance.\n\n\n\n                                              CONCLUSION\n\n *8 Because the release signed by Cathy was conspicuous and because the Charbonnets had\nadequate time to obtain discovery, we conclude the trial court did not err in granting summary\njudgment in favor of Appellees.

The State Bar, we held, is by itself powerless to address the harm alleged by the indigent\nlitigants, as its authority in this regard is limited to proposing regulations to the Court. We then\nrejected any attempt to involve the district court in the regulation of the practice of law: “[T]o\nthe extent the remedies are sought against the Supreme Court, they would clearly impinge on the\nCourt's exclusive authority to regulate the practice of law.... No subordinate court in Texas has the\npower to usurp our authority or responsibility in this area.” Id. at 246.\n\nRelators interpret this language as this Court's assumption of exclusive original jurisdiction over\nany action affecting attorneys in Texas. In so doing, they misconstrue our decision in Gomez.\nFirst, we observed that the Court's inherent powers, such as the power to regulate the bar,\nare administrative powers, not jurisdictional powers. Id. at 245. We then held that a district\ncourt could not impose a new requirement on Texas attorneys because “a district court has no\nauthority to assume this Court's authority to regulate the legal profession.” Id. at 246. Unlike the\nplaintiffs in Gomez, Relators do not seek imposition of new regulations on lawyers in Texas,\nbut rather challenge the constitutionality of a statute that affects lawyers. Yet, as we noted in\nGomez, constitutional challenges to rules enacted by this Court must be brought in the district\ncourt and heard by this Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. “Had this Court\nactually promulgated rules establishing a pro bono program and had Gomez challenged the\nconstitutionality of such rules, the district court would have jurisdiction to decide, in the first\ninstance, whether such rules met constitutional standards.... Such a case would be justiciable\nbecause the district court would be capable of rendering a judgment that accords the parties\ncomplete relief, subject of course to appellate review.” Id. at 246. Analogously, Relators must\nfollow the same procedure in challenging the constitutionality of the Attorney Occupation Tax. A\nlitigant may not bring such a claim in the first instance in this Court.\n\nAccordingly, without hearing oral argument, see Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 122, a\nmajority of this Court overrules Relators' motion for leave to file an original petition for writ of\nmandamus and writs pursuant to Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 121 and 122.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.

Appellant was also required to\npay interest to appellee and property taxes on any of the 144 lots for which legal title had not\nbeen acquired.\n\nBetween October 1978 and October 1980, appellant “took down” only 30 lots. Additionally,\nappellant stopped making tax and interest payments to appellee. Consequently, in October, 1980\nappellee notified appellant that the contract was cancelled. In response thereto, appellant filed suit\nalleging that appellee had breached his contract by failing to deliver lots with construction of the\nroads in accordance with the City of Stafford and Federal Housing Authority (FHA) specifications.\nAppellee filed a counter-claim, alleging that appellant's failure to pay property taxes and interest\nconstituted a material breach of the contract.\n\nThe jury found that appellant materially breached the contract and found that appellee suffered\ndamages in the amount of $71,820 based on the lost profits on the non-sale of 114 residential lots.\n\nIn its first two points of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in entering judgment\nbased on the jury's response to special issue numbers 11 and 12 because appellant did not have\na contractual obligation to pay property taxes as they accrued or to pay interest to appellee in\nOctober 1980. Thus, as a matter of law, such failure did not constitute a material breach of the\ncontract in question.\n\nIn response to special issues 11 and 12, the jury specifically found that appellant's failure to pay\ninterest and property taxes as they accrued to appellee in October 1980 constituted a material\nbreach of the contract.\n\nAppellant relies on his contractual interpretation of paragraphs II (b) and (c) of the contract of\nsale to substantiate his contention.

Some of the conditions\nwhich the seller is required to fulfill are described in paragraph I(a):\n\n  Seller agrees to the following:\n\n  (a) Seller shall clear the street right-of-way and utility easements within Kingsway, it being\n  understood that (1) any additional clearing shall be done by Buyer at its expense, and (2) Seller\n  shall minimize damage to the trees within Kingsway; (b) each lot or reserve being conveyed\n  shall be free of trash, garbage, or any improvements not contemplated hereby, and except for\n  clearing of trees, be in a condition suitable for commencement of construction of single family\n  detached housing; ...\n\nAppellant claims that because appellee failed to keep each lot free of trash, the appellee had not\nfulfilled the conditions which activate appellant's responsibility for taxes and interest. The appellee\nargues that the language does not constitute a condition precedent, but merely a covenant, the\nbreach of which might be a defense to any contract action by appellee against appellant.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Wilfin, Inc., supra.\n [8] Evidence of appellee's lost profits was provided by Mr. Webster, who was the president and\nsole stockholder in appellee's corporation. Mr. Webster testified without objection that the costs of\nappellee's performance included a 10% down payment on its lots owned by Mr. Shipwash, which\nwere to be resold by appellee to appellant.\n\nThe appellee had contracted to pay Mr. Shipwash $9720 per lot. Appellee then contemplated\nselling these same lots to appellant for $11,500 each.\n\nAppellant had paid a down payment of 10% or $1,150 per lot to appellee, and had contracted to pay\nthe remaining $10,350 per lot over a period of three years. Appellee had anticipated that his gross\nprofit would be $630 per lot. Appellant's breach of contract, after purchasing only 30 of the 144\nlots, caused appellee to lose $630 profit on each of the remaining 114 lots, or a total of $71,820.\nMr. Webster's testimony provided competent evidence of appellee's “benefit of the bargain” which\nincluded lost profits. Appellant's third, fourth, and fifth points of error are overruled.\n\nIn its sixth point of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in awarding appellee damages\nbecause the damages awarded were barred by the liquidated damages clause contained in the\ncontract for deed.\n\nThe contract for deed provided as follows:\n\n           Seller shall give Buyer thirty (30) days written notice of any default hereunder\n           and should the Buyer fail to correct such default within ten (10) days from receipt\n           of notice, Seller, its successors or assigns, shall have, as its sole remedy the right\n           to declare this agreement terminated and Buyers earnest money forfeited.

What courts really do in those cases is to permit the parties to estimate in\n  advance the amount of damages, provided they adhere to the principle of just compensation.\n  Restatement of Contracts, Sec. 339, accurately expresses the rule as follows:\n\n     (1) An agreement, made in advance of breach fixing the damages therefor, is not enforceable\n     as a contract and does not affect the damages recoverable for the breach, unless\n\n     (a) the amount so fixed is a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm that is\n     caused by the breach, and\n\n     (b) the harm that is caused by the breach is one that is incapable or very difficult of accurate\n     estimation. (emphasis added)\n\nIn Stewart, the court held that the “stipulated damage provision” in a lease would be treated as\na penalty because the provision was not narrowly drawn or limited to the breach of any one\nmajor covenant, but could also be triggered by the breach of a trivial or unimportant covenant.\nThe Texas *727 Supreme Court emphasized that the provision did not adhere to the rule of\n“just compensation.” Id.

The parties' intention in making the provision is not controlling in\nthis respect. Loggins Construction Co., supra; Brace v. Dante, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1782998\"><a href=\"/opinion/1782998/brace-v-dante/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—Dallas 1971, no writ).\n\n [10] Applying this principle of law to the contractual provision before this court, we conclude\nthat the parties intended that the provision constitute an estimate of their damages in the event of a\nbreach. However, the amount fixed is not a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm\ncaused by any breach of the contract.\n\nThe provision states that “upon any default hereunder by the buyer” or “in the event of default”\nby the seller, the sole remedy shall be the retention, or refund respectively, of any earnest money\ntendered. The defect in this provision which makes it a penalty rather than a liquidated damage\nprovision, is that upon the occurrence of any default, even a minor one, by either party, the injured\nparty may terminate the contract and keep over $160,000 in earnest money as damages.\n\n [11] A provision becomes a penalty if it provides for unreasonable damages for trivial breaches\nas well as reasonable damages for major breaches. Stewart, supra; Bethel, supra; and Mayfield,\nsupra. It is immaterial that the actual breach was for default in tax and interest payments. Mayfield,\nsupra. If the seller failed to keep any one lot entirely free from trash, or if the buyer paid the taxes\nbut failed to furnish seller with a copy of paid tax receipts, either injured party could terminate the\ncontract and demand to keep the earnest money. Certainly, such minor breaches could not be held\nto warrant termination of the contract plus the award or retention of any earnest money.\n\nBecause the clause in this case subjects the parties to the same reparation for any default under the\ncontract, we hold that the provision is a penalty rather than one of liquidated damages. Therefore,\nthe trial court did not err in awarding damages to appellee and the appellant's sixth point of error\nis overruled.\n\n [12] In its last point of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in awarding damages\nto appellee based on the jury's response to special issue 13 because the appellee receives an\ninequitable windfall, recovering both the earnest money and $71,820 in lost profits. Appellant\ncontends that this result is inequitable in that the award grants recovery of both liquidated damages\nand recovery of profits.\n\nIn special issue 13, the jury was instructed to consider only those losses, if any, the payment of\nwhich would place appellee as nearly as possible in the position it would have occupied had the\nappellant performed the contract. The jury was further instructed to consider only those damages\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Appellee points out that except for the\ndefective liquidated damages provision, the contract does not provide that the earnest money must\nbe returned once the parties began performance. Appellee urges this court to find that the jury\nrightfully considered the “realities of the transaction made the basis of this lawsuit.”\n\nThe jury had sufficient evidence before it from which it could conclude that the retention of\nappellant's earnest money by appellee did not adequately compensate appellee for the harm caused\nby appellee's breach and did not place appellee in the position it would have occupied had the\nappellant performed the contract.\n\nThe record reflects that the earnest money contracted for and received by appellee reduced the\namount of the outstanding purchase price. Both parties agree that between November 10, 1978\nand March 1979, appellant closed or “took down” 30 lots under the contract for deed. Moreover,\nappellant paid approximately $222,021 in interest on lots not taken down. Several homes were\nbuilt and sold on the lots “taken down.” Clearly, both parties had begun performance of the three-\nyear contract. This is important because there is no evidence that any of the “earnest money” was\nplaced in an escrow account to secure performance of the contract. In fact, appellee testified that\nthe majority of the money appellant paid to appellee was immediately passed to Mr. Shipwash\nin order to pay off the appellee's debt to Mr. Shipwash on the parallel contract. The record also\nreflects that appellee subtracted the amounts received from appellant on the “taken down” lots,\nincluding the $165,000 earnest money, before appellee computed his lost profits.\n\nTherefore, the jury's finding, that appellee would need an additional $71,820 in order to be fairly\nand reasonably compensated for damages sustained by appellant's breach, was supported by the\nevidence and did not constitute a “double recovery.” Appellant's seventh point of error is overruled.\n\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The assets to be sold were listed in Exhibit A to the PSA, which was further divided\ninto three sub-parts. Exhibit A–3 of the PSA identified “Leases and Lands” to be conveyed,\nincluding oil and gas leases, wells, mineral interests, and associated assets located in DeSoto\nParish, Louisiana. Under the PSA, the assets included all of Devon's right, title, and interest in and\nto the oil and gas leases, lands, and wells described in Exhibit A as follows:\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, [Devon] agrees\n  to sell, and [KCS] agrees to purchase and pay for, all of [Devon]'s right, title and interest in\n  and to the following (less and except for the Excluded Assets, collectively, the “Assets ”):\n\n  (a) the oil and gas leases more particularly described in Exhibit A, subject to any depth\n  restrictions described in Exhibit A (collectively, the “Leases ”), together with any and all other\n  rights, titles, and interests of [Devon] in and to (i) the leasehold estates created thereby,\n  subject to any depth restrictions described in Exhibit A and to the terms, conditions, covenants,\n  and obligations set forth in the Leases and/or Exhibit A and (ii) the lands covered by the\n  Leases or included in Units with which the Leases may have been pooled or unitized, subject\n  to any depth restrictions described in Exhibit A (the “Lands ”), including in each case, without\n  limitation, fee interests, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, production payments, net\n  profits interests, carried interests, reversionary interests, and all other interests of any kind or\n  character;\n\n  (b) all oil and gas wells located on the Leases and the Lands or on other leases or lands with\n  which the Leases and/or the Lands may have been pooled or unitized (collectively and including\n  the wells set forth on Exhibit A, the “Wells ”), and all Hydrocarbons produced therefrom or\n  allocated thereto.\n\n(Emphasis added). The PSA also included a forum selection clause specifying that Texas law\napplied and that all actions arising out of or related to the PSA would be exclusively litigated in\nHarris County.\n\nAfter about six weeks of due diligence, the parties closed the deal on April 13, 2005. At the closing,\nDevon executed various deeds conveying the assets to KCS, including a “Deed, Assignment and\nBill of Sale” conveying the DeSoto Parish properties (the DeSoto Deed). Although the parties had\nnegotiated revisions to some of the deeds during the due diligence period, Exhibit A to the DeSoto\nDeed contained the same properties that were previously listed on Exhibit A–3 of the PSA, with\nno revisions other than the addition of recording information. On April 18, 2005, the DeSoto Deed\nwas recorded in the public records of DeSoto Parish.\n\nAbout five years later, a dispute arose between KCS and Devon concerning the scope of the mineral\ninterests Devon conveyed to KCS in DeSoto Parish. That dispute is the subject of this lawsuit.\nKCS contends that Devon intended to convey all of its right, title, and interest in two mineral\nservitudes 1 known as the “Olin Mathieson *208 Servitude” and the “Riverwood Servitude”\nburdening ten sections of land. Conversely, Devon maintains that its conveyance was restricted to\nspecific wells or wellbores located within the two mineral servitudes. For convenience, we will\nrefer to the properties at issue as the “Disputed Properties.”\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Devon contends that, after it filed that petition, EXCO Resources, Inc., another\noil and gas company, informed Devon that KCS was claiming an interest in wells in which Devon\nhad retained an interest under the PSA. Recognizing that Devon and KCS “had different views\nregarding what interests were intended to be conveyed by the PSA,” Devon argues that it filed this\ndeclaratory action in Texas in accordance with the PSA's forum-selection clause.\n\nKCS disputes Devon's account. According to KCS, EXCO contacted both Devon and KCS in\nthe fall of 2009 to confirm who owned the Disputed Properties in connection with EXCO's plans\nto drill new wells in the area and, rather than acknowledge KCS's ownership, Devon seized an\nopportunity “to re-gain the now highly valuable” mineral interests. According to KCS, Devon\nsought to maintain its suit in both Louisiana and Texas by challenging the conveyance of different\nsections of the Disputed Properties in each action. KCS also argues that Devon's original pleadings\nin the Texas action sought a declaration as to the parties' rights under the DeSoto Deed and an\nadjudication of title to Louisiana real property, not declaratory relief under the PSA.\n\nLitigation over the Disputed Properties proceeded in both Texas and Louisiana. In response to\nDevon's Louisiana petition, KCS answered and filed a counterclaim to have its rights under\nboth the PSA and the DeSoto Deed declared in its favor, as well as alternative claims for fraud,\nmisrepresentation, and violations of Louisiana law. KCS later amended its request for declaratory\nrelief to seek a declaration as to the DeSoto Deed only. The Louisiana case has since been stayed\npending the completion of the present case.\n\nIn the Texas action, KCS filed a motion to dismiss Devon's request for declaratory relief. Because\nDevon originally sought a declaration as to the parties' rights under the PSA and the DeSoto Deed\nin the Texas action, KCS argued that the Texas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to interpret\nthe DeSoto Deed and declare title to the Disputed Properties in Louisiana. The trial court treated\nKCS's motion as a plea to the jurisdiction and conditionally granted it, but allowed Devon the\nopportunity to amend its original petition.\n\nDevon then amended its pleading to seek a declaration of the parties' intent regarding the\nconveyance of the Disputed Properties under the PSA alone. In response, KCS again challenged\nthe court's jurisdiction over Devon's amended claims, arguing that the court must look first to the\nDeSoto Deed, not the PSA, because the conveyance provisions of the PSA had been merged into\nand were superseded by the conveyance provisions of the later-executed DeSoto Deed. The trial\ncourt denied KCS's motion, but stated that it would be willing to revisit the issue of subject matter\njurisdiction later in the proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Although the trial court\nheld a hearing on the motion, it made no ruling for several months. As the trial date approached,\nKCS amended its pleadings to file counterclaims for declaratory relief and alternatively, claims\nfor fraud and negligent misrepresentation, subject to its jurisdictional challenge. Devon also filed\na second amended petition.\n\nThe trial court granted KCS's motion for summary judgment on March 27, 2012, and ordered that\nDevon “take nothing” on its claims. Devon filed a motion to modify the trial court's summary\njudgment order, arguing that the trial court's ruling on the merits was improper and that the proper\nrelief was to dismiss Devon's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Shortly after that,\nKCS nonsuited all of its counterclaims except for its counterclaim for attorney's fees and costs as\nprovided in the declaratory judgments act.\n\nAlmost a year later, on March 25, 2013, the trial court granted Devon's motion to modify and\nentered a final judgment dismissing Devon's declaratory judgment claims and KCS's attorney's\nfees claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

Summary of the Parties' Arguments\nIn its motion for summary judgment, KCS argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to interpret\nthe conveyance terms of the PSA because any decision on that issue would be an impermissible\nadvisory opinion that would not resolve the parties' dispute concerning the ownership of the\nDisputed Properties. KCS contended that the declaratory relief Devon seeks would be advisory for\nthree reasons: (1) the PSA merged into the DeSoto Deed, so only the deed controls the respective\nrights of the parties; (2) the parties' intent under the PSA was superseded and mooted by the\nexecution of the DeSoto Deed; and (3) the statute of frauds bars enforcement of any declaration\nsince the PSA lacks the requisite recording information contained only in the DeSoto Deed.\nAccording to KCS, the final DeSoto Deed establishes the interests that were actually conveyed, and\ntherefore any disagreement between the parties concerning ownership of the Disputed Properties\nmust be resolved by a Louisiana court because the law is well-settled that Texas courts lack subject\nmatter jurisdiction to determine title to real property located in another state.\n\nOn appeal, Devon argues that the declaratory relief it seeks does not amount to an advisory opinion\nconcerning a question of title to land in Louisiana because the PSA was not merged into or\nsuperseded by the DeSoto Deed, the dispute regarding the meaning of the PSA is not moot, and\nthe statute of frauds does not apply. Devon also contends that its claims arise directly out of the\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Analysis of the Parties' Arguments\n\nA. Merger of the PSA into the DeSoto Deed and Mootness\n\n\n        1. The PSA is Merged Into, Superseded By, and Mooted by the DeSoto Deed.\n\nIn its summary-judgment motion, KCS first argued that any decision construing the PSA would\nbe an advisory opinion because the DeSoto Deed is the controlling *211 instrument under the\nmerger doctrine. The Supreme Court of Texas has long recognized that the conveyance provisions\nin a contract for the sale of real property merge into the deed executed in accordance with the\ncontract. Alvarado v.

The court held that the deed alone controlled\nthe terms on which the property was conveyed and superseded any other agreement between the\nparties regarding the conveyance terms, the consideration, and the method of payment:\n\n           [I]n the absence of fraud, accident or mistake in the execution, the deed, an\n           absolute conveyance on its face, must be considered the final expression and\n           the sole repository of the terms upon which [the parties] have agreed with\n           respect to the property conveyed, the consideration and the method of payment.\n           Although ... certain rights of appellee are still governed under the contract,\n           such as the furnishing of water, restrictions and easements, ... the matter of\n           consideration and method of payment were finalized in the deed which was an\n           absolute conveyance of the property in question.....

Consequently, a determination\nof the parties' intent under the PSA would be no more than parol evidence, admissible only in the\nevent a Louisiana court finds that the conveyance terms of the DeSoto Deed were ambiguous or\nwere procured by fraud. See GXG, Inc., 977 S.W.2d at 416 (“principles of law permit referral to\nagreement upon which deed is founded to explain an ambiguity in deed”). Because the Louisiana\ncourt has made no such determination, and may never do so, the declaration Devon seeks would be\npremised on the happening of a future, hypothetical event. Thus, KCS argues, any such declaration\nwould be advisory because it would not resolve the ownership of the Disputed Properties conveyed\nby the DeSoto Deed. See Stop #N Go Mkts. of Tex., Inc. v.

See Satterwhite, 413 S.W.2d at 909;\nCarter, 476 S.W.2d at 915. This conclusion is consistent not only with the case law but also with\nthe practical application of the doctrine. Devon's own land manager testified that anyone seeking\nto determine what properties were actually conveyed to KCS would need to review the exhibits\nattached to the deeds executed at the closing of the transaction—not the exhibits attached to the\nPSA that was executed six weeks earlier—because the exhibits to the PSA were not revised to\nreflect any changes made when properties were removed or added to the deal as a result of the\ndue-diligence process. The parties' agreement to apply Texas law to the construction of the PSA\nfurther compels the application of this settled Texas doctrine.\n\nApplying the doctrine of merger, any interpretation of the PSA would not resolve the issue as to\nwho owns the Disputed Properties because the final DeSoto Deed establishes the interests that were\nactually conveyed. 2 The declaration Devon seeks will have no determinative legal *213 effect on\nthe parties' controversy over ownership of the Disputed Properties conveyed by the DeSoto Deed,\nas only the Louisiana court has the ability to adjudicate title to realty. Because any declaration of\nthe parties' intent under the PSA would not resolve the parties' dispute, the declaration Devon seeks\nwould be advisory only and therefore the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider\nit. See, e.g., Patterson v. Planned Parenthood of Houston and Se. Tex., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1572956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1572956/patterson-v-planned-parenthood-of-houston-and-southeast-texas-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 443\n(Tex.1998); Tex.

Devon's Contrary Arguments Concerning Merger and Mootness are Unpersuasive.\n\nDevon contends that the trial court erred in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction\nover the parties' dispute because the PSA was not merged into, superseded by, or mooted by the\nDeSoto Deed. Discussing the merger and superseded contract doctrines together with mootness,\nDevon argues these doctrines do not apply because (1) the PSA survived the closing and did\nnot address the same subject matter as the DeSoto Deed; and (2) KCS made allegations of fraud\nand misrepresentation regarding the PSA and also sought reformation of the PSA. Because the\nPSA was neither merged into nor superseded by the DeSoto Deed, Devon asserts, the controversy\nregarding its meaning is not moot.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See Harris v. Rowe,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1722044\"><a href=\"/opinion/1722044/harris-v-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 306–07 (Tex.1979); Stanford Dev.

Devon argues that the PSA contains\na number of independent rights and obligations that survived closing, such as an agreement to\ncooperate in effectuating the intent of the PSA and detailed indemnification provisions. Devon\nalso points to language in the DeSoto Deed that “the execution and delivery of this Assignment ...\nshall not operate to release or impair any surviving rights and obligations of Assignor or Assignee\nunder the [PSA].” Further, Devon argues that as a practical matter, the parties continued to revise\nleases and assignments under the PSA even beyond the closing date, something they would not\nhave done if the DeSoto Deed rendered the PSA moot.\n\nIn response, KCS does not dispute that certain provisions of the PSA survived beyond the\nexecution of the deeds at the closing, but argues that Devon's argument ignores the actual dispute\nbetween them, which concerns the scope of the conveyance as it relates to the Disputed Properties\nrather than any of the PSA's surviving terms. We agree. Devon's cited authorities concern disputes\nover collateral terms, not disputes over terms of the conveyance that were merged into the\nsubsequently executed agreement. For example, in Harris v. Rowe, the Texas Supreme Court\nheld that an escrow agreement pertaining to funds for post-conveyance construction work was\ncollateral to and independent of the conveyance terms in the purchase contract. 593 S.W.2d at\n306–07. Likewise, in Stanford Dev. Corp., the court of appeals held that arbitration provisions\nin homeowners' earnest money contracts created rights collateral to and independent of the deeds\nto their condominiums that were not merged into and extinguished by the subsequent deeds. 285\nS.W.3d at 52.\n\n *214 [17] Here, the dispute between Devon and KCS does not involve the PSA's surviving\ncollateral terms, such as the right to transfer properties after closing. It involves the scope of the\nconveyance itself and whether Devon conveyed the Disputed Properties to KCS based on the\ndescriptions provided in the DeSoto Deed. Under the PSA, Devon agreed to convey all of its\n“right, title and interest” in and to the described assets, and Devon points to nothing in the PSA\nindicating that the parties intended to retain some legal or equitable interest in those assets, and it\nis undisputed that the descriptions of the properties conveyed in the exhibits to both the PSA and\nthe DeSoto Deed are the same. Devon's reliance on the collateral-rights exception is misplaced\nand does not defeat the application of the merger doctrine.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See, e.g.,\nSuperior Laminate & Supply, Inc. v. Formica Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1890987\"><a href=\"/opinion/1890987/superior-laminate-supply-v-formica-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448–49 (Tex.App.-Houston\n[14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied) (“A merger occurs when the same parties to an earlier agreement\nlater enter into a written integrated agreement covering the same subject matter.”). Devon contends\nthat it was clearly not the intent of the parties that the PSA be merged into, superseded by, or\nmooted by the DeSoto Deed because the parties included in the DeSoto Deed the statement that\nthe Deed was “expressly made subject to” the PSA.\n\nThese arguments also fail because the parties' actual dispute is confined to the ownership of the\nDisputed Properties, which are addressed by both the PSA and the DeSoto Deed. None of Devon's\nauthorities support its argument that because the PSA involves properties in addition to those\nconveyed in the DeSoto Deed, the merger doctrine does not apply to a property addressed by\nboth instruments. That the deal included other assets in other states has no bearing on the parties'\ndispute over the assets conveyed in Louisiana. For the same reason, we reject Devon's argument\nthat the DeSoto Deed's language that it is made “subject to” the PSA indicates the parties' intent\nthat the PSA would not be merged into, superseded by, or mooted by the DeSoto Deed. The\nevidence shows that although revisions were made to the exhibits attached to the deeds during the\ndue-diligence process, the exhibits to the PSA describing the properties to be conveyed were not\ncorrespondingly revised. Thus, the deeds, rather than the PSA, reflect the parties' final agreement\nas to which properties were conveyed to KCS. Moreover, as KCS argues, if the conveyance terms\nof the DeSoto Deed were “subject to” the PSA, then the revisions the parties made to deeds during\nthe due-diligence period would be irrelevant. Such a construction of the DeSoto Deed would also\nundermine the purpose of the merger doctrine. Therefore, both the evidence and the case law are\nconsistent with the application of the merger doctrine in this case. See Alvarado v. Bolton, 749\nS.W.2d at 48 (stating that when a deed is delivered and accepted as performance of a contract to\nconvey, the contract is merged into the deed).\n\n\n\n(b) KCS's Dismissed Counterclaims Do Not Preclude Application of the Merger Doctrine.\n\nSecond, Devon argues that the merger doctrine does not apply because KCS made allegations of\nfraud and misrepresentation regarding the PSA, and also sought reformation of the PSA. See, e.g.,\nGXG Inc., 977 S.W.2d at 416 (“The doctrine of merger is inapplicable when there is an allegation\nof fraud, mistake, or accident, *215 or an ambiguity in the contract.”); see also Givens v.

Thus,\nthe counterclaims were not live pleadings when the final order on KCS's summary-judgment\nmotion was modified and signed on March 25, 2013. 3 Second, all of KCS's counterclaims were\nin opposition to Devon's requested declarations as to the PSA and called into question Devon's\nconduct leading up to the execution of the PSA, not the DeSoto Deed. The cases Devon cites\nare distinguishable because they each address allegations of fraud or reformation relating to\nexecution of the subsequent deed, not the preliminary contracts for sale like the PSA. As KCS\nacknowledges, it could not have sought an interpretation of the DeSoto Deed because the trial\ncourt lacks jurisdiction over such a claim.\n\nWe conclude that Devon has failed to demonstrate that the merger doctrine is inapplicable to this\ncase.\n\n\nB. The PSA's Forum Selection Clause\nDevon's lead appellate argument is that the trial court's ruling was erroneous because the PSA's\nforum selection clause requires that the parties' dispute be litigated in Harris County. This clause\nprovides that the PSA and the parties' legal relations shall be governed by Texas law, that all parties\nto the PSA consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction by Texas courts for any action arising\nout of the PSA or other transaction documents, and that “[a]ll actions or proceedings with respect\nto, arising directly or indirectly in connection with, out of, related to or from” the PSA “shall be\nexclusively litigated in courts having sites in Houston, Harris County Texas.”\n\nDevon argues that its declaratory judgment action must be litigated in Harris County because the\nrelief Devon sought in its amended petition required a judicial determination of the intent of the\nparties to the PSA. Devon notes that Texas' public policy strongly favors the freedom of parties\nto contract, so long as their agreement does not violate the law or public policy. See BMG Direct\nMktg., Inc. v. Peake, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894692\"><a href=\"/opinion/894692/bmg-direct-marketing-inc-v-peake/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 (Tex.2005); In re Prudential Ins.

Devon\ndoes not argue that the forum selection clause somehow confers subject matter jurisdiction on the\ncourt, nor do Devon's cited cases so hold. The law is well settled that parties may by agreement\nconsent to personal jurisdiction and venue in a given court, but subject matter jurisdiction cannot\nbe conferred merely by agreement of the parties. See, e.g., Burke v. Satterfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1514634\"><a href=\"/opinion/1514634/burke-v-satterfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n953 (Tex.1975) (“It is also fundamental ... that the subject matter jurisdiction of a court cannot\nbe enlarged by an agreement between the parties or a request that the court exceed its powers.”);\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Adjudication of Title to Land in Another State\nDevon next argues that Texas courts have subject matter jurisdiction to determine obligations\nunder a contract that may involve land located in another state, and that this action is such a case.\nAccording to Devon, the trial court has jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment action because\nit does not involve a “naked question of title.”\n\n [19] As Devon acknowledges, Texas courts have no subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate title\nto realty, including interests in oil and gas leases, in another state or country.

In Devon's second amended petition,\nDevon sets out in detail the dispute between it and KCS over the extent of the mineral interests\nconveyed. 4 Devon describes the *217 nature of the present action as seeking “a determination\nof the parties' intent with respect to certain Louisiana mineral interests described in Exhibit A–3\nof the PSA.” In its request for relief, Devon further states:\n\n\n  By the present action, Devon does not seek a construction of the [DeSoto Deed], or a\n  determination or adjudication of title to the Louisiana properties listed in the PSA.

Such an action must\n   necessarily precede any action to adjudicate title....\n   Devon then requests specific declarations that (1) the parties intended to include in “the PSA\n   transaction” only Devon's interest in specifically named wells located on specific sections of the\n   lands described on Exhibit A–3 to the PSA pertaining to DeSoto Parish, Louisiana, and not all of\n   Devon's right, title and interest in the mineral servitudes; and (2) the parties intended to exclude\n   from “the PSA transaction” three additional sections of land in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana.\nThroughout its pleading, Devon insists that the controlling document is the PSA and not the\nDeSoto Deed, and restricts its requested relief to an interpretation of the parties' intent under\nthe PSA. It is evident, however, that the relief Devon ultimately seeks is the resolution of the\ndisagreement between it and KCS as to which of them owns the Disputed Properties in Louisiana.\nNotably, Devon first filed suit in Louisiana, claiming that it owned the mineral interests KCS\nhad mortgaged. And when Devon originally filed this lawsuit in Texas, it requested declarations\nregarding ownership of the Disputed Properties under both the DeSoto Deed and the PSA. Only\nafter the trial court granted KCS's plea to the jurisdiction did Devon amend its pleadings to argue\nthat the dispute could be resolved by interpreting the PSA alone. Moreover, although Devon relies\non cases like McElreath for the proposition that a Texas court has subject matter jurisdiction to\norder a conveyance of out-of-state property, neither party has requested such relief. Instead, Devon\nrequests a declaration of the Louisiana mineral interests it intended to convey.\n\nThe other authorities on which Devon relies are also distinguishable. See Hartman, 863 S.W.2d\nat 766 (affirming trial court's jurisdiction to determine the validity of a contract for the sale and\nexchange of certain oil and gas properties in New Mexico because the “trial court was not required\nto determine ownership of land in New Mexico nor was any relief sought requiring the transfer\nof title to land in New Mexico”); Protech of Tex., Inc. v.

Disposition of Devon's Appeal\nWe conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing Devon's claims for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction on the basis that Devon's requested declaratory relief sought an impermissible advisory\nopinion concerning Devon's conveyance of mineral interests located in Louisiana.

According to KCS, a trial court has\njurisdiction to adjudicate a defendant's claim for costs and attorney's fees when the defendant\nsucceeds on its claim that the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claim\nfor declaratory relief.\n\nIn response, Devon argues that when a trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a case from\nthe time of filing, the only action the court may take is to dismiss the case. To hold otherwise\nwould be contrary to controlling case law, the plain language of the UDJA, and those courts which\nhave distinguished between cases in which the court had subject matter jurisdiction and lost it\nand those in which the court never properly acquired subject matter jurisdiction. As above, when\nreviewing whether subject matter jurisdiction exists, we review the trial court's ruling de novo.\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n\nA.

Accordingly, the court concluded that\n\n           Castro invoked the entire [UDJA] when she filed suit.

But these cases are distinguishable and do not control the disposition of\nKCS's issue.\n\nIn Reeves, the plaintiff sought attorney's fees in connection with a breach of contract claim and an\nidentical claim for declaratory relief. 978 S.W.2d at 256. This Court reversed the trial court's award\nof attorney's fees because the plaintiff recovered no damages and so could not recover attorney's\nfees under Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Id. at 257–58. Further, the\ncourt held that the plaintiff could not use a request for declaratory relief identical to his breach of\ncontract claim “simply to pave the way to recover attorney's fees not otherwise available.” Id. at\n258–59. The Reeves court went on to note that the plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief “should\nhave been dismissed by the trial *220 court because it was moot” and therefore the plaintiff was\nnot entitled to recover fees on the basis of either breach of contract or declaratory judgment. Id. at\n259–60. In a single paragraph, the court addressed the defendant's second issue as follows:\n\n           In its second point of error, [the defendant] argues that even if there was a\n           legal basis for an award of attorney's fees to [the plaintiff], the court abused its\n           discretion and, if anything, should have awarded fees to [the defendant]. Having\n           found no legal basis for awarding attorney's fees to [the plaintiff] we likewise\n           find no legal basis for awarding such fees to [the defendant]. Therefore, [the\n           defendant's] second point of error is overruled.\n\nId. at 260. In other words, having concluded that the plaintiff improperly invoked the UDJA to\nrequest the same relief already sought under his breach of contract claim, the court held that\nthe UDJA was not a proper procedural vehicle to award either party attorney's fees. In contrast,\nDevon's UDJA claim was not duplicative of any other claim or urged solely for the purpose of\nobtaining attorney's fees; Devon properly invoked the UDJA when it filed its original petition\nseeking a declaration of the rights, obligations, and legal status of the parties under the PSA and\nthe DeSoto Deed.\n\nGraves is factually distinguishable because in that case only the defendants sought affirmative\ndeclaratory relief and attorney's fees. The defendants' requested relief was denied for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction, so fees were not warranted.

The Graves\ncourt's decision was also based on its determination that the declaratory judgment and fee award\nwere an abuse of discretion because the lawsuit did not involve the construction of a deed to the\ndefendants' property as recited in the trial court's judgment; it involved the manner in which the\ndefendants made use of their property, and no deed was even offered into evidence. Id. at *10.\nThus, the court concluded there was no basis in the record for the trial court to award either a\ndeclaratory judgment or attorney's fees under the UDJA. Id.

According to Devon, the section of the UDJA allowing an award of\nattorney's fees is a subset of the larger Act, and a trial court without jurisdiction under the Act\ncannot selectively assert subject matter jurisdiction over the remedies section of the Act to award\nfees.\n\n [23] Initially, we note that decisions of the federal courts, other than the Supreme Court, may\nbe persuasive in a state court or a federal matter, but in this appeal they are not binding.

The court in\nIn re Knight, on which Devon relies, expressly acknowledged that courts can award fees even in\nthe absence of subject matter jurisdiction when those fees are authorized by statutes and rules that\nare non-substantive. See 207 F.3d at 1117.\n\nUnder the UDJA, the trial court has authority to award attorneys' fees and costs “[i]n any\nproceeding under this chapter.” See *222 Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code § 37.009. By seeking\ndeclaratory relief, Devon initiated a “proceeding under this chapter” that falls squarely within the\nplain language of Section 37.009. In response, KCS properly pleaded an ancillary claim for relief\nunder the statute through its counterclaim for attorneys' fees. See id. § 37.004. KCS's fee claim\nwas likewise a “proceeding under this chapter” and thus remained viable even though Devon's\naction was properly dismissed.\n\nAlso unpersuasive is Devon's claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award fees because the\nUDJA was not “properly invoked” from the outset. None of the cases Devon relies on involve the\nabsence of subject matter jurisdiction over the primary claim. The references to properly invoking\nthe statute in these cases relate only to proper pleading and improper attempts to use the UDJA\nto recover fees when they are not available under the substantive law that serves as the basis\nfor the plaintiff's claims. See Knighton, 856 S.W.2d at 210–11 (holding that trial court did not\nabuse its discretion to deny request for attorney's fees when the record reflected that the trial\ncourt recognized that both parties pursued legitimate rights and therefore each should bear its own\nattorney's fees); Hartford Cas.

Devon argues that these cases are\ndistinguishable, however, because they involve situations in which a trial court properly had\nsubject matter jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action at the outset of the case but then\nlater, because of subsequent actions, lost jurisdiction. As support for its contention, Devon cites\nto Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. v. Rambus, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432501\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432501/samsung-electronics-co-ltd-v-rambus-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481 (E.D.Va.2005). In that\ncase, the court stated that “[w]here a court is divested of its subject matter jurisdiction over the\nsubstantive claim by virtue of intervening mootness, it nonetheless retains jurisdiction to ‘consider\ncollateral issues after an action is no longer pending.’ ” Id. at 482. But the court went on to state\nthat, in contrast, “lack of subject matter jurisdiction over a substantive *223 claim serves ‘to bar\nan award of attorney's fees where an action was moot at the time of filing.’ ” Id. at 481.\n\n [25] We conclude that, under Texas law, the point in time when the court lacked subject matter\njurisdiction over Devon's predicate claims is irrelevant to KCS's fee claim. Although Hallman\nand Camarena involved situations in which the court lost subject matter jurisdiction during the\npendency of the litigation because the plaintiff's claims became moot, the same analysis applies\nto a situation in which the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims from\nthe inception of the case. See Hallman, 159 S.W.3d at 642 (“[A] dispute over attorneys fees is a\nlive controversy.”) (citing Camarena, 754 S.W.2d at 151).\n\nFor example, this Court has recognized that attorneys' fees may be awarded to a defendant\nunder the UDJA when the plaintiff who sought declaratory relief lacked standing to assert its\nclaims.

In Lohec, when this Court found that the intervening plaintiff\nlacked standing to assert his declaratory judgment claims, this Court necessarily determined that\nit lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his claims from their inception. 814 S.W.2d at 754–55.\nNevertheless, this Court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to decide whether it would be\nequitable and just to award fees to the defendant.

We further hold that the trial court did not lose subject matter jurisdiction\nover KCS's counterclaim for attorney's fees when it determined that it lacked subject matter\njurisdiction over Devon's request for declaratory relief, and therefore the trial court erred when it\ndismissed KCS' claim for attorney's fees and costs under the UDJA.

KCS sought to recover these fees only under Texas Civil Practice\nand Remedies Code section 37.009, and there is no other apparent basis on which KCS might\nrecover these fees. 2 The trial court determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over both\nDevon's declaratory-judgment claims and KCS's section 37.009 claim and therefore dismissed all\nclaims without prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nIn determining parties' entitlement to attorney's fees, Texas courts follow the American Rule,\nwhich provides that litigants may recover attorney's fees only if a statute or contract specifically\nprovides for such a recovery. 3 Thus, in determining whether a party may recover attorney's fees,\nTexas courts must interpret and apply the statute or contract under consideration, rather than\ncrafting judge-made rules to supply the legal standard to be applied. 4 In today's case, the only\npossible authority under which KCS might recover attorney's fees is section 37.009.\n\n\nTo recover attorney's fees under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 37.009, the\nclaimant must do so in a proceeding under the Texas Declaratory Judgments Act, and a claim\nfor fees is not such a proceeding.\n\nSection 37.009, entitled “Costs,” provides in its entirety that “[i]n any proceeding under this\nchapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's *225 fees as are\nequitable and just.” 5 We are to review the trial court's interpretation of applicable statutes de\nnovo. 6 In interpreting a statute, our objective is to determine and give effect to the Legislature's\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

KCS's claim for these attorney's fees was ancillary to Devon's claims and\nthe trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Devon's claims. Thus, the trial court did not\nerr in dismissing all of these claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. 16\n\n *226 The issues raised by KCS's cross-appeal have not been addressed by a precedent from\nthe Supreme Court of Texas or from this court, and three sister courts of appeals have reached\nthe opposite conclusion. Without citing any authority in support of the proposition, the sister\ncourts determined that the absence of subject-matter jurisdiction over claims from filing through\ndismissal does not affect the nature of these claims. 17 But, the lack of jurisdiction is fundamental,\nand its absence has a material effect on both the trial court proceeding and the analysis of the issue\non appeal. The lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Devon's declaratory-judgment claims from\nthe moment of filing until the moment of dismissal makes the proceedings void. 18\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In the Camarena case, which did not involve section 37.009, the high court held that a live\nissue still existed between the parties as to whether the trial court erred in denying the plaintiff's\nrequest for attorney's fees even though it granted the plaintiffs the other relief they requested. 23\nThe Camarena court held that, although the issues regarding the other relief granted in the trial\ncourt's judgment later had become moot, the issue as to whether the trial court erred in denying\nthe plaintiff's request for attorney's fees was not moot. 24 Significantly, in Camarena, the trial\ncourt had subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims from filing through the initial rendition of\njudgment, and the fee request denied by the trial court addressed attorney's fees during the period in\nwhich the trial court *227 had subject-matter jurisdiction. 25 The Camarena court did not address\nwhether the plaintiffs were seeking fees for the time period after the other issues became moot or\nwhether the trial court had jurisdiction over such a request, and this silence does not create any\nprecedent on this issue. 26 In any event, there is a significant difference between a case in which\nthe trial court never has subject-matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims and a case in which\nthe trial court lost jurisdiction over the claims after rendition of judgment.\n\nThe Hallman case involved an appeal from the trial court's denial of attorney's fees requested\nunder section 37.009 in an insurance dispute in which other issues in the case became moot while\nthe case was pending in the Supreme Court of Texas. 27 The Hallman court held that the issue as\nto whether the insurer had a duty to defend was still a live controversy because it would determine\nwhether a remand was necessary for the trial court to consider whether to change its denial of the\nfee request in light the new prevailing party on that issue. 28 Even presuming that the insured was\nseeking attorney's fees for the period after the issues became moot, the case is not supportive of\nDevon's position because the Hallman court did not address whether the trial court had jurisdiction\nover such a request, and this silence does not create any precedent on this issue. 29\n\nIn Galveston County Commissioners' Court v. Lohec, this court reversed the trial court's ruling on\nthe merits of declaratory-judgment claims, held that one plaintiff lacked standing, and remanded\nto the trial court to consider the defendant's request for attorney's fees under 37.009. 30 The\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  24\n\fDevon Energy Production Co., L.P. v. KCS Resources, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014)\n\n\n\nSupreme Court of Texas disagreed with this court's disposition regarding the declaratory relief,\nreversed this court's judgment, and rendered judgment, so the case was never remanded. 31 In\nLohec, no party raised the issue of whether the trial court had jurisdiction over the defendants'\nrequests for attorney's fees against the plaintiff who lacked standing, and this court did not opine\non the matter. 32 The Lohec court did not address whether the trial court had jurisdiction over\nsuch a request, and the court's passing over this issue in silence does not create any precedent. 33\nThus, the issue appears to be one of first impression in this court. Instead of following the sister\ncourts of appeals, this court instead should look to the plain language of the statute and analogous\nfederal *228 authority and hold that the lack of subject-matter jurisdiction precludes an award\nof attorney's fees under section 37.009.\n\n\n\n                                                              Conclusion\n\nThe Texas Legislature has the authority and know-how to enact a statute providing that a trial\ncourt may award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees to a defendant who succeeds in having a\nplaintiff's declaratory-judgment claims dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. To date,\nthe Texas Legislature has not done so. The trial court correctly ruled that it lacked subject-matter\njurisdiction over Devon's declaratory-judgment claims; therefore, the proceedings relating to these\nclaims are void. Because there are no such proceedings, there is no basis for awarding KCS\nreasonable and necessary attorney's fees under section 37.009. KCS's claim for attorney's fees was\nancillary to Devon's claims, over which the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. The trial\ncourt did not err in dismissing all of these claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. To the\nextent this court reverses this ruling, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    A mineral servitude is “the right of enjoyment belonging to another for the purpose of exploring for and producing minerals and\n       reducing them to possession and ownership.” La.Rev.Stat. § 31:21.\n2      Because of our disposition of this issue, it is unnecessary to reach the parties' arguments concerning the applicability of the statute\n       of frauds.\n3      In its reply brief, Devon argues that KCS's counterclaims were live pleadings when the trial court initially granted KCS's summary-\n       judgment motion on March 27, 2012, and that the trial court's final judgment on March 25, 2013 “did nothing to alter its earlier March\n       27, 2012 order.” We note that the 2012 order denied Devon's request for declaratory relief and granted a take-nothing judgment\n       against Devon, while the 2013 order dismissed Devon's declaratory judgment action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and also\n       dismissed KCS's counterclaim for attorney's fees. Although the court ruled in KCS's favor in both orders, the basis for the rulings\n       and relief granted are distinctly different. Therefore, on these facts, we look to the state of the pleadings at the time the trial court\n       signed its final judgment.\n4      KCS argues that the operative pleading is Devon's first amended petition, and not the second amended petition, which Devon filed\n       after KCS moved for summary judgment but before the trial court's judgment was signed. Devon's first amended petition did not\n       request specific declarations, but set out each party's contentions concerning the Disputed Properties and merely requests that the\n       court declare the parties' intent under the PSA. For purposes of our analysis, however, the same dispute is reflected in both petitions.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The contract provided that any\nparty wrongfully refusing to sign a release acceptable to the escrow agent of the $10,000 in earnest\nmoney was liable “to the other party for liquidated damages of three times the amount of the\nearnest money.”Dunlap failed to close by the date specified in the contract and refused to release\nthe earnest money to Gayle. Dunlap sued Gayle, asserting fraud and breach of contract. Gayle\ncounterclaimed, asserting that she was entitled to contractual liquidated damages of three times\nthe amount of the earnest money.\n\nGayle filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment and later filed a combined no-evidence/\ntraditional motion for summary judgment on Dunlap's claims and her own counterclaim. With\nregard to Dunlap's fraud allegation, Gayle asserted that Dunlap had no evidence: (1) that Gayle\nmade a material false representation to Dunlap; or (2) that Dunlap suffered damages. As to\nDunlap's breach of contract claim, Gayle asserted that Dunlap had no evidence that: (1) Dunlap\nperformed or was excused from performing under the contract; (2) Gayle breached the contract;\nor (3) Gayle's breach caused Dunlap damages. 2\n\nDunlap filed responses to Gayle's motions. 3 Dunlap attached an affidavit, dated May 23, 2011, to\nher first response and attached a second affidavit, dated November 22, 2011, to her supplemental\nresponse. Gayle objected to Dunlap's summary judgment evidence, arguing that both affidavits\nwere incompetent summary judgment evidence.\n\nOn November 30, 2011, the trial court granted Gayle's no-evidence/traditional motion without\nstating the basis for its ruling. The trial court also awarded Gayle actual damages in the amount\nof $30,000 and attorney's fees. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                     II.

Fraud\nIn her motion, Gayle challenged the “material false representation” and damage elements of\nDunlap's fraud claim. Dunlap attached to her first response: (1) her May 23, 2011 affidavit; (2) a\nsurvey plat of the property, which showed a “trash dump” located on the property; (3) a “Seller's\nDisclosure Notice,” a standardized form which requires a seller to disclose certain prescribed\nproperty “conditions,” and which reflected that there was no “landfill” on the property 4 ; (4) a\nlegal description of the property; (5) a letter from Dunlap's counsel stating her refusal to release the\nearnest money; (6) the contract for sale of the property; and (7) a letter to Dunlap from the escrow\nagent stating that she would forfeit the earnest money if she failed to complete the purchase of the\nproperty by the closing date. In her response, Dunlap asserted that Gayle: (1) falsely represented\nthe property as “pristine”; and (2) stated in the written disclosures that there was no “landfill” on\nthe property, when the plat “show[ed] a landfill.” Dunlap's response states that Gayle breached\nthe contract by not disclosing the existence of the “landfill.”\n\nIn her supplemental response, Dunlap stated that she “did not want a trash dump or a landfill” and\nthat “these two words mean essentially the same thing to her.”Dunlap also asserted that she did\nnot receive the survey, which revealed the existence of the trash dump, “until the third [November\n2007] contract.”Dunlap attached to her supplemental response: (1) an excerpt from Gayle's no-\nevidence/traditional motion for summary judgment, in which Gayle asserted her counterclaim for\ncontractual liquidated damages; and (2) Dunlap's November 22, 2011 affidavit, in which she stated\nthat “[t]he words ‘trash dump’ and ‘land fill’ mean the same thing” to her, and that she “did not\nknow about the land fill or trash dump until the third contract.” 5\n\nDunlap asserts that the evidence of a material false representation about the property consists\nof: (1) Gayle's written representation that there was no landfill on the property; and (2) Gayle's\nstatement that the property was “pristine.” Gayle responds that: (1) her representation that there\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This element requires proof that when Gayle made the\nrepresentation, she “knew it was false or made it recklessly without any knowledge of the truth\nand as a positive assertion.”Id. A false representation may consist of a deceptive answer or any\nother indirect or misleading language, and a statement that is literally true may be actionable if\nused to create an impression that is substantially false.

Dunlap has offered no evidence, however, that when Gayle checked “no landfill”\non the standardized seller's disclosure form, she intended to create an impression that was\nsubstantially false. Gayle's affidavit unequivocally stated that the areas labeled “trash dump” on\nthe survey “is not a landfill.” Her affidavit further stated that, although she has burned trash in\nbarrels in the area labeled “trash dump,” “there has never been any trash simply dumped there and\nleft.”We conclude that the presence of a “trash dump” on the property did not render Gayle's “no\nlandfill” representation false.\n\nDunlap also points to Gayle's description of the property as “pristine” as evidence of a material\nfalse representation. In her affidavit, attached to her response, Dunlap asserted that Gayle\nrepresented that the property was “pristine.” Gayle argues that, even assuming that she described\nthe property as “pristine,” such a description is mere “puffing” or opinion, and cannot constitute\nfraud.\n\nGenerally, there are three factors courts consider when determining whether a statement is\nactionable, or mere puffing or opinion.

See Humble Nat'l Bank, 933 S.W.2d\nat 230. We conclude that as used in the present context—to describe property—the term “pristine”\nis vague and indefinite in meaning and therefore cannot constitute an actionable misrepresentation.\nSee Autohaus, Inc. v.

See Aguilar, 794 S.W.2d at 463. Here, Gayle as the owner of the\nproperty was more familiar with it, and Dunlap claims that when she inspected the property, Gayle\n“distracted” her and deliberately prevented her from inspecting the area where the “trash dump”\nwas located.

SeeTEX.R. CIV. P 166a(i).\n\n\nB. Breach of Contract\n *5 Gayle's no-evidence motion asserted that Dunlap had no evidence that: (1) Dunlap performed\nor was excused from performing under the contract; (2) Gayle breached the contract; or (3) Gayle's\nbreach caused Dunlap damages. In her affidavit, Dunlap stated that Gayle breached the contract\nby failing to “disclose the landfill” on the Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition. Dunlap's\nevidence included: (1) the Seller's Disclosure, which reflected that the property did not contain a\nlandfill, and (2) the survey showing the existence of a “trash dump.”\n\nTo establish that Gayle breached the contract by failing to “disclose the landfill,” Dunlap must\npresent evidence that a landfill actually exists. We have already determined that the presence of\na “trash dump” did not render Gayle's “no landfill” representation to be false. Dunlap's affidavit\nsimply asserts that there is a landfill on the property, even though she concedes that she “has not\nseen the landfill location with [her] own eyes.”Gayle's affidavit unequivocally states that there is\nno landfill on the property and that the area labeled “trash dump” on the survey is not a landfill.\nWe hold that Dunlap has not presented evidence establishing that Gayle breached the contract\nby failing to disclose a landfill. See id.We further hold that the trial court did not err in granting\nsummary judgment on Dunlap's breach of contract claim, and we overrule Dunlap's first issue.\n\n\nC. Damages\nBy her second issue, Dunlap contends the trial court erred in awarding Gayle $30,000 in actual\ndamages because the contract provision authorizing such damages is an unenforceable penalty.\nParagraph 18(D) of the contract provides: “Any party who wrongfully fails or refuses to sign a\nrelease acceptable to the escrow agent within 7 days of receipt of the request will be liable to the\nother party for liquidated damages of three times the amount of the earnest money.”The earnest\nmoney payable by Dunlap to Gayle under the contract was $10,000.\n\nGayle responds that Dunlap's claim that a liquidated damages clause is an unenforceable penalty\nis an affirmative defense, which Dunlap was required to plead and prove. Citing Phillips v.\nPhillips, Dunlap responds that pleading the defense is unnecessary when the unenforceability of\nthe liquidated damages provision appears on the face of the pleadings.

Dunlap\nargues that under Phillips, she did not waive her penalty argument because the liquidated damages\nprovision in the contract—providing for liquidated damages of three times the amount of the\nearnest money—was unenforceable on its face. We disagree.\n\nIn Phillips, the Texas Supreme Court found that a provision which provided for liquidated damages\nten times the amount of actual damages to be an unenforceable penalty. 820 S.W.2d at 789. The\ncourt found the provision did not meet the two-prong test for determining whether to enforce a\nliquidated damages provision. See id. at 788–89 (citing Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers, Inc.\nv. Campesi, 592 s.W.2d 340, 342 n. 2 (Tex.1979)). To enforce such a provision, the court must\nfind: (1) that the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) that the\namount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation. See id. at\n788.The provision at issue in Phillips did not meet the first prong of the test because it assumed\nthat actual damages must be determined before the “ten times” multiplier can be applied. See id.\nat 789.The provision did not meet the second prong of the test because it did not forecast actual\ndamages, but called for them to be determined and then multiplied. See id.\n\nThe liquidated damages provision in the present case does not call for multiplying the amount\nof actual damages, as in Phillips. See id.Rather, it calls for trebling the agreed-upon amount\nof earnest money. 8 For these reasons, we find Phillips to be inapposite. Dunlap neither pleaded\nthe affirmative defense of penalty nor presented evidence showing that the damage award was\nexcessive. We overrule her second issue.\n\n\n\n                                             IV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Injunctive Relief\n\n [2] Defendant urges that there is no evidence, or insufficient evidence, to show that injunctive\nrelief is necessary for the protection of plaintiff's business and goodwill. Our review of the record\nreveals evidence sufficient to support the trial court's findings in this respect. The court found\nthat plaintiff had trained defendant as a job counselor in providing placement and counselling\nservices; that defendant had established and maintained substantial goodwill for plaintiff between\nhimself and plaintiff's clients and prospective clients; that defendant had access to confidential\nbusiness information, including lists of clients and business methods; that defendant resigned\nhis employment with plaintiff and began an employment agency business with his wife; that\nhe advertised the services of such agency and contacted various employers who were previous\nor prospective customers of plaintiff; that defendant had declared his intention to continue such\ncompetitive activities before he was restrained by the court; and that plaintiff's goodwill and its\nrelationship with its clients had been damaged. These findings support the court's conclusions\nthat defendant's actions constitute a material breach of his employment agreement and that\nthe injunction prayed for was reasonably necessary to protect plaintiff's goodwill from further\ncompetitive activities by defendant and safeguard plaintiff's confidential business information.\nConsequently, we hold that there is sufficient evidence to support the injunctive relief granted.\n\n [3] Defendant further contends that the contract was unenforceable because of wrongful conduct\nby plaintiff. Although defendant alleged certain breaches of the employment contract, the court\nmade no finding of fact as to that issue, and defendant made no request for additional findings\nas authorized by rule 298 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Consequently, this defense was\nwaived. Elliott v.

The injunction restrains defendant from\nengaging in the business of a private employment agency or agent within a one-hundred mile\nradius from the Dallas County Courthouse until *863 February 15, 1982, and from assisting\nin the finding of employees for employers, or employment for employees for a commission or\nfee, within that area for that period.

Damages\n\nFinally, defendant urges that the trial court erred in awarding “liquidated damages” of $7,500\nbecause the evidence is insufficient to meet plaintiff's burden of proof as to reasonableness.\nPlaintiff makes no attempt to justify the award of $7,500 as based on evidence of actual damages,\nbut presents a counterpoint urging that it is entitled to recover the $10,000 liquidated damages\nstipulated in the contract. We conclude that the trial court's award of $7,500, which it characterized\nas “liquidated damages,” cannot be supported either as actual damages or as liquidated damages,\nand that the $10,000 payment stipulated is an unenforceable penalty in view of the specific\nenforcement of the contract by injunction.\n\n [5] [6] The award of $7,500 cannot be supported as actual damages because, as defendant\ncontends, the evidence does not establish any basis for the recovery of that amount. The only\ntestimony concerning damages was by plaintiff's president, who testified that he was unable to\nstate the amount of any damages from defendant's breach of the contract other than expenses\nof litigation, including attorney's fees and loss of time by himself and other employees. There\nwas no estimate of the amount of commissions lost because of defendant's competition in the\nperiod between the termination of his employment with plaintiff on February 15, 1980, until he\nwas restrained from further competition on March 4, 1980. The trial court found that plaintiff has\nexpended $5,000 for attorney's fees and expenses of suit. This record contains neither pleading nor\nproof supporting recovery of $7,500 as either a statutory or a contractual attorney's fee. Expenses\nof litigation are not recoverable as damages unless expressly provided by statute or contract.\nHammonds v.

Plaintiff argues that the liquidated damages provision is enforceable because the\namount stipulated is payable in lieu of actual damages that are difficult to ascertain. This argument\nis inconsistent with the petition, which alleges and prays for both actual and liquidated damages.\nIf this inconsistency is ignored, we must consider whether the provision for $10,000 liquidated\ndamages is a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm expected as a result of a breach;\notherwise the provision is an unenforceable penalty.

Plaintiff insists: “It is not\nunreasonable to estimate that within a two-year period at least (four fees) from such placements\n($12,000) would be lost due to the competition of an ex-employee.” This argument assumes that\ndefendant would not be restrained by injunction during the two-year period. Actually, defendant\nwas free to compete less than three weeks, and there is no evidence that plaintiff has lost any\nbusiness because of defendant's competition within that period or that defendant violated the\ninjunction after the restraining order was issued. If enforceable, the contract would exact a payment\nof $10,000 for any breach of the restrictive covenant, whether the breach continues for only one\nday or for two years, and would authorize an injunction enforcing the restriction for any portion\nof the period remaining. Under these circumstances the $10,000 cannot be considered a genuine\npre-estimate of the harm to be suffered by any single breach. 5A Corbin, Contracts, s 1071, at 401\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Also, if actual damages are proved, plaintiff\nmay be entitled to damages for a breach that occurred before the suit was filed as well as to an\ninjunction restraining subsequent breaches. Payment of damages, however, constitutes satisfaction\nfor any injury that may be caused by the breach, whereas an injunction has the effect of a decree\nof specific performance restraining any breach that would otherwise cause damage. Therefore, if\nthe court grants an injunction preventing the breach from continuing and becoming total, it should\nnot at the same time give judgment for the full amount of liquidated damages specified in the\ncontract.

In that case, however, there was no claim for injunction; thus\nliquidated damages were not, as here, recovered in addition to injunctive relief. Rather, the contract\nprovided for a liquidated sum of $5,000 because of the difficulty of proving *865 damages, and\nthat amount was presumably fixed in lieu of all other compensation as satisfaction for a breach\nthat might continue for the entire three-year period. Consequently, we do not regard Mayhall as\ncontrary to our holding in the present case.\n\n [8] Plaintiff also argues in support of the reasonableness of the liquidated damage provision that\nthe amount stipulated is based on anticipated expenses of litigation rather than loss of business\nand goodwill from defendant's breach.

See Act of May\n27, 1999, 76th Leg., R.S., ch. 405, § 39, sec. 39.904, 1999 Tex. Gen. Laws 2543, 2598–99. The\nLegislature charged the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) with establishing minimum\nrenewable energy production requirements for all Texas electric providers. TEX. UTIL.CODE §\n39.904(c)(1). The Legislature also tasked the PUC with establishing a REC trading program. Id.\n§ 39.904(b). A REC reflects one megawatt hour (MWh) “of renewable energy that is physically\nmetered and verified in Texas.” 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(c)(13). Electric producers thus\nsimultaneously create both electricity from renewable sources and the corresponding RECs, yet\nproducers may choose to sell the two separately. Id. § 25.173(d). The REC trading program allows\nelectric providers unable to satisfy the minimum renewable energy requirements to purchase\nand hold RECs “in lieu of capacity from renewable energy technologies.” TEX. UTIL.CODE §\n39.904(b); see 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(d)(2).\n\nTXU Electric, a retail electric provider (and a different entity than TXUPM), solicited proposals\nfrom renewable energy producers to meet the new renewable energy production requirements. In\n2000, TXU Electric entered agreements with two wind farm subsidiaries of FPL: Pecos Wind I,\nL.P. and Pecos Wind II, L.P. Also in 2000, FPL acquired a third party's rights to a similar contract\nwith TXU Electric for Indian Mesa Wind Farm, L.P. Under the contracts, FPL sells TXU Electric\nRECs and the renewable electric energy used to produce those credits. TXU Electric assigned\nthe contracts to TXUPM, a power marketer and, importantly, not a retail electric provider. The\ncontracts with Pecos Wind I and II are identical. The Indian Mesa contract largely contains the\nsame provisions, but, as *62 explained below, the parties point to relevant differences in support\nof their claimed intent at the time of contracting. Two provisions of these contracts give rise to\nthis dispute: one provision governing TXUPM's transmission responsibilities and one providing\nfor liquidated damages in the event that FPL fails to meet certain production requirements.\n\nFor approximately four years, FPL failed to produce the agreed upon electricity and RECs.\nTXUPM filed suit seeking damages for FPL's breach of the contracts. FPL counterclaimed, arguing\nthat it could not meet its obligations because of congestion on the ERCOT grid. When the grid lacks\ncapacity to transmit all energy produced in an area, ERCOT issues curtailment orders instructing\ncertain facilities to cease production. FPL claims it received curtailment orders from ERCOT\nwhich, along with an unexpected lack of wind in the area, caused it to produce less energy than\npromised. FPL blamed the congestion and resulting curtailment orders on TXUPM, insisting that\nTXUPM bore responsibility to ensure transmission capacity for all energy FPL could produce.\n\nBoth parties filed motions for partial summary judgment. Each sought declaratory judgment to\nclarify the portions of the contracts relating to transmission capacity and liquidated damages.\nThe trial court issued several rulings. First, the court declared that the contracts unambiguously\nrequired TXUPM to provide all transmission services, including transmission capacity, to FPL.\nSecond, the court determined that the liquidated damages provisions in the contracts were not\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The jury also found that TXUPM owed no\ncompensatory damages to FPL for TXUPM's alleged failure to ensure transmission capacity. The\ntrial court entered judgment on the jury's verdict, ordering that (1) FPL take nothing on its claims;\nand (2) TXUPM take nothing, despite the jury's damage award, because TXUPM covered.\n\nThe court of appeals affirmed the take-nothing judgment for the damages claims but reversed and\nrendered judgment on the issues related to declaratory relief. 328 S.W.3d at 591. The court held that\nthe contracts did not require TXUPM to provide the necessary transmission capacity. Id. at 587.\nAs to liquidated damages, the court of appeals held that the provisions were enforceable because\ndamages were difficult to estimate, the $50 rate was a reasonable estimate of just compensation,\nand FPL could not meet its burden to show that the $50 rate was disproportionate to TXUPM's\nactual damages. Id. at 587–90.\n\nWe granted FPL's petition for review and address the three issues before us-whether TXUPM was\nresponsible for ensuring transmission capacity, whether the liquidated damages provisions apply\nto failure to deliver electricity, and whether the liquidated damages provisions are enforceable. 55\nTex.Sup.Ct.J. 320 (Feb. 17, 2012).\n\n\n\n                                        II.

The trial court and the court of appeals found section 2.03 unambiguous, a finding\nthe parties do not challenge. 328 S.W.3d at 584–85. We may, nonetheless, declare a contract\nambiguous, see J.M.

See Gilbert Tex. Constr., 327 S.W.3d at 133.\n\nSection 2.03(a) of the contracts, entitled “Transmission,” reads as follows:\n\n             TXU Electric shall provide, by purchasing or arranging for, all services,\n             including without limitation Transmission Services, Ancillary Services, any\n             control area services, line losses except for line losses on [FPL's] side of the\n             Delivery Point, and transaction fees, necessary to deliver Net Energy to TXU\n             Electric's load from the Renewable Resource Facility throughout the Contract\n             Term (“Required Transmission Services”).\n\nSection 1.02(a) of the contracts defines “Net Energy” as “the amount of electric energy in MWh\nproduced by the Renewable Resource Facility and delivered to the Connecting Entity.” (emphasis\nadded). Under section 2.02, a Connecting Entity owns any “transmission or distribution system\nwith which the Renewable Resource Facility is interconnected.” The Connecting Entity serves as\nthe “Delivery Point.”\n\nFPL urges a broad view of TXUPM's responsibility for transmission services. FPL contends\nthat TXUPM's obligation to provide transmission services “without limitation” encompasses the\ncapacity to deliver electricity from the Renewable Resource Facility (i.e. FPL) to the load (i.e.\nTXUPM's customer base). In support, FPL argues that Net Energy can refer only to a quantity\nand has no bearing on how and when delivery occurs. FPL further argues that the more specific\nlanguage, “from the Renewable Resource Facility,” should trump Net Energy, which is defined\nelsewhere in the contracts. See Forbau v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2455763\"><a href=\"/opinion/2455763/forbau-v-aetna-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133–34 (Tex.1994)\n(stating the rule that, in contract interpretation, a more specific provision will control over a general\n *64 statement).

In a compelling visual, FPL suggests that the transmission towers might\nburn down if FPL generated and sent electricity without an available, guaranteed path to the\nconsumer. FPL complains that TXUPM caused the grid congestion and thus prompted the resulting\ncurtailment orders. 1\n\nTXUPM interprets the contracts as placing the risk of transmission system incapacity on FPL.\nTXUPM notes that the contracts identify “lack of transmission capacity” as an “Uncontrollable\nForce” outside the reasonable control of the parties. If capacity is beyond the control of the parties,\nTXUPM questions, how then can TXUPM bear responsibility for failure to provide capacity?\nSection 4.05 of the contracts reinforces this point by making clear that FPL must pay liquidated\ndamages for failure to supply RECs even if the failure was the result of inadequate transmission\ncapacity. Finally, TXUPM argues that the contracts' definition of Net Energy binds this Court;\nincorporating Net Energy, as defined, into section 2.03 means that TXUPM owes a duty to\nprovide transmission services only after the Delivery Point. Under TXUPM's interpretation, if FPL\ncould not deliver electricity because of congestion, FPL bore the risk and, thus, must bear the\nconsequences. We agree with TXUPM's interpretation.\n\nWe begin by recognizing the apparent textual conflict. Read in isolation, section 2.03 contains\nlanguage supportive of either a broad or narrow interpretation of TXUPM's transmission service\nresponsibilities. “[F]rom the Renewable Resource Facility” implies that TXUPM would have to\nsecure transmission capacity so FPL could deliver electricity. But the use of the term Net Energy,\nwhich exists only upon FPL's delivery to the Connecting Entity, suggests that TXUPM bears\nresponsibility only if the grid possesses capacity for TXUPM to deliver any generated electricity.\n\nWe cannot interpret a contract to ignore clearly defined terms, see Frost Nat'l Bank, 165 S.W.3d\nat 313, and, thus, we must accord Net Energy its due meaning. The contracts assigned TXUPM\nresponsibility only for transmission services required to deliver Net Energy, and Net Energy\nrepresents the amount of energy produced by FPL and delivered to the Connecting Entity.\nTXUPM's responsibility for transmissions services, then, begins once FPL-generated electricity\nreaches the Connecting Entity on the grid—the Delivery Point. The contracts' use of the phrase\n“from the Renewable Resource Facility” is simply a designation of where the energy originated. It\ndoes not alter the definition of Net Energy provided in section 1.02 or in other sections throughout\nthe contracts.\n\n *65 The placement of section 2.03 in the context of all interconnection requirements\nreinforces this conclusion. Section 2.02 requires FPL to “make all arrangements ... necessary\nto interconnect ... with a transmission or distribution system,” i.e. the Connecting Entity.\nTransmission systems are owned and operated by transmission service providers. See 16 TEX.\nADMIN. CODE § 25.5(143), (144). As between the original contracting parties, the contracts\nrequired a separate agreement to address interconnection if TXU Electric was the connecting\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Between TXUPM and FPL, no such\nagreement can exist because TXUPM, as a power marketer, cannot own transmission systems.\nSee id. § 25.5(83) (defining “power marketer” to exclude owners of transmission systems). The\ncontracts obligate FPL to secure interconnection with a Connecting Entity, or transmission service\nprovider, which under the PUC rules cannot be TXUPM. See id. § 25.5(83), (143). Reading\nsections 2.02 and 2.03 together, FPL must make all interconnection arrangements so that electricity\ncan reach the Delivery Point, and TXUPM must ensure that facilities exist beyond the Delivery\nPoint to allow for delivery to consumers. These provisions do not speak to the situation here,\nwhere both parties claim to meet their responsibilities but congestion on the grid inhibits energy\ngeneration and delivery.\n\n [7] Given these facts, then, we must consider which party is responsible for congestion beyond\nthe Delivery Point. While FPL blames grid congestion on TXUPM, we believe the contracts\nrecognize such congestion as beyond both parties' control. Section 6.02(a) of the contracts\naddresses “Uncontrollable Force,” including “[e]vents or circumstances that are outside of a Party's\nreasonable control,” which “may include ... lack of transmission capacity or availability.” The\ncontracts mention transmission capacity only in this section. Congestion and curtailment issues,\nwhich affect transmission capacity and availability, must fall within this provision. Section 6.02(b)\ngoes on to excuse a party from performance in the event of an Uncontrollable Force if certain\ncriteria are met; there is no dispute that FPL did not meet those criteria.\n\n [8] Section 4.05, entitled “Effect of Outages and Uncontrollable Force,” outlines the general rule\nthat payment and other calculations in sections 4.01–.10 are not impacted by Uncontrollable Force.\nThe exception to this rule, discussed below, applies to reduce the Annual Quantity of RECs that\nFPL must produce for TXUPM only when PUC substantive rules would excuse the shortfall. The\nexception does not excuse FPL from its obligation to deliver electricity. In essence, the contracts\nallocate the risk of curtailment and congestion to FPL by clearly establishing that such events affect\ncontract obligations only in certain instances not found here. We must respect and enforce this\nassignment of risk. See Gym–N–I Playgrounds, Inc. v. Snider, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894849\"><a href=\"/opinion/894849/gym-ni-playgrounds-inc-v-snider/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 912 (Tex.2007)\n(“Freedom of contract allows parties to bargain for mutually agreeable terms and allocate risks\nas they see fit.”).\n\nTo summarize, the contracts obligate FPL to interconnect with a Connecting Entity, which cannot\nbe TXUPM. TXUPM bears responsibility for providing transmission services from the Delivery\nPoint at the Connecting Entity. To the extent that lack of transmission capacity impairs electricity\ngeneration at the wind farms, the contracts provide that such lack of capacity is an Uncontrollable\nForce and FPL, therefore, bears the risk.\n\nWe note that this analysis does not fail because of the unique nature of electricity, *66 despite\nFPL's assertions. Admittedly, electricity generation, transmission, and distribution occur almost\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

But even if electricity moves too fast to pinpoint its physical location, the parties\ncertainly can conceptualize its location for the purpose of creating energy contracts like the ones\nin question today. Several contractual provisions make this clear: section 2.03(a) assigns FPL\nresponsibility for any loss of electricity on its side of the Delivery Point; and section 3.01(b) makes\nFPL responsible for maintenance and operational compliance with ERCOT guidelines for facilities\nup to the Delivery Point. This conceptualization of electricity's location pervades the contracts,\nand the parties assigned different responsibilities and liabilities based upon that understanding.\n\nHere, ERCOT issued curtailment orders, effectively constraining energy generation, rather than\nenergy transmission. FPL was therefore prevented from generating electricity and meeting its\ncontractual obligations. Although ERCOT made final curtailment decisions, that does not mean\nthat neither party bore the risk in the event of congestion and curtailment.\n\nWe hold that the contracts did not require TXUPM to provide transmission capacity for FPL but\nrather allocated risk of inadequate transmission capacity to FPL.\n\n\n\n                                          B. Liquidated Damages\n\nWe next consider the breadth of the liquidated damages provision in section 4.04. The court of\nappeals did not address the ambiguity of the section, and neither party argues the provision is\nambiguous. We conclude that the provisions are unambiguous because we may discern a definite\nlegal meaning by construing the provisions in light of each contract as a whole. See Gilbert Tex.\nConstr., L.P. v.

TXUPM reads subsections (d) and (f) in the context of\ncontract Article IV (sections 4.01–.10), entitled “Payment, Records, and Billings.” According to\nTXUPM, because FPL simultaneously produces RECs and energy, the parties simply use RECs\nas a counting mechanism for both, rather than a term limited strictly to RECs. In support, TXUPM\nreferences section 4.02, which provides the contracts' payment terms, whereby TXUPM must\npay FPL a unified price for an Annual Quantity of MWhs of Renewable Energy comprised of\nboth energy and RECs. Sections 4.03 and 4.04(a)-(c) outline a quarterly and annual reconciliation\nprocess to smooth any discrepancies based on the differences between continuous production of\nelectricity and the quarterly issuance of RECs. Section 4.04(d), the argument goes, necessarily\nincorporates the language used in the other sections. That section states: “[FPL] may elect to obtain\nand transfer RECs to [TXUPM] that were not produced at the Renewable Resource Facility to\ncompletely or partially offset the Net Deficiency ... not to exceed the sum of (i) 20% of the Annual\nQuantity, and (ii) the Uncontrollable Force Deficiency for that year.” Thus, TXUPM argues,\nSection 4.04(d) as a whole must refer to the Annual Quantity of both energy and RECs.\n\nIn response, FPL points to the absence of “Net Energy” or “Renewable Energy” anywhere in the\nliquidated damages provisions and highlights several clauses consistent with an exclusive focus on\nRECs. First, section 4.04(d), quoted above, contains a mechanism for FPL to deliver RECs from\nanother source if FPL cannot produce the RECs at its own facilities. That provision deals only\nwith RECs, and not electricity. Second, the Deficiency Rate is tied to the PUC's substantive rules\non REC penalties. 24 Tex. Reg. 9142 (1999), adopted 25 Tex. Reg. 82 (2000), amended by 32\nTex. Reg. 5165 (2007), proposed 32 Tex. Reg. 487 (former 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(o\n)) (Pub. Util. Comm'n of Tex.).

(“In short, the parties strike\nthe deal they choose to strike and, thus, voluntarily bind themselves in the manner they choose.”).\nTherefore, the lack of reference to electricity or energy in the liquidated damages provisions is\ncritical.\n\nWhere the parties intended to address both energy and RECs, the contracts do *68 so. In section\n4.02, the payments are based on “all RECs and Net Energy produced by [FPL].” Section 4.03\ncontains explicit references to section 4.02 and the payments under section 4.02. The liquidated\ndamages provisions, in contrast, provide no such reference. We will not, as TXUPM urges,\nselectively import terms from other provisions to compensate for the absence of the term “energy”;\nrather, we conclude that the omission was intentional and deliberate.

To the contrary, other provisions recognize that RECs often receive differential\ntreatment. Section 3.03(b) provides that if TXUPM cannot take delivery of electricity, FPL may\nsell electricity to the Connecting Entity, but must then sell the REC so produced to TXUPM.\nSection 4.04(d) allows FPL to cover REC deficiencies with RECs from other sources. These\ndistinctions make sense because an electricity provider may readily obtain RECs on the open\nmarket, whereas it is more difficult for providers to arrange for substitute electricity to meet their\ncommitments.\n\nSupport for differential treatment of RECs also flows from the regulatory scheme incorporated by\nreference into the contracts.

Such events\nincluded lack of transmission capacity or curtailment orders from ERCOT. See id. (former 16 TEX.\nADMIN. CODE § 25.173(o )(4), (5)). The contracts incorporate this mechanism through section\n4.05, which reduces the Annual Quantity to the extent that Administrative Code section 25.173\nexcused penalties for REC deficiencies. In sum, the contracts reduce FPL's REC obligations when\nthe PUC provides an excuse for the deficiency.\n\nThe very inclusion of the Deficiency Rate, which reflects the actual penalty TXUPM would have\nto pay for a REC deficiency, suggests the liquidated damages clause was intended to compensate\nonly for REC deficiencies. To underscore this point, we note that when the parties entered the\ncontracts, TXU Electric was subject to regulatory penalties for REC deficiencies. See id. (former\n16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(c)(1)). If FPL failed to deliver both electricity and RECs, and\nTXU Electric consequently could not meet its REC requirements, the PUC would assess a penalty\nagainst TXU Electric. The liquidated damages clause would yield $50 per REC, or the equivalent\nof the regulatory penalty. This would compensate TXU Electric for the undelivered REC, but what\nabout the undelivered electricity? Liquidated damages would provide no compensation to TXU\nElectric for FPL's failure to deliver electricity. This belies TXUPM's assertion that the provisions\nwere intended to compensate for both RECs and electricity. We conclude that the liquidated\ndamages clauses compensate for REC deficiencies and leave common law remedies available for\nelectricity deficiencies.\n\n*69 The Indian Mesa contract further solidifies our interpretation. Section 10.02 of the Indian\nMesa contract provides that “if RECs cease to exist, then Section 4.03 and Section 4.04 of this\nAgreement will be automatically deleted.” This section preserves the agreement as an electricity-\nonly contract if RECs disappear. Because the liquidated damages provision becomes a nullity\nwithout RECs, we must conclude that the provision is intended to compensate only for REC\ndeficiencies. To do otherwise would render the provision meaningless, and this we cannot do. See\nCoker, 650 S.W.2d at 393.\n\nLimiting the liquidated damages provisions to their plain language also has the benefit of\nadvancing stability in the renewable energy marketplace, including the vital role of RECs. Under\nthe legislative scheme, RECs and energy are “unbundled.” TEX. UTIL.CODE § 39.904(b);\nERCOT Nodal Protocols § 14.3.2(1) (January 1, 2013). Electric providers may either generate\ntheir own renewable energy or purchase RECs on the open market. 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE\n§ 25.173(d), (l ). Though FPL and TXUPM chose to contract for both in this case, we should\nnot allow that fact to cloud our analysis. As amici curiae REC stakeholders have pointed out, a\ncontrary holding could impede the REC market, which facilitates renewable energy development\nby allowing prospective electric producers to secure a guaranteed long-term revenue stream.

We are loath to interfere with a functioning\nmarket when the language of the contracts does not so require.\n\nThe plain language of the liquidated damages provisions, the differential treatment of RECs and\nelectricity in the contracts, and the separate provisions of the Indian Mesa contract all support a\nlimited interpretation of a REC. We hold that the liquidated damages provisions apply only to\nREC deficiencies.\n\n\n\n                              III. Enforceability of Liquidated Damages\n\n [9] We next consider the enforceability of the liquidated damages provisions when applied only\nto RECs. FPL contends that the provisions impose an unenforceable penalty when applied to\ncompensate only for REC deficiencies. Although TXUPM argues primarily that the provisions\nreasonably forecast damages for electricity and RECs—a position foreclosed by our holding in\nthis case—TXUPM's arguments regarding the difficulty of estimation of REC-based damages\nand the reasonableness of the forecast of damages still resonate. Because the liquidated damages\nprovisions fail our test for enforceability, however, we hold the provisions unenforceable.\n\n [10] [11] [12] The basic principle underlying contract damages is compensation for losses\nsustained and no more; thus, we will not enforce punitive contractual damages provisions.\nSee Stewart v.

In Phillips v. Phillips, we\nacknowledged this principle and restated the two indispensable findings a court must make to\nenforce contractual damages provisions: (1) “the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult\nof estimation,” and (2) “the amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of\njust compensation.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 788 (Tex.1991) (citing Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers,\nInc. v.

Sup. Ct. J.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\nWe first consider the difficulty of estimating damages at the time of contracting. TXUPM\nemphasizes the uncertainty of the market for RECs. FPL counters that all parties knew a REC\nmarketplace would soon exist and provide transparent pricing by the time the obligations under the\ncontracts became due. We agree with TXUPM that damages for RECs were difficult to estimate\nat the time of contracting.\n\nThe implementing legislation for the REC scheme passed in 1999, Act of May 27, 1999, 76th\nLeg., R.S., ch. 405, § 39, sec. 39.904, 1999 Tex. Gen. Laws 2543, 2598–99, but at the time of\ncontract formation in 2000, the market for RECs did not yet exist. The nature of FPL's obligation\ncompounded the difficulty. The contracts required FPL to deliver an annual quantity of RECs.\nTXUPM could not identify the specific time, and thus the spot price in the REC market, in order\nto calculate the damage for any specific REC deficiency. Even if the contracts anticipate a healthy\nmarketplace for RECs, the uncertain success of a novel legislative scheme surely poses a challenge\nto predicting damages. Indeed, as explained previously, the Indian Mesa contract foresaw the\npotential disappearance of the REC scheme and provided for continuation of the contract in the\nevent of the scheme's demise. The uncertain marketplace for RECs suffices to meet the “difficulty\nof estimation” prong of the contractual damages test.\n\n\n\n                                B. Reasonableness of Damage Forecast\n\nWe next turn to the second prong, the reasonableness of the forecast of damages. FPL argues\nthat the liquidated damages provisions, which derive directly from the regulatory penalty scheme,\nimpose the maximum penalty in all situations. FPL points to an ameliorative provision in the\npenalty regulations that excuses REC deficiencies due to lack of transmission capacity or the\nactions of a governmental authority, such as an ERCOT curtailment. See 24 Tex. Reg. 9142 (1999),\nadopted 25 Tex. Reg. 82 (2000), amended by 32 Tex. Reg. 5165 (2007), proposed 32 Tex. Reg. 487\n(former 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(o )) (Pub. Util. Comm'n of Tex.). Many of TXUPM's\ncounter-arguments are inextricably tied to contractual damages provisions *71 based on RECs\nand electricity, and we need not acknowledge those arguments here. TXUPM does assert, however,\nthat the liquidated damages provisions were not intended as indemnity clauses and therefore are\nnot limited to application only if TXUPM were actually assessed a penalty.\n\nWe view the reasonableness of the forecast from the time of contracting.

Hicks,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2431861\"><a href=\"/opinion/2431861/mayfield-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.); accord RESTATEMENT\n(SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356 cmt. b (1981) (identifying the time of making a contract\nas the moment to measure the reasonableness of anticipated loss). We are not persuaded, as FPL\nurges, to attach a “penalty” label merely because the liquidated damages clause derives from a\n“penalty” scheme; that does not, standing alone, make it a penalty.

Further, section 4.05 of the contracts anticipates that the PUC substantive\nrules will affect the REC requirements:\n\n             The exception ... is that the Annual Quantity for a year is decreased to the extent\n             that [TXUPM] is excused from paying a penalty by reason of any event under\n             Section 25.173(o )(4) and (5) of the [PUC] Substantive Rules that adversely\n             affected production of RECs by the Renewable Resource Facility in that year.\n\nAs discussed above, former PUC rules, then found in Title 16, Section 25.173 of the Texas\nAdministrative Code, excused REC deficiencies due to lack of transmission capacity or\ncurtailment orders. 24 Tex. Reg. 9142 (1999), adopted 25 Tex. Reg. 82 (2000), amended by 32\nTex. Reg. 5165 (2007), proposed 32 Tex. Reg. 487 (former 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(o\n)) (Pub. Util. Comm'n of Tex.). The contracts therefore contemplate that REC obligations of the\nparties, and the resulting damages, are a product of and intertwined with the regulatory scheme.\nThe liquidated damages provisions attempt to integrate these ameliorative processes, and thus, on\ntheir face, reasonably forecast damages.\n\nYet the facts of this case demonstrate the chasm between the liquidated damages provisions as\nwritten and the result of the provisions under the court of appeals' judgment. First, the number of\ndeficient RECs varies significantly between TXUPM's assertion and what the regulatory scheme\nwould indicate. FPL had a collective deficiency of 580,000 RECs, yet 62% (or about 360,000)\nwere not produced because of transmission congestion and associated ERCOT curtailment orders,\nwhich are excused by the PUC rules. Id. TXU Electric was subject to PUC penalties for REC\ndeficiencies at the time of contract formation. Id. (former 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.173(c)\n(1)). Upon assignment to TXUPM, a power marketer, no party was subject to PUC penalties.\nSee 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 25.5(83) (defining power marketer as an wholesaler seller of\nelectricity who does not own generation, transmission, or distribution facilities in Texas, which\nwould exclude TXUPM from REC penalties).

If the PUC could assess a penalty against TXUPM, the penalty\nwould be based on the 220,000 RECs attributable to lack of wind, not congestion.\n\nSecond, the Deficiency Rate calculation failed to tie the damages to market value as the contracts\ncontemplate. Section 4.04(f) of the contracts allows for a Deficiency Rate of either $50 or twice\nthe annual average market value of RECs “[t]o the extent that the [PUC] determines the annual\naverage market value.” The PUC expressly declined TXUPM's request for such a determination.\nThe actual market value of a REC during the period in question ranged from $4 to $14. The fortuity\nof a PUC determination thus utterly controls the damages, irrespective of the actual market value.\nFor instance, the appropriate amount of damages should fall in the range of $8 to $28 (twice the\naverage market value), depending on what the PUC would have determined as the actual market\nvalue of a REC in each year.\n\nIn combination, this creates an unacceptable disparity. The court of appeals assessed damages\nat $29 million. If we use the REC deficiency of 220,000 (as reduced under PUC rules), and the\nreduced Deficiency Rate of $28 (the upper bound of the possible range), actual damages equal\nonly $6,160,000. To reach damages of $29 million on a 220,000 REC deficiency would require an\neffective deficiency rate of $132 per REC. The disparity grows if we consider that TXUPM also\navoided the contract price of $24 per MWh of Renewable Energy—which includes a REC and a\nMWh of electricity. Although only a portion of the $24 is attributable to the REC not purchased,\nit nonetheless would further diminish TXUPM's actual damages. In Phillips, we recognized that\na liquidated damages provision may be unreasonable in light of actual damages. 820 S.W.2d at\n788. The burden of proving unreasonableness falls to FPL. See id. The court of appeals held that\nFPL failed to meet this burden, yet the court's evaluation was based on evidence of damages for\nelectricity and RECs. 328 S.W.3d at 589–90. Our holding on the scope of the liquidated damages\nclauses limits our consideration to damages for REC deficiencies. The evidence reviewed in this\nopinion demonstrates that FPL has met its burden.\n\nPhillips did not create a broad power to retroactively invalidate liquidated damages provisions that\nappear reasonable as written. See 820 S.W.2d at 788. Nor do we create such a power here. But\nwhen there is an unbridgeable discrepancy between liquidated damages provisions as written and\nthe unfortunate reality in application, we cannot enforce such provisions. The forecast of damages\nwas flawed by its reliance on events that did not and perhaps cannot occur—a PUC determination\nof the market value of RECs and a failure to secure a regulatory excuse for curtailment-based\nREC deficiencies. When the liquidated damages provisions operate with no rational relationship\nto actual damages, thus rendering the provisions unreasonable in light of actual damages, they are\nunenforceable. See id. Because the liquidated damages provisions operate as a penalty, we hold\nthe provisions unenforceable.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(Garden Ridge) sued Advance International, Inc., and Herbert\nA. Feinberg (collectively, Advance) for breach of contract and a declaratory judgment that\nGarden Ridge had *435 complied with its contracts with Advance. Advance counterclaimed for\nbreach of contract. The jury found in favor of Advance. Although Garden Ridge accepted two\nshipments of inflatable snowmen from Advance, Garden Ridge refused to pay anything for either\nshipment, claiming that one shipment was nonconforming. Garden Ridge based its refusal to pay\non chargeback provisions outlined in the parties' contracts. Advance argued that the chargeback\nprovisions are unenforceable penalties.\n\nOn appeal, Garden Ridge argues that the trial court committed reversible error when it (1) refused\nto submit a question on prior material breach, (2) improperly instructed the jury on damages,\nand (3) commented on the weight of the evidence in its instructions on breach of contract. We\nconclude that the chargeback provisions as applied in this case are unenforceable as a matter of\nlaw as penalties, and we overrule Garden Ridge's jury charge issues. We therefore affirm the trial\ncourt's judgment.\n\n\n\n                         I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nGarden Ridge is a Houston-based chain of housewares and home décor stores. Advance\nInternational, a company owned by Feinberg, is one of Garden Ridge's vendors. In 2009, Advance\nsent Garden Ridge quote sheets for lighted inflatable holiday snowmen, which included a color\nphoto of each item and described its cost, weight, dimensions, and packaging. The two snowmen\non the quote sheets each wore a scarf, held a broom that stated “Merry Christmas” on it, and waved;\none stood eight feet tall, and the other stood nine feet tall. We refer to this snowman as “waving\nsnowman.” Advance then sent two sample snowmen 1 to Garden Ridge; one of the samples did not\nmatch its quote sheet. The sample eight-foot snowman wore a Santa-type hat and held a “Merry\nChristmas” banner. We refer to this snowman as “banner snowman.”\n\nGarden Ridge sent Advance two purchase orders, one for approximately 950 nine-foot waving\nsnowmen (PO #721), and the other for approximately 3,500 eight-foot waving snowmen (PO\n#743), based on the quote sheets. Garden Ridge planned to sell each nine-foot waving snowman for\n$59.99, and each eight-foot waving snowman for $39.00. Garden Ridge planned to mark down the\neight-foot waving snowmen to $20.00 each during its one-day Thanksgiving Shop–a–Thon sale,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The nine-foot snowmen that\nAdvance sent were waving snowmen. Garden Ridge decided to honor the $20.00 Shop–a–Thon\nprice on the nine-foot waving snowmen. There were no customer complaints, and both the eight-\nfoot banner snowmen and the nine-foot waving snowmen sold well.\n\nThe parties' contracts consist of the purchase orders, the vendor cover letter, and the vendor\ncompliance manual. Based on liquidated-damages provisions outlined in the vendor compliance\nmanual, Garden Ridge assessed chargebacks against Advance for its alleged noncompliance\nviolations. For Advance's “purchase order” violation—by sending the eight-foot banner snowman\ninstead of the waving snowman, Garden Ridge charged back to Advance the entire merchandise\ncost plus the cost of freight on PO #743 as a “unauthorized substitution” chargeback, which\ntotaled *436 $49,176.00. In addition to paying nothing for the eight-foot banner snowmen,\nGarden Ridge paid nothing for the nine-foot waving snowman despite the fact that those snowmen\ncomplied with PO #721. Garden Ridge charged back to Advance the entire merchandise cost\nplus the cost of freight on the nine-foot waving snowmen as a “merchant initiated” chargeback,\nwhich totaled $29,178.00. Additionally, from September through November 2009, Garden Ridge\nassessed another $13,241.84 in noncompliance chargebacks to Advance on other merchandise\nfor “ticketing/packing” violations involving not marking cartons sequentially or otherwise\nmislabeling them, and for “purchase order” violations involving short or incomplete orders.\n\nAdvance demanded payment for its snowmen and other items and staged protests at Garden\nRidge's headquarters. Thereafter, Garden Ridge sued Advance for breach of contract and a\ndeclaratory judgment that Garden Ridge had complied with the contracts. Advance counterclaimed\nfor breach of contract and asserted that Garden Ridge's claims were barred because the chargeback\nprovisions are unenforceable as penalties. Garden Ridge defended against Advance's counterclaim\nby asserting that Advance breached the contracts first.\n\nAt trial, Garden Ridge's divisional merchandise manager/vice president Linda Troy admitted that\nGarden Ridge made approximately $113,000 in profit on the snowmen it received from Advance,\nand further testified that Garden Ridge made all the money it would have made if the snowmen\nwere delivered exactly as ordered. One of Garden Ridge's buyers, Sheria Cole, admitted she\ndid not know of any dollar amount that Garden Ridge was harmed by the snowmen shipment\nand that Garden Ridge had less-than-zero receipt cost for the snowmen. Cole also testified that\nshe was unaware of anyone at Garden Ridge having done any actual-harm calculations from\nthe unauthorized substitution of the eight-foot banner snowmen or any calculations to determine\nwhether Garden Ridge's chargebacks were reasonably proportional to any actual harm it suffered.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

On Garden Ridge's declaratory-judgment claim, the jury found\nthat Garden Ridge did not comply with the terms of the three listed agreements (to purchase the\neight-foot snowmen, to purchase the nine-foot snowmen, and to purchase other items listed in the\n“summary of chargebacks” exhibit). On Advance's breach-of-contract claim, the jury found that\nGarden Ridge failed to comply with these agreements by failing to pay for the eight-foot snowmen,\nthe nine-foot snowmen, and other items listed in the chargeback exhibit. The jury, in separate\nfindings, awarded Advance damages in the amount of $49,176.00 for the eight-foot snowmen,\n$29,781.00 for the nine-foot snowmen, and $500.00 for other items listed in the chargeback\nexhibit. The trial *437 court rendered final judgment on the jury's verdict and on a stipulation\nfor legal fees.\n\nGarden Ridge appeals the trial court's final judgment, arguing in three issues that the trial court\ncommitted reversible error in its jury charge. First, Garden Ridge contends that the trial court\nerred in refusing to submit a jury question on Garden Ridge's affirmative defense of prior material\nbreach. Second, Garden Ridge argues that the trial court erred by improperly instructing the jury in\nthe damages question on the reasonableness of Garden Ridge's chargebacks. Third, Garden Ridge\ncomplains that the trial court's inclusion of instructions on acceptance and contract price in the\nbreach-of-contract question were improper comments on the weight of the evidence.\n\n\n\n                                                 II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Refusal to submit prior-material-breach question\nGarden Ridge concedes that it is not entitled to a jury question on prior material breach if this court\ndetermines that the chargeback provisions are unenforceable as penalties. Thus, we first proceed\nto address the legal question of whether the chargeback provisions are enforceable.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Do the chargeback provisions at issue assess liquidated damages or penalties?\n\nThe parties agree that this case is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted by\nTexas, which applies to transactions involving goods. TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.102\n(West 2009). 2 The parties agree that section 2.718(a) of the UCC, on liquidation of damages,\ngoverns the enforceability of the chargeback provisions in this case. Section 2.718(a) provides:\n\n\n   (a) Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount\n      which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the\n      difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an\n      adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.\n   Id. § 2.718(a). The parties also agree that if the chargeback provisions governing Advance's\n      noncompliance violations at issue are unenforceable as penalties, Garden Ridge no longer\n      has any basis to argue that Advance committed any prior material breach. 3 But what the\n      parties do not agree on is the proper analysis by which courts determine the legal question of\n      whether a liquidated-damages provision is unenforceable as a penalty.\n\n\n         a.

BUS. & COM.CODE § 2.718(a)).\nThe Phillips court explained that one way a party can “show that a liquidated damages provision\nis unreasonable” is by showing that “the actual damages incurred were much less than the amount\ncontracted for,” which requires the party “to prove what those actual damages were.” Id. Thus, in\nsuch a case, “factual issues must be resolved before the legal question can be decided.” Id. Phillips,\nhowever, involved no fact issues because the contractual provision at issue “by which one party\nagrees to pay the other some multiple of actual damages for breach of the agreement does not\nmeet either part of the legal test for an enforceable liquidated damages provision.” Id. at 789. The\nPhillips court therefore declared the provision at issue—which called for “liquidated damages ten\ntimes the amount [the limited partner] loses as a result of” a breach of trust—unenforceable as a\npenalty on its face. Id. at 787, 789.\n\nThe common-law test as described in Phillips closely tracks the language of section 2.718(a) of\nthe UCC. The code allows damages to be liquidated “only at an amount which is reasonable in\nthe light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss,\nand the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.” TEX. BUS.\n& COM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a). It further states: “A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated\ndamages is void as a penalty.” Id. The first clause of section 2.718(a)—“reasonable in the light\nof the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach”—correlates to “reasonable forecast of just\ncompensation,” from the common-law test. See id.; Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. The second and\nthird clauses of section 2.718(a)—“the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-\nfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy”—correlate to “that the harm caused by\nthe breach is incapable or difficult of estimation,” from the common-law test. See TEX. BUS. &\nCOM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a); Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. Further, the sentence that “[a] term\nfixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is *439 void as a penalty” under section 2.718(a)\ncorrelates to “a liquidated damages provision is unreasonable because the actual damages incurred\nwere much less than the amount contracted for.” See TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a);\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. We therefore conclude that the common-law test as described in\nPhillips and the UCC test as outlined in 2.718(a) reflect the same essential factors and the same\ntype of reasonableness test. Thus, common-law case law continues to inform our analysis here.\n\n\n\n                                       b. Do actual damages matter?\n\nGarden Ridge argues that the test is conducted entirely on an ex ante basis. That is, if, at the time\nthe contract is formed, actual damages are difficult to estimate and the amount specified in the\ncontract is a reasonable forecast of just compensation, a liquidated-damages term is enforceable.\nGarden Ridge contends that the test contains no ex post actual-harm assessment to determine\nreasonableness. Thus, according to Garden Ridge, Advance could only show that the chargeback\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Garden Ridge asserts that Advance did\nnot meet its burden because Garden Ridge's CFO, Bill Uhrig, testified that the chargeback schedule\nwas created because actual damages from noncompliance violations are difficult to calculate, and\nthat the schedule was based on computations and estimations by Garden Ridge's executive and\npurchasing staff.\n\nGarden Ridge primarily relies on two cases from the Dallas Court of Appeals. See GPA Holding,\nInc. v. Baylor Health Care Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2546332\"><a href=\"/opinion/2546332/gpa-holding-v-baylor-health-care-sys/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App.-Dallas 2011, no pet.); Baker v.

Neither of these cases,\nhowever, supports Garden Ridge's position that the test is to be conducted solely on an ex ante\nbasis.\n\nIn GPA Holding, the appellate court found that GPA, a third-party administrator for self-funded\nhealth plans, did not meet its burden to establish that a “clause requiring payment of normal billed\ncharges [instead of the original provider discounted rates] after 45 days” in GPA's hospital services\nagreement with Baylor was an unenforceable penalty. 344 S.W.3d at 476. GPA did not prove that\n“the harm from late payment is [not] difficult to estimate, or that the normal billed charges were an\nunreasonable forecast of the loss actually sustained.” Id. (emphasis added). Nothing in the GPA\nHolding court's analysis precludes a consideration of reasonableness based on actual damages;\nand in fact, the court assessed Baylor's actual damages, i.e., whether the normal billed charges\nwere a “reasonable amount for the health care services and supplies provided in the charges at\nissue in this case.” Id.\n\nIn Baker, while the appellate court noted that evidence related to the difficulty of estimation and\nthe reasonableness of the damages forecast should be viewed as of the time the contract was\nexecuted, or the “anticipated harm” test, the court also expressly stated: “Additionally, liquidated\ndamages must not be disproportionate to actual damages. If the liquidated damages are shown to be\ndisproportionate to the actual damages, then the liquidated damages can be declared a penalty....”\n812 S.W.2d at 55. The Baker court called this the “actual harm” test: “The party asserting this\ndefense is required to prove the amount of the other party's actual damages, if any, to show that\nthe actual loss was not an approximation of the stipulated sum.” Id. This “actual harm” test is\nentirely consistent with what the Texas *440 Supreme Court stated in Phillips, that a party can\nshow unreasonableness based on “the actual damages incurred [being] much less than the amount\ncontracted for.” 820 S.W.2d at 788.\n\nThis court also has recognized that actual harm factors into the test to determine whether a\nliquidated-damages provision is an enforceable penalty. In Chan v.

If the\n            liquidated damages are shown to be disproportionate to the actual damages, then\n            the liquidated damages must be declared a penalty....\n\nId. at *3–4 (citations omitted).\n\nMost importantly, the UCC reasonableness test explicitly refers to actual harm, providing that\none way a liquidated-damages provision can be invalidated is where the stipulated amount proves\nunreasonable in light of “the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach.” TEX. BUS. &\nCOM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a) (emphasis added). In addition, the UCC expressly provides that\n“[a] term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.” Id.; see id. cmt.\n1. In order to determine whether a term fixes unreasonably large liquidated damages, it follows\nthat courts would need to consider what actual harm, if any, was caused by the breach and then\ncompare it to the stipulated amount of liquidated damages.\n\n [5] Thus, both the common law and the UCC allow for courts to determine the reasonableness\nof a liquidated-damages clause by considering whether the defendant has shown that the\nstipulated amount was “unreasonably large” compared to the actual damages. See TEX. BUS. &\nCOM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a); Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788.\n\n\n\n       c. Comparing the amount of the chargebacks to Garden Ridge's actual damages\n\n [6] Advance argues that it proved that the harm anticipated from its alleged noncompliance was\nnot difficult to estimate, that Garden Ridge did not even attempt to determine a chargeback amount\nthat was reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual harm, and that the liquidated damages\nGarden Ridge assessed are disproportionate to its actual damages. We conclude Advance met its\nburden to show that the chargeback amounts constituted a disproportionate estimation of Garden\nRidge's actual damages; therefore, the chargeback provisions are void as penalties under the UCC.\n\nAdvance elicited evidence from Garden Ridge employees Troy and Cole sufficient to prove that\nGarden Ridge suffered no actual damages as a result of Advance's substitution of the eight-\nfoot banner snowmen. The trial court also determined that Garden Ridge suffered no actual\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.              8\n\fGarden Ridge, L.P. v.

Advance also has shown that the additional chargebacks assessed\nby Garden Ridge for Advance's “short or incomplete order,” “carton markings,” and “cartons\nnot numbered correctly” noncompliance violations on other merchandise—totaling approximately\n$13,000—were unreasonably large when compared to Garden Ridge's actual damages of zero.\nTherefore, as a matter of law, we conclude that, under these circumstances, 4 the chargeback\namounts were unreasonable, and that the chargeback provisions are unenforceable as penalties\nunder the UCC because they fixed unreasonably large liquidated damages. Accordingly, we\noverrule Garden Ridge's first issue.\n\n\n\n                            d. Whether the amount of the chargebacks is\n                       reasonable in light of Garden Ridge's anticipated harm\n\n [7] Even if the concurring opinion is correct that Advance also had to prove the stipulated\ndamages were unreasonable in light of the anticipated harm in order for us to conclude that the\nchargeback provisions are unreasonable under section 2.718(a), we conclude that Advance has\ndone so in this case. As explained in subsection II.A.1.c., Advance has shown that the stipulated\namounts are unreasonable in light of the actual harm—zero—suffered by Garden Ridge. Further,\nAdvance has shown that the stipulated amounts are unreasonable in light of the harm anticipated\nby Garden Ridge.\n\nHere, according to the challenged liquidated-damages provisions, Garden Ridge anticipated at the\ntime of contract that an unauthorized substitution of any type would result in harm of 100% of the\ncost of the merchandise, plus freight. In fact, Garden Ridge's buyer Cole testified that Garden Ridge\nhad the discretion to assess the full 100% chargeback, even if the only deviation in the snowmen\nhad been green versus red buttons. Cole further testified that she was not aware of any instance\nwhere Garden Ridge had decided not to issue a chargeback because there was “no harm, no foul”\nor where Garden Ridge had exercised its discretion to not charge back “fully” for an unauthorized\nsubstitution. Garden Ridge's CFO Uhrig agreed that a button-color substitution would constitute\nnoncompliance, for which Garden Ridge could charge back the full 100% of merchandise cost.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Rep. Serv. 2d (West)</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\nIn other words, no matter what the degree of substitution, and no matter whether the substitution\nis even anticipated to result in any harm, Garden Ridge's unauthorized-substitution rule provides\nthat Garden Ridge keeps the merchandise without paying the vendor anything *442 and makes\nthe vendor cover the freight.\n\nEven though, according to Uhrig, Garden Ridge is “very good at estimating our costs,” he admitted\nthat at the time it was developing the chargeback schedule Garden Ridge did not perform any\nactual studies on what costs it would incur due to vendor noncompliance. Further, Uhrig could\nnot explain any specifics on how Garden Ridge “figure[d] out what the costs are and what would\nbe appropriate charge-backs.” Cole also testified that she was not aware of Garden Ridge having\nperformed any analysis as to whether the 100% chargeback amount reasonably approximates the\nanticipated harm that Garden Ridge would suffer from an unauthorized substitution. Despite this\nlack of detail regarding the 100% chargeback amount for anticipated harm from vendor violations,\nUhrig testified that “on average” charging back 100% somehow reflected Garden Ridge's costs for\nunauthorized substitutions. Uhrig further indicated that Garden Ridge's chargebacks communicate\nto vendors, “Don't do this”; and Garden Ridge's CEO, Tim Kibarian, agreed that chargebacks are\nthe “penalty” if its vendors do not follow its rules.\n\nWe therefore conclude that Advance has proven that Garden Ridge's liquidated-damages\nprovisions do not reasonably reflect Garden Ridge's anticipated harm for an unauthorized\nsubstitution, where the challenged provisions allowed Garden Ridge to charge back 100% of\nmerchandise cost plus freight for any unauthorized substitution, no matter how slight and no matter\nif Garden Ridge even anticipated incurring any harm.\n\n\nB. Instruction on damages\n [8] Garden Ridge next argues that the trial court committed reversible error by including the\nfollowing instruction as part of its question on Advance's damages:\n\n            The unauthorized substitution provision in the Vendor Compliance Manual is\n            unreasonable if the actual damages that Garden Ridge incurred were much less\n            than the charge-back amount.\n\nDuring the charge conference, Garden Ridge objected to the inclusion of this instruction as\nimproper because whether the chargeback provisions constitute penalties was a question reserved\nfor the court, not the jury. Garden Ridge further objected that the trial court should not include this\ninstruction because it would permit the jury to assess damages on a basis that is not permitted in\nthe law—that is, there is no actual-damages component to whether a liquidated damages provision\nis unreasonable and thus constitutes a penalty. 5 The trial court overruled Garden *443 Ridge's\nobjections, which properly are preserved for our review.

The complained-of\ninstruction here essentially tracks the language from Phillips—that a liquidated-damages provision\nis unreasonable and unenforceable as a penalty “because the actual damages incurred were much\nless than the amount contracted for.” See 820 S.W.2d at 788.

The trial thus abused its discretion by unnecessarily instructing\nthe jury on the reasonableness of Garden Ridge's chargebacks.\n\n [15] [16] Our review of the record reveals, however, that this abuse of discretion was harmless. 7\nIncluding a surplus instruction on the law is only harmful when it amounts to a comment on the\nweight of the evidence. Bean, 965 S.W.2d at 664 (discussing Acord, 669 S.W.2d at 113, 116).\nAlthough the trial court instructed jurors about a potential situation where Advance's damages may\nbe reduced to essentially nothing—that is, if Garden Ridge's chargebacks actually were reasonable\nand thus enforceable as a matter of law—including this instruction was not “reasonably calculated\nto cause [nor] probably did cause prejudicial harm to appellant[ ]” Garden Ridge. See Acord,\n669 S.W.2d at 116 (citation omitted). Moreover, by including this instruction, the trial court “did\nnot offer [its] opinion, assume the truth of a material fact, exaggerate, minimize, or withdraw\nrelevant evidence.” See Bean, 965 S.W.2d at 664. Therefore, including the surplus instruction did\nnot constitute a comment on the weight of the evidence.\n\nNor did including the improper instruction mislead or confuse the jury in its determination of\ndamages on Advance's breach-of-contract claim. Advance presented evidence relating to over\n$92,000 in chargebacks Garden Ridge assessed, and evidence that these chargebacks reflected\nwhat Garden Ridge deducted from Advance's merchandise invoices. The jury's answers to what\nwas “the difference between what Garden Ridge agreed to pay and what it actually paid for [the]\nsnowmen” reflect that the jury considered the contract rate as what Garden Ridge agreed to pay for\nthe nine-foot and eight-foot snowmen within PO #721 and PO #743, which included collection of\nfreight, and that Garden Ridge actually paid nothing whatsoever to Advance for these snowmen.\nThus, the jury found that for the snowmen Advance had proven its full amount of damages—that\nthe differences reflected the exact amounts Garden Ridge charged *445 back. The jury's answer\nto what was “the difference between what Garden Ridge agreed to pay and what it actually paid\nfor other items charged back on [Advance's] Exhibit” reflects that the jury considered the evidence\npresented on the remaining approximately $13,000 in chargebacks and determined that Advance\nhad proven damages on $500 of these other chargebacks. Therefore, the erroneous instruction did\nnot probably cause the rendition of an improper judgment; and we overrule Garden Ridge's second\nissue.\n\n\nC. Instructions on breach of contract\nIn its final issue, Garden Ridge argues that the trial court's inclusion of the UCC's definition\nregarding what constitutes the acceptance of goods—section 2.606(a) 8 —and the UCC's provision\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

During the charge conference, Garden Ridge objected\nto the inclusion of these instructions as unnecessary because Garden Ridge did not dispute that it\naccepted the goods. Garden Ridge thus contends that these “surplusage” instructions improperly\n“nudged” the jury toward Advance's theory of the case. The trial court overruled Garden Ridge's\nobjections, which properly are preserved for our review. See Thota, 366 S.W.3d at 689.\n\nThis is a UCC breach-of-contract case in which Advance pleaded, and presented evidence, that\nGarden Ridge breached by accepting and then not paying the contract price for the snowmen and\nother goods at issue. The parties do not dispute that their contracts are governed by the UCC.\nSection 2.606(a) and section 2.607(a), the sources of the trial court's instructions, are located\nin the UCC subchapter concerning “Breach, Repudiation, and Excuse.” Further, both of these\ninstructions properly state the law. TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.606(a) & 2.607(a) (West\n2009). These instructions thus are proper because they (1) assisted the jury in answering the breach\nquestion, (2) accurately stated the law, and (3) found support in the pleadings and evidence. See\nThota, 366 S.W.3d at 687 (citing Hawley, 284 S.W.3d at 855–56). We therefore conclude that the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by submitting the complained-of trial instructions.\n\n\n\n                                              III.

Under the plain meaning of\nSection 2.718(a), it was incumbent upon Advance to establish that the amount of damages set by\nthe provisions in question was not reasonable in light of the anticipated harm and the actual harm\ncaused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of\notherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. See TEX. BUS. & COMM.CODE ANN. § 2.718(a).\n\nBoth Section 2.718(a) and Texas common law provide that a liquidated-damages provision is\nenforceable as long as it is not a penalty. See id.; Phillips v. Phillips, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 788\n(Tex.1991) (discussing legal standard under Texas common law). But, to prove that a provision\nis a penalty under Texas common law, a party must prove that (1) the harm caused by the breach\nis not incapable or difficult of estimation, or (2) that the amount of liquidated damages called for\nis not a reasonable forecast of just compensation. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. The Supreme\nCourt of Texas has indicated that a party may prove that the amount of liquidated damages is not\na reasonable forecast of just compensation under the common-law test only by showing that the\nactual damages incurred were much less than the liquidated-damage amount. See id.\n\nAs can be seen by comparing the legal standard under Section 2.718(a) and the legal standard\nunder Texas common law, the two legal standards are significantly different.

Liquidated-damages provisions in\ncommercial transactions benefit both sides by providing certainty and predictability. By including\nSection 2–718(a) in Texas's version of the Uniform Commercial Code, the Texas Legislature\nrecognized the utility of liquidated-damages clauses and parties' willingness and desire to choose\nthis remedy in transactions involving the sale of goods. See Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. §\n2.718(a). The Legislature also recognized that in certain situations, liquidated-damages provisions\nshould not be enforceable, and the Legislature crafted a specific legal standard for making this\ndetermination. See id.\n\nWhen a buyer and a seller agree to a liquidated-damages provision, both parties have a potential\nupside and a potential downside. The idea is that, even though the non-breaching party's\nexpectation damages may be far greater than the amount specified in the liquidated-damages\nclause, the non-breaching party's recovery is capped at the amount of specified liquidated\ndamages. Under freedom-of-contract principles, courts must honor the parties' agreement unless\nthe stipulated amount is shown to be unreasonable under Section 2.718(a). See id. Under this\nstandard, as discussed above, the party asserting that the provision is void as a penalty must\nprove that the stipulated amount is unreasonable based both on the harm anticipated at the time of\ncontracting and the actual harm caused by the breach. At the *450 time of contracting, unknown\nfactors often make estimation and calculation of potential damages uncertain. 2 This uncertainty\nat the time of contracting is often what makes the determination of liquidated damages difficult.\nHindsight has a way of making estimations that were reasonable at the time seem unreasonable\nafter a breach. By the time a breach has occurred and the dispute has come to court, the costs and\nvaluations are often easier to estimate and, with hindsight, honest estimates made at the inception\nof the contract might prove to be too high or too low. This is part of the risk of doing business that\nparties embrace when agreeing to a liquidated-damages provision. In evaluating these provisions,\ncourts should not lose sight of important principles of freedom of contract and must uphold the\nsanctity of contract unless the liquidated-damages provision is shown to be a penalty under the\nstandard articulated by the Legislature in Section 2.718(a). See id.\n\nWith the legal standard adopted by the majority today, the court fails to honor the Legislature's\nintent of providing leeway for the parties to have stipulated to an amount of liquidated damages\nthat was reasonable under conditions prevailing at the time of contracting but that ends up not\nmeasuring damages in a completely accurate manner in a particular case. Enforcing liquidated-\ndamages provisions when they accurately gauge actual damages and not enforcing them when\nthey do not deprives the non-breaching party of the remedy it bargained to receive, contrary to\nSection 2.718(a).

With today's opinion\nfrom this court, there are now three different and conflicting views on this question from the three\nintermediate appellate courts that have addressed this issue.

If this\nissue is not addressed in the Supreme Court of Texas's opinion in the FPL Energy case, uniformity\nand predictability in the application of Section 2.718(a) would be served by high-court review of\nthis issue in this case or another.\n\n\n\n                                                             Conclusion\n\nThe majority's interpretation of Section 2.718(a) is more restrictive than the legal standard\nprovided by the Legislature under the plain meaning of that statute. But, because no error asserted\nby Garden Ridge probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment or probably prevented\nGarden Ridge from properly presenting this case on appeal, the trial court's judgment should be\naffirmed. Accordingly, *451 though I respectfully decline to join the majority opinion, I concur\nin the court's judgment.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.C.C.

Garden Ridge specifically objected to the inclusion of this particular instruction. The context of the charge\n       conference also reveals that although Garden Ridge requested and the trial court allowed an instruction paraphrasing the first sentence\n       of section 2.718(a) to indicate when liquidated damages were reasonable, Garden Ridge did not agree to the trial court's inclusion\n       of the instruction addressing reasonableness with regard to “actual damages” because that particular instruction, in contrast with the\n       previous instruction Garden Ridge requested and the court allowed, did not reflect a “legally permissible” basis for the jury to award\n       damages to Advance. Thus, Garden Ridge sufficiently made the trial court aware of its complaint that its actual incurred damages\n       should not be included in any reasonableness assessment by the jury of whether the chargebacks constituted penalties, and the trial\n       court overruled Garden Ridge's complaint.

Patrons who see an advertisement and come to the retail\n       merchant's store reasonably may expect to be able to purchase the item advertised. Garden Ridge testified that when the product is\n       not as advertised, the merchant suffers loss of customer goodwill.

BACKGROUND\n\nBaylor provides health care services to individual patients. Many of Baylor's patients are members\nof health plans. Baylor has many contracts with health benefit entities, including insurance\ncompanies and preferred provider organizations (PPOs), through which individual patients gain\naccess to Baylor's hospitals and services at discounted rates.\n\nPrivate Healthcare Systems, Inc. (PHCS) operates a network of PPOs. PHCS enters into contracts\nknown as preferred provider agreements with health care providers (such as Baylor) to negotiate\ndiscounts from the providers' full charges for health care services. PHCS also enters into contracts\nknown as subscriber services agreements with insurance companies, employer health plans,\nmanaged care organizations, and third-party administrators, to provide them and their members\naccess to health care services at the discounted rates established by the preferred provider\nagreements.\n\nGPA is a third-party administrator; its customers are self-funded health plans. Third-party\nadministrators provide claims handling services and administrative support to health plans. By\ncontracting with various PPO networks, such as PHCS, GPA also offers its customers—and their\nmembers—access to medical services from a network of providers (e.g. Baylor) at discounted\nrates.\n\nBaylor sued GPA for failure to pay for health care services Baylor provided to members of certain\nhealth care plans administered by GPA. GPA in turn filed a third-party action against PHCS.\nBoth Baylor and GPA moved for summary judgment; Baylor in fact filed several motions for\npartial summary judgment. The trial judge granted Baylor's motions and denied GPA's motion.\nThe parties then entered into an agreed final judgment and severance, by which GPA's third-\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

DISCUSSION\n\nA. The Contracts\nBaylor relies on three written contracts to establish its claim against GPA. First, Baylor\nrelies on a Subscriber Services Agreement between PHCS and GPA dated April 17, 1998,\namended by an Amendment, *472 Assignment, and Assumption of the Subscriber Services\nAgreement with effective dates of September 1, 2002 and January 1, 2003. Under the Subscriber\nServices Agreement, GPA 2 became a subscriber to PHCS's “comprehensive medical management\nsystem.” 3 As a subscriber to PHCS's network, GPA could offer its customers access to PHCS's\nnetwork of medical care providers at the discount rates negotiated by PHCS.\n\nSecond, Baylor relies on a Hospital Services Agreement (HSA) between Baylor and PHCS dated\nJanuary 1, 2002. Under the HSA, Baylor became a “Preferred Provider” in PHCS's network. It\nagreed to provide—at discounted rates 4 —health care services (“Covered Services”) to persons\n(“Members”) covered by “Health Plans” (including PPOs) created or sponsored by a “Payor” (a\ndefined term in the HSA). As part of the HSA, PHCS warranted that its contracts with each Payor\nobligate the “Payor (or its designee) to comply with the duties and obligations of [the HSA],\nincluding, but not limited to, paying for Covered Services rendered to Members in accordance\nwith the provisions of Article IV of [the HSA].”\n\nThird, Baylor relies on a Subscriber Acknowledgment between GPA and PHCS effective January\n1, 2003. The Subscriber Acknowledgment refers to both the Subscriber Services Agreement and\nthe HSA, reciting that GPA and PHCS have entered into the Subscriber Services Agreement and\nthat PHCS has entered into contracts with health care providers for participation in its network. The\nSubscriber Acknowledgment requires GPA “to pay or arrange to pay PHCS Preferred Providers\n[which would include Baylor] in accordance with the PHCS Preferred Provider Agreement for\nsuch Preferred Provider, for the markets and the networks for which [GPA] has purchased provider\nnetwork Services from PHCS.” (First brackets added.)\n\n\nB. Is GPA a “Payor”?\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    4\n\fGPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care System, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2546332\"><a href=\"/opinion/2546332/gpa-holding-v-baylor-health-care-sys/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011)\n\n\n\nIn its first issue, GPA contends the trial court erred in granting Baylor's motion for summary\njudgment because GPA is not a “payor” under the HSA. At the outset, GPA makes a procedural\nargument that summary judgment was improper because Baylor did not move for summary\njudgment on this issue. We disagree.\n\n *473 Baylor filed four motions for partial summary judgment. In its first motion, Baylor requested\nthat the trial court interpret the three contracts at issue and “find, as a matter of law, that GPA is\nbound by the terms and conditions of the HSA with respect to the health care claims at issue in this\ncase, including the requirements of Section 4.4(a).” In its own motion for summary judgment, GPA\nargued, “GPA is not a ‘Payor’ obligated to pay under the terms of the Baylor/PHCS Agreement,”\nand Baylor filed a summary judgment response again arguing that GPA was bound by the terms\nof the agreement.\n\n [11] The trial court granted Baylor's motion and denied GPA's, necessarily deciding that GPA\nwas a “Payor” bound by the provisions of the HSA, including section 4.4(a). We reject GPA's\nargument that the issue was not presented to and decided by the trial court.\n\nTurning to GPA's substantive argument, GPA asserts the HSA defines “Payor” very narrowly.\nIt argues the evidence established that GPA's clients—and not itself—were “Payors” under the\nHSA. It contends that as a third party administrator, it did not actually pay claims but only offered\nadministrative services to facilitate payment of claims by the employer-funded health plans that\nwere GPA's clients. Because the HSA's payment provisions apply only to “Payors” and GPA is\nnot a Payor, GPA contends it is not responsible to pay for Baylor's services, and thus that the trial\ncourt erred in entering summary judgment in favor of Baylor.\n\nThe HSA defines a “Payor” as\n\n            an insurance company, employer health plans, Taft–Hartley fund, plan sponsors\n            or other similarly situated entities or organizations which are obligated (directly\n            or through its designee) to pay for Covered Services for Members in accordance\n            with such Health Plans.\n\nGPA offered the affidavits of Kathy Enochs, the chief operating officer of GPA, and Madalyn\nStraughn, the vice president of operations for GPA, to establish that GPA is not an insurance\ncompany, employer health plan, Taft–Hartley fund, or plan sponsor. Enochs also testified that\nGPA was not a “payor” under the definition in the contract.\n\nGPA does not dispute it is a party to the Subscriber Services Agreement and the Subscriber\nAcknowledgment. In fact, Enochs testified GPA could not access PHCS's preferred providers at\na discount without the Subscriber Services Agreement and the Subscriber Acknowledgment.

In the Subscriber Acknowledgment, GPA\n“agrees to pay or arrange to pay PHCS Preferred Providers in accordance with the PHCS Preferred\nProvider Agreement for each such Preferred provider, for the markets and the networks for which\nSubscriber has purchased provider network Services from PHCS.”\n\nThe discounts offered to GPA's customers were the result of the relationships among the parties\nto all three agreements. If PHCS did not contract with Baylor under the HSA, there would be no\ndiscount to PHCS's subscribers on the fees for Baylor's services. If GPA did not in turn contract\nwith PHCS to take advantage of the discounts offered in the HSA, those *474 discounts would\nnot have been available to GPA's customers.\n\n [12] In Baylor University Medical Center v.

Epoch Group, 340 F.Supp.2d at 752. Discussing its conclusion that the three\ndocuments constituted a single, unified contract, the court reasoned:\n\n            Indeed, all three instruments were required to complete the relationship between\n            the parties. The Subscriber Services Agreement, which provided discounts from\n            PHCS to Payors, could not operate effectively without PHCS contracting with\n            providers through hospital services agreements. The very foundation of the\n            discounts offered in [the] Subscriber Services Agreement appears to be the\n            agreements between PHCS and providers such as Baylor. Moreover, Payor\n            Acknowledgments serve no apparent purpose other than to commit Payors to\n            comply with the terms and conditions of the provider agreements.\n\nId. at 755 (citation omitted).\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Perhaps because Epoch signed a document called “payor\nacknowledgment” instead of “subscriber acknowledgment,” the issue whether Epoch was a\n“payor” for purposes of the agreements was not presented to the Epoch Group court. Regardless\nof the titles of the two agreements, however, their substance was the same: to commit the payor or\nsubscriber “to comply with the terms and conditions of the provider agreements,” so that provider\ndiscounts set forth in hospital services agreements could be extended to the subscriber's customers.\nSee id. at 755.\n\n [13] We conclude, as did the trial court, that GPA is bound by the HSA. Reading the three\nagreements together, GPA committed to abide by the terms of the HSA and to pay or arrange to\npay Baylor in accordance with the HSA. Even though the summary judgment evidence showed\nthat GPA was not an “insurance company, employer health plan[ ], Taft–Hartley fund, [or] plan\nsponsor[ ],” we conclude the evidence (i.e. the three contracts) proves as a matter of law that\nGPA falls within the contractual definition of “other similarly situated entities or organizations\nwhich are obligated (directly or through its designee) to pay for Covered Services for Members in\naccordance with such Health Plans.” We overrule GPA's first issue.\n\n\nB. “Liquidated Damages” or “Penalty”?\nThe HSA also contains terms regarding payment of claims:\n\n  4.4 Claim Processing\n\n  (a) Payor (or its designee) shall pay all Clean Claims for Covered Services *475 within forty-\n     five (45) calendar days of receipt of a Clean Claim containing the information set out in\n     Section 4.3 from Hospital in accordance with the applicable reimbursement rates attached on\n     Schedule 1. ... If Payor (directly or through its designee) does not pay within forty-five (45)\n     days of receipt of a Clean Claim, Payor shall no longer be eligible for the rates set forth on\n     Schedule 1 and shall be obligated to pay Hospital at Hospital's Normal Billed Charges and\n     hospital may elect to terminate this Agreement....\n\nIn its second issue, GPA contends the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary\njudgment because the amount of damages awarded against it under this provision constituted an\nunenforceable liquidated damages penalty.\n\nGPA complains that the above section, by requiring payors to pay the hospital's “Normal Billed\nCharges” unless the payor pays a Clean Claim within 45 days, “fixes compensation for breach in\nadvance of the breach,” and is thus an impermissible penalty.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The\npolicy underlying the prohibition against penalties is to ensure that a party to a contract receives\n“just compensation,” that is, “neither more nor less than his actual damages.” Phillips, 820 S.W.2d\nat 788 (quoting Stewart v.

Baylor\nasserts that section 4.4 “does not fix in advance compensation for GPA's failure to perform,”\nbut rather “provides a two-tiered pricing structure that grants GPA discounts (often substantial)\nif claims are paid within forty-five days.” Baylor further contends that even if section 4.4 is a\nliquidated damages provision, it is enforceable under Texas law and is not a penalty because\ndamages are difficult or impossible to estimate, and Baylor's normal billed charge is a reasonable\nforecast of just compensation.\n\nFor purposes of this opinion, we will assume without deciding that section 4.4(a) of the HSA is\na liquidated damages provision, and examine whether the clause is also an unenforceable penalty\nunder the factors set forth in Phillips.\n\n [18] [19] The party asserting that a liquidated damages clause is an unenforceable penalty (here,\nGPA) bears the burden of proof.

In support of its motion for summary judgment, GPA offered evidence comparing\nthe discounted rates to the hospital's normal billed rates for the charges at issue. GPA offered a\nchart attached to the affidavit of Madalyn Straughn that showed the percentage difference between\nthe discounted rate and the normal billed charge for each of the charges at issue. GPA notes “the\noverwhelming majority of the percentage charges are 33% or more.”\n\nIn response to GPA's motion for summary judgment, Baylor offered evidence regarding the\ndifficulty of estimation and the reasonableness of the charges. Baylor offered the affidavit of Janda\nEdwards to explain that Baylor's normal billed charge “is the amount Baylor charges for services\nand supplies to entities or individuals who do not have access to a discount through a contract with\nBaylor.” Edwards explained Baylor's normal billed charge “is established by each facility and is\nbased upon an analysis of many factors including the service provided, the amount of personnel\ntime needed to provide the service, the amount of capital equipment needed to provide the service,\nthe amount of routine equipment needed to provide the service, the overhead, and market value.”\nEdwards also testified that Baylor's normal billed charge is a reasonable amount for the health care\nservices and supplies provided in the charges at issue in this case.\n\n [20] [21] GPA quotes from Edwards's affidavit and argues, “Baylor offered no justification\nattempting to show how the changed billing rate was a reasonable estimate of the cost associated\nwith payments being untimely.” GPA posits that a “more reasonable” calculation would be “a $30\nservice fee and 18% annual interest,” and argues, “our society routinely deals with late payments\nby a modest service fee and interest, and thus Baylor's damages were calculable.” GPA does\nnot offer evidence to support these arguments, however. The difficulty (or lack of difficulty) in\nestimation as well as the unreasonableness of the damages estimate were GPA's to prove. Urban\nTelevision Network Corp., 277 S.W.3d at 919. General statements about a “more reasonable” or\n“modest” rate are not evidence that the harm from late payment is difficult to estimate, or that the\nnormal billed charges were an unreasonable forecast of the loss actually sustained. See Phillips,\n820 S.W.2d at 788. GPA also emphasized that Baylor itself referred to the normal billed charge as\na “penalty.” The substance of the provision controls, however.

Bellos, M.D.,\nP.A. and enforced a contractual liquidated damages clause against Healix Infusion Therapy, Inc.\nThe trial court awarded Dr. Bellos $10,000.00 in his suit against Healix. The trial court also\nawarded attorney's fees to Dr. Bellos. In two issues on appeal, Healix argues that the liquidated\ndamages clause is an unenforceable penalty and that there are genuine issues of material fact\nregarding damages. 1 We affirm.\n\nDr. Bellos sued Healix in another lawsuit; the parties reached a settlement in that suit. Both\nparties agreed not to disclose the nature of the settlement agreement. The agreement provided for\n$10,000.00 in liquidated damages in the event of a breach by either party. After the settlement\nagreement was signed, Methodist Hospitals of Dallas (Methodist), where Dr. Bellos practiced,\nsent $6,385.13, which it owed to Dr. Bellos, because it mistakenly believed that Healix held a lien\nagainst Dr. Bellos. Healix sent a letter and a copy of the settlement agreement to Methodist to show\nthat there was no lien. Dr. Bellos claimed that Healix breached the settlement agreement when\nHealix furnished the agreement to Methodist, and he sued Healix to recover under the liquidated\ndamages provision of the agreement.\n\nA trial court must grant a motion for summary judgment if the moving party establishes that no\ngenuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.

Phillips v. Phillips, supra.\n\n *2 In this case, the initial burden was on the movant. However, when a party raises the affirmative\ndefense of penalty, that party assumes the burden to conclusively establish the defense. Baker v.\nInternational Record Syndicate, Inc., supra.Therefore, the burden was upon Healix to prove that\nthe contractual liquidated damages was an unenforceable penalty.\n\nThe settlement agreement offered as summary judgment evidence by Dr. Bellos showed that the\nparties agreed to keep the nature of the settlement agreement confidential. The parties further\nagreed that a breach of the confidentiality clause would result in imminent and irreparable harm\nand that the damages for a breach of confidentiality would be $10,000.00. Healix admitted in its\nresponse to Dr. Bellos's request for admissions that it agreed to the confidentiality of the agreement\nand that it agreed to the $10,000.00 liquidated damages clause. Dr. Bellos's affidavit reflected that\nhe agreed to the confidential nature of the agreement and that he had performed all acts required of\nhim under the settlement agreement. His affidavit further showed that Methodist subjected him to\na re-credentialing process every two years. He was unaware of how the disclosure of the agreement\nwould affect the re-credentialing process, but states that he has been harmed in a manner that is\n“incapable of or difficult of estimation.”\n\nAs part of its proof, Healix attached the affidavit of Heather Hughes–Glass, the corporate risk\nmanager for Healix. In her affidavit, Heather Hughes–Glass stated that, as soon as she became\naware of the confidentiality provision of the agreement that was sent to Methodist, she contacted\nDean Matthys, the corporate risk manager for Methodist, to have him destroy the agreement. She\nfurther stated that Matthys indicated that only he and his assistant were aware of the settlement\nagreement. Also included in the summary judgment evidence was an affidavit given by Matthys as\nwell as a letter from Matthys to Healix. These documents indicated that the copy of the settlement\nagreement was destroyed soon after it was received by Methodist and that the only two people to\nsee the agreement, Matthys and his assistant Lisa Irby, were not involved with the re-credentialing\nprocess at Methodist. Finally, Healix offered as summary judgment evidence Dr. Bellos's response\nto a request for disclosure that any economic damages suffered by Dr. Bellos were difficult to\nestimate.\n\nThis evidence does not meet the burden Healix must bear: that at the time the agreement was made\ndamages could be easily ascertained and that the amount of the liquidated damages award was not\na reasonable forecast of just compensation. Healix contends that the award of liquidated damages\nis disproportionate to the actual damages suffered by Dr. Bellos because Dr. Bellos did not have\nany actual damages. To emphasize this point, Healix relies on Baker.“If the liquidated damages are\nshown to be disproportionate to the actual damages, then the liquidated damages can be declared a\npenalty and recovery limited to actual damages proven.”Baker v.

To prove this defense, Healix must prove\nactual damages, if any, to show that the actual loss was not an approximation of the stipulated\nsum.Baker v. International Record Syndicate, Inc., supra.That damages are not yet ascertainable\nis not tantamount to evidence of “zero” damages.\n\n *3 The summary judgment evidence establishes that there was an agreement between Healix and\nDr. Bellos that prohibited the disclosure of the nature of the settlement agreement and that Dr.\nBellos performed all the required acts under the agreement. Healix breached the agreement by\nsending a copy of the agreement to Methodist. Because we find that Healix failed to meet its burden\nof proof on the penalty issue and because Healix failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact,\nwe hold that the trial court did not err when it granted Dr. Bellos's motion for summary judgment.\nHealix's issues on appeal are overruled.\n\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The award of attorney's fees is not contested in this appeal.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hill, Sr., a prominent oil and gas businessman, who\ndied shortly after this litigation began. He was survived by his wife, Margaret Hunt Hill, who\nwas named a defendant, individually and as Executrix and Trustee of her husband's estate. Also\nnamed in the suit were the trusts of the Hills' seven grandchildren and their daughter, Lyda Hill.\nThey comprise, together with two closely held family corporations, Seven Falls Company and U.S.\nFinancial Corporation, what will be referred to as the “Hill Group.” The other family includes the\nbrothers, Sherman and Stuart Hunt, and their closely held corporation, the Kickham Group, Inc.,\nand two Hunt daughters, Hara and Hilre. They are collectively referred to as the “Hunt Group.”\nThe Appellants as a whole will be referred to as “Hunt/Hill.”\n\n\nB. The Dispute.\nIn the early 1980s, Heritage acquired oil and gas leases in several sections of the *102 Crittendon\nField in Winkler County, Texas. Heritage sold substantial, partial interests in these leases to A.G.\nHill, Tribal Drilling (a Hunt family partnership), and the Hunt brothers individually. In November\n1984, Heritage, as the Operator, entered into a Joint Operating Agreement (“22 J.O.A.”) for\nSection 22 of the Crittendon Field with Tribal Drilling Company and A.G. Hill and a number of\nother smaller working interest owners, using A.A.P.L. Form 610–1982 Model Form Operating\nAgreement. The contract area defined by Exhibit “A” of the 22 J.O.A. was for all of Section\n22 “[t]o a depth of 20,000' or to a depth sufficient to thoroughly test the Fusselman formation,\nwhichever is the lesser depth.”\n\nFrom our review of the 14,000 plus page record, we have distilled the facts of the case to the\nfollowing narrative chronology beginning in 1985:\n\n\n1985\n\n         October 23 A Joint Operating Agreement for the adjacent Section 21 was entered\n           into by essentially the same parties as the 22 J.O.A.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The letter acknowledged that Sherman and Stuart Hunt agreed to pay 37.5 percent of\n  all costs attributable to the 22–2 well and 18.75 percent of all costs attributable to any subsequent\n  wells drilled in Section 22 pursuant to their letter of agreement with Heritage dated November\n  18, 1986.\n\nMay As drilling on the 22–2 well neared 19,000 feet, the operations became more tenuous. Hunt/\n Hill requested that the 22–2 well's drilling cease and that the well be put into production, but\n Heritage continued the drilling.\n\nMay 10 Heritage and Oxford Oil and Gas, Inc. “Oxford” entered into a letter of agreement whereby\n Oxford agreed to pay 64.5 percent of the drilling costs of the 22–3 well in exchange for an\n assignment of a 33.333334 percent working interest in the 22–3 well. Oxford had the option\n to quit paying at any time and to receive a proportionately reduced interest once the well was\n completed. The agreement was expressly subject to the terms of the 22 J.O.A.

Production pressure tests indicated a potential Texas record for gas reserves.\n\nJune 30 Heritage issued an AFE proposal for the new or substitute well—the 22–3. The AFE\n  was for a new location and a depth of 22,000 feet or a depth sufficient to test the Ellenburger\n  formation, whichever was less. Hills and Hunts did not respond to the AFE. The Hunts began an\n  analysis of their investment in the Crittendon Field and began negotiations with Lyco Energy\n  Corp. to sell their entire interest in the Crittendon Field.\n\nSeptember 25 The Hunt Brothers secretly recorded a conversation with Michael Wisenbaker. The\n  Hunts told Wisenbaker that: (1) they were not contemplating the sale of their interests in the\n  Crittendon Field; (2) they wanted a Joint Operating Committee to oversee Crittendon Operations\n  with J.R. Latimer as Operator for the committee; (3) they wanted to stop all drilling activities in\n  Section 22; and (4) they had the requisite votes to remove Heritage as Operator and would do so\n  unless Wisenbaker agreed with the Hunts. They were informed that Heritage was in negotiations\n  with Enserch Gas Company and Lone Star Gas Company “Enserch/Lone Star” for prepayment\n  gas contracts, and that Heritage was going forward with the 22–3 well and would not resign\n  as Operator.\n\nSeptember 25 Heritage sent the working interest owners an Ellenburger AFE for the proposed 22–\n  3 well. The AFE proposed a total depth of 22,000' or to a depth sufficient to test the Ellenburger\n  formation whichever was shallower.\n\nSeptember 27 Tribal Drilling notified Heritage that it is opposed to the 22–3 well.\n\nSeptember 28 The Hunts notified Heritage that a “vote” of the Non–Operators had been taken,\n  and that a majority voted to remove Heritage for “failure and/or refusal to carry out its duties\n  as Operator” of Sections 21, 22, and 23, but that there was not a majority voting for removal\n  with respect to the other two wells. The letter stated that Tribal Drilling would take over\n  operations and that Heritage should only perform “routine and necessary production, operating,\n  and maintenance operations” until Tribal Drilling took over. Wisenbaker telephoned Sherman\n  Hunt and told him that Heritage will not resign as the Operator.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Heritage confirmed that\n  the proposed 22–3 well's formation objective was the Ellenburger. The Hunts objected to the\n  drilling of the 22–3 well on the basis that Heritage was “selling out” and the working interest\n  owners would not know “who they are going to be in bed with.”\n\nNovember 10 Hill signed an Ellenburger AFE for the 22–3 well, conditioned upon: (1) the 22\n  J.O.A. be amended to 22,000 feet; (2) Hill retain an option of waiting until the well reached\n  the Woodford Shale before deciding to go “consent” to the Ellenburger; (3) costs be billed\n  in accordance with a revised ownership schedule; and (4) all working interest owners received\n  title opinion in time to review prior to spudding the 22–3 well.\n\n      Gregg Ewing of A.G. Hill Oil Producer sent a letter to Heritage. The letter stated that pursuant\n      to the October 26, *104 1987 meeting, A.G. Hill reviewed the AFE dated September 25,\n      1987, for the 22–3 well and determined that the proposed 22–3 well is outside the contract\n      area of the Section 22 J.O.A. Ewing advised Heritage that the J.O.A. must be amended to\n      cover the 22–3 well and that A.G.

Attorneys for the Hunts\n  sent Heritage a letter stating: (1) the 22–3 well is a proposed operation outside the “contract\n  area” of the J.O.A.; (2) the J.O.A. does not govern operations outside the “contract area;” (3)\n  the Hunts demand a full and complete accounting for all costs and revenues attributable to the\n  22–3 well; (4) Heritage and the Hunts are tenants-in-common as to the 22–3 well; and (5) if it\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The\n  letter further stated that the Hunts rejected the proposed assignment of interest that Heritage\n  delivered on November 23, 1987.\n\nDecember 9 Mike Wisenbaker met with A.G. Hill, Jr. at the latter's offices. Hill advised\n  Wisenbaker that if he attempted to drill the 22–3 well, that Hunt/Hill would claim that Heritage\n  was a bad faith trespasser and seize all gas production should the well be successful. Mike\n  Wisenbaker alleged that Hill warned that Heritage would be “squashed ... like a bug” if he did\n  not accept a new Operator.\n\nDecember 10 Virgil St. Clair sent Heritage a letter on behalf of the Hills stating that they had\n  “discovered that Heritage does not have a working interest” in Section 22, which is a deemed\n  resignation of operatorship under the terms of the 22 J.O.A. The letter further stated that Hill\n  was nominating Tribal Drilling to assume operatorship and they would poll the other working-\n  interest owners.

Tribal Drilling sought a declaratory judgment\n  that Heritage had no interest in the field and a temporary restraining order to cease Heritage's\n  operations and turn them over to Tribal Drilling. Three hours later Heritage filed this instant\n  suit in Winkler County alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2) slander of title; (3) cloud on title;\n  (4) tortious interference with contract; (5) tortious interference with business relations; and (6)\n  intentional/negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n\nDecember 18 Wisenbaker and Wisenbaker Production Company transferred their interests in\n  Section 22 to Heritage.\n\nDecember 23 Hunt lawyers sent a letter to Heritage lodging objections to 22–3 well.\n\nDecember 28 Heritage began drilling the 22–3 well.\n\n1988\n\nJanuary 29 Hunt lawyers sent a letter to Heritage that they had opinion that the 22–2 well had been\n  drilled to depth sufficient to test the Fusselman formation.

The Hills' motivation is less clear, though it seems more focused\non their concerns with the conduct of field operations by Heritage. Nonetheless, the essential\nfacts of this case are largely undisputed and relatively uncomplicated. These facts, however, are\nenveloped within the mass and maze of a record typical of oil and gas cases, and groaning further\nfrom the Byzantine nature of joint operating agreements. Not surprisingly, the author has spent\nmany months wandering in strange and mostly wrong valleys searching for the answers to the\nimponderables presented in this case.\n\nBasically, this is a case where the Joint Operating Agreement Operator has alleged commercial\nand tort causes of action arising as a consequence of the actions of Non–Operators in attempting\nto remove him as the Operator and to prevent subsequent well operations. These causes of action\ninclude tortious interference, slander of title, and fraud. On the other side, the Hunt/Hill's claim\nthat Heritage breached the Joint Operating Agreement (“J.O.A.”) and was not legally qualified to\nserve as the Operator under the J.O.A. The jury generally found for Heritage and rejected all of\nHunt/Hill's claims.\n\nHeritage, recovered under three theories of tort liability: (1) tortious interference with contract\nand business relationship; (2) slander of title; and (3) fraud. Each of these causes of action were\npremised upon essentially six distinct actions alleged and proven. These were:\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hunt/Hill also claim that Heritage did not submit breach of contract\nto the jury; however, we immediately disagree with that claim. In response to jury Question 8, the\njury found that the 22–3 well was covered by the 22 J.O.A. Further, in response to jury Question\n11, the jury found that Hunt/Hill's failure to comply with the 22 J.O.A. was not excused. Thus,\nwe find that jury implicitly found that Hunt/Hill breached the 22 J.O.A. This finding does not,\nhowever, extinguish Hunt/Hill's complaint.\n\n [2] [3] Hunt/Hill has broadly argued that Heritage's claims only sound in contract and not in\ntort. On the other side of this looking glass, Heritage counters just as broadly that this is simply\na tort case. Justice Larsen has noted that the “law of ‘contorts' is a muddy area, devoid of bright\nline rules or easy answers as to what conduct constitutes a tort, and what a breach of contract.

To recover for tortious interference with an existing contract, a plaintiff must\nprove: (1) the existence of a contract subject to interference; (2) a willful and intentional act of\ninterference; (3) that the act was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's damage; and (4) that actual\ndamage or loss occurred.

The basic and stated purpose of these operating agreements is for the exploration and\ndevelopment of designated oil and gas within the prescribed geographical area described in Exhibit\n“A” to the J.O.A. A single party is appointed “operator” who is responsible for the management\nand control of drilling, development, and production activities. The parties agree to share the costs\nand liabilities, to own equipment, and to share in production in proportion to their respective\npercentage of ownership and burdens, which is also set out in Exhibit “A” of the J.O.A.\n\nThe drilling of an initial well on the contract area is the only operation mandated in which all\nthe parties must participate. After the initial well, any party may propose subsequent drilling\noperations, but such operations must be conducted by mutual consent of all the parties or pursuant\nto the consent/non-consent provisions. A.A.P.L. Form 610, 1982, Art. VI, B. Notice of a proposal\ntriggers the consent/non-consent provisions for subsequent drilling operations. Those parties who\ndecline to participate are “non-consenting parties.” Those who agree to participate are consenting\nand bear all costs and risks of that operation. A consenting party may opt to limit its participation\nto its original working interest or to “carry its proportionate part of Non–Consenting Parties'\ninterests....”\n\nWhen the operations begin, the non-consenting parties are deemed to have relinquished all interest\nin the well, operating rights, and production until the carrying parties are reimbursed for 100\npercent of what would have been the non-consenting party's share of the operating costs and\nsurface equipment and a substantial risk penalty, a multiple (500 percent in this case) of most other\ncosts carried. A.A.P.L. Form 610, 1982, Art. VI, B(2).\n\nTypically, any party desiring to drill a subsequent well or to rework, deepen, or plug back a\nnonproducing well is required to give written notice to each participant, specifying the operation\nproposed, the location, objective depth and formation, and the estimated cost. Upon receipt of the\nnotice, the election to participate must be exercised within a specified period of time. The failure\nto respond is deemed a negative election. A.A.P.L. Form 610, 1982, Art. VI, B(1).\n\nAn election to participate applies to the full extent of a party's interest. However, a party may\nincrease its participation by assuming responsibility for a non-consenting party's interest. If less\nthan all parties elect to participate, the proposing party must inform all the consenting parties of\nthe total *111 interest committed to the project. Each party that elects to participate may then\nfurther elect to limit its participation to its original interest or to carry its proportionate part of\nthe non-consenting parties' interests in addition to its original interest. Despite a non-consenting\nparty's relinquishment of control and share in the subsequent operation, the non-consenting party\nremains a party in the overall venture and continues to have a substantial degree of control even\nover the project in which it is not participating. The non-consent party retains the right of access\nto all portions of the contract area. Most significant to this case, the non-consent party continues\nto have voting rights in the removal and appointment of the operator, which provides a forum for\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See American Nat'l Petroleum Co., 798 S.W.2d at 278 (breach of one's own contract, while\nonly giving rise to contract claims as regards to that contract, can also constitute claim in tort for\ntortious interference with the contract of a third party). As noted above, the Texas Supreme Court\nrecently reaffirmed, at least conceptually, that concept, holding that “tort damages are recoverable\nfor a fraudulent inducement claim irrespective of whether the fraudulent representations are later\nsubsumed in a contract or whether the plaintiff only suffers an economic loss related to the subject\nmatter of the contract.” Formosa Plastics Corp. USA, 41 Tex.Sup.Ct.J. at 293, 960 S.W.2d at 44.\n\nFurthermore, we are not dealing with an ordinary contract. Joint Operating Agreements,\nstandardized forms developed over years by the industry to govern ventures in the development of\noil and gas properties, are simply not everyday fixtures of life. They govern operations involving\nimmense financial risk and reward; the parties to J.O.A. are experienced and sophisticated and\ngenerally have balanced bargaining positions. These are agreements which involve liabilities and\nobligations unique to the legal and technical peculiarities of the oil and gas industry. Nevertheless,\nthis case highlights that they are still basic structures with minimal safeguards and protections\nfrom the misconduct of a party.\n\nWe conclude the pleadings and jury submissions sufficiently distinguish independent claims of\nbreach of contract and tort causes of action. The specific facts forming the basis for breach of\ncontract establish at least some degree of independence from the facts forming the basis for the\ntortious interference, slander of title, and fraud. The tort causes of action pled and proven by\nHeritage were independent of the 22 J.O.A. Rather, the contracts or business relationships alleged\nby Heritage relate to the non-consent interests Heritage sought to sell to third parties, the gas\npurchase agreements, and Heritage's attempt to sell its entire Crittendon interests which are clearly\nindependent of the obligations and duties imposed under the 22 J.O.A.

A.A.P.L. Form 610, 1982, Art. VI, B.\n\nHeritage claims that it properly proposed the development of the 22–3 well under the terms of the\n22 J.O.A., and because Hunt/Hill elected not to participate in the 22–3 well operation, Heritage\ncarried the 22–3 well non-consenting interests of Hunt/Hill. In Question 8 of the trial court's\ncharge, the jury found that the 22–3 well was covered by the 22 J.O.A. It is, however, clear from\nthe record and undisputed that the 22–3 well was proposed, engineered, and drilled to a target\ndepth of 22,000 feet or the Ellenburger formation. Thus, the first problem with the jury's verdict\nis that the 22 J.O.A. on its face does not cover the 22–3 well. Exhibit “A” of the 22 J.O.A. reads,\nin pertinent part:\n\n   1. LANDS SUBJECT TO THIS AGREEMENT:\n\n      All of Section 22, Block C–23, PSL Survey, Winkler County, Texas\n\n   2. RESTRICTIONS AS TO DEPTHS OR FORMATIONS:\n\n      To a depth of 20,000' or to a depth sufficient to thoroughly test the Fusselman formation,\n      whichever is the lesser depth.\n\nIn the face of this contradiction, Heritage makes two alternative arguments. First, that whether or\nnot the J.O.A. covers a well is determined at the time the well is proposed and not after the well has\nalready been drilled. Secondly, the J.O.A. parties modified the depth restrictions of the 22 J.O.A.\nto cover the deeper depths to which they actually drilled the 22–3 well.\n\n [13] We find their first argument that the actual depth or formation to which a well is drilled is\nimmaterial so long as the depth and formation initially proposed were within the “contract area,”\nunpersuasive, either as a general proposition or as applied to this case. The argument is especially\nflawed as for drilling operations that go beyond or deeper than the limitations defined by the J.O.A.\nIt also trivializes the import of the defined contract area and subjects the non-operators to the whim\nof the operator. Cf. Hamilton v. Texas Oil & Gas Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2407895\"><a href=\"/opinion/2407895/hamilton-v-texas-oil-gas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 323–24 (Tex.App.—\nEl Paso 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Conversely, it makes almost no sense to require or to allow an\noperator to drill deeper than is necessary to bring a well into proper production. In other words,\nthe depth and formation expressed in the J.O.A. define the outer or maximum boundaries covered\nby a J.O.A. and not minimum mandatory objectives. We therefore reject Heritage's first argument.\n\n [14] [15] It is axiomatic that a J.O.A. contract and specifically the contract areas may be\ncontractually amended, and Heritage's alternative argument is that the 22 J.O.A. was modified\nto authorize drilling the 22–3 well to the actual completion depth of 22,000 feet.

One\nparty alone cannot modify a contract after it has been entered into and all parties to the agreement\nmust assent to the modification for the modification to be valid. Mandril, 620 S.W.2d at 244.\n\nThe 22 J.O.A. was entered into by sixteen entities, besides Heritage. Accordingly, any\nmodification of the contract would require the mutual assent of all the parties. It is clear from\nthe record that the parties contemplated a modification of the contract area. Indeed, the attempted\nmodification of the 22 J.O.A. contract area did not begin with the 22–3 well, but rather with the 22–\n2 well. Consequently, we must consider two instances in order to decide if there was, as Heritage\nargues, a valid modification to the 22 J.O.A. to extend the contract area deeper: (1) the issuance and\nexecution of AFEs on the 22–2 well; and (2) the issuance and execution of AFEs on the 22–3 well.\n\n\n1. The 22–2 Well.\n [16] The undisputed evidence shows that all the working interest owners, except the Hills and\nTribal Drilling Company, signed an Ellenburger AFE for the 22–2 well. This contemplated and\nauthorized drilling beyond 20,000 feet and the shallower Fusselman formation. The undisputed\nevidence shows, however, that the Ellenburger AFE was accompanied by a cover letter from\nHeritage to the working interest owners that stated, that despite the language in the AFE, Heritage\nonly intended to drill to a depth sufficient to test the Fusselman formation, or to 20,000 feet,\nwhichever was less. Hunt/Hill objected and demanded a Fusselman AFE for the 22–2 well.\n\nConsequently, as a matter of law, a modification of the 22 J.O.A. could not have occurred via the\n22–2 well Ellenburger AFE. As evidenced by Heritage's cover letter, there is legally no evidence\nof a meeting of the minds between Heritage and the other working interest owners. Moreover,\nthere is no evidence of a clear intent on behalf of the parties to modify the J.O.A. Indeed, formal\nmodification of the 22 J.O.A. was never expressly addressed or requested. Finally, because of the\nconflicting language of the accompanying cover letter, we do not find any intent by implication\nthat the signing of the Ellenburger AFE by the working interest owners would modify the 22 J.O.A.\n\nThe Hunts and Tribal Drilling's refusal to sign an Ellenburger AFE for the 22–2 well, and their\ndemand for and execution of a Fusselman AFE clearly negates any finding of a modification of\nthe 22 J.O.A. because of the 22–2 well operations.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The 22–3 Well.\n [17] On May 19, 1987, Heritage encountered problems in the drilling of the 22–2 well. Heritage\nalleged that it halted drilling on the 22–2 well, which was well short of the target depth in exchange\nfor Hunt/Hill's oral promise to pay their share of the costs for a substitute well, the 22–3 well.\nBoth Heritage and Hunt/Hill understood that the 22–3 well was to be drilled to a depth of 22,000\nfeet, or a depth sufficient to test the Ellenburger formation. No part of that agreement was ever\nput into writing and no evidence was offered of the essential terms of the agreement. Once it\nhad the oral agreement with Hunt/Hill to stop drilling on the 22–2 well, Heritage polled the other\ninterest owners to secure unanimous consent of all working interest owners to stop short the drilling\noperations on the 22–2 well.\n\nHeritage then issued three AFEs in series for the 22–3 well. The first AFE issued on June 30,\n1987, proposed drilling to a depth of 22,000 feet. The second AFE issued on October 14, 1987,\nproposed a different location and a depth of 22,000 feet. The third AFE issued on December 1,\n1987, proposed the same location as the June AFE but proposed drilling only to a depth of 20,000\nfeet.\n\nHeritage has not cited, and we have not found any evidence that any one of these AFEs was\nexecuted by all the working interest owners. There is evidence that the Hills, in a letter to Heritage,\nconditionally agreed to the drilling of the 22–3 well to a depth of 22,000 feet upon the occurrence\nof several conditions, two of which included that Heritage *115 formally amend the 22 J.O.A.\nto cover the proposed drilling depth and that Heritage secure a title opinion on the drill site in\naccordance with the 22 J.O.A. The evidence reflects that Heritage tried but failed to secure the\nother Non–Operators' consent to amend the Section 22 J.O.A. to eliminate the depth restrictions.\nWe simply fail to see how Heritage can now hold Hunt/Hill liable under the unmodified contract.\nCentex Corp. v.

Tortious Interference with a Contract/Prospective Business Relationship.\n [18] Because the 22 J.O.A. did not govern the 22–3 well, there was no obligation by any of\nthe working interest owners to make a consent or non-consent election when the 22–3 well was\nproposed by Heritage. Consequently, there were no non-consent interests in the 22–3 well for\nHeritage to carry or be able to sell. Nonetheless, the jury found that Heritage had both an agreement\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  22\n\fHill v.

The original petition alleged\nvarious breaches of the J.O.A., interference with actual and prospective business relationships, and\ncloud of title. The petition contained a brief statement of facts pertaining to Hunt/Hill's challenge\nof Heritage's status as Operator under the Section 22 J.O.A. and how those actions constituted a\nbreach of the 22 J.O.A. Heritage filed its First Amended Petition on May 1, 1992, adding a number\nof new plaintiffs and new defendants.

Non–Consent Interests.\n [31] Hunt/Hill complain that the evidence shows that Heritage did not attempt to sell *118 the\nnon-consent interests in the 22–3 well until May 1988 and that the efforts to sell those interests\nhad failed by June 1988. Since these claims were not specifically asserted until Heritage filed its\nFirst Amended Petition on May 1, 1992, Hunt/Hill argue that they are barred by limitations. We\nfind, however, that Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code § 16.068 governs the application of\nthe statute of limitations in situations such as this. It provides:\n\n            If a filed pleading relates to a cause of action, cross action, counterclaim, or\n            defense that is not subject to a plea of limitation when the pleading is filed,\n            a subsequent amendment or supplement to the pleading that changes the facts\n            or grounds of liability or defense is not subject to a plea of limitation unless\n            the amendment or supplement is wholly based on a new, distinct, or different\n            transaction or occurrence.

The amended claim simply does not allege a wholly new,\ndistinct, or different transaction. Both the earlier and later claims involve the 22 J.O.A. and the\nparties to that operating agreement. Non-consent interests are an integral feature of Joint Operating\nAgreements, and critical to this point, they are the core of this litigation.\n\nConsequently, even though Heritage's attempts to sell the non-consent interests may have occurred\nafter the filing of the original petition, the causes of action involving those interests do not arise\nfrom a wholly different transaction separate and apart from the originally pled breach of contract\naction. Heritage's first amended petition relates back to its original petition. Finding some evidence\nto support the jury's finding that the non-consent transactions were not barred by the statute of\nlimitations, we reject the legal sufficiency complaint. We also find that the great weight of the\nevidence does not support a finding that the complaint involving non-consent interest is barred by\nlimitations. Accordingly, we overrule both portions of Points of Error 3 and 25.\n\n\n2. Oxford.\n [32] [33] Heritage's claim for tortious interference and slander of title in connection with its\nagreement with Oxford were not specifically pleaded until May 1, 1992. The evidence in the record\nestablishes that the Oxford contract was dated May 10, 1987, but apparently executed in either late\nSeptember or early October of 1987, prior to Heritage filing suit. Thus, at the time Heritage filed its\noriginal petition there appears in the record at least some basis that a ripe claim existed for which\nit could seek recovery. Heritage's petition, although not specific as to the third party transaction\nthat had failed, did allege causes of action for tortious interference and cloud on title arising from\nHunt/Hill's attempts to remove Heritage as Operator. We find that Heritage's original petition was\nsufficient to vest the trial court with subject matter jurisdiction over the Oxford claim and the First\nAmended Petition filed on May 1, 1992 relates back to the original petition to preserve the cause of\naction. Further, Hunt/Hill did not specially except to Heritage's pleading and, therefore, any defect\nin pleading was waived. TEX.R.CIV.P. 90; TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 16.068;\nService Lloyds Ins.

We therefore overrule both portions of\nPoints of Error 7 and 29.\n\n\n3. Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron Transactions.\n [34] The evidence presented at trial with respect to the Sun transaction, the Enserch/Lone Star\ntransaction, and the Enron transaction conclusively established that they did not exist as causes\nof action at the time of Heritage's filing of its original petition. Instead, the evidence shows\nthat the Sun and Enron transactions came into existence and failed after December 18, 1987.\nWhile Heritage entered into negotiations with Enserch/Lone Star as early as September 1987, the\nevidence also shows that the transaction did not fail until after December 18, 1987. We determine\nthese transactions to be wholly new, distinct, and different transactions from the causes of action\npled in the original pleading, and as a result, the amended pleading may not relate back, pursuant\nto Section 16.068, to the date of the original pleading for the purposes of limitations. Ex parte\nGoad, 690 S.W.2d at 896–97; Duran, 921 S.W.2d at 791–92. Therefore, Heritage's claims based\nupon these transactions were, unlike the non-consent interests or Oxford, not ripe at the time of\nHeritage's filing of its original petition and were wholly different from the causes of actions raised\nin the original petition. Consequently, the trial court could not, as a matter of law, obtain subject\nmatter jurisdiction over these claims and the statute of limitations on these claims could not have\nbeen tolled as the claims did not exist. Thus, Heritage's first amended petition must be treated as\nits original petition for purposes of the subsequently arising causes of action. Under the applicable\nstatute of limitations, Heritage was required to file suit upon these claims within two years of the\ndate that such causes of action accrued, i.e., the date that injury to Heritage resulted.\n\n\na. The Sun Transaction.\n [35] Heritage has failed to cite to any evidence in the record, and we have found none, which\nsupports the jury finding that the Sun negotiations continued until April 30, 1990. Finding no\nevidence in the record to support the jury finding, we examined the record to determine if the\nevidence conclusively established an earlier date for the failure of the Sun transaction and accrual\nof Heritage's cause of action.\n\nRick Baldwin, manager of corporate acquisitions in 1988 and 1989, testified that Sun's\ninvolvement with Heritage began in 1988. Sun made two offers of contract to purchase Heritage's\ninterests in the Crittendon Field in February 1989 and March 1989. Michael Wisenbaker testified\nthat in December of 1987, there was no pending transaction between Heritage and Sun regarding\nHeritage's sale of its Crittendon Field interests. Furthermore, Heritage admitted in its brief that\nthe Sun transaction did not exist, either in contract or negotiation, in December of 1987, when\nHeritage's original petition was filed. The evidence is clear, unequivocal and convincing that\nSun terminated its contract with Heritage on March 13, 1989. We, therefore, find that the jury's\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Heritage should have filed suit on those causes of\naction not later than March 14, 1991. The first amended petition was not, however, filed until\nMay 1, 1992. Heritage is, therefore, precluded from recovery on the Sun transaction for tortious\ninterference with contract and slander of title as it failed to timely file suit on those claims.\n\n\nb. The Enserch/Lone Star Transaction.\n[36] Heritage, again, has not cited any evidence in the record and we have not found any evidence\nwhich supports the jury finding to Question 39 that the Enserch/Lone Star negotiations continued\nuntil April 30, 1990. Finding no evidence in the record to support the jury's finding that the\nEnserch/Lone Star negotiations continued until April 30, 1990, *120 we examined the record to\ndetermine if the evidence definitively established an earlier date for the failure of the Enserch/\nLone Star transaction and accrual of Heritage's cause of action.\n\nMichael Wisenbaker testified that there was no transaction between Heritage and Enserch/Lone\nStar that could have been interfered with in December of 1987. The evidence presented at trial of\nnegotiations between Heritage and Enserch/Lone Star establishes that the negotiations began in\nSeptember 1987 and continued until December 1988.\n\nHeritage entered into evidence a November 2, 1988 memo and copies of three contracts and one\nloan agreement that were to be executed between Heritage and Enserch/Lone Star. In a December\n7, 1988 memo, the parties contemplated execution of the contracts within two to four working\ndays. The contracts were never signed, evidencing the failure of negotiations between Heritage\nand Enserch/Lone Star in December 1988. Heritage's cause of action accrued at that time. The\njury's answer to Question 39 was not supported by legally sufficient evidence and we conclude\nthat the evidence conclusively established an earlier date for the failure of the Enserch/Lone Star\ntransaction.\n\nWe find the evidence to be clear, unequivocal, and convincing that Heritage's claims for tortious\ninterference and slander of title in the Enserch/Lone Star transaction accrued no later than\nDecember 1988. Heritage was required to file suit upon this cause of action not later than January 1,\n1991; the First Amended Petition was not filed until May 1, 1992. Therefore, Heritage is precluded\nfrom recovery on the Enserch/Lone Star transaction for tortious interference with contract and\nslander of title as it failed to timely file suit upon these claims.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Enron Negotiations.\n [37] Once again, Heritage has not cited any evidence in the record, and we have not found any,\nwhich supports the jury finding that the Enron negotiations continued until April 30, 1990. As\nwith the Sun and Enserch/Lone Star transactions, we have examined the record to determine if the\nevidence conclusively established an earlier date for the failure of the Enron transaction.\n\nMichael Wisenbaker testified that there were no transactions or negotiations with Enron that\ncould have been interfered with in December of 1987. Negotiations between Enron and Heritage\nbegan in the summer of 1989. A representative of Enron testified that the last correspondence\nbetween the parties occurred in February of 1990. Heritage has also admitted in its pleadings\nthat negotiations between Enron and Heritage were over as of January 10, 1990, and the last\ncorrespondence between the two parties was a February 9, 1990 letter from Heritage to Enron.\nThe evidence presented on the issue is clear and unequivocal that negotiations between the parties\nended no later than February 9, 1990, the date of the last correspondence. Consequently, Heritage's\ncause of action for the failed Enron transaction accrued no later than February of 1990 and Heritage\nwas obligated to file suit on this claim certainly no later than March 1, 1992. The First Amended\nPetition was filed on May 1, 1992. Heritage is, therefore, precluded from recovery for tortious\ninterference and slander of title claims as to Enron as it failed to timely file suit upon these claims.\n\n\nd. Application of the Extension Statute.\nHeritage nonetheless argues that its original petition filed on December 18, 1987, was broad\nenough to place in issue all the conduct raised in subsequent pleadings. Heritage's contention is\nthat since the original petition was timely filed, the first amended petition properly relates back\nto the original petition because the causes of action relate to the same transaction or occurrence.\nWe disagree.\n\nHeritage has cited various cases, 1 including a number we have relied upon, which allow *121\nfor the addition of claims or damages sought through post limitation amendments. We find the\nargument wide of the target. In all cases cited by Heritage there existed, at the time of the original\nfiling, a cause of action upon which the plaintiff could recover, and in each case the amendment\nonly altered the theory of recovery, added an additional claim of relief upon the same facts, changed\ncertain factual assertions, or sought to add to the amount claimed in damages.\n\n [38] The controlling issue is the definition of the term “transaction.” Heritage seeks to define\nthe term “transaction” as it is used in Texas Civil Practice and Remedies § 16.068 simply as the\nwrongful act. However, it is fundamental that torts stem from the consequence of acts, not from\nthe acts themselves. There must be some sort of injury in order for a plaintiff's cause of action to\naccrue. For slander of title, there must be the loss of a specific sale; for tortious interference with\ncontract, there must be an existing contract and then interference with the contract which results\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Heritage Resources, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2394073\"><a href=\"/opinion/2394073/hill-v-heritage-resources-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997)\n\n\n\nin harm. Without injury there are no damages, and without them both there is no recovery. We,\ntherefore, interpret the term “transaction” as it is used in Section 16.068, as that set of facts which\ngives rise to the cause of action premised thereon; in other words, as the totality of events which\nentitle a plaintiff to bring suit.\n\nThe case of Goad and its progeny provide useful interpretations of the extension statute which\nsupport our interpretation. In Goad, the Supreme Court explained that if the amended motion\n“does not allege a wholly new, distinct or different transaction, then it relates back to the original\nfiling and is not subject to a limitations defense.” Ex parte Goad, 690 S.W.2d at 896. In the\ninstant issue, there was no claim or cause of action upon which Heritage could seek recovery at\nthe time of filing its original petition. The evidence is clear that the Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and\nEnron transactions all came into existence and failed after the filing of the original petition. Most\nsignificant, however, is what they involved. The Sun transaction involved the negotiations for the\nsale of Heritage's entire interest in the Crittendon Field. While that would have obviously included\nHeritage's working interest in the 22 J.O.A., it is unrelated to the basic nature of the dispute or to\nthe causes of action originally pleaded. The Enserch/Lone Star and Enron transactions involved\ngas purchase agreements. The “transaction” upon which Heritage sought recovery in its original\npetition was clearly a different “transaction” from the “transactions” it sought recovery for in its\namended petition. The facts which would give rise to claims as to the Sun, Enserch/Lone Star,\nand Enron transactions simply did not exist at the time of the filing of the original petition. The\ncauses of action alleged in the first amended petition regarding the Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and\nEnron transactions arose from wholly new, distinct, or different transactions than that alleged in\nthe original petition. In either instance, we find that Heritage's claims for tortious interference and\nslander of title premised upon the Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron transactions are barred by\nlimitations.\n\n\ne. Automatic Stay Due to Bankruptcy.\n [39] [40] Heritage lastly argues that its involuntary bankruptcy in late August of 1989 stayed\nall proceedings against it until it emerged from bankruptcy in January of 1991. Relying on 11\nU.S.C.A. § 108 (1993), Heritage asserts that eighteen months must be added to the period in which\nit had to file its first amended petition. We simply do not read the statute that way. Section 108\nprovides that the limitations period includes any suspension occurring on or after commencement\nof the case in bankruptcy. The suspension referred to in Section 108 is that provided for in 11\nU.S.C.A. § 362 (1993) which is the automatic stay of all judicial proceedings that were or could\nhave been commenced before the case in bankruptcy against the debtor. Section 362 does not\napply to actions filed by the debtor. McMillan v.

Tortious Interference with a Contract or Prospective Business Relationship.\nTexas law protects existing and prospective contracts from interference. Juliette Fowler Homes,\nInc., 793 S.W.2d at 665. The principal difference between the two involves the requirement of a\ncontract as opposed to a potential for a contract and the question of justification or defense which\nis borne by the defendant in a tortious interference with contract case. The elements are: (1) the\nexistence of a contract subject to interference; (2) a willful and intentional act of interference; (3)\nthe act was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's damage; and (4) actual damage or loss occurred.\nHolloway, 898 S.W.2d at 795–96; Armendariz, 553 S.W.2d at 404. Like all business torts, these\nelements may seem simple but there are numerous exceptions.\n\n [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] The first requirement is essentially a qualification that there must\nbe a “contract subject to interference.” All contracts are not subject to interference. There must\nbe a valid contract. Juliette Fowler Homes, Inc., 793 S.W.2d at 665. The second requirement\nconcerning “willful and intentional” is dependent upon a strict requirement of adequate proof to\ndemonstrate this requirement.

Non–Consent Interests.\nHeritage claims that the development of the 22–3 well was properly proposed under the terms of\nthe 22 J.O.A., that Hunt/Hill elected not to participate in the operation, and that Heritage carried the\nnon-consenting interests of Hunt/Hill. The jury found that Heritage had both an agreement and a\nreasonable probability of making such an agreement to sell the non-consent interests that it claimed\nit carried in the 22–3 well to Craig Sandahl, Bruce Heafitz, Jack Bestrom, Mobil Producing Texas\nand New Mexico, and E.R. Duke.\n\n [50] [51] Because there were no non-consent interests created in the 22–3 well, any contracts\nor probability of entering into such contracts were void and not subject to interference. We find\nfrom the record before us that not only is there a complete absence of evidence to support the\nvital fact that there were non-consent interests in the 22–3 well, but that the evidence conclusively\nestablishes the opposite of that fact. Consequently, the first element of tortious interference with a\ncontract or prospective business relationship could not be legally or factually proven.

There is clear,\nprobative evidence that Hunt/Hill were aware and had actual knowledge of Heritage's attempts\nto market the claimed non-consent interests and sufficient evidence for a reasonable person to\nconclude Hunt/Hill's actions protesting Heritage's claim were actionable acts of interference which\nwas the proximate cause of damages suffered by Heritage. See State Nat'l Bank of El Paso, 678\nS.W.2d at 691.

As a result, if there had\nbeen non-consent interests to market, we would have sustained Points of Error 1b, c, and overruled\nPoints of Error 1d, e, and 2a. We need not address Point of Error 2b.\n\n\n2. Oxford.\nHunt/Hill complain that there is no or insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of tortious\ninterference with the participation agreement Heritage had with Oxford. Oxford entered a letter\nagreement dated May 10, 1987 with Heritage for Oxford to participate in the 22–3 well. Oxford\nagreed to bear 64.5 percent of all drilling and testing costs and 58.3 percent of the casing costs\nat completion in exchange for the assignment of an undivided working interest of 33.33 percent\nin the 22–3 well. Jerry Anderson, the president of Oxford, testified that Oxford received letters\nin March 1988 from attorneys representing Hunt/Hill asserting that Hunt/Hill were not non-\nconsenting and that their interests were not subject to being carried. He further testified that in\nAugust 1988, Oxford, which to that point had paid approximately four million dollars, decided to\ntake a proportional reduction in the working interest to be earned and ceased making payments\nto Heritage.\n\n [52] Considering only the evidence and reasonable inferences that tend to support the finding and\nignoring all evidence and inferences contrary to the jury's findings, we must conclude that there\nis at least some evidence of probative force to support the finding. It is clear from the record and\nuncontested that there was a valid and enforceable contract between Oxford and Heritage. There is\nalso direct evidence of actions by Hunt/Hill which establish evidence of acts of interference. What\nHunt/Hill do contest is whether there is any evidence or sufficient evidence to establish the element\nof willful intent and actual damages. We conclude that there was legally and factually sufficient\nproof for the jury to conclude that the act of interference by Hunt/Hill was the proximate cause of\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Though Oxford's president testified that the reason for stopping payments\non the participation agreement with Heritage was that of concerns that Heritage was diverting\nOxford's investment to other wells and uncertainty and lack of information about operations at the\n22–3 well, his testimony was contradicted, his credibility strongly challenged, and in particular,\nhis subsequent cooperation with Hunt/Hill could reasonably be considered suspect. Simply stated,\nthe evidence in this record furnishes some reasonable basis for differing conclusions by reasonable\nminds as to the existence of the essential facts. Moreover, in a no evidence challenge, the appellate\ncourt may not substitute its view of the credibility of witnesses for that of the jury. Benoit, 239\nS.W.2d at 797. We may not substitute our view of the credibility of witnesses for that of the jury in\na no evidence challenge, and as a result, that challenge here must fail. In light of all the evidence,\nwe are also unable to find the jury's verdict to be clearly wrong and manifestly unjust, so that there\nis factually sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Hunt/Hill's acts of interference\nwillful and knowing and proximately caused actual damage to Heritage.\n\n [53] The jury awarded 3.16 million dollars in actual damages for the tortious interference with\nthe Oxford contract. Though we are unable, from the record before us, to understand exactly what\ninterest in the 22–3 well that Oxford had bargained for, it is clear from the testimony elicited by all\nsides that Heritage's claimed non-consent interests formed at least part of the undivided interest to\nbe earned by Oxford. Given the evidence that Oxford had contributed approximately four million\ndollars before it ceased participating and evidence of the total drilling and production costs of the\n22–3 well, the jury's award for actual damages was both legally *126 and factually sufficient.\nWe, therefore, overrule Points of Error 5b, c, and 6a.\n\n\n3. Sun.\nThis transaction involved Sun negotiations to acquire all interests in the Crittendon Field. We have\nfound that Heritage's cause of action related to this transaction, and also the next two, Enserch/\nLone Star and Enron, are barred by the statute of limitations. We will, however, at least briefly,\naddress the merits of the points of error raised as a matter of judicial prudence.\n\nHunt/Hill challenge the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury finding that\nthey tortiously interfered with the Sun contract or probable contract to purchase all of Heritage's\ninterest in the Crittendon Field and the resulting jury award of more than $27.5 million. Beginning\nsometime in 1988 and culminating in the first quarter of 1989, Sun began negotiations to acquire\nthe Crittendon Field oil and gas interests which included the 21 and 22 J.O.A. interests. Sun made\ntwo offers to Heritage and Heritage verbally accepted the second offer made on March 9, 1989.\nAt approximately the same time, Sun also offered to purchase the interests of Hunt/Hill, and was\naware of pending litigation between Heritage and Hunt/Hill. On March 13, 1989, Heritage advised\nSun that the 22–2 well had begun producing water and Sun withdrew its offer of purchase.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We conclude that the only issues which\nmerit discussion are whether there was a contract subject to interference and proximate cause as\nwe find that the record establishes both legally and factually sufficient evidence to support the\njury's favorable findings of the other required elements and damages.\n\n [54] [55] It is clear and uncontradicted that at the same time Sun was negotiating with Heritage,\nit was also negotiating with Hunt/Hill. Indeed, it is evident that Sun was only interested in the\nacquisition of all working interests in the Crittendon Field. Hunt/Hill argue that because Sun was\nnegotiating with both sides here that as a matter of law, Hunt/Hill could not interfere with their\nown contract with Sun. We agree. Whatever the claimed actions of Hunt/Hill were or might have\nbeen, and notwithstanding the fact that Sun would have to acquire by separate contracts all various\nworking interests necessary to acquire the entire interest, because the financial interests of Heritage\nand Hunt/Hill were identical with respect to their business relationship to Sun, there can be no\nliability for the actions of Hunt/Hill. A party to a business relation cannot tortiously interfere with\nitself. Coastal Corp. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1515285\"><a href=\"/opinion/1515285/coastal-corp-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 720 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi,\n1993, no writ).\n\n [56] [57] Finally, we are unable to find any evidence of proximate causation. It is clear that Sun\nwithdrew its offer to purchase interests in the Crittendon Field because the 22–2 well had begun\nto water. We understand Heritage's argument to be that the reason why the business relationship\nwas terminated is not the issue, but rather delaying or hindering the negotiations. In other words,\nHunt/Hill prevented the sale of Crittendon Field before the 22–2 well watered out. A plaintiff\nmust be able to show that the act of interference was the proximate cause of the damages suffered\nby it. This is the classic proximate cause test with the component elements of cause in fact and\nforeseeability. State Nat'l Bank of El Paso, 678 S.W.2d at 691. We find that evidence is legally\ninsufficient to support a finding that Hunt/Hill's actions, if any, were the proximate cause of any\ndamages suffered by Heritage.\n\nWe overrule Points of Error 9d and 10a, and sustain Points of Error 9b, c, and e. We need not\naddress Point of Error 10b.\n\n\n4. Enserch/Lone Star and Enron.\n [58] We consider the last two transactions upon which Heritage recovered for tortious\ninterference together. Heritage sought to obtain a prepayment gas contract with Enserch/Lone\nStar. Heritage also negotiated *127 without success with Enron for a gas purchase agreement.\nThe jury found that Hunt/Hill tortiously interfered with those negotiations in each situation and\nawarded Heritage damages more than $23.2 million in connection with Enserch/Lone Star and\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hunt/Hill have challenged the legal and factual sufficiency of\nevidence with respect to all of the elements necessary under each claim of tortious interference.\nRecalling that we have held that Heritage's causes of action regarding this transaction are barred by\nthe statute of limitations, we have nonetheless considered the merits of Hunt/Hill's points of error\nregarding the sufficiency of evidence. With regard to the “no evidence” points, considering only\nthe evidence and reasonable inferences that tend to support the findings and ignoring all contrary\nevidence and inferences, we find that there is some evidence to support those findings. There was\ntestimony and documentary evidence of negotiations which a reasonable person might conclude\nwould result in a contractual business relationship. There was at least some evidence that Hunt/\nHill had knowledge of the negotiations, that there was an intent on the part of Hunt/Hill to interfere\nwith those negotiations, and that Hunt/Hill's actions were the proximate cause of the damages\nsuffered by Heritage. As for the damages awarded, there is some evidence in the form of Michael\nWisenbaker's testimony and various pricing and cost documents in the record.\n\nConsidering Hunt/Hill's challenge to the factual sufficiency, we have likewise concluded that after\nexamination of all the evidence, that we are unable to say that the evidence is so weak as to be\nclearly wrong and manifestly unjust. Though our own view of the evidence is different, we will not\nsubstitute our view for that of the jury where much of this case weighed upon the credibility of the\nprincipal witnesses on each side, moreover, we are mindful that a preponderance of the evidence\nunanimously convinced the jury in this case. We overrule Points of Error 13b, c, d, e, 14a, 17b, c,\nd, e, and 18a. We need not address Points of Error 14b and 18b.\n\n\nC. Slander of Title.\nThe issues involved in these series of points involve Heritage's position as the Operator under\nthe 22 J.O.A., that is, whether Heritage had the requisite interest to hold that position. Heritage's\nclaims arise from utterances and publishing challenges to Heritage's interest in the 22 J.O.A., that\nHeritage had been removed as Operator, that Heritage was a bad faith trespasser, and illegally\ndrilled the 22–3 well. The jury found that Hunt/Hill slandered Heritage's title to Sections 21 and\n22, and awarded actual damages of approximately $7.988 million with respect to the non-consent\nsales and $3.1 million with respect to the Oxford agreement. The jury found zero damages with\nrespect to Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron transactions; however, the trial court disregarded\nthe jury's verdict and awarded the same, respective damages as were awarded under the tortious\ninterference claims.\n\n [59] To prove slander of title, Heritage was required to show that Hunt/Hill published false\nstatements maliciously, and these statements caused special damages to Heritage's interest in land.\n“Malice,” for purposes of this tort, is defined as making false statements regarding title in absence\nof color of title or a reasonable belief that parties have title.

Non–Consent Interests.\n [60] Heritage's claim of slander of title and the award of damages with respect to the non-consent\ninterests fails as a matter of law because there were no non-consent interests to be sold. A plaintiff\nseeking to recover damages in a slander of title action must prove the loss of a specific sale in\norder to recover. A.H. Belo Corp. v. Sanders, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1749988\"><a href=\"/opinion/1749988/ah-belo-corp-v-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 146 (Tex.1982). Though the title or\ninterest claimed to have been maliciously disparaged is evidently distinct from the issue of whether\nor not there were non-consent interest carried by Heritage, the fact remains *128 that Heritage\nhad no non-consent interests to sell. Thus, we find that the evidence in the record conclusively\nestablishes the opposite of a vital fact and Hunt/Hill's no evidence challenge must be sustained\nwith respect to the non-consent interests. Points of Error 23b, c, d, e, f, and 24a are again sustained;\nwe need not address Point of Error 24b.\n\n\n2. Oxford.\n [61] As we have stated before, it is unclear what interests Oxford expected to earn in return for its\nparticipation in the 22–3 well. Certainly, there is some evidence that Oxford expected that it was\nindeed earning some of the non-consent interests which it understood that Heritage was carrying.\nHowever, the evidence is not conclusive that those interests were the exclusive consideration for\nOxford's participation agreement. As a consequence, we are unable to say that there is either a\ncomplete absence of evidence or that the evidence supporting the jury's finding is so weak as to\nbe clearly wrong and manifestly unjust.\n\n [62] [63] [64] We also find it clear from the record that the identical awards for both tortious\ninterference and slander of title for the same transactions are duplicative as a matter of law.

Victoria\nBank & Trust Co., 811 S.W.2d at 939. In a slander of title action, however, and unlike tortious\ninterference, the only privilege accorded defamatory remarks are for those remarks published as\na part of judicial proceedings. James, 637 S.W.2d at 916–17. Hunt/Hill nevertheless argue that\nbecause all communications regarding the non-consent interest were uttered or published after both\ntheir own lawsuit in Dallas County and this suit in Winkler that all communications are protected\nunder the judicial proceedings *130 privilege. We conclude, however, that there is some evidence\nthat Hunt/Hill's communications were neither preliminary to nor in contemplation of any judicial\nproceeding, and their utterance or publication, even though after the institution of the law suits, is\nnot absolutely privileged. We accordingly overrule both portions of Point of Error 26.\n\n\n2. Oxford.\n [76] As was noted earlier, it is not entirely clear from the record exactly what working interests\nin the 22–3 well Oxford sought to acquire as consideration for its participation agreement with\nHeritage. From the testimony of Oxford's president, Jerry Anderson, and the questions presented\nto him by all sides, it does seem clear that Oxford thought it was participating to gain the non-\nconsent interests that Heritage maintained it was carrying, but we also find it evident that more\nthan just non-consent interests were involved. As a consequence, we cannot say, as we did above,\nthat there is no evidence in the record to conclusively establish that Hunt/Hill were justified or\nexcused in their interference, nor do we find that the great weight of the evidence in favor of\njustification to be so contrary to the jury's adverse finding on the issue as to be manifestly unjust.\n\nFinally, we have also found sufficient evidence in the record of utterances and publications that\nwere outside and beyond the protection and privilege accorded judicial proceedings. Accordingly,\nwe overrule Points of Error 8 and 30.\n\n\n3. Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron.\n [77] Considering the same factors as this Court did in Maynard, 752 S.W.2d at 721, and\ncomparing those factors to the record before us, we are unable to find that the evidence with\nregard to the Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron transactions was either legally or factually\ninsufficient. The same result is reached whether the burden of establishing a privilege is on Hunt/\nHill or Heritage. Hunt/Hill's principal argument relies upon the absolute privilege accorded judicial\nproceedings; however, there are pleadings and evidence of probative force in the record which\nwe find to be neither preliminary to nor in contemplation of a judicial proceeding. As a result,\nHunt/Hill's no evidence and insufficient evidence challenges, as to the tortious interference and\nslander of title actions involving the Sun, Enserch/Lone Star, and Enron transactions must fail.\nWe overrule Points of Error 12, 16, 20, 34, 38, and 42.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The jury agreed. Hunt/Hill's complaint here is three-fold: first, that the claim sounds\nin contract, not tort; second, that any recovery for fraud is waived by the failure of Heritage to\nobtain a finding of damages for fraud; and thirdly, that there is no evidence or insufficient evidence\nto support a finding of fraud.\n\n [78] We have already rejected the argument that Heritage's claims sound only in contract, not\ntort. Indeed, the claim here is precisely the situation where a party's actions regarding a contract\nmay rise to the level of a tort. See American Nat'l Petroleum Co., 798 S.W.2d at 278. Every\ncontract, including J.O.A.s, carries the common law duty to perform the agreed tasks with care,\nskill, reasonable expedience, and faithfulness so that a breach thereof constitutes a tort as well as\na breach of contract. Montgomery Ward & Co., 204 S.W.2d at 510. As we earlier noted, the Texas\nSupreme Court reaffirmed that concept, holding that “tort damages are recoverable for a fraudulent\ninducement claim irrespective of whether the fraudulent representations are later subsumed in a\ncontract or whether the plaintiff only suffers an economic loss related to the subject matter of the\ncontract.” Formosa *131 Plastics Corp. USA, 41 Tex.Sup.Ct.J. at 293, 960 S.W.2d at 44.\n\n [79] The jury was first asked, in Question 8, to decide whether the 22–3 well was covered by\nthe 22 J.O.A.; an affirmative answer then required them to decide in Question 11 that Hunt/\nHill's failure to comply with the 22 J.O.A. was not excused. Question 12 then asked if Hunt/Hill\nagreed to participate in the 22–3 well in exchange for Heritage's stopping drilling of the 22–2 well.\nAgain the jury responded affirmatively, requiring them to answer Question 13, which was whether\nthose actions constituted a fraud on Heritage, and again, the jury said “yes.” Conditioned upon an\naffirmative finding in Question 12, the jury was then asked, in Question 14, to assess damages\nfor Hunt/Hill's “failure to pay their shares of the 22–3 well costs.” Hunt/Hill now contend that no\ndamages question was submitted in connection with the fraud found; hence, any recovery for fraud\nwas waived. We do not construe the jury findings so narrow as to find that Heritage is precluded\nfrom any recovery for fraud. Though the question of damages was predicated upon an affirmative\nanswer to the action described in Question 12, which the jury found to constitute fraud in Question\n13, we conclude that there was a proper finding of actual tort damages by the jury.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In considering a legal sufficiency or “no evidence” point, an appellate court\nconsiders only the evidence which tends to support the jury's findings and disregards all evidence\nand inferences to the contrary. Garza, 395 S.W.2d at 823; Worsham Steel Co., 831 S.W.2d at 83.\nIf any probative evidence supports the jury's determination, it must be upheld. In re King's Estate,\n244 S.W.2d at 661–62; see generally William Powers, Jr. & Jack Ratliff, Another Look at “No\nEvidence” and “Insufficient Evidence,” 69 TEXAS L.REV. 515 (1991). A factual sufficiency\npoint requires examination of all of the evidence in determining whether the finding in question\nis so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust. In\nre King's Estate, 244 S.W.2d at 661; Worsham Steel Co., 831 S.W.2d at 81. The reviewing court\ncannot substitute its conclusions for those of the jury. If there is sufficient competent evidence of\nprobative force to support the finding, it must be sustained. Carrasco, 623 S.W.2d at 772.\n\n[80] The elements of common law fraud have long been recognized in Texas as:\n\n   • that a material representation was made;\n\n   • that it was false;\n\n   • that, when the speaker made it, he knew it was false or made it recklessly without any\n      knowledge of its truth and as a positive assertion;\n\n   • that he made it with the intention that it should be acted upon by the party;\n\n   • that the party acted in reliance upon it; and\n\n   • that the party thereby suffered injury.\n\nState Nat'l Bank of El Paso, 678 S.W.2d at 681. Another key factor is whether the Hunt/Hill's\npromise to participate in the 22–3 well is actionable because at the time the promise was made\nHunt/Hill made it with the intent not to perform the promise. Spoljaric, 708 S.W.2d at 434.\n\n [81] [82] [83] [84] We first note that the 22 J.O.A. unambiguously provides circumstances in\nwhich a well can be stopped short of its contract depth: (1) if further drilling is rendered impractical\nby granite or any other impenetrable substance or condition in the hole; or (2) if all parties agree\nto complete or abandon the well at a lesser depth. It also, as previously discussed, specifically\ndelineates the procedures to follow for proposing a new well. Once a new well is proposed in\nwriting, a party to the J.O.A. can then elect to take a consent position which then results in the\nobligation to pay the new well costs. But notwithstanding the contractual rights to consent or not\nconsent to the stopping of the 22–2 well, and subsequently, the right to consent or not consent to\nparticipate in the 22–3 well, we find that the record amply supports a jury finding of an independent\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It is clear from the record the Hunt/Hill wanted drilling on the 22–2 well stopped because of\nnegotiations for the sale of their interest in the Crittendon Field. That, however, required unanimity\nby all working interest *132 owners under the terms of the J.O.A. There is also ample probative\nevidence for the jury to conclude that Hunt/Hill never intended to consent to a subsequent drilling\noperation which they were obligated to do under the terms of the J.O.A., or take a non-consent\ninterest. The critical focus being whether there is sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find that\nHunt/Hill's promise to participate in the 22–3 well is actionable because at the time the promise was\nmade Hunt/Hill made it with the intent not to perform the promise. Spoljaric, 708 S.W.2d at 434.\nWhile a party's intent is determined at the time the party made the representation, it may be inferred\nfrom the party's subsequent acts after the representation is made. Id. Since intent to defraud is not\nsusceptible to direct proof, it invariably must be proven by circumstantial evidence. Id. at 435.\nSlight circumstantial evidence of fraud, when considered with the breach of a promise to perform,\nis sufficient proof to support a finding of fraudulent intent. Id. The record contains sufficient\nevidence from which a reasonable jury could have inferred fraudulent intent. One example of this\nevidence is the transcript of the conversation between the Hunt brothers and Michael Wisenbaker\nthat took place on September 25, 1987. Unbeknownst to Wisenbaker, the Hunts secretly recorded\nthe conversation in which they told Wisenbaker: (1) that they were not contemplating the sale of\ntheir interests in the field, even though they had already initiated negotiations with Lyco Energy\nCorp; (2) that they wanted Wisenbaker to cease all drilling operations in Section 22, though for\nobvious reasons, they did not disclose to Wisenbaker that this was a condition precedent to the\nsale of their interests to Lyco Energy Corp; (3) that they had the requisite votes to remove Heritage\nas Operator, another misrepresentation; and (4) that they would remove Heritage as Operator if\nHeritage did not immediately cease all drilling operations in Section 22, notwithstanding their\nagreement to participate in the 22–3 well as a substitute well. Another example of this evidence is\nVirgil St. Clair's assertion that the 22–2 well had reached a depth sufficient to test the Fusselman\nformation when he was fully aware that the 22–2 well had not penetrated the Fusselman formation.\nOther examples of evidence supporting the jury's finding of fraudulent intent are the Hunt brothers'\ndenials at trial. At trial, both Hunt brothers denied that they had promised to participate in the\n22–3 well once Heritage agreed to stop drilling the 22–2 well. Ample evidence was produced\nto the contrary. A party's denial that he ever made a promise is a factor showing no intent to\nperform when he made the promise. Spoljaric, 708 S.W.2d at 435. We conclude that there was\nsufficient evidence for a rational jury to find that Hunt/Hill's promise to participate in the 22–3\nwell was actionable because at the time the promise was made Hunt/Hill made it with the intent\nnot to perform the promise. We also note that Hunt/Hill have never seriously disputed the factual\nsufficiency of the allegation and only tried to classify it as being legally insufficient as a claim\nsounding only in contract, not tort. Consequently, we overrule Point of Error 53.\n\n\n\n                                                         IX.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Specifically, Question 12 asked if any of the Defendants or their agents, “agree to pay\ntheir share of the 22–3 well costs in May, 1987 in exchange for Heritage's stopping the drilling of\nthe 22–2 well?” Since the jury answered Question 12 in the affirmative, they proceeded to answer\nQuestion 14 awarding Heritage damages for the defendants' failure to pay their share of the 22–\n3 well costs. Hunt/Hill challenge this recovery on legal and factual sufficiency grounds and on\nthe theory of Statute of Frauds.\n\n\nA. Standard of Review\nNeither of the parties argue that the terms of the J.O.A. are ambiguous, they merely disagree as\nto the form of consent necessary under the J.O.A. to accept the proposal of a *133 new well.\nHunt/Hill argue that the J.O.A. is subject to the Statute of Frauds because it involves contracts for\nthe sale of real estate. Heritage contends that the ultimate question regarding this issue is whether\nHunt/Hill consented to participate in the 22–3 well. In arguing this point, Heritage urges that\nunder the requirements of the J.O.A., the parties can orally consent to participate in drilling a well\nand, even if the J.O.A. is subject to the Statute of Frauds, the oral agreement comes within the\npartial performance exception to the Statute of Frauds and is therefore enforceable.

C & C Partners, 783 S.W.2d at 714–15. That Court then found that\noral consent was sufficient to obligate the parties to participate in the well. Id. at 715.\n\nThe Dallas Court's conclusion is, however, only dicta, as the question in that case was whether\nor not consent had to be evidenced by means of a AFE. We certainly agree that consent or non-\nconsent to participate in the drilling of a new well does not need to be in any particular form;\nhowever, we disagree that it can be oral. The C & C Partners Court concluded that the contract\nprovisions only required written confirmation of responses to telephonic notices, and that since\nconfirmation of consent was distinct and separate *134 from consent, there was no requirement\nof a writing. This logic fails for two reasons. First, telephonic notices and responses are limited by\nthe operating agreement to “rework, plug back or drill deeper” operations and then only when the\ndrill rig is on location. Article VI.B.1.

Proposal.\nEven if oral consent to the drilling proposal were authorized, Heritage's oral proposal to drill a\nsubstitute well for the failing 22–2 well failed to satisfy the initial proposal requirements under\nthe 22 J.O.A. Heritage was required, under Article XII. of the J.O.A., to propose the drilling of\nthe new well by notice in writing, specifying the details of its development as required by Article\nVI.B.1. Such an oral proposal also violates the 22 J.O.A. by (1) proposing the well to fewer than\nall of the parties to the J.O.A., and (2) by failing to specify the details surrounding the development\nof the new well including location, depth, objective formation, and estimated cost.\n\nThus, Appellees' oral proposal for drilling the 22–3 well violated the provisions of the J.O.A.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the alleged oral agreement to pay the 22–3 well costs in exchange for\nstopping drilling the 22–2 well fails as a matter of law.\n\n\nC. Statute of Frauds.\nHunt/Hill have also asserted that the J.O.A. is subject to the Statute of Frauds because it involves\ncontracts for the sale of real estate. Heritage counters that even if the Statute of Frauds applies, the\noral agreement is enforceable under the partial performance exception. We believe that Statute of\nFrauds does apply and the oral agreement does not come within the partial performance exception\nto the doctrine because Heritage could not have relied on the oral agreement to its detriment.\n\n\n1.

Specifically, the 22 J.O.A. states under Article VIII.A.\nthat the “leases covered by this agreement, insofar as they embrace acreage in the Contract Area,\nshall not be surrendered in whole or in part unless all parties consent thereto.” Thus, the 22 J.O.A.\nnecessarily governs the transfer of interests in the oil and gas leases subject to the agreement.

Because\nthe objective of the 22–3 well was to reach the Ellenburger formation at a depth of approximately\n22,000 feet, and since the 22 J.O.A. was limited to maximum depth of 20,000 feet, the oral\nagreement would also constitute a material amendment of the J.O.A. depth limitations requiring\nit to be in writing.

The Hunts,\nin attendance, contested the drilling of the 22–3 well and asserted that no wells should be drilled\npending Heritage's sale of its own interests in the wells. In November, the Hunts' attorney advised\nHeritage that the 22–3 well, was outside the contract area as contemplated by the J.O.A. because\nit was proposed to a depth of 22,000 feet. Finally, on December 18, 1987, Tribal Drilling filed an\naction in Dallas County seeking judgment that Heritage owned no interest in the contract area and\nrequesting a temporary restraining order to cease Heritage's operations. On December 28, 1987,\nHeritage began drilling operations on the 22–3 well.\n\nIn light of the numerous repudiations of the alleged oral agreement between the Hunts and\nHeritage, as well as the initiation of drilling operations on the 22–3 well after suit was brought\nto enjoin Heritage from such drilling, we do not find that Heritage's performance under the oral\ncontract was done in reliance upon the oral contract. Consequently, there is no performance such\nthat refusal to enforce the agreement would result in a “virtual fraud” upon Heritage as its actions,\nas a matter of law, were not done in good faith reliance upon the May oral agreement. In light of\nour determination that the performance exception to the Statute of Frauds does not apply in this\ninstance, we find that Heritage's claim for breach of the 22 J.O.A. is barred as a matter of law.\n\nPoint of Error 54b is sustained and because of this resolution, we do not address the remaining\nPoints of Error 54a, c, and 55.\n\n\n\n                                                         *136 X.\n\n\n                                        Remainder of Points of Error.\n\n\n        Points of Error 21, 43a, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 56, 57, 58, 59,60, 61, 62, 63.\n\nA. Exclusion of Findings of the Railroad Commission.\nHunt/Hill challenge the trial court's refusal to admit into evidence or judicially notice the Railroad\nCommission's Proposal for Decision on Heritage's Field Designation Application. At trial, Hunt/\nHill admitted into evidence the Texas Railroad Commission's Final Order which denied Heritage's\nrequest for authorization from the Commission to complete the 22–3 well in the same reservoir\nas the 22–2 well. The Commission's Final Order adopted as its own the findings of fact and\nconclusions of law of the Examiner's Proposal for Decision (“PFD”). The PFD stated in Findings\nof Fact 33 that Heritage intended the 22–3 well to be a test of the Silurian interval already being\nproduced by the 22–2 well.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Trial Court's Refusal to Take Judicial Notice of the PFD.\n [97] Texas Rule of Civil Evidence § 201 imposes a mandatory obligation upon a trial court\nto judicially notice facts: (1) if properly requested by a party; (2) if the court is supplied with\nthe appropriate information; and (3) if the fact is of a kind that may properly be noticed.\nTEX.R.CIV.EVID. 201(b) & (d). Since it is undisputed that Hunt/Hill properly requested judicial\nnotice and supplied the court with the appropriate information, we need only address whether\nthe PFD of the Railroad Commission was the proper subject matter for judicial notice. A\njudicially noticed fact must be one that is not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either:\n(1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court; or (2) capable of\naccurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be\nquestioned.

Thus, when a court or an\nagency finds facts concerning the immediate parties, including who did what, where, when, how,\nand with what motive or intent, the court or agency is performing an adjudicative function, and the\nfacts are called adjudicative facts. 2 Kenneth S.

Collateral Estoppel.\n[99] Hunt/Hill argue that Findings of Fact 33 of the Railroad Commission PFD collaterally estops\nHeritage from denying that it intended the 22–3 well to be a test of the Silurian interval already\nbeing produced by the 22–2 well.

However, the record before\nus is void of any motion for summary judgment or motion to dismiss the issues previously decided\nby the Commission on the basis of res judicata or collateral estoppel. Therefore, there is no order\nfrom the trial court denying such motion and preserving such error. Furthermore, during trial,\nHunt/Hill attempted to prove the admissibility of the Commission's Order and PFD apparently\non the basis of relevancy to the proceedings, not on the basis of collateral estoppel. Bearing the\nburden of establishing their affirmative defense of collateral estoppel, Hunt/Hill were obligated to\nplead and prove its elements. Having failed to obtain a ruling, not on the admissibility as evidence,\nbut on the issue of collateral estoppel of the issues litigated before the Railroad Commission, we\nfind there can be no error in this regard.\n\n [102] Moreover, any error in failing to admit into evidence, or judicially notice, the Commission's\nPFD is harmless error. Findings of Fact 33 specifically found that Heritage intended that the 22–\n3 well be a test of the Silurian interval. Hunt/Hill contend that this “intention” finding establishes\nthat Heritage breached the provision of the J.O.A. which provides that “without the mutual consent\nof all parties, no well shall be completed in or produced from a source of supply from which a well\nlocated elsewhere on the Contract Area is producing....” [Emphasis added]. However, Findings of\nFact 23 of the PFD found that “it was never the intention of Heritage Resources, Inc., to complete\nthe No. 22–3 well in the Crittendon (Silurian) Field. Heritage knew that the existence of the No. 22–\n2 well in that field on a 640 acre lease prevented a regular permit for the No. 22–3 well.” [Emphasis\nadded]. Thus, Findings of Fact 23 clearly negates Hunt/Hill's position as to Heritage's breach of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The only declaratory relief\ngranted by the trial court was as follows:\n\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED and DECLARED that Heritage Resources, Inc. has since on or\n   before December 17, 1987 owned an interest in Sections 21 and 22 of Block C–23, PSL Survey,\n   Winkler County, Texas and that such interest was sufficient for Heritage to serve as operator of\n   those Sections under the Joint Operating Agreements to those Sections.

(“Declaration Two”)\n\nHunt/Hill challenge the trial court's granting of declaratory relief claiming that the court erred\nin submitting questions of law, or questions which were the subject of undisputed evidence, to\nthe jury. Specifically, Hunt/Hill challenge five of the jury's findings upon which such declaratory\nrelief was premised. First, Hunt/Hill challenge the jury's finding in response to Questions 1 and 3,\nthat Heritage did not breach any of its duties under the Section 21 and 22 J.O.A.s before or after\nSeptember 1987.

Declaration One—Interest to Serve as Operator.\n [103] In order to properly serve as operator under the J.O.A., the operator must own an “interest”\nin the contract area. However, neither the Section 21 J.O.A. nor the Section 22 J.O.A. contains\na definition of the term “interest.” Hunt/Hill argue that Heritage had to possess a cost bearing\ninterest. Heritage argues record title is sufficient. Thus, the issue becomes whether record title\nqualifies as an interest sufficient to satisfy the J.O.A.\n\n [104] Interpretation of an unambiguous contract term is a question of law for the trial court.

Exhibit A to the 22 J.O.A. contains a listing of\nall “Interests of the Parties.” Within this listing are seventeen names and two columns of percent\ninterests labeled “Before Payout Working Interest” and “After Payout Working Interest.” Heritage\nis at the very top of the list with a significant percent interest before and after payout. Thus, at the\ntime of the signing of the J.O.A., Heritage was disclosed as an interest owner. Hunt/Hill presented\nno evidence that Heritage's entire interest under the Section 22 J.O.A. had been transferred or\nconveyed after the signing of the J.O.A.\n\nCiting to several property cases, Hunt/Hill argue that there is a distinction between “record title”\nand “ownership.” However, this argument is futile in light of unequivocal trial testimony. Hunt/\nHill's own attorney, Michael Nugent, testified that by signing the J.O.A., Heritage assumed a\ncost-bearing interest which obligated them to pay a proportionate share of the costs of drilling\nwells on Section 22. Moreover, there was expert testimony from Marvin Wigley, a member of the\ncommittee of the American Association of Petroleum Landmen that drafted the A.A.P.L. Form\n610, used for the Section 21 and 22 J.O.A.s, that record title is a sufficient interest to satisfy the\nownership interest requirement for operator status under the J.O.A.\n\nThe sum total of Hunt/Hill evidence in support of their contention that Heritage had to possess\na cost bearing interest is the argument that without such a requirement the operator would have\nno incentive to minimize costs and that non-operators would be left unprotected. In light of the\ntestimony of Hunt/Hill's own attorney stating that Heritage did possess a cost-bearing interest,\nHunt/Hill's argument must fail. Furthermore, given the fact that Heritage was listed as a working\ninterest owner, and that expert testimony revealed that record title is sufficient under the J.O.A., we\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Declaration Two—Breach of the J.O.A.\n [105] [106] [107] [108] The jury found that Heritage had not breached the J.O.A. The trial\ncourt entered a declaratory judgment that “Heritage ... has not breached any of its duties....”\nWhether or not Heritage did in fact breach any of its duties under the J.O.A. was a question of fact\nand was therefore, properly submitted to the jury. The jury found that Heritage had not breached\nthe J.O.A.s.

If a factual dispute is\nthe only issue to be resolved, a declaratory judgment is not the proper remedy. Emmco Ins. Co.\nv.

Accordingly, we find that Declaration\nTwo was not the proper subject matter for a declaratory judgment.\n\n [109] Hunt/Hill next contend that there was legally insufficient evidence, or alternatively, it was\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence, for the jury to find that Heritage did\nnot breach any of its duties under the J.O.A.s. Hunt/Hill proffer three instances which they claim\nunequivocally establish Heritage's breach of the J.O.A.s. First, Hunt/Hill argue that Heritage's\ninsolvency resulted in its automatic deemed resignation. However, Hunt/Hill drafted the jury\nquestions regarding Heritage's status as Operator. Broad form questions were used and Hunt/Hill\ndid not request an issue on Heritage's bankruptcy as it affected its status as Operator. Therefore,\nany error is waived. See TEX.R.APP.P. 52(a), 49 TEX.B.J. 561 (Tex.1986, superseded 1997).\nAdditionally, there is evidence that there was never a vote to remove Heritage as Operator during\npendency in bankruptcy which is required for removal under the J.O.A.\n\nSecond, Hunt/Hill contend that Heritage engaged in wrongful billing practices. However, there is\nsubstantial evidence that the Hunts and Hills knew of and agreed to “vendor deals.” Furthermore,\nexpert testimony revealed that the J.O.A. would not prohibit “vendor deals.” Finally, Hunt/Hill\nargue that Heritage failed to obtain the requisite consent for the perforation of the 21–1 well. In\nsupport of this argument, Hunt/Hill claim that there had to be written authorization. Noting our\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Heritage Resources, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2394073\"><a href=\"/opinion/2394073/hill-v-heritage-resources-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997)\n\n\n\nprevious discussion on breach of contract, written consent was required for the proliferation of the\n21–1 well. However, there was some evidence presented on this issue indicating that a request was\nmade by the Hunts for Heritage to conduct further activity on the 21–1 well. Thus, considering\nall three points of dispute, we cannot hold that the jury's finding that Heritage did not breach its\nduties under the J.O.A. was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. There was\nsufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Heritage did not breach its duties under the\nJ.O.A. Therefore, the trial court was proper in granting Heritage's declaratory relief with respect\nto Declaration One but not with respect to Declaration Two. Furthermore, in light of this analysis,\nthe trial court was correct in denying all of Hunt/Hill's requests for declaratory relief relating\nto Heritage's performance as Operator. Also, due to our disposition of the other points of error\nregarding the 22–2 well and the Section 22 J.O.A. and our analysis of the other issues of *141\ndeclaratory judgment, we cannot find that the trial court erred in denying Hunt/Hill other requests\nfor declaratory relief as they relate to the 22–2 well. Points of Error 48, 49, 50, 51, and 52 are\noverruled.\n\n\nC. Recovery Against Distributees of A.G. Hill and the Hill Group.\nHunt/Hill further complain of the trial court's granting of relief against A.G. Hill's successors in\ninterest on two grounds. First, Hunt/Hill contend that as of the filing of the May 1, 1992 First\nAmended Petition, the statute of limitations on all claims asserted against these defendants had\nrun and that therefore, any recovery was precluded as a matter of law. Secondly, Hunt/Hill argue\nthat these parties were not properly substituted into the lawsuit. A.G. Hill was a named defendant\nin Heritage's original petition filed on December 18, 1987. Mr. Hill died in June of 1988, during\nthe pendency of this litigation. On May 1, 1992, Heritage added Margaret Hunt Hill, Executrix\nof the Estate of A.G. Hill, and the Margaret Hunt Hill Martial Trust, the Albert G. Hill, III Trust,\nthe Heather Victoria Hill Trust, the Elisa Margaret Hill Trust, the Michael Bush Wisenbaker, Jr.\nTrust, the Wesley Hill Wisenbaker Trust, Cody McArthur Wikert Trust, and the Margretta Hill\nWikert Trust, as defendants in its first amended petition as A.G. Hill's successors-in-interest.\n\n\n1. Statute of Limitations.\n [110] Heritage's original petition was sufficient to put in issue a cause of action against A.G.\nHill for fraud. The fraud upon which Heritage sought recovery was the alleged May 1987 oral\nagreement whereby the Hunts agreed to pay their share of the drilling costs of the 22–3 well. Since\nthe cause of action preceded the filing of Heritage's original petition, it was therefore a ripe claim\nand the trial court was properly vested with subject matter jurisdiction as of the date of filing the\nOriginal Petition. Accordingly, Heritage's first amended petition, which was based in part upon\nthis same transaction relates back to the original petition in accordance with TEX.CIV.PRAC. &\nREM.CODE ANN. § 16.068. Therefore, Heritage's recovery against these defendants, if properly\nsubstituted as A.G. Hill's successors in interest, will not be precluded on the basis of statute of\nlimitations.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Proper Parties.\n [111] Hunt/Hill next argue that there is absolutely no evidence that either the distributees of A.G.\nHill or anyone else in the Hill Group, other than Virgil St. Clair and A.G. Hill, engaged in any\nactionable misconduct and that therefore, recovery against them is improper. However, with regard\nto the joinder of A.G. Hill's distributees as proper party defendants, Hunt/Hill did not file a Verified\nAnswer denying liability in the capacity in which they were being sued or asserting the existence\nof a defect in parties. TEX.R.CIV.P. 93. Additionally, the parties voluntarily entered the lawsuit by\njoining in the counterclaim. Furthermore, Hunt/Hill wholly failed to object to their inclusion in the\njury questions. Consequently, any error based upon this theory is waived by failure of the parties\nto object. TEX.R.APP.P. 52(a), 49 TEX.B.J. 561 (Tex.1986, superseded 1997); Lemons v. EMW\nMfg.

Hunt/Hills' Points of Error 61a and 61b are overruled.\n\nLikewise, the record reflects that Heritage's Second Amended Petition alleged that A.G. Hill and\nVirgil St. Clair were the apparent ostensible agents of the entire Hill group. The Hill Group's\nanswer failed to deny any of these agency allegations. Furthermore, Hunt/Hill did not object to any\njury question or jury issue which included them as defendants on the grounds of lack of evidence\nof agency, or any other grounds. Consequently, any error based upon this theory is waived by\nthe parties' failure to object. TEX.R.APP.P. 52(a), 49 TEX.B.J. 561 (Tex.1986, superseded 1997);\nLemons, 747 S.W.2d at 373. Accordingly, Hunt/Hill's Points of Error 56, 57, and 58 are overruled.\n\n\nD. Duplication of Damages.\nHunt/Hill allege in Points of Error 21 and 43a that the trial court erred in overruling their motions\nfor new trial, motions to disregard jury answers, and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and\nin entering *142 judgment against them because the damages awarded by the jury in Questions\n21, 25, 32, 37a, and 37b are duplicative of one another. In light of our holding that Heritage is\nnot entitled to recover on any of its tortious interference or slander of title claims, with the sole\nexception of the claims regarding the Oxford transaction, and in light of our disposition of Point\nof Error 28b, we need not address Points of Error 21 and 43a.\n\n\nE. Damages Awarded to Van Oliver, Trustee.\nIn Point of Error 62, Hunt/Hill urge that the trial court erred in awarding damages in favor of the\nIntervenor Van Oliver, Trustee because the Trustee's claims and damage award are derivative of\nHeritage's claims and damages. It appears from the record that all parties to the action stipulated to\nan agreement whereby Van Oliver, Trustee, for the benefit of certain trade creditors of Heritage,\nwould receive 15 percent of any award Heritage received in the suit. Appellees agree that\nthe Trustee's recovery is derivative of Heritage's recovery and as such, is directly portional to\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It therefore appears that the judgment must be reformed to reflect that Van\nOliver's award is to be recovered from Heritage's award. We sustain Point of Error 62.\n\n\nF. Seven Falls Company.\n [112] Hunt/Hill claim in Point of Error 63 that the trial court erred in entering judgment against\nSeven Falls Company and in denying the corporation's motion to strike all claims against it. Seven\nFalls Company was first named as a party to the suit by the Hill Group's counterclaim filed August\n17, 1992. However, it is undisputed that Seven Falls was not named as a party in either the First\nAmended Counterclaim or Second Amended Counterclaim filed by the Hill Group Hunt/Hill on\nAugust 19, 1992 and September 22, 1992, respectively. Appellees argue that Seven Falls remained\na party after the filing of the Hill Group's counterclaim on August 17, 1992, despite the omission\nof Seven Falls from the first and second amended counterclaims because Seven Falls did not file\nnonsuit after that date.\n\nUnder Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 65, an amended pleading supersedes and supplants the\noriginal pleading. In Burton v. Bridges, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2440480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2440480/burton-v-bridges/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1982, writ ref'd\nn.r.e.), we held that under Rule 65 “[p]arties to a suit are just as effectively dismissed from a suit\nby omitting their names from an amended pleading as where a formal dismissal order is entered.”\nSee Evans v.

However, Hunt/Hill argue that Seven Falls was never served with process.\nHeritage does not contend that Seven Falls was served with process but instead relies on Seven\nFalls' voluntary joinder in the suit by way of the original counterclaim. Because we find that the\nomission of Seven Falls from the amended counterclaims effectively dismissed them from the suit,\nit was Appellees' burden to serve Seven Falls with citation in accordance with Texas Rule of Civil\nProcedure 99. See Evans, 711 S.W.2d at 746. Appellees failed to comply with such rules. Hunt/\nHill made a motion to strike all claims against Seven Falls Company and obtained an unfavorable\nruling from the trial judge. However, regardless of the title of the motion, Hunt/Hill substantively\nargued the improper joinder of Seven Falls as a defendant. See Cherry v. North Am. Lloyds of\nTexas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1715451\"><a href=\"/opinion/1715451/cherry-v-north-american-lloyds-of-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">770</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, writ denied)(opin. on motion for\nreh'g).

However,\nsegregation is not required if services are rendered “in connection with claims arising out of the\nsame transaction and are so interrelated that their ‘prosecution or defense entails proof or denial\nof essentially the same facts.’ ” Stewart Title Guar. Co., 822 S.W.2d at 11.\n\n [115] Heritage asserts three bases for upholding the award of attorney's fees: (1) contract; (2)\ndeclaratory judgment; and (3) real estate fraud. Since no jury issue or question was either requested\nor presented on the real estate fraud question, and no recovery was had on a claim of real estate\nfraud, the fees are unsupportable under this theory. Likewise, because we have determined that\nthe Statute of Frauds bars enforcement of the May oral agreement, Heritage's claim for breach\nof contract fails as a matter of law and consequently, there can be no recovery of attorney's fees\nbased upon this ground. Therefore, only Heritage's suit for declaratory judgment will support the\ntrial court's award of attorney's fees.\n\n [116] [117] [118] The trial court granted Heritage two forms of declaratory relief. “In any\nproceeding [for declaratory judgment] the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary\nattorney's fees as are equitable and just.” TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 37.009.\nThe award of such costs and fees is within the discretion of the trial court and such an award\npremised upon an action for declaratory judgment will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear\nshowing of an abuse of discretion.

GUY COLE, Circuit Judge.\n\nTwenty-seven Texas plaintiffs seeking recovery for injuries resulting from allegedly faulty breast\nimplants engaged in settlement negotiations with the implants' manufacturer, Dow Corning\nCorp., a Michigan company. After the discussions reached an impasse over terms covering\nthe consequences in the event settlement payments were not timely, Dow Corning suggested a\nclause requiring payments of $100 per day to each plaintiff for any time during which settlement\npayments were late. The plaintiffs agreed to this clause, and entered into the settlement agreement,\nlater selling their right to settlement payments to Appellant Bear Stearns. When Dow Corning\ndeclared bankruptcy and began to miss payments under the settlement agreement, Bear Stearns\nattempted to enforce the clause via a bankruptcy claim. The district court, on Dow Corning's\nmotion for summary judgment, held that the clause was a penalty unenforceable under Texas law,\nand also found that a condition precedent to the contractual provision of liquidated damages had\nnot been met. Bear Stearns now appeals, arguing that the condition precedent was in fact met,\nand that Dow Corning should be estopped from asserting that the clause is a penalty. Because the\nclause is a penalty unenforceable under Texas law, and because Texas courts preclude parties from\nbeing estopped from asserting an illegality defense, we AFFIRM the decision below.\n\n\n\n                                                     I.\n\nFollowing revelations that many of Dow Corning's silicone-based breast implants were faulty,\nnumerous suits were filed against Defendant–Appellee Dow Corning Corp. (“Dow Corning”).\nTwenty-seven Texas residents (“Plaintiffs”) filed suit in Texas state court in 1994, alleging various\nclaims against Dow Corning. Dow Corning found itself “under significant pressure” to settle these\ntwenty-seven cases, especially since any findings of fact made in these cases (the “Texas cases”)\ncould have significant adverse effects upon Dow Corning's position in a related multi-district case\nand related global settlement discussions then pending in federal court in Alabama. Dow Corning\nwas also motivated to settle because of its view that the Texas cases were filed in a “plaintiff-\nfriendly” forum. Dow Corning thus hired Ken Feinberg, a noted expert in settlement practice, to\nengage in settlement negotiations with the Plaintiffs.\n\n *547 But for one sticking point, the negotiations went smoothly. Both parties agreed that Texas\nlaw would control the settlement agreement. Dow Corning would pay the Plaintiffs a total of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This payment\nwould be secured by an “Agreed Judgment” filed in Texas court, though the judgment would\nbe enforced only if Dow Corning failed to make a timely settlement payment. Plaintiffs' counsel\nwould be responsible for determining what portion of the $17 million each individual Plaintiff\nwould receive. Further, if Dow Corning ever were late on an installment payment, the entire\nsettlement amount would come due. However, near the end of negotiations, Plaintiffs' counsel\ninsisted on a clause (the “no credit clause”) which provided that if Dow Corning ever failed to\nmake a timely payment, it would not receive credit against the judgment for previously made\npayments. For example, under this clause, if Dow Corning failed to make a required final payment\nof $200,000 to a particular Plaintiff, that Plaintiff would be able to enforce the “agreed judgment”\nagainst Dow Corning for the full settlement amount of $1,400,000, rather than merely for the\n$200,000 portion of the judgment remaining unpaid. This would occur despite the fact that the\nPlaintiff in this example would already have received $1,200,000 of the $1,400,000 due. Plaintiffs'\ncounsel justified this clause by stating that it would provide a significant incentive for Dow\nCorning to pay scheduled payments on time.\n\nNot wishing to place itself in a position where it could potentially be required to “double-pay”\na significant portion of the settlement, Dow Corning steadfastly objected to the no credit clause.\nHowever, Dow Corning by its own admission at this time felt “a tremendous sense of urgency to\nfinalize the settlement.” Accordingly, Dow Corning's attorneys proposed replacing the no credit\nclause in each Plaintiff's agreement with language requiring a “penalty” of $100 to be paid for\neach day that Dow Corning was late in paying a particular Plaintiff. After insisting that all uses\nof “penalty” be changed to “liquidated damages,” and after making some insignificant stylistic\nchanges, Plaintiffs' attorneys agreed to insert the following language proposed by Dow Corning:\n\n            In the event that [Dow Corning] fails to make any payment in accordance\n            with [the] Agreement, and Plaintiff must seek enforcement of the judgment to\n            obtain the amounts due, then [Dow Corning] will pay to Plaintiff, as liquidated\n            damages, the sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per day for each day that\n            payment is not made from the date payment was due until the date Plaintiff\n            receives the full amount due and owing under the terms of this agreement. These\n            liquidated damages shall be in addition to the assessment of costs and interest as\n            provided in the agreed judgment and the acceleration of installment payments\n            as provided in [ ] the Agreement.\n\nThe Plaintiffs' attorneys noted at that time that if the new provision provided for a “penalty,” the\nprovision would not be enforceable under Texas law.\n\nThe parties agreed on this language, and inserted the clause into each settlement agreement.\nDow Corning paid the first installment payment, totalling $4 million, on December 1, 1994.\nHowever, on May 15, 1995, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy in the Eastern District of Michigan,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

All of the Plaintiffs timely filed claims in bankruptcy\ncourt for the amounts due under the settlement agreement. In February 1997, while the bankruptcy\n *548 case was pending, the Plaintiffs all sold their claims to Appellant Bear Stearns Investment\nProducts, Inc., and related entities (collectively, “Bear Stearns”). Bear Stearns was then substituted\nfor the Plaintiffs in the bankruptcy case.\n\nYears later, a reorganization plan was approved for Dow Corning. The plan included payment to\nBear Stearns of the full remaining settlement amount of $13 million, plus post-petition interest of\n$9.6 million. 1 During bankruptcy proceedings, Bear Stearns also claimed liquidated damages in\nthe amount of $8.75 million pursuant to the settlement agreement. Dow Corning filed an objection\nto this portion of Bear Stearns's claim, and the bankruptcy court, without any written findings,\nsustained the objection and disallowed the liquidated damages portion of the claim. Bear Stearns\nappealed to the district court. Since Dow Corning was fully solvent and had agreed to pay whatever\nthe district court determined was due, the court allowed the confirmed plan to become effective\nwhile the liquidated damages appeal was pending. As a result, just after the plan's effective date,\non June 1, 2004, Bear Stearns was paid the $22.6 million both parties agreed was due under the\nplan. Meanwhile, Bear Stearns and Dow Corning each had filed a motion for summary judgment\nin district court with regard to the additional liquidated damages. The district court denied Bear\nStearns's motion, and granted summary judgment to Dow Corning, finding that the liquidated\ndamages clause was a penalty unenforceable under Texas law, and that even if it were not, a\ncondition precedent to any award of liquidated damages had not been met. The district court\nthen certified the grant of summary judgment as final, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), since the ruling\nconclusively resolved all claims with regard to the liquidated damages clause.

However, since the instant appeal is from both the grant of\nsummary judgment to Dow Corning and the denial of summary judgment to Bear Stearns, it is\nappropriate to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party.\n\n [6] Finally, under Texas law, the determination of whether a contract term is properly a liquidated\ndamages provision or instead an unenforceable penalty is purely a question of law.

While this passage from Langever, taken alone, is supportive of the district court's holding,\nthe district court ignored the fact that this was only one factor to be considered under Texas law.\nThe plaintiff in Langever alleged that, due to non-payment on the contract at issue, he had lost\nsignificant profits (as, presumably, he was intending to reinvest the money once received), and\nthat the liquidated damages term had been an attempt to estimate the result of his not having been\npaid. Despite the dicta cited by the district court in the instant case, the Langever court went on\nto state first that, “Where it is certain that damages will flow, and where it is certain they cannot\nbe accurately measured, or where it appears their ascertainment, if possible, will be difficult, the\nbest reasons exist for respecting the agreement of the parties in advance upon a sum mutually\nsatisfactory.” Id. The Langever *551 court then granted enforcement of the clause, despite its\ndicta, noting that “Any effort to establish the actual damages for a breach of a contract such as the\none under consideration here would be attended with such unusual considerations and surrounded\nwith such uncertainty and difficulties as to take the case out of the usual class of cases of mere\ndefault in the payment of money, and thus to afford fair grounds for sustaining an agreement for\nliquidated damages.” Id.\n\nAccordingly, Langever merely stands for Texas's consistent law that liquidated damages clauses in\ncontracts for payment of money are unenforceable except when damages are particularly difficult\nto estimate. Bear Stearns argues that the liquidated damages clauses in the instant case were\nintended to compensate for difficulties encountered by the Plaintiffs were they not to receive the\nsettlement monies they were expecting to receive. According to Plaintiffs' attorneys, such damages\nspecifically included losses sustained by the Plaintiffs' inabilities to meet obligations they had\nmade based on the promise of Dow Corning to make payments under the settlement agreement.\nBear Stearns alleges that such difficulties would have been particularly difficult to estimate here,\nbecause Plaintiffs' difficulties included damages beyond the usual “lost investment opportunities”\nand inabilities to make house and car payments. Rather, Bear Stearns asserts that the clause was\nalso intended to compensate for difficulties resulting from a failure to be able to meet future\nobligations incurred in expectation of receiving settlement payments, including obligations such\nas future (and inherently unpredictable) medical services required due to illness caused by the\nallegedly faulty implants, and also Plaintiffs' “decisions to discontinue working if they could afford\nto do so.”\n\nOn this prong, Dow Corning raises two arguments in addition to that relied upon by the district\ncourt. First, Dow Corning argues that the items Bear Stearns claims would be “damages” following\nnon-payment are actually damages that the initial settlement itself had contemplated, and thus the\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Bear Stearns responds\nby noting that the liquidated damages provision was not intended to cover medical expenses\nresulting from the faulty implants, but rather to compensate for additional costs associated with\nreceiving late payments from Dow Corning. We agree with Bear Stearns that this conclusion is\nreasonable in light of Langever, which specifically allowed liquidated damages in a situation in\nwhich future damages resulting from non-payment were likely to be more than the time-value of\nmonies owed under the original contract.\n\nDow Corning's second argument is that the parties simply were not anticipating any additional\ndamages from non-payment, difficult to calculate or otherwise. Dow Corning cites to the fact\nthat the liquidated damages clause was initially proposed as a “penalty,” and that none of the\nattorneys in the case from either side could remember any discussions regarding difficult-to-\ncalculate damages. In contrast, Bear Stearns notes that at least one of the Plaintiffs' attorneys stated\nspecifically that “the liquidated damages provision was to recognize that [Plaintiffs] would have\nlosses sustained by their inability to meet the obligations that they had made based on the promise\nof Dow Corning to make payments under this Agreement.” These duelling assertions, however,\ngo to the question of whether the provision was actually a just forecast of any damages, and not\nto whether such damages, if contemplated, would be difficult to calculate. Dow Corning does\nnot argue that the damages *552 resulting from non-payment of settlement monies, including\ninability to meet future medical and other obligations, would be easy to calculate. Obviously, the\ntwenty-seven Plaintiffs would each face differing levels of such damages, and in this particular\ncase, no party has argued that the Plaintiffs' medical or other obligations were uniform or\npredictable. Accordingly, Dow Corning has failed to show that the anticipated damages would not\nbe difficult to estimate.\n\n\n2. Was the Liquidated Damages Clause a Reasonable Forecast of Just Compensation for\nSuch Damages?\n [12] The district court also gave two reasons for concluding that Bear Stearns ought to lose on\nprong two, regarding whether the amount of liquidated damages was a reasonable forecast of the\namount necessary to render just compensation. Unsurprisingly, Dow Corning agrees with both.\nFirst, the district court found that the $100 per day simply was not a forecast of compensation for\nany damages, but rather was initially intended as a penalty. Second, the district court concluded\nthat even if the Plaintiffs' attorneys had intended this clause as compensation for damages, there\nwas no evidence that the likely amount of such damages was ever estimated at all or that it was\ncompared with $100 per day, nor was any evidence provided that any negotiations over what\namount would be reasonable compensation had ever occurred. The district court concluded that\nthe clause thus was not a “reasonable forecast of just compensation.”\n\nBear Stearns argues that the burden was on Dow Corning to prove that the clause was not a\nreasonable forecast, and that Dow Corning simply has not presented any evidence that the clause\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

However, this argument both discounts the evidence\nDow Corning has presented and overstates Dow Corning's burden. Dow Corning has presented\nevidence that the parties did not discuss potential uncertain damages resulting from breach, and has\nalso presented evidence that the clause was initially proposed as a penalty untied to any potential\ndamages.\n\nBear Stearns argues that the district court unfairly shifted the burden of proof to Bear Stearns.\nHowever, such a shifting was not improper in light of evidence presented by Dow Corning\nthat is probative of a lack of both intent to provide just compensation and the existence of any\nconsideration of any estimates of what just compensation would be. Bear Stearns's only statement\nto counter Dow Corning's evidence of a lack of connection between the clause and any estimate of\ndamages is that “[g]iven the large number of individual Plaintiffs and the difficulty in estimating\neach Plaintiff's actual damages in the event of a breach by Dow, the $100 per day figure was\na reasonable estimate of those damages.” This argument may reasonably rebut one of Dow\nCorning's other arguments, that the damages were not reasonably predictive of damages potentially\nor actually incurred by any one specific Plaintiff. Regardless, however, the fact that there are\nnumerous Plaintiffs or that each Plaintiff's damages were uncertain does not logically imply that\n$100 per day was a reasonable estimate of damages.\n\nBear Stearns further argues that “[h]aving proposed the $100 per day figure, Dow clearly believed\nit was reasonable at the time.” However, such an inference cannot be made. When Dow Corning\nproposed the $100 figure, the uncontradicted evidence shows that it intended the figure as a\npenalty, and not as a reasonable estimation of some set of damages. Bear Stearns cites no evidence\ntying the $100 figure to any of the types of damages it claims Plaintiffs were estimated to face\n *553 post-breach, while Dow Corning cites evidence probative of an absence of a concern for\nwhether $100 was just compensation. For this reason alone, Bear Stearns's arguments fail. See,\ne.g., Anderson v.

Accordingly, the district court should not have\nconcluded that enforcement of the liquidated damages clause would constitute double recovery.\nNonetheless, because Dow Corning provided evidence that the provisions were not actually\nreasonable estimations of any anticipated damages from breach, the second prong of the liquidated\ndamages test, and thus the result of the entire test, was properly resolved in Dow Corning's favor.\n\n\n3. Are the Liquidated Damages Disproportionate to the Actual Damages Incurred by\nPlaintiffs?\nBecause Dow Corning has met its burden of proving that the clause was not a reasonable estimation\nof any anticipated damages, the entire three-part test must be resolved in its favor. See, e.g., Baker,\n812 S.W.2d at 55. Therefore, we need not determine whether the “liquidated damages” under the\nclause would be disproportionate to any actual damages incurred by Plaintiffs.\n\n\nC. Quasi–Estoppel and Unenforceable Liquidated Damages Clauses\n [13] [14] [15] Under Texas law, the illegality of a liquidated damages clause is an affirmative\ndefense that must be asserted by a defendant when it is not clear from the face of the agreement\nthat the clause is illegal. See, e.g., Phillips v. Phillips, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 789–90 (Tex.1991). Bear\nStearns argues that the doctrine of quasi-estoppel should prevent Dow Corning from being able to\nassert this affirmative defense, and therefore that the liquidated damages clause should be enforced.\nQuasi-estoppel is appropriate where “it would be unconscionable to allow a person to maintain\na position inconsistent with one to which he acquiesced, or from which he accepted a benefit.”\nLopez v. Muñoz, Hockema & Reed, L.L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376524\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376524/lopez-v-munoz-hockema-reed-llp/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 864 (Tex.2000) (citing Atkinson Gas\nCo. v. Albrecht, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2410327\"><a href=\"/opinion/2410327/atkinson-gas-co-v-albrecht/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240 (Tex.Ct.App.1994)). Bear Stearns argues that since Dow\nCorning proposed the clause in order to induce settlement with the Plaintiffs, thereby avoiding\ncostly litigation, Dow Corning cannot now assert that the clause is illegal. However, regardless\nof whether quasi-estoppel would be appropriate here, *554 Texas courts have clearly stated that\none cannot be estopped from arguing that a contract term is illegal for public policy reasons. See,\ne.g., In re Kasschau, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1960773\"><a href=\"/opinion/1960773/in-re-kasschau/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 312–14 (Tex.Ct.App.1999); see also In re Calderon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1377526\"><a href=\"/opinion/1377526/in-re-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719–20 (Tex.Ct.App.2003). Accordingly, under Texas law, Dow Corning simply\ncannot be estopped from asserting the affirmative defense of illegality, even if quasi-estoppel\nwould otherwise be applicable. Because Dow Corning did indeed assert this defense, and because\nwe conclude that this defense has merit, Bear Stearns's argument fails.\n\n\n\n                                                    III.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meknojiya moved for summary judgment on the sole ground that Khan's recovery under the\nholdover provision is barred as a matter of law because it represents an unenforceable penalty in\nthe form of “double-rent.” The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Meknojiya,\nand following a bench trial only on attorney's fees, the court rendered a final judgment that Khan\ntake nothing on his claims and that Meknojiya recover attorney's fees.

In 1996, Khan and Meknojiya entered\ninto a written lease agreement, and Meknojiya began operating a convenience store on the leased\npremises. The parties renegotiated their lease (“the lease”) in March 2002. The renegotiated lease\nrequired Meknojiya to pay $4,500 per month in “base rent” and included the following paragraph,\nwhich the parties refer to as a “holdover provision”:\n\n           2.07 Holding Over.If Tenant does not vacate the Leased Premises upon the\n           expiration or earlier termination of the Lease, Tenant shall be a tenant at\n           sufferance for the holdover period and all of the terms and provisions of this\n           Lease shall be applicable during that period, except that Tenant shall pay\n           Landlord (in addition to additional rent payable under this Lease and any other\n           sums payable under this Lease) as base rental for the period of such holdover\n           an amount equal to two times the base rent which would have been payable by\n           Tenant had the holdover period been a part of the original terms of the Lease\n           (without waiver of Landlord's right to recover damages as permitted by law).\n\nAccording to Khan, Meknojiya committed a series of breaches following execution of the 2002\nlease. For instance, Khan contends that Meknojiya (1) failed to obtain or renew required insurance,\n(2) failed to provide the required insurance documentation, and (3) permitted a corporation owned\nby other individuals to operate the convenience store without obtaining Khan's prior written\nconsent. Khan notified Meknojiya in writing, through counsel, that Meknojiya was in default of\nthe lease and that Khan was exercising his option to terminate the lease effective May 1, 2002.\nNevertheless, despite additional notices of default, Meknojiya continued to occupy the premises\nand to pay $4,500 per month until January 2, 2007, the date the lease was set to have expired by\nits own terms.\n\nKhan subsequently sued Meknojiya for breach of the lease, asserting that upon Meknojiya's breach\nof the lease and Khan's notification that the lease was terminated, Meknojiya occupied the property\nas a tenant at sufferance.

After conducting a\nhearing, the trial court granted Meknojiya's motion for summary judgment but denied Khan's\nmotion. Following a bench trial on Meknojiya's remaining counterclaim for attorney's fees, the trial\ncourt rendered a final judgment incorporating the trial court's order granting summary judgment\nin favor of Meknojiya and ordering Khan to pay $60,191.71 in attorney's fees. 2 In three issues on\nappeal, Khan argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Meknojiya\nand consequently, in awarding Meknojiya attorney's fees as the prevailing party.\n\n\n\n                                       STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nWe review a trial court's ruling on summary judgment de novo.

Accordingly, a liquidated-\ndamages provision is not enforceable if, in effect, it is a penalty. See id.(“Whether a contractual\nprovision is an enforceable liquidated damages provision or an unenforceable penalty is a question\nof law for the court to decide.”). A liquidated-damages provision is enforceable only if a court\nfinds that (1) the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) the\namount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.Id. Whether\na liquidated-damages provision is an unenforceable penalty is a question of law for the court,\nalthough sometimes factual issues must be resolved before the court can decide the legal question.\nId.\n\nIn his first and second issues on appeal, Khan argues that the trial court erred in granting\nMeknojiya's summary-judgment motion because Meknojiya failed to conclusively establish the\nessential elements of his affirmative defense of penalty. Specifically, Khan argues that, as a matter\nof law, paragraph 2.07 is not an unenforceable penalty provision because it is not a liquidated-\ndamages provision at all. Instead, according to Khan, paragraph 2.07 simply sets forth the parties'\nagreed rental rate for any holdover period. Based on the unambiguous language of the lease, we\nagree.\n\nWhether a contract term is a liquidated-damages provision is a question of law for the court.\nValence Operating Co., 164 S.W.3d. at 644. “The term ‘liquidated damages' ordinarily refers to\nan acceptable measure of damages that parties stipulate in advance will be assessed in the event\nof a contract breach.”Flores v.

Here,\nparagraph 2.07 sets an agreed-upon rental rate for situations in which the tenant has failed to\nsurrender the leased premises upon expiration of the lease term or earlier termination by one of the\nparties. The provision itself describes the amount due during the holdover period as “base rental for\nthe period of such holdover.”Further, paragraph 2.07 states that payment of such rental amounts\ndo not waive the landlord's right to recover “damages as permitted by law.” In other words, based\non the plain language of the lease, there is no indication that the parties intended the amounts owed\nunder paragraph 2.07 as a means of forecasting damages in the event of a breach. And, while rent\nunder paragraph 2.07 may, in certain circumstances, form the basis of measuring damages, it does\nnot independently set a damages amount or attempt to calculate damages. Simply put, any amount\nowed under paragraph 2.07 does not equate to a stipulated measure of damages; rather, it is an\nagreed-upon rental amount that is due under particular circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See Meridien Hotels, Inc. v. LHO Fin.\nP'ship I, L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1760250\"><a href=\"/opinion/1760250/meridien-hotels-inc-v-lho-financing-partnership-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.). In Meridien Hotels, the landlord\nleased hotel space to the tenant under a lease that required the tenant to pay 1.5 times the base\nrental amount if the tenant remained in the space upon termination of the lease by one of the parties\nor the lease term's expiration. 3 Id. at 822.The landlord sent the tenant a notice of termination of\nthe lease, but the tenant remained in the hotel space anyway. Id. at 814.The landlord eventually\nsued the tenant, seeking multiple types and amounts of damages, including $2,130,136 in holdover\nrent, plus prejudgment interest, all of which the trial court awarded. Id.\n\n *4 The tenant appealed, claiming that the holdover rent provision was an unlawful penalty and\nthat, as a result, the trial court erred in awarding pre-judgment interest on that amount. Id. at\n822.Concluding that the holdover rental rate did not constitute a penalty, the court of appeals\nconcluded that the provision “does not punish appellants; it instead requires that if appellants make\nthe decision to hold over beyond the term of the lease, they must pay a higher rate for doing so.\nAppellants were on notice that [the landlord] considered the lease terminated, yet they chose to\nstay, having agreed in the lease to pay 1.5 times the usual rent for doing so.”Id.\n\nLikewise, in this case, paragraph 2.07 of the parties' lease agreement sets out in advance the rent to\nbe paid should the tenant choose to remain on the premises after one of the parties terminates the\nlease or the lease expires by its own terms, creating a tenancy at sufferance. Upon expiration or\ntermination of the lease, the tenant must decide whether to (1) leave the leased premises (assuming\nhe is not forcibly removed) or (2) hold over under the lease as a tenant at sufferance and pay\nadditional rent at the agreed holdover rate. Such additional rent is not a penalty; in fact, it does\nnot represent liquidated damages at all. Rather, the additional rent is the agreed-to, bargained-for\namount of rent due and owing in the event of a holdover. 4\n\nBecause paragraph 2.07 of the parties' lease agreement is not a liquidated-damages provision, it\ncannot be an unenforceable penalty, as a matter of law. We therefore conclude that the trial court\nerred in granting summary judgment in favor of Meknojiya on this ground. In addition, because\nMeknojiya should not have prevailed on summary judgment, it follows that he was not entitled to\nattorney's fees. We sustain appellant's first and second issues on appeal. 5\n\n\n\n                                               CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

LHO Financing Partnership I, L.P., contained the following provision:\n              Any holding over by Tenant after the expiration or sooner termination of this Agreement shall be treated as a daily tenancy at\n              sufferance at a rate equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the Rent and other charges herein provided (prorated on a daily basis).\n           </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1760250\"><a href=\"/opinion/1760250/meridien-hotels-inc-v-lho-financing-partnership-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.)\n4       Meknojiya relies on Phillips v. Phillips, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1991), for the proposition that a contractual provision in which one\n        party agrees to pay the other some multiple of damages is an unenforceable penalty. Phillips is a classic illustration of a liquidated-\n        damages provision that constitutes an unlawful penalty. In the midst of divorce proceedings, a husband and wife agreed to create\n        a limited partnership rather than divide their substantial assets. Id. at 786–87.The agreement contained the following provision: “If\n        the general partner breaches his trust hereunder, he shall pay to the limited partner as liquidated damages ten times the amount she\n        loses as a result of such breaches of trust.”Id. at 787.In other words, once actual damages were established for breach of the parties'\n        contract, they would be multiplied by ten to reach the damages award. Id. at 789.The supreme court held that this provision was an\n        unenforceable penalty provision, rather than an enforceable liquidated damages provision. Id.\n           Meknojiya's reliance on Phillips in this case is misplaced. First, unlike paragraph 2.07, the provision at issue in Phillips was\n           undisputedly a liquidated-damages provision. As previously discussed, paragraph 2.07 is not a liquidated-damages provision at\n           all, but instead is a rental amount that is triggered if and when the lease expires or is terminated. Second, the liquidated-damages\n           provision at issue in Phillips was an unenforceable penalty on its face because the amount awarded by the provision was computed\n           by multiplying actual damages (once established).See id. at 789.Here, paragraph 2.07 does not require a separate determination of\n           damages or the application of any multiplier to that amount. Thus, even if we were to conclude that paragraph 2.07 is a liquidated-\n           damages provision, unlike the court in Phillips we could not conclude that it constitutes a penalty on its face.\n5       In his third issue on appeal, Khan argues that, even if the double-rent rate set forth in paragraph 2.07 represents liquidated damages,\n        Meknojiya failed to satisfy his burden to establish that it is an unenforceable penalty. Having sustained Khan's first and second issues\n        on appeal, we do not address this issue.

On appeal, the buyer (1) challenges the plaintiffs' standing to\nbring the suit, (2) contends that the liquidated damages clause of the contract is an unenforceable\npenalty, and (3) argues that the evidence that the buyer breached the contract is insufficient to\nsupport the trial court's judgment. We affirm in part and reverse and render in part.\n\n\n\n                                            BACKGROUND\n\nAlbert and Jennifer Magill entered into a contract to purchase residential real estate from the Estate\nof William H. Watson, Sr. (“the Estate”). The original closing date of the contract was November\n25, 2008, and, by amendment, was extended by agreement of the parties until January 25, 2009.\nThe Magills deposited $8,000 in earnest money with the title company in connection with the\ncontract and amendment.\n\nThe contract provided that the “Buyer may object in writing to defects, exceptions, or\nencumbrances to title ... which prohibit the following use or activity: Construction of a new, single\nfamily residential home to be two stories containing approximately 5,000 square feet.”\n\nThe garage on the house that the Magills wished to build encroached on the rear set back line of the\nproperty, and the Magills were unable to obtain a variance from the homeowner's association to\nallow the construction of the garage as planned. On January 23, 2009, two days before the closing\ndate, the Magills terminated the contract. The escrow agent sent two forms authorizing release of\nthe earnest money; one form released the earnest money to the Magills and one form released the\nearnest money to the Estate. The Magills signed the form authorizing the release of the earnest\nmoney to themselves.\n\nAfter obtaining an assignment from the Estate on January 27, 2009, the trustees of the William\nHugh Watson, Jr. Trust–Non–Exempt and the Robin Watson Livesay Trust–Non–Exempt, filed\nsuit against the Magills on August 26, 2009, alleging breach of the contract. On June 29, 2009,\nthe trustees sent the Magills a letter demanding that they execute a release of the earnest money.\nThe Magills did not do so. The trustees filed suit against the Magills on August 26, 2009, alleging\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     2\n\fMagill v.

DEFAULT: If Buyer fails to comply with this contract, Buyer will be in default, and Seller\n  may (a) enforce specific performance, seek such other relief as may be provided by law, or both,\n  or (b) terminate this contract and receive the earnest money as liquidated damages ....\n\n  18.D. DAMAGES: Any party who wrongfully fails or refuses to sign a release *677 acceptable\n  to the escrow agent ... will be liable to the other party for liquidated damages in an amount\n  equal to the sum of (i) three times the amount of the earnest money; (ii) the earnest money; (iii)\n  reasonable attorney's fees; and (iv) all costs of suit.\n\nThe case was tried to a jury, which found that the Magills had breached the contract. Thereafter, the\ntrial court entered a final judgment awarding the trustees $32,000.00, which represents the earnest\nmoney and liquidated damages in an amount of three times the earnest money, plus attorney's fees,\ninterest, and costs.\n\n\n\n                                              STANDING\n\nOn January 27, 2009, before suit was filed by the Estate, the Estate executed the following\nassignment to the trusts:\n\n            For and in consideration of $10.00 and other good and valuable consideration,\n            the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and confessed, the\n            Estate of William H. Watson, Sr., Deceased (the “Estate”) does hereby bargain,\n            sell, transfer and convey to the Williams Watson, Jr. Trust—Non–Exempt and\n            the Robin Watson Livesay Trust—Non–Exempt, in equal, undivided shares,\n            (a) all of the right, title and interest of the Estate in, to and under that certain\n            One to Four Family Residential Contract (Resale) (the “Contract” between the\n            Estate, as Seller, and Albert E. Magill and Jennifer T. Magill (collectively, the\n            “Magills”)), as Buyer dated effective August 25, 2008, and (b) all claims and\n            causes of action of the Estate against the Magills pertaining in any way to the\n            Contract and defenses of the Estate to any claims of the Magills pertaining in\n            any way to the contract.\n\nIn their first issue, the Magills contend that appellees Watson and Livesay, as trustees of the\nWilliam Watson, Jr. Trust and the Robin Watson Livesay Trust, did not have standing to\nbring a breach-of-contract claim against them. Specifically, the Magills argues that “the estate's\nassignment to appellees of the estate's causes of action against appellants is void when no cause of\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thus, a “cause of action” encompasses\nevery essential fact that a plaintiff must prove to obtain a judgment. F.D.I.C., 869 S.W.2d at 378.\nThus, by definition, a cause of action may exist before a suit is instituted.\n\n [14] Therefore, we hold that the fact that the Estate had not filed suit before it assigned its cause\nof action to the trusts is not a ground for concluding that the trustees lack standing. And, to the\nextent that the Magills are complaining that the trustees pleadings did not set forth the basis for\ntheir interest in the petition, we note that the Magills did not specially except to the petition on\nthat ground, thus the issue is waived.

(Emphasis added).\n\n [15] [16] [17] [18] We enforce a liquidated damages clause if (1) the harm caused by the\nbreach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) the amount of liquidated damages is a\nreasonable forecast of just compensation.

See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. For example, in Phillips, the Texas Supreme Court\nobserved that “to show that a liquidated damages provision is unreasonable because the actual\ndamages incurred were much less than the amount contracted for, a defendant may be required to\nprove what the actual damages were.” Id.\n\nThe Magills, relying on Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788, contend that the liquidated damage provision\nis void on its face and no further evidence of the actual damages was required. We agree.\n\nIn Phillips, a partnership agreement contained the following liquidated damage provision in the\nevent of a breach of trust by the general partner to the limited partner: “If the general partner\nbreaches his trust hereunder, he shall pay to the limited partner as liquidated damages ten times the\namount she loses as a result of such breaches of trust.” Id. at 787. The supreme court granted an\napplication for writ of error “to decide whether a contractual provision that requires payment of a\nmultiple of actual damages for breach of trust is an unenforceable penalty[,]” and held as follows:\n\n            The enforceability of the contractual provision in this case involves no fact\n            issues. A contractual provision like the one here by which one party agrees to pay\n            the other some multiple of actual damages for breach of the agreement does not\n            meet either part of the legal test for an enforceable liquidated damages provision.\n            It cannot meet the first prong of the test because the harm caused by the breach\n            of the contract is not incapable or difficult of estimation. The provision assumes\n            actual damages can and will be determined, indeed must be determined, before\n            the prescribed multiplier can be applied. The provision cannot meet the second\n            prong of test because, instead of attempting to forecast actual damages, it calls\n            for them to be determined and then multiplied. A contractual provision like the\n            one in this case is thus, on its face, an unenforceable penalty.\n\nId. at 789 (internal citations omitted).\n\n [19] Here, the breach triggering the liquidated damage provision is the “wrongful[ ] fail[ure]\nor refus[al] to sign a release acceptable to the escrow agent.” However, the liquidated damage\nprovision makes no attempt to quantify the actual damages that would be caused by a failure to\nrelease the earnest money. Instead, the provision merely assumes that the earnest money, which\nthe parties have agreed will constitute actual damages for breach of the agreement in general,\nshould be trebled and added to the earnest money in the event that the obligation to release the\nearnest money is breached.\n\nThe trustees argue that “it is only natural that the liquidated damages for which paragraph 18.d\nprovides would be greater than [the earnest money] for which paragraph 15 provides, for the party\nentitled to the earnest money is forced to go through additional hoops it would not otherwise have\nhad to go through to ultimately obtain a recovery.” However, the damages suffered as a result of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Likewise, the $80,000 the\ntrustees claim that they suffered as a result of selling the property at a lower purchase price is not\ndamage caused by the failure to release the earnest *681 money, but by the failure to close on\nthe real estate transaction.\n\nThus, we conclude that, because the contract provision simply takes the value of the earnest money,\nwhich the parties have agreed represents the actual damages caused by the breach of the agreement,\nand multiplies it times three if there is an additional breach of the obligation to turn over the earnest\nmoney, the provision is an unlawful penalty and does not attempt to forecast actual damages. This\nconclusion is supported by the comment promulgated by the Texas Real Estate Commission when\nit drafted the form upon which the clause is based, wherein the Commission stated that the purpose\nof the clause was to “provide for additional incentives for prompt release of the earnest money.”\n31 Tex. Reg. 1446, Comment on Amendment to 22 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 537.28 (2008) (Tex.\nReal Estate Comm'n) (Standard Contract Form TREC No. 20–7).\n\nWe are not holding, however, that a contract can never provide liquidated damages for the failure\nto release earnest money. We hold only that the clause in this case, on its face, did not attempt to\nreasonably forecast a just compensation for a breach of the agreement to release the earnest money.\n\nAccordingly, we sustain issue two.\n\n\n\n                                 SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\nIn issue three, the Magills contend the trial court erred in denying their motion for directed verdict\nbecause there was no evidence that they wrongfully failed or refused to sign a release of the earnest\nmoney.\n\n [20] [21] [22] A complaint about the denial of a motion for directed verdict is the same as\na challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence.

However, to the extent that the Magills\nare also contesting the jury's finding them liable for breaching the agreement, we note that there is\nevidence that the Magills could have built a 5000 square foot house on the lot, but chose instead\nto terminate the contract because they could not get a variance to permit them to build their garage\nso that it encroached on the setback. Thus, the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury's\nfinding that the Magill's breached the agreement, thus giving rise to damages in the amount of\nthe earnest money.\n\nWe overrule issue three.\n\n\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n\nBecause section 18.D of the contract imposed an unlawful penalty, the trial court *682 erred by\nawarding three times the earnest money, in addition to the earnest money, plus attorney's fees,\ninterest, and costs. However, the evidence is legally sufficient to support an award of liquidated\ndamages in the amount of the earnest money, plus attorney's fees, interest, and costs. Therefore, we\nreverse the judgment awarding the trustees “actual damages of $32,000.00, together with interest\nthereon at the rate of 6% per annum” and render judgment awarding the trustees “actual damages\nof $8,000.00, together with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum.” We affirm the remaining\nportions of the judgment.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                         © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The trial judge, acting on the provisions of an alleged liquidated\ndamage clause in each lease, granted a default judgment in favor of Dave Hicks Company against\nFour C Corporation for $289,401.08, plus $15,000 in attorneys' fees and also granted a default\njudgment in favor of Dave Hicks, individually, against Four C Corporation for $20,765.51 and\nattorneys' fees of $2,500. 1 Both plaintiffs were then granted an instructed verdict against the\nguarantors.\n\nOnly the guarantors appeal from the trial court's judgment asserting, among other grounds, certain\ndefenses to the leases that go to the question of the liability of Four C *574 Corporation on\nthe leases. In response, appellees argue that guarantor-appellants are collaterally estopped from\nasserting any defenses going to questions relating to the liability of the primary obligor, Four C,\nor to the extent of that liability, since the judgment against Four C is now final. Additionally,\nguarantor-appellants contend that the guaranties were ambiguous, that consideration for the\nguaranties had failed, that attorneys' fees were not recoverable under the guaranties, that all offsets\nand credits had not been allowed them, and that the liquidated damage provision of the lease\nwas a penalty. With respect to the defenses to the leases, we hold that these guarantors are not\ncollaterally estopped and, thus they may assert all defenses available to the primary obligor. We\nalso hold that the “liquidated damage” provision of the lease is a penalty rather than a provision for\njust compensation. Accordingly, we reverse and remand so that appellees may prove their actual\ndamages.\n\n\n                                           Collateral Estoppel\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Appellees argue that the trial court properly instructed a verdict for\nthe appellees because the liability of the primary obligor on the leases had been finally determined\nby the default judgments and that the appellants, as guarantors, are collaterally estopped from\nasserting any defenses to the liability of the primary obligor, Four C Corporation, under the leases.\nIn this respect, they contend that since the judgment is final as to Four C, the rule applies that a\njudgment against the principal obligor conclusively establishes the extent of the principal's liability\nwith respect to a guarantor, if that judgment is obtained in a suit of which the guarantor had full\nknowledge and an opportunity to defend, citing R.

Bank of Miami, supra, and subsequently attempted to attack that judgment in a\nlater action by the obligee against the guarantor. It is only in this situation that courts have applied\ncollateral estoppel. Here, the guarantors attempted to assert the defenses available to their principal\nin the trial court rather than consciously ignore the opportunity to present such defenses. There\nwas no other opportunity to defend because there had been no prior action. Thus, the general rule\nthat guarantors have the right to raise any defenses to the guaranteed obligation that the principal\nmay have applies. Accordingly, we hold that where a guarantor has notice of the action against his\nprincipal and he takes part in the suit, he is not bound by the adjudication of the principal's liability\nby a default judgment against his principal in the same action. This is true because the guarantor\nmay have had no authority to answer in the principal's behalf or to defend in the name of his\nprincipal. Indeed, before collateral estoppel applies, the opportunity to defend must be such that\nthe guarantor can actually control the suit with respect to any defenses including those available\nto the primary obligor.

Thus, where the guarantor is merely given notice that the primary obligor expects\nthe guarantor “to assist” in the conduct of the defense, it is insufficient notice or control so as to\npreclude the guarantor from asserting the same defenses in a subsequent suit or in the same suit.\n1 Freeman on Judgments s 449, at 984-85 *575 (5th ed. 1925). Accordingly, we must now turn\nto all points of error asserted by appellants.\n\n\n\n                                       Liquidated Damages or Penalty\n\n [7] Appellants contend that the clauses in both leases which entitle the lessor to repossess the\nequipment and sue for unpaid rentals is an unenforceable penalty, and thus no basis for appellees'\nactual damages. The lessors argue, however, that the provision is a valid stipulation of liquidated\ndamages, for which the lessee became liable upon default. We agree with appellants that the\nprovision is a penalty rather than a liquidated damage provision and that the question of actual\ndamages should be submitted to the jury. The provision in each lease provides:\n         Upon the occurrence of an event of Default, and at any time thereafter, Lessor,\n         in addition to any other rights and remedies he may have, Shall have the right\n         to . . .

(Emphasis added)\n\n\nThe vice in this provision that makes it a penalty rather than a liquidated damage provision is that\nupon the occurrence of even a minor default by the lessee, the lessor may then declare the lessee in\ndefault, take possession of the equipment, and, in addition, demand payment of all lease payments\ncalled for in the lease. The coupling of repossession with acceleration of rent, irrespective of\nthe type of breach, is the defect in this provision. It is immaterial that the actual breach was for\nnonpayment of rentals. A provision is a penalty if it provides for unreasonable payments for a\nminor breach. For example, the leases here provide that an event of default occurs if the lessee\ndoes not punctually perform any of the obligations contained in the leases and the leases obligate\nthe lessee to keep the equipment in good appearance. Conceivably, if the lessee did not punctually\nkeep the equipment in good appearance, then the lessor could declare the lessee to be in default.\nSuch a minor breach could then lead to draconian penalties disproportionate to any actual damage\nthat the lessors may suffer.

Consequently, that court concluded that the provision in that case to be a penalty\nrather than a provision for liquidated damages.

Of course, it would be unreasonable to permit the lessor to repossess\nand to require the lessee or its guarantors to pay the entire rentals set forth in the lease for *576\nany insignificant, technical breach. Thus, the question of whether the provision is a penalty or a\nliquidated damage clause is determined by the reasonableness of the provision with respect to just\ncompensation.

They assert that although the lease obligated Four C\nCorporation to pay attorneys' fees, since the guaranty agreement does not expressly provide for\nattorneys' fees, the guarantor is not liable for them, citing Miller v. Bush, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3922430\"><a href=\"/opinion/4157028/miller-v-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 159\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Waco 1931, writ ref'd). Miller is not, however, controlling because in that case\nthe attorneys' fees were not allowed because neither the guaranty nor the obligation guaranteed\nprovided for attorneys' fees. Consequently, that court applied the rule that guarantors are not liable\nfor attorneys' fees, unless they are provided for in the contract guaranteed, or, if that contract is\nsilent with respect to attorneys' fees, unless the guaranty so provides. In this case the contract\nguaranteed expressly provides for attorneys' fees and the guaranty agreement specifically binds\nthe guarantor to pay all indebtedness incurred by the lessor by reason of the lessor's default.\nThis, of course, includes attorneys' fees incurred in asserting the rights of the obligee. Since the\nlease agreements provide for attorneys' fees against the principal obligor, and since the guaranties\ncover any and all indebtedness that the primary obligor may owe, the attorneys' fees are included\nas a part of the guaranteed debt.

This appellants have failed to do.\n\n [15] [16] Finally, appellants urge that since there were questions of fact as to whether the lease\nagreements and guaranties were executed several months apart, consideration for the leases cannot\nserve as consideration for the guaranties. One guaranty shows that it was executed six days after\nthe lease; however, the date on the other guaranty was identical to the date of the lease. Some\ntestimony was to the effect that some of the guarantors actually signed the guaranties as long as\nseveral months after the lease. The evidence is, however, undisputed that the guarantors would\nexecute the guaranties and that without the guaranties the lessors would not furnish the equipment.\nWe conclude that appellants' contention lacks merit.

In rejecting this\ncontention, we stated that this apparent discrepancy did not refute the presumption of consideration\ninherent in the guaranty agreement, and, therefore, held that:\n         (M)ere evidence of a time discrepancy in execution between a note and a written\n         guaranty agreement is legally insufficient to rebut the statutory presumption of\n         consideration which supports a separate guaranty accord.\n\n\n *578 Thus, the mere fact that a guaranty agreement was executed subsequent to the passing of\nconsideration for the principal obligation does not rebut the statutory presumption of consideration\nnor does it shift the burden of proof to the plaintiffs to show additional consideration.\n\n\n\n                                                Ambiguity\n\n [17] [18] Finally, appellants argue that the trial court erred in refusing to submit issues to the jury\nwith respect to their allegation that the guaranties are ambiguous and further, that the trial court\nerred in determining as a matter of law that the guaranties were not ambiguous. Appellants urge\nthat the guaranties are ambiguous because the agreements provide in one part that all guarantors\nare “jointly and severally” liable and that they bind themselves to pay “any and all indebtedness”\nwhich would indicate a general liability of each signer for the total indebtedness as set out in the\nequipment leases, and then the same instrument later provides that “the undersigned shall not be\nrequired to pay the lessor hereunder more than the sum set out adjacent to the undersigned names.”\nThus, appellants contend that on the face of the instrument it calls for two different liabilities. We\ncannot agree. First, it was not error for the trial judge to refuse to submit issues on the alleged\nambiguity of the guaranties because the question of whether a written agreement is ambiguous\nis a question of law for the court, rather than for a jury question.

As exhibits to its petition, Cintas attached the\ncontracts, the invoices and Cintas's affidavit stating that the claim against Murphy was just and\ntrue, that it was due, and that all just and lawful credit had been allowed.

After a non-jury hearing, the court\nrendered judgment in favor of Cintas. Neither party requested findings of fact and conclusions\nof law.\n\nIn points one, two, three, four, five, six and eight, Murphy challenges the legal sufficiency of the\nevidence to support the court's award of liquidated damages. According to Murphy, the record\nis void of any evidence regarding the amount of monetary loss that Cintas actually suffered as a\nresult of the breach or the reasonableness of the liquidated damage provision. He also argues that\nthe record is void of any evidence that the amount of liquidated damages was a reasonable forecast\nof just compensation.

Murphy also contends that the harm caused by the breach\nmust not be capable of estimation or difficult to estimate to be an enforceable liquidated damage\nstipulation. Because employees of Cintas testified that documentation of the actual damage that\nCintas incurred as a result of the breach were available at the time of trial, Murphy concludes that\nCintas admitted that the liquidated damage provision was unenforceable.\n\nIn Stewart v. Basey, the Supreme Court considered the difference between an enforceable\nliquidated damage provision and an unenforceable penalty. Stewart v.

More recently, the courts have restated this two-part Stewart test when\nanalyzing the validity of a contractual damages provision:\n\n  In order to enforce a liquidated damage clause, the court must find:\n\n  (1) that the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation; and\n\n  (2) that the amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just\n     compensation.\n\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. For the provision to be an unenforceable penalty, the uncertainty of the\ndamages and the reasonableness of the stipulation must have existed at the time when the contract\nwas executed. Oetting v.

Baker Corporation\nfailed to pay its monthly obligation and Flake Uniform obtained judgment for liquidated damages.\nOetting appeals on the ground the contract provision for liquidated damages is unenforceable\nbecause it provides for a penalty.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n *795 This suit originally was brought by Flake Uniform against The Baker Corporation, and\nHoward W. Oetting, Tommy Baker and Maurice Baker, individually. The Baker Corporation\nbecame insolvent and ceased doing business and the plaintiff was unable to serve either of the two\nBakers who were dismissed from the suit. Baker Corporation as customer and Flake Uniform as\nsupplier entered into an original garment rental contract on March 13, 1972, and a second contract\ndated February 10, 1975. In June, 1975, the parties entered into an amendment to the garment\nrental contract and a guaranty agreement. In summary form, the guaranty agreement recited that\nBaker Corporation was in default in various sums of money under the terms of existing contracts.\nThe parties agreed to the amount of these obligations and that such indebtedness had matured and\nalso agreed to pay attorney fees but provided that these past due installments should be paid in\nsix monthly installments.\n\nThe other parties to the suit guaranteed the payment of these obligations. A third cause of action\nwas for the payment of various checks that had been paid for this service which had been\ndishonored by the bank. The fourth cause of action was for the sum of $15,495.66 as liquidated\ndamages for the loss of profits for the balance of the term of the rental agreement. The fifth cause\nof action was for the failure to return to plaintiff uniforms that had been supplied to The Baker\nCorporation, and the sixth cause of action was for attorney fees as provided for in the contracts.\n\nAfter Oetting had been served and answered, Flake Uniform filed detailed request for admissions\ncovering the entire transactions in all the matters in controversy and included in said request for\nadmissions a request that Oetting admit the allegations of fact in each paragraph of plaintiff's\npetition. These were each by separate request.\n\nOetting did not answer the request for admissions and a motion was filed for an order deeming\nthe request for admissions to be admitted. This was not contested and the court rendered judgment\nand signed an order deeming admitted all the request for admissions and allegations contained in\nplaintiff's trial pleadings.\n\nFlake Uniform filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The court granted this summary\njudgment for all sums of money due under the contracts and for services that had theretofore been\nrendered. This was in the sum of $4,860.77.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 2\n\fOetting v.

There is no provision\nallowing termination of the contract, except in paragraph A, in the case of breach by failure to pay.\nTherefore, the liquidated damage provision can only come into play if: (1) the customer fails to\npay as agreed; and (2) the supplier terminates the contract.\n\n\nIt is true that paragraph D also recites “. . . or by reason of any other breach on the part of\nCustomer, . . .” but that appears to have been inserted in an abundance of caution, since termination\nmust occur, and can only occur on nonpayment.

He had a vast stock\nof used uniforms which he valued at 5¢ each. He attempted to replace worn uniforms with used\nclothing but, if he could not, the new ones cost approximately $12.50 each. These uniforms were\npicked up by a route man and the laundry was done in lots so that each driver's entire pickup\nload of clothing was washed in one machine, no matter what size the load. Flake operated several\ncompanies, including a chemical company and unrelated businesses, out of his central place of\nbusiness. His route man serviced an account across the street from Flake Uniform. His route\nmen were on salary. His bookkeeping was done by salaried personnel for this business and other\nunrelated businesses. Their salary remained the same after the Baker account was terminated.\nThere was no difference in his cost of operation or his overhead after the Baker account was\nterminated. The major cost was a “front-end” cost, in that the uniforms were purchased and sized;\nthe emblems and advertisement were purchased and placed thereon; the collars and waistbands\nwere taped for identification; and the salesmen were paid a commission when the contracts were\nobtained.\n\nFlake further testified that the fact that The Baker Corporation dropped out didn't cause his cost\nto go down any. “My revenue just ceased . . . from that particular account.”\n\nUnder the facts in this case it would be very difficult to determine in advance what actual damages\nwould be sustained as a result of Baker Corporation's failing to pay its rental contract and the\ncontract then having to be terminated.\n\nWe have examined with care the cases cited in support of the contentions made by Oetting. In\neach instance, we concluded that the authorities relied upon by Oetting are distinguishable from\nthe cases we consider controlling.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

When they\ndivorced, rather than break up their oil and gas holdings, they created Phillips & Phillips, Ltd., a\nlimited partnership, and transferred the bulk of their assets to it. Each had an equal interest in the\npartnership. Harry, the only general partner, agreed to work for the partnership full-time without\nsalary and to offer Martha the option to participate in any business opportunities he pursued outside\nthe partnership. Martha, the only limited partner, agreed that she would have no right to participate\nin Harry's business decisions for the partnership and that she would leave each of her four children\nby Harry at least one-sixth of her estate.\n\nThe partnership agreement required Harry to pay himself and Martha each a minimum *787 of\n$21,000 per month for 24 months, and then minimum monthly distributions adjusted for inflation\nand for oil and gas prices. It also required Harry to furnish Martha certain financial information\nabout the partnership and to cooperate with her in auditing its affairs. The agreement contained\nthe following provision: “If the general partner breaches his trust hereunder, he shall pay to the\nlimited partner as liquidated damages ten times the amount she loses as a result of such breaches\nof trust. Errors of judgment shall not be considered breaches of trusts.”\n\nThe value of the partnership increased under Harry's management, but Harry did not fully comply\nwith the terms of the written agreement. In particular, after the first 20 months Harry distributed\nmuch less than the required minimum amounts, never actually calculating what payments the\nagreement required. He also failed to provide timely annual statements of operations and refused\nto cooperate fully with Martha's attempts to audit the partnership.\n\nMartha eventually sued Harry for dissolution of the partnership and damages based upon Harry's\nbreach of contractual and fiduciary duties. The case was tried to a jury, who found that Harry\nbreached the partnership agreement by favoring himself in paying his personal expenses and\nencumbering partnership assets, thus endangering partnership distributions. The jury also found\nthat Harry breached both the partnership agreement and his fiduciary duty to Martha by failing to\nkeep current and complete partnership books, failing to prepare required annual statements, and\ninterfering with Martha's efforts to examine partnership books and records. 1 The jury assessed\nMartha's actual damages at $300,000. None of the jury's findings are challenged by the parties\non appeal.\n\nDuring the trial the parties stipulated that a reasonable fee for legal services necessary for Martha's\nprosecution of the case was $235,302.14. The jury was aware of this stipulation, and the trial court\nsurmised that the jury included this amount in its $300,000 finding. Accordingly, the trial court\nrendered judgment for Martha for a total of $300,000, $235,302.14 against the partnership and\n$64,697.86 against Harry, and refused to award Martha any additional amount for attorney fees.\nThe trial court also ordered the partnership dissolved.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court of appeals held that the trial court erred in refusing to\naward Martha the $235,302.14 stipulated attorney fees in addition to the $300,000 damages found\nby the jury, but that the trial court did not err in refusing to award Martha decuple damages under\nthe partnership agreement. Consequently, the appeals court reversed the judgment of the trial court\nin part and rendered judgment against Harry for a total of $535,302.14, plus interest. 2\n\n *788 Martha contends that she is entitled to recover liquidated damages equal to ten times\nthe actual damages found by the jury, as provided by the limited partnership agreement. Harry\ncontends that the contractual provision is not an enforceable agreement for liquidated damages but\nan unenforceable penalty. Martha argues that even if Harry is correct, he has waived any defense\nof penalty by failing to plead it as an affirmative defense.\n\n [1] We first considered the difference between an enforceable liquidated damages provision and\nan unenforceable penalty in Stewart v. Basey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1507983\"><a href=\"/opinion/1507983/stewart-v-basey/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485–486 (1952).\nThere we explained:\n\n   Volumes have been written on the question of when a stipulated damage provision of a contract\n   should be enforced as liquidated damages and when enforcement should be denied because it is\n   a penalty provision.... All agree that to be enforceable as liquidated damages the damages must\n   be uncertain and the stipulation must be reasonable.\n\n.....\n\n   The right of competent parties to make their own bargains is not unlimited. The universal rule\n   for measuring damages for the breach of a contract is just compensation for the loss or damage\n   actually sustained. By the operation of that rule a party generally should be awarded neither\n   less nor more than his actual damages. A party has no right to have a court enforce a stipulation\n   which violates the principle underlying that rule.\n\nMore recently, in Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers, Inc. v.

The\nprovision assumes actual damages can and will be determined, indeed must be determined, before\nthe prescribed multiplier can be applied.

This holding resurrects trial by ambush and\nrejects the notion that parties are entitled to know what theories of law they will face at trial. I would\nhold that by failing to plead it, Mr. Phillips waived his right to assert that the contract he entered\ninto with his wife is unenforceable. Furthermore, since Mr. Phillips waived the penalty defense by\nfailing to affirmatively plead it, I would not reach the question of whether the contractual provision\nin question is, on its face, an unenforceable penalty. I thus would reverse the judgment of the\ncourt of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for entry of a judgment that enforces the\nprovision.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Phillips were married for 32 years prior to getting a divorce. With the assistance of\ncounsel, they entered into a pre-divorce agreement, whereby they transferred about $18 million\nof their assets into a partnership which Mr. Phillips would manage. Mr. Phillips in effect said to\nhis soon-to-be ex-wife: “Trust me.” As a disincentive to cheating or short changing Mrs. Phillips,\nMr. Phillips pledged that he would pay her 10 times the amount of the losses if he violated the\ncontract. 1 The agreement also recited that Mr. Phillips owed Mrs. Phillips a fiduciary duty, a\nhigher standard of care than normally exists between parties to a contract. 2\n\nEight years later, Mrs. Phillips sued Mr. Phillips, alleging that he violated the agreement. *791\nMr. Phillips entered a general denial and asserted the affirmative defenses of limitations, laches,\nand equitable estoppel. In a unanimous verdict, the jury found that Mr. Phillips breached the\nagreement by interfering with Mrs. Phillips right to examine the books and records of the\npartnership, and by willfully underpaying Mrs. Phillips and overpaying himself.\n\n\n\n                                          AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\nRule 94 enumerates specific affirmative defenses which are waived if not pleaded, such as accord\nand satisfaction, arbitration and award, fraud, illegality, statute of frauds, statute of limitations,\n“and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.” TEX.R.CIV.P. 94.

In other words, if the defendant asserts facts that defeat in whole or in\npart the plaintiff's claim, such assertion amounts to an affirmative defense that must be pleaded\nor it is waived. “Penalty” is a classic affirmative defense; in my view, it clearly falls within the\npurview of Rule 94.\n\nThe majority implies that as long as the issue does not depend upon evidence or findings, no\npurpose is served by requiring that it be specifically pleaded. But there is a valid purpose to serve,\nnamely, the need for notice and fair play, so as to avoid trials by ambush.\n\nThe court refers to Lewkowicz v.

That case is distinguishable because it involved the defense of illegality of\ncontract. The defense of illegality is a special situation and a poor choice from which to draw a rule\nof general applicability.

That is, courts should not have to validate\ncontracts that are illegal on their face merely because a defendant has failed to plead illegality.\n\nHere, the court seems to be saying that pleading and proof are not necessary, because the issue\nof whether the liquidated damages provision is a penalty is a question of law. In some contracts\nit may be possible to determine from their four corners that they impose a penalty.

In my view, this is a retreat from this\ncourt's recent trend towards encouraging full disclosure during discovery of all witnesses, facts and\nlegal theories upon which a party intends to rely at trial. This trend not only encourages litigants\nto be well prepared for trial, but also enables disputes to be resolved on their true merits and\nnot on “mere technicalities.” It makes no sense to me to subject parties to a severe sanction for\nfailing to disclose witnesses or to supplement discovery responses, but not require them to plead\nthe legal theory upon which they intend to rely to defeat their opponent's claim. The majority has\ncreated an exception to Rule 94 that has a visceral appeal, but collapses on its own logic. The court\nsays that the contractual provision in issue is a penalty as a matter of law, and thus need not be\npleaded (and can be asserted as a defense for the first time on appeal). But a defendant likewise\nmay defeat a contract claim under a statute of limitations defense. And while the defendant may\nbe entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, we nevertheless require affirmative pleading of the\nstatute of limitations defense. The court ultimately rationalizes its de facto modification of Rule\n94 by relying on the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356 to assert that public\npolicy demands the result. The court expands the public policy exception to Rule 94's pleading\nrequirement beyond the exception for illegal contracts to include contracts that allegedly impose\na penalty. This is a faulty rationale. First, this is not a case where pure contract principles apply.\nMr. Phillips agreed to a higher standard of care (namely, a fiduciary's standard) than he normally\nwould have owed Mrs. Phillips in a standard contractual relationship. Courts impose damages on\nparties who violate a fiduciary duty in order to punish the party's breach of trust. I agree with the\nRestatement § 356's directive that the “central objective behind the system of contract remedies is\ncompensatory, not punitive.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356 comment a\n(1979). But Mr. Phillips entered into this agreement with his eyes open, accepting a higher than\nnormal standard of care and devising and adopting a measure of damages for his breach of that\nstandard. I do not see how the it advances the best interest of the public to bail him out of his\nbargain. I would hold that penalty is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded and that Mr.\nPhillips waived this defense by failing to plead it. For the above reasons, I dissent.\n\n\n\nMAUZY and DOGGETT, JJ., join this opinion.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

However plausible Harry's explanation of the jury's reasoning\n          process may be, it cannot substitute for the jury's finding. What the jury found, not why the jury found it, is the relevant inquiry\n          absent jury misconduct. First Nat'l Bank v.

Thus, we conclude that the court of appeals\n          was correct in rendering judgment against Harry for the actual damages found by the jury plus stipulated attorney fees.\n          Harry also complains of the court of appeals' judgment that he, rather than the partnership, pay Martha's attorney fees.

Conrad Moore & Associates, Inc. (Appellant)\nentered into an earnest money contract for the purchase of two lots at 1900 Gus Moran in El Paso.\nThe Lermas tendered a check to Moore for $13,500 as part of the earnest money contract. The\nsale of the lots was contingent upon the Lermas using Moore as a builder. On April 16, 1990,\nthen Lermas and Moore incorporated the previous contract into a new home residential earnest\nmoney contract. This contract provided for the construction of a custom home on the lots for a\ntotal price, including the lots, of $180,000. The new contract called for an additional payment\nof $6,500 earnest money, due upon the Lermas' approval of the house plan. Paragraph 4 of the\ncontract required the following:\n\n            FINANCING CONDITIONS: This contract is subject to approval for Buyer of\n            a conventional (type of loan) loan (the Loan) to be evidenced by a promissory\n            note (the Note) in the amount of $ 80,000,.... Buyer shall apply for the Loan\n            within 15 days from the effective date of this contract and shall make every\n            reasonable effort to obtain approval from Competitive Mortgage Co., as lender,\n            or any lender that will make the Loan.... If the Loan cannot be approved within\n            60 days from the effective date of this contract, this contract shall terminate\n            and the Earnest Money shall be refunded to Buyer without delay. [Emphasis\n            added.]\n\nIn addition to the standard provision of the preprinted contract, special handwritten provisions\nwere included under Paragraph 11:\n\n  1) Seller give One Year (1) Builders Warranty and 10–Year H.O.W. warranty\n\n  2) On Lot held more than 60 days, Earnest Money is non-refundable.\n\n  3) Lot purchase contract dated January 30, 1990 is hereby transferred to this Home construction\n  contract.\n\n  4) * Balance of Down Payment to be made at time of sale of properties located at 1400 Bodega\n  and 3509 Breckenridge. [Emphasis added.]\n\nConstruction on the house began in December 1990, and was completed in the summer of 1991.\nThe Lermas were ultimately denied credit and were unable to close on the house. In September\n1991, after demanding the return of their earnest money, they initiated this suit in November 1992.\nAfter trial to a jury, the Lermas were awarded $20,000 in damages. The jury found that Moore\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 2\n\fR. Conrad Moore & Associates, Inc. v.

Intentional\nrelinquishment of a known right can be inferred from intentional conduct which is inconsistent\nwith claiming the contractual right. Id.\n\n [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] It has been conclusively established that the Lermas did not obtain\nfinancing for the purchase of the house from Moore. Paragraph 4 of the contract clearly states that\nif the purchasers are unable to obtain financing within 60 days of the effective date of the contract,\nthey had a right to have their money returned. Thus, on June 15, 1990, the Lermas had a right to\nthe return of their earnest money. The Lermas' intention to relinquish their right to the return of the\nearnest money, however, is clearly established by their conduct after June 15. Between the date\nthe contract was signed and the date construction began on the house, the Lermas participated in\nthe design of the house, approved the blueprints in July 1990, and tendered an additional $6,500\nin earnest money to Moore in October. The Lermas were then conditionally approved for *94\nfinancing which allowed Moore to get a construction loan to begin building the house.\n\nAdditionally, after construction of the house began in December 1990, the Lermas monitored its\nprogress on a daily basis. In March 1991, they requested and paid for an upgrade in tile for the\nhouse. In June, Isabel Lerma executed a promissory note in the principal amount of $6,000 to\nMoore to pay for the addition of another room to the house. During this same time period, the\nLermas sold their home and another property, as agreed in the contract, to fund the down payment.\nMr. Lerma testified that he fully intended to buy the house that Moore was building, and at no\ntime prior to August 1991 did he consider the contract terminated. Mrs. Lerma also testified that\nuntil August 1991, they wanted and intended to purchase the home.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

There is no evidence of fraud, actual or constructive, on the part of Moore.\nThus, we conclude the Lermas had knowledge of their right to a refund of the earnest money on\nJune 15.\n\nThere is no evidence to support the jury's finding that the Lermas did not waive the right to have\nthe earnest money refunded. The Lermas' intentional conduct after the right to the return of the\nearnest money arose was inconsistent with claiming that right. They intentionally relinquished a\nknown right, and therefore, we find as a matter of law, that the Lermas waived Paragraph 4 of the\ncontract, and the contract continued in effect, including Paragraph 11 allowing Moore to retain\nthe earnest money on the lots.\n\nThe Lermas argue that Paragraph 4 operates as a condition precedent. When the Lermas failed\nto obtain financing within 60 days, the contract, including any forfeiture provisions, terminated.\nThus, the Lermas assert Paragraphs 16 and 11 never became effective.

This requires the court to examine and consider the entire instrument and\nreach a decision so that none of the provisions will be rendered meaningless. Id.\n\nBy its wording, Paragraph 11 is not merely a forfeiture clause subject to the condition precedent\nstated in Paragraph 4. Paragraph 11 envisions the non-occurrence of the condition (in this case\nfinancing obtained within 60 days), references the 60–day provision, and provides for continuation\nof the contract beyond 60 days. To give effect to both provisions and render neither meaningless,\nwe must construe the handwritten provision to allow the buyer, at its option, to continue the\ncontract after 60 days in the absence of financing. A condition precedent like any other provision\nof a contract can be waived. Purvis Oil Corp., 890 S.W.2d at 931. Thus, if financing were not\nobtained in 60 days, the Lermas could do nothing, the contract would terminate, and the Lermas\nwould be entitled to return of the earnest money. On the other hand, the Lermas could take action to\nhave the lot “held more than 60 days” thereby waiving the right to the return of the earnest money.\n\nThe record establishes that the Lermas chose the latter option. They worked with Moore on the\ndesign of the house, tendered additional earnest money four months after the contract would have\nexpired under Paragraph 4, contracted with Moore to increase the square footage of the house, paid\nfor tile upgrades, and sold both the home they were living in and another property in anticipation\nof closing on the house when it was completed. The record therefore conclusively establishes that\nthe Lermas waived termination of the contract and instead continued to operate pursuant to the\ncontract under Paragraph 11.\n\n [12] [13] The Lermas further assert that even if we find waiver of Paragraph 4, Paragraph 11\nis unenforceable as a penalty. The Lermas characterize Paragraph 11 as an attempted liquidated\ndamages clause. Under Texas law, a liquidated damages provision will be enforced only if the court\nfinds (1) the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) the amount\nof liquidated damages is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.

Although they requested a trial amendment, the trial court denied the amendment\nand the Lermas do not attack that ruling on appeal. Further, the Lermas did not request, or object\nto the absence of, a jury question or instruction on the elements of penalty.\n\n [14] The Lermas suggest that a jury question was unnecessary because whether a contractual\nprovision is an enforceable liquidated damages provision or an unenforceable penalty is a question\nof law for the court. They argue that the trial court in this case implicitly found Paragraph 11\nan unenforceable penalty as a matter of law when it entered judgment in favor of the Lermas.\nWhile the determination between an unenforceable penalty and an enforceable liquidated damages\nprovision is generally a question of law for the court, sometimes the factual underpinnings of\nthe elements must be resolved before the legal question can be decided.

This is such a case. The amount the Lermas paid in earnest money\nis not, on its face, necessarily disproportionate to actual damages Moore allegedly suffered as the\nresult of the Lermas' failure *96 to purchase the custom built home. Thus, at least the fact of\nMoore's actual damages should have been determined by a jury before the trial court could consider\nwhether the liquidated damages were a reasonable forecast of just compensation. See Phillips, 820\nS.W.2d at 788–89. Even if fact issues did not exist in this particular context, we do not find that\nthe trial court's entry of judgment implicates the penalty issue in any way. The trial court entered\njudgment on jury findings that the Lermas did not obtain financing by the deadline provided in\nParagraph 4, and that the Lermas did not waive their right to return of the earnest money. An\ninterpretation of Paragraph 11 is unnecessary to those particular jury findings. Moreover, we are\nhard pressed to find that the trial court “implicitly” found Paragraph 11 unenforceable as a penalty\nwhen it had refused to allow the Lermas to plead penalty by trial amendment.\n\nWe must reject the Lermas' arguments and affirm Moore's second point of error.\n\n\n\n                                          Moore's Attorney's Fees\n\n [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] In its eleventh and twelfth points, Moore alleges error in the trial\ncourt's failure to allow evidence of, and award, Moore's attorney's fees. Moore argues that the\nearnest money contract provided for attorney's fees to the prevailing party in the event of litigation.\nWe find, however, that Moore failed to plead for attorney's fees.

Section 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides for\nrecovery of attorney's fees in addition to the amount of a valid claim for an oral or written contract.\nTEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 38.001 (Vernon 1986). The contract in this case entitled\nthe prevailing party in any legal proceeding to attorney's fees from the non-prevailing party. We\nhave found, however, that the Lermas should not prevail on their causes of action. Accordingly,\nwe overrule the Lermas' first cross-point.\n\n\nRecovery Under Unjust Enrichment\n [20] [21] [22] In their second cross-point, the Lermas argue that even if we find they cannot\nprevail on their contract cause of action, they can recover under an unjust enrichment theory. In\naddition to the contract claim, the jury also found in favor of the Lermas on their unjust enrichment\ncause of action. The unjust enrichment doctrine applies the principles of restitution to disputes\nwhich for one reason or another are not governed by a contract between the contending parties.\nBurlington Northern R.

CSG\nresponded to Southern Union's request in February 2000. Southern Union selected CSG's bid from\nthe field of candidates, and the two companies engaged in formal negotiations from April until\nSeptember.\n\nA contract was finalized and signed by representatives from both Southern Union and CSG as of\nOctober 13, 2000. The contract contained a “discontinuance fee” provision, obligating Southern\nUnion to pay a specified amount of damages to CSG in the event that Southern Union terminated\nthe agreement before its five-year term expired. The parties agree that the provision was intended\nas a liquidated damages provision.\n\nAfter the contract was finalized, CSG provided Southern Union with a written project plan\ncontemplating December 1, 2000 as the date for CSG to “go live” with the print-and-mail\noperations. In the months leading up to that deadline, implementation problems arose on both sides\nand the conversion fell behind schedule. The companies continued discussions in an attempt to\nsolve the problems until the first week of January 2001, when Southern Union ceased work on the\nproject. Southern Union filed suit against CSG on February 7, asserting breach of contract among\nother causes of action.\n\nIn its verdict, the jury found that Southern Union and CSG were both in breach of the agreement,\nbut that CSG's breach was excused, and that CSG would be fairly and reasonably compensated by\nan award of $2.1 million for the discontinuance fee; $111,000 for the cost of paper and envelopes\npurchased by CSG; $1,045,944 for CSG's lost profits; and $140,000 for the cost of software\nlicenses provided by CSG to Southern Union. Beneath the last element of damages, the jury wrote\n“upon return of 300 licenses to CSG, the answer would be $0.”The trial court determined that, as a\nmatter of law, it was proper to award liquidated damages in lieu of actual damages, and therefore\nentered a final judgment in conformance with the jury's verdict, for a total amount of $2,351,000,\nplus interest and attorney's fees.\n\n\n\n                                                 ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Southern Union\nfirst asserts that, based on the timing of its breach, the proper calculation of the fee results in a zero\nsum. Alternatively, Southern Union asserts that even if the proper calculation is $2.1 million, CSG\nis not entitled to recover the award because that amount constitutes an illegal penalty.

The parties disagree, however, on how to determine one factor of this\nequation: the Subscriber Statement Minimum. Southern Union asserts that, pursuant to Schedule\nC, the minimum does not accrue until after the “commencement date.” 3 Because Southern Union\nbreached this agreement prior to the commencement date, 4 it claims that the minimum was zero,\nand that the total calculation should therefore be zero.\n\nCSG interprets the provision to mean that, although Schedule C prevents Southern Union from\nhaving to pay the monthly minimum until after the commencement date, that time restriction\ndoes not apply to Southern Union's liability under the discontinuance fee provision. CSG asserts\nthat Southern Union's interpretation is wrong because it allows Southern Union to breach the\ncontract without consequence, so long as it does so within ninety days of the commencement date,\nregardless of the significant time and money invested by CSG during the implementation phase.\nAccording to CSG, the liquidated damages provision is most necessary during this initial time\nperiod because of the parties' unequal contributions and because of the difficulty in calculating\npotential damages before any actual profits have been made.\n\nWe agree with CSG's reading of the contract. Nothing in the provision limits its applicability to a\nbreach occurring after the commencement of services. The provision specifies the circumstances\nin which Southern Union is excused from paying the discontinuance fee, and none impose such\na timing limitation. To the contrary, the provision's express terms state that Southern Union shall\nbe liable for the discontinuance fee, at a rate of fifty percent, should it cause “any termination”\nwithin one year of signing the contract.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Pamela\nVanlandingham, CSG's Senior Vice President and General Manager of the statement processing\ncenter, testified that during November and December, the CSG team “worked around the clock” to\ncomplete the project, which included working “very hard over the holidays,” and that “CSG [had]\nexpended right at 500 to 600 hours” when Southern Union breached the contract. Southern Union\nofficials confirmed that the nature of this contract required front-loaded efforts by CSG and that,\nprior to terminating the agreement, they were aware of the money CSG invested on supplies and\nequipment, and of the hours CSG put toward programming, testing, and implementing the new\nsystem. David Kvapil, the Chief Financial Officer for Southern Union, testified that he knew CSG\nhad worked “well beyond the number of hours they were going to dedicate to the project,” that CSG\nhad provided a “significant batch of bills” to Southern Union for approval, and that CSG had spent\nover $100,000 on envelopes and paper by the end of December 2000. Christine Shores, a business\nanalyst for Southern Union's mail services division, testified that Southern Union approved the\norder for paper and envelopes prior to CSG placing it, and that Southern Union was aware of the\ntime and money spent by CSG in its efforts to commence live operations.\n\n *4 Based on the plain meaning of the provision, as supported by the witnesses' testimony,\nSouthern Union's liability for the discontinuance fee is not limited to a breach occurring after\nthe commencement of live operations. Southern Union is liable under the discontinuance fee for\nits breach of the agreement during the implementation phase. The amount of fair and reasonable\ndamages pursuant to the discontinuance fee was therefore properly calculated by the jury, and\naffirmed by the trial court, as $2.1 million.

Southern Union bases this claim on a “price projection” document prepared\nby CSG before entering the agreement, which anticipated that CSG would earn a total profit\nof $1,045,944 over the five-year term of its contract with Southern Union. Because the jury\nultimately awarded this exact amount to CSG as lost profits, Southern Union argues that CSG was\ncapable of precisely estimating its damages, and therefore the liquidated damages provision is an\nunenforceable penalty from which CSG is not entitled to recover. The record, however, shows\notherwise.\n\nThe language of the discontinuance fee provision supports the trial court's determination that an\naward of liquidated damages was proper because CSG's actual damages were not easy to estimate.\nThe provision expressly states that it was included in the contract “[b]ecause of the difficulty in\nascertaining CSG's actual damages for a termination or other breach of the Agreement,” and that\n“CSG would have been unwilling to provide the Services at the fees set forth in the Agreement” had\nSouthern Union not promised “certainty of revenue” by obligating itself to pay the discontinuance\nfee in the event that it breached the contract. This provision was a bargained-for exchange,\nnegotiated and approved by both companies.\n\n *5 When a provision is mutually bargained for by equally competent parties, we give deference\nto its enforcement. See Shel-al Corp. v. American Nat'l Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"317105\"><a href=\"/opinion/317105/shel-al-corporation-v-american-national-insurance-company-and-exchange/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94 (5th Cir.1974).\nStanley Mayer, Southern Union's Chief Information Officer, testified that the provision's terms\nwere negotiated between attorneys representing both companies. From the face of the contract,\nSouthern Union understood at the time it entered the agreement that CSG's damages would be\ndifficult to estimate and therefore agreed a liquidated damages provision was necessary.\n\n“[T]he fundamental purpose of a valid liquidated damages provision is to provide a reasonable\nmeasure of compensation in the event of a breach where, at the time the provision is agreed\nto the damages are indeterminable or will be otherwise difficult to prove.”24 Williston on\nContracts § 65:3, at 250 (4th ed.2002). It is well established that lost profits can be inherently\ndifficult to estimate. See Texas Inst., Inc. v. Teletron Energy Mgmt., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384880\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384880/texas-instruments-inc-v-teletron-energy-mgt-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n279 (Tex.1994). Frequently, lost profits are too speculative to recover because their calculation\ndepends on “uncertain and changing conditions, such as market fluctuations,” and this uncertainty\nis heightened where no profits have been made at the time the contract is breached. Id. The contract\nreflects that Southern Union and CSG sought to avoid such speculation in agreeing to the liquidated\ndamages provision. The sliding scale of damages recognized the front-loaded value to be provided\nby CSG. As argued by CSG, had there not been a discontinuance fee to rely on, in the event of\na breach by Southern Union-particularly early in the contract term-then CSG would have risked\nbeing unable to recover because of the uncertainty in calculating its lost profits.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The purpose of\nthe document was not to define CSG's potential damages. Rather, as Vanlandingham testified,\nthe projection was an internal tool used by CSG to outline the prices it anticipated charging for\nits print-and-mail services, so that CSG could make an informed bid in response to Southern\nUnion's request for proposal. Vanlandingham also testified that the projection was prepared with a\n“conservative accounting approach to pricing.” CSG excluded several items from its calculations\nbecause, prior to entering the contract, the parties had not assigned a value to these items. This\nincreased the difficulty of estimating damages. CSG's expert confirmed the difficulty of this\nestimation by explaining several different ways that CSG's lost profits could be calculated, with the\nresults ranging between approximately $1 million to $4 million. After hearing this evidence, the\njury determined that $1,045,944 was a reasonable award of lost profits. But their verdict does not\nestablish that the estimation was either an easy or precise one to make. Given the mutually agreed-\nupon terms of the provision, and the evidence in support of its plain meaning, we are unpersuaded\nby Southern Union's assertion that CSG's damages were easy to estimate.\n\n\nReasonable Forecast of Just Compensation\n *6 Southern Union seeks to satisfy the second part of its burden by showing that the\ndiscontinuance fee provision is an unenforceable penalty because the amount awarded to CSG\nas liquidated damages is unreasonable. Southern Union claims that this is established simply by\nthe fact that the $2.1 million awarded to CSG pursuant to the discontinuance fee is double the\namount found by the jury as lost profits. A liquidated damages provision will be considered an\nunenforceable penalty if the amount awarded is so disproportionate to the actual or anticipated\ndamages that it in effect punishes the breach, thereby coercing performance of the contract by\nmaking it too costly to not adhere to its terms. 24 Williston on Contracts § 65:3, at 249 (4th\ned.2002); see also Kothe v.

The trial\ncourt summarily rejected SP Terrace's counterclaims for breach of contract against Meritage.\n\nThe contract called for SP Terrace to file a subdivision plat by December 31, 2005. SP Terrace\nconcedes that it did not meet this deadline. But it argues that the contract extended the deadline, or\nalternatively that its compliance was excused. It claims fact issues exist on its affirmative defenses\nof oral modification, waiver, delay and interference by Meritage, on the amount of attorney's fees,\nand on its counterclaim against Meritage. We conclude that SP Terrace raises a fact issue on the\nissues of waiver and delay, but not as to contract modification or interference. We therefore reverse\nthe trial court's summary judgment and remand the case for trial. We grant rehearing and withdraw\nour opinion and judgment dated May 6, 2010, to address an argument that SP Terrace raises in its\nmotion for rehearing. Our disposition is unchanged.\n\n\n\n                                                 Background\n\nUnderlying Facts\nSP Terrace entered into an earnest money contract with Meritage to develop and sell ninety-six lots\nin a proposed Harris County subdivision. The development plan required small and narrow lots,\nand Meritage was one of a few builders who could construct houses to fit the particular lot sizes.\nThe contract terms required SP Terrace to improve the overall subdivision. In particular, it required\nSP Terrace to file a subdivision plat with Harris County by a December 31, 2005 substantial\ncompletion deadline. After substantial completion, Meritage would then purchase the lots in a\nseries of transactions. The total purchase price was $2,688,000. Meritage deposited ten percent of\nthis price, $268,000, with SP Terrace as earnest money. If SP Terrace did not achieve substantial\ncompletion by December 31, 2005, Meritage could terminate the contract and recover its earnest\nmoney deposit. But, if Meritage delayed SP Terrace's performance of its contractual obligations,\nthe substantial completion deadline would “be extended to the extent of any such delay.”\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meritage asked for changes to the\nplat, and it requested that SP Terrace postpone filing the plat to accommodate those changes. SP\nTerrace agreed, but informed Meritage that a six-month extension of the substantial completion\ndeadline would be necessary to address these and any future changes to the development.\nAccording to Tyler Todd, the president of Tyee Management, SP Terrace's general partner, and\nKelly Smalley, the project manager, the parties orally agreed to extend the substantial completion\ndeadline, and the representatives of Meritage agreed to sign a written extension memorializing the\noral modification. Smalley mailed a written agreement to Meritage before December 31, 2005.\nShe never received a response.\n\nThe parties continued to work together to make changes and improvements to the development into\nearly February 2006. But on February 3, Meritage informed SP Terrace that, due to SP Terrace's\nfailure to meet the substantial completion deadline, Meritage was terminating the contract and\ndemanding the return of its earnest money deposit.\n\n\nProcedural History\nAfter SP Terrace refused to return the earnest money deposit, Meritage sued for breach of contract.\nSP Terrace counterclaimed for breach of contract, alleging that Meritage (1) delayed SP Terrace's\nperformance, (2) failed to cooperate with SP Terrace, and (3) breached their oral agreement to\nextend the substantial completion deadline by six months, all of which entitled SP Terrace to retain\nthe earnest money deposit and recover actual damages in addition to the earnest money it kept.\n\nMeritage moved for traditional and no-evidence summary judgment on its claims against SP\nTerrace and on SP Terrace's counterclaim. Meritage contended that the parties never agreed to\nextend the substantial completion deadline. Meritage argued that SP Terrace's counterclaim failed\nas a matter of law because it did not state a claim for affirmative relief and the liquidated damages\nprovision in the contract precluded SP Terrace from recovering actual damages in excess of\nthe earnest money deposit. Meritage contended that SP Terrace's waiver defense failed because\nMeritage never renounced its right to terminate the contract, and the forty-eight days that had\npassed between the substantial completion deadline and the date Meritage demanded the return of\nits earnest money deposit was not long enough to show that Meritage intended to yield its right to\nterminate. Meritage argued that any oral modification of the contract is unenforceable because it\nmaterially altered the obligations of the underlying written contract. Meritage also noted that SP\nTerrace failed to present any evidence that the amount of liquidated damages was an unreasonable\nforecast of the amount of its damages.\n\nSP Terrace responded with the Todd and Smalley affidavits to show that fact issues existed\nregarding (1) an agreement to extend the substantial completion deadline; (2) whether Meritage,\nthrough its oral agreement to extend the deadline and its continued work with SP Terrace after\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

SP Terrace also argued that the liquidated damages provision of the contract, which\nlimited SP Terrace's recovery to retention of the earnest money deposit, was unenforceable penalty\nbecause it hypothetically would allow the forfeiture of the deposit due to any breach by Meritage,\nincluding a trivial one.\n\n *281 The trial court granted Meritage's motions. Shortly thereafter, Meritage moved for entry of\na final judgment, asking the trial court to award it $268,000 in damages, $71,170.50 in attorney's\nfees incurred in prosecuting its claims in the trial court proceedings, $40,000 in attorney's fees if\nSP Terrace appeals to an intermediate appellate court, and an additional $27,500 in attorney's fees\nif Meritage ultimately prevails after full briefing and oral argument to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\nSP Terrace moved the trial court to reconsider the summary judgment. SP Terrace attached\nexcerpts from the deposition of Michael Pizzitola, taken after the original submission of the\nsummary judgment motions, to further support its contentions. SP Terrace also attached the\naffidavit of its counsel of record opposing Meritage's requested amount of attorney's fees. The trial\ncourt's docket sheet includes the following entry for December 8, 2008: “D. (seller) Motion for\nleave of court to file additional evidence granted.” The trial court did not memorialize the docket\nentry in any order, even though SP Terrace submitted a proposed order and requested that the trial\ncourt sign it.

The court, even taking this evidence into the record,\ndenies Plaintiff's motion for new trial.” See Dolcefino, 126 S.W.3d at 134. We noted that the trial\njudge's statement on the record indicated that the judge had accepted the evidence as belatedly\noffered summary judgment evidence. See id.

It attached the docket sheet and a proposed order, but the trial court never\nentered the order.

SP Terrace agreed, but requested a six-month extension of the December 31\ndeadline. According to Todd and Smalley, Meritage's representatives agreed to extend the deadline\nand to sign a written agreement confirming that extension. Smalley mailed a written extension to\nMeritage before December 31, and although Meritage never returned a signed extension, it also\nnever objected.\n\nMeritage points to a January 20, 2006, letter from Smalley to Steve Harding as evidence that the\nparties did not agree to extend the deadline:\n\n            I had previously sent you an addendum to the Earnest Money Contract prior to\n            the end of the year extending the date of the contract to June 30, 2006. As of this\n            date, I have not received an executed addendum. I know there are still questions\n            to be answered, but we need some assurance that we can reach an agreement\n            and declare some sort of modified substantial completion.\n\nIt is thus undisputed that the parties never signed a written agreement to extend the deadline beyond\nDecember 31. In addition, SP Terrace viewed the extension of time to be a material alteration to\nthe contract, sufficient to excuse it from further performance, stating to the trial court:\n\n            Meritage agreed to extend the substantial completion date and/or caused a\n            default or delay in the substantial completion. Meritage then refused to perform\n            under the Contract by its February 3, 2006 letter. This evidence is sufficient to\n            show a prior or anticipatory breach by Meritage, which would excuse further\n            performance by SP Terrace.\n\nSP Terrace thus asserts that Meritage's breach of the alleged oral extension of the substantial\ncompletion deadline was sufficient to excuse any further performance by SP Terrace. The\nmodification here is a *284 material term—as such, it is unenforceable because it was never\nreduced to writing. See Walker, 107 S.W.3d at 670; King, 690 S.W.2d at 620. We hold that the trial\ncourt correctly granted summary judgment on SP Terrace's affirmative defense of modification.\n\n\nWaiver of the Substantial Completion Deadline\n [11] [12] SP Terrace next contends that a fact issue exists regarding Meritage's waiver of the\nDecember 31 deadline. A party establishes waiver by demonstrating (1) the express renunciation\nof a known right or (2) silence or inaction for so long as to show the intent to yield a known right.\nSee Motor Vehicle Bd. v.

In contrast, here, Todd and Smalley aver that\nMeritage continued to participate in meetings with SP Terrace representatives and work with SP\nTerrace on further changes to the development even after the December 31 deadline, indicating\nthat it continued to insist on performance after breach of the agreement. In his affidavit, Tyler Todd\nstates that SP Terrace “continued to work with [Meritage] under the Contract and to accommodate\nchanges requested by [Meritage] throughout December 2005, January 2006, and into February\n2006.” Kelly Smalley states that a Meritage representative participated in a meeting to discuss the\nproposed subdivision changes on January 10, 2006, after the deadline.

The trial court rejected this claim, and SP Terrace appeals. Meritage responds that SP\nTerrace's counterclaim is not one for affirmative relief, but in any event, SP Terrace's recovery is\nlimited to the earnest money contract.\n\n\nA. Claim for Affirmative Relief\n [22] [23] Meritage argues that SP Terrace's asserted contractual defense to the refund of\nMeritage's earnest money deposit is not an affirmative claim for relief. To qualify as a claim for\naffirmative relief, the defendant must allege a cause of action independent of the plaintiff's claim,\non which the defendant can recover benefits, compensation, or relief, even though the plaintiff\nmay abandon or fail to establish its claim. See Gen. Land Office v. OXY USA, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1492533\"><a href=\"/opinion/1492533/general-land-office-of-the-state-of-tex-v-oxy-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 570 (Tex.1990). If the defendant only resists the plaintiff's right to recover, then it does not\nstate a claim for affirmative relief. See id.\n\nIn its “Second Amended Answer and First Amended Counterclaim,” SP Terrace stated that\nMeritage's “actions, promises and representations” constituted a prior breach of the contract by\nMeritage, which excused SP Terrace from further performance and entitled SP Terrace to retain the\nearnest money deposit and recover actual damages, including lost profits, of at least $1,400,000.\n\n [24] Meritage argues that because SP Terrace always possessed the earnest money deposit, and\nif SP Terrace prevailed or Meritage abandoned its claim, SP Terrace would simply retain the\nearnest money. Therefore, SP Terrace's counterclaim, which asks the trial court to determine\nthat SP Terrace is entitled to the earnest money, is essentially a claim for declaratory relief.\nWe disagree. SP Terrace asked the trial court to determine it has a right to the earnest money\ndeposit, but it also seeks actual damages beyond the earnest money deposit. See Howell v.

Earnest Money as Liquidated Damages\n [25] SP Terrace asked the trial court to set aside the earnest money liquidated damages provision\nfor a breach by Meritage, contending that it penalizes Meritage because it requires Meritage to\nforfeit its earnest money no matter how trivial its breach. SP Terrace requests this interpretation\nof the contract so that its damages claim against Meritage can exceed the earnest money deposit\nit kept after Meritage terminated the contract. The clause in question provides that, upon default\nby Meritage, SP Terrace, as its sole remedy, may terminate the contract and retain the earnest\nmoney deposit.\n\n [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] We enforce a liquidated damages clause if (1) the harm caused\nby the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) the amount of liquidated damages\nis a reasonable forecast of just compensation.

See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. For example, in Phillips, the\nTexas Supreme Court observed that “to show that a liquidated damages provision is unreasonable\nbecause the actual damages incurred were much less than the amount contracted for, a defendant\nmay be required to prove what the actual damages were.” Id.\n\n [31] SP Terrace adduced no evidence in the trial court that Meritage's forfeit of its earnest money\noperated as a penalty because Meritage's breach was a trivial one. Its aim was just the opposite—\nit was to prove that Meritage's breach caused damages far higher than the earnest money amount,\nalthough it offered no proof of that theory either. We decline to remove a limitation of remedy\nprovision absent any evidence that the liquidated amount in the contract is unreasonably high or\nlow in light of the alleged breach.

We further hold that SP Terrace's counterclaim states a claim for\naffirmative relief, but that SP Terrace fails to prove on this record that the earnest money provision\nof the contract is unenforceable as a matter of law. We therefore reverse and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings. 3\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The contract provides in section 16(k) that the substantial completion deadline “would be extended” if Meritage caused the delay\n       of the deadline. Meritage argued in the trial court that SP Terrace's reference to section 16(k) in an amended pleading filed after its\n       motion for partial summary judgment was filed came too late to support its contractual defenses. We disagree, in so much as SP\n       Terrace expressly argued in its summary judgment response that “by words, actions and inaction, Meritage caused the default and/\n       or delay in the substantial completion.”\n2      Other jurisdictions that have addressed this issue have held similarly, and refused to strike the liquidated damages provision on the\n       ground that it is an unenforceable penalty.

C. Stewart and wife, leased to respondent, James Marvin\nBasey, three store buildings on South Congress Avenue in the city of Austin. The lease stated that\nit was for a term of five years, beginning on January 1, 1949, and ending at midnight on December\n31, 1954. The dates cover a period of six years, but for the purposes of this opinion it is immaterial\nwhether the term was five years or six years. The lease provided for a monthly rental of $325.00,\npayable each month in advance. Respondent went into possession under the lease and paid the\nmonthly rentals through November, 1949, during which month he vacated the buildings. On the\nfollowing December 5th the keys were returned to petitioners upon their request, since which time\nthey have executed leases to other tenants. The provision of the contract which we are called upon\nto construe reads as follows: ‘The failure to pay any monthly installment of rental when such\ninstallment is due shall terminate this lease at the option of Lessors. The failure of Lessee to make\nsaid payment or payments or the breach of this contract otherwise by him shall render him liable\nto Lessors, as agreed liquidated damages, the sum of One Hundred Fifty (150) Dollars per month\nfor each and every month of the unexpired term of this lease which shall become due and payable\nwhen the option to terminate this lease is exercised or at the time of the breach of this contract\notherwise by Lessee if any, and the payment thereof be secured by lien on the property of Lessee\nin said Store Buildings at said time.’\n\nAnother provision of the contract is: ‘That the violation of any term of this lease by either party\nhereto shall terminate the same at the option of the other.’\n\nIt will be observed that liability for the payment of $150.00 *669 per month as liquidated damages\nis not limited to the breach of any one particular covenant of the contract. The covenant to pay the\nrent when due is but one of the covenants the breach of which would give rise to a claim by the\nlessors for $150.00 per month for each and every month of the unexpired term of the lease.\n [1] Volumes have been written on the question of when a stipulated damage provision of a\ncontract should be enforced as liquidated damages and when enforcement **486 should be denied\nbecause it is a penalty provision. One line of cases, of which Eakin v. Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">777</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, is typical, states that the intention of the parties governs and another line states that their\nintention is immaterial, but when the results are examined there appears but little disparity between\nthem. All agree that to be enforceable as liquidated damages the damages must be uncertain and\nthe stipulation must be reasonable. There is a statement in the opinion in Eakin v. Scott, supra,\nwhich, standing alone, would lead to the conclusion that the damages in that case were certain\nin amount. But when the entire opinion is read, it becomes obvious that the damages were very\nuncertain in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was executed; and that is the true\ntest of uncertainty. The true theory is well expressed in Williston on Contracts, Revised Edition,\nSec. 779, p. 2192, in this language: ‘But as has been seen, the chief, almost the only, means of\ndetermining whether the parties in good faith endeavored to assess the damages is afforded by\nthe amount of damages stipulated for, and the nature of the breach upon which the stipulation\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This is but saying in other words that the reasonableness or\nunreasonableness of the stipulation is decisive.’\n\n [2] The cases which hold that the intention of the parties controls impute to the parties an intention\nto provide for a penalty when it would be unreasonable and unjust to do otherwise, even though\ntheir language clearly expresses the contrary intention. They indulge in a presumption in order to\narrive at the justice of the case. The cases which disregard the intention of the parties treat the\nquestion as one of the legality of the stipulation. The reasoning in Langever v. R. G. Smith & Co.,\nTex.Com.App., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179, is typical of that employed in cases which announce that the\nintention of the parties controls. The statement in the opinion that ‘the real intention of the parties\nwhen ascertained will control’ is followed by the statement that such intention ‘is not necessarily\nascretained by the words *670 employed’. Regardless of which line of cases is followed, the\ncourts will not be bound by the language of the parties.\n\n [3] The right of competent parties to make their own bargains is not unlimited. The universal rule\nfor measuring damages for the breach of a contract is just compensation for the loss or damage\nactually sustained. By the operation of that rule a party generally should be awarded neither less\nnor more than his actual damages. A party has no right to have a court enforce a stipulation which\nviolates the principle underlying that rule. In those cases in which courts enforce stipulations of\nthe parties as a measure of damages for the breach of covenants, the principle of just compensation\nis not abandoned and another principle substituted therefor. What courts really do in those cases\nis to permit the parties to estimate in advance the amount of damages, provided they adhere to\nthe principle of just compensation. Restatement of Contracts, Sec. 339, accurately expresses the\nrule as follows:\n‘(1) An agreement, made in advance of breach fixing the damages therefor, is not enforceable as\na contract and does not affect the damages recoverable for the breach, unless\n\n‘(a) the amount so fixed is a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm that is caused\nby the breach, and\n\n‘(b) the harm that is caused by the breach is one that is incapable or very difficult of accurate\nestimation.’\n\n\n\nThis comment on subsection (1) follows: ‘b. Contracts are frequently made in which performance\nof very different degrees of importance and value are promised and one large sum of money\nis made payable as damages for any breach whatever. Since such a contract promises the same\nreparation for the breach of a trivial or comparatively unimportant stipulation as for the breach of\nthe most important one or of the whole contract, it is obvious that the parties have not adhered to\nthe rule of just compensation. In this matter neither the intention of the parties nor their expression\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It provides that for the failure of lessee to\npay any installment of rent when due or for his breach of any other obligation of the contract, the\nlessors could, at their option, terminate the lease. Should they elect to terminate it, the lessee would\nbe obligated to pay them at that time a sum of money arrived at by multiplying $150.00 by the\nnumber of months of the unexpired term of the lease. Should they not elect to terminate the lease\nthey could, nevertheless, demand that amount in a lump sum on the date of the breach. The lease\ncontains several covenants other than the covenant to pay rent when due. One is a covenant of\nindemnity in this language: ‘Lessee further covenants and agrees to keep Lessors free and harmless\nfrom any and every claim, demand, or cause of action arising in or on the leased premises during\nthe term of this lease.’\n\n\nAnother is a covenant that lessee will prudently use the premises and avoid injuries thereto, except\nusual wear and tear, and another that lessee will ‘make such repairs as are not caused by Lessors\nor their agents and the usual depletion of said property.’\n\nIt is not necessary for us to decide whether petitioners would have been entitled to liquidated\ndamages had the lease contract contained no covenant except the covenant to pay rent, and we\ntherefore pass that question by without discussion. It is clear that petitioners should not be awarded\na large sum for liquidated damages for the breach of the other covenants just mentioned. Take,\nfor instance, the covenant for indemnity. Whatever amount respondent might have been called\nupon to pay petitioners as an indemnity would have been a *672 definite amount measured by\nthe liability theretofore adjudged against petitioners. An obligation to pay an indemnity is nothing\nmore than an obligation to pay a sum of money theretofore ascertained, and a provision that failure\nto pay a definite sum of money upon default of performance of a covenant in a contract entitles the\nobligee to recover liquidated damages in excess of the interest rate will not be enforced.

See\nTex. Ins.Code Ann. arts. 5.06–1, –3 (West 1981). State Farm moved for summary judgment, and\nTaylor moved for partial summary judgment. The district court granted State Farm's motion, and\ndismissed Taylor's case. We affirm the summary judgment in favor of State Farm.\n\n\n\n                                                BACKGROUND\n\nTaylor purchased multi-peril insurance for her business from State Farm in 1993. At that\ntime, multi-peril insurance policies were promulgated by the Texas Department of Insurance\n(“TDI”). Within that policy, State Farm offered limited non-owned auto liability insurance. Taylor\npurchased hired auto liability insurance as an endorsement to her multi-peril policy. In 1996, TDI\nallowed State Farm to write its own multi-peril policy subject to TDI's approval. At that time, State\nFarm issued hired and non-owned auto liability insurance as an endorsement to Taylor's multi-\nperil policy. None of the hired and non-owned auto liability coverage State Farm issued included\nPIP or UM/UIM coverage. Taylor contends that State Farm was required to issue PIP and UM/\nUIM coverage by the Texas Insurance Code. State Farm rejoins that TDI has the authority to\nregulate certain auto insurance by other provisions of the insurance code when TDI determines\nthat it is appropriate. State Farm further asserts that TDI has chosen to regulate hired and non-\nowned auto coverage under the multi-peril subchapter of the insurance code rather than the auto\nliability subchapter, and therefore, PIP and UM/UIM coverages are not mandatory with regard\nto the hired and non-owned auto liability insurance that forms a limited part of the multi-peril\ninsurance Taylor purchased for her business.\n\n\n\n                                         STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n [1] [2] Because the propriety of a summary judgment is a question of law, we review the\ntrial court's decision de novo. *668 Natividad v.

When the\ndistrict court granted State Farm's motion for summary judgment, it did not specify the grounds\nupon which it relied. Thus on appeal, Taylor argues that the district court erred in granting the\nsummary judgment by questioning every possible ground advanced. 1 Taylor asks: (1) Did she\nhave standing to seek declaratory relief?; (2) Did she have to exhaust administrative remedies\nbefore bringing suit?; (3) Is “hired and non-owned auto liability coverage” under this policy\nproperly classified as “automobile liability coverage” subject to mandatory PIP and UM/UIM\ncoverage?; (4) If “hired and non-owned auto liability coverage” is “automobile liability coverage,”\nmay TDI cancel or lessen coverage (PIP and UM/UIM) mandated by the legislature?; and (5) If\nTDI does have the authority to cancel or lessen mandated coverages, has it exercised any authority\nto do so?\n\n\nDoes the court have subject matter jurisdiction?\nBy Taylor's first issue she asks whether she has standing to bring this suit. We understand Taylor's\nquestion really to be whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction contingent on the “ripeness”\nof her suit. It is fairly clear that Taylor has standing—she is the appropriate person to bring the\naction. We will therefore address Taylor's jurisdictional question as to the “ripeness” of her suit.\nWe hold that her suit is ripe for consideration.\n\n [3] Taylor sought a declaratory judgment in district court to determine whether State Farm\nhad violated the Texas Insurance Code by issuing hired and non-owned auto liability insurance\nwithout providing PIP or UM/UIM coverage. The purpose of a declaratory judgment is “to settle\nand to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal\nrelations; and it is to be liberally construed and administered.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code\nAnn. § 37.002(b) (West 1997). However, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (“UDJA”)\ndoes not confer jurisdiction on a trial court but rather makes declaratory judgment available as a\nremedy for a *669 cause of action already within the court's jurisdiction.

However, the\nfact situation must manifest the “ ‘ripening seeds of a controversy’ ... even though the differences\nbetween the parties as to their legal rights have not reached the state of an actual controversy.”\nAinsworth, 271 S.W.2d at 761, cited in Moore, 985 S.W.2d at 154. In other words, there must\neither be a pending cause of action between the parties or such a clear indication of the extent of\nthe parties' differences that a court may presume one is imminent.\n\n [5] In the present case, although Taylor has not filed a claim against State Farm on the hired and\nnon-owned auto liability coverage in her multi-peril policy, she asserts that State Farm has already\nviolated articles 5.06–1 and 5.06–3 of the insurance code by issuing automobile insurance without\nincluding PIP and UM/UIM coverage. See Tex. Ins.Code Ann. arts. 5.06–1, –3. The language of\nboth articles suggests that if Taylor's understanding of the insurance code is accurate (that hired and\nnon-owned auto liability coverage must be issued with PIP and UM/UIM coverage), State Farm\nhas indeed already violated the statute and has thereby infringed Taylor's legal rights. Whether\nState Farm was required to issue hired and non-owned automobile insurance with PIP and UM/\nUIM coverage is a question of law that may be appropriately decided by Taylor's invocation of\nthe UDJA. As such, Taylor's controversy is ripe for adjudication, and the court has subject matter\njurisdiction to hear her case.\n\n\nDid Taylor have to exhaust administrative remedies?\n [6] [7] In her second issue, Taylor asks whether she was required to exhaust any administrative\nremedies before bringing her suit in district court. Requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies\nis a well-established doctrine, but it has numerous exceptions. Taylor did not file a formal\ncomplaint with TDI. However, when pure questions of law are involved, the doctrine of exhaustion\nof administrative remedies does not apply. See Grounds v. Tolar Indep. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2458256\"><a href=\"/opinion/2458256/grounds-v-tolar-independent-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 892 (Tex.1986). In this case, the facts are undisputed and the question before the trial court\nis a pure question of law—whether hired and non-owned auto liability insurance must be issued\nwith PIP and UM/UIM coverage under the Texas Insurance Code. Concluding that Taylor did not\nneed to exhaust her administrative remedies prior to raising this issue of law before the trial court,\nwe agree that this could not form the basis for summary judgment.\n\n\nDid TDI have authority?\n [8] In her third and fourth issues, Taylor asks whether hired and non-owned auto liability\ninsurance is properly classified as “auto liability insurance” as contemplated by article 5,\nsubchapter A of the insurance code, and, if so, whether PIP and UM/UIM coverage must be issued\n *670 with hired and non-owned auto liability coverage.

If such a *671 situation\n            shall be found to exist, the Board shall make an order declaring which of said\n            rating laws shall be applicable....\n\nId. at art. 5.02.\n\nTaking the provisions together and noting their relative placements within the subchapter dealing\nwith automobile insurance, it is clear that article 5.02 grants TDI the discretion to except some\nkinds of auto insurance from subchapter A's mandatory PIP and UM/UIM coverage.\n\nState Farm urges the Court to accept the Sidelnik decision as controlling the case before us. Sidelnik\nv. American States Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1716423\"><a href=\"/opinion/1716423/sidelnik-v-american-states-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App.-Austin 1996, writ denied). In Sidelnik,\nan umbrella insurance policy was at issue. Any auto coverage encompassed within that umbrella\npolicy was excess to the primary insurance coverage the insured had to obtain before being issued\nthe umbrella policy. Id. The facts at hand do not exactly fit the Sidelnik scenario. Although it is\ntrue, as a practical matter, that in most cases hired and non-owned auto coverage operates much\nlike an excess policy—excess to the primary coverage owned by the user—there are situations in\nwhich the hired and non-owned auto policy could be the only, and thus primary, coverage. For\nthat reason, Sidelnik does not control the question presented regarding this multi-peril policy.\n\nNevertheless, TDI has unambiguous authority under article 5.02 to exclude some auto insurance\nfrom the requirements of subchapter A when in its judgment it is a type of insurance “more\nproperly regulated under the terms or provisions of other insurance rating laws.” Tex. Ins.Code\nAnn. art. 5.02. As discussed above, Taylor's hired and non-owned auto liability coverage was\nissued as an endorsement—a small part of her multi-peril business policy. Neither endorsement\nwas rated based on the risk characteristics of the car or driver. And in fact, Taylor only paid $3.07\nper $100 in anticipated annual rental expenses per year for her hired auto liability endorsement\nand approximately $4.00 a year for her non-owned auto liability endorsement. We reject Taylor's\nreading of articles 5.06–1 and 5.06–3 and overrule issues three and four.\n\n\nDid TDI exercise its authority?\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We conclude that TDI has exercised its authority to do so.\n\nTaylor argues that in the event TDI wanted to except hired and non-owned auto liability from\nsubchapter A, it had to do so by an order that specifically invoked its authority to do so under\narticle 5.02. We disagree. In 1992, TDI ordered that garage insurance, “including all coverages\nand endorsements included in the Texas Garage Policy, except for those coverages specifically\nrated on the basis of risk characteristics of the automobile or person driving,” be regulated under\nthe multiperil subchapter of the insurance code. At that time, as well as today, hired auto liability\ninsurance was an endorsement under the Texas Garage Policy that was not specifically rated on the\nbasis of risk characteristics of the automobile or person driving. As for the limited non-owned auto\nliability insurance, it had been included within the Texas Business Owners Policy promulgated by\nTDI. The fact that TDI did not expressly state that it was using the discretion afforded it under\narticle 5.02 does *672 not render either order invalid. We overrule Taylor's fifth issue.\n\n\n\n                                                          CONCLUSION\n\nBecause the district court appropriately granted State Farm's summary judgment and properly\ndenied Taylor's partial summary judgment, we affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Grounds one and two would more properly be grounds for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction not summary judgment.

We affirm the trial court's judgment as it relates to TAB's\njury trial challenge and reverse its judgment as to TAB's open courts challenge.\n\nAn overview of the regulatory scheme enacted by the legislature and these agencies is essential to\nan understanding of this case. In 1967, the Texas Legislature enacted the Clean Air Act of Texas.\nClean Air Act of Texas, 60th Leg., R.S., ch. 727, 1967 Tex.Gen.Laws 1941. The Clean Air Act was\ndesigned to safeguard the state's air resources without compromising the economic development\nof the state. Id. at § 1. The Act created the Texas Air Control Board and granted it the authority\nto promulgate regulations to accomplish the Act's goals. Id. at § 4(A)(2)(a). In the event the Air\nControl Board determined that a violation of its regulations had occurred, it was authorized to\nenforce those regulations in district court. Upon a judicial determination that a violation of the\nAir Control Board's regulations had occurred, two cumulative remedies were available, injunctive\nrelief to prohibit further violations and assessment of a fine ranging from $50 to $1,000 for each\nday the violations persisted. Id. at § 12(B).\n\nIn 1969, the Texas Legislature enacted the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Solid Waste Disposal Act,\n61st Leg., R.S., ch. 405, 1969 Tex.Gen.Laws 1320. The express purpose for this legislation was\nto protect public health and welfare by regulating the “collection, handling, storage, and disposal\nof solid waste.” Id. at § 1. The Texas Water Quality Board was designated the primary agency to\neffectuate the Disposal Act's purpose. Id. at § 4(f). Like the Air Control Board, the Water Quality\nBoard was authorized to enforce its rules and regulations in state district court. The Solid Waste\nDisposal Act provided the same remedies as the Clean Air Act. See id. at § 8(c).\n\nIn the last of the relevant statutory enactments, in 1969, the Texas Legislature promulgated a\nrevised version of the Water Quality Act. Water Quality Act—Revision, 61st Leg., R.S., ch. 760,\n1969 Tex.Gen.Laws 2229. By that Act, the Water Quality Board was given the power to develop\na statewide water quality plan, to perform research and investigations, and to adopt rules and\nissue orders necessary to effectuate the Act's purposes. Id. at § 3.01–3.10. The Water Quality Act\nprovided the same remedies as the Solid Waste Management Act and the Clean Air Act. See id.\nat § 4.02.\n\nOriginally, neither the Water Quality Board nor the Air Control Board had the power to levy civil\npenalties directly in the event it determined that its regulations or orders had been violated. Instead,\neach board was required first to file suit against the violator in district court. Only the district court\nhad the power to assess civil penalties.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

That year the Air Control\nBoard and the Water Commission (formerly the Water Control Board) were granted the power\nto assess civil penalties directly of up to $10,000 per day per violation. 2 Both administrative\nbodies also retained the option to pursue civil penalties in district court. *443 TEX.HEALTH\n& SAFETY CODE §§ 361.224, 382.081; TEX.WATER CODE § 26.123. This was the regulatory\nscheme in effect when the district court rendered judgment in this case. 3\n\nAfter the Air Control Board or Water Commission assesses a penalty, the offender must either\ntimely pay the penalty or file suit in district court. However, a supersedeas bond or cash deposit\npaid into an escrow account, in the full amount of the penalty, is a prerequisite to judicial review.\nTEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 382.089(a), (b), 361.252(k), (l ); TEX.WATER CODE\n§ 26.136(j). A party who fails to make a cash deposit or file a bond forfeits all rights to judicial\nreview. TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 361.252(m), 382.089(c); TEX.WATER CODE §\n26.136(k).\n\nTAB alleges that it is a Texas not-for-profit corporation, that its members do business throughout\nTexas, and that it is authorized to represent its members on any matter that may have an impact\non their businesses.\n\nTAB filed this suit under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, TEX.CIV.PRAC. &\nREM.CODE §§ 37.001–37.011, alleging that some of its members had been subjected to civil\npenalties assessed by either the Air Control Board or the Water Commission. TAB further alleged\nthat all of its other members that operate their businesses pursuant to the pertinent provisions of\nthe Texas Clean Air Act, the Texas Water Code, or the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act or any\nrules or orders issued pursuant to those provisions were put at “substantial risk (if not certainty)”\nof being assessed civil penalties by the Air Control Board or the Water Commission. Thus this\nsuit does not challenge specific instances of the Air Control Board's or the Water Commission's\nexercise, or threatened exercise, of the civil penalty power. Instead, TAB's suit is a facial challenge\nto the constitutionality of this administrative enforcement scheme under the Texas Constitution.\n\nThe Defendants and Intervenors counterclaimed seeking a declaratory judgment that the statutes,\nrules, and regulations challenged by TAB do not, on their face, conflict with the open courts and\njury trial provisions of our constitution. The trial court granted the Defendants' and Intervenors'\nrequested declaratory judgment and denied TAB's request for a declaratory judgment. The court\nalso denied TAB's request for injunctive relief.\n\nTAB appealed directly to this court. See TEX.GOV'T CODE § 22.001(c); 4 TEX.R.APP.P. 140.\nIn this court, TAB has limited its challenges to claims of unconstitutional denial of a jury trial and\nviolation of our constitution's open courts provision.\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Standing\n\nBefore we reach the merits of this case, we first consider the matter of the trial court's jurisdiction,\nas well as our own; specifically we determine whether TAB has standing to challenge the statutes\nand regulations in question. Because TAB's standing to bring this action is not readily apparent,\nand because our jurisdiction as well as that of the trial court depends on this issue, we requested\nsupplemental briefing on standing at the oral argument of this case. In response, the parties insist\nthat any question of standing has been waived in the trial court and cannot be raised by the court\nfor the first time on appeal. We disagree.\n\n [1] Subject matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to decide a case. Standing\nis implicit in the concept of subject matter jurisdiction. The standing requirement stems from two\nlimitations on subject matter jurisdiction: the separation of powers doctrine and, in Texas, the open\ncourts provision. Subject matter jurisdiction *444 is never presumed and cannot be waived. 5\n\n [2] [3] One limit on courts' jurisdiction under both the state and federal constitutions is the\nseparation of powers doctrine.

To comport with Article III, a federal court may hear a case only when the litigant has\nbeen threatened with or has sustained an injury. Valley Forge Christian College, 454 U.S. at 471,\n102 S.Ct. at 758. Under the Texas Constitution, standing is implicit in the open courts provision,\nwhich contemplates access to the courts only for those litigants suffering an injury. Specifically,\nthe open courts provision provides:\n\n            All courts shall be open, and every person for an injury done him, in his lands,\n            goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law.\n\nTEX. CONST. art. I, § 13 (emphasis added). Because standing is a constitutional prerequisite to\nmaintaining a suit under both federal and Texas law, we look to the more extensive jurisprudential\nexperience of the federal courts on this subject for any guidance it may yield.\n\nUnder federal law, a lack of standing deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction because\nstanding is an element of such *445 jurisdiction.

Because we conclude that standing is a\ncomponent of subject matter jurisdiction, it cannot be waived and may be raised for the first time\non appeal. 8\n\n [8] If we were to conclude that standing is unreviewable on appeal at least three undesirable\nconsequences could result. First and foremost, appellate courts would be impotent to prevent lower\ncourts from exceeding their constitutional and statutory limits of authority. Second, appellate\ncourts could not arrest collusive suits. Third, by operation of the doctrines of res judicata and\ncollateral estoppel, judgments rendered in suits addressing only hypothetical injuries could bar\nrelitigation of issues by a litigant who eventually suffers an actual injury. We therefore hold that\nstanding, as a component of subject matter *446 jurisdiction, cannot be waived in this or any\nother case and may be raised for the first time on appeal by the parties or by the court.\n\nWe are aware that this holding conflicts with Texas Industrial Traffic League v.

MARY'S L.J. 865,\n870 (1990).\n\n [11] Here, however, we are not reviewing a trial court order of dismissal for want of jurisdiction,\nwe are considering standing for the first time on appeal. A review of only the pleadings to\ndetermine subject matter jurisdiction is sufficient in the trial court because a litigant has a right to\namend to attempt to cure pleading defects if jurisdictional facts are not alleged. See TEX.R.CIV.P.\n80. Failing that, the suit is dismissed. When an appellate court questions jurisdiction on appeal\nfor the first time, however, there is no opportunity to cure the defect. Therefore, when a Texas\nappellate court reviews the standing of a party sua sponte, it must construe the petition in favor of\nthe party, and if necessary, review the entire record to determine if any evidence supports standing.\n\n [12] TAB asserts standing on behalf of its members.

While we agree with the statement of the\ngeneral test for standing set out in Board of Water Engineers, we foresee difficulties in relying on\nit alone to determine the standing of an organization like TAB. For instance, when members of an\norganization have individual standing, but the organization was not established for the purpose of\nprotecting the particular interest at issue, it is not necessarily in the members' best interest to allow\nsuch a disinterested organization to sue on their behalf. Furthermore, an organization should not\nbe allowed to sue on behalf of its members when the claim asserted requires the participation of\nthe members individually rather than as an association, such as when the members seek to recover\nmoney damages and the amount of damages varies with each member.\n\n [13] The United States Supreme Court has articulated a standard for associational standing that\nlends itself to our use. We adopt that test today. In Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising\nCommission, the Court held that an association has standing to sue on behalf of its members when\n“(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks\nto protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the\nrelief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109703\"><a href=\"/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n343, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109703\"><a href=\"/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Reviewing the record in its entirety\nfor evidence supporting subject matter jurisdiction, and resolving any doubt in TAB's favor, we\nconclude that TAB has standing to pursue the relief it seeks in this case.\n\nThe first prong of the Hunt test requires that TAB's pleadings and the rest of the record demonstrate\nthat TAB's members have standing to sue in their own behalf. This requirement should not be\ninterpreted to impose unreasonable obstacles to associational representation. In this regard the\nUnited States Supreme Court stated that “the purpose of the first part of the Hunt test is simply to\nweed out plaintiffs who try to bring cases, which could not otherwise be brought, by manufacturing\nallegations of standing that lack any real foundation.” New York State Club Ass'n, 487 U.S. at 9,\n108 S.Ct. at 2232. We are satisfied that TAB has not manufactured this lawsuit. A comparison of\nthe association's membership roster with the list of businesses subjected to state penalties indicates\nindividual TAB members have been assessed administrative penalties pursuant to the challenged\nenactments. Additionally, TAB has alleged that other of its members remain at substantial risk of\npenalty. A substantial risk of injury is sufficient under Hunt. See e.g., Pennell v. City of San Jose,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112009\"><a href=\"/opinion/112009/pennell-v-san-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 n. 3, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112009\"><a href=\"/opinion/112009/pennell-v-san-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus TAB satisfies the first prong of the Hunt test.\n\nThe second prong of Hunt requires that TAB's pleadings and the rest of the record demonstrate\nthat the interests TAB seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose. TAB was\nchartered to “represent the interests of its members on issues which may impact upon its members'\nbusinesses.” Considering a very similar question in New York State Club Association, the United\nStates Supreme Court held that: “[T]he associational interests that the consortium seeks to protect\nare germane to its purpose: appellant's certificate of incorporation states that its purpose is ‘to\npromote the common business interests of its *448 [member clubs].’ ” 487 U.S. at 10 n. 4, 108\nS.Ct. at 2232, n. 4 (bracketed language in original). Likewise, the interests TAB desires to protect\nare germane to the organization's purpose, and thus the second prong is met.\n\nUnder the third and final prong of the Hunt test, TAB's pleadings and the record must demonstrate\nthat neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested require the participation of individual\nmembers in the lawsuit. The Supreme Court has interpreted this prong as follows:\n\n            [W]hether an association has standing to invoke the court's remedial powers on\n            behalf of its members depends in substantial measure on the nature of the relief\n            sought. If in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, injunction, or\n            some other form of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supposed that the\n            remedy, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those members of the association\n            actually injured.\n\nHunt, 432 U.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441 (quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at 515, 95 S.Ct. at 2213).\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Recognizing that the suit raised “a pure question of\nlaw,” and that “the individual circumstances” of any aggrieved member were not in issue, the Court\nheld that the UAW had standing to challenge the government's actions. Id. at 287–88, 290, 106\nS.Ct. at 2531–32, 2533; see also Pennell, 485 U.S. at 7 n. 3, 108 S.Ct. at 855 n. 3 (facial challenge\nto rent ordinance does not require participation of individual landlords). Here, TAB seeks only\nprospective relief, raises only issues of law, and need not prove the individual circumstances of\nits members to obtain that relief, thus meeting the third prong of Hunt.\n\nHaving found that TAB meets all three prongs of the Hunt test, we conclude that TAB has standing\nto pursue the relief it seeks in this case.\n\n\n\n                                                II. Open Courts\n\nTAB contends that the forfeiture provisions of the statutes and regulations in question violate the\nopen courts provision of the Texas Constitution by unreasonably restricting access to the courts.\nAfter the agency has found a party to be in violation of any of these statutes and regulations, the\noffender must either tender a cash deposit or post a supersedeas bond in the full amount of the\npenalties assessed, or forfeit the right to judicial review. 11\n\nHistorically, we have recognized at least three separate constitutional guarantees emanating\nfrom our open courts provision. First, courts must actually be open and operating, so that, for\nexample, the legislature must place every county within a judicial district. Runge & Co. v.\nWyatt, 25 Tex.Supp. 294 (1860). Second, citizens must have access to those courts unimpeded by\nunreasonable financial barriers, so that the legislature cannot impose a litigation tax in the form\nof increased filing fees to enhance the state's general revenue, LeCroy v. Hanlon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432899\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432899/lecroy-v-hanlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 342 (Tex.1986). Finally, meaningful legal remedies must be afforded to our citizens, so\nthat the legislature may not abrogate the right to assert a well-established common law cause of\naction unless the reason for its action outweighs the litigants' constitutional right of redress. Sax\nv. Votteler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2407818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2407818/sax-v-votteler/\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 665–66 (Tex.1983).\n\n[15] Here the second guarantee is applicable.

In\nLeCroy, for example, the court did not permit increased filing fees for statutory causes of action\nwhile denying them for common law claims. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432899\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432899/lecroy-v-hanlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Likewise in Dillingham v. Putnam,\nwhen the court struck down a statute requiring a supersedeas bond as a condition of appeal, the\ncourt did not concern itself with whether the particular appeal being restricted involved a common\nlaw or statutory claim. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3954211\"><a href=\"/opinion/4185149/dillingham-receiver-v-putnam/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3954211\"><a href=\"/opinion/4185149/dillingham-receiver-v-putnam/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1890). Similarly, in the present case, the issue is\nsimply whether the prepayment requirement is an unreasonable financial barrier to access to the\ncourts in light of the state interest involved.\n\nThe stated purpose of the regulatory statutes at issue here is to protect our state's natural\nresources. 13 There is no question that this is an important state interest. 14 The state argues that\nthe prepayment provisions further this interest by increasing the deterrent effect of the penalties\nand by aiding in their collection. The state maintains that a violator will be less deterred by an\nadministrative penalty if it can delay payment without bond while appealing the case in the courts.\nThe state also argues that delay may render the penalty uncollectible, as the violator may become\ninsolvent.\n\nIn considering these rationales, we note that the prepayment provisions actually consist of two\nelements. First, the assessed penalty must be paid, or financial security provided, within thirty\ndays; enforcement is not stayed pending any period of judicial review. 15 Second, if payment is\nnot made or financial security provided within the thirty-day period, the right to judicial review\nis forfeited. We agree that the rationales advanced by the state justify the first of these elements.\nRequiring expeditious payment of the administrative penalties increases their effectiveness. The\nlegislature, however, could have imposed the first element without the second. It could have\nprovided the agency with the right to collection of assessed penalties unless a supersedeas bond\nis posted, yet provided for judicial review. The requirement of immediate payment, without the\ncorresponding forfeiture provision, would not have implicated the open courts provision, as the\ncharged party could have obtained judicial review regardless of payment. This approach would\nhave been in accordance with the usual procedure governing appeals of trial court judgments.\nSee TEX.R.APP.P. 40. Any litigant may appeal without superseding the trial court's judgment,\nbut the mere pendency of an appeal does not stay enforcement of the judgment. 16 *450 Our\nspecific focus for purposes of our open courts analysis, therefore, is not whether the requirement\nof immediate payment is reasonable, but whether the forfeiture of the right of judicial review, if\nthe penalties are not superseded, is reasonable.\n\nWe conclude that the forfeiture provision is an unreasonable restriction on access to the courts.\nWhile the requirement of prepayment or the posting of a bond to stay enforcement furthers the\nstate's important environmental interests by creating a strong incentive for timely payment of\nthe assessed penalties, the forfeiture provision serves no additional interest. 17 The state may\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Consistent with this noted exception in Credit Bureau, we conclude that these\nagencies' assessments of environmental penalties are not actions, or analogous actions, to those\ntried to a jury at the time the constitution of 1876 was adopted. To hold that these environmental\nstatutes and regulations promulgated in the late 1960s merely parrot common law and statutory\nrights triable to a jury in 1876 would turn a blind eye to the emergence of the modern administrative\nstate and its profound impact on our legal and social order. In the late 19th century, ours was\nprimarily a sparsely-populated agrarian society. See generally, T.R. Fehrenbach, Lone Star: A\nHistory of Texas and the Texans, 279–324 (1983). By contrast, concentrated industrial activity and\nits by-products, including the wide-spread emission of pollutants, with their resulting potential for\nsignificant damage to our natural resources are phenomena of relatively recent origin. In response\nto such phenomena, regulatory schemes, such as those challenged here, were designed to balance\nmounting environmental concerns with our state's economic vitality.

In Corzelius, we concluded that certain judicial functions, including fact finding,\nmay be delegated constitutionally by the legislature to administrative agencies in furtherance of\nthe preservation and conservation of the state's natural resources. The decision in Corzelius was\nbased on article XVI, section 59(a) of our constitution, which provides in relevant part: “The\nconservation and development of all the natural resources of this State ... and the preservation and\nconservation of all such natural resources ... are each and all ... public rights and duties; and the\nLegislature shall pass all such laws as may be appropriate thereto.” TEX. CONST. art. XVI, §\n59(a). “By the use of the broad language used in Article XVI, Section 59(a),” the court stated, “the\nLegislature is authorized to enact such laws as are necessary to carry out the purposes for which\nsuch constitutional amendment was adopted.” Corzelius, 186 S.W.2d at 964. 24\n\n [17] There is no doubt that the legislature delegated the power to assess these civil penalties\nto the Air Control Board and the Water Commission as a manifestation of the public's interest\nin preserving and conserving the state's air and water resources. That intent is apparent from the\npolicy statements of the relevant statutes. 25 *452 We conclude, therefore, that the delegation of\nthe fact-finding function by the legislature to the Air Control Board and the Water Commission\nunder this statutory scheme was within the legislature's constitutional authority.\n\nOf course, the fact that no jury trial is provided by the legislature to an alleged violator of these\nenvironmental protection laws does not mean that the agencies' power to assess penalties is\nunbridled. 26 The Air Control Board and the Water Commission may act only within constitutional\nand statutory parameters.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, we reverse that portion of the trial court's judgment declaring that\nsection 4.041 of the Texas Clean Air Act, sections 26.136 and 27.1015 of the Texas Water Code,\nand section 8b of the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act and the rules and regulations promulgated\nunder those statutes comport with the open courts provision of our constitution, article I, section 13.\nWe declare that the requirement of a supersedeas bond or cash deposit paid into an escrow account\nas a prerequisite to judicial review under TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 361.252(m)\n(first clause), 382.089(c) (first sentence), and TEX.WATER CODE § 26.136(k) (first sentence)\nis unconstitutional.

Hidden within its lengthy legal mumbo-jumbo\nis an unprecedented blow to our jury system. The constitutional right of trial by jury, already\nsuffering at the hands of this majority, is no longer inviolate; it may be abrogated at any time.\nInstead of walking into a courthouse, where a jury is guaranteed, citizens may be detoured to\nan administrative agency, to explain their problems to bureaucrats not directly answerable to the\ncommunity.\n\nToday precedent and tradition have been trampled as the majority's long-standing fear of ordinary\npeople in our legal system has taken firm hold. The drafters of our Texas Constitution realized\nsomething that the majority has long ceased to appreciate—ordinary Texans can make an\nextraordinary contribution to our system of justice. The more their collective voice expressed in\na jury verdict is disregarded, the more new barriers are contrived to shut them out of our system\nof justice, the less justice that system will offer.\n\n\n\n                                                I.

While concluding that TAB certainly has a right to judicial review on\nbehalf of its members, I disagree that the statutory restrictions it challenges unreasonably restrict\naccess to the courts.\n\nAccess to the courts is unquestionably a fundamental constitutional and common law right. Article\nI, section 13 of the Texas Constitution forms the nucleus of this protection:\n\n             *454 The open courts provision specifically guarantees all litigants the right to\n            redress their grievances—to use a popular and correct phrase, the right to their\n            day in court.

The majority today appropriately eliminates the first showing in certain\ncases. In some circumstances the distinction between common law and statutory causes of action\nclearly does not affect whether access to the courts has been denied.\n\nThe second part of the Sax test, however, continues to be applied in all open courts cases. 4 Thus,\nin determining whether the open courts provision of the Texas Constitution is violated by the\nrequirement that administrative penalties be paid as a prerequisite to judicial review, we must\nbalance two competing interests: the right of TAB's members to access to the courts and the state's\nconcern with effective and timely enforcement of its laws protecting the environment. The majority\ntoday restates in rather vague terms this second prong: “whether the prepayment requirement is\nan unreasonable financial barrier to access to the courts in light of the state interest involved.” 852\nS.W.2d at 449. As we held in LeCroy:\n\n\n   Because a substantial right is involved, the legislature cannot arbitrarily or unreasonably\n   interfere with a litigant's right of access to the courts. Thus, the general open courts provision\n   test balances the legislature's actual purpose in enacting the law against that law's interference\n   with the individual's right of access to the courts. The government has the burden to show that\n   the legislative purpose outweighs the interference with the individual's right of access.\n   713 S.W.2d at 341 (citations omitted; emphasis supplied).\nApplying this test, we have permitted certain restrictions on access to the courts, while disallowing\nothers.

The\nmore significant the right the litigant asserts, the more onerous the government's burden becomes.\nTAB has asserted a right to judicial review of penalties imposed against its members. This interest\nis encompassed within the right of access to the courts, which we declared a “substantial state\nconstitutional right.” LeCroy, 713 S.W.2d at 341.\n\nThe State has met its burden by demonstrating a compelling interest in employing administrative\npenalties reflected in constitutionally-guaranteed protection of our state's natural resources.\nAlthough not critical in overcoming an open courts challenge, a constitutional predicate for the\nstate's interest is a highly persuasive factor in the balancing process. As declared in article XVI,\nsection 59(a) 5 :\n\n\n  [T]he preservation and conservation of all ... natural resources of the State are each and all\n  declared public rights and duties; and the Legislature shall pass all laws as may be appropriate\n  thereto.\n  This very mandate of the people, as well as protection of the public health and safety was\n   effectuated in the Clean Air Act, 6 the Texas Water Code, 7 and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 8\n   including the right to assess administrative penalties. Protection of Texas' air, water and land\n   is undeniably a compelling interest.\n *456 The form of these particular administrative penalties has certainly been fashioned to serve\nthis important state interest through the least restrictive means. Penalty usage is substantially\nlimited and can in no way be said to be arbitrarily imposed. All three statutes at issue require\nthat, once a violation is established, the agency assessing a penalty must consider such factors as\nthe seriousness of the violation, including but not limited to the nature, circumstance, extent, and\ngravity of the prohibited acts; the hazard or potential hazard created to the public health or safety\nof the public; the history of previous violation; the amount necessary to deter future violations; and\nefforts to correct the violation. 9 There is thus statutory assurance that the amount of any resulting\npenalties will be directly related to the conduct.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Unlike the\nfiling fee held violative of the open courts provision in LeCroy, the legislative purpose is not to\nraise money by making it more expensive for citizens to enforce their legal rights. Instead, the\nlegislative objective is to deter and punish violations of the law that pose an environmental threat.\n\nThe wheels of justice grind slowly, with final resolution often years in reaching. Indeed, in\nthis court they sometimes hardly grind at all. Clearly those willing to profit from polluting our\nnatural resources will not hesitate to employ the delays in the judicial system to their advantage.\nA declaration of bankruptcy by a perhaps deliberately undercapitalized corporation during the\npendency of a suit is likely to relieve the polluter of any responsibility to remedy the damage it\nhas caused.\n\nShowing no awareness of the purpose of and need for administrative penalties, the majority finds\nthat “expeditious payment” is adequately guaranteed by the ability of the agency, through the\nattorney general, to initiate an enforcement action to collect the amount assessed. 852 S.W.2d at\n449 & n. 15. In other words, the purpose of immediate deterrence of violation of environmental\nlaws is ensured by the filing of a lawsuit that may take as many years to resolve as this case\nhas. These agencies charged with protecting our natural resources have long had the ability to\nbring an enforcement action in state court. See Tex.Water Code § 26.123; Tex.Health & Safety\nCode § 382.081; id. § 361.224. The effort of the Texas Legislature to improve the effectiveness\nof enforcement through the use of administrative penalties is today rendered a nullity.\n\nGiven the time and expense that must be devoted to pursuing an enforcement action in court, the\nState will have the capability to proceed against only the most egregious wrongs. The vast majority\nof administrative penalties to date have been relatively small, reflecting technical yet important\nstatutory violations. 10 In the absence of an administrative penalty power, most of these would\nhave gone unpunished, even though collectively the environmental impact of small violations\ncould be more profound than a major catastrophe. Relieving polluters from immediate sanctions\ndismantles the effectiveness of our laws protecting natural resources; no lesser means has been\nidentified that provides for prompt enforcement. I would hold that the state has demonstrated a\ncompelling interest in environmental protection that has been implemented by the least restrictive\nmeans, thus overriding any modest impediment that the prepayment of penalties may impose on\naccess to the courts.\n\n *457 Not even the slightest evidence has been provided to this court to suggest any actual\nrestrictive effect. No affidavit of any member of the Texas Association of Business appears in\nthe record stating that an inability to pay an administrative penalty has barred judicial review. As\nto most of the penalties assessed, $5,000 or less in amount, it is doubtful that such a contention\ncould be made. The majority necessarily concludes that imposing fines of $2,000 against Exxon\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Trial by Jury\n\nThe harm caused to our environment by today's writing is equalled only by the severe blow struck\nagainst our fundamental right of trial by jury. In holding that TAB and its members have no right to\na jury trial, the majority employs an analysis that has far-reaching ramifications. While I recognize\nthe need to accommodate the evolution of the administrative state, the history of this important\nguarantee mandates that only the narrowest of exceptions be permitted.\n\nThe ability of each individual to have a case heard by other members of the community is a vital\npart of our heritage and law. Long ago, Texans emphasized the paramount importance of this\nguarantee, stating in their grievances against the Mexican government:\n\n            It has failed and refused to secure, on a firm basis, the right of trial by jury,\n            that palladium of civil liberty, and only safe guarantee for the life, liberty, and\n            property of the citizen.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Texas (1836), reprinted in Tex.Const.app.\n519, 520 (Vernon 1955). A strong guarantee of this right had been unsuccessfully sought in an\n1833 draft constitution, 22 which was submitted to Mexico by Stephen F. Austin 23 and was later\nincorporated in the 1836 Texas Independence Constitution. 24\n\nThe central role of the jury as a democratic institution was firmly recognized, indeed celebrated,\nin our early jurisprudence by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas:\n\n            The institution of jury trial has, perhaps, seldom or never been fully appreciated.\n            It has been often eulogized in sounding *460 phrase, and often decried and\n            derided. An occasional corrupt, or biased, or silly verdict is not enough for\n            condemnation; and when it is said the institution interposes chances of justice\n            and checks against venality and oppression, the measure of just praise is not\n            filled. Its immeasurable benefits, like the perennial springs of the earth, flow\n            from the fact that considerable portions of the communities at stated periods are\n            called into the courts to sit as judges of contested facts, and under the ministry\n            of the courts to apply the laws.... Let us then preserve and transmit this mode of\n            trial not only inviolate, but if possible purified and perfected.\n\nBailey v.

In addition to the previous guarantee, which was carried\nforward in a new Bill of Rights, 26 further protection was included in the Judiciary Article. Tex.\nConst. art. IV, § 16 (1845). While under our national Constitution and those of almost all of our\nsister states trial by jury is available only for those actions that could have been brought at common\nlaw, the Texas Constitution since 1845 has also preserved that right in cases that historically would\nhave been brought in equity. Thus, even when a private party seeks injunctive relief that will\ninure to the public's benefit, any derogation of the right to a jury nonetheless violates the Texas\nConstitution.\n\nUrging support of the additional Judiciary Article guarantee, Convention President Thomas Rusk\ndeclared:\n\n            It is a dangerous principle to trust too much power in the hands of one man.\n            Would it not be better to trust a power of this nature in the hands of twelve men,\n            than to confide it to the breast of one?\n\nWilliam F. Weeks, Debates of the Texas Convention 268 (1846). He was opposed by John\nHemphill, later the first Chief Justice of this court, who actually “preferred the civil law” system,\nid. at 271–73, and Jefferson County delegate James Armstrong, who insisted the new section would\n“operate very injuriously.” Id. at 270. He declared:\n\n            It would be better, in my opinion, to leave it to the legislature to apply these\n            things; it is enough for us to say in the constitution that the trial by jury shall be\n            preserved inviolate. If we intend the jury to determine every thing, it would be\n            better to dispense with the judge altogether, as a useless appendage of the court.\n\nId. Today it is this same fear of juries, fortunately rejected in 1845, that now unfortunately prevails.\n\nThe original language providing for trial by jury in the Judiciary Article of 1845 was retained\nin later constitutions, Tex. Const. art. IV, § 16 (1861), Tex. Const. art. IV, § 20 (1866), but was\nthereafter extended to “all cases of law or equity.” Tex. Const. art. V, § 16 (1869). It took its final\nform in our present Constitution of 1876, which continues to afford not one but two assurances\non this vital subject:\n\n            In the trial of all causes in the District Courts, the plaintiff or defendant shall,\n            upon application made in open court, have the right to trial by jury....\n\nTex.

This is consistent with the majority's increasing\ndisfavor of decisionmaking by ordinary citizens composed as a jury. 27 Today's opinion insists that\nour constitutional assurance of trial by jury does not offer protection against legislative delegation\nof factfinding to an administrative bureaucracy. In essence, the majority engages in a massive\nredistribution of power from the people to the bureaucratic arm of state government. This extreme\nposition is totally unjustified in view of the staunch legal and historical underpinnings of our\nconstitutional commitment to afford Texans a jury of their peers.\n\nToday's opinion accurately describes one element of the dual constitutional protection for this\nfundamental liberty:\n\n            Article I, section 15 of our constitution preserves a right to trial by jury for those\n            actions, or analogous actions, tried to a jury at the time the constitution of 1876\n            was adopted.\n\n852 S.W.2d at 450 (footnote omitted).

Yet the\nmajority ignores the fact that even the earliest of pollution statutes was designed to deter and punish\nthose who harm our environment. Our jury trial article is thus decreed as dependent on form, not\nsubstance; not analogy, but exactitude. Under the majority's analysis, Credit Bureau was wrongly\ndecided since a regulatory prohibition against deceptive non-disclosure or ambiguous language\nwith the capacity to deceive was beyond the “deceptive acts” of common law fraud or deceit as\nit existed in 1876.\n\nSeizing upon the rather obvious proposition that the administrative state had not yet been created\nin 1876, the majority concludes that there is no right to trial by jury in judicial review of an\nadministrative proceeding. But under article I it is the nature of the cause of action that controls,\nnot the procedures under which it is enforced. Each of the three statutes considered today defines\n“pollution” of air, water or land to incorporate early nuisance concepts. Tex.

Both the text of our Constitution and its historical backdrop demand\nthat the right to trial by jury remain “inviolate.” When, as here, however, changing circumstances\nrequire reexamination of the scope of this right in order to preserve the evolved workings of\ngovernment, we must ensure that any exception does not destroy the guarantee. 38 We should\ninstead follow the command of our Constitution in light of our contemporary situation, by limiting\nany exception in the most narrow way possible without completely undermining the administrative\nstate.\n\nI would accordingly clarify any existing exception for administrative proceedings to preserve\nthe right to trial by jury in all suits except those in which the state is enforcing a regulation\nor statute protecting the public. If construed too broadly, however, even this exception limited\nto “public rights” could destroy our traditional reliance on the jury system. 39 Indeed, despite\nthe writing in Atlas Roofing, such erosion has already begun at the federal level. 40 Properly\nlimited, however, a “public rights” administrative exception to the right to trial by jury is both\nconstitutionally sound and easy to apply. While perhaps far-reaching in other contexts, “public\nrights” that conflict with the right of each member of the public to have factual disputes resolved\nby a public jury must be narrowly construed. I would not permit the concept of “public rights”\nto be perverted to deny such a fundamental right. In this limited circumstance, I would define\nproceedings involving “public rights” as those in which the government, as a real party in interest,\nenforces a regulatory or statutory scheme. Contrary to the majority, I do not suggest that we follow\nits standard preference for copying a “federal test,” 852 S.W.2d at 451 n. 24. Rather, I recommend\na narrow and clear Texas standard that looks to Texas law predating Atlas Roofing, and which\nlearns from the misapplication of this doctrine in the federal courts.\n\nHere TAB's members are not entitled to a jury trial because the state is enforcing public regulations\nby imposing administrative penalties. Although this action is analogous to a common law nuisance\nclaim, here the state is protecting the public's right to a clean environment rather than an *467\nindividual's use and enjoyment of private property.\n\nThe right to trial by jury is a critical state constitutional guarantee.

The trumpet call has sounded from the very earliest days of our Republic, heralding our right\nto trial by jury, a clarion to our citizens to shout out to preserve their heritage against attack. It\ndemands that any intrusion on this right be narrow in scope, clearly-announced and thoughtfully\nconsidered. The majority's refusal to define with certainty its erosion of the right to trial by jury\nsounds a weak and shaky chord, reflecting a lack of commitment to this fundamental guarantee.\nAttempting to let the strong note drown the weak, the majority seeks to hide its equivocation by\nreference to my conclusion that a jury trial is not required under these anti-pollution statutes, id.,\nand by criticizing the narrow, clear and thoughtful exception I have drawn today. Id.\n\nThe inviolate nature of the right to trial by jury demands that this vital guarantee be circumscribed\nin only the most extraordinary circumstances and that any exception to it be clearly and narrowly\nconstrued. Although I do not disagree with the result announced by the majority, the analysis\nemployed is designed to destroy one of our most precious freedoms as Texans. The alternative\nI offer would permit our administrative bodies to implement efficiently their regulations, while\nensuring that efficiency concerns do not envelop a fundamental civil liberty. 41\n\n\n\n                                                 III. Standing\n\nThe issue of standing is a stranger to this litigation. No party before this court has ever asserted that\nthe Texas Association of Business lacked capacity to challenge the actions of state government.\nHow rare the occasion when all litigants agree on the proper resolution of an issue, but how truly\nextraordinary is such unanimity when the parties are two state regulatory agencies, the Texas\nAssociation of Business, the Sierra Club and the League of Women Voters. This, nonetheless,\nis the exceptional circumstance in which we find ourselves today as all of these diverse parties\nhave urged the court not to decide this matter in the manner adopted. Addressing the question\nof standing solely at the belated insistence of the majority, all parties asserted that this issue was\nnot in dispute; that, under recent precedent, standing had been waived; 42 and, alternatively, that\nthe record adequately demonstrated the right of the Texas Association of Business under Texas\nlaw to initiate this litigation. Why then does the majority insist on writing? Because it dare not\npass up the opportunity to close access to our courts to those citizens who choose to challenge\nenvironmental degradation, neighborhood destruction and consumer abuse. Through a narrowly\ncrafted test, the majority extends an invitation to TAB to come into the courts while telling other\npublic interest groups to stay out.\n\nWhile devoting over half of today's opinion to a nonissue in this litigation, the majority oddly\nlimits its inquiry to only one of the three organizations asserting standing here. Nothing is said as\nto the League of Women Voters and the Sierra Club, both of which intervened in the trial court\nand were aligned as defendants with the State. Asserting the interests of its members in water and\nair quality, as well as its involvement in protecting the state's natural resources, the League of\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

By completely ignoring whether these groups were proper parties and by embracing a\nfederal standing test hostile to their participation, the majority erects new barriers to deny Texans\naccess to Texas courts.\n\nTo achieve this result, the majority must overcome what, until recently, was viewed as a\nconsiderable obstacle—Texas law.

And what unusual constitutional pillars each of these new finds represents. First, the\nproscription of the separation of powers doctrine against issuance of advisory judicial opinions\nallegedly requires rigorous enforcement of standing even when no party debates its existence. This\nlink between standing and separation of powers is not predicated on any directly relevant prior\ncourt decision, 47 but instead is entirely premised on an article openly antagonistic to standing\nfor environmental groups. 852 S.W.2d at 444, citing Atonin Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as\nan Essential Element of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U.L.Rev. 881 (1983). The current\nmajority may be the first in the nation to anchor standing on this constitutional theory.\n\nThe authorities addressing the prohibition on advisory opinions cited in support of this proposition,\nof course, in no way implicate the question of standing. This precedent-setting concern with\nadvisory opinions contrasts markedly with the eagerness to issue this very type of writing within\nthe last year. See Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Kirby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1498384\"><a href=\"/opinion/1498384/edgewood-indep-sch-dist-v-kirby/\"><span class=\"volume\">804</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 501 (Tex.1991) (Doggett,\nJ., concurring); Carrollton–Farmers Branch Indep.

Writing on an issue not raised by any party, as the majority reaches out to revise\nthe law of standing today, seems to me the very essence of an “advisory” opinion.\n\nThe second newly-announced constitutional basis is equally ironic—our state's vital guarantee\nthat “[a]ll courts shall be open,” Tex. Const. art. I, § 13, in some inexplicable way, mandates that\nthey be closed to some and requires continual judicial monitoring of all who attempt to enter. No\nauthority of any type is cited for this *470 proposition that “open” courts really means “closed”\ncourts. Nothing in the history or text of the provision justifies this reading nor has any Texas court\npreviously attempted such converse interpretation. This constitutional guarantee is used today as a\ntwo-edged sword: the majority invokes the open courts provision to bar environmental groups from\nseeking judicial assistance in enforcing the laws, while in the very same opinion misinterpreting\nthis provision to allow continued violation of statutes protecting our precious natural resources. 48\n\nThen, with a final flourish, standing is conveniently classified as a nonwaivable component of\nsubject matter jurisdiction. Until today, Texas followed the rule, adopted by many of our sister\nstates considering the issue, that objections to a party's standing are waived if not first raised in\nthe trial court. 49 No Texas case is cited for the proposition that standing is part of nonwaivable\nsubject matter jurisdiction because, until today, this court had repeatedly stated precisely the very\nopposite—that standing is not jurisdictional. 50\n\nTexas has with good reason determined that standing is not excepted from traditional rules of\nappellate procedure. Our appellate system is predicated on the requirement of presentation of\ncomplaints to the lower court coupled with preservation and briefing in the reviewing court.

Appellate courts face considerable difficulties in deciding an issue\nnot presented to the trial court; ordinarily, the necessary facts will not be fully developed. The\nunstated effect of today's opinion is to require trial courts to develop facts as to undisputed issues\nor risk subsequent appellate reversal. This is not an effective use of our limited judicial resources.\n\nThe requirement that issues first be presented to the trial court serves another function—preventing\nparties from “laying behind the log”:\n\n            The reason for the requirement that a litigant preserve a trial predicate for\n            complaint on appeal is that one should not be permitted to waive, consent to,\n            or neglect to complain about an error at trial and then surprise his opponent on\n            appeal by stating his complaint for the first time.\n\nPirtle v.

The first concern is that a strict standing rule is necessary to prevent\ncollusive litigation. Under Texas law, the filing of a fictitious suit constitutes contempt by counsel,\nTex.R.Civ.P. 13, and may serve as the basis for a host of sanctions, including dismissal with\nprejudice. Tex.R.Civ.P. 215 2b(5). Nor does our Texas judiciary lack the ability to reject collusive\nlitigation. Felderhoff v.

This concern is derived\nsolely from the federal law mandate that a federal appellate court is duty-bound to verify not only\nits own jurisdiction but that of the lower courts as well. Federal courts, however, have limited\njurisdiction; Texas courts do not. Our Texas Constitution creates courts of general jurisdiction,\ninvesting them with all of the “judicial power of this State.” Tex. Const. art. V, § 1. The differences\nare evident in our procedural rules. While a federal court must affirmatively ascertain jurisdiction\nover parties appearing before it, a Texas court's jurisdiction is presumed until proven lacking by\na contesting party. See Tex.R.Civ.P. 120a.\n\nLastly, the majority expresses concern as to the res judicata effect on other potential litigants\nof a judgment rendered in the absence of genuine standing. 852 S.W.2d at 445–446.

The majority is unable to point to a single example of\ncollusion during the three decades our Texas rule, which allows the issue of standing to be waived,\nhas been in place. During this period there have likewise been no examples of lower courts making\na grab for extrajurisdictional power, nor of oppressed litigants shackled by the res judicata effect\nof contrived litigation.\n\nIn defining state requirements for standing, we are in no way bound by federal jurisprudence\nfounded upon converse jurisdictional principles from our own.

Wright, 133 U.Pa.L.Rev. 635, 659 (1985) (“One could\nperhaps be forgiven for confusing standing's agenda with that of the New Right.”).\n\nThe benefits of permitting an association to represent the concerns of its members are manifest.\nAs recognized in United Auto Workers, 477 U.S. at 290, 106 S.Ct. at 2533, “[T]he primary reason\npeople join an organization is often to create an effective vehicle for vindicating interests that\nthey share with others.” Judicial economy is promoted when one litigant can, in a single lawsuit,\nadequately represent many members with similar interests, thus avoiding repetitive and costly\nactions. The wider range of resources often available for associations enhances their effectiveness\nin litigation:\n\n  Special features, advantageous both to the individuals represented and to the judicial system as\n  a whole, ... distinguish suits by associations on behalf of their members.... An association suing\n  can draw upon a pre-existing reservoir of expertise and capital. “Besides financial resources,\n  organizations often have specialized expertise and research resources relating to the subject\n  matter of the lawsuit that individual plaintiffs lack.” ... These resources assist both courts and\n  plaintiffs.\n\nId. at 289–90, 106 S.Ct. at 2532–33. In some cases, an injury that is substantial as to many may have\nan individual financial impact too small to make a challenge economically feasible. Associational\nrepresentation may be the only means of redressing conduct when the harm is limited in degree but\nsubstantial segments of society are affected. Additionally, in challenging policies of government,\norganizations are generally less susceptible than individuals to retaliation by the bureaucrats they\nchallenge.\n\nThese benefits are ignored as the majority declares that henceforth the right of associations to bring\nsuit in Texas courts will be constricted by a three-part federal test set forth in Hunt v.

Despite the fact that the\ntwo provisions are vastly different in language, history and purpose, the majority nonetheless\ndetermines to “look to the more extensive jurisprudential experience of the federal courts” to\ndetermine standing.

The suit was dismissed for lack of standing\nbased upon a rigid construction of the requirement of injury to the association's members. This\ndecision has been widely criticized as significantly impairing the ability of public interest groups\nto represent their members, particularly those that seek to protect this nation's environment and\nnatural resources. 58 Today the majority eagerly positions itself to give the same treatment to\nthose Texans who would petition our state courts to protect the public interest. The majority\nnot only conspicuously relies on Lujan, 852 S.W.2d at 445, but also embraces the extremist\nanti-environmental stance propounded in an article openly critical of judicial opinions permitting\ncitizens to complain of harm inflicted upon our natural resources.

Claiming “guidance”\nfrom federal precedent, 852 S.W.2d at 445, the majority overrules all Texas cases treating standing\nas a procedural issue, then unnecessarily modifies all Texas precedent addressing the merits of\nstanding. Without explanation, today's opinion simply photocopies into our Texas law books\nthe federal law of standing with all of its much-criticized complexities.

Conclusion\n\nToday the environment is the immediate victim. Those who pollute our rivers, release toxins into\nour air, and damage our land cannot be promptly penalized. Instead, only after the very slow\nwheels of our judicial system have creaked to a stop will violators of environmental protection\nlaws be held accountable.\n\nYet the environment is not the whole story. Much as a river may seem pure and clear even at the\nplace where illegal sewage is being pumped into it, the danger from a court's opinion may not\nbe immediately apparent on its surface. Only after the reasoning is applied in other cases is the\nseverity of the resulting harm to our system of justice revealed. Today's impairment of the ability\nof concerned citizens to vindicate the rights of many in our courts and the majority's knockout\npunch to the right of trial by jury will unfold in future cases to bar participation of ordinary citizens\nin Texas courts.\n\nThe mess in Texas is not only with our environment but with the misinterpretation of the law.\n\n\nGAMMAGE, Justice, concurring and dissenting.\nThough I would prefer not to write separately, I find I am unable to agree entirely with any single\nopinion of the court's other members.

This is true even if that “judgment” takes the\nform of an administrative agency decision. Administrative agency decisions, for the most part,\nentitle an appellant to only “substantial evidence” as opposed to de novo review. To further burden\nthose regulated with prepayment of the “judgment” as the only alternative to total loss of even\nsubstantial evidence review violates the basic concept of our constitutional open courts in Texas.\n\nAs to the issue (or non-issue) of standing, the majority in effect adopts the position of federal courts\nthat standing is a jurisdictional question. Otherwise it cannot be fundamental error to be addressed\nwhen no party raises it. Standing was not raised and should not be addressed in this cause.\n\nEven assuming standing is an element of subject matter jurisdiction, the court should not write\non the issue in this case. Even though a judgment is void and subject to collateral attack at any\npoint if there is an absence of subject matter jurisdiction, see *477 Mercer v.

Since the majority concludes\nthere was standing in this case, and since no party raised its existence as an issue, there is no reason\nto address it at all, even if it would be fundamental error if lacking.\n\nThe basis for the majority's discussion is its sudden revelation that “[s]tanding is implicit in\nthe concept of subject matter jurisdiction.” 852 S.W.2d at 443. Their opinion then claims this\nimplication comes from the separation of powers doctrine and the open courts provision of the\nTexas Constitution. It is a curiosity of legal scholarship, however, that in the 156 prior years of\nits existence, this court never before found standing “implicit” in those constitutional provisions,\nbut in fact wrote that standing could be waived and hence was not fundamental error.

Justice Doggett's\nopinion adequately addresses why there is no implication from those provisions that standing is\njurisdictional.\n\nThe majority's struggle to put standing in issue whenit is not prompts me to address two statements\nin its opinion which strike me as either misleading or just plain wrong. The majority asserts,\nwithout citation to authority, that “[s]ubject matter jurisdiction is never presumed,” 852 S.W.2d at\n443–444, and in a footnote repeats that assertion in urging that “Justice Doggett confuses subject\nmatter jurisdiction with personal jurisdiction. Only the latter can be waived when uncontested. See\nTEX.R.CIV.P. 120a.” 852 S.W.2d at 444 n. 5.

These remarks\nare made in an attempt to distinguish the cases cited by Justice Doggett from those of other states\nholding that standing is not jurisdictional. I suppose we should be encouraged to find out that there\nare some types of “standing” that will not be jurisdictional, but it occurs to me that by using the term\n“jurisdictional standing” the court is begging the question—if it is jurisdictional, then it must be\nfundamental. The problem is that the Texas cases, at least as I read them, define “standing” in terms\nof “the party's capacity to sue,” 1 which is one example we are given of non-jurisdictional standing.\nThe majority opinion is calculated—no, guaranteed—to cause confusion because apparently this\ncourt will henceforth tell litigants on a case-by-case basis whether the standing problems in their\ncases are “jurisdictional” or merely formal.\n\nThere is no need to create this confusion. The majority's fomenting it, however, requires that I\naddress it to some extent. I will discuss the “subject matter never presumed” proposition first, then\nweave into the “jurisdictional standing” language.\n\nI agree that subject matter jurisdiction is never presumed in one respect. Subject matter jurisdiction\nexists when the nature of the case falls within a general category of cases the court is empowered\nto adjudicate under the applicable constitutional and statutory provisions.

In this sense, there is no\npresumption because if the case is not one over which the court had constitutional and statutory\nauthority to act one does not “presume” subject matter jurisdiction to make it valid. If a justice of\nthe peace grants a divorce, the judgment is void because that is not the type of case the constitution\nand legislature entrusts to that court, and appellate courts will not “presume” the justice court had\njurisdiction in order to make the judgment valid.\n\nBut what the majority addresses here under the rubric of “standing” is not a court assuming\njurisdiction over a type of dispute for which the statutes do not grant it power. The district court\nundoubtedly had jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment and injunction action brought there,\nsince district courts may entertain declaratory judgment and injunction actions. The question of\nstanding the majority gratuitously addresses here is related to an incidental party issue.\n\nThis court has expressly held that some facts or similar matters relating to party issues are\npresumed. For example, for many years the subject matter jurisdiction for certain trial courts\nas set by the statutes has included a jurisdictional amount, sometimes as a minimum amount in\ncontroversy and sometimes as both a maximum and minimum.

The Clean Air Act, the Solid\nWaste Disposal Act, and the Water Quality Act embody this state's commitment to protect the\nenvironment; and the prepayment requirements struck down today were intended to give force\nto that commitment, not to raise revenue. Without the need to prepay administrative penalties,\npolluters will be left with little if any incentive to timely comply with environmental laws and\nregulations.\n\nThe effects of today's decision, though, extend far beyond the statutes at issue in this case. By\nrejecting these prepayment requirements, without regard to the state interest involved, the majority\nhas struck a severe blow to this state's ability to enforce a broad range of regulations in the\npublic interest. The similar statutory provisions identified in the opinion by Justice Doggett, 852\nS.W.2d at 457, cannot be dismissed as minor technicalities; they are carefully-crafted measures\nthat the legislature considered vital to protect the public from recalcitrant lawbreakers. Casting\nthose provisions aside will seriously disrupt the effective operation of our state government.\n\nThe Texas Constitution cannot be construed in absolutes. The basic right of access to the courts\nmust be balanced against the need to protect the public's health and safety. While the restriction at\nissue in this case may be substantial, I would hold that the public's interest in clean air and water,\ncombined with the due process afforded to TAB's members in the administrative process, tips the\nbalance in favor of the prepayment requirement. I therefore dissent.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The League of Women Voters and the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club intervened in the suit and were aligned as defendants with\n        the Texas Air Control Board and the Texas Water Commission. Justice Doggett contends that the standing of the Intervenors should\n        be addressed along with TAB's. We disagree. Standing concerns a party's faculty to invoke the court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n        Once it has been invoked by a plaintiff, a court's subject matter jurisdiction is not affected by the status of defendants or intervenors\n        aligned in interest with defendants.\n2       Act of June 14, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 637, § 33, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 2350, 2359 (amending Texas Clean Air Act codified\n        at TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 4.041 (Vernon 1976), currently codified as amended at TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §\n        382.088; Act of June 15, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 795, § 6.001, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 2719, 2813 (amending Solid Waste Disposal Act\n        codified at TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 4477–7 (Vernon 1976), currently codified as amended at TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY\n        CODE § 361.252; Act of June 15, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 795, § 5.007, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 2719, 2806 (amending TEX.WATER\n        CODE § 26.136).\n3       Although some amendments have been adopted since, they are not relevant to the issue presented in this case. See Diana C. Dutton,\n        ENVIRONMENTAL, 45 SW.

Only the latter can be waived when uncontested. See\n        TEX.R.CIV.P. 120a.\n6       The analysis is the same under the federal constitution. See e.g. Correspondence of the Justices, Letter from Chief Justice John Jay\n        and the Associate Justices to President George Washington, August 8, 1793 in Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 73\n        n. 3 (2nd ed. 1988).\n7       Of the states listed by Justice Doggett, only Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, New York, South Dakota, and perhaps Ohio, Pennsylvania and\n        Washington actually treat jurisdictional standing as waivable.

From his harsh critique of the doctrine, it seems that he not only objects to the conclusion that standing\n      cannot be waived but also to the conclusion that standing is a requirement to initiate a lawsuit.\n9     Texas Industrial Traffic League relied on two cases to support its holding that standing cannot be raised for the first time on appeal:\n      Coffee v. William Marsh Rice University, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2456695\"><a href=\"/opinion/2456695/coffee-v-william-marsh-rice-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341 (Tex.1966), and Sabine River Authority v.

We need not overrule these two cases, however, because unlike Texas Industrial Traffic League, we believe that\n      standing was present in the trial court in these cases. Our concern is with a party's right to initiate a lawsuit and the trial court's\n      corresponding power to hear the case ab initio. Standing is determined at the time suit is filed in the trial court, and subsequent events\n      do not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction.

We disagree. These cases hold that matters not raised in the trial court are waived. One exception noted\n      by these decisions, however, is a lack of jurisdiction which may be raised by a party, or the court, for the first time on appeal. Justice\n      Doggett does not believe that standing falls within that exception because he contends that standing is not jurisdictional.\n11    In most other jurisdictions, such prepayment provisions are required only to stay execution of judgments and are not prerequisites\n      to the right to appeal itself. See Gary Stein, Expanding the Due Process Rights of Indigent Litigants: Will Texaco Trickle Down?,\n      61 N.Y.U.L. REV. 463, 469 (1986).\n12    Thus, contrary to Justice Doggett's reading of our opinion, the Sax test is inapplicable.\n\n13    The Clean Air Act was implemented to “safeguard the state's air resources from pollution by controlling or abating air pollution\n      and emissions of air contaminants....” TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.002(a). The Texas Water Code was implemented to\n      “maintain the quality of water in the state consistent with the public health and enjoyment ...” TEX.WATER CODE § 26.003.\n14    The importance is evidenced by article XVI, section 59(a) of our constitution, which provides in relevant part that: “The conservation\n      and development of all the natural resources of this State ... and the preservation and conservation of all such natural resources ... are\n      each and all ... public rights and duties.” TEX. CONST. art. XVI, § 59(a).\n15    If the person charged does not make payment or post bond within thirty days, the agency may forward the matter to the attorney\n      general for enforcement. TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.089(c), § 361.252(m); TEX.WATER CODE § 26.136(k).\n16    It has been argued that our procedure of allowing immediate enforcement of trial court judgments violates federal due process when\n      the judgment debtor is financially unable to post a supersedeas bond and immediate enforcement will cause irreparable injury.

A similar\n      argument could be fashioned under the Texas open courts provision, but TAB does not assert that argument here. TAB's open courts\n      challenge centers not on the requirement of immediate payment, but on the forfeiture of judicial review if payment is not made.\n17    Thus, contrary to Justice Doggett's assertion, we do not strike down the penalties themselves. Nothing in this opinion prohibits the\n      state's collection of assessed penalties. We hold as violative of our open courts provision only the requirement that the penalties be\n      paid as a condition to judicial review. Furthermore, nothing in our opinion requires that penalties already paid be refunded.\n18    That the affected parties may be able to afford prepayment is irrelevant. The guarantee of constitutional rights should not depend\n      on the balance in one's bank account.\n19    TAB claims that the lack of a jury trial before the agency as well as the lack of a trial de novo violate article I, section 15. We limit\n      our inquiry to the absence of a trial de novo because, as this court has said: “Trial by jury cannot be claimed in an inquiry that is non-\n      judicial in its character, or with respect to proceedings before an administrative board.” Middleton v.

StarTex\nagreed to supply Triton with electricity, and Triton agreed to pay at a fixed rate for a term of twelve\nmonths. Regarding invoicing and payment, the ESA provided that\n\n             [StarTex] shall render to Customer [Triton] on a monthly basis, or as mutually\n             agreed by [StarTex] and Customer but not less frequent than monthly, an invoice\n             that is due and payable fifteen (15) days from the date of the invoice. If the\n             payment of all undisputed amounts is not received by the due date, Customer\n             will be charged a late fee equal to five percent (5%) of the past due amount.\n             Customer must provide to [StarTex] written notice setting forth in particular\n             detail any disputed amount, including the calculations with respect to any errors\n             or inaccuracies claimed. If it is subsequently determined that Customer owes\n             [StarTex] any portion of the disputed amount, Customer shall remit to [StarTex]\n             within five (5) business days following such resolution the outstanding balance\n             plus interest .... Any amounts that may have been overpaid or underpaid shall\n             be applied to the next monthly invoice.\n\nThe ESA also contained the following language:\n\n   Early Termination Fee. In the event that Customer terminates this agreement or Customer\n   defaults as described [below], then an Early Termination Fee will be assessed. The Early\n   Termination Fee shall be equal to the greater of a) the three months highest bills for Customer or\n   b) any mark to market costs. For purposes of this fee the mark to market costs shall be calculated\n   by multiplying the difference between the initial cost of power procured to satisfy the ESA and\n   the final net liquidated value of said power at the time of termination by the total amount of\n   power procured from the Customer Location for the remainder of the original term of the ESA....\n\n   ....\n\n   Customer Acknowledgments.

This eventually led to Triton's terminating\nits contract with StarTex in October 2008 and seeking electricity from a different retail electricity\nprovider.\n\nOn September 14, 2009, StarTex filed suit against Triton alleging breach of contract, and, in\nthe alternative, suit on a sworn account and quantum meruit. StarTex asserted that Triton owed\nit $319,094.11, consisting of unpaid utility service and contractual fees, interest, and liquidated\ndamages. StarTex also sought attorney's fees under Civil Practice and Remedies Code chapter\n38.

Triton generally denied StarTex's allegations and asserted\nthat the liquidated damages provision was invalid and unenforceable and that the attorney's fees\nsought were not reasonable and necessary.\n\nTriton also asserted that\n\n             the account on which [StarTex] sues ... is not just and true, and all just and\n             lawful offsets, payments, and credits have not been applied to [Triton's] account.\n             [Triton] does not owe [StarTex] $319,094.11 in damages, because [StarTex]\n             seeks to recover $197,323.95 in damages based on an invalid liquidated damages\n             provision. Furthermore, based on the inaccuracies in [StarTex's] billing and\n             estimates since 2007, [Triton] also challenge[s] [StarTex's] allegation that [it\n             owes] $105,034.18 to [StarTex] for services rendered.\n\nAttached to its answer, Triton provided the affidavit of Bill Bird, who averred:\n\n             I am responsible for and have knowledge of Triton's business dealings with\n             Plaintiff [StarTex]. Triton began doing business with Plaintiff in 2006. In the\n             summer of 2007, Plaintiff began providing usage estimates to Triton, which\n             reflected very high usage. Triton brought this issue to Plaintiff's attention,\n             and the *50 issue was not resolved. Triton contests the validity of Plaintiff's\n             account, and denies that it owes $105,034.18 to Plaintiff for services rendered.\n\nOn January 20, 2010, StarTex moved for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim.\nStarTex argued that the parties had a valid contract and that the First and Second Amendments of\nthe contract required Triton to pay for the electricity received under the MCPE pricing schedule\nthrough May 2011. Copies of the ESA and First and Second Amendments were attached as\nsummary judgment evidence. StarTex stated that “[t]he MCPE is a variable rate plan wherein the\nprice changes every fifteen (15) minutes to reflect the supply and demand for power in a particular\nmarket.”\n\nStarTex argued,\n\n             Due to the numerous price changes involved in an MCPE contract, StarTex\n             had to customize its purchase to fit the particular consumption needs of Triton.\n             Every customer's consumption needs differ, and StarTex must carefully time\n             its purchases so that it has sufficient power for the customer during their peak\n             usage hours and so that it does not over-purchase during down times.

Therefore, in order to service Triton's Contract,\n             not only did StarTex commit to purchase sufficient power to cover the life of\n             the Contract, but it also committed to make purchases every fifteen (15) minutes\n             that mirror the kWh used by Triton during each fifteen (15) minute interval.\n\nThis argument was supported by the affidavit of Stephen Madden, the Senior Vice–President of\nSupply for StarTex.\n\nStarTex asserted that it provided power to Triton throughout the term of the contract and submitted\ninvoices to Triton “based on meter reads performed by CenterPoint Energy (“CenterPoint”), the\nTransmission and/or Distribution Services Provider (“TDSP”) for the Houston area.” StarTex\nfurther argued that:\n\n             On several occasions, StarTex was required to generate [Triton's] monthly\n             invoice using estimated reads based on historical usage. This was a result of\n             CenterPoint being unable to gain access to [Triton's] meters to obtain the actual\n             usage amounts. All such estimated reads were reconciled on subsequent invoices\n             once CenterPoint obtained access to the meters, such that the final invoice\n             reflected only actual usage. All estimated reads and subsequent reconciliations\n             were detailed on [Triton's] monthly invoices.\n\nStarTex provided invoices and the affidavit of Robert Verhage, the Director of Credit and\nCollections for StarTex, substantiating these arguments. Verhage averred that the invoices\nattached as summary judgment evidence were true and correct copies of Triton's monthly invoices.\nVerhage testified that, after Triton terminated the ESA on approximately October 19, 2008,\n“StarTex generated one final invoice that contained the final, outstanding balance that was\nreconciled to correct all estimated reads.” The final invoice reflected that Triton owed $155,034.18,\nand Verhage averred that Triton subsequently made $50,000.00 in payments, leaving $105,034.18\ndue and owing. Thus, StarTex argued that Triton breached the ESA *51 when it failed to pay for\n$105,034.18 worth of electricity provided under the ESA and subsequent amendments.\n\nStarTex also asserted that Triton breached the ESA when it terminated the ESA early. StarTex\nstated in its motion, and Madden averred in his affidavit, that when StarTex entered into the Second\nAmendment extending the terms of the ESA through May 2011, it contracted with the electricity\nproducer “to purchase enough power to service the entire thirty-six (36) month term of the Second\nAmendment and the purchases were tailored to fit Triton's particular ‘shape’.” Thus, the ESA\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It\nargued that, under its fee agreement with its counsel, it would incur attorney's fees “in an amount\nequal to twenty-five percent (25%) of all amounts recovered from [Triton],” or $75,589.36, and\nthat this amount was reasonable and necessary. The summary judgment motion was accompanied\nby the affidavit of Rodney Drinnon, counsel for StarTex, who averred to the specific services\nprovided by his firm and stated that the services described were reasonable and necessary and that\n“twenty-five percent (25%) is a reasonable contingency fee for the services provided.”\n\nOn January 28, 2010, Triton amended its answer, adding claims that StarTex “materially breached\nthe contract, which was modified by agreement,” that Triton “complied with the terms of the\nmodified contract,” that Triton was “discharged from performing under the contract after [StarTex]\nmaterially breached same,” and that StarTex failed “to mitigate its damages as required under\napplicable law, limitation of warranty, limitation of liability, laches, and waiver.” Triton also\nsought a continuance of the summary judgment hearing, which the trial court granted.\n\nOn April 5, 2010, Triton responded to StarTex's summary judgment motion. Triton did not contest\nStarTex's statements that the ESA and subsequent amendments were valid contracts. However,\nTriton asserted that StarTex “made several promises to [Triton] and [orally] modified the terms of\nthe parties' agreements.” Triton argued that Michael Gary, Triton's property manager, “had several\ndiscussions with John Bejger, a representative of StarTex, relating to StarTex's estimated usage\nand Triton's disputes over *52 the StarTex invoices.” As supported by Gary's affidavit in Triton's\nsummary judgment evidence, Gary represented to Bejger that the practice of estimating electricity\nusage for several consecutive months was causing damage to Triton because Triton could not\nbill its tenants based on estimated billing. Gary also averred that Triton had “done everything\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               8\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v.

Triton's response asserted that Gary's affidavit about his discussions\nwith Bejger raised a disputed issue of material fact as to whether there was a meeting of the minds\nin reaching a valid modification.\n\nTriton also argued that it was excused from performing under the ESA based on StarTex's material\nbreach of the agreements “when it failed to provide [Triton] with accurate and correct billings for\nthe electricity that it actually delivered.” Triton's motion referenced the invoices sent by StarTex\nand provided details regarding which specific invoices were based on estimated usage, including\nseveral instances in which it was invoiced based on estimated usage in consecutive months.\n\nTriton presented Gary's affidavit, averring that Gary first contacted StarTex to resolve the\nbilling problems during the original term of the ESA and that StarTex responded by saying\nthat CenterPoint could not access and read the electricity meters in Triton's buildings. Triton\nincluded in its summary judgment evidence various e-mails between Gary and StarTex in which\nGary raised questions and disputes over the amounts billed in the invoices and StarTex provided\ninformation reconciling its charges. Gary's e-mails did not contain any specific calculations or\namounts with regard to the alleged errors or inaccuracies. StarTex's e-mail reflects that it sent\nTriton a spreadsheet demonstrating how StarTex reconciled the bills and comparing Triton's\nusage and rates. Triton also included an e-mail from CenterPoint to StarTex, received in response\nto StarTex's inquiry regarding the difficulty of getting actual meter readings. The CenterPoint\nrepresentative stated,\n\n             I disagree that CenterPoint is at fault for the estimations. Triton does not provide\n             us unencumbered, permanent, ongoing access to our meters. The estimation\n             reasons are specific to each address, but on some accounts Triton has their meters\n             locked inside a mechanical room to which we're supposed to go track down\n             an employee and a key, apparently unsuccessfully at times, perhaps because\n             the right employee can't be found. On other accounts, we're supposed to enter\n             through a locked gate where the gate code we have on record has been changed.\n             Triton has a responsibility to keep us updated if access arrangements change.\n\nTriton's summary judgment evidence also included the affidavit of Jim Phillips, the Vice President\nof IEA Engineering, an energy engineering company. Phillips stated that he reviewed StarTex's\nbilling invoices and Triton's historical electricity usage. He averred that he found\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

These\n   errors include, without limitation:\n\n   • several errors in math (multiplication of energy consumption by the cost of energy);\n\n   • excessive estimated energy readings;\n\n   • estimated energy readings at one site (meter) while the next site (meter) was actually read in\n      the same month, again repeatedly;\n\n   • three meters had a monthly load factor greater than 100%, which is an impossibility (LF is\n      the maximum demand used over hours of the month—over 100% is more hours than in that\n      month);\n\n   • several examples where the ending energy reading of one month did not match the beginning\n      reading of the next month;\n\n   • energy costs are not consistent across meters in the same month;\n\n   • multiple corrections from earlier months' estimated energy reading make analysis difficult; and\n\n   • it is improbable that back to back months would have the same exact energy consumption\n      readings and that demand would remain the same for several months in a row.\n\nPhillips provided his opinion about other errors and problems with StarTex's billing practices,\nwithout providing specific contested amounts, and concluded:\n\n             In summary, the total value of the errors I analyzed came to almost $97,000.00.\n             This is not an inclusive value and with additional time to review the invoices\n             and billing, this amount should significantly increase. The numbers and values\n             I used assume that StarTex's numbers were correct; however, I found that some\n             of these numbers and values were not correct when compared to each other. To\n             this amount and the other uncalculated errors, taxes must be added since they\n             are a percentage of the energy and [TDSP] charges. The error value is therefore\n             compounded.\n\nThus, Triton argued that it “created a fact issue on each element of [its] affirmative defense” of\nprior material breach and that it raised a fact issue regarding whether StarTex conclusively proved\nthe proper amount of damages.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

StarTex presented the affidavit of John\nBejger, contesting Gary's representations that the parties entered *54 into an oral modification\nof their agreement. StarTex also argued that, “because the TDSP [CenterPoint], not StarTex, is\nsolely authorized by the State of Texas to provide actual and estimated readings [,] Bejger would\nnot have made” any representations regarding discontinuing the use of estimated meter readings in\nthe monthly invoices. Finally, StarTex argued that the parties entered into the Second Amendment\nafter the alleged oral representations and thus Triton's argument that Texas law allows modification\nof a written agreement by later oral representations was inapplicable.\n\nStarTex also argued that it did not breach the ESA. Specifically, StarTex argued that Phillips,\nTriton's energy engineer expert, did not specifically identify any breach by StarTex. StarTex\nargued that it was permitted by the ESA and Texas law to bill Triton based on estimated usage;\nthat, under the terms of the ESA, it is irrelevant why CenterPoint provided Triton's estimated usage\nrather than actual usage; and that Triton did not follow the contractual provisions requiring it to\npay undisputed portions of the invoice and to set forth in detail “calculations with respect to any\nerrors or inaccuracies claims.”\n\nStarTex again argued that the liquidated damages provision was enforceable. Finally, StarTex\nargued that its original demand to Triton was not excessive, and thus that ground did not preclude\nit from recovering attorney's fees.\n\nOn April 16, 2010, following the summary judgment hearing, Triton filed its “Supplemental\nResponse” to StarTex's summary judgment motion.

Triton also\nobjected to the affidavit of John Bejger, attached to StarTex's reply to Triton's response.\n\nOn April 26, 2010, the trial court granted StarTex's motion. The trial court's order stated that it\nconsidered “the Motion, the response, the pleadings, the affidavits, other evidence on file with\nthe Court, and arguments of counsel.” The trial court awarded StarTex $105,034.18 “as actual\ndamages for [Triton's] failure to pay for electricity provided by [StarTex].” The trial court awarded\nStarTex $197,323.25 “as liquidated damages for [Triton's] early termination of the [ESA].”\nFinally, the trial court awarded StarTex $12,000 as reasonable and necessary attorney's fees, as\nwell as additional attorney's fees conditioned on an unsuccessful appeal by Triton.\n\nOn May 12, 2010, StarTex moved for a turnover order.\n\nOn May 25, 2010, Triton moved for reconsideration or a new trial. Triton supported this motion\nwith new affidavits from Jim Phillips, Michael Gary, and Montague Morgan, attorney for Triton,\nwho attempted to authenticate documents attached to Phillips' affidavit. StarTex objected to and\nmoved to strike these affidavits on the ground that Triton did not timely file them and on the\nground that Gary's affidavit was not based on his personal knowledge and was made in bad faith.\nThe trial court granted StarTex's motion and struck the affidavits of Phillips, Gary, and Morgan\nthat were attached to Triton's motion for new trial. 1\n\n *55 On June 21, 2010, the trial court denied Triton's motion for reconsideration/new trial and\nstated that it did not consider the stricken affidavits. On July 6, 2010, the trial court signed a\nmodified order stating:\n\n   On this day, after hearing [Triton's] Motion for Reconsideration/New Trial (“Motion”), the\n   Court, relying solely [on] the summary judgment evidence on file, arguments of counsel and\n   without considering the stricken, untimely supplement filed by [Triton], is of the opinion that\n   [Triton's] Motion should be, in all things, DENIED.\n\n   It is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that [Triton's] Motion is denied and\n   that the Court's order of April 26, 2010, granting Plaintiff's Traditional Motion for Summary\n   Judgment is hereby, in all things, REAFFIRMED.\n\nOn July 28, 2010, the trial court signed an order granting StarTex's motion for a turnover order\nand appointing a receiver.

When reviewing a motion for summary judgment, we take\nthe nonmovant's evidence as true, indulge every reasonable inference in favor of the nonmovant,\nand resolve all doubts in favor of the nonmovant. Id.\n\nIn its first through seventh issues, Triton argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\njudgment in favor of StarTex on its breach of contract claim. The trial court awarded StarTex\nsummary judgment on both grounds of StarTex's breach of contract claim against Triton: that\nTriton breached (1) by failing to pay the invoices for electricity provided and (2) by wrongfully\nterminating the contract early.\n\n\nB. Summary Judgment on StarTex's Breach of Contract Claim for Triton's Failure to Pay\nfor Invoiced Electricity\nIn its first and second issues, Triton argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\nbecause it misinterpreted and misapplied the law applicable to StarTex's breach of contract claim\nand to Triton's defenses. In its third issue, Triton argues that StarTex's summary *56 judgment\nevidence did not establish that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\n [6] [7] To prevail on a breach of contract claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) the existence of a valid\ncontract; (2) the plaintiff's performance or tender of performance; (3) the defendant's breach of\ncontract; and (4) the plaintiff's damages as a result of the breach.

Evidence Establishing Elements of StarTex's Claim\nAttached to its summary judgment motion, StarTex included copies of the ESA and First and\nSecond Amendments. Neither party disputes that these documents constitute a valid contract\nbetween them.\n\nStarTex also provided summary judgment evidence, including multiple invoices and the affidavits\nof two corporate representatives, that it provided electricity to Triton. Triton does not dispute that\nStarTex provided it with electricity up until Triton terminated the ESA.\n\nStarTex provided invoices and affidavits demonstrating that Triton owed $105,034.18 under the\nunpaid invoices. The account summary on the final invoice showed that Triton owed $155,034.18\nas of November 15, 2008. Verhage's affidavit testimony provided that Triton subsequently made\n$50,000.00 in payments, leaving $105,034.18 due and owing.\n\n[8] We conclude that StarTex conclusively established its right to recover $105,034.18 from\nTriton for Triton's breach of contract by failing to pay the invoices. Thus, the burden shifted to\nTriton to respond to the motion for summary judgment and present evidence raising a fact issue\non at least one of the elements of StarTex's claim or to present a valid defense. See Willrich, 28\nS.W.3d at 23.\n\n\n2. Triton's Response\nIn its fourth issue, Triton argues that it presented summary judgment evidence controverting\nStarTex's evidence and raising genuine issues of material fact as to one or more elements of\nStarTex's breach of contract claim. Triton does not dispute that StarTex provided electricity to its\nbuildings throughout the term of the contract up until Triton terminated the agreement. Neither\ndoes Triton dispute that it did not pay amounts invoiced by StarTex for the electricity provided.\nHowever, Triton disputes (1) the terms of the contract as presented by StarTex, alleging that the\nparties orally modified their agreement; (2) StarTex's satisfactory performance under the contract\nand its own excuse from performance by StarTex's prior material breach; (3) the sufficiency of\nStarTex's evidence to support the amount of damages awarded by the trial court; and (4) the trial\ncourt's implicit determination that it was not entitled to any offsets or credits.\n\n\n\n                              (a) The alleged oral modification of the contract\n\nTriton argues that, according to Gary's affidavit testimony, the agreement between the parties was\norally modified by representations Bejger made prior to execution of the Second Amendment that\ninvoices based on estimated usage would no longer be used. Gary testified that he *57 represented\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                14\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v.

Gary averred that Bejger represented that the\nerrors would be corrected, that StarTex was attempting to resolve the allegations that CenterPoint\ndid not have access to Triton's meters, and “that StarTex's previous practice of estimating usage\nof consecutive months would not continue.” Gary stated that Triton entered into the Second\nAmendment based on these representations by Bejger. Thus, on appeal, Triton argues that it agreed\nto the Second Amendment “only after receiving assurances that the billing errors and repeated use\nof estimated billing would be addressed and corrected by [StarTex].”\n\n [9] [10] A written agreement not required by law to be in writing may be modified by a later\noral agreement.

The materiality of a breach—the question of whether a party's breach of a contract will\nrender the contract unenforceable—generally presents a dispute for resolution by the trier of fact.\nId. Here, however, because we determine that StarTex's actions did not breach the contract as a\nmatter of law, we need not consider whether Triton raised a fact issue on materiality.\n\n [20] To raise a material fact issue on every element of its affirmative defense, Triton had to raise\na fact question on StarTex's prior breach of contract. Triton argues that StarTex's use of estimated\nbilling was not proper under the contract because StarTex did not establish that the conditions\nprecedent to using estimated billing had occurred because StarTex did not prove that CenterPoint\nwas unable to access Triton's meters.\n\nThe ESA provides:\n\n   Customer Acknowledgments.

This contract provision is consistent with the legislatively mandated\ndivision of business activities in the electric utility market. See TEX. UTIL.CODE ANN. §\n39.051(b) (providing that electricity utilities must separate their business activities into three units\n—power generation company, retail electric provider, and transmission and distribution utility);\nTex. Indus. Energy Consumers, 324 S.W.3d at 97–98 *59 (observing that transmission and\ndistribution service providers are responsible for providing metering services).\n\nStarTex provided the affidavit of Robert Verhage, who averred that, on several occasions, it had\nto rely on estimated usage because CenterPoint did not provide Triton's actual meter usage. The\nsummary judgment evidence also contained an e-mail from a CenterPoint representative stating\nthat Triton was to blame for CenterPoint's failure to obtain actual meter readings. This e-mail\nshows that CenterPoint acknowledged that it provided StarTex with estimated usage rather than\nactual readings on several occasions and that StarTex was not at fault for CenterPoint's inability\nto access and read the meters.\n\nThe ESA expressly permits invoicing based on estimated usage. Triton did not present any\nsummary judgment evidence that StarTex used estimates in its invoices on occasions when\nCenterPoint had provided actual meter readings. Thus, this argument is without merit.\n\n [21] Triton also argues that, even if StarTex was permitted to use estimates in invoicing Triton\nfor its electricity usage, StarTex was required to reconcile any charges based on estimated usage\non the next bill. However, the plain language of the contract provides that StarTex must reconcile\nthe estimated usage with the actual usage “[a]s soon as practical, and after receipt of Customer's\nEnergy Consumption and settlement charges from the TDSP.” Triton's argument that the actual\nusage was required to be reconciled on the next month's bill is not supported by the plain language\nof the contract.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that Triton has not raised a fact issue on any element of its claim that\nStarTex committed a prior material breach of the contract.\n\n\n\n                                (c) StarTex's alleged failure to prove damages\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thus, Triton argues that StarTex failed to prove its damages as a matter of law.\n\nStarTex acknowledges that it used estimates in some of its bills, and we have already concluded\nthat it was permitted to do so by the plain language of the contract. Furthermore, StarTex presented\nthe actual invoices it sent Triton and Verhage's affidavit stating that the final invoice relied on in\ncalculating the amount due and owing “contained the final, outstanding balance that was reconciled\nto correct all estimated reads.”\n\nTriton presented Gary's affidavit testimony that he disputed several invoices and objected to\nnumerous charges. It also presented e-mail correspondence between Gary, Triton's property\nmanager, and StarTex, in which Gary made general objections to several invoices without\nproviding specific amounts or portions of the invoices that he believed were inaccurate. Triton also\npresented an expert affidavit pointing out general complaints about the invoices without specifying\nparticular amounts in controversy.\n\nTriton argues that StarTex was legally obligated to address Triton's objections to StarTex's billing\npractices before collecting on the unpaid invoices and that this evidence raises a fact question\nregarding the amount Triton owed to StarTex.\n\n [22] The contract provides a method for disputing charges on invoices. The ESA provides that the\n“Customer must provide to [StarTex] written notice setting forth in particular detail any disputed\n *60 amount, including the calculations with respect to any errors or inaccuracies claimed.” The\nrecord contains no evidence that Triton complied with this procedure. Neither Gary's and Phillips'\naffidavit testimony nor the e-mails sent to StarTex contain specific amounts or calculations. Triton\ndid not produce any evidence that it provided StarTex with written notice articulating the particular\ndisputed amount or calculations regarding claimed inaccuracies.\n\nThus, Triton failed to present evidence raising a fact issue on the accuracy of the invoices StarTex\nused to support its claim for the unpaid amounts for electricity usage.\n\n\n\n                                 (d) Triton's entitlement to offsets and credits\n\nTriton also argues that it was entitled to $97,000 in offsets and credits, based on Phillips' affidavit.\n\n [23] “The right of offset is an affirmative defense.” Brown v.

Thus, Triton must present evidence raising a fact question on its offset\ndefense to defeat StarTex's motion for summary judgment. See Am.

However,\nas we have already stated, Triton did not provide a proper challenge to any particular charge or\ninvoice. Phillip's conclusory statements in his affidavit, by themselves, do not support Triton's\nclaim for offsets and credits. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(f) (providing that supporting affidavit must\nset forth facts that would be admissible in evidence); Wadewitz v.

The trial court did not err in\ndetermining that Triton was entitled to summary judgment on this issue as a matter of law.\n\n\nC. Summary Judgment on StarTex's Breach of Contract Claim for Triton's Early\nTermination of the Contract\nIn parts of its first through seventh issues, Triton also argues that the trial court erred in granting\nsummary judgment on StarTex's breach of contract claim for Triton's wrongful early termination\nof the agreement.\n\n\n1. Evidence Establishing Elements of StarTex's Claim\nAs we have discussed, StarTex established the existence of a valid contract between itself and\nTriton, and it established that it performed under that contract. StarTex provided a copy of the\nSecond Amendment, which provided that the parties agreed to extend the ESA through May 2011.\n\nThe ESA contained the following early termination provision:\n\n   Early Termination Fee. In the event that Customer terminates this agreement *61 or Customer\n   defaults as described [in the ESA], then an Early Termination Fee will be assessed. The Early\n   Termination Fee shall be equal to the greater of a) the three months highest bills for Customer\n   or b) any mark to market costs.\n\nStarTex presented Verhage's affidavit testimony that Triton terminated the agreement on October\n10, 2008, approximately thirty-one months earlier than the Second Amendment's contractual\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   19\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v.

Madden averred that when StarTex entered into the Second Amendment extending\nthe terms of the ESA through May 2011, it contracted with its electricity producer “to purchase\nenough power to service the entire thirty-six (36) month term of the Second Amendment and the\npurchases were tailored to fit Triton's particular ‘shape’.” After Triton unilaterally terminated the\ncontract on October 10, 2008, StarTex was still obligated to continue to purchase power from its\nsupplier through May 2011 “in Triton's particular ‘shape,’ ” even though StarTex no longer had a\ncustomer to whom to sell it. Madden testified that it was almost impossible to sell that electricity\nto another customer because StarTex “would have to find a new customer who not only wants\nan MCPE contract, but has the exact same term and volume requirements and ‘shape’ as Triton.”\nAccording to Madden, these particular characteristics of a MCPE payment arrangement made it\nvery difficult to calculate the mark-to-market losses because StarTex had no way of knowing what\nthe exact cost of the future electricity would be. StarTex thus calculated its liquidated damages as\n$197,323.25 based on the sum of Triton's three highest monthly bills.\n\n\n2. Triton's response\nTriton does not contest that it terminated the contract in October 2008, approximately thirty-one\nmonths before the termination date provided in the Second Amendment. Triton again argues that\nits early termination was excused by StarTex's prior breach by billing based on estimated usage.\nWe have already concluded that StarTex did not breach the ESA when it invoiced Triton based\non its estimated usage.\n\nTriton also raises several issues specific to the early termination clause and the trial court's award\nof liquidated damages. In its ninth issue, Triton argues that the early termination fee clause is\nunenforceable as an impermissible penalty. Triton argues in its tenth and eleventh issues that\neven if the early termination fee clause is enforceable as a matter of law, StarTex did not present\nsummary judgment evidence establishing the amount of the early termination fee in compliance\nwith the contract's terms.\n\n\n\n                                (a) Enforceability of early termination clause\n\nTriton argues that the early termination fee clause constitutes an impermissible penalty. Triton\nargues that it is impermissible both under the common law standard set out in Phillips v.

Valid liquidated damages clauses “fix\nin advance the compensation to a party accruing from the failure to *62 perform specified\ncontractual obligations.” Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d at 664. To enforce a liquidated damages clause,\nthe court must find that (1) the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation\nand (2) the amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788; GPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2546332\"><a href=\"/opinion/2546332/gpa-holding-v-baylor-health-care-sys/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 475\n(Tex.App.-Dallas 2011, pet. denied). The party asserting that the provision is unenforceable bears\nthe burden of proof. GPA Holding, 344 S.W.3d at 475.\n\n [29] Triton argues that the harm caused by its breach is not incapable or difficult of estimation.\nTriton argues that StarTex “could determine the amount of electricity that would have been\npurchased by Triton but for the purported breach ... and determine what the electricity was sold for\nto an alternate customer versus what it would have been sold for to Triton.” However, StarTex's\nSenior Vice–President of Supply, Stephen Madden, provided affidavit testimony that it is almost\nimpossible to know what the cost of Triton's future energy use would have been because of the\nconstantly fluctuating prices involved in the MCPE pricing structure. He averred that the price\nof electricity changes as often as every fifteen minutes, that StarTex committed to buy electricity\nin fifteen minute increments to meet its obligation to provide electricity conforming to Triton's\nunique “shape” of energy consumption, and thus it would be very difficult to find another consumer\nto use that energy. Accordingly, it was not possible to determine, at the time of Triton's early\ntermination, the cost of the energy that would have been purchased by Triton but for the breach,\nand it was also very difficult for StarTex to predict whether it would find another consumer to\npurchase the electricity according to Triton's unique usage pattern, and if so, how much such a\nconsumer would pay.\n\nTriton did not present any evidence regarding the parties' ability to estimate actual damages when\nthe contract was formed, and it did not controvert Madden's description of the pricing model\napplicable to the ESA and Second Amendment. Thus, we conclude that it was impossible to\ndetermine the actual harm that would be caused by early termination. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d\nat 788.\n\nTriton also appears to argue that the amount of the liquidated damages was not a reasonable\nforecast of StarTex's actual damages because it was unreasonably large. The ESA provided that\nthe early termination fee “shall be equal to the greater of a) the three months highest bills for\nCustomer or b) any mark to market costs.” In this instance, due to the length of the term remaining\non the terminated contract and the uncertainties of pricing, the “mark to market costs” could not\nbe calculated. Thus, Madden testified that StarTex calculated its damages based on Triton's three\nhighest monthly bills, which totaled $197,323.25.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thus, we conclude that, when viewed as of the time the contract was executed, the ESA's\nmethod for calculating the amount of liquidated damages provided a reasonable forecast of just\ncompensation. See id.\n\n [31] This same reasoning also demonstrates that Triton failed to show that the early termination\nfee violated Business and Commerce Code section 2.718. Section 2.718 provides that a liquidated\ndamages clause is unenforceable if (1) the *63 agreed amount is unreasonable in light of the\nanticipated or actual harm caused by breach, (2) the proof of actual harm is not difficult, (3)\nobtaining an adequate remedy for breach is not inconvenient or not feasible, or (4) the agreed\namount is unreasonably large. See TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.718 (Vernon 2009).\nAs we have already discussed, the proof of actual harm is difficult, and obtaining an adequate\nremedy for breach is not feasible because StarTex could not have calculated the future cost of\nthe electricity, nor could it predict the extent to which it could mitigate its damages. And, the\nagreed amount was not unreasonably large or unreasonable in light of the anticipated or actual\nharm. StarTex was obligated to buy thirty-one months' worth of electricity that it had no ability\nto resell. In that light, liquidated damages calculated from Triton's three highest monthly invoices\nare not unreasonable.\n\nTriton failed to raise a fact question on its claim that the early termination fee clause constituted\nan impermissible penalty.\n\n\n\n                                   (b) StarTex's proof of liquidated damages\n\nTriton also argues that StarTex failed to prove the amount of liquidated damages permitted under\nthe ESA. Several of Triton's arguments on this issue again challenge the accuracy of StarTex's\nbilling and StarTex's use of estimates in its invoices. However, we have already determined that\nTriton has failed to raise a fact question regarding the accuracy or propriety of StarTex's invoices.\nThus, we do not address those arguments again.\n\nTriton argues that StarTex failed to identify which three invoices it relied on in calculating the\nliquidated damages. It also argues that no three invoices from the term of the Second Amendment\nadd up to $197,323.95, and, thus, StarTex improperly used invoices dated prior to the execution\nof the Second Amendment to calculate the early termination fee. However, the early termination\nfee provision did not limit the time period from which the three highest bills could be taken, and\nTriton failed to present these arguments to the trial court.

Analysis\n [37] In its motion for summary judgment, StarTex sought $75,589.36 in attorney's fees, and\nits attorney, Rodney Drinnon, submitted an affidavit in support of an award for attorney's fees.\nDrinnon averred that the contingency fee agreement awarding twenty-five percent of damages\nrecovered from any successful trial award constituted usual and customary attorney's fees; he\nprovided a list of specific tasks he and his law practice undertook during the course of representing\nStarTex; and he stated that his fee was supported by several, listed Arthur Andersen factors.\nDrinnon's description was “ ‘clear, positive, and direct, otherwise credible’ and [was] neither\ninternally inconsistent nor [contradictory]” and could have been readily controverted by Triton.\nSee id. at 514. Based on Drinnon's affidavit, submitted as evidence in support of the request for\nattorney's fees, StarTex was entitled to the statutory presumption that its attorney's usual and\ncustomary fees were reasonable. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 38.003; see also\nHaden, 332 S.W.3d at 514 (holding attorney's affidavit sufficient to warrant summary judgment\nwhen it (1) contained recitals establishing attorney's competency to swear to facts stated and\nother requirements of Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(f), (2) described work encompassed by the\nfees sought, and (3) specified factors that formed basis of his statement that amount claimed was\nreasonable and necessary, tracking seven of eight Arthur Andersen factors).\n\nTriton filed a written objection to Drinnon's affidavit, arguing that it failed to describe the time\nrequired to prosecute StarTex's claim, to provide counsel's hourly rate, and to discuss two of the\nArthur Andersen factors. We have already concluded that Drinnon's affidavit was sufficient *65\nto support StarTex's claim for attorney's fees. See Haden, 332 S.W.3d at 514. Triton did not file a\ncontroverting affidavit or any other evidence disputing Drinnon's evidence. Because Triton did not\npresent any controverting evidence, Triton cannot overcome the presumption of reasonableness\naccorded to Drinnon's affidavit in support of an award of attorney's fees. See id. at 514–16 (holding\nthat because nonmovant “did not controvert [attorney's] affidavit or otherwise dispute the law\nfirm's evidence, the law firm was ... entitled to the statutory presumption that the requested amount\nwas both reasonable and necessary”).\n\n [38] [39] Triton also argues that StarTex is not entitled to attorney's fees on the basis of its\naffirmative defense that StarTex made an excessive demand on Triton prior to filing suit.

It stated that Triton should pay the listed amounts within thirty days or make arrangements\nto satisfy the debt. Thus, the amounts demanded by StarTex prior to filing suit were not so much\ngreater than the amount it was eventually awarded as to be “excessive” or to indicate that the\ndemand was made in bad faith. Triton presented no evidence that StarTex would have refused\ntender of the $314,358.13 awarded by the trial court. Triton has failed to establish that this\nexception to StarTex's statutory right to attorney's fees is met.

Westar subsequently transferred\nits interest in the judgment to Creditor Liquidity Solutions, L.P. Appellant brings one issue,\nasserting the trial court erred in granting Westar's motion for summary judgment on the liquidated\ndamages provision of the contract because that provision was an unenforceable penalty. We affirm\nthe trial court's judgment.\n\nIn 2005, appellant and Westar entered into a five-year Master Services Agreement in which\nappellant promised to pay Westar $8800 each month and Westar promised to provide appellant\nsatellite uplink services for local television programming and distribution. Paragraph 7 of the\nagreement contained a liquidated damages provision:\n\n            7. Early Termination Liability. In the event that Customer [appellant] terminates\n            Service prior to the expiration of the Term specified on the appropriate Service\n            Agreement or other request for Service other than for cause, or in the event that\n            Company [Westar] terminates this Agreement as a result of Customer's failure\n            to abide by the terms and conditions herein, Customer shall pay a termination\n            charge equal to 100% of the monthly charges multiplied by the number of\n            months remaining on the Term of the Service Agreement or any additional\n            requests for Service, as applicable.\n\nIn 2007, appellant defaulted on its obligations under the agreement. Westar terminated the\nagreement and sued appellant for breach of contract seeking an award of damages under paragraph\n7. In response to Westar's motion for summary judgment, appellant admitted it defaulted on the\nagreement, but it asserted that paragraph 7 was an unenforceable penalty. The trial court granted\nWestar's motion for summary judgment and awarded Westar damages pursuant to paragraph 7. 1\n\nTo prevail on a summary judgment motion brought under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c),\na movant must show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law.

Tenants filed counterclaim, asserting a statutory claim for wrongful\nwithholding of security deposit and a premises liability claim based on sexual assault of female\ntenant. The 321st District Court, Smith County, John R. Adamson, J., entered summary judgment\nfor landlords on unpaid rent claim, and following jury trial, issued directed verdict in favor of\nlandlords on premises liability claim, and entered judgment on jury verdict for landlords on\nremaining claims. Tenants appealed, and landlords filed motion for sanctions.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, Terry McCall, J., held that:\n\n[1] landlords and tenants did not mutually assent to the release of the tenants' obligations under\nlease extension;\n\n[2] alleged errors in two jury questions were immaterial;\n\n[3] evidence was sufficient to support finding that landlords did not act in bad faith in connection\nwith failure to return deposit;\n\n[4] landlords were entitled to recover attorney's fees incurred in successfully defending tenants'\nsecurity deposit claims;\n\n[5] landlords could recover prejudgment interest on attorney's fees which they paid prior to entry\nof judgment;\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

William and Yuko Colthurst (the landlords)\nleased their home in Tyler to Tim and Stephanie (Scholler) Williams (the tenants) in a written lease\nsigned on March 6, 2000. The lease provided for a term of two years beginning on May 1, 2000,\nand ending April 30, 2002. The landlords' home was available for lease for an extended period\nof time because they were moving to Japan. The landlords designated a real estate firm, Century\n21 Advantage, to serve as the property manager for the house during the term of the lease. Tom\nDeWitt served as the individual that managed the property on behalf of Century 21 Advantage.\n\nIn the early part of 2002, the landlords and the tenants began discussing the disposition of the\nhome at the end of the lease. The tenants had expressed an interest in continuing to lease the home.\nThe landlords informed the tenants that they wanted to sell the home when the lease ended in\nApril. The tenants subsequently invoked an extension clause of the lease that permitted them to\nunilaterally extend the lease for an additional six months.\n\nThe tenants' desire to remain in the home for an additional six months changed when Mrs. Williams\nwas sexually assaulted in the home on April 16, 2002. Mr. Williams informed the landlords in\nan e-mail on April 20, 2002, that the tenants did not want to continue occupying the home. 1\nMr. Williams suggested to the landlords in this e-mail that, unless they listed the house for\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The landlords and the\ntenants subsequently exchanged several e-mails over the course of the next month discussing the\npossibility of the tenants vacating the home prior to the end of the six-month extension period.\nThe tenants ultimately vacated the home at the end of May 2002.\n\nThe landlords subsequently filed suit against the tenants on January 8, 2003, asserting claims\nfor unpaid rent and property damage. The tenants responded by filing a counterclaim against\nthe landlords asserting a statutory claim for wrongful withholding of their security deposit and a\npremises liability claim in connection with the sexual assault. With respect to the premises liability\nclaim, the tenants alleged that the landlords had failed to equip the home with proper security\ndevices required by statute. The tenants additionally asserted a premises liability claim against\nWGW Properties, Inc. d/b/a Century 21 Advantage, Tom DeWitt, and Century 21 Real Estate\nCorporation (collectively referred to as the property manager). The landlords joined the assailant\nwho sexually assaulted Mrs. Williams, Felix Kauffman, as a responsible third party with respect\nto the premises liability claim.\n\nThe trial court entered a partial summary judgment in favor of the landlords on the unpaid rent\nclaim. The remaining claims proceeded to trial. At the conclusion of the presentation of evidence,\nthe *358 trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of the landlords and the property manager\non the premises liability claim. Issues concerning the property damage and security deposit claims\nand attorney's fees were submitted to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the landlords on all\nsubmitted claims. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the landlords and property manager\nin accordance with the partial summary judgment, the directed verdict, and the jury's findings.\n\n\n\n                                                  Issues\n\nThe tenants raise seven issues on appeal. The first issue challenges the partial summary judgment\nentered in favor of the landlords on their unpaid rent claim. In their second and third issues, the\ntenants contend that the trial court erred in failing to enter judgment in their favor on their statutory\nsecurity deposit claim as a matter of law. The tenants' fourth issue globally attacks the trial court's\njudgment. The tenants challenge the directed verdict denying their premises liability claim in their\nfifth issue. The tenants' sixth and seventh issues relate to their attempt to set aside the award of\nthe landlords' attorney's fees. We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                               Unpaid Rent\n\n[1] The trial court entered a partial summary judgment in favor of the landlords in the amount\nof $8,850 on their unpaid rent claim.

The tenants submitted a portion of the e-mails as summary judgment evidence to\nsupport their contention. The landlords replied to the tenants' contention by submitting all of the e-\nmails between the parties to support their assertion that the parties did not reach a valid agreement\nto excuse the tenants from the six-month extension.\n\n *359 [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] A modification of a contract must satisfy the elements of a contract:\na meeting of the minds supported by consideration.

The parties discussed the possibility of the tenants vacating the premises at the end of May\n2002 and being released from the remainder of the six-month extension period. However, a dispute\nexisted with respect to the payment of rent for the month of May. The tenants took the position\nthat the security deposit that they made at the beginning of the lease term included the last month's\nrent. Based upon this contention, the tenants asserted that they had already paid May's rent since\nit constituted the last month that they would be occupying the home. The landlords disagreed with\nthis contention and demanded the payment of rent for May.\n\nThe landlords sent the last communication in the exchange of e-mails between the parties on May\n20, 2002. In this e-mail, the landlords advised the tenants as follows: “You are NOT released from\nyour extension until you recieve [sic] written notice of such.... You ARE in breach of your lease,\nand you ARE overdue on your rent for May 2002.” This e-mail conclusively establishes that the\nparties did not mutually agree for the tenants to be released from the six-month extension period.\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err in granting partial summary judgment on the landlords'\nclaim for unpaid rent. The tenants' first issue is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                               Waived Issues\n\n [7] [8] [9] The tenants second and third issues concern their statutory security deposit claim. See\nTEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 92.109 (Vernon 2007). They assert in their second issue that the trial\ncourt erred in denying their motion for partial summary judgment on their statutory security deposit\nclaim. We note, however, that the tenants' statutory security deposit claim was subsequently tried\nto the jury. The general rule is that a denial of a summary judgment cannot be reviewed on appeal.\nSee Cincinnati Life Ins. Co. v. Cates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1687202\"><a href=\"/opinion/1687202/cincinnati-life-ins-co-v-cates/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 625 (Tex.1996). Further, where a motion for\nsummary judgment is denied by the trial court and the case is tried on its merits, the order denying\nthe summary judgment cannot be reviewed on appeal. See *360 Ackermann v. Vordenbaum,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2456648\"><a href=\"/opinion/2456648/ackermann-v-vordenbaum/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 365 (Tex.1966). 3 Consequently, the trial court's denial of the tenants' motion\nfor partial summary judgment is not reviewable on appeal. The tenants' second issue is overruled.\n\n [10] In their third issue, the tenants assert that the trial court erred in denying their motion for\ndirected verdict. The tenants moved for a directed verdict after the landlords rested their case-in-\nchief on the landlords' property damage claim. After the trial court denied the motion for directed\nverdict, the tenants proceeded with presenting evidence during their case-in-chief and did not\nreurge their motion for directed verdict at the close of the evidence. Therefore, the tenants failed\nto preserve their complaint for appellate review. See 1986 Dodge 150 Pickup v.

We address these\ncomplaints separately.\n\n [11] The tenants first contend that the trial court should have disregarded the jury's “no” answers\nto Question Nos. 5 and 7 of the court's charge. Question No. 5 asked the jury if the landlords\n“wrongfully” withheld any portion of the security deposit. Question No. 7 asked the jury to\ndetermine if the landlords “wrongfully” failed to timely provide a written description and itemized\nlist of damages after the tenants surrendered possession of the premises.\n\nSection 92.109 establishes two causes of action that permit a tenant to seek a recovery of his\nsecurity deposit from his landlord. See Pulley v. Milberger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1655819\"><a href=\"/opinion/1655819/pulley-v-milberger/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427–28 (Tex.App.-\nDallas 2006, pet. denied). The first cause of action involves a landlord's bad faith retention of\nthe security deposit and is established in Section 92.109(a). To prevail under this cause of action,\nthe tenant must prove the landlord (1) acted in bad faith and (2) retained the security deposit in\nviolation of the statute. When a landlord is found liable under Section 92.109(a), the tenant may\nrecover from the landlord (1) an amount equal to the sum of $100, (2) three times the portion of\nthe security deposit wrongfully withheld, and (3) the tenant's reasonable attorney's fees in a suit\nto recover the security deposit.\n\nThe second cause of action involves a landlord's bad faith failure to account for the security deposit\nand is established in Section 92.109(b). To prevail under this cause of action, the tenant must\nprove the landlord (1) acted in bad faith and (2) failed to provide the tenant with: (a) a written\ndescription of the damages in violation of the statute and (b) an itemized list of the deductions\nin violation of the statute. A landlord who is found liable under Section 92.109(b): (1) forfeits\nthe right to withhold any portion of the security deposit, (2) forfeits the right to sue the tenant for\ndamages to the premises, and (3) is liable for the tenant's reasonable attorney's *361 fees in a suit\nto recover the security deposit.\n\nQuestion No. 5 contained most of the elements of a cause of action under Section 92.109(a), and\nQuestion No. 7 contained most of the elements of a cause of action under Section 92.109(b).\nParticularly, Question Nos. 5 and 7 omitted the element of bad faith.

This unchallenged finding 4 precludes our consideration of the tenants'\nevidentiary challenges to Question Nos. 5 and 7. Even if the jury had answered Question Nos.\n5 and 7 in favor of the tenants or if the trial court had disregarded the jury's “no” answers to\nthese questions, the jury's “no” answers to Question No. 8 prevents the tenants from making a\nrecovery on either of their statutory security deposit causes of action.

The jury awarded the landlords $1,858.63 in property\ndamages. The tenants assert that the landlords could not have been prevailing parties under the\nlease's attorney's fee provision because the tenants' security deposit of either $2,450 or $3,900\nexceeded the amount of property damages awarded by the jury. This contention is not consistent\nwith the manner that the parties' presented the property damage question to the jury during closing\narguments. Specifically, both parties argued that the jury's answer to the property damage question\nshould be the amount of damages that the jury determined were in excess of the security deposit\nmade by the tenants. Accordingly, the landlords were prevailing parties on their property damage\nclaim because the jury made an award for property damages in excess of the security deposit made\nby the tenants.\n\n [20] Finally, the tenants argue that they should have been credited with either a payment of $2,450\nor $3,900 toward the judgment's award of prejudgment interest. The tenants base this argument\non the same contention discussed in the preceding paragraph. This argument is misplaced because\nthe award of prejudgment interest is based on amounts ordered to be paid by the tenants in excess\nof their security deposit.

City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827.\n\nAs noted previously, Mrs. Williams was sexually assaulted inside the home on April 16, 2002. Her\nassailant, Felix Kauffman, testified at trial. Kauffman followed her home one day after observing\nher at a fitness club in Tyler. He returned to the home the next day and entered it when no\none was present. Kauffman testified that he entered the home through the unlocked front door.\nHe hid in the house while waiting for Mrs. Williams to return. After Mrs. Williams entered the\nhome, he tackled her inside of the master bedroom. *364 Kauffman immediately blindfolded\nMrs. Williams, and then he sexually assaulted her. The sexual assault ended when Mr. Williams\nreturned home. Kauffman fled the home when Mr. Williams discovered the assault taking place.\n\nThe bedroom where the assault occurred had an exterior door that opened into the backyard. The\ntenants' premises liability claim focuses on the type of lock on the interior side of this door. The\nlock required a key in order for the door to be locked or unlocked from the inside. The tenants\nkept the key to this lock at another location inside the bedroom. The tenants contend that this type\nof lock violated the requirements of TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 92.153 (Vernon 2007) because\nit was not a “keyless bolting device.”\n\nMrs. Williams did not attempt to escape from Kauffman during the attack. She testified that she\nconsidered trying to escape during the attack but that she knew there was no way she could have\nretrieved the key to the door and then used it to open the door. The tenants contend that the type of\nlock on the exterior bedroom door contributed to her decision to submit to the assault. They assert\nthat Mrs. Williams would have had a better chance of escaping from Kauffman if the exterior\nbedroom door had been equipped with a keyless bolting device as required by the statute.\n\n [22] [23] There is a significant body of law in Texas dealing with a landlord's liability for an\nattack on a tenant by a third party occurring on the leased premises. As a rule, a person has no\nlegal duty to protect another from the criminal acts of a third person. Timberwalk Apartments,\nPartners, Inc. v.

Id.\n\nIn the typical landlord liability case, the tenant asserts that the landlord's negligence caused him\nor her to be the victim of the criminal act of a third person.

Id. The general danger in the typical case is the risk of injury from the\ncriminal activity of third parties. Id. There must be evidence of specific previous crimes on or near\nthe premises in order to establish foreseeability. Id. In determining whether the criminal conduct\nwas foreseeable, the court must consider whether any criminal conduct previously occurred on or\nnear the property, how recently the criminal conduct occurred, how often it occurred, how similar\nthe conduct was to the conduct on the property, and what publicity was given to the occurrences\nto indicate whether the landlord knew or should have known about them. Id. at 757.\n\nThe fact pattern in this appeal differs significantly from the ordinary claim because the tenants\nare not asserting that the landlords and the property manager failed to prevent the assault from\never occurring. Instead, the tenants are contending that the acts and omissions of the landlords\nand the property manager hampered Mrs. Williams's opportunity to escape from the criminal acts\nof a third party. The tenants' claim is, therefore, more complex than the typical landlord liability\ncase because it requires us to consider an additional element to determine the landlords' potential\nliability. This additional element is the matter of evaluating *365 Mrs. Williams's opportunity\nto escape from her attacker.\n\n [24] [25] [26] To prevail on their premises liability claim, the tenants must establish the\nexistence of a duty, a breach of that duty, and damages proximately caused by the breach.

The possibility of escaping a physical assault brought about by a criminal\nperpetrator is an inherently speculative matter.

The jury awarded the landlords attorney's fees of $10,000 on the rent claim.\nThe landlords' trial counsel testified that they had incurred attorney's fees of $15,000 on the rent\nclaim. On cross-examination, the landlords' trial counsel attributed $5,000 of the $15,000 amount\nto work performed through the point of obtaining the partial summary judgment.\n\nNear the end of the trial, the tenants informed the trial court during a bench conference that they\nwanted to call one of the landlords' other attorneys as a witness.

The trial court also did\nnot permit the tenants to offer the associate's affidavit as an exhibit. 7\n\nThe tenants alleged in their motion for new trial that the testimony of the landlords' trial counsel\nconstituted intrinsic fraud on the basis that it was inconsistent with the matters set out in the\nassociate's affidavit. In response to the motion for new trial, the landlords filed a motion for\nsanctions against the tenants' trial counsel, J. Bennett White, asserting that he lacked a factual basis\nfor the intrinsic fraud allegation. The trial court denied the motion for new trial after conducting a\nhearing on the motion. The trial court also granted the landlords' motion for sanctions by ordering\nWhite to pay the landlords sanctions in the amount of $250.\n\nIn their sixth issue, the tenants assert that the trial court erred in denying the motion for new trial\non the basis of intrinsic fraud. We review a trial court's ruling on a motion for new trial for an\nabuse of discretion. Dir., State Employees Workers' Comp. Div. v.

We begin our analysis by noting that no reporter's record from the hearing on the\nmotion for new trial has been filed in this appeal. In the absence of a record from the hearing, we\nare unable to determine if the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for new trial.\n\nMoreover, the Tyler Court of Appeals has previously addressed the tenants' allegation of intrinsic\nfraud in a mandamus proceeding in In re Williams, No. 12–06–00361–CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1241517</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Tex.App.-Tyler April 30, 2007, orig. proceeding) (mem.op.).

In reaching its decision to deny\nthe tenants' mandamus request, the Tyler Court of Appeals noted that the tenants “presented no\nevidence of intrinsic fraud at the hearing on their motion for new trial.” Id. In the absence of\na record from the hearing, we are reluctant to disagree with the determination by the Tyler Court\nof Appeals that the tenants presented no evidence of intrinsic fraud. The trial court did not abuse\nits discretion in denying the motion for new trial if the tenants did not present any evidence of\nintrinsic fraud. The tenants' sixth issue is overruled.\n\nThe tenants allege in their seventh issue that the trial court erred in ordering White to pay sanctions.\nThe landlords sought sanctions against White under TEX.R. CIV. P. 13 on the basis that White\ndid not have a good faith basis to allege that the landlords' trial counsel offered false testimony\non the issue of attorney's fees. The landlords sought sanctions in the amount of $500, which they\nalleged constituted their attorney's fees for filing the motion for sanctions. After a hearing, the trial\ncourt granted the motion by ordering White to pay sanctions of $250. We review the imposition\nof Rule 13 sanctions under the abuse of discretion standard. See Low v. Henry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894843\"><a href=\"/opinion/894843/low-v-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n614 (Tex.2007).\n\n [27] As a preliminary matter, we note that the tenants filed a separate notice of appeal with respect\nto the sanctions order that was entered after the trial court signed the final judgment. However, this\nnotice of appeal does not list White as an appellant. The landlords contend that the tenants lack\nstanding to appeal the sanctions order because it only affects White. In Braden v. Downey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1682126\"><a href=\"/opinion/1682126/braden-v-downey/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 928 n. 6 (Tex.1991), the supreme court reserved this question for future consideration.\n(“We express no opinion on the question whether, in order to seek review of sanctions by appeal,\nan attorney must perfect a separate appeal apart from that perfected by his client.”) In the absence\nof an answer to the question in Braden, we agree with the landlords' contention that the tenants\nlack standing to attack the sanctions order. “Texas courts have long held that ... appealing [parties]\nmay not complain of errors that do not injuriously affect [them] or that merely affect the rights of\nothers.” Torrington Co. v. Stutzman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1543055\"><a href=\"/opinion/1543055/torrington-co-v-stutzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 843 (Tex.2000); Tex.

However, a record of the hearing has not been filed in this appeal. As was the case\nwith the motion for new trial, without a record of the hearing, we are unable to determine if the\ntrial court abused its discretion in granting sanctions. Additionally, the opinion by the Tyler Court\nof Appeals reveals that White lacked a good faith basis for making the intrinsic fraud allegation\nbecause he did not seek discovery of the landlords' attorney's fees statements during the applicable\ndiscovery period. The tenants' seventh issue is overruled.\n\n*368 [29] Finally, the landlords have filed a motion for further sanctions against White based\nupon the presentation of the tenants' sixth issue. This motion is overruled.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The landlords' motion for sanctions on appeal is\noverruled.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Mr. Williams did not inform the landlords in his April 20, 2002 e-mail that Mrs. Williams was sexually assaulted inside the home.\n       Instead, Mr. Williams based the tenants' desire to vacate the house on “the sudden death of [Mr. Williams's] father and also a painful\n       event for [Mrs. Williams].”\n2      The partial summary judgment did not address the landlords' recovery of attorney's fees on their unpaid rent claim.\n\n3      The party's remedy is to assign error to the trial court's judgment ultimately rendered following trial on the merits. See Turner v.\n       County of Marion, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1526658\"><a href=\"/opinion/1526658/turner-v-county-of-marion/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1977, writ dism'd).\n4      The tenants have not challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's determination that the landlords did not act\n       in bad faith.\n5      As noted previously, the parties disputed the amount of the security deposit made by the tenants. Based upon the positions taken by\n       the parties, the tenants posted a security deposit of either $3,900, $2,450, or $1,000.\n6      We note that the tenants have not cited any authority in support of their contentions regarding the judgment's award of costs.\n\n7      The arguments presented to the trial court indicated that the tenants did not list the associate as a witness and did not list the associate's\n       affidavit as an exhibit.\n8      The Texas Supreme Court transferred the instant appeal to this court from the Tyler Court of Appeals in a docket control order. The\n       transfer order did not extend to the tenants' subsequent mandamus proceeding.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.
