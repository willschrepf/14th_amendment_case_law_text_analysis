Two sophisticated investors\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit Judge.\r                                           \r\n\nbought computer-lease  tax shelters.   The 1986  revisions to\r\n\nthe Tax  Code undercut  the economic  rationale for  such tax\r\n\nshelters.    As  a  result,  the  seller  of  the   shelters,\r\n\nTechnology Finance  Group (\"TFG\"), later became insolvent and\r\n\nviolated  its  investment  contracts.     A  public  company,\r\n\nCreative Resources,  Inc. (\"CRI\"),  acquired control  of TFG,\r\n\npoured in money and attempted, unsuccessfully, to salvage the\r\n\ncompany.  The two  investors, plaintiffs here, sued TFG,  its\r\n\nnew parent and two individuals, officers of the parent, inter\r                                                                         \r\n\nalia,  for  TFG's breach  of  contract  on  a corporate  veil\r                \r\n\npiercing theory.   The investors  obtained a jury  verdict of\r\n\n$250,000.1  We  reverse and vacate  the verdict, finding  the\r\n\nevidence   insufficient   to   meet   the   strict  standards\r\n\nMassachusetts has set for piercing the corporate veil.\r\n\nFacts\r                 \r\n\n          In  1986,  plaintiffs  Charles  Birbara  and  David\r\n\nMassad  each purchased  a  one-half ownership  interest in  a\r\n\ncommercial  computer from  a  subsidiary of  TFG, a  Delaware\r\n\ncorporation that leased commercial equipment as tax shelters.\r\n\nIn addition, Massad purchased a  second computer from the TFG\r\n\naffiliate.   These computers  were subject to  existing \"user\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  With interest, this resulted  in an award of $427,945.21.\r\nThe court  and jury rejected fraud,  conversion and deceptive\r\ntrade practices claims  against the defendants.  TFG  has not\r\nappealed from the verdict against it.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nleases\"  with companies  that  had actual  possession of  the\r\n\ncomputers,  as well  as to the  right of a  TFG subsidiary to\r\n\nsell the computers when the leases expired.  TFG was required\r\n\nto pay  plaintiffs the proceeds of these  sales, less certain\r\n\nfees.  Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986,\r\n\nTFG  became  unable  to   market  its  equipment  leases  and\r\n\nconsequently could not  generate adequate operating  capital.\r\n\nIn an effort to return the company to firm financial footing,\r\n\nJerry Minsky,  TFG's then-president  and CEO,  who  is not  a\r\n\nparty  to this suit, decided that TFG would not pay investors\r\n\nthe proceeds  from the  sales of their  equipment but  rather\r\n\nwould retain  these funds,  thereby violating the  investment\r\n\ncontracts.\r\n\n          TFG continued to face financial problems.  In 1989,\r\n\nCRI, a  public Nevada  corporation which owned  several other\r\n\nbusinesses,  acquired  complete  ownership  of  TFF, Inc.,  a\r\n\nDelaware  corporation which  owned  all of  TFG's outstanding\r\n\ncommon  stock.   CRI began  taking steps to  ameliorate TFG's\r\n\nfinancial  problems.    Gordon Locke  and  Dennis Williamson,\r\n\nmembers of  the CRI  Board of Directors'  Executive Committee\r\n\nand  CRI's  only  preferred shareholders,  together  invested\r\n\n$250,000 in CRI.   CRI, in turn, made interest  bearing loans\r\n\nto TFG,  which were  properly documented  in the  accounts of\r\n\nboth companies.   Locke and Williamson  became executive vice\r\n\npresidents of  TFG, for  which Williamson received  an annual\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nsalary of  $206,250 and  a monthly automobile  allowance, and\r\n\nfor which Locke received  an annual salary of $187,500  and a\r\n\nmonthly  automobile allowance.    In addition,  TFG's by-laws\r\n\nwere amended to curtail the power of the CEO, Minsky.\r\n\n          CRI  was  careful  to  observe  all  the  corporate\r\n\nformalities  with respect  to  TFG.   The  two companies  had\r\n\ndifferent boards  of directors  and separate  board meetings.\r\n\nAlthough, consistent with  good accounting practice, CRI  and\r\n\nTFG  eventually had  consolidated financial  statements, each\r\n\nkept its own financial records.\r\n\n          The new  management  of  TFG  decided  to  continue\r\n\nMinsky's policy of violating  contracts with TFG investors by\r\n\nreselling  equipment  leases  without  paying  investors  the\r\n\nproceeds, believing that this was the only way to continue to\r\n\nimprove  TFG's financial health as well  as to avoid favoring\r\n\ninvestors whose equipment  had not been  sold before TFG  was\r\n\nacquired  by CRI.   CRI,  however, did  begin the  process of\r\n\noffering  to  all  of  the  investors  whose  contracts  were\r\n\nviolated a settlement package which included cash, notes, and\r\n\nCRI stock.\r\n\n          One  of  TFG's  numerous creditors  took  steps  to\r\n\nattach a TFG  bank account in  Connecticut.  TFG  transferred\r\n\nfunds out  of this account  into a TFG account  in a Canadian\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nbank in  order to meet  the payroll for TFG  employees.2  For\r\n\nseveral  months in 1990, Locke  ran TFG's payroll  out of his\r\n\npersonal  attorney  operating account  in  New  York and  was\r\n\nreimbursed  with funds  transferred out  of the  TFG Canadian\r\n\naccount.  Eventually,  in January  1991, CRI sold  TFG.   TFG\r\n\nowed  CRI over one million dollars; this debt was forgiven at\r\n\nthe time TFG was sold.\r\n\n          Neither of the plaintiffs in this case ever had any\r\n\ndirect  dealings  with  CRI,   Locke  or  Williamson.    Both\r\n\nplaintiffs had a number of other tax shelter investments, and\r\n\nrelied on David Levinson, their financial advisor, as to this\r\n\ninvestment.    Indeed, Massad  never  even  read the  initial\r\n\noffering memorandum.   Levinson  first became aware  of TFG's\r\n\nfinancial difficulties in February 1990, after calling TFG in\r\n\npreparation  for a  meeting  with Birbara.   On  February 20,\r\n\nLevinson spoke to Locke, who told  him that he was sure  that\r\n\nplaintiffs' computers had been sold.  Although  Locke was not\r\n\nfamiliar with plaintiffs' machines,  he indicated that all of\r\n\nthe  computers  had  been sold,  and  that  he  would try  to\r\n\ndetermine exactly what had happened to plaintiffs' machines.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  In  both of  his  depositions taken  before trial,  Locke\r\ntestified that  it was his  best recollection that  the funds\r\nwere transferred out of TFG's Connecticut  account into a CRI\r\naccount in Canada.   However, at trial he testified  that his\r\nrecollection  had been  incorrect  and bank  statements  were\r\nproduced to substantiate his trial testimony.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          Levinson conveyed this  information to  plaintiffs,\r\n\nand in the next few days spoke to Locke or Williamson several\r\n\ntimes in  an effort to find  out more.  Levinson  knew he was\r\n\nspeaking with Locke and Williamson in their capacities as TFG\r\n\nofficers  and was  not confused  about the  various corporate\r\n\nrelationships.   On  February 27,  1990, Williamson  informed\r\n\nLevinson that  the computer  owned by plaintiffs  jointly had\r\n\nbeen sold by prior  management in October 1989, and  the next\r\n\nday, Levinson was told  that Massad's computer had also  been\r\n\nsold in October 1989 by prior management.\r\n\n          CRI, however, had taken control of TFG prior to the\r\n\nsale  of the two computers,  and thus the  new management had\r\n\nbeen   involved in these sales.   Moreover, the  bill of sale\r\n\nfor Massad's  computer dates  from late February  1990, after\r\n\nLevinson's calls.  Defendants contend  that Massad's computer\r\n\nwas  actually  sold  in  November  1989  by  the  company  in\r\n\npossession  (which  later  reimbursed  TFG),  and  that   the\r\n\nFebruary bill  of sale was  simply an accounting  between TFG\r\n\nand  that other company.   Defendants assert that  this was a\r\n\ncommon industry practice.  The jury would have been warranted\r\n\nin disbelieving defendants' claim  that Massad's computer had\r\n\nbeen sold in November 1989.\r\n\n          Levinson's telephone calls prompted Locke  in early\r\n\nMarch  to send  each  of the  plaintiffs the  settlement form\r\n\nletter  on CRI  stationery  that he  was  in the  process  of\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nsending out to  all TFG  investors.  The  letter provided  in\r\n\nrelevant part:\r\n\n          Early last year this company acquired all\r\n          the  stock  of Technology  Finance Group,\r\n          Inc. (\"TFG\") from which you purchased [an\r\n          interest]  in  equipment as  indicated in\r\n          the attached  Schedule A.  At  the end of\r\n          June,  1989  management  changed.    This\r\n          Company, and  its subsidiary TFG,  is now\r\n          operated by new management.  We, the  new\r\n          management have reviewed TFG's  books and\r\n          records and concluded, to the best of our\r\n          knowledge, in relation  to the  equipment\r\n          owned   by   you,  that   TFG   owes  you\r\n          Additional Rent  .  . .  .   Regrettably,\r\n          over  the past 5  years, prior management\r\n          of TFG has not remitted sums to owners of\r\n          equipment   to   a   total    amount   of\r\n          approximately  $7  Million.   Further, we\r\n          concluded, upon review  of the  financial\r\n          statements of the Company  . . . that TFG\r\n          does not have the financial  resources to\r\n          repay these funds.\r\n\n          . . . .\r\n\n          Your  concern  and disappointment  at the\r\n          position in which you have been placed is\r\n          extremely understandable.  However, it is\r\n          most important that  you understand  that\r\n          the   management   responsible  for   the\r\n          decisions  not to  pay you  have resigned\r\n          and that  new management is  concerned to\r\n          provide  you  with  the maximum  economic\r\n          benefit possible under the circumstances.\r\n\n          The jury would have  been warranted in finding that\r\n\nthe statement that former  management was responsible for the\r\n\nsales  of  plaintiffs'  computers  was not  true.    However,\r\n\ndespite  the misrepresentation, plaintiffs  were not confused\r\n\nabout the  relationship between the  corporate entities,  nor\r\n\ndid  they take any action  in reliance on  the new management\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nlanguage  in  the letter.    Although the  majority  of TFG's\r\n\ninvestors   accepted   the   standard   settlement   package,\r\n\nplaintiffs declined to do so.\r\n\nProcedural History\r                              \r\n\n          Plaintiffs, who are Massachusetts  residents, filed\r\n\nthis diversity suit in the District of Massachusetts in 1990,\r\n\nalleging breach  of contract,  common law  fraud, conversion,\r\n\ninterference  with contractual obligations,  and violation of\r\n\nthe  Massachusetts deceptive  trade practices  statute, Mass.\r\n\nGen.  L. ch. 93A,    2.  Aware  of TFG's precarious financial\r\n\ncondition, the plaintiffs brought  suit not only against TFG,\r\n\nbut also against CRI, Locke, and Williamson.\r\n\n          At  the  close of  the  evidence,  the trial  judge\r\n\nentered  a directed  verdict  against the  plaintiffs on  the\r\n\nfraud claim concerning the computer they owned jointly.   The\r\n\ndefendants then  moved, pursuant to Rule  50(a), for judgment\r\n\nas a matter  of law on various  grounds, including a lack  of\r\n\npersonal jurisdiction.  The district court denied the motion,\r\n\nruling that the personal  jurisdiction issue had been waived,\r\n\nbut  even  if  it  had not,  that  the  jury  could  find the\r\n\ndefendants had  sufficient contacts with Massachusetts  for a\r\n\nproper exercise of personal jurisdiction.  The jury found for\r\n\nthe defendants  on the remaining fraud  and interference with\r\n\ncontractual relations  claims, but for the  plaintiffs on the\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nbreach of contract claim.  The  trial judge reserved decision\r\n\non the Massachusetts deceptive trade practices claim.\r\n\n          After  the  verdict,  defendants  again  moved  for\r\n\njudgment as a  matter of law,  pursuant to Rule  50(b).   The\r\n\ntrial court denied  the motion.  At  the same time,  it ruled\r\n\nthat  the  defendants  had  not  violated  the  Massachusetts\r\n\ndeceptive trade practices statute,  finding that the decision\r\n\nto  breach  the  contract  with the  plaintiffs  was  a valid\r\n\nbusiness judgment rather than  an attempt on the part  of the\r\n\ndefendants to line their pockets.\r\n\nPersonal Jurisdiction\r                                 \r\n\n          The defendants  question whether there  is personal\r\n\njurisdiction  over  them  under the  Massachusetts  long  arm\r\n\nstatute, Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 233A,   3, and  the United States\r\n\nConstitution.    The  district  court found  that  all  three\r\n\ndefendants   had  waived   their   objections   to   personal\r\n\njurisdiction  and that in any event, the jury could find that\r\n\nthe defendants had sufficient contacts with Massachusetts for\r\n\na  proper  exercise of  jurisdiction.   The  trial  judge was\r\n\nplainly   correct   that   CRI  waived   any   objection   to\r\n\njurisdiction:  at  the  final pre-trial  conference,  defense\r\n\ncounsel  conceded  there  was  no jurisdictional  issue  with\r\n\nrespect  to CRI.  Because  parties are, as  a general matter,\r\n\nbound by  the representations, concessions,  and stipulations\r\n\nof  their attorneys,  United States  v. Woburn  City Athletic\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nClub,  928 F.2d 1, 6 (1st  Cir. 1991), this express waiver is\r                \r\n\ndispositive on  the issue  of the trial  court's jurisdiction\r\n\nover CRI.\r\n\n          The  matters  of waiver  and  personal jurisdiction\r\n\nover the two  individual defendants are far  closer.

That  CRI acquired ownership of TFF, Inc. and thus of TFG\r\nin 1989  while plaintiffs entered in their contracts with TFG\r\nseveral  years earlier  in 1986  does not  defeat plaintiffs'\r\nclaim, because the actions leading to  the breach of contract\r\noccurred  in   1989  and  1990,   after  CRI  had   made  the\r\nacquisition.  Thus, this  case does not involve an  effort to\r\nhold  a  later  parent  responsible  for  the  pre-parenthood\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nof the stock  of TFF, Inc.,  which in turn  owned all of  the\r\n\ncommon stock of TFG (but not its preferred stock).  Thus, CRI\r\n\nwas the parent once removed.\r\n\n          To start,  CRI is a publicly traded,  not a closely\r\n\nheld  corporation.   Caselaw  and  precedent  elsewhere  draw\r\n\ndistinctions between  close and public corporations,  and the\r\n\ncases where courts have allowed creditors to reach the assets\r\n\nof   shareholders   have   almost   always   involved   close\r\n\ncorporations.

Massachusetts apparently\r\n\nhas  not yet  addressed the issue  of piercing  the corporate\r\n\nveil of a public corporation.  The key Massachusetts cases on\r\n\npiercing the corporate veil  have all involved close, family-\r\n\nowned  defendant  corporations.   In  this  silence, we  will\r\n\nassume, dubitante,  that Massachusetts would  apply the  same\r\n\nstandards in  deciding whether  to pierce the  corporate veil\r\n\nwhen the defendant is a public corporation as it has when the\r\n\ndefendant is a close corporation.\r\n\n          Further,  this case  concerns injured  creditors of\r\n\nthe subsidiary seeking to  impose contract obligations on the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nactivities of its new corporate child.

For  several\r\n\nmonths,  defendant Locke  ran TFG's  payroll out  of  his own\r\n\nattorney operating account in New York because steps had been\r\n\ntaken  to  attach  TFG's  Connecticut  account.    Locke  was\r\n\nreimbursed  with funds  transferred out  of the  TFG Canadian\r\n\naccount.   It is undisputed that the funds disbursed by Locke\r\n\nand repaid by  TFG went  only to TFG  employees.   Plaintiffs\r\n\nwere unaware of the  transfers at the time and  the transfers\r\n\ndid  not affect  them.   This is  not the  sort of  \"confused\r\n\nintermingling\"  we think  the Supreme  Judicial Court  had in\r\n\nmind.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs also argue  that confused  intermingling\r\n\nwas  evident from cash infusions  into TFG by  CRI, Locke and\r\n\nWilliamson.  However, all  the money transferred from  CRI to\r\n\nTFG was in the form  of loans that were properly recorded  in\r\n\nthe financial records of  both corporations.  Moreover, there\r\n\nwas insufficient competent evidence  of transfers of money in\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nthe other direction, that is, from TFG to CRI.5   These loans\r\n\ndo not support the claim of confused intermingling.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs'   argument   that  there   was  serious\r\n\nconfusion about  the manner  and  capacity in  which the  two\r\n\ncorporations and  their  representatives acted  is  similarly\r\n\nunpersuasive.   There  is  no  evidence that  there  was  any\r\n\nconfusion  about on whose behalf a director was acting in any\r\n\ngiven instance.  Locke and Williamson, in their capacities as\r\n\ndirectors of both CRI and TFG, did sometimes act on behalf of\r\n\nboth corporations simultaneously, but  that is to be expected\r\n\nwhen individuals serve as directors for both a parent and its\r\n\nsubsidiary.  It is also to be expected that when a subsidiary\r\n\ncompany profits, the parent  company will as well.   That the\r\n\nfortunes of CRI and TFG were  to some extent linked does not,\r\n\nas  plaintiffs suggest,  militate  in favor  of piercing  the\r\n\ncorporate veil.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs admitted they were not misled about  the\r\n\nrelationship  between TFG  and CRI.   Indeed, Massad  did not\r\n\neven know that he had invested in TFG, let alone that CRI had\r\n\nbecome its parent.   Plaintiffs neither knew nor  cared about\r\n\nthe relationship  between CRI and  TFG, but rather  relied on\r\n\ntheir  financial  advisor,   Levinson,  who  understood   the\r\n\ncorporate relationship.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  The bank statements, the best evidence, show no transfers\r\nfrom TFG to CRI.\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n          As to the  first prong  of the My  Bread test,  the\r                                                              \r\n\nevidence  is only  that Locke  and  Williamson served  on the\r\n\nboards of both TFG and CRI.   Mere overlapping of boards does\r\n\nnot  meet the test of \"active and direct participation by the\r\n\nrepresentatives  of  one  corporation, apparently  exercising\r\n\nsome form of  pervasive control.\"   My Bread,  233 N.E.2d  at\r                                                        \r\n\n752.     Moreover,  plaintiffs   have  failed  to   show  any\r\n\n\"fraudulent  or injurious  consequence of  the intercorporate\r\n\nrelationship.\"   Plaintiffs argue  that the settlement offers\r\n\nwere misleading and fraudulent, because defendants attributed\r\n\nthe  decision to  retain  investment returns  to TFG's  prior\r\n\nmanagement,  when  it  had  been  the  decision  of  the  new\r\n\nmanagement  to continue  the policy  of violating  investment\r\n\ncontracts.\r\n\n          Even  assuming  this  misrepresentation might  have\r\n\nsupported  fraud  or  unfair  practices  claims  against  the\r\n\ndefendants  (claims the  jury  and court  here rejected),  we\r\n\nthink plaintiffs' argument misses  the point of the corporate\r\n\ndisregard  doctrine.    The phrase  \"fraudulent  or injurious\r\n\nconsequence\" is limited  in My  Bread by the  phrase \"of  the\r                                                 \r\n\nintercorporate relationship.\"  There  was no failure to \"make\r\n\nclear which  corporation [was] taking action\"  or \"to observe\r\n\nwith care\" the corporate form.

The 1986 revisions to the Tax Code undercut the economic rationale for such tax shelters.  As a result, the seller of the shelters, Technology Finance Group (\"TFG\"), later became insolvent and violated its investment contracts.  A public company, Creative Resources, Inc.  (\"CRI\"), acquired control of TFG, poured in money and attempted, unsuccessfully, to salvage the company.  The two investors, plaintiffs here, sued TFG, its new parent and two individuals, officers of the parent, inter alia, for TFG's breach of contract on a corporate veil piercing theory.  The investors obtained a jury verdict of $250,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We reverse and vacate the verdict, finding the evidence insufficient to meet the strict standards Massachusetts has set for piercing the corporate veil.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, plaintiffs Charles Birbara and David Massad each purchased a one-half ownership interest in a commercial computer from a subsidiary of TFG, a Delaware corporation that leased commercial equipment as tax shelters.  In addition, Massad purchased a second computer from the TFG affiliate.  These computers were subject to existing \"user leases\" with companies that had actual possession of the computers, as well as to the right of a TFG subsidiary to sell the computers when the leases expired.  TFG was required to pay plaintiffs the proceeds of these sales, less certain fees.  Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, TFG became unable to market its equipment leases and consequently could not generate adequate operating capital.  In an effort to return the company to firm financial footing, Jerry Minsky, TFG's then-president and CEO, who is not a party to this suit, decided that TFG would not pay investors the proceeds from the sales of their equipment but rather would retain these funds, thereby violating the investment contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TFG continued to face financial problems.  In 1989, CRI, a public Nevada corporation which owned several other businesses, acquired complete ownership of TFF, Inc., a Delaware corporation which owned all of TFG's outstanding common stock.  CRI began taking steps to ameliorate TFG's financial problems.  Gordon Locke and Dennis Williamson, members of the CRI Board of Directors' Executive Committee and CRI's only preferred shareholders, together invested $250,000 in CRI.  CRI, in turn, made interest bearing loans to TFG, which were properly documented in the accounts of both companies.  Locke and Williamson became executive vice presidents of TFG, for which Williamson received an annual salary of $206,250 and a monthly automobile allowance, and for which Locke received an annual salary of $187,500 and a monthly automobile allowance.  In addition, TFG's by-laws were amended to curtail the power of the CEO, Minsky.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CRI was careful to observe all the corporate formalities with respect to TFG.  The two companies had different boards of directors and separate board meetings.  Although, consistent with good accounting practice, CRI and TFG eventually had consolidated financial statements, each kept its own financial records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new management of TFG decided to continue Minsky's policy of violating contracts with TFG investors by reselling equipment leases without paying investors the proceeds, believing that this was the only way to continue to improve TFG's financial health as well as to avoid favoring investors whose equipment had not been sold before TFG was acquired by CRI.  CRI, however, did begin the process of offering to all of the investors whose contracts were violated a settlement package which included cash, notes, and CRI stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of TFG's numerous creditors took steps to attach a TFG bank account in Connecticut.  TFG transferred funds out of this account into a TFG account in a Canadian bank in order to meet the payroll for TFG employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  For several months in 1990, Locke ran TFG's payroll out of his personal attorney operating account in New York and was reimbursed with funds transferred out of the TFG Canadian account.  Eventually, in January 1991, CRI sold TFG.  TFG owed CRI over one million dollars;  this debt was forgiven at the time TFG was sold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of the plaintiffs in this case ever had any direct dealings with CRI, Locke or Williamson.  Both plaintiffs had a number of other tax shelter investments, and relied on David Levinson, their financial advisor, as to this investment.  Indeed, Massad never even read the initial offering memorandum.  Levinson first became aware of TFG's financial difficulties in February 1990, after calling TFG in preparation for a meeting with Birbara.  On February 20, Levinson spoke to Locke, who told him that he was sure that plaintiffs' computers had been sold.  Although Locke was not familiar with plaintiffs' machines, he indicated that all of the computers had been sold, and that he would try to determine exactly what had happened to plaintiffs' machines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Levinson conveyed this information to plaintiffs, and in the next few days spoke to Locke or Williamson several times in an effort to find out more.  Levinson knew he was speaking with Locke and Williamson in their capacities as TFG officers and was not confused about the various corporate relationships.  On February 27, 1990, Williamson informed Levinson that the computer owned by plaintiffs jointly had been sold by prior management in October 1989, and the next day, Levinson was told that Massad's computer had also been sold in October 1989 by prior management.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CRI, however, had taken control of TFG prior to the sale of the two computers, and thus the new management had been involved in these sales.  Moreover, the bill of sale for Massad's computer dates from late February 1990, after Levinson's calls.  Defendants contend that Massad's computer was actually sold in November 1989 by the company in possession (which later reimbursed TFG), and that the February bill of sale was simply an accounting between TFG and that other company.  Defendants assert that this was a common industry practice.  The jury would have been warranted in disbelieving defendants' claim that Massad's computer had been sold in November 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Levinson's telephone calls prompted Locke in early March to send each of the plaintiffs the settlement form letter on CRI stationery that he was in the process of sending out to all TFG investors.  The letter provided in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Early last year this company acquired all the stock of Technology Finance Group, Inc.  (\"TFG\") from which you purchased [an interest] in equipment as indicated in the attached Schedule A.  At the end of June, 1989 management changed.  This Company, and its subsidiary TFG, is now operated by new management.  We, the new management have reviewed TFG's books and records and concluded, to the best of our knowledge, in relation to the equipment owned by you, that TFG owes you Additional Rent....  Regrettably, over the past 5 years, prior management of TFG has not remitted sums to owners of equipment to a total amount of approximately $7 Million.  Further, we concluded, upon review of the financial statements of the Company ... that TFG does not have the financial resources to repay these funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Your concern and disappointment at the position in which you have been placed is extremely understandable.  However, it is most important that you understand that the management responsible for the decisions not to pay you have resigned and that new management is concerned to provide you with the maximum economic benefit possible under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury would have been warranted in finding that the statement that former management was responsible for the sales of plaintiffs' computers was not true.  However, despite the misrepresentation, plaintiffs were not confused about the relationship between the corporate entities, nor did they take any action in reliance on the new management language in the letter.  Although the majority of TFG's investors accepted the standard settlement package, plaintiffs declined to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs, who are Massachusetts residents, filed this diversity suit in the District of Massachusetts in 1990, alleging breach of contract, common law fraud, conversion, interference with contractual obligations, and violation of the Massachusetts deceptive trade practices statute, Mass.Gen.L. ch.  93A, &#167; 2.  Aware of TFG's precarious financial condition, the plaintiffs brought suit not only against TFG, but also against CRI, Locke, and Williamson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the evidence, the trial judge entered a directed verdict against the plaintiffs on the fraud claim concerning the computer they owned jointly.  The defendants then moved, pursuant to Rule 50(a), for judgment as a matter of law on various grounds, including a lack of personal jurisdiction.  The district court denied the motion, ruling that the personal jurisdiction issue had been waived, but even if it had not, that the jury could find the defendants had sufficient contacts with Massachusetts for a proper exercise of personal jurisdiction.  The jury found for the defendants on the remaining fraud and interference with contractual relations claims, but for the plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim.  The trial judge reserved decision on the Massachusetts deceptive trade practices claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the verdict, defendants again moved for judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Rule 50(b).  The trial court denied the motion.  At the same time, it ruled that the defendants had not violated the Massachusetts deceptive trade practices statute, finding that the decision to breach the contract with the plaintiffs was a valid business judgment rather than an attempt on the part of the defendants to line their pockets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants question whether there is personal jurisdiction over them under the Massachusetts long arm statute, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 223A, &#167; 3, and the United States Constitution.  The district court found that all three defendants had waived their objections to personal jurisdiction and that in any event, the jury could find that the defendants had sufficient contacts with Massachusetts for a proper exercise of jurisdiction.  The trial judge was plainly correct that CRI waived any objection to jurisdiction:  at the final pre-trial conference, defense counsel conceded there was no jurisdictional issue with respect to CRI.  Because parties are, as a general matter, bound by the representations, concessions, and stipulations of their attorneys, United States v. Woburn City Athletic Club, 928 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1991), this express waiver is dispositive on the issue of the trial court's jurisdiction over CRI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The matters of waiver and personal jurisdiction over the two individual defendants are far closer.  Because we find that plaintiffs did not submit evidence sufficient to sustain their verdict on the merits, we pretermit resolution of the jurisdictional issue.  See Norton v. Mathews, 427 U.S. 524, 530-31, 96 S.Ct. 2771, 2774-75, 49 L.Ed.2d 672 (1976) (where merits can be easily resolved in favor of the party challenging jurisdiction, resolution of complex and theoretical jurisdictional issue may be avoided);  Menorah Ins. Co., Ltd. v. INX Reinsurance Corp., 72 F.3d 218, 223 n. 9 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Piercing the Veil</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TFG admittedly violated its contract with plaintiffs, has not appealed and is liable to plaintiffs.  TFG is insolvent and plaintiffs, as TFG's putative creditors, seek to have CRI, the corporate parent, and Locke and Williamson, individuals who were officers of both TFG and CRI, satisfy TFG's contractual obligations.  Although corporate and individual defendants present slightly different questions, Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Co. v. Checkers, Inc., 754 F.2d 10, 15-16 (1st Cir.1985), the analyses are sufficiently similar to warrant discussing them together,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> only distinguishing the two categories when necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither party disputes that Massachusetts law controls in this diversity action.  Our review is de novo.  We will only reverse if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, would allow a reasonable factfinder to come to only one conclusion--that the moving party was entitled to a judgment in its favor.  Conway v. Electro Switch Corp., 825 F.2d 593, 598 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs seek to make the corporate parent and two of its officers liable for the damages owed for breach of contract by a subsidiary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Specifically, CRI acquired 100% of the stock of TFF, Inc., which in turn owned all of the common stock of TFG (but not its preferred stock).  Thus, CRI was the parent once removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To start, CRI is a publicly traded, not a closely held corporation.  Caselaw and precedent elsewhere draw distinctions between close and public corporations, and the cases where courts have allowed creditors to reach the assets of shareholders have almost always involved close corporations.  Easterbrook &amp; Fischel, The Economic Structure of Corporate Law 55-56 &amp; n. 8 (1991) (explaining that a \"manager's incentive to undertake overly risky projects is greater in close corporations\").  Massachusetts apparently has not yet addressed the issue of piercing the corporate veil of a public corporation.  The key Massachusetts cases on piercing the corporate veil have all involved close, family-owned defendant corporations.  In this silence, we will assume, dubitante, that Massachusetts would apply the same standards in deciding whether to pierce the corporate veil when the defendant is a public corporation as it has when the defendant is a close corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, this case concerns injured creditors of the subsidiary seeking to impose contract obligations on the parent and its officers.  Several courts and commentators have suggested that it should be more difficult to pierce the veil in a contract case than in a tort case.  See, e.g., Edwards Co. Inc. v. Monogram Indus., 730 F.2d 977, 980-84 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc);  Blumberg, The Law of Corporate Groups:  Substantive Law &#167;&#167; 17.01, 17.06, at 349-51, 359-60 (1987) (\"[T]he underlying facts and policies in contract are often very different from those in tort....\");  Easterbrook &amp; Fischel, supra, at 58 (\"Courts are more willing to disregard the corporate veil in tort than in contract cases.\");   Douglas &amp; Shanks, Insulation from Liability Through Subsidiary Corporations, 39 Yale L.J. 193, 210-11 (1929).  We have found no Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court case applying the veil piercing doctrine in a contract case.  The Appeals Court cases that do so have not addressed the question of whether it is more difficult to pierce the corporate veil in contract than in tort.  E.g., Evans v. Multicon Const. Corp., 30 Mass.App.Ct. 728, 574 N.E.2d 395, 400 (1991), review denied, 410 Mass. 1104, 577 N.E.2d 309 (1991) (tbl.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not, however, resolve this issue, because we find that plaintiffs do not even meet the standard articulated by the Supreme Judicial Court in its seminal ruling on veil piercing in a tort case, My Bread Baking Co. v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 353 Mass. 614, 233 N.E.2d 748 (1968).  As a preliminary matter, we note that \"Massachusetts has been somewhat more 'strict' than other jurisdictions in respecting the separate entities of different corporations.\"  My Bread, 233 N.E.2d at 752.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that My Bread teaches that the principle that corporations are generally to be regarded as distinct entities is not \"of unlimited application\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>Although common ownership of the stock of two or more corporations together with common management, standing alone, will not give rise to liability on the part of one corporation for the acts of another corporation or its employees, additional facts may be such as to permit the conclusion that an agency or similar relationship exists between the entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 751-52.   The Supreme Judicial Court explained that it is appropriate to depart from the general principle of corporate separateness:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>(a) when there is active and direct participation by the representatives of one corporation, apparently exercising some form of pervasive control, in the activities of another and there is some fraudulent or injurious consequence of the intercorporate relationship, or (b) when there is a confused intermingling of activity of two or more corporations engaged in a common enterprise with substantial disregard of the separate nature of the corporate entities, or serious ambiguity about the manner and capacity in which the various corporations and their respective representatives are acting.  In such circumstances, in imposing liability upon one or more of a group of \"closely identified\" corporations a court \"need not consider with nicety which of them\" ought to be held liable for the act of one corporation \"for which the plaintiff deserves payment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 752 (citation omitted).  However, in setting these circumstances in context, the Supreme Judicial Court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>Where there is common control of a group of separate corporations engaged in a single enterprise, failure (a) to make clear which corporation is taking action in a particular situation and the nature and extent of that action, or (b) to observe with care the formal barriers between the corporations with a proper segregation of their separate businesses records, and finances, may warrant some disregard of the separate entities in rare particular situations in order to prevent gross inequity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since My Bread, in a variety of factual settings (albeit none exactly analogous to this case), the Supreme Judicial Court has repeated that under Massachusetts law, the corporate veil will only be pierced in rare situations.   Spaneas v. Travelers Indem. Co., 423 Mass. 352, 668 N.E.2d 325, 326 (1996) (corporate veil will only be pierced to prevent gross inequity);  Berger v. H.P.

Co., 360 Mass. 188, 275 N.E.2d 33, 91 (1971) (courts will only look through the corporate veil to \"accomplish ... essential justice\"), cert. denied, 407 U.S. 910, 92 S.Ct. 2433, 2435, 2448, 32 L.Ed.2d 689 (1972) and 407 U.S. 914, 92 S.Ct. 2433, 2434, 32 L.Ed.2d 689 (1972);  Gordon Chem.  Co. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 358 Mass. 632, 266 N.E.2d 653, 657 (1971);  see also United Elec. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1091 (1st Cir.1992) (\"Under Massachusetts common law, disregarding the corporate form is permissible only in rare situations.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the evidence in light of the two prong My Bread test, starting with the second prong.  Plaintiffs clearly did not meet their burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence a \"confused intermingling\" of CRI's and TFG's activities with \"substantial disregard of the separate nature of the corporate entities,\" or \"serious ambiguity about the manner and capacity in which the [two] corporations and their respective representatives [were] acting.\"  My Bread, 233 N.E.2d at 752.   Defendants were extremely careful about maintaining the formal distinctions between CRI and TFG.  The two companies had distinct boards of directors, had separate board meetings, and each kept individual financial records.  There is no evidence showing that TFG was a sham or merely a shield behind which CRI could hide to escape liability for its own obligations.  Beneficial Fin.  Co., 275 N.E.2d at 91-92;  Gordon Chem.  Co., 266 N.E.2d at 657.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary evidence on which plaintiffs rely is TFG's movement of funds from a bank account in its own name in Connecticut into another TFG account in a Canadian bank in order to meet the payroll for TFG employees.  For several months, defendant Locke ran TFG's payroll out of his own attorney operating account in New York because steps had been taken to attach TFG's Connecticut account.  Locke was reimbursed with funds transferred out of the TFG Canadian account.  It is undisputed that the funds disbursed by Locke and repaid by TFG went only to TFG employees.  Plaintiffs were unaware of the transfers at the time and the transfers did not affect them.  This is not the sort of \"confused intermingling\" we think the Supreme Judicial Court had in mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that confused intermingling was evident from cash infusions into TFG by CRI, Locke and Williamson.  However, all the money transferred from CRI to TFG was in the form of loans that were properly recorded in the financial records of both corporations.  Moreover, there was insufficient competent evidence of transfers of money in the other direction, that is, from TFG to CRI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  These loans do not support the claim of confused intermingling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' argument that there was serious confusion about the manner and capacity in which the two corporations and their representatives acted is similarly unpersuasive.  There is no evidence that there was any confusion about on whose behalf a director was acting in any given instance.  Locke and Williamson, in their capacities as directors of both CRI and TFG, did sometimes act on behalf of both corporations simultaneously, but that is to be expected when individuals serve as directors for both a parent and its subsidiary.  It is also to be expected that when a subsidiary company profits, the parent company will as well.  That the fortunes of CRI and TFG were to some extent linked does not, as plaintiffs suggest, militate in favor of piercing the corporate veil.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs admitted they were not misled about the relationship between TFG and CRI.  Indeed, Massad did not even know that he had invested in TFG, let alone that CRI had become its parent.  Plaintiffs neither knew nor cared about the relationship between CRI and TFG, but rather relied on their financial advisor, Levinson, who understood the corporate relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first prong of the My Bread test, the evidence is only that Locke and Williamson served on the boards of both TFG and CRI.  Mere overlapping of boards does not meet the test of \"active and direct participation by the representatives of one corporation, apparently exercising some form of pervasive control.\"  My Bread, 233 N.E.2d at 752.   Moreover, plaintiffs have failed to show any \"fraudulent or injurious consequence of the intercorporate relationship.\"   Plaintiffs argue that the settlement offers were misleading and fraudulent, because defendants attributed the decision to retain investment returns to TFG's prior management, when it had been the decision of the new management to continue the policy of violating investment contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming this misrepresentation might have supported fraud or unfair practices claims against the defendants (claims the jury and court here rejected), we think plaintiffs' argument misses the point of the corporate disregard doctrine.  The phrase \"fraudulent or injurious consequence\" is limited in My Bread by the phrase \"of the intercorporate relationship.\"   There was no failure to \"make clear which corporation [was] taking action\" or \"to observe with care\" the corporate form.  My Bread, 233 N.E.2d at 752.   The Massachusetts Appeals Court has put this point well:  \"There is present in the cases which have looked through the corporate form an element of dubious manipulation and contrivance, finagling, such that corporate identities are confused and third parties cannot be quite certain with what they are dealing.\"  Evans, 574 N.E.2d at 400;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  cf. Oman Int'l Fin.  Ltd. v. Hoiyong Gems Corp., 616 F.Supp. 351, 364 (D.R.I.1985) (noting that the better reasoned cases under Rhode Island law only pierce the corporate veil when the injurious consequences are a direct result of the misuse of the corporate form).  Plaintiffs were never misled about which corporate entity--CRI or TFG--was obligated to them or was dealing with them.  Cf. Leatherbee Mortgage Co. v.

Pepsi-Cola, 754 F.2d at 15.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The majority of the Pepsi-Cola factors cut against piercing the corporate veil in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs largely based their case against the individual defendants on a theory that the two defendants ran TFG for their personal benefit--that by drawing salaries and receiving certain benefits, the defendants were siphoning off corporate funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  But that theory is topsy-turvy:  managers should not be put to the Hobson's choice of either working for free or facing personal liability.  Such a rule would undercut, not advance, the policy reasons for the corporate disregard doctrine.

TFG was not initially insufficiently capitalized for the purposes of its corporate endeavor and only became insolvent after a change in the tax laws.  See Laborers Clean-Up Contract Admin. Trust Fund v. Uriarte Clean-Up Serv., Inc., 736 F.2d 516, 525 (9th Cir.1984) (distinguishing, in dicta, the propriety of veil piercing when a subsidiary was undercapitalized at the outset from veil piercing when a subsidiary began with sufficient funds but subsequently fell upon hard times).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic contract was entered into between plaintiffs and TFG, and TFG became insolvent before CRI assumed ownership.  CRI bought TFG knowing that it was insolvent and pumped a great deal of money into TFG to try to make it profitable again.  That TFG may have continued to be undercapitalized in these circumstances does not argue for piercing the corporate veil.  Indeed, the contrary may well be true.  This is not a case involving a close corporation where the parent may \"form a subsidiary with minimal capitalization for the purpose of engaging in risky activities\" and where absolute limited liability would create \"incentives to engage in a socially excessive amount of risky activities.\"   Easterbrook &amp; Fischel, supra, at 57.   Nor is this a case of \"financial misconduct of the subsidiary involving such manipulation as asset-stripping or asset-siphoning, which depletes the resources of the subsidiary.\"   Blumberg, supra, &#167; 17.01, at 350.

Thus, this case does not involve an effort to hold a later parent responsible for the pre-parenthood activities of its new corporate child.  See, e.g., C.M. Corp. v. Oberer Dev.

The 1986 revisions to the Tax Code undercut the economic rationale for such tax shelters.  As a result, the seller of the shelters, Technology Finance Group (\"TFG\"), later became insolvent and violated its investment contracts.  A public company, Creative Resources, Inc.  (\"CRI\"), acquired control of TFG, poured in money and attempted, unsuccessfully, to salvage the company.  The two investors, plaintiffs here, sued TFG, its new parent and two individuals, officers of the parent, inter alia, for TFG's breach of contract on a corporate veil piercing theory.  The investors obtained a jury verdict of $250,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We reverse and vacate the verdict, finding the evidence insufficient to meet the strict standards Massachusetts has set for piercing the corporate veil.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, plaintiffs Charles Birbara and David Massad each purchased a one-half ownership interest in a commercial computer from a subsidiary of TFG, a Delaware corporation that leased commercial equipment as tax shelters.  In addition, Massad purchased a second computer from the TFG affiliate.  These computers were subject to existing \"user leases\" with companies that had actual possession of the computers, as well as to the right of a TFG subsidiary to sell the computers when the leases expired.  TFG was required to pay plaintiffs the proceeds of these sales, less certain fees.  Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, TFG became unable to market its equipment leases and consequently could not generate adequate operating capital.  In an effort to return the company to firm financial footing, Jerry Minsky, TFG's then-president and CEO, who is not a party to this suit, decided that TFG would not pay investors the proceeds from the sales of their equipment but rather would retain these funds, thereby violating the investment contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TFG continued to face financial problems.  In 1989, CRI, a public Nevada corporation which owned several other businesses, acquired complete ownership of TFF, Inc., a Delaware corporation which owned all of TFG's outstanding common stock.  CRI began taking steps to ameliorate TFG's financial problems.  Gordon Locke and Dennis Williamson, members of the CRI Board of Directors' Executive Committee and CRI's only preferred shareholders, together invested $250,000 in CRI.  CRI, in turn, made interest bearing loans to TFG, which were properly documented in the accounts of both companies.  Locke and Williamson became executive vice presidents of TFG, for which Williamson received an annual salary of $206,250 and a monthly automobile allowance, and for which Locke received an annual salary of $187,500 and a monthly automobile allowance.  In addition, TFG's by-laws were amended to curtail the power of the CEO, Minsky.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CRI was careful to observe all the corporate formalities with respect to TFG.  The two companies had different boards of directors and separate board meetings.  Although, consistent with good accounting practice, CRI and TFG eventually had consolidated financial statements, each kept its own financial records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new management of TFG decided to continue Minsky's policy of violating contracts with TFG investors by reselling equipment leases without paying investors the proceeds, believing that this was the only way to continue to improve TFG's financial health as well as to avoid favoring investors whose equipment had not been sold before TFG was acquired by CRI.  CRI, however, did begin the process of offering to all of the investors whose contracts were violated a settlement package which included cash, notes, and CRI stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of TFG's numerous creditors took steps to attach a TFG bank account in Connecticut.  TFG transferred funds out of this account into a TFG account in a Canadian bank in order to meet the payroll for TFG employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  For several months in 1990, Locke ran TFG's payroll out of his personal attorney operating account in New York and was reimbursed with funds transferred out of the TFG Canadian account.  Eventually, in January 1991, CRI sold TFG.  TFG owed CRI over one million dollars;  this debt was forgiven at the time TFG was sold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of the plaintiffs in this case ever had any direct dealings with CRI, Locke or Williamson.  Both plaintiffs had a number of other tax shelter investments, and relied on David Levinson, their financial advisor, as to this investment.  Indeed, Massad never even read the initial offering memorandum.  Levinson first became aware of TFG's financial difficulties in February 1990, after calling TFG in preparation for a meeting with Birbara.  On February 20, Levinson spoke to Locke, who told him that he was sure that plaintiffs' computers had been sold.  Although Locke was not familiar with plaintiffs' machines, he indicated that all of the computers had been sold, and that he would try to determine exactly what had happened to plaintiffs' machines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Levinson conveyed this information to plaintiffs, and in the next few days spoke to Locke or Williamson several times in an effort to find out more.  Levinson knew he was speaking with Locke and Williamson in their capacities as TFG officers and was not confused about the various corporate relationships.  On February 27, 1990, Williamson informed Levinson that the computer owned by plaintiffs jointly had been sold by prior management in October 1989, and the next day, Levinson was told that Massad's computer had also been sold in October 1989 by prior management.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CRI, however, had taken control of TFG prior to the sale of the two computers, and thus the new management had been involved in these sales.  Moreover, the bill of sale for Massad's computer dates from late February 1990, after Levinson's calls.  Defendants contend that Massad's computer was actually sold in November 1989 by the company in possession (which later reimbursed TFG), and that the February bill of sale was simply an accounting between TFG and that other company.  Defendants assert that this was a common industry practice.  The jury would have been warranted in disbelieving defendants' claim that Massad's computer had been sold in November 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Levinson's telephone calls prompted Locke in early March to send each of the plaintiffs the settlement form letter on CRI stationery that he was in the process of sending out to all TFG investors.  The letter provided in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Early last year this company acquired all the stock of Technology Finance Group, Inc.

This Company, and its subsidiary TFG, is now operated by new management.  We, the new management have reviewed TFG's books and records and concluded, to the best of our knowledge, in relation to the equipment owned by you, that TFG owes you Additional Rent....  Regrettably, over the past 5 years, prior management of TFG has not remitted sums to owners of equipment to a total amount of approximately $7 Million.  Further, we concluded, upon review of the financial statements of the Company ... that TFG does not have the financial resources to repay these funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Your concern and disappointment at the position in which you have been placed is extremely understandable.

However, despite the misrepresentation, plaintiffs were not confused about the relationship between the corporate entities, nor did they take any action in reliance on the new management language in the letter.  Although the majority of TFG's investors accepted the standard settlement package, plaintiffs declined to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs, who are Massachusetts residents, filed this diversity suit in the District of Massachusetts in 1990, alleging breach of contract, common law fraud, conversion, interference with contractual obligations, and violation of the Massachusetts deceptive trade practices statute, Mass.Gen.L. ch.  93A, &#167; 2.  Aware of TFG's precarious financial condition, the plaintiffs brought suit not only against TFG, but also against CRI, Locke, and Williamson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the evidence, the trial judge entered a directed verdict against the plaintiffs on the fraud claim concerning the computer they owned jointly.  The defendants then moved, pursuant to Rule 50(a), for judgment as a matter of law on various grounds, including a lack of personal jurisdiction.  The district court denied the motion, ruling that the personal jurisdiction issue had been waived, but even if it had not, that the jury could find the defendants had sufficient contacts with Massachusetts for a proper exercise of personal jurisdiction.  The jury found for the defendants on the remaining fraud and interference with contractual relations claims, but for the plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim.  The trial judge reserved decision on the Massachusetts deceptive trade practices claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the verdict, defendants again moved for judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Rule 50(b).  The trial court denied the motion.  At the same time, it ruled that the defendants had not violated the Massachusetts deceptive trade practices statute, finding that the decision to breach the contract with the plaintiffs was a valid business judgment rather than an attempt on the part of the defendants to line their pockets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants question whether there is personal jurisdiction over them under the Massachusetts long arm statute, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 223A, &#167; 3, and the United States Constitution.  The district court found that all three defendants had waived their objections to personal jurisdiction and that in any event, the jury could find that the defendants had sufficient contacts with Massachusetts for a proper exercise of jurisdiction.  The trial judge was plainly correct that CRI waived any objection to jurisdiction:  at the final pre-trial conference, defense counsel conceded there was no jurisdictional issue with respect to CRI.

Easterbrook &amp; Fischel, The Economic Structure of Corporate Law 55-56 &amp; n. 8 (1991) (explaining that a \"manager's incentive to undertake overly risky projects is greater in close corporations\").  Massachusetts apparently has not yet addressed the issue of piercing the corporate veil of a public corporation.  The key Massachusetts cases on piercing the corporate veil have all involved close, family-owned defendant corporations.

Plaintiffs clearly did not meet their burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence a \"confused intermingling\" of CRI's and TFG's activities with \"substantial disregard of the separate nature of the corporate entities,\" or \"serious ambiguity about the manner and capacity in which the [two] corporations and their respective representatives [were] acting.\"  My Bread, 233 N.E.2d at 752.   Defendants were extremely careful about maintaining the formal distinctions between CRI and TFG.  The two companies had distinct boards of directors, had separate board meetings, and each kept individual financial records.  There is no evidence showing that TFG was a sham or merely a shield behind which CRI could hide to escape liability for its own obligations.  Beneficial Fin.  Co., 275 N.E.2d at 91-92;  Gordon Chem.  Co., 266 N.E.2d at 657.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary evidence on which plaintiffs rely is TFG's movement of funds from a bank account in its own name in Connecticut into another TFG account in a Canadian bank in order to meet the payroll for TFG employees.  For several months, defendant Locke ran TFG's payroll out of his own attorney operating account in New York because steps had been taken to attach TFG's Connecticut account.  Locke was reimbursed with funds transferred out of the TFG Canadian account.  It is undisputed that the funds disbursed by Locke and repaid by TFG went only to TFG employees.  Plaintiffs were unaware of the transfers at the time and the transfers did not affect them.  This is not the sort of \"confused intermingling\" we think the Supreme Judicial Court had in mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that confused intermingling was evident from cash infusions into TFG by CRI, Locke and Williamson.  However, all the money transferred from CRI to TFG was in the form of loans that were properly recorded in the financial records of both corporations.  Moreover, there was insufficient competent evidence of transfers of money in the other direction, that is, from TFG to CRI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  These loans do not support the claim of confused intermingling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' argument that there was serious confusion about the manner and capacity in which the two corporations and their representatives acted is similarly unpersuasive.  There is no evidence that there was any confusion about on whose behalf a director was acting in any given instance.  Locke and Williamson, in their capacities as directors of both CRI and TFG, did sometimes act on behalf of both corporations simultaneously, but that is to be expected when individuals serve as directors for both a parent and its subsidiary.  It is also to be expected that when a subsidiary company profits, the parent company will as well.  That the fortunes of CRI and TFG were to some extent linked does not, as plaintiffs suggest, militate in favor of piercing the corporate veil.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs admitted they were not misled about the relationship between TFG and CRI.  Indeed, Massad did not even know that he had invested in TFG, let alone that CRI had become its parent.  Plaintiffs neither knew nor cared about the relationship between CRI and TFG, but rather relied on their financial advisor, Levinson, who understood the corporate relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first prong of the My Bread test, the evidence is only that Locke and Williamson served on the boards of both TFG and CRI.  Mere overlapping of boards does not meet the test of \"active and direct participation by the representatives of one corporation, apparently exercising some form of pervasive control.\"  My Bread, 233 N.E.2d at 752.   Moreover, plaintiffs have failed to show any \"fraudulent or injurious consequence of the intercorporate relationship.\"   Plaintiffs argue that the settlement offers were misleading and fraudulent, because defendants attributed the decision to retain investment returns to TFG's prior management, when it had been the decision of the new management to continue the policy of violating investment contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming this misrepresentation might have supported fraud or unfair practices claims against the defendants (claims the jury and court here rejected), we think plaintiffs' argument misses the point of the corporate disregard doctrine.  The phrase \"fraudulent or injurious consequence\" is limited in My Bread by the phrase \"of the intercorporate relationship.\"   There was no failure to \"make clear which corporation [was] taking action\" or \"to observe with care\" the corporate form.  My Bread, 233 N.E.2d at 752.   The Massachusetts Appeals Court has put this point well:  \"There is present in the cases which have looked through the corporate form an element of dubious manipulation and contrivance, finagling, such that corporate identities are confused and third parties cannot be quite certain with what they are dealing.\"  Evans, 574 N.E.2d at 400;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  cf.

My Bread sets the standard for deciding when to pierce the corporate veil under Massachusetts law;  Pepsi-Cola elucidates some factors that may be considered when engaging in a My Bread analysis.  Pepsi-Cola, 754 F.2d at 15.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The majority of the Pepsi-Cola factors cut against piercing the corporate veil in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs largely based their case against the individual defendants on a theory that the two defendants ran TFG for their personal benefit--that by drawing salaries and receiving certain benefits, the defendants were siphoning off corporate funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  But that theory is topsy-turvy:  managers should not be put to the Hobson's choice of either working for free or facing personal liability.  Such a rule would undercut, not advance, the policy reasons for the corporate disregard doctrine.  See Evans, 574 N.E.2d at 399 (benefit gained by individual defendants was a legitimate business purpose and so a factor pointing against veil piercing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, only one of the Pepsi-Cola factors can arguably be said to militate in favor of veil piercing here:  when plaintiffs' computers were sold, TFG was insolvent, unable to pay its debts as they fell due.

Trust Fund v. Uriarte Clean-Up Serv., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437189\"><a href=\"/opinion/437189/laborers-clean-up-contract-administration-trust-fund-v-uriarte-clean-up/\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span>, 525 (9th Cir.1984) (distinguishing, in dicta, the propriety of veil piercing when a subsidiary was undercapitalized at the outset from veil piercing when a subsidiary began with sufficient funds but subsequently fell upon hard times).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic contract was entered into between plaintiffs and TFG, and TFG became insolvent before CRI assumed ownership.  CRI bought TFG knowing that it was insolvent and pumped a great deal of money into TFG to try to make it profitable again.  That TFG may have continued to be undercapitalized in these circumstances does not argue for piercing the corporate veil.  Indeed, the contrary may well be true.  This is not a case involving a close corporation where the parent may \"form a subsidiary with minimal capitalization for the purpose of engaging in risky activities\" and where absolute limited liability would create \"incentives to engage in a socially excessive amount of risky activities.\"   Easterbrook &amp; Fischel, supra, at 57.   Nor is this a case of \"financial misconduct of the subsidiary involving such manipulation as asset-stripping or asset-siphoning, which depletes the resources of the subsidiary.\"   Blumberg, supra, &#167; 17.01, at 350.

Thus, this case does not involve an effort to hold a later parent responsible for the pre-parenthood activities of its new corporate child.  See, e.g., C.M. Corp. v. Oberer Dev.

Bump pierced the corporate veil despite the plaintiff's lack of confusion about with whom he was dealing, based on the particular facts and circumstances of the case and the belief that My Bread does not \"mak[e] such confusion an absolute requirement.\"  509 N.E.2d at 24.  Bump, which imposed liability on a parent under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, also involved findings of a de facto merger and an undisclosed principal and articulated its holding by stating that the parent \"was liable on agency principles\" for the conduct of its subsidiary.
