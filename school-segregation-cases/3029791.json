Ct. No. CGC13530290)\n         Defendant and Respondent.\n\n         Plaintiffs Walter and Remona Yee appeal from a judgment of dismissal following\nthe granting of the City and County of San Francisco’s special motion to strike under\nCode of Civil Procedure section 425.16 (the “anti-SLAPP statute”).\n         This lawsuit follows several rounds of construction on the Yee’s house in the\nSeacliff area. The first occurred in the late 1990’s, after an old City sewer collapsed,\ngiving rise to a sinkhole. The Yees sued the City for property damage and settled for\n$1.648 million. They then obtained a building permit to repair the damage, which was\nsigned off and “finaled” in 1999. Ten years later, after the Yees got into a property line\ndispute with neighbors and the neighbors complained about additional construction, the\nCity investigated, and concluded the Yees had made further additions to their house\nwithout the necessary permits. This led to a series of notices of violation and abatement\norders, and the Yees sought additional building permits and a variance, which were\ndenied. Although the Yees pursued an administrative appeal of the Planning\nCommission’s adverse ruling and denial of their last-sought permit and variance, they\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fhave never challenged these decisions, let alone successfully, in an administrative\nmandamus proceeding.\n         In 2012, the City issued an enforcement notice, and in 2013, notices of violation\nand penalties. The Yees filed this lawsuit one month after the issuance of the penalty\nnotice, alleging causes of action for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, inverse\ncondemnation, violation of title 42 United States Code section 1983 (taking without just\ncompensation), negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of\nemotional distress. The first four causes of action contend the Yees had a right to make\nthe additional improvements to their house pursuant to a promise the City allegedly made\nas part of the resolution of the sinkhole mess. The second two causes of action contend\nthe Yees have been whipsawed by the City in connection with the repair of their house,\ninitially approving and then disapproving the construction, including being wrongfully\naccused of misleading Planning Department officials and providing altered construction\nplans.\n         In the trial court, the City maintained a special motion to strike was proper\nbecause “the gravamen of the Yees’ lawsuit relates to DBI’s [Department of Building\nInspection] and Planning’s [Planning Department] permit, variance and enforcement\nactions” and “the determination that the Yees constructed additions to their Property\nwithout the benefit of permits and submitted false documents to DBI related to the\nconstruction.” The latter assertion referred to the construction plans the Yees provided to\nthe City during the investigation, which the Yees claim differed from the plans originally\napproved because of changes “in the field” necessitated and approved by City.\n         On appeal, the City acknowledges the first four causes of action challenge\ngovernment administrative actions that are generally not the sort that can be characterized\nas “protected activity” under the anti-SLAPP statute. Instead, the City now focuses on\nthe last two causes of action and maintains these are based on testimony by Planning\nDepartment officials before the Board of Appeal and, specifically, testimony that the\nYees provided misleading plans to the investigator. The City thus maintains these causes\nof action arise from statements made during “official proceedings authorized by law” and\n\n\n                                               2\n\fthus are subject to a special motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (e)(1).)1\nIt further maintains these statements undergird the first four causes of action, as well, thus\nmaking all causes of action susceptible to a special motion to strike. We disagree and\nconclude the first four causes of action are not amenable to initial attack by way of a\nspecial motion to strike. We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.\n                                                      2\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\nThe 1998 Construction Following the Storm Water Damage\n       In December 1995, sewer reconstruction activity and storm waters precipitated the\ncollapse of one of the City’s old brick-lined sewer tunnels in the Seacliff area, resulting in\nsignificant soil erosion and a large sinkhole. Both the ground failure and the City’s repair\nefforts damaged neighboring properties, including the Yees’ residence.\n       In August 1996, the Yees sued the City alleging multiple causes of action,\nincluding inverse condemnation, trespass, negligence and negligent infliction of\nemotional distress. The Yees alleged, among other things, that the City initially told\nthem their house would have to be bulldozed, but ultimately it was stabilized. They\nclaimed as losses, the “structural integrity of their residence and two levels, including the\nentire garage and its contents,” a permanent reduction in value due to “stigma” associated\nwith the ground failure, emotional distress, maintenance of an alternate residence, and\ncosts of repairs and attorneys’ fees.\n       In early 1998, the parties reached a settlement. The City paid the Yees $1.648\nmillion dollars. The Yees executed a release of all claims of any kind “which have\nexisted or may have existed, or which do exist, or which hereafter shall or may exist, and\nwhich (1) are alleged or set forth or attempted to be set forth in [the Yees’ lawsuit], or (2)\narise out of or are in any way related to any of the transactions, occurrences, acts or\nomissions set forth or alleged in any of the pleadings in [that lawsuit].” The Yees also\n\n       1\n         All further undesignated statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure\nunless otherwise indicated.\n       2\n         We grant the City’s motion for judicial notice of transcripts, compact disks, and\nminutes of various hearings related to this action. (Evid. Code, §§ 452, 459.)\n\n\n                                              3\n\fwaived the protections of Civil Code section 1542, agreeing to release any claims of\nadditional loss or injury “arising out of or in any way related to any of the events which\ngave rise to” the released claims.\n       The Yees also filed for a building permit (issued as no. 845616) to “[r]epair and\nrestore” the “two story” residence “to its pre-damaged condition,” which the Building\nDepartment approved in March 1998 (the “1998 permit”). While the City characterizes\nthe plans as including “a new one story addition over the garage,” the Yees maintain both\nthe garage and addition were already in existence.\n       The Yees further maintain the City assured them its erosion and sinkhole repairs\nwould include providing them with a new foundation for the part of their house damaged\nby the City’s repair efforts and on which they would be able to rebuild the house “as it\nwas prior to” the sewer collapse and erosion. However, over the course of its\nstabilization and repair work, the City made changes in its remedial efforts, which the\nYees claim resulted in modifications to their own reconstruction plans and which the City\nallegedly approved at that time. According to the Yees, the City essentially told them\nthey could “recapture” habitable living space that was lost due to the altered repair plans\nby adding living space elsewhere in the house.3 The Yees claim the rebuilding of their\nhouse was done in phases and all of it was done permissibly pursuant to the 1998 permit,\nwhich they characterize as an “emergency permit.”4\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         The City maintains any modification to an approved construction plan must be\nmade by way of a written revision request, subject to review and approval, and cannot be\nmade at the construction site.\n       4\n         In support of this assertion, the Yees submitted a copy of a June 13, 1998, note\nfrom their structural engineer to the Director of the Department of Building Inspection\nconfirming restoration and repair of the house “without design details and restrictions as\nshown on the schematic drawings . . . permit no. 845616 and any necessary revisions\nuntil completion.”\n\n\n                                             4\n\f      In any case, the 1998 permit was signed off and “finaled” (meaning, according to\nthe City, the permitted work was completed and inspected) a year and a half later, in\nNovember 1999.5\nThe Additional Work During the Mid-2000’s\n      In mid-2008, the Building Department received complaints from neighbors that\nthe Yees were making un-permitted additions to their residence.6 This precipitated an\ninvestigation by Edward Sweeney, then Deputy Director for Inspection Services for the\nDepartment of Building Inspection. Sweeney observed the ongoing construction,\nincluding a two-story addition and a deck over the garage. Walter Yee provided\nSweeney with plans showing the construction and indicated these were the plans that had\nbeen attached to the 1998 building permit.\n      After the inspection, one of the neighbors contacted Sweeney and claimed the\nplans Yee had given him were not, in fact, the plans that had been attached to and\napproved in conjunction with the 1998 permit. This neighbor also supplied satellite\nphotographs of the Yees property ostensibly taken in 2002 and early 2008 which did not\nshow the new construction.\n      Sweeney then researched the official plans and permits on file for the property.\nHe determined the plans Yee had given him during the site inspection were not the same\nas the plans attached to the 1998 permit. The plans attached to the approved 1998 permit\ndid not show the new construction Sweeney had observed.\n      Sweeney also found the Yees had obtained permits in 2004, 2005, and 2008 for\ncompleting work in connection with the 1998 permit.7 No additional plans were attached\n\n\n      5\n         Ten years later, the Planning Department concluded the plans approved in\nconnection with the 1998 permit showed inaccurate property lines, site plans and floor\nplans, and violated building setbacks in connection with the construction above the\ngarage.\n       6\n         In a 2009 decision, the Abatement Appeals Board found there was an ongoing\n“property line dispute” between the Yees and a neighbor.\n       7\n         For example, the 2004 permit application stated: “Reference made to original\nApplication 9802662, Special Permit 845616, to restore & repair a 2-story single family\n\n                                             5\n\fto these permit applications, and because the permits were for seemingly minor work in\nconnection with all-ready approved plans (e.g., estimated job costs of $3,000 to $6,000),\nthe permits were issued over the counter without review. However, according to\nSweeney, the permits should not have been issued, since the 1998 permit had already\nbeen finaled and the Yees failed to disclose that in the applications. In any case, these\npermits were allowed to expire without any work being approved or finaled by the\nDepartment.\n       Following Sweeney’s investigation, the Department of Building Inspection issued\ntwo Notices of Violation in July 2008, one for a “new third level added above garage”\nand one for a “horizontal bldg enlargement” at the southeast corner towards the rear of\nthe property. In February 2009, the Department issued a third notice for a “south wall”\nnot in compliance with plans and elevations not approved for “this rear area.” The\nmatters went to Director’s Hearings, and following a hearing, the Director of the Building\nInspection Department issued Abatement Orders.\n       The Yees appealed to the Abatement Appeals Board. Following a hearing, the\nBoard upheld the Abatement Orders and allowed the Yees one year to obtain additional\npermits they were seeking for the new construction and to resolve a property line dispute\nwith a neighbor. The Yees subsequently withdrew the applications. They claim they\nboth filed and withdrew these permit applications at the City’s suggestion. In the\nmeantime, Planning Department personnel met with the Yees and with neighbors in\nconnection with the permit applications and attempted to significantly scale back the\nunpermitted construction.\n       In January 2010, the Yees filed another permit application (No. 201001074358).\nThe application stated it was: “[T]o revise, correct and update additions built w/o proper\n\nresidence to its pre-damaged condition prior to the Seacliff sewer incident. Specifically,\nthis permit will update & restore the existing Sunroom & Terrace that was not finished.\nThis restoration work will be in accordance with the original permit previously approved\nand issued. Other repair work at the residence by CCSF/DPW permits 793329, 799077,\n809171 & 841459 is noted herein for reference to work performed & completed by the\nCity of San Francisco.”\n\n\n                                             6\n\fPermits and Planning Department review under section 311 requirements. Alteration of\nexisting single family dwelling to include 1) veranda @ 1st Flr. 2) Terrace & Study room\n@ 2d Flr. 3) Roof Deck @ 3rd Flr. and 4) Removal & rebuild portion of bldg. over\nproperty line at the rear S/E corner of the property. Reference is made to previous[ly]\napproved building Permit #9802662.” The estimated job cost was $22,000. This\napplication appears to have been initially or preliminarily approved.\n       In the course of reviewing the application, the Planning Department asked the\nYees to submit revised plans that eliminated some of the new additions, and in revised\nplans, the Yees agreed to pull back the additions above the garage that were encroaching\ninto the front setback area. However, they still needed a variance from the Zoning\nAdministrator for encroachment into the rear setback area.\n       As a result of the public notice required for the variance, two neighbors filed a\nrequest for discretionary review (one of which was subsequently withdrawn), asking the\nPlanning Commission to conduct a full review and hearing on the 2010 permit\napplication and to disapprove the new additions. At the hearing, the Building\nDepartment urged approval consistent with the revised 2010 plans that had resulted from\nthe department facilitated discussions.\n       The Commission, however, approved only “a modified project to legalize\nadditions to the subject property built without benefit of a building permit.” The\nCommission instructed staff to “approve the project pursuant to” the 1998 permit, “with\nexception to those portions that encroach over any property line. Those portions that\nencroach . . . shall be removed and pulled off of any property line by a minimum of one\nlinear foot; and the addition over the garage shall seek and justify a variance or be set\nback a minimum of three feet three inches from the front property line.” The\nCommission found, among other things, that the 1998 site and floor plans “are inaccurate\nand the project never received a variance from the front setback requirement,” the Yees\n“knowingly built beyond the scope of work approved” under the 1998 permit “into the\nrear yard, side yard, and front setback,” and the “illegal additions” violate the Planning\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fCode and “are out of scale with the existing character of buildings on the same block,\nacross the street and in the neighborhood.”\n       Following the Commission’s decision, the Zoning Administrator denied the Yees’\nrequest for a variance. The Administrator found, among other things, there were no\nextraordinary circumstances resulting in unnecessary hardship not created by the\napplicant. Rather, the Yees had, themselves, “expanded the rear of the building without\nbenefit of permit and now [sought] a variance to legalize this expansion; therefore, any\npractical difficulty or unnecessary hardship was created by” the Yees.\n       The Yees then asked the Planning Department to deny their 2010 permit\napplication altogether so they could appeal to the Board of Appeals.\n       The Board of Appeals heard the matter in August 2012 and upheld the denial of\nthe variance and denial of the 2010 permit application.\n       In December 2012, the Planning Department issued an Enforcement Notification\ndemanding that the non-permitted additions be removed. On January 31, 2013, and\nMarch 12, 2013, respectively, the Department issued a Notice of Violation and Penalty,\nand a Notice of Penalty, for failure to remove the additions.\nThis Lawsuit\n       Two weeks after the issuance of the penalty notice, the Yees filed this lawsuit on\nApril 3, 2013. They named as defendants the City, the Building Department, the\nPlanning Department, and the Planning Commission (the latter three, according to the\nCity, being “erroneously” named). They also included Doe defendants 1 through 50,\nalleged to be agents and employees of the named defendants.\n       The Yees alleged six causes of action. The first was for “declaratory relief.” The\nYees alleged they had initially been promised they would be able to rebuild their house\nexactly as it had been before the ground failure and sinkhole, but the City later concluded\nthis would not be possible given the repairs it needed to make to shore up the area. The\nCity then allegedly promised they could build out elsewhere, to “recapture” the habitable\nspace they had lost. The Yees claimed this was an enforceable promise, and as a result,\nthey were not required to obtain a variance or any other approval from the City, and their\n\n\n                                              8\n\fadditions were permissible and not subject to any investigation or enforcement action.\nTheir second cause of action was for “injunctive relief” and claimed the Yees were\nunable to occupy and enjoy their house and were suffering irreparable harm.\n       Their third cause of action was for “inverse condemnation.” The Yees alleged the\nCity’s initial approval of the scope of their construction and its subsequent reversal of\nposition, resulted in a “substantial portion” of their residence being taken for public use\nwithout just compensation. The fourth cause of action was for a “taking” of their\nproperty purportedly actionable under 42 U.S.C. section 1983.\n       The fifth and sixth causes of action were for, respectively, negligent and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress based on their alleged travails with the City\nplanning authorities for more than 18 years.\n       The City filed a special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute. As for the\n“first prong” of the anti-SLAPP analysis, the City claimed the “gravamen” of the Yees’\nclaims arose “from their dissatisfaction” with the permit, variance and enforcement\nactions taken in connection with their property, which included, according to the Yees,\nfalse statements they had mislead the Planning Department about the approved plans.\nThus, all the claims, asserted the City, were “based on the City’s exercise of first\nAmendment speech and petition rights” and subject to a special motion to strike. As for\nthe “second prong” of the analysis, the City maintained the first through fourth causes of\naction were (a) barred by applicable limitations periods and res judicata because the Yees\nfailed to successfully challenge the adverse determinations through administrative\nmandamus proceedings and (b) barred by the prior settlement and release in connection\nwith the storm water and sinkhole damage. The City maintained the fifth and sixth\ncauses of action were barred by statutory immunities under Government Code sections\n818.4 (for decisions in connection with permit approvals or disapprovals), 818.6 (for\ninspection actions), and 818.8 (for employee misrepresentations), and by the litigation\nprivilege.\n       The Yees maintained their claims were not based on any “protected activity” as to\nwhich a special motion to strike was proper. Rather, they were based on the fact the City\n\n\n                                               9\n\freneged on a promise the Yees could recoup habitable square footage they lost when the\nCity had to alter its sinkhole repair plans by making additions elsewhere to the house.\nThey further claimed they had made a showing on the merits sufficient to survive a\nspecial motion to strike.\n       The trial court granted the City’s motion. The court ruled the City met its initial\nburden of showing its “actions in the permitting process” were protected activity under\nthe anti-SLAPP statute. The court secondly ruled the Yees had not demonstrated a\nprobability of prevailing on the merits. Specifically, the first through fourth causes of\naction were barred by the settlement and release executed in 1996, and the fifth and sixth\ncauses of action were barred by Government Code section 818.4. The trial court did not\nrule on the City’s demurrer, filed at the same time as its special motion to strike and\nbased on the same substantive grounds.\n                                         DISCUSSION\n       Section 425.16, known as the anti-SLAPP statute, provides: “A cause of action\nagainst a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person’s right of\npetition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution\nin connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the\ncourt determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the\nplaintiff will prevail on the claim.” (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) “The Legislature enacted\nthe anti-SLAPP statute to address the societal ills caused by meritless lawsuits that are\nfiled to chill the exercise of First Amendment rights. [Citation.] The statute accomplishes\nthis end by providing a special procedure for striking meritless, chilling causes of action\nat the earliest possible stages of litigation.” (Gerbosi v. Gaims, Weil, West & Epstein,\nLLP (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 435, 443.)\n       “ ‘Under the statute, the court makes a two-step determination: “First, the court\ndecides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of\naction is one arising from protected activity. (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) ‘A defendant\nmeets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff’s cause fits one of\nthe categories spelled out in section 425.16, subdivision (e)’ [citation]. If the court finds\n\n\n                                              10\n\fthat such a showing has been made, it must then determine whether the plaintiff has\ndemonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim. (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1). . . .)”\n[Citations.] “Only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the anti-SLAPP\nstatute—i.e., that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal\nmerit—is a SLAPP, subject to being stricken under the statute.” [Citation.]’ ” (Tutor–\nSaliba Corp. v. Herrera (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 604, 609, italics omitted (Tutor–\nSaliba).)\n       An appellate court reviews an order granting or denying an anti-SLAPP motion de\nnovo. (Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 325–326 (Flatley); Schwarzburd v.\nKensington Police Protection & Community Services District Board (2014)\n225 Cal.App.4th 1345, 1350 (Schwarzburd.) This includes whether the challenged\nactivity is “protected.” (Tutor–Saliba, supra, 136 Cal.App.4th at p. 609.) We also\nindependently determine whether plaintiffs established a reasonable probability of\nsuccess on their claims. (Id. at p. 610.) “ ‘We consider “the pleadings, and supporting\nand opposing affidavits . . . upon which the liability or defense is based.” (§ 425.16,\nsubd. (b)(2).) However, we neither “weigh credibility [nor] compare the weight of the\nevidence. Rather, [we] accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff [citation] and\nevaluate the defendant’s evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by\nthe plaintiff as a matter of law.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Flatley, supra, 39 Cal.4th at\np. 326.)\nThe First Four Causes of Action\n       The Yees claim their first four causes of action—for declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, and inverse condemnation and a “taking”—are based on the City’s alleged breach\nof a promise that they could “recapture” habitable space they had lost and on their\ninability to fully occupy their house, none of which is “protected” activity under the anti-\nSLAPP statute. The City maintains, in turn, “each of these four causes of action is\npremised, in substantial part, on the Yees’ dissatisfaction with statements made by City\nemployees during administrative hearings . . . ” and thus are based on “protected” speech.\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       The anti-SLAPP statute applies only to causes of action “arising from” protected\nactivity—that is, activity “in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech\nunder the United States or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue.”\n(§ 425.16, subds. (b)(1), (e); Marlin v. Aimco Venezia, LLC (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 154,\n160 (Marlin).) Such activity includes: “(1) any written or oral statement or writing made\nbefore a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding\nauthorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with\nan issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any\nother official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement or writing\nmade in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public\ninterest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right\nof petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or\nan issue of public interest.” (§ 425.16, subd. (e); Marlin, at p.160.)\n       The “arising from” requirement is not satisfied simply because there is some\nrelationship between the cause of action and protected activity. “Fortunately the cases\nsuggest a more concrete test: a cause of action arises from protected conduct if the\nwrongful, injurious act(s) alleged by the plaintiff constitute protected conduct.” (Old\nRepublic Construction Program Group v. Boccardo Law Firm, Inc. (2014)\n230 Cal.App.4th 859, 868.) Thus, “the mere fact that an action was filed after protected\nactivity took place does not mean the action arose from that activity for the purposes of\nthe anti-SLAPP statute.” (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 89.) Even if a cause\nof action is “triggered” by protected activity, that does not mean the lawsuit arises from\nit. (Ibid.) Rather, “the critical consideration is whether the cause of action is based on\nthe defendant’s protected free speech or petitioning activity.” (Ibid.)\n       A “public official or government body, just like any private litigant, may make an\nanti-SLAPP motion where appropriate.” (San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District v.\nContra Costa County Employees’ Retirement Association (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 343,\n353 (San Ramon).) There is also “support for the argument that the protection accorded\nby the anti-SLAPP statute extends to statements made by public officials at an official\n\n\n                                             12\n\fpublic meeting, and perhaps also to their votes.” (Ibid.) However, “the fact that a\ncomplaint alleges that a public entity’s action was taken as a result of a majority vote of\nits constituent members does not mean that the litigation challenging that action arose\nfrom protected activity, where the measure itself is not an exercise of free speech or\npetition. Acts of governance mandated by law, without more, are not exercises of free\nspeech or petition. ‘[T]he defendant’s act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action must\nitself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech. [Citation.]’\n[Citation.]” (Id. at p. 354.)\n       The City concedes “acts of governance mandated by law . . . are not subject to the\nanti-SLAPP statute” and correctly recognizes the anti-SLAPP statute is inapplicable to\nlawsuits against a government entity for acts of governance, even though some\ngovernment speech is necessarily incidental to the government action.8 (See San Ramon,\nsupra, 125 Cal.App.4th at p. 357 [anti-SLAPP statute did not apply to a suit against a\ncounty retirement board for voting to charge the fire district “more for certain pension\ncontributions than the District believes is appropriate”]; Schwarzburd, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th 1345, 1355 [anti-SLAPP statute does not apply to suit against local police\nboard for unlawfully approving a retroactive pay increase to police chief]; Graffiti\nProtective Coatings, 181 Cal.App.4th 1207, 1224 [anti-SLAPP statute did not apply to\nsuit alleging city failed to follow laws relating to competitive bidding].)\n       The City maintains, however, that “[e]ach of these four causes of action is\npremised, in substantial part, on the Yees’ dissatisfaction with statements made by City\nemployees during administrative hearings that the Yees engaged in unpermitted\nconstruction, used falsified building plans, and otherwise provided false information to\nCity departments.” Thus, City claims the causes of action “arise[] in substantial part\n\n       8\n           While the City claims the Yees have waived the argument that their lawsuit\nchallenged “a final government decision” and not protected speech, the Yees sufficiently\nraised the issue, asserting in their opening brief that the “gravamen of the case is a taking\nwithout due process.” Moreover, on appeal we “review the record independently to\ndetermine whether the asserted cause of action arises from activity protected under the\nstatute. . . .” (Schwarzburd, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th 1345, 1350.)\n\n\n                                              13\n\ffrom a challenge to speech [and are] subject to an anti-SLAPP motion even if it also\nconcerns a governmental act,” relying on the assertedly “analogous” case of Mission\nOaks Ranch, Ltd. v. County of Santa Barbara (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 713 (Mission Oaks)\n[disapproved on another ground in Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope & Opportunity\n(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1123, fn.10].)\n       In Mission Oaks, a developer applied to the County of Santa Barbara to subdivide\nand develop property. (Mission Oaks, supra, 65 Cal.App.4th at p. 718.) After issuing a\n“request for proposal” to nine independent consultants to prepare the environmental\nimpact report (EIR), the county contracted with Envicom, which was to “exercise its own\nindependent judgment in accord with county guidelines,” in preparing the EIR. (Id. at\np. 719.) Mission Oaks agreed “that the adequacy of performance of consultant . . . shall\nbe determined at the sole discretion of County,” and that “final authority on all decisions\nconcerning the preparation of contractual documents lies in the sole discretion of\nCounty.” (Ibid.) The contract between the county and Envicom stated in part: “ ‘[T]he\ndraft EIR . . . and the final EIR must reflect the . . . County’s independent judgment. . . .\nAccordingly, the final responsibility and final authority on all questions concerning the\ncontent and quality of the EIR lies in the sole discretion of the County. . . . Consultant\nunderstands and agrees that its responsibility to provide a complete and accurate EIR is\nowed solely to County . . . and not to Applicant. . . .’” (Ibid.)\n       Envicom prepared an EIR which listed “a multitude of significant adverse\nunmitigable impacts presented by the project. . . .” (Mission Oaks, supra, 65 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 719.) Mission Oaks sued, claiming that Envicom and County “engaged in a\nconspiracy to commit fraud by predetermining that it would reject the project and . . .\n[that] County owed and breached its duty to Mission Oaks to comply with CEQA in\npreparing the EIR, . . . [asserting] it is a third party creditor beneficiary to the contract\nbetween the County and Envicom.” (Id. at p. 722.) Mission Oaks further alleged “the\nconsultants collusively prepared the EIR with the County in derogation of law and\nwithout factual support as part of a conspiracy to deny Mission Oaks the right to develop\nits property.” (Id. at p. 720.)\n\n\n                                               14\n\f       The court held “Mission Oaks is simply a disgruntled developer that does not like\nthe findings prepared by the independent environmental consultants for the County and\nthe public. Mission Oaks seeks to stifle the EIR . . . [and] coerce the County and the\nconsultants to change their views on the development proposal.” (Mission Oaks, supra,\n65 Cal.App.4th at 729.) “The anti-SLAPP statute is designed to preclude such attempts\nto silence those who speak out on matters of public interest before legislative bodies.”\n(Ibid.) As the court in San Ramon noted, the Mission Oaks “suit arose out of the\nsubmission of the environmental impact report to the county, and the court not\nsurprisingly held that this act constituted speech in connection with an issue of public\nconcern under consideration by a legislative body.” (San Ramon, supra, 125 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 357.)\n       In contrast, the first four causes of action in this case did not arise from protected\nspeech, but from alleged “acts of governance” and primarily from the City’s alleged\nbreach of a promise that the Yees could restore the habitable space in their home. (San\nRamon, supra, 125 Cal.App.4th at p. 354.) Simply because some speech occurred in\nconnection with the City’s actions does not transform those actions into protected\nexercises of free speech or petition. Contrary to City’s assertion, the gravamen of Yees’\nclaims is not their “dissatisfaction with statements made by City employees during\nadministrative hearings,” but rather, their dissatisfaction with the City’s reneging during\nthe course of the protracted administrative proceedings on an alleged promise to allow\nthem to “recoup habitable square feet” lost when the City altered its sinkhole repair plans.\n       Because the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute was not satisfied as to the first\nfour causes of action, the City’s special motion to strike should have been denied as to\nthose causes of action.\nThe Last Two Causes of Action\n       In contrast to the first four causes of action, the Yees’ fifth and sixth causes of\naction—for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress— were primarily\nbased on the speech of City employees. The Yees alleged they suffered emotional\ndistress due to the City’s “suggestion that [they] somehow were complicit in efforts by\n\n\n                                              15\n\funknown persons to falsify planning documents,” the City’s “false accusations against\nthe plaintiffs [and] disavow[als of] any knowledge or responsibility for the approvals that\nplaintiffs had relied upon, . . .[and] the City’s “accusations and insinuations.” The Yees\nfurther alleged the City intended to cause them emotional distress “or there was a reckless\ndisregard of the probability that [they] would suffer emotional distress, knowing that their\nremarks would be taken into consideration by the various boards and agencies of the\nCity. . . .”\n        “[I]t is clear, in light of both the language and purpose of California’s anti-SLAPP\nstatute, that the statutory remedy afforded by section 425.16 extends to statements and\nwritings of governmental entities and public officials on matters of public interest and\nconcern that would fall within the scope of the statute if such statements were made by a\nprivate individual or entity.” (Vargas v. City of Salinas (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1, 17\n(Vargas).) Section 425.16 “extends to public employees who issue reports and comment\non issues of public interest relating to their official duties. Where, as here, a\ngovernmental entity and its representatives are sued as a result of written and verbal\ncomments, both may move to dismiss under section 425.16.” (Bradbury v. Superior\nCourt (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1114–1115.) The Yees do not dispute that their\nemotional distress causes of action are based on statements made by City employees\nrelating to their official duties at “official proceedings authorized by law.” (§ 425.16,\nsubd. (e)(1).)\n        The burden thus shifted to the Yees to produce sufficient admissible evidence to\nestablish the probability of prevailing on the merits on their causes of action for\nemotional distress. (Schwarzburd, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1350.) “ ‘Put another\nway, the plaintiff “must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and\nsupported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if\nthe evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.” [Citations.]’ ” (Vargas, supra,\n46 Cal.4th at pp. 19–20.)\n        The Yees did not carry their burden in this regard. Among other problems they\nface, the actions of the planning department officials who investigated and reported on\n\n\n                                              16\n\fthe permitting situation of the Yees’ property, including stating the plans the Yees\nproduced during the investigation differed from the plans that had been approved by the\nCity, are subject to immunities under the Tort Claims Act.9\n       For example, Government Code section 821.6, provides, “A public employee is\nnot liable for injury caused by his instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative\nproceeding within the scope of his employment, even if he acts maliciously and without\nprobable cause.” (Gov. Code § 821.6.) This immunity is not limited to prosecutors and\nlaw enforcement personnel, but has been applied to any public employee involved in\ninvestigative or prosecutorial functions (e.g., Hardy v. Vial (1957) 48 Cal.2d 577, 583\n[school personnel investigating molestation allegations]; Gensburg v. Miller (1995)\n31 Cal.App.4th 512, 518 [social worker investigating child abuse allegations]), heads of\nadministrative departments (White v. Towers (1951) 37 Cal.2d 727, 732 [investigator of\nFish & Game Department]), county coroners (Stearns v. County of Los Angeles (1969)\n275 Cal.App.2d 134, 137), and members of county boards of supervisors (Dawson v.\nMartin (1957) 150 Cal.App.2d 379, 382). The immunity has been applied to a crime\nvictim’s claims against police officers for false imprisonment and intentional and\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress. (E.g., Amylou R. v. County of Riverside (1994)\n28 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1211–1212.) And similar to the present case, in White v. Brinkman\n(1937) 23 Cal.App.2d 307, 313–315, the immunity represented by section 821.6 was\napplied to a building inspector and a prosecuting attorney who plaintiff alleged\nmaliciously and without probable cause investigated alleged building code violations and\ninstigated a criminal prosecution against him. Likewise, in Dawson v. Rash (1958)\n160 Cal.App.2d 154, 161, the immunity precluded any civil liability against a building\ninspector investigating purported building code violations.10\n\n\n       9\n          The Yees’ appellate briefing did not even respond to, let alone attempt to refute,\nthe City’s assertion of statutory immunities.\n       10\n           Both White and Dawson, which predated the enactment of section 821.6,\nconferred upon the defendants the common law quasi-judicial immunity afforded public\nemployees performing their duties in connection with the judicial process. Section 821.6\n\n                                             17\n\f       The Yees’ emotional distress claims are based entirely on actions by the City’s\nbuilding inspection personnel while investigating and reporting on alleged code\nviolations—actions taken in their official capacity as code enforcement officials and in\nthe course and scope of their employment. Under section 821.6, no civil liability can be\nbased on this conduct.\n       Government Code section 818.4 provides: “A public entity is not liable for an\ninjury caused by the issuance, denial, suspension or revocation of, or by the failure or\nrefusal to issue, deny, suspend or revoke, any permit, license, certificate, approval, order,\nor similar authorization where the public entity or employee of the public entity is\nauthorized by enactment to determine whether or not such authorization should be issued,\ndenied, suspended or revoked.” (Gov. Code, § 818.4.) Similarly, section 821.2 provides:\n“A public employee is not liable for an injury caused by his issuance, denial, suspension\nor revocation of, or by his failure or refusal to issue, deny, suspend or revoke, any permit,\nlicense, certificate, approval, order, or similar authorization where he is authorized by\nenactment to determine whether or not such authorization should be issued, denied,\nsuspended or revoked.” (Gov. Code, § 821.2.) Numerous courts have held that decisions\nto issue or deny building permits are quintessential discretionary actions protected by\nthese immunities. (See generally Thompson v. City of Lake Elsinore (1993)\n18 Cal.App.4th 49,55.)\n       While the Yees attempt to segregate out the statements by building department\npersonnel they contend unfairly impugned their character and caused them emotional\ndistress, the comments were part and parcel of the administrative process by which their\napplications for a permit and variance were reviewed and denied. Accordingly, the\nimmunities provided by sections 818.4 and 821.2 apply. (See Freeny v. City of San\nBuenaventura (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1341–1345 [allegations of fraud, corruption\nand malice did not preclude statutory immunities, including section 821.2, protecting\n\n\n\nis a codification of that immunity. (See Sullivan v. County of Los Angeles (1974)\n12 Cal.3d 710, 720-721.)\n\n\n                                             18\n\findividual city council representatives who voted to deny conditional use permit and\nvariance].)11\n       Thus, on statutory immunity grounds, alone, the Yees failed to demonstrate a\nprobability of prevailing.12 Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting the City’s\nspecial motion to strike as to the fifth and sixth causes of action.\n                                        DISPOSITION\n       The judgment of dismissal is reversed as to the first four causes of action, and is\notherwise affirmed. The parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n           We need not, and do not, consider whether section 818.8, which provides that\n“[a] public entity is not liable for an injury caused by misrepresentation by an employee\nof the public entity, whether or not such misrepresentation be negligent or intentional,”\nalso applies. We note this immunity applies only to claims for deceit seeking damages\nfor economic or financial loss. (See, e.g., City of Costa Mesa v. D’Alessio Investments\nLLC (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 358, 383 [“[t]ort causes of action based on reputational\nharm (slander, trade libel, and intentional interference based on false statements to third\nparties) are not included within the “deceit” rubric identified by our Supreme Court when\nit interpreted Government Code sections 818.8 and 822.2”].)\n        12\n           We therefore do not consider the other asserted deficiencies in the Yees’\nemotional distress claims.\n\n\n                                              19\n\f                                              _________________________\n                                              Banke, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nMargulies, Acting P.

Ct. No. CGC13530290)\n         Defendant and Respondent.\n\n         Plaintiffs Walter and Remona Yee appeal from a judgment of dismissal following\nthe granting of the City and County of San Francisco’s special motion to strike under\nCode of Civil Procedure section 425.16 (the “anti-SLAPP statute”).\n         This lawsuit follows several rounds of construction on the Yee’s house in the\nSeacliff area. The first occurred in the late 1990’s, after an old City sewer collapsed,\ngiving rise to a sinkhole. The Yees sued the City for property damage and settled for\n$1.648 million. They then obtained a building permit to repair the damage, which was\nsigned off and “finaled” in 1999. Ten years later, after the Yees got into a property line\ndispute with neighbors and the neighbors complained about additional construction, the\nCity investigated, and concluded the Yees had made further additions to their house\nwithout the necessary permits. This led to a series of notices of violation and abatement\norders, and the Yees sought additional building permits and a variance, which were\ndenied. Although the Yees pursued an administrative appeal of the Planning\nCommission’s adverse ruling and denial of their last-sought permit and variance, they\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fhave never challenged these decisions, let alone successfully, in an administrative\nmandamus proceeding.\n         In 2012, the City issued an enforcement notice, and in 2013, notices of violation\nand penalties. The Yees filed this lawsuit one month after the issuance of the penalty\nnotice, alleging causes of action for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, inverse\ncondemnation, violation of title 42 United States Code section 1983 (taking without just\ncompensation), negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of\nemotional distress. The first four causes of action contend the Yees had a right to make\nthe additional improvements to their house pursuant to a promise the City allegedly made\nas part of the resolution of the sinkhole mess. The second two causes of action contend\nthe Yees have been whipsawed by the City in connection with the repair of their house,\ninitially approving and then disapproving the construction, including being wrongfully\naccused of misleading Planning Department officials and providing altered construction\nplans.\n         In the trial court, the City maintained a special motion to strike was proper\nbecause “the gravamen of the Yees’ lawsuit relates to DBI’s [Department of Building\nInspection] and Planning’s [Planning Department] permit, variance and enforcement\nactions” and “the determination that the Yees constructed additions to their Property\nwithout the benefit of permits and submitted false documents to DBI related to the\nconstruction.” The latter assertion referred to the construction plans the Yees provided to\nthe City during the investigation, which the Yees claim differed from the plans originally\napproved because of changes “in the field” necessitated and approved by City.\n         On appeal, the City acknowledges the first four causes of action challenge\ngovernment administrative actions that are generally not the sort that can be characterized\nas “protected activity” under the anti-SLAPP statute. Instead, the City now focuses on\nthe last two causes of action and maintains these are based on testimony by Planning\nDepartment officials before the Board of Appeal and, specifically, testimony that the\nYees provided misleading plans to the investigator. The City thus maintains these causes\nof action arise from statements made during “official proceedings authorized by law” and\n\n\n                                               2\n\fthus are subject to a special motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (e)(1).)1\nIt further maintains these statements undergird the first four causes of action, as well, thus\nmaking all causes of action susceptible to a special motion to strike. We disagree and\nconclude the first four causes of action are not amenable to initial attack by way of a\nspecial motion to strike. We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.\n                                                      2\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\nThe 1998 Construction Following the Storm Water Damage\n       In December 1995, sewer reconstruction activity and storm waters precipitated the\ncollapse of one of the City’s old brick-lined sewer tunnels in the Seacliff area, resulting in\nsignificant soil erosion and a large sinkhole. Both the ground failure and the City’s repair\nefforts damaged neighboring properties, including the Yees’ residence.\n       In August 1996, the Yees sued the City alleging multiple causes of action,\nincluding inverse condemnation, trespass, negligence and negligent infliction of\nemotional distress. The Yees alleged, among other things, that the City initially told\nthem their house would have to be bulldozed, but ultimately it was stabilized. They\nclaimed as losses, the “structural integrity of their residence and two levels, including the\nentire garage and its contents,” a permanent reduction in value due to “stigma” associated\nwith the ground failure, emotional distress, maintenance of an alternate residence, and\ncosts of repairs and attorneys’ fees.\n       In early 1998, the parties reached a settlement. The City paid the Yees $1.648\nmillion dollars. The Yees executed a release of all claims of any kind “which have\nexisted or may have existed, or which do exist, or which hereafter shall or may exist, and\nwhich (1) are alleged or set forth or attempted to be set forth in [the Yees’ lawsuit], or (2)\narise out of or are in any way related to any of the transactions, occurrences, acts or\nomissions set forth or alleged in any of the pleadings in [that lawsuit].” The Yees also\n\n       1\n         All further undesignated statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure\nunless otherwise indicated.\n       2\n         We grant the City’s motion for judicial notice of transcripts, compact disks, and\nminutes of various hearings related to this action. (Evid. Code, §§ 452, 459.)\n\n\n                                              3\n\fwaived the protections of Civil Code section 1542, agreeing to release any claims of\nadditional loss or injury “arising out of or in any way related to any of the events which\ngave rise to” the released claims.\n       The Yees also filed for a building permit (issued as no. 845616) to “[r]epair and\nrestore” the “two story” residence “to its pre-damaged condition,” which the Building\nDepartment approved in March 1998 (the “1998 permit”). While the City characterizes\nthe plans as including “a new one story addition over the garage,” the Yees maintain both\nthe garage and addition were already in existence.\n       The Yees further maintain the City assured them its erosion and sinkhole repairs\nwould include providing them with a new foundation for the part of their house damaged\nby the City’s repair efforts and on which they would be able to rebuild the house “as it\nwas prior to” the sewer collapse and erosion. However, over the course of its\nstabilization and repair work, the City made changes in its remedial efforts, which the\nYees claim resulted in modifications to their own reconstruction plans and which the City\nallegedly approved at that time. According to the Yees, the City essentially told them\nthey could “recapture” habitable living space that was lost due to the altered repair plans\nby adding living space elsewhere in the house.3 The Yees claim the rebuilding of their\nhouse was done in phases and all of it was done permissibly pursuant to the 1998 permit,\nwhich they characterize as an “emergency permit.”4\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         The City maintains any modification to an approved construction plan must be\nmade by way of a written revision request, subject to review and approval, and cannot be\nmade at the construction site.\n       4\n         In support of this assertion, the Yees submitted a copy of a June 13, 1998, note\nfrom their structural engineer to the Director of the Department of Building Inspection\nconfirming restoration and repair of the house “without design details and restrictions as\nshown on the schematic drawings . . . permit no. 845616 and any necessary revisions\nuntil completion.”\n\n\n                                             4\n\f      In any case, the 1998 permit was signed off and “finaled” (meaning, according to\nthe City, the permitted work was completed and inspected) a year and a half later, in\nNovember 1999.5\nThe Additional Work During the Mid-2000’s\n      In mid-2008, the Building Department received complaints from neighbors that\nthe Yees were making un-permitted additions to their residence.6 This precipitated an\ninvestigation by Edward Sweeney, then Deputy Director for Inspection Services for the\nDepartment of Building Inspection. Sweeney observed the ongoing construction,\nincluding a two-story addition and a deck over the garage. Walter Yee provided\nSweeney with plans showing the construction and indicated these were the plans that had\nbeen attached to the 1998 building permit.\n      After the inspection, one of the neighbors contacted Sweeney and claimed the\nplans Yee had given him were not, in fact, the plans that had been attached to and\napproved in conjunction with the 1998 permit. This neighbor also supplied satellite\nphotographs of the Yees property ostensibly taken in 2002 and early 2008 which did not\nshow the new construction.\n      Sweeney then researched the official plans and permits on file for the property.\nHe determined the plans Yee had given him during the site inspection were not the same\nas the plans attached to the 1998 permit. The plans attached to the approved 1998 permit\ndid not show the new construction Sweeney had observed.\n      Sweeney also found the Yees had obtained permits in 2004, 2005, and 2008 for\ncompleting work in connection with the 1998 permit.7 No additional plans were attached\n\n\n      5\n         Ten years later, the Planning Department concluded the plans approved in\nconnection with the 1998 permit showed inaccurate property lines, site plans and floor\nplans, and violated building setbacks in connection with the construction above the\ngarage.\n       6\n         In a 2009 decision, the Abatement Appeals Board found there was an ongoing\n“property line dispute” between the Yees and a neighbor.\n       7\n         For example, the 2004 permit application stated: “Reference made to original\nApplication 9802662, Special Permit 845616, to restore & repair a 2-story single family\n\n                                             5\n\fto these permit applications, and because the permits were for seemingly minor work in\nconnection with all-ready approved plans (e.g., estimated job costs of $3,000 to $6,000),\nthe permits were issued over the counter without review. However, according to\nSweeney, the permits should not have been issued, since the 1998 permit had already\nbeen finaled and the Yees failed to disclose that in the applications. In any case, these\npermits were allowed to expire without any work being approved or finaled by the\nDepartment.\n       Following Sweeney’s investigation, the Department of Building Inspection issued\ntwo Notices of Violation in July 2008, one for a “new third level added above garage”\nand one for a “horizontal bldg enlargement” at the southeast corner towards the rear of\nthe property. In February 2009, the Department issued a third notice for a “south wall”\nnot in compliance with plans and elevations not approved for “this rear area.” The\nmatters went to Director’s Hearings, and following a hearing, the Director of the Building\nInspection Department issued Abatement Orders.\n       The Yees appealed to the Abatement Appeals Board. Following a hearing, the\nBoard upheld the Abatement Orders and allowed the Yees one year to obtain additional\npermits they were seeking for the new construction and to resolve a property line dispute\nwith a neighbor. The Yees subsequently withdrew the applications. They claim they\nboth filed and withdrew these permit applications at the City’s suggestion. In the\nmeantime, Planning Department personnel met with the Yees and with neighbors in\nconnection with the permit applications and attempted to significantly scale back the\nunpermitted construction.\n       In January 2010, the Yees filed another permit application (No. 201001074358).\nThe application stated it was: “[T]o revise, correct and update additions built w/o proper\n\nresidence to its pre-damaged condition prior to the Seacliff sewer incident. Specifically,\nthis permit will update & restore the existing Sunroom & Terrace that was not finished.\nThis restoration work will be in accordance with the original permit previously approved\nand issued. Other repair work at the residence by CCSF/DPW permits 793329, 799077,\n809171 & 841459 is noted herein for reference to work performed & completed by the\nCity of San Francisco.”\n\n\n                                             6\n\fPermits and Planning Department review under section 311 requirements. Alteration of\nexisting single family dwelling to include 1) veranda @ 1st Flr. 2) Terrace & Study room\n@ 2d Flr. 3) Roof Deck @ 3rd Flr. and 4) Removal & rebuild portion of bldg. over\nproperty line at the rear S/E corner of the property. Reference is made to previous[ly]\napproved building Permit #9802662.” The estimated job cost was $22,000. This\napplication appears to have been initially or preliminarily approved.\n       In the course of reviewing the application, the Planning Department asked the\nYees to submit revised plans that eliminated some of the new additions, and in revised\nplans, the Yees agreed to pull back the additions above the garage that were encroaching\ninto the front setback area. However, they still needed a variance from the Zoning\nAdministrator for encroachment into the rear setback area.\n       As a result of the public notice required for the variance, two neighbors filed a\nrequest for discretionary review (one of which was subsequently withdrawn), asking the\nPlanning Commission to conduct a full review and hearing on the 2010 permit\napplication and to disapprove the new additions. At the hearing, the Building\nDepartment urged approval consistent with the revised 2010 plans that had resulted from\nthe department facilitated discussions.\n       The Commission, however, approved only “a modified project to legalize\nadditions to the subject property built without benefit of a building permit.” The\nCommission instructed staff to “approve the project pursuant to” the 1998 permit, “with\nexception to those portions that encroach over any property line. Those portions that\nencroach . . . shall be removed and pulled off of any property line by a minimum of one\nlinear foot; and the addition over the garage shall seek and justify a variance or be set\nback a minimum of three feet three inches from the front property line.” The\nCommission found, among other things, that the 1998 site and floor plans “are inaccurate\nand the project never received a variance from the front setback requirement,” the Yees\n“knowingly built beyond the scope of work approved” under the 1998 permit “into the\nrear yard, side yard, and front setback,” and the “illegal additions” violate the Planning\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fCode and “are out of scale with the existing character of buildings on the same block,\nacross the street and in the neighborhood.”\n       Following the Commission’s decision, the Zoning Administrator denied the Yees’\nrequest for a variance. The Administrator found, among other things, there were no\nextraordinary circumstances resulting in unnecessary hardship not created by the\napplicant. Rather, the Yees had, themselves, “expanded the rear of the building without\nbenefit of permit and now [sought] a variance to legalize this expansion; therefore, any\npractical difficulty or unnecessary hardship was created by” the Yees.\n       The Yees then asked the Planning Department to deny their 2010 permit\napplication altogether so they could appeal to the Board of Appeals.\n       The Board of Appeals heard the matter in August 2012 and upheld the denial of\nthe variance and denial of the 2010 permit application.\n       In December 2012, the Planning Department issued an Enforcement Notification\ndemanding that the non-permitted additions be removed. On January 31, 2013, and\nMarch 12, 2013, respectively, the Department issued a Notice of Violation and Penalty,\nand a Notice of Penalty, for failure to remove the additions.\nThis Lawsuit\n       Two weeks after the issuance of the penalty notice, the Yees filed this lawsuit on\nApril 3, 2013. They named as defendants the City, the Building Department, the\nPlanning Department, and the Planning Commission (the latter three, according to the\nCity, being “erroneously” named). They also included Doe defendants 1 through 50,\nalleged to be agents and employees of the named defendants.\n       The Yees alleged six causes of action. The first was for “declaratory relief.” The\nYees alleged they had initially been promised they would be able to rebuild their house\nexactly as it had been before the ground failure and sinkhole, but the City later concluded\nthis would not be possible given the repairs it needed to make to shore up the area. The\nCity then allegedly promised they could build out elsewhere, to “recapture” the habitable\nspace they had lost. The Yees claimed this was an enforceable promise, and as a result,\nthey were not required to obtain a variance or any other approval from the City, and their\n\n\n                                              8\n\fadditions were permissible and not subject to any investigation or enforcement action.\nTheir second cause of action was for “injunctive relief” and claimed the Yees were\nunable to occupy and enjoy their house and were suffering irreparable harm.\n       Their third cause of action was for “inverse condemnation.” The Yees alleged the\nCity’s initial approval of the scope of their construction and its subsequent reversal of\nposition, resulted in a “substantial portion” of their residence being taken for public use\nwithout just compensation. The fourth cause of action was for a “taking” of their\nproperty purportedly actionable under 42 U.S.C. section 1983.\n       The fifth and sixth causes of action were for, respectively, negligent and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress based on their alleged travails with the City\nplanning authorities for more than 18 years.\n       The City filed a special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute. As for the\n“first prong” of the anti-SLAPP analysis, the City claimed the “gravamen” of the Yees’\nclaims arose “from their dissatisfaction” with the permit, variance and enforcement\nactions taken in connection with their property, which included, according to the Yees,\nfalse statements they had mislead the Planning Department about the approved plans.\nThus, all the claims, asserted the City, were “based on the City’s exercise of first\nAmendment speech and petition rights” and subject to a special motion to strike. As for\nthe “second prong” of the analysis, the City maintained the first through fourth causes of\naction were (a) barred by applicable limitations periods and res judicata because the Yees\nfailed to successfully challenge the adverse determinations through administrative\nmandamus proceedings and (b) barred by the prior settlement and release in connection\nwith the storm water and sinkhole damage. The City maintained the fifth and sixth\ncauses of action were barred by statutory immunities under Government Code sections\n818.4 (for decisions in connection with permit approvals or disapprovals), 818.6 (for\ninspection actions), and 818.8 (for employee misrepresentations), and by the litigation\nprivilege.\n       The Yees maintained their claims were not based on any “protected activity” as to\nwhich a special motion to strike was proper. Rather, they were based on the fact the City\n\n\n                                               9\n\freneged on a promise the Yees could recoup habitable square footage they lost when the\nCity had to alter its sinkhole repair plans by making additions elsewhere to the house.\nThey further claimed they had made a showing on the merits sufficient to survive a\nspecial motion to strike.\n       The trial court granted the City’s motion. The court ruled the City met its initial\nburden of showing its “actions in the permitting process” were protected activity under\nthe anti-SLAPP statute. The court secondly ruled the Yees had not demonstrated a\nprobability of prevailing on the merits. Specifically, the first through fourth causes of\naction were barred by the settlement and release executed in 1996, and the fifth and sixth\ncauses of action were barred by Government Code section 818.4. The trial court did not\nrule on the City’s demurrer, filed at the same time as its special motion to strike and\nbased on the same substantive grounds.\n                                         DISCUSSION\n       Section 425.16, known as the anti-SLAPP statute, provides: “A cause of action\nagainst a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person’s right of\npetition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution\nin connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the\ncourt determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the\nplaintiff will prevail on the claim.” (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) “The Legislature enacted\nthe anti-SLAPP statute to address the societal ills caused by meritless lawsuits that are\nfiled to chill the exercise of First Amendment rights.

(e); Marlin, at p.160.)\n       The “arising from” requirement is not satisfied simply because there is some\nrelationship between the cause of action and protected activity. “Fortunately the cases\nsuggest a more concrete test: a cause of action arises from protected conduct if the\nwrongful, injurious act(s) alleged by the plaintiff constitute protected conduct.” (Old\nRepublic Construction Program Group v.

Even if a cause\nof action is “triggered” by protected activity, that does not mean the lawsuit arises from\nit. (Ibid.)

However, “the fact that a\ncomplaint alleges that a public entity’s action was taken as a result of a majority vote of\nits constituent members does not mean that the litigation challenging that action arose\nfrom protected activity, where the measure itself is not an exercise of free speech or\npetition.

After issuing a\n“request for proposal” to nine independent consultants to prepare the environmental\nimpact report (EIR), the county contracted with Envicom, which was to “exercise its own\nindependent judgment in accord with county guidelines,” in preparing the EIR. (Id. at\np. 719.) Mission Oaks agreed “that the adequacy of performance of consultant . . . shall\nbe determined at the sole discretion of County,” and that “final authority on all decisions\nconcerning the preparation of contractual documents lies in the sole discretion of\nCounty.” (Ibid.) The contract between the county and Envicom stated in part: “ ‘[T]he\ndraft EIR . . . and the final EIR must reflect the . . . County’s independent judgment. . . .\nAccordingly, the final responsibility and final authority on all questions concerning the\ncontent and quality of the EIR lies in the sole discretion of the County. . . . Consultant\nunderstands and agrees that its responsibility to provide a complete and accurate EIR is\nowed solely to County . . . and not to Applicant. . . .’” (Ibid.)\n       Envicom prepared an EIR which listed “a multitude of significant adverse\nunmitigable impacts presented by the project. . . .” (Mission Oaks, supra, 65 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 719.) Mission Oaks sued, claiming that Envicom and County “engaged in a\nconspiracy to commit fraud by predetermining that it would reject the project and . . .\n[that] County owed and breached its duty to Mission Oaks to comply with CEQA in\npreparing the EIR, . . . [asserting] it is a third party creditor beneficiary to the contract\nbetween the County and Envicom.” (Id. at p. 722.) Mission Oaks further alleged “the\nconsultants collusively prepared the EIR with the County in derogation of law and\nwithout factual support as part of a conspiracy to deny Mission Oaks the right to develop\nits property.” (Id. at p. 720.)\n\n\n                                               14\n\f       The court held “Mission Oaks is simply a disgruntled developer that does not like\nthe findings prepared by the independent environmental consultants for the County and\nthe public. Mission Oaks seeks to stifle the EIR . . . [and] coerce the County and the\nconsultants to change their views on the development proposal.” (Mission Oaks, supra,\n65 Cal.App.4th at 729.) “The anti-SLAPP statute is designed to preclude such attempts\nto silence those who speak out on matters of public interest before legislative bodies.”\n(Ibid.) As the court in San Ramon noted, the Mission Oaks “suit arose out of the\nsubmission of the environmental impact report to the county, and the court not\nsurprisingly held that this act constituted speech in connection with an issue of public\nconcern under consideration by a legislative body.” (San Ramon, supra, 125 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 357.)\n       In contrast, the first four causes of action in this case did not arise from protected\nspeech, but from alleged “acts of governance” and primarily from the City’s alleged\nbreach of a promise that the Yees could restore the habitable space in their home. (San\nRamon, supra, 125 Cal.App.4th at p. 354.) Simply because some speech occurred in\nconnection with the City’s actions does not transform those actions into protected\nexercises of free speech or petition. Contrary to City’s assertion, the gravamen of Yees’\nclaims is not their “dissatisfaction with statements made by City employees during\nadministrative hearings,” but rather, their dissatisfaction with the City’s reneging during\nthe course of the protracted administrative proceedings on an alleged promise to allow\nthem to “recoup habitable square feet” lost when the City altered its sinkhole repair plans.\n       Because the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute was not satisfied as to the first\nfour causes of action, the City’s special motion to strike should have been denied as to\nthose causes of action.\nThe Last Two Causes of Action\n       In contrast to the first four causes of action, the Yees’ fifth and sixth causes of\naction—for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress— were primarily\nbased on the speech of City employees. The Yees alleged they suffered emotional\ndistress due to the City’s “suggestion that [they] somehow were complicit in efforts by\n\n\n                                              15\n\funknown persons to falsify planning documents,” the City’s “false accusations against\nthe plaintiffs [and] disavow[als of] any knowledge or responsibility for the approvals that\nplaintiffs had relied upon, . . .[and] the City’s “accusations and insinuations.” The Yees\nfurther alleged the City intended to cause them emotional distress “or there was a reckless\ndisregard of the probability that [they] would suffer emotional distress, knowing that their\nremarks would be taken into consideration by the various boards and agencies of the\nCity. . . .”\n        “[I]t is clear, in light of both the language and purpose of California’s anti-SLAPP\nstatute, that the statutory remedy afforded by section 425.16 extends to statements and\nwritings of governmental entities and public officials on matters of public interest and\nconcern that would fall within the scope of the statute if such statements were made by a\nprivate individual or entity.” (Vargas v. City of Salinas (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801747\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801747/vargas-v-city-of-salinas/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17\n(Vargas).) Section 425.16 “extends to public employees who issue reports and comment\non issues of public interest relating to their official duties. Where, as here, a\ngovernmental entity and its representatives are sued as a result of written and verbal\ncomments, both may move to dismiss under section 425.16.” (Bradbury v. Superior\nCourt (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2254545\"><a href=\"/opinion/2254545/bradbury-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1114–1115.) The Yees do not dispute that their\nemotional distress causes of action are based on statements made by City employees\nrelating to their official duties at “official proceedings authorized by law.” (§ 425.16,\nsubd. (e)(1).)\n        The burden thus shifted to the Yees to produce sufficient admissible evidence to\nestablish the probability of prevailing on the merits on their causes of action for\nemotional distress. (Schwarzburd, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1350.) “ ‘Put another\nway, the plaintiff “must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and\nsupported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if\nthe evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.” [Citations.]’ ” (Vargas, supra,\n46 Cal.4th at pp. 19–20.)\n        The Yees did not carry their burden in this regard. Among other problems they\nface, the actions of the planning department officials who investigated and reported on\n\n\n                                              16\n\fthe permitting situation of the Yees’ property, including stating the plans the Yees\nproduced during the investigation differed from the plans that had been approved by the\nCity, are subject to immunities under the Tort Claims Act.9\n       For example, Government Code section 821.6, provides, “A public employee is\nnot liable for injury caused by his instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative\nproceeding within the scope of his employment, even if he acts maliciously and without\nprobable cause.” (Gov. Code § 821.6.) This immunity is not limited to prosecutors and\nlaw enforcement personnel, but has been applied to any public employee involved in\ninvestigative or prosecutorial functions (e.g., Hardy v. Vial (1957) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583\n[school personnel investigating molestation allegations]; Gensburg v.

The immunity has been applied to a crime\nvictim’s claims against police officers for false imprisonment and intentional and\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress. (E.g., Amylou R. v. County of Riverside (1994)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1211–1212.) And similar to the present case, in White v.

Likewise, in Dawson v. Rash (1958)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2605477\"><a href=\"/opinion/2605477/dawson-v-rash/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Section 821.6\n\n                                             17\n\f       The Yees’ emotional distress claims are based entirely on actions by the City’s\nbuilding inspection personnel while investigating and reporting on alleged code\nviolations—actions taken in their official capacity as code enforcement officials and in\nthe course and scope of their employment. Under section 821.6, no civil liability can be\nbased on this conduct.\n       Government Code section 818.4 provides: “A public entity is not liable for an\ninjury caused by the issuance, denial, suspension or revocation of, or by the failure or\nrefusal to issue, deny, suspend or revoke, any permit, license, certificate, approval, order,\nor similar authorization where the public entity or employee of the public entity is\nauthorized by enactment to determine whether or not such authorization should be issued,\ndenied, suspended or revoked.” (Gov. Code, § 818.4.) Similarly, section 821.2 provides:\n“A public employee is not liable for an injury caused by his issuance, denial, suspension\nor revocation of, or by his failure or refusal to issue, deny, suspend or revoke, any permit,\nlicense, certificate, approval, order, or similar authorization where he is authorized by\nenactment to determine whether or not such authorization should be issued, denied,\nsuspended or revoked.” (Gov. Code, § 821.2.) Numerous courts have held that decisions\nto issue or deny building permits are quintessential discretionary actions protected by\nthese immunities. (See generally Thompson v. City of Lake Elsinore (1993)\n18 Cal.App.4th 49,55.)\n       While the Yees attempt to segregate out the statements by building department\npersonnel they contend unfairly impugned their character and caused them emotional\ndistress, the comments were part and parcel of the administrative process by which their\napplications for a permit and variance were reviewed and denied. Accordingly, the\nimmunities provided by sections 818.4 and 821.2 apply. (See Freeny v. City of San\nBuenaventura (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1333</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1341–1345 [allegations of fraud, corruption\nand malice did not preclude statutory immunities, including section 821.2, protecting\n\n\n\nis a codification of that immunity.

We note this immunity applies only to claims for deceit seeking damages\nfor economic or financial loss. (See, e.g., City of Costa Mesa v.
