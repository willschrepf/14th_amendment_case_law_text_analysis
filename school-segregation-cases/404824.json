OWEN, Circuit Judge:\n      St. Martin Parish School Board (the School Board) appeals the district\ncourt’s denial of its motions to dismiss this desegregation case originally filed in\n1965 by Theresa Thomas, on behalf of D.M.T., E.J.T., and V.A.T.; Alphonse\nFontnette, on behalf of J.F.; and Benjamin Roy, on behalf of M.H. and K.H.\n(collectively, Plaintiffs). We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n      *\n          District Judge of the Eastern District of Louisiana, sitting by designation.\n\f    Case: 12-30850     Document: 00512674560      Page: 2   Date Filed: 06/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-30850\n\n                                        I\n      This case concerns the district court’s decision to revisit a school\ndesegregation case in which the last order prior to 2009 was entered in 1974 (the\n1974 Order). In 1965, Plaintiffs filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nalleging that the School Board was operating a segregated school system (a “dual\nsystem”) and seeking injunctive relief. In September 1965, the presiding judge,\nJudge Richard Putnam, found that the School Board had engaged in intentional\ndiscrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment and ordered the immediate desegregation of all grades in the School\nBoard’s system. At the same time, the court approved the initial plan of\ndesegregation proposed by the School Board.\n      In July 1969, the School Board proposed a new plan of desegregation. The\ndistrict court approved the plan at that time and issued an amended judgment\nregarding the desegregation plan in December 1971. Over the next several\nyears, the district court received regular reports from the School Board reporting\nthe status of its desegregation effort, approved certain changes to the\ndesegregation plan requested by the parties, and made various other rulings.\n      In July 1974, Judge Putnam issued an order directing the parties to file\nbriefs on several issues, including “[w]hether or not this school system has\nachieved a unitary status, has maintained such status for a period of two years,\nand the decree of th[e] Court should be dissolved” as of that time. The decree\nthat followed—the 1974 Order—stated, in pertinent part, as follows:\n      II. The objective criteria filed by the Board and set out in the\n      Board’s Policy Manual for Hiring and Promoting of faculty and staff\n      members within and for said system may be continued in operation,\n      subject to the conditions imposed upon defendants with regard to\n      the future operations of the public school system . . . , and reserving\n      to all parties the right to raise this issue within the two year period\n      hereinafter stated in paragraph VI.\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f    Case: 12-30850     Document: 00512674560      Page: 3    Date Filed: 06/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-30850\n\n      III. It is apparent from the record in this case, including the\n      detailed plan for the operation of the St. Martin Parish public\n      schools, and we so find and accordingly decree that the above named\n      defendants have previously achieved a unitary school system and\n      have operated as such for a period in excess of three (3) years prior\n      to this date; accordingly, all detailed regulatory injunctions\n      heretofore entered by this Court against said defendants are hereby\n      dissolved.\n      IV. Said defendants are hereby permanently enjoined from\n      operating a dual public school system in the Parish of St. Martin,\n      and from adopting any regulatory policies, practices or performing\n      any acts in regard to said public school system in any aspect of its\n      operations which are discriminatory as to any members of the\n      student population, faculty or staff, or any of its employees, or which\n      would deny any benefits to any of said persons or classes of persons,\n      or others affected by said action, on grounds of race, religion, color\n      or national origin.\n      V. To insure compliance with the permanent injunction above set\n      forth, defendants and their successors in office shall: (1) file with\n      this Court on or before November 15, 1975 and November 15, 1976,\n      the statistical data required by the “Hinds County Report,” fully\n      detailed in United States v. Hinds County School Board, 433 F.2d\n      618-19, Appendix B (5 Cir. 1970) [sic], with copies to all counsel of\n      record, and (2) they shall henceforth comply with all regulations of\n      the Department of Health, Education and Welfare [and, in short, all\n      applicable laws].\n      VI. This Court retains jurisdiction of this cause for a period of two\n      years from this date. The matter shall be placed on the inactive\n      docket of this Court, subject to being reopened on proper application\n      by any party made within said period, or on the Court’s own motion\n      should it appear that further proceedings are necessary.\nThis was the last order entered in the case prior to 2009.\n      In 2009, the chief judge of the District Court for the Western District of\nLouisiana noted sua sponte that the case remained on the court’s inactive docket\nand assigned the case for further proceedings. In April 2010, the judge to which\nthe case was assigned observed that jurisdiction appeared to have lapsed in 1976\nbut invited the parties to notify the court if they disagreed with that conclusion.\n\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 12-30850            Document: 00512674560        Page: 4     Date Filed: 06/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                          No. 12-30850\n\n       Plaintiffs and the United States Department of Justice filed responses,\narguing that the 1974 order had not divested the court of jurisdiction as of 1976.\nPlaintiffs also filed a motion to substitute named plaintiffs. The School Board\nfiled two motions to dismiss, both of which argued that the 1974 Order was a\nfinal judgment that dismissed the case.\n       After a hearing, the district court issued a memorandum order denying\nboth motions.1 The court reasoned that the characterization of the order was a\nbasic issue of subject matter jurisdiction. It held that “the [1974 Order] is not\nsufficiently precise to constitute a final judgment finding that the school board\nhas remedied the vestiges of past segregation to the extent practical” and,\naccordingly, that the “suit remains alive.” The court therefore denied the\nmotions to dismiss. This appeal followed.\n                                                 II\n       As an initial matter, we must consider our appellate jurisdiction. The\nSchool Board has appealed the district court’s denial of its motions to dismiss,\nwhich ordinarily does not constitute an immediately appealable order.2 The\nSchool Board contends that appellate jurisdiction lies either under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1291, which grants appellate jurisdiction over “final decisions” of the district\ncourt,3 or under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), which grants appellate jurisdiction over\ncertain interlocutory orders related to injunctions.4                      We conclude that\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         In a separate order, the district court administratively denied the plaintiffs’ motion\nto substitute named plaintiffs pending its resolution of the jurisdiction issue. The docket\nreflects that the district court has not revisited this order. No substitution of plaintiffs has\nyet occurred in the case.\n       2\n           See, e.g., Newball v. Offshore Logistics Int’l, 803 F.2d 821, 824 (5th Cir. 1986).\n       3\n           28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n       4\n           Id. § 1292(a)(1).\n\n                                                 4\n\f     Case: 12-30850        Document: 00512674560          Page: 5     Date Filed: 06/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                        No. 12-30850\n\njurisdiction lies under § 1292(a)(1) and do not consider whether appellate\njurisdiction would otherwise lie under § 1291.\n        Section 1292(a)(1) provides that courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction\nover,\n        [i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the United States, the\n        United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone, the\n        District Court of Guam, and the District Court of the Virgin Islands,\n        or of the judges thereof, granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or\n        dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions,\n        except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court. . . .5\nThis provision applies to orders that explicitly grant, continue, modify, refuse,\nor dissolve injunctions or that refuse to dissolve or modify injunctions, as well\nas to those that have the practical effect of doing so.6 In the latter circumstance,\nhowever, appellate jurisdiction will lie only if the district court’s order “might\nhave a ‘serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence,’ and . . . can be ‘effectually\nchallenged’ only by immediate appeal.”7\n        In this case, we conclude that although the district court’s order did not\nexplicitly refuse to dissolve an injunction, it had the practical effect of doing so.\nIn the district court, the School Board contended that the 1974 Order was a final\norder that dismissed the case. Although the School Board did not express it in\n\n\n\n        5\n            Id.\n        6\n        E.g., Carson v. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981); Hatten-Gonzales v. Hyde, 579\nF.3d 1159, 1167 (10th Cir. 2009); McCoy v. La. State Bd. of Educ., 345 F.2d 720, 721 (5th Cir.\n1965) (per curiam) (citing Ettelson v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 317 U.S. 188 (1942)).\n        7\n         Carson, 450 U.S. at 84 (quoting Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger, 348 U.S. 176,\n181 (1955)); accord McLaughlin v. Miss. Power Co., 376 F.3d 344, 352 (5th Cir. 2004) (“[A]fter\nGardner, ‘orders which . . . have the practical effect of denying an injunction, but do not do so\nin explicit terms, are immediately appealable if the order threatens serious, perhaps\nirreparable consequences and can be effectively challenged only by immediate appeal.’” (second\nalteration in original) (quoting Sherri A.D. v. Kirby, 975 F.2d 193, 203 (5th Cir. 1992)));\nRoberts v. St. Regis Paper Co., 653 F.2d 166, 170 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (applying Carson in\na case involving refusal to dissolve an injunction).\n\n                                               5\n\f     Case: 12-30850         Document: 00512674560         Page: 6     Date Filed: 06/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                         No. 12-30850\n\nso many words, the School Board implicitly argued that the injunction in the\n1974 Order was—and, in any event, should be—dissolved. By holding that the\n1974 Order was not a final order that dismissed the case, the district court’s\ndenial of the motions to dismiss had the practical effect of refusing to dissolve\nthe 1974 Order’s permanent injunction.8 Given the peculiar circumstances of\nthis nearly fifty-year-old case, the district court’s refusal also may have serious,\nperhaps irreparable consequences for the School Board and can be effectually\nchallenged only by immediate appeal. Accordingly, we hold that appellate\njurisdiction lies under § 1292(a)(1).\n                                               III\n       We now turn to the issue of the district court’s jurisdiction. As the district\ncourt correctly recognized, if the 1974 Order held that the School Board had met\nits constitutional mandate to eliminate all vestiges of discrimination and\ndismissed the case, then the district court would be without jurisdiction to\nconsider any new matters in the case.9 If not, then the case remains live.10\n       Our analysis is governed by the Supreme Court’s decision in Board of\nEducation of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell,11 which dealt with a\nsimilar issue to that posed by this case. In Dowell the district court entered an\norder in 1977 titled “Order Terminating Case,” which provided as follows:\n       The Court has concluded that [the desegregation plan] worked . . . .\n       The School Board, under the oversight of the Court, has operated\n       the Plan properly, and the Court does not foresee that the\n\n\n       8\n        See Roberts, 653 F.2d at 170 (“[D]efendants contended that all provisions of the decree\nhad expired; in essence, they asked the court to dissolve the injunction. In holding that the\ndecree continues to be viable, the court’s order had the practical effect of refusing to dissolve\nthe injunction.”).\n       9\n           See Lee v. Macon Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 584 F.2d 78, 81-82 (5th Cir. 1978).\n       10\n            See id.\n       11\n            498 U.S. 237 (1991).\n\n                                                6\n\f    Case: 12-30850         Document: 00512674560          Page: 7    Date Filed: 06/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                         No. 12-30850\n\n      termination of its jurisdiction will result in the dismantlement of\n      the Plan or any affirmative action by the defendant to undermine\n      the unitary system so slowly and painfully accomplished over the 16\n      years during which the cause has been pending before this\n      court . . . .\n      The School Board, as now constituted, has manifested the desire\n      and intent to follow the law. The court believes that the present\n      members and their successors will now and in the future continue\n      to follow the constitutional desegregation requirements.\n      Now sensitized to the constitutional implications of its conduct and\n      with a new awareness of its responsibility to citizens of all races, the\n      Board is entitled to pursue in good faith its legitimate policies\n      without the continuing constitutional supervision of this Court . . . .\n      Jurisdiction in this case is terminated ipso facto subject only to final\n      disposition of any case now pending on appeal.12\n      The Supreme Court first observed that the order did not dissolve the\ndesegregation decree. The Court then explained that, because courts in the\n1970s had been inconsistent in their use of the term “unitary,” it could not take\nthe order’s reference to the board’s achievement of a “unitary system” to mean\nthat the school board had met its constitutional obligations. Some courts “used\n[the term] to identify a school district that has completely remedied all vestiges\nof past discrimination,” which would mean that the district had met the mandate\nof Brown v. Board of Education13 and its progeny.14 Other courts, however, used\nthe term “to describe any school district that has currently desegregated student\nassignments, whether or not that status is solely the result of a court-imposed\n\n\n\n\n      12\n           Dowell, 498 U.S. at 241-42.\n      13\n           349 U.S. 294 (1955).\n      14\n           Dowell, 498 U.S. at 245 (citing Brown, 349 U.S. 294) (collecting cases).\n\n                                               7\n\f    Case: 12-30850           Document: 00512674560         Page: 8     Date Filed: 06/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                          No. 12-30850\n\ndesegregation plan.”15 Under the latter usage, “a school district could be called\nunitary and nevertheless still contain vestiges of past discrimination.”16\n        In light of this ambiguity, the Court determined that the order was\n“unclear with respect to what it meant by unitary and the necessary result of\nthat finding.”17 The Court therefore upheld the court of appeals’ conclusion that\n“while the 1977 order . . . did bind the parties as to the unitary character of the\ndistrict, it did not finally terminate the . . . litigation.”18 In this regard, the Court\nobserved “that a school board is entitled to a rather precise statement of its\nobligations under a desegregation decree,” and “[i]f such a decree is to be\nterminated or dissolved, [plaintiffs] as well as the school board are entitled to a\nlike statement from the court.”19 Notably, the Court came to this conclusion\nnotwithstanding the 1977 order’s seemingly clear intention to terminate the\ncase.\n        The decision in Dowell mandates the conclusion that the unitariness\nfinding in the 1974 Order is ambiguous and, therefore, that the 1974 Order did\nnot dismiss this case. The 1974 Order states that “[i]t is apparent from the\nrecord in this case, including the detailed [desegregation] plan for the operation\nof the St. Martin Parish public schools, and we so find and accordingly decree\nthat the above named defendants have previously achieved a unitary school\nsystem and have operated as such for a period in excess of three (3) years prior\nto this date.” As in Dowell, the meaning of this declaration is unclear.

However, in Dowell, the Supreme Court\nconcluded that an order expressly terminating jurisdiction is not by itself\neffective to dismiss a desegregation case, nor does it transform an ambiguous\nfinding of unitariness into an unambiguous one.21 The cases cited by the School\nBoard, each of which involved an order explicitly dismissing the case,22 are not\nto the contrary.\n         At oral argument, the School Board sought to distinguish Dowell by noting\nthat the order in Dowell did not refer explicitly to any injunctions while the 1974\nOrder expressly dissolved “all detailed regulatory injunctions” entered against\nthe Board.           We are not persuaded.            Dissolving “all detailed regulatory\ninjunctions” does not qualify as a “rather precise statement” of the School\nBoard’s ongoing obligations. The 1974 Order also explicitly and implicitly refers\nto the continuing existence of an injunction mandating conduct on the part of the\n\n         20\n              See United States v.

The 1974 Order imposed a permanent injunction barring the\nSchool Board from returning to a segregated system and from adopting any\ndiscriminatory policies or practices or performing discriminatory acts with\nrespect to any aspect of its operations. Paragraph two of the 1974 Order, which\nheld that the personnel policy adopted by the School Board could “be continued\nin operation, subject to the conditions imposed upon defendants with regard to\nthe future operations of the public school system of St. Martin Parish,” also\nsuggests that the School Board remained subject to affirmative obligations. The\n1974 Order’s inclusion of these provisions would have been anomalous if it had\nfound that the School Board had reached unitary status in the sense of\neliminating all vestiges of past discrimination.23\n       Although in the absence of Dowell we may have been inclined to hold that\nthe 1974 Order was a final order that dismissed the case, Dowell requires the\nconclusion that the 1974 Order is ambiguous. We accordingly affirm the district\ncourt’s order denying the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction and remand\nfor further proceedings.\n       We are confident that on remand, the district court will hew closely to the\nother facets of Dowell’s holding. The Supreme Court held that decrees in school\n\n\n       23\n          See, e.g., Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248 (“The legal justification for displacement of local\nauthority by an injunctive decree in a school desegregation case is a violation of the\nConstitution by the local authorities.”); Monteilh v. St. Landry Parish Sch. Bd., 848 F.2d 625,\n629 (5th Cir. 1988) (observing, in holding that a 1971 declaration of that the district was\n“unitary in its entirety” was not a final declaration on that subject, that declaration’s\n“retention of jurisdiction would have been anomalous” if the district court actually had\ndeclared that the district had reached unitary status); Lee v. Macon Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 584\nF.2d 78, 81-82 (5th Cir. 1978) (“[T]he District Court entered its order on February 10, 1977,\nfinding the . . . the school system to be unitary in nature. . . .

The inquiry is “whether the vestiges of de jure segregation had been\neliminated as far as practicable.”27 As our court has recently affirmed, “‘[o]nce\nthe racial imbalance . . . due to the de jure violation has been remedied, the\nschool district is under no duty to remedy imbalance that is caused by\ndemographic factors.’”28\n                                       *        *         *\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court\nand REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n       24\n            Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248.\n       25\n        Id.

In 1965, Plaintiffs filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nalleging that the School Board was operating a segregated school system (a “dual\nsystem”) and seeking injunctive relief. In September 1965, the presiding judge,\nJudge Richard Putnam, found that the School Board had engaged in intentional\ndiscrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment and ordered the immediate desegregation of all grades in the School\nBoard’s system. At the same time, the court approved the initial plan of\ndesegregation proposed by the School Board.\n      In July 1969, the School Board proposed a new plan of desegregation. The\ndistrict court approved the plan at that time and issued an amended judgment\nregarding the desegregation plan in December 1971. Over the next several\nyears, the district court received regular reports from the School Board reporting\nthe status of its desegregation effort, approved certain changes to the\ndesegregation plan requested by the parties, and made various other rulings.\n      In July 1974, Judge Putnam issued an order directing the parties to file\nbriefs on several issues, including “[w]hether or not this school system has\nachieved a unitary status, has maintained such status for a period of two years,\nand the decree of th[e] Court should be dissolved” as of that time. The decree\nthat followed—the 1974 Order—stated, in pertinent part, as follows:\n      II. The objective criteria filed by the Board and set out in the\n      Board’s Policy Manual for Hiring and Promoting of faculty and staff\n      members within and for said system may be continued in operation,\n      subject to the conditions imposed upon defendants with regard to\n      the future operations of the public school system . . . , and reserving\n      to all parties the right to raise this issue within the two year period\n      hereinafter stated in paragraph VI.\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f    Case: 12-30850     Document: 00512674560      Page: 3    Date Filed: 06/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-30850\n\n      III. It is apparent from the record in this case, including the\n      detailed plan for the operation of the St. Martin Parish public\n      schools, and we so find and accordingly decree that the above named\n      defendants have previously achieved a unitary school system and\n      have operated as such for a period in excess of three (3) years prior\n      to this date; accordingly, all detailed regulatory injunctions\n      heretofore entered by this Court against said defendants are hereby\n      dissolved.\n      IV. Said defendants are hereby permanently enjoined from\n      operating a dual public school system in the Parish of St. Martin,\n      and from adopting any regulatory policies, practices or performing\n      any acts in regard to said public school system in any aspect of its\n      operations which are discriminatory as to any members of the\n      student population, faculty or staff, or any of its employees, or which\n      would deny any benefits to any of said persons or classes of persons,\n      or others affected by said action, on grounds of race, religion, color\n      or national origin.\n      V. To insure compliance with the permanent injunction above set\n      forth, defendants and their successors in office shall: (1) file with\n      this Court on or before November 15, 1975 and November 15, 1976,\n      the statistical data required by the “Hinds County Report,” fully\n      detailed in United States v. Hinds County School Board, 433 F.2d\n      618-19, Appendix B (5 Cir. 1970) [sic], with copies to all counsel of\n      record, and (2) they shall henceforth comply with all regulations of\n      the Department of Health, Education and Welfare [and, in short, all\n      applicable laws].\n      VI. This Court retains jurisdiction of this cause for a period of two\n      years from this date. The matter shall be placed on the inactive\n      docket of this Court, subject to being reopened on proper application\n      by any party made within said period, or on the Court’s own motion\n      should it appear that further proceedings are necessary.\nThis was the last order entered in the case prior to 2009.\n      In 2009, the chief judge of the District Court for the Western District of\nLouisiana noted sua sponte that the case remained on the court’s inactive docket\nand assigned the case for further proceedings. In April 2010, the judge to which\nthe case was assigned observed that jurisdiction appeared to have lapsed in 1976\nbut invited the parties to notify the court if they disagreed with that conclusion.\n\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 12-30850            Document: 00512674560        Page: 4     Date Filed: 06/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                          No. 12-30850\n\n       Plaintiffs and the United States Department of Justice filed responses,\narguing that the 1974 order had not divested the court of jurisdiction as of 1976.\nPlaintiffs also filed a motion to substitute named plaintiffs. The School Board\nfiled two motions to dismiss, both of which argued that the 1974 Order was a\nfinal judgment that dismissed the case.\n       After a hearing, the district court issued a memorandum order denying\nboth motions.1 The court reasoned that the characterization of the order was a\nbasic issue of subject matter jurisdiction. It held that “the [1974 Order] is not\nsufficiently precise to constitute a final judgment finding that the school board\nhas remedied the vestiges of past segregation to the extent practical” and,\naccordingly, that the “suit remains alive.” The court therefore denied the\nmotions to dismiss. This appeal followed.\n                                                 II\n       As an initial matter, we must consider our appellate jurisdiction. The\nSchool Board has appealed the district court’s denial of its motions to dismiss,\nwhich ordinarily does not constitute an immediately appealable order.2 The\nSchool Board contends that appellate jurisdiction lies either under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1291, which grants appellate jurisdiction over “final decisions” of the district\ncourt,3 or under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), which grants appellate jurisdiction over\ncertain interlocutory orders related to injunctions.4                      We conclude that\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         In a separate order, the district court administratively denied the plaintiffs’ motion\nto substitute named plaintiffs pending its resolution of the jurisdiction issue. The docket\nreflects that the district court has not revisited this order. No substitution of plaintiffs has\nyet occurred in the case.\n       2\n           See, e.g., Newball v.

Unit B 1981) (applying Carson in\na case involving refusal to dissolve an injunction).\n\n                                               5\n\f     Case: 12-30850         Document: 00512674560         Page: 6     Date Filed: 06/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                         No. 12-30850\n\nso many words, the School Board implicitly argued that the injunction in the\n1974 Order was—and, in any event, should be—dissolved. By holding that the\n1974 Order was not a final order that dismissed the case, the district court’s\ndenial of the motions to dismiss had the practical effect of refusing to dissolve\nthe 1974 Order’s permanent injunction.8 Given the peculiar circumstances of\nthis nearly fifty-year-old case, the district court’s refusal also may have serious,\nperhaps irreparable consequences for the School Board and can be effectually\nchallenged only by immediate appeal. Accordingly, we hold that appellate\njurisdiction lies under § 1292(a)(1).\n                                               III\n       We now turn to the issue of the district court’s jurisdiction. As the district\ncourt correctly recognized, if the 1974 Order held that the School Board had met\nits constitutional mandate to eliminate all vestiges of discrimination and\ndismissed the case, then the district court would be without jurisdiction to\nconsider any new matters in the case.9 If not, then the case remains live.10\n       Our analysis is governed by the Supreme Court’s decision in Board of\nEducation of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell,11 which dealt with a\nsimilar issue to that posed by this case. In Dowell the district court entered an\norder in 1977 titled “Order Terminating Case,” which provided as follows:\n       The Court has concluded that [the desegregation plan] worked . . . .\n       The School Board, under the oversight of the Court, has operated\n       the Plan properly, and the Court does not foresee that the\n\n\n       8\n        See Roberts, 653 F.2d at 170 (“[D]efendants contended that all provisions of the decree\nhad expired; in essence, they asked the court to dissolve the injunction.

The Court then explained that, because courts in the\n1970s had been inconsistent in their use of the term “unitary,” it could not take\nthe order’s reference to the board’s achievement of a “unitary system” to mean\nthat the school board had met its constitutional obligations. Some courts “used\n[the term] to identify a school district that has completely remedied all vestiges\nof past discrimination,” which would mean that the district had met the mandate\nof Brown v. Board of Education13 and its progeny.14 Other courts, however, used\nthe term “to describe any school district that has currently desegregated student\nassignments, whether or not that status is solely the result of a court-imposed\n\n\n\n\n      12\n           Dowell, 498 U.S. at 241-42.\n      13\n           </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1955).\n      14\n           Dowell, 498 U.S. at 245 (citing Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">) (collecting cases).\n\n                                               7\n\f    Case: 12-30850           Document: 00512674560         Page: 8     Date Filed: 06/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                          No. 12-30850\n\ndesegregation plan.”15 Under the latter usage, “a school district could be called\nunitary and nevertheless still contain vestiges of past discrimination.”16\n        In light of this ambiguity, the Court determined that the order was\n“unclear with respect to what it meant by unitary and the necessary result of\nthat finding.”17 The Court therefore upheld the court of appeals’ conclusion that\n“while the 1977 order . . . did bind the parties as to the unitary character of the\ndistrict, it did not finally terminate the . . . litigation.”18 In this regard, the Court\nobserved “that a school board is entitled to a rather precise statement of its\nobligations under a desegregation decree,” and “[i]f such a decree is to be\nterminated or dissolved, [plaintiffs] as well as the school board are entitled to a\nlike statement from the court.”19 Notably, the Court came to this conclusion\nnotwithstanding the 1977 order’s seemingly clear intention to terminate the\ncase.\n        The decision in Dowell mandates the conclusion that the unitariness\nfinding in the 1974 Order is ambiguous and, therefore, that the 1974 Order did\nnot dismiss this case. The 1974 Order states that “[i]t is apparent from the\nrecord in this case, including the detailed [desegregation] plan for the operation\nof the St. Martin Parish public schools, and we so find and accordingly decree\nthat the above named defendants have previously achieved a unitary school\nsystem and have operated as such for a period in excess of three (3) years prior\nto this date.” As in Dowell, the meaning of this declaration is unclear.

However, in Dowell, the Supreme Court\nconcluded that an order expressly terminating jurisdiction is not by itself\neffective to dismiss a desegregation case, nor does it transform an ambiguous\nfinding of unitariness into an unambiguous one.21 The cases cited by the School\nBoard, each of which involved an order explicitly dismissing the case,22 are not\nto the contrary.\n         At oral argument, the School Board sought to distinguish Dowell by noting\nthat the order in Dowell did not refer explicitly to any injunctions while the 1974\nOrder expressly dissolved “all detailed regulatory injunctions” entered against\nthe Board.           We are not persuaded.            Dissolving “all detailed regulatory\ninjunctions” does not qualify as a “rather precise statement” of the School\nBoard’s ongoing obligations.

The 1974 Order imposed a permanent injunction barring the\nSchool Board from returning to a segregated system and from adopting any\ndiscriminatory policies or practices or performing discriminatory acts with\nrespect to any aspect of its operations. Paragraph two of the 1974 Order, which\nheld that the personnel policy adopted by the School Board could “be continued\nin operation, subject to the conditions imposed upon defendants with regard to\nthe future operations of the public school system of St. Martin Parish,” also\nsuggests that the School Board remained subject to affirmative obligations.
