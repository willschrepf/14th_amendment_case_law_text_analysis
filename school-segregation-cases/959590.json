The court\ngenerally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order\nand judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f      After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\n\nunanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of\n\nthis appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is\n\ntherefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\n      Plaintiff Robert DeSpain appeals the district court’s dismissal of his\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\n\ngranted. The district court defined plaintiff’s issues as: (1) denial of freedom of\n\nreligion; (2) denial of access to courts; (3) substantive and procedural due process\n\nviolations; and (4) cruel and unusual punishment. He also asserted state law\n\nclaims of libel and slander. The district court dismissed all of plaintiff’s civil\n\nrights claims for failure to state a cause of action and declined to exercise pendent\n\nor supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims.\n\n      On appeal, plaintiff limits his challenge to two issues: (1) whether the\n\ndistrict court erred in dismissing his complaint prior to service and response by\n\ndefendants without affording him an opportunity to amend his complaint, and (2)\n\nwhether the district court erred in dismissing his complaint that he was subjected\n\nto atypical conditions of punitive confinement in retaliation for instituting a\n\nlawsuit. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we reverse and\n\nremand the case for further proceedings.\n\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n                                          -3-\n\f      In his initial complaint, filed on December 1, 1997, plaintiff asserted claims\n\narising from a lock-down ordered after the murder of a guard by three prisoners in\n\nthe Wyoming State Penitentiary in June 1997. Plaintiff claimed that during the\n\nlock-down, he was denied outdoor or indoor recreation, religious materials, access\n\nto legal assistance, and appropriate medical care. He asserted that his personal\n\nproperty was confiscated “in a ‘mass’ property reform act by the Dept. of\n\nCorrections.” R. Doc. 1 at 6. In addition, he alleged an Eighth Amendment cruel\n\nand unusual punishment claim arising out of a two-day placement in an isolation\n\ncell on September 23, 1997. His amended complaint included similar claims\n\narising from a five-day placement in an isolation cell on December 22, 1997. The\n\ndistrict court dismissed all of plaintiff’s contentions for failure to state a claim,\n\nbut it is only the latter two incidents of isolated confinement that form the basis\n\nfor his claims on appeal.\n\n      Petitioner alleged that during his September 1997 incident of isolation he\n\nwas placed on “‘Red Tag’ status” and denied a mattress, bedding, and hygiene\n\nitems. He claims he was left in his boxer shorts in an unheated “strip cell” for\n\nseventy-two hours with the outdoor temperature ranging between thirty to forty\n\ndegrees. R. Doc. 1 at 11. He stated that the temperature in the cell was cold and\n\nhe “walked for hours” and “would wrap up [his] torso with toilet paper trying to\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fstay warm.” Id. at 11-12. He alleged he was given no explanation for this\n\npunitive action.\n\n       During his December 1997 five-day placement in isolation, plaintiff alleged\n\nhe was handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell where, for a three-day period, he\n\nwas housed without hygiene items, a mattress, or any bedding except for a\n\n“suicide” blanket and toilet paper.   Id. Doc. 24 at 17. He was eventually allowed\n\nto have a shower and given a mattress. The prisoner in the isolation cell next to\n\nplaintiff, Abdullah Amin, inquired of a guard, Officer Pacheco, as to why they\n\nwere in isolation. Plaintiff claims that Officer Pacheco responded that Amin was\n\nin isolation for assaulting guards and plaintiff was in isolation for “being a\n\ndickhead and because [plaintiff] was suing him.”     1\n                                                          Id. at 19.\n\n       On December 27, 1997, after five days in isolation, plaintiff was advised\n\nthat he was being charged with various rule violations including sexual assault,\n\nfondling, and issuing threats. He had three hearings on these charges, but was not\n\nallowed to be present for two of the hearings because he was disruptive. He was\n\nconvicted of five major rule violations and one general rule violation and\n\nsentenced to fifty-four months in punitive segregation.       2\n\n\n\n\n1\n     Officer Pacheco was named as a defendant in plaintiff’s original and\namended complaints.\n2\n      Plaintiff was released back into the general population on November 17,\n1999, after approximately twenty-three months in segregation.\n\n                                            -5-\n\f                                     II. Discussion\n\n       Title 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) requires the court to dismiss an in forma\n\npauperis case if, at any time, it determines that the case “fails to state a claim on\n\nwhich relief may be granted.” Section 1915A(a) requires the court to “review,\n\nbefore docketing . . . or . . . as soon as practicable after docketing” all civil\n\ncomplaints “in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or\n\nofficer or employee of a governmental entity.” The court then must dismiss the\n\ncomplaint if it “fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.”\n\n§ 1915A(b)(1). Further, a district court may always dismiss a claim sua sponte\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) “when it is patently obvious that the plaintiff could\n\nnot prevail on the facts alleged, and allowing him an opportunity to amend his\n\ncomplaint would be futile.”     McKinney v. Oklahoma Dep’t of Human Servs         ., 925\n\nF.2d 363, 365 (10th Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\nAlthough it is unclear whether the district court based its dismissal of plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint on Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), or 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915A(b)(1), our disposition of this case would be the same regardless of the\n\nbasis invoked.\n\n       This court reviews de novo an order dismissing a prisoner’s case for failure\n\nto state a claim.   See Hunt v. Uphoff,   199 F.3d 1220, 1223 (10th Cir. 1999);     see\n\nalso Perkins v. Kansas Dep’t of Corrections       , 165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir. 1999)\n\n                                            -6-\n\f(establishing the de novo standard of review for a dismissal under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim);   Sutton v. Utah State Sch. for the\n\nDeaf & Blind , 173 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10th Cir. 1999) (stating that a de novo\n\nstandard of review is applicable to a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal).\n\n       Dismissal for failure to state a claim is proper only where, after accepting\n\nall factual allegations as true, the “‘plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support\n\nof his claims that would entitle him to relief.’”    Leonhardt v. Western Sugar Co .,\n\n160 F.3d 631, 634 (10th Cir. 1998) (     quoting Dill v. City of Edmond , 155 F.3d\n\n1193, 1201 (10th Cir. 1998)). We liberally construe a pro se litigant’s pleadings,\n\nbut this “does not relieve the plaintiff of the burden of alleging sufficient facts on\n\nwhich a recognized legal claim could be based.”       Hall v. Bellmon , 935 F.2d 1106,\n\n1110 (10th Cir. 1991). However, an in forma pauperis complaint may not be\n\ndismissed merely because a court finds the “allegations unlikely.”      Denton v.\n\nHernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 33 (1992). Thus, the question before this court on\n\nappeal is whether plaintiff’s complaint and amended complaint alleged sufficient\n\nfacts to support a legal claim.\n\n                 A. Cruel and Unusual Conditions of Confinement\n\n       The Eighth Amendment, applicable to the states through the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, “prohibits the infliction of ‘cruel and\n\nunusual punishment’ on those convicted of crimes.”         See Wilson v. Seiter , 501\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\fU.S. 294, 297 (1991). The Eighth Amendment requires jail officials “to provide\n\nhumane conditions of confinement by ensuring inmates receive the basic\n\nnecessities of adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care and by taking\n\nreasonable measures to guarantee the inmates’ safety.”       Barney v. Pulsipher , 143\n\nF.3d 1299, 1310 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\n       To hold a prison official personally liable for violating an inmate’s right to\n\nhumane conditions of confinement, a plaintiff must satisfy two requirements,\n\nconsisting of an objective and subjective component.       See id . The objective\n\ncomponent requires that the alleged deprivation be “sufficiently serious.”     Wilson ,\n\n501 U.S. at 298. Jail conditions may be “‘restrictive and even harsh’” without\n\nviolating constitutional rights.   Barney , 143 F.3d at 1311 ( quoting Rhodes v.\n\nChapman , 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981)). Indeed, “only those deprivations denying\n\nthe minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities . . . are sufficiently grave to\n\nform the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation.”        Wilson , 501 U.S. at 298\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted);    accord Farmer v. Brennan , 511\n\nU.S. 825 (1994).\n\n       This inquiry turns not only on the severity of the alleged deprivations, but\n\nalso on their duration.   See Barney , 143 F.3d at 1311 (“An important factor in\n\ndetermining whether the conditions of confinement meet constitutional standards\n\nis the length of the incarceration.”). Additionally, when, as in this case, a claim\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\finvolves a number of inhumane confinement conditions, the court must bear in\n\nmind that:\n\n       Some conditions of confinement may establish an Eighth Amendment\n       violation “in combination” when each would not do so alone, but\n       only when they have a mutually enforcing effect that produces the\n       deprivation of a single, identifiable human need such as food,\n       warmth, or exercise--for example, a low cell temperature at night\n       combined with a failure to issue blankets. . . . Nothing so amorphous\n       as “overall conditions” can rise to the level of cruel and unusual\n       punishment when no specific deprivation of a single human need\n       exists.\n\nWilson , 501 U.S. at 304-05 (citations omitted);        accord Mitchell v. Maynard , 80\n\nF.3d 1433, 1442 (10th Cir. 1996) (citing cases where deprivation of human needs\n\nfound to be Eighth Amendment violation).\n\n       The subjective component requires the jail official to have a “sufficiently\n\nculpable state of mind.”   Wilson , 501 U.S. at 297. In the context of\n\nprison-conditions claims, the required state of mind is one of “‘deliberate\n\nindifference’ to inmate health and safety.”         Farmer , 511 U.S. at 834 ( quoting\n\nWilson , 501 U.S. at 302-03). In other words, a prison official is liable only if he\n\nor she “knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health and safety; the\n\nofficial must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that\n\na substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.”\n\nId. at 837. “It is not enough to establish that the official should have known of\n\nthe risk of harm.”   Barney , 143 F.3d at 1310.\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\f      Here, plaintiff’s allegations that on two separate occasions he was placed in\n\nisolation without clothes, a mattress, or bedding, and without any means to keep\n\nwarm support his conditions of confinement claim sufficiently to withstand sua\n\nsponte dismissal.   See Wilson , 501 U.S. at 304-05 (defining warmth as an\n\n“identifiable human need,” the deprivation of which may constitute an Eighth\n\nAmendment violation).     In a case with similar facts to those alleged by plaintiff,\n\nthis court reversed the district court’s grant of judgment as a matter of law on the\n\nappellant’s claim of cruel and unusual punishment where the appellant had been\n\n      stripped of his clothing, placed in a concrete cell, with no heat at a\n      time when nighttime temperatures hovered in the mid-fifties,\n      provided no mattress, blankets or bedding of any kind, deprived of\n      his prescription eyeglasses, not allowed to leave his cell for exercise,\n      not provided with writing utensils, not provided with adequate\n      ventilation, not provided with hot water, and only sometimes allowed\n      minimal amounts of toilet paper.\n\nMitchell , 80 F.3d at 1442. The Mitchell court concluded that these conditions\n\n“could constitute a violation of [plaintiff’s] right to be free of cruel and unusual\n\npunishments.”   Id. at 1443.\n\n      Although the court on remand will have to determine whether the relatively\n\nshort duration of the deprivation ameliorates the violation, we conclude that\n\nplaintiff has stated a claim of cruel and unusual conditions of confinement\n\nsufficient to withstand summary dismissal.\n\n                                    B. Retaliation\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\f       Even though incarcerated, plaintiff retains fundamental constitutional\n\nrights. See Wolff v. McDonnell , 418 U.S. 539, 555 (1974). This court has “held\n\nthat prison officials may not retaliate against or harass an inmate because of the\n\ninmate’s exercise of his constitutional rights.”      Peterson v. Shanks , 149 F.3d\n\n1140, 1144 (10th Cir. 1998) (quotations omitted). “This principle applies even\n\nwhere the action taken in retaliation would be otherwise permissible.”              Id.\n\n(quotation omitted).\n\n       Here, plaintiff alleged that the harsh disciplinary treatment he received in\n\nisolation was in retaliation for filing his original complaint. Prisoners have a\n\nconstitutional right of access to the courts, and may therefore assert § 1983 claims\n\nalleging that prison officials retaliated against them for exercising that right.         See\n\nSmith v. Maschner , 899 F.2d 940, 947 (10th Cir. 1990) (holding that “[t]he\n\nexistence of an improper motive for disciplining a prisoner which results in\n\ninterference with a constitutional right” gives rise to a cause of action under §\n\n1983). To withstand dismissal, however, plaintiff must plead facts evincing a\n\nretaliatory motive.   See Frazier v. Dubois , 922 F.2d 560, 562 n.1 (10th Cir. 1990).\n\n        “[B]ecause the ultimate fact of retaliation turns on defendant’s state of\n\nmind, it is particularly difficult to establish by direct evidence.”       Smith , 899 F.2d\n\nat 949. As in Smith , a claim of such retaliation may be established by “the only\n\n\n\n\n                                              -11-\n\fmeans available . . . circumstantial evidence.”       Id. at 949. Here, we believe\n\nplaintiff’s complaint alleged such circumstantial evidence.\n\n       Plaintiff asserted that he was placed in segregation without notice of the\n\ncharges against him and without a hearing.         See Hughes v. Rowe , 449 U.S. 5, 11\n\n(1980) (noting that if the purpose of segregation is punishment, “[s]egregation of\n\na prisoner without a prior hearing may violate due process if the postponement of\n\nprocedural protections is not justified by apprehended emergency conditions.”).\n\nAccepting plaintiff’s statements as true,    see Leonhardt , 160 F.3d at 634, it is\n\napparent that the conditions in plaintiff’s isolation cell were punitive. Moreover,\n\nthere is obviously “temporal proximity” between the filing of plaintiff’s original\n\ncomplaint on December 1, 1997, and his placement in isolation on December 22,\n\n1997. Smith , 899 F.2d at 948. Plaintiff asserts that when Amin questioned\n\nOfficer Pacheco as to the reason for their segregation, Officer Pacheco responded\n\nthat plaintiff was there for filing suit.\n\n       Therefore, insofar as plaintiff is asserting that he was placed into punitive\n\nsegregation in retaliation for exercising his constitutional rights in filing a civil\n\nrights action against defendants, plaintiff states a cause of action. In concluding\n\nthat plaintiff has sufficiently supported his allegations of retaliation, we are not,\n\nhowever, suggesting that a reasonable fact finder would necessarily find in his\n\nfavor. Rather, we are only concluding that on the facts and evidence provided,\n\n\n                                            -12-\n\fsummary dismissal of plaintiff’s retaliation claim was improper.      See Frazier ,\n\n922 F.2d at 562 (“Because [plaintiff] may be able to prove that his transfer was a\n\nresult of improper retaliation by prison officials to punish plaintiff for\n\nconstitutionally protected activity,” dismissal as frivolous under § 1915(d) was\n\nimproper); cf. Smith , 899 F.2d at 947-49 (discussing evidentiary showing on\n\nclaim of retaliation sufficient to survive summary judgment).\n\n                                    C. Leave to Amend\n\n       Finally, plaintiff asserts that the district court erred in dismissing his\n\ncomplaint without affording him leave to amend. Whether to allow amendment\n\nof a complaint is a matter left to the district court’s discretion.   See Gillette v.\n\nTansy , 17 F.3d 308, 312 (10th Cir. 1994).

See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is\n\ntherefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\n      Plaintiff Robert DeSpain appeals the district court’s dismissal of his\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\n\ngranted. The district court defined plaintiff’s issues as: (1) denial of freedom of\n\nreligion; (2) denial of access to courts; (3) substantive and procedural due process\n\nviolations; and (4) cruel and unusual punishment. He also asserted state law\n\nclaims of libel and slander. The district court dismissed all of plaintiff’s civil\n\nrights claims for failure to state a cause of action and declined to exercise pendent\n\nor supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims.\n\n      On appeal, plaintiff limits his challenge to two issues: (1) whether the\n\ndistrict court erred in dismissing his complaint prior to service and response by\n\ndefendants without affording him an opportunity to amend his complaint, and (2)\n\nwhether the district court erred in dismissing his complaint that he was subjected\n\nto atypical conditions of punitive confinement in retaliation for instituting a\n\nlawsuit. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we reverse and\n\nremand the case for further proceedings.\n\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n                                          -3-\n\f      In his initial complaint, filed on December 1, 1997, plaintiff asserted claims\n\narising from a lock-down ordered after the murder of a guard by three prisoners in\n\nthe Wyoming State Penitentiary in June 1997. Plaintiff claimed that during the\n\nlock-down, he was denied outdoor or indoor recreation, religious materials, access\n\nto legal assistance, and appropriate medical care. He asserted that his personal\n\nproperty was confiscated “in a ‘mass’ property reform act by the Dept. of\n\nCorrections.” R. Doc. 1 at 6. In addition, he alleged an Eighth Amendment cruel\n\nand unusual punishment claim arising out of a two-day placement in an isolation\n\ncell on September 23, 1997. His amended complaint included similar claims\n\narising from a five-day placement in an isolation cell on December 22, 1997. The\n\ndistrict court dismissed all of plaintiff’s contentions for failure to state a claim,\n\nbut it is only the latter two incidents of isolated confinement that form the basis\n\nfor his claims on appeal.\n\n      Petitioner alleged that during his September 1997 incident of isolation he\n\nwas placed on “‘Red Tag’ status” and denied a mattress, bedding, and hygiene\n\nitems. He claims he was left in his boxer shorts in an unheated “strip cell” for\n\nseventy-two hours with the outdoor temperature ranging between thirty to forty\n\ndegrees. R. Doc. 1 at 11. He stated that the temperature in the cell was cold and\n\nhe “walked for hours” and “would wrap up [his] torso with toilet paper trying to\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fstay warm.” Id. at 11-12. He alleged he was given no explanation for this\n\npunitive action.\n\n       During his December 1997 five-day placement in isolation, plaintiff alleged\n\nhe was handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell where, for a three-day period, he\n\nwas housed without hygiene items, a mattress, or any bedding except for a\n\n“suicide” blanket and toilet paper.   Id. Doc. 24 at 17. He was eventually allowed\n\nto have a shower and given a mattress. The prisoner in the isolation cell next to\n\nplaintiff, Abdullah Amin, inquired of a guard, Officer Pacheco, as to why they\n\nwere in isolation. Plaintiff claims that Officer Pacheco responded that Amin was\n\nin isolation for assaulting guards and plaintiff was in isolation for “being a\n\ndickhead and because [plaintiff] was suing him.”     1\n                                                          Id. at 19.\n\n       On December 27, 1997, after five days in isolation, plaintiff was advised\n\nthat he was being charged with various rule violations including sexual assault,\n\nfondling, and issuing threats. He had three hearings on these charges, but was not\n\nallowed to be present for two of the hearings because he was disruptive. He was\n\nconvicted of five major rule violations and one general rule violation and\n\nsentenced to fifty-four months in punitive segregation.       2\n\n\n\n\n1\n     Officer Pacheco was named as a defendant in plaintiff’s original and\namended complaints.\n2\n      Plaintiff was released back into the general population on November 17,\n1999, after approximately twenty-three months in segregation.\n\n                                            -5-\n\f                                     II. Discussion\n\n       Title 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) requires the court to dismiss an in forma\n\npauperis case if, at any time, it determines that the case “fails to state a claim on\n\nwhich relief may be granted.” Section 1915A(a) requires the court to “review,\n\nbefore docketing . . . or . . . as soon as practicable after docketing” all civil\n\ncomplaints “in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or\n\nofficer or employee of a governmental entity.” The court then must dismiss the\n\ncomplaint if it “fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.”\n\n§ 1915A(b)(1). Further, a district court may always dismiss a claim sua sponte\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) “when it is patently obvious that the plaintiff could\n\nnot prevail on the facts alleged, and allowing him an opportunity to amend his\n\ncomplaint would be futile.”     McKinney v.

Thus, the question before this court on\n\nappeal is whether plaintiff’s complaint and amended complaint alleged sufficient\n\nfacts to support a legal claim.\n\n                 A. Cruel and Unusual Conditions of Confinement\n\n       The Eighth Amendment, applicable to the states through the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, “prohibits the infliction of ‘cruel and\n\nunusual punishment’ on those convicted of crimes.”         See Wilson v. Seiter , 501\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\fU.S. 294, 297 (1991). The Eighth Amendment requires jail officials “to provide\n\nhumane conditions of confinement by ensuring inmates receive the basic\n\nnecessities of adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care and by taking\n\nreasonable measures to guarantee the inmates’ safety.”       Barney v. Pulsipher , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754311\"><a href=\"/opinion/754311/susan-barney-kathy-christensen-v-gerald-r-pulsipher-individually-and-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1310 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\n       To hold a prison official personally liable for violating an inmate’s right to\n\nhumane conditions of confinement, a plaintiff must satisfy two requirements,\n\nconsisting of an objective and subjective component.       See id . The objective\n\ncomponent requires that the alleged deprivation be “sufficiently serious.”     Wilson ,\n\n501 U.S. at 298. Jail conditions may be “‘restrictive and even harsh’” without\n\nviolating constitutional rights.   Barney , 143 F.3d at 1311 ( quoting Rhodes v.\n\nChapman , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110518\"><a href=\"/opinion/110518/rhodes-v-chapman/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 347 (1981)). Indeed, “only those deprivations denying\n\nthe minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities . . . are sufficiently grave to\n\nform the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation.”        Wilson , 501 U.S. at 298\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted);    accord Farmer v.

See Barney , 143 F.3d at 1311 (“An important factor in\n\ndetermining whether the conditions of confinement meet constitutional standards\n\nis the length of the incarceration.”). Additionally, when, as in this case, a claim\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\finvolves a number of inhumane confinement conditions, the court must bear in\n\nmind that:\n\n       Some conditions of confinement may establish an Eighth Amendment\n       violation “in combination” when each would not do so alone, but\n       only when they have a mutually enforcing effect that produces the\n       deprivation of a single, identifiable human need such as food,\n       warmth, or exercise--for example, a low cell temperature at night\n       combined with a failure to issue blankets. . . . Nothing so amorphous\n       as “overall conditions” can rise to the level of cruel and unusual\n       punishment when no specific deprivation of a single human need\n       exists.\n\nWilson , 501 U.S. at 304-05 (citations omitted);        accord Mitchell v.

In the context of\n\nprison-conditions claims, the required state of mind is one of “‘deliberate\n\nindifference’ to inmate health and safety.”         Farmer , 511 U.S. at 834 ( quoting\n\nWilson , 501 U.S. at 302-03). In other words, a prison official is liable only if he\n\nor she “knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health and safety; the\n\nofficial must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that\n\na substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.”\n\nId. at 837. “It is not enough to establish that the official should have known of\n\nthe risk of harm.”   Barney , 143 F.3d at 1310.\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\f      Here, plaintiff’s allegations that on two separate occasions he was placed in\n\nisolation without clothes, a mattress, or bedding, and without any means to keep\n\nwarm support his conditions of confinement claim sufficiently to withstand sua\n\nsponte dismissal.   See Wilson , 501 U.S. at 304-05 (defining warmth as an\n\n“identifiable human need,” the deprivation of which may constitute an Eighth\n\nAmendment violation).     In a case with similar facts to those alleged by plaintiff,\n\nthis court reversed the district court’s grant of judgment as a matter of law on the\n\nappellant’s claim of cruel and unusual punishment where the appellant had been\n\n      stripped of his clothing, placed in a concrete cell, with no heat at a\n      time when nighttime temperatures hovered in the mid-fifties,\n      provided no mattress, blankets or bedding of any kind, deprived of\n      his prescription eyeglasses, not allowed to leave his cell for exercise,\n      not provided with writing utensils, not provided with adequate\n      ventilation, not provided with hot water, and only sometimes allowed\n      minimal amounts of toilet paper.\n\nMitchell , 80 F.3d at 1442. The Mitchell court concluded that these conditions\n\n“could constitute a violation of [plaintiff’s] right to be free of cruel and unusual\n\npunishments.”   Id. at 1443.\n\n      Although the court on remand will have to determine whether the relatively\n\nshort duration of the deprivation ameliorates the violation, we conclude that\n\nplaintiff has stated a claim of cruel and unusual conditions of confinement\n\nsufficient to withstand summary dismissal.\n\n                                    B.

Dubois , </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 n.1 (10th Cir. 1990).\n\n        “[B]ecause the ultimate fact of retaliation turns on defendant’s state of\n\nmind, it is particularly difficult to establish by direct evidence.”       Smith , 899 F.2d\n\nat 949. As in Smith , a claim of such retaliation may be established by “the only\n\n\n\n\n                                              -11-\n\fmeans available . . . circumstantial evidence.”       Id. at 949. Here, we believe\n\nplaintiff’s complaint alleged such circumstantial evidence.\n\n       Plaintiff asserted that he was placed in segregation without notice of the\n\ncharges against him and without a hearing.         See Hughes v. Rowe , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110352\"><a href=\"/opinion/110352/hughes-v-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11\n\n(1980) (noting that if the purpose of segregation is punishment, “[s]egregation of\n\na prisoner without a prior hearing may violate due process if the postponement of\n\nprocedural protections is not justified by apprehended emergency conditions.”).\n\nAccepting plaintiff’s statements as true,    see Leonhardt , 160 F.3d at 634, it is\n\napparent that the conditions in plaintiff’s isolation cell were punitive. Moreover,\n\nthere is obviously “temporal proximity” between the filing of plaintiff’s original\n\ncomplaint on December 1, 1997, and his placement in isolation on December 22,\n\n1997. Smith , 899 F.2d at 948. Plaintiff asserts that when Amin questioned\n\nOfficer Pacheco as to the reason for their segregation, Officer Pacheco responded\n\nthat plaintiff was there for filing suit.\n\n       Therefore, insofar as plaintiff is asserting that he was placed into punitive\n\nsegregation in retaliation for exercising his constitutional rights in filing a civil\n\nrights action against defendants, plaintiff states a cause of action. In concluding\n\nthat plaintiff has sufficiently supported his allegations of retaliation, we are not,\n\nhowever, suggesting that a reasonable fact finder would necessarily find in his\n\nfavor. Rather, we are only concluding that on the facts and evidence provided,\n\n\n                                            -12-\n\fsummary dismissal of plaintiff’s retaliation claim was improper.      See Frazier ,\n\n922 F.2d at 562 (“Because [plaintiff] may be able to prove that his transfer was a\n\nresult of improper retaliation by prison officials to punish plaintiff for\n\nconstitutionally protected activity,” dismissal as frivolous under § 1915(d) was\n\nimproper); cf. Smith , 899 F.2d at 947-49 (discussing evidentiary showing on\n\nclaim of retaliation sufficient to survive summary judgment).\n\n                                    C. Leave to Amend\n\n       Finally, plaintiff asserts that the district court erred in dismissing his\n\ncomplaint without affording him leave to amend. Whether to allow amendment\n\nof a complaint is a matter left to the district court’s discretion.   See Gillette v.\n\nTansy , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663778\"><a href=\"/opinion/663778/ronald-edward-gillette-v-robert-j-tansy-and-attorney-general-of-the-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 312 (10th Cir. 1994). Therefore, because we are remanding\n\nthe case to the district court for further proceedings, the issue of amendment is\n\nbest left to the district court’s discretion on remand.\n\n\n                                      III. Conclusion\n\n\n\n\n                                              -13-\n\f      Here, accepting plaintiff’s factual allegations as true,   see Leonhardt , 160\n\nF.3d at 634, it is clear that he has alleged sufficient facts upon which a\n\ncognizable legal claim could be based,     see Hall , 935 F.2d at 1110. Therefore,\n\nthe judgments of dismissal of the United States District Court for the District of\n\nWyoming as to plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claim of cruel and unusual\n\npunishment and his claim of retaliation for exercising his constitutional rights are\n\nREVERSED, and the claims are REMANDED for further proceedings in\n\naccordance with this order and judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                         Entered for the Court\n\n\n\n                                                         Wade Brorby\n                                                         Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\f</pre>",
