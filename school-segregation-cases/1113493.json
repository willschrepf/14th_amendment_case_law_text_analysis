We are required to determine whether the district court correctly found that the conditions of confinement in TDC violate the Constitution and, if so, whether the remedy imposed went beyond the correction of constitutional deficiencies and intruded unduly on the state's management of its prison system or enmeshed the court in the details of prison management.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's finding that TDC imposes cruel and unusual punishment on inmates in its custody as a result of the totality of conditions in its prisons.  We also affirm the district court's finding that some of TDC's practices deny inmates due process of law.  We affirm its conclusion that remedial measures are necessary.  Concluding, however, that the district court inappropriately considered state law claims not raised by the parties, we reverse its order that TDC conform its practices to state statutory requirements.  We also conclude that some of the remedial measures ordered are not demonstrably required to protect constitutional rights and intrude unduly on matters of state concern and we, therefore, narrow the scope of the relief ordered.  An outline of our lengthy opinion is set forth in the margin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. INTRODUCTORY FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Texas state prison system, operated by TDC, is the largest in the United States.  Its inmates, now numbering more than 33,000, are confined in cells or dormitories located in twenty-two separate units, almost all of which have maximum security.  Most of the approximately 10,000 cells measure nine feet by five feet, but some are as large as sixty-six square feet.  Most of the dormitories house large numbers of inmates and are crowded.  After the consolidation of eight separate actions by individual inmates against W. J. Estelle, the Director of TDC, challenging the conditions of their confinement, the district court certified the case as a class action and permitted the United States to intervene as a plaintiff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial began in Houston on October 2, 1978, and, after 159 days of trial, bridging a three-month recess, was completed on September 20, 1979.  Three hundred forty-nine witnesses testified and 1,565 exhibits were received into evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  The district court issued a 118-page memorandum opinion on December 12, 1980, indicating generally the relief it proposed to grant, and gave the parties an opportunity to agree on a proposed judgment.  The parties later filed a proposed consent decree disposing of many of the issues.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The district court approved this consent decree, entered a decree granting equitable relief and a declaratory judgment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> on the issues not disposed of by the consent decree, appointed a special master to monitor implementation of the relief ordered,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and denied TDC's motion for a stay.  TDC then applied to this court for a stay, which we granted in part and denied in part.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  TDC later sought a supplemental stay, which, again, we granted in part and denied in part.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  The parties then agreed to a second consent decree that modified parts of the district court's decree, and we remanded the case to enable the district court to hold a class action hearing on the proposed modifications.  After that hearing, the district court approved the second consent decree<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> and, in accordance with its terms, TDC moved under Fed.R.App.P. 42(b) for voluntary dismissal of its appeal of the provisions of the district court's decree<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> that were superseded by the second consent decree.  The case has also been before us on interlocutory appeals; this marks its seventh appearance in our court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the pervasive issues still contested: TDC's attack on the fairness of the trial, the sufficiency of the district court's findings of fact, the intervention by the United States, and the joinder of the Texas Board of Corrections and individual members of the Board as parties defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. FAIRNESS OF THE TRIAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TDC contends that the district judge made many errors in his rulings concerning the conduct of the trial and the admissibility of evidence, the cumulative effect of which was so prejudicial as to deny TDC its right to a fair trial.  The impugnment is more than a challenge to specific rulings, however, for it includes assertions that \"the entire record is permeated with favoritism\" toward the plaintiffs and \"unrelenting unfairness\" toward TDC and is infected both by \"evident prejudgment\" of the case in the plaintiffs' favor and by judicial bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional guarantee of due process of law ordains a fair trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  The trial judge must not become \"personally embroiled\" in the proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  He must not assume the role of prosecutor<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> or defender.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  He must avoid even the appearance of favoring one side.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  However, \"(o)nly when the judge's conduct strays from neutrality is a defendant thereby denied a fair trial as required by the Constitution.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  Moreover, even if the trial judge does commit error, it is presumed harmless until shown to be prejudicial.  The complaining party must prove that the error was substantial and that it prejudiced his case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the trial judge must be neutral, he should not be a passive spectator.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  \"He is a common law judge having that authority historically exercised by judges in the common law process,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> and not simply come but to say, \"sustained,\" or \"overruled.\"  He may, when in his sound discretion he deems it advisable, comment on the evidence, question witnesses, elicit facts not yet adduced or clarify those previously presented, and maintain the pace of the trial by interrupting or setting time limits on counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  He must not usurp the role of counsel, but he may manage the trial's course to achieve a \"just, speedy, and inexpensive determination\" of the action.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  Obviously he has greater latitude in conducting a bench trial, for then it is his duty to determine the facts, and his conduct cannot influence jurors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  In complex and protracted trials like this one, the trial judge must assume even greater responsibility for the direction of the trial than he undertakes in short and simple ones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pretrial discovery in this case was exhaustive, the district judge required complete pretrial disclosure of expected testimony, and he limited to some degree the length of cross-examination of a number of witnesses.  The trial nevertheless lasted almost a full year.  After the plaintiffs had presented all of their witnesses and the United States, as plaintiff-intervenor, had presented most of its witnesses, there was a three-month recess, ample time for TDC to prepare refutation and rebuttal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a>  All of these factors, together with the fact that the judge was the factfinder, must be considered in evaluating TDC's contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conduct of the district judge is attacked with a barrage of charges.  TDC contends that his pretrial orders were more exacting of TDC than of the other parties,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> and that during pretrial proceedings he was partial to the plaintiffs in many respects.  TDC also contends that he excluded much of TDC's evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> treated TDC's witnesses unfairly in comparison with the treatment accorded the plaintiffs' witnesses,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> and improperly limited TDC's cross-examinations and rebuttals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> TDC contends generally that the record is \"permeated with favoritism.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the full record of the lengthy trial, we find little probative value in the excluded evidence, and no prejudice in the district judge's rulings.  TDC has not pointed to a single instance of the exclusion of defense testimony that was not either repetitive or insignificant in probative value.  Error cannot be predicated on an evidentiary ruling unless a substantial right of the objecting party is affected.  Fed.R.Evid. 103(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a>  The district judge was required to make literally thousands of decisions on evidentiary issues, usually without advance notice, memoranda from counsel, or opportunity for independent research.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>  In deciding such matters, trial judges are not expected to be either infallible or clairvoyant.  The rules of evidence exact only the attainable, the avoidance of error that is prejudicial and affects a substantial right.  This standard was fully met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One time the district judge showed plaintiffs' counsel how to lay a foundation for testimony and four times he relieved a plaintiffs' lawyer who was having difficulty laying a predicate by asking the necessary questions himself.  Doubtless the floundering lawyer eventually could have satisfied the formalities of each objection.  Doubtless the need to conform to proper procedure gave the lawyer good, albeit embarrassing, experience.  We see no reason, however, why the district judge should have further protracted the trial by requiring the lawyer eventually to master each difficulty alone, for there was no jury to be affected, and the judge himself could deftly cut what was only a technical knot and expedite the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge did credit the testimony of the plaintiffs' witnesses more frequently than that of TDC's witnesses, but in a bench trial the assessment of witness credibility is inherently his province.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a>  We are especially reluctant to set aside findings that are based upon a trial judge's determination of the credibility of witnesses giving contradictory accounts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither any one episode pointed out in the briefs nor the weight of all of them cumulatively demonstrates that the trial was unfair.  At the outset, the trial judge granted TDC's motion for a six-month postponement of the trial date.  At TDC's motion, and for TDC's convenience, he changed the venue of the trial.  After the plaintiffs and the United States had rested, he gave TDC three months to prepare its defense.  He struck the testimony of the plaintiffs' witness who was shown to have violated the nondiscussion rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond either human capacity or the demands of justice that the trial judge decide correctly every issue arising in the trial.  What is required is not a perfect score, but fairness, probity, and the avoidance of substantial prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first and second consent decrees settled many of the controverted issues, to which much of the trial testimony was devoted.  On the matters covered by the consent decrees, their provisions were substantially the same as the remedies outlined by the district judge in his opinion.  In addition, TDC does not contest many of the provisions of the district court's decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a>  Although this acquiescence is in no sense fatal to TDC's claims, it does indicate that TDC in effect concedes the correctness of many provisions in the district court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge's rulings appear to have been based only on what he learned from his seat on the bench and his perception of the evidence.  Any adverse attitudes that he evinced were based on his performance of his judicial duties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a>  The remarks of some lawyers during the trial carry notes of testiness and personal involvement that go beyond mere diligent representation of a client's interests, but the district judge never became personally embroiled in the proceedings and he presided over them patiently and fairly.  We find neither abuse of discretion nor prejudicial error in his conduct of the trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE FINDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying upon the first sentence of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), which requires the district court after a bench trial to \"find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon,\" TDC contends that the district court failed to make findings of fact sufficiently specific for appellate review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge should set forth preliminary and basic facts rather than \"(s)tatements conclusory in nature.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a> Ultimate findings must be specifically supported.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a>  The opinion in this case, as we have already noted, occupies 118 printed pages.  More than half of it is devoted to findings of fact.  Some of the factual recitals are specific.  In deciding other factual issues, the district judge drew inferences concerning general conditions from specific instances.  His findings are not apodictic conclusions of the kind we have found insufficient as a basis for review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a> They are sufficient to give us a \"clear understanding of the analytical process by which ultimate findings were reached and to assure us that the trial court took care in ascertaining the facts.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a>  However convenient it might be for counsel and the appellate court to have \"specific citations to the record,\" the absence of which TDC criticizes, such citations are not required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the findings are sufficient, they were, as our comments suggest, not all made with the same specificity; indeed, the very nature of some of the issues rendered particularity impossible.  The district judge could and did find whether or not a record was made of disciplinary proceedings.  He could and did find whether or not on particular occasions one inmate assaulted another.  From these data he could and did deduce whether or not it had been shown that inmate assaults were so frequent as to create an atmosphere of violence.  That kind of finding, reached by inference from specific data, is both proper and requisite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the data observed are sufficient to warrant a general conclusion must be determined by logic and judgment.  The human events of the past cannot be sampled so perfectly as to permit a statistically valid analysis.  This kind of conclusion is not a mixed question of fact and law or one of legal inferences from the facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a>  It is instead one of the sufficiency of an evidentiary basis for a factual conclusion.  Although that type of conclusion does not rest on the credibility of witnesses or the advantage of firsthand observation, it is equally a question of fact, to be accepted by us unless clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to both kinds of factual conclusions, we find the district judge's opinion sufficient to give us a clear understanding of the views he took of the evidence, the analytical process by which he reached his conclusions, and the basis by which he applied legal principles to these facts.  No more is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. INTERVENTION BY THE UNITED STATES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, acting sua sponte, on April 12, 1974, \"determined that the public interest will be served by the participation of the United States\" and ordered the United States to appear as amicus curiae and to participate in this case \"with the full rights of a party.\"  W. J. Estelle, the Director of TDC, was then the only defendant.  After appearing as amicus curiae, the United States moved in December 1974 to intervene as a party plaintiff under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b)(2), and also sought leave to file a complaint in intervention adding new causes of action, and adding the Texas Board of Corrections and its individual members as additional defendants.  The United States relied upon \"the inherent authority of the United States, through its Attorney General, to sue to remedy severe and widespread deprivations of constitutional rights.\"  The motion was granted ex parte and TDC's later motion to dismiss the United States both as plaintiff-intervenor and as amicus curiae was denied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not the United States had inherent or implied authority to sue or to intervene in suits to protect the constitutional rights of individual citizens at the time the intervention was filed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a> Congress has since enacted the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 1997-1997j (West 1981) (\"the Act\"), which became law on May 23, 1980.  The Act authorizes the Attorney General to initiate, id. &#167;&#167; 1997a-1997b, or intervene in, id. &#167; 1997c, civil actions on behalf of persons confined in specified state institutions, including jails, prisons, and other correctional facilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision unless there is statutory language or legislative history to the contrary, or unless doing so would cause manifest injustice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a>  It must apply that law \"even where (the statute) does not explicitly recite that it is to be applied to pending cases.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a>  The \"law\" at issue in this case is the Act, particularly &#167; 1997c, which deals with intervention by the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That section of the Act comprises two elements: a substantive provision authorizing the Attorney General to intervene in lawsuits, and procedural provisions with which the United States must comply before it may intervene.  Nothing in the Act or its legislative history suggests that we should not apply the substantive provision of &#167; 1997c to this case.  If anything, the legislative history reinforces the presumption that we should apply it.  The Senate Report notes that the Justice Department has intervened in many suits<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a> and expresses approval of such intervention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a>  Moreover, the Senate Report,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a> the dissent from the Senate Report,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a> and the House Conference Report<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fn59_ref\">59</a> all express the view that the United States already had the authority to intervene in such cases, and that the Act merely gave it explicit statutory sanction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fn60_ref\">60</a>  We cannot read this legislative history as expressing hostility to pre-Act intervention by the United States.  To do so would achieve a result at odds with the understanding of both the supporters and the opponents of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a>  We conclude, therefore, that the substantive provision of &#167; 1997c applies in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of the Act does, however, lead us to conclude that we should not apply the procedural provisions of &#167; 1997c in this case.  The Senate Report explicitly states that the Act aims to preclude, inter alia, the possibility that \"suits in which the United States is currently participating as amicus or plaintiff-intervenor will be disrupted by defendant(s') motions to dismiss the United States as a party.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a>  Moreover, in discussing other sections of the Act, the legislative history notes other goals of the Act: making Justice Department resources available in lawsuits challenging the conditions of confinement in state institutions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a> improving the lives of persons confined in state institutions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fn64_ref\">64</a> encouraging state officials to take action to safeguard the rights of these persons,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fn65_ref\">65</a> achieving efficient use of Justice Department resources,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fn66_ref\">66</a> and ensuring \"conservation of judicial resources.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn67\" id=\"fn67_ref\">67</a>  To dismiss the United States at this state in the litigation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn68\" id=\"fn68_ref\">68</a> when it could simply initiate a new lawsuit,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn69\" id=\"fn69_ref\">69</a> and thereby duplicate its previous, massive efforts, would do violence to all of these goals.  We decline to \"cause great disruption by forcing the parties ... to begin anew a case that all parties agree could eventually be decided under the new law.

J. Estelle, the Director of TDC, was named as defendant.  In its complaint in intervention, however, the United States also named as defendants the Texas Board of Corrections and its individual members.  Texas law charges the Board of Corrections \"with the exclusive management and control of\" TDC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn73\" id=\"fn73_ref\">73</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This action was initiated under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, which provides that \"(e) very person\" who, under color of law, subjects a citizen to deprivation of his federal rights shall be liable to that citizen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn74\" id=\"fn74_ref\">74</a>  The states' eleventh amendment sovereign immunity bars an action in federal court against a state or a state agency unless the state has consented to suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn75\" id=\"fn75_ref\">75</a>  Congress, in enacting &#167; 1983, did not intend \"to override the traditional sovereign immunity of the states.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn76\" id=\"fn76_ref\">76</a> Thus neither states nor state agencies are \"persons\" within the meaning of &#167; 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn77\" id=\"fn77_ref\">77</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board of Corrections is merely an agency of the state.  It is, therefore, neither a \"person\" nor, consequently, a proper party defendant.  As the United States now concedes, the district court's judgment must be reversed insofar as it casts the Board as a defendant, and the Board, as an entity, must be dismissed from this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn78\" id=\"fn78_ref\">78</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The individual members of the Board, however, are of course persons.  Although the Texas statute vests management of the prison system in the Board, the Board members are responsible as individuals, in the same manner as the Director of TDC, for any violation of constitutional rights caused by their management.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn79\" id=\"fn79_ref\">79</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TDC contends that the Board members are superfluous defendants because the Director of TDC is also a defendant and can respond to any court orders.  The mere fact that one defendant can pay a judgment or effectuate a court order has never been deemed reason to dismiss other persons who are legally responsible to the plaintiff, and TDC cites no authority for the proposition that one amenable defendant suffices.  Accordingly, the joinder of the individual members of the Board was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI.

In Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981), which was decided after the district court had rendered its opinion and its orders in this case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn80\" id=\"fn80_ref\">80</a> the Supreme Court considered for the first time the limitation that the eighth amendment, which is applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn81\" id=\"fn81_ref\">81</a> \"imposes upon the conditions in which a State may confine those convicted of crimes.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn82\" id=\"fn82_ref\">82</a>  After reviewing \"the Eighth Amendment precedents for the general principles that are relevant to a State's authority to impose punishment for criminal conduct,\" the Court noted that the amendment \"prohibits punishments which, although not physically barbarous, 'involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn83\" id=\"fn83_ref\">83</a>  Thus the eighth amendment prohibits inflictions of pain that are \" 'totally without penological justification.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn84\" id=\"fn84_ref\">84</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"No static 'test' can exist by which courts determine whether conditions of confinement are cruel and unusual, for the Eighth Amendment 'must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn85\" id=\"fn85_ref\">85</a> These \" 'judgments should not be, or appear to be, merely the subjective views of individual (judges).' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn86\" id=\"fn86_ref\">86</a>  The judgments instead \" 'should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn87\" id=\"fn87_ref\">87</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same \"principles apply when the conditions of confinement compose the punishment at issue.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn88\" id=\"fn88_ref\">88</a>  \"(C)onditions that cannot be said to be cruel and unusual under contemporary standards are not unconstitutional.

Double-celling was made necessary by an unanticipated increase in prison population.  It did not lead to deprivations of essential food, medical care, or sanitation.  It did not \"increase violence among inmates or create other conditions intolerable for prison confinement.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn90\" id=\"fn90_ref\">90</a>  It diminished job and educational opportunities only \"marginally.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn91\" id=\"fn91_ref\">91</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court had previously noted other facts.  The cells measured sixty-three square feet.  Each had a cabinet-type night stand and other furnishings.  Double-celling had not reduced significantly the availability of space in the day rooms or visitation rooms, nor had it rendered the library or school facilities inadequate.  There had been no increase in the rate of violence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn92\" id=\"fn92_ref\">92</a>  The ratio of guards to inmates \"satisfied the standard of acceptability\" offered by the inmates' expert witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn93\" id=\"fn93_ref\">93</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This review of the opinion makes it evident that Rhodes v. Chapman does not reject the \"totality of conditions\" test that we applied in Jones v. Diamond, 636 F.2d 1364, 1368 (5th Cir. 1981) (en banc).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn94\" id=\"fn94_ref\">94</a>  Like Justice Brennan in his concurring opinion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn95\" id=\"fn95_ref\">95</a> we read the majority opinion in Rhodes v. Chapman as adopting that test, just as another panel of this court recently did in Stewart v. Winter, 669 F.2d 328, 335-36 &amp; n.17 (5th Cir. 1982).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn96\" id=\"fn96_ref\">96</a>  This interpretation is based not only on the opinion's precise and carefully chosen words but on its factual recitals.  Were it necessary to decide only that confining two inmates in a single cell is not cruel and unusual punishment, there would have been no need to describe the general conditions in the prison.  Rhodes holds that the confinement of two persons in one cell is not per se cruel and unusual when, all prison conditions having been considered \"alone or in combination,\" inmates are not deprived of the \"minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn97\" id=\"fn97_ref\">97</a>  This is also the reading that other courts have given to Rhodes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn98\" id=\"fn98_ref\">98</a>  Rhodes does, however, hold that the totality of the conditions of confinement does not offend the Constitution unless prison conditions are cruel and unusual, and not merely harsh or restrictive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These precepts provide the illumination by which we examine those provisions of the district court's decree based on the eighth amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.2 Findings by the District Court</p>\n    <p>6.21 Overcrowding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of trial, TDC confined over 26,000 inmates.  (The inmate population has since increased to over 33,000.)  About 1,000 were sleeping on floors.  (None are now on floors but many are confined in tents.)  In cells measuring forty-five square feet,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn99\" id=\"fn99_ref\">99</a> originally designed for one occupant, TDC confined two to four inmates.  The district court found that assault or molestation by fellow inmates was a continual threat.  It found that the population density of inmates confined in dormitories was \"shocking.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn100\" id=\"fn100_ref\">100</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This overcrowding \"exercises a malignant effect on all aspects of inmate life.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn101\" id=\"fn101_ref\">101</a>  Day rooms designed for recreational purposes must serve double and even triple the number of inmates for which they were planned.  Access to gymnasiums, outdoor playing fields, craft shops, and libraries is even more limited.  Dining rooms are nearly always crowded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn102\" id=\"fn102_ref\">102</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although TDC contends that, because of TDC's \"work ethic,\" inmates spend little of their time in cells or dormitory sleeping areas, in fact inmates spend much of their time in their living quarters.  Because of a shortage of civilian guards who can be assigned to supervise inmates working in agricultural programs, the full complement of inmates assigned to work on TDC's farms cannot safely be employed on any given day.  \"Therefore, at many units, the inmates work on a rotating basis.  As many as one-half to three-fourths of the inmate agricultural force will remain idle in the living quarters on a specific day.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn103\" id=\"fn103_ref\">103</a>  In view of the \"unprecedented surge\" in prison population, new facilities being constructed will not eliminate the overcrowding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn104\" id=\"fn104_ref\">104</a>  The district judge emphasized the threat to the inmates' safety, the lack of privacy for inmates, the increase in stress and tension, and the possible spread of disease, all caused by overcrowding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn105\" id=\"fn105_ref\">105</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.22 Security and Supervision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TDC's prisons are severely understaffed.  During the summer of 1979, TDC employed one guard for every 12.45 inmates, one of the worst guard-inmate ratios in the nation;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn106\" id=\"fn106_ref\">106</a>  the average nationally is one guard for every five inmates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn107\" id=\"fn107_ref\">107</a>  TDC's argument that its system requires fewer guards than others was rejected by the district court after a detailed analysis of staffing patterns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn108\" id=\"fn108_ref\">108</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Overcrowding, combined with the relatively small number of security guards, results in a \"constant threat to the inmates' personal safety.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn109\" id=\"fn109_ref\">109</a>  Escapes are virtually unheard of and homicides are uncommon, but there is excessive nonhomicidal violence.  \"(V)irtually all inmates are exposed to, and many are victimized by, the concomitants of unguarded, overcrowded cells and dormitories-the ever-present risk of assaults, rapes and other violence-for every day of their incarceration at TDC.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn110\" id=\"fn110_ref\">110</a> \"TDC inmates are routinely subjected to brutality, extortion, and rape\" by their cellmates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn111\" id=\"fn111_ref\">111</a>  \"Inmates who live in dormitories are exposed to the same threats of violence endemic to the cells.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn112\" id=\"fn112_ref\">112</a>  The threat to inmates in dormitories may be even greater because \"(p)otentially assaultive inmates are present in great numbers in every dormitory\" and the dormitories are \"practically unsupervised.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn113\" id=\"fn113_ref\">113</a>  \"Numerous examples of the inability of TDC staff to protect inmates' personal safety were graphically presented by credible testimony at the trial.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn114\" id=\"fn114_ref\">114</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These conditions result from having too few civilian guards to supervise inmate activities adequately, from inadequate training for new guards, and from a high turnover rate that \"results in virtually perpetual vacancies in low-level guard positions.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn115\" id=\"fn115_ref\">115</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.23 Failure To Ameliorate Overcrowding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TDC officials have the power, the district judge found, to reduce TDC's inmate population quickly by increasing \"good time\" credit, and restoring forfeited good time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn116\" id=\"fn116_ref\">116</a>  Inmates receive incentive (\"PIP\") points for good performance in work, education, and personal improvement programs.  The Board of Pardons and Paroles declines to interview any inmate who has less than a specified number of PIP points, who has suffered a forfeiture of good time that has not been restored, or who is in Class III status.  By awarding more PIP points, restoring lost good time, classifying more inmates in Class I status, and preparing favorable \"institutional adjustment\" reports, TDC officials could increase the number of inmates likely to receive parole.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn117\" id=\"fn117_ref\">117</a>  Moreover, TDC has failed to implement in more than a \"half-hearted and unimaginative\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn118\" id=\"fn118_ref\">118</a> fashion the work release program authorized by Texas law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn119\" id=\"fn119_ref\">119</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.3 Challenges to the Findings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The web of conditions is not seamless.  The findings of fact concerning various conditions at TDC are discrete.  Moreover, the injunctive relief ordered by the district court includes provisions patently and properly directed at specific conditions.  We now consider TDC's challenges to those findings that determine the totality of conditions caused by overcrowding in the presence of the other conditions discussed, particularly the size of the security staff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge's conclusion that TDC's prisons are seriously overcrowded is virtually conceded.  TDC questions only whether this overcrowding constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, whether the remedies ordered are appropriate, and whether specific provisions of the decree are \"ill-considered and unwise.\"  TDC challenges the findings concerning the inadequacy of prison security and the existence of staff brutality as being clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge's findings concerning the specific episodes mentioned in his opinion turn entirely on the credibility of witnesses.  On this, as on virtually every other aspect of the case, there was conflicting testimony.  There was substantial evidence on the record to support the district judge's findings, and we have been given no reason to overturn them, save the inadequate reason that the testimony of others conflicts.  We do not sit to reassess that testimony.  This is neither our function as appellate judges nor within our power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn120\" id=\"fn120_ref\">120</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these specific findings, the district judge made other, more general factual findings.  He found that the life of the typical inmate within TDC is characterized by a constant threat of violence and that TDC staff members engage in \"widespread\" brutality of inmates.  These findings necessarily are partly conclusory; their accuracy depends on inferences from the specific facts established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering that TDC houses more than 33,000 inmates, it is proper to ask the question that this court put to counsel before oral argument: how many episodes of inmate assault must be shown to warrant the conclusion that there is a constant threat of violence?  Patently the trial should not and cannot consist of a review either of every assault over a five-year period or of a day in the life of each of the inmates.  The statistics presented are inconclusive.  The homicide rate at TDC is less than in many cities.  The assault rate is less than the rate reported in other prison cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn121\" id=\"fn121_ref\">121</a> but this means only that other prisons are worse.  The guard-inmate ratio is among the lowest in the nation.  Considering the record as a whole, we are not left with that impression requisite to rejecting the district judge's findings, \"the definite and firm conviction\" that he was mistaken.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn122\" id=\"fn122_ref\">122</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.4 Relief Ordered by the District Court</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This relief is set forth in full in the Appendix to our opinion in Ruiz VI, 666 F.2d at 862-73, and summarized in Ruiz V, 650 F.2d at 559-64.

As we have pointed out, the constitutional mandate against cruel and unusual punishment is not a warranty of pleasant prison conditions.  Reparative injunctive relief must be targeted at elimination of the unconstitutional conditions.  \"(T)he nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn139\" id=\"fn139_ref\">139</a>  Therefore, a court can order only relief sufficient to correct the violation found.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn140\" id=\"fn140_ref\">140</a>  We have neither commission nor competence to prescribe the purposes of confinement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a matter of respect for the state's role and for the allocation of functions in our federal system, as well as comity toward the state, the relief ordered by federal courts must be \"consistent with the policy of minimum intrusion into the affairs of state prison administration that the Supreme Court has articulated for the federal courts.\"  Ruiz V, 650 F.2d at 571.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn141\" id=\"fn141_ref\">141</a>  \"(T)he principles of federalism which play such an important part in governing the relationship between federal courts and state governments\" are applicable \"where injunctive relief is sought ... against those in charge of an executive branch of an agency of state\" government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn142\" id=\"fn142_ref\">142</a>  We should, therefore, fashion \"the least intrusive remedy that will still be effective.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn143\" id=\"fn143_ref\">143</a>  In shaping that remedy, we must also, as a matter of judicial administration, regard the essential nature of federal courts in an adversary system.  Our remedial powers are inherently judicial, not administrative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn144\" id=\"fn144_ref\">144</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The experienced district judge gave lengthy and careful attention both to the trial of this case and to the fashioning of the reparative injunction.  In many respects the decree he shaped is focused directly on steps to remedy the aspects of confinement that together make it cruel and unusual.  In other respects the decree is, as the district court's order of reference to the special master recites, \"infinitely broader than that encountered in any other example of correctional litigation.\"  Considering both the constitutional violations to be excised and the scope of the therapy directed, we are left with the conviction that, without the guidance now provided by Rhodes v. Chapman, the district court adopted some remedies that are not essential for the elimination of unconstitutional prison conditions.  Taken as a whole, the district court's decree administers a massive curative dose when it is not yet demonstrable that a lesser therapeutic measure would not suffice.  Conservative treatment is essential because it is more readily administered, less costly to the state, and not irreversible.  Therefore, the remedy should begin with what is absolutely necessary.  If these measures later prove ineffective, more stringent ones should be considered.  We turn now to the specifics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.51 Overcrowding: Space Requirements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the number of inmates in one cell nor the amount of space provided for an inmate in a dormitory alone determines whether confinement is cruel and unusual.  See Ruiz VI, 666 F.2d at 858.  If an inmate uses his living quarters only for sleeping, and is not threatened with violence, a single bunk space, eighteen or twenty square feet, may be adequate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn145\" id=\"fn145_ref\">145</a>  The district judge found that the crowding of persons, the consequent effect on prison services and facilities, and the lack of security are specific conditions that combine to make confinement at TDC uncivilized and inhumane.  However, we cannot know whether the provision of additional guards and the consequent increase both in inmate security and in work opportunities, the diminished role of building tenders, and the various other remedial measures either incorporated in the consent decrees or approved by us elsewhere in this opinion will sufficiently relieve the conditions that combined to make double-celling cruel and unusual, with the result that confinement of two inmates to one forty-five-foot cell will be only the harshness sanctioned by Rhodes, or whether it will still be cruel and unusual.  Current estimates for maximum security prison cells suggest that their cost ranges from $30,000 to $60,000 apiece.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn146\" id=\"fn146_ref\">146</a>  Approximately 10,000 additional cells would be required to house in a single cell every person now in a double cell less than sixty square feet in area.  These additional cells, therefore, could cost at least $300,000,000 and require three to four years or more to build.  Prisons once built cannot be readily adapted to other governmental uses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Constitutional rights are not, of course, confined to those available at modest cost.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn147\" id=\"fn147_ref\">147</a>  The very concept of federalism, the division of powers among the branches of the federal government, and the nature of the safeguards imposed by the Bill of Rights and the fourteenth amendment levy costs impossible for an accountant to calculate, but esteemed by us because they are literally priceless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet in considering remedies for unconstitutional deprivation, the cost of one proposed remedy in comparison with the cost of others and the demonstrable need for the remedy should both be considered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn148\" id=\"fn148_ref\">148</a>  A remedy imposing great cost on a state should not be ordered unless its constitutional need has been demonstrated.  Although we recognize the great discretion accorded a trial judge in fashioning remedies,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn149\" id=\"fn149_ref\">149</a> the district judge here lacked the guidance of Rhodes v. Chapman and failed to consider the cost of the remedial measures ordered as well as the possibility of achieving constitutional conditions without requiring single-celling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the dormitory space limitation.  Neither sixty square feet, nor forty square feet, nor any other measure is constitutionally ordained.  Yet the facts found serve as adequate basis to require more space for inmates confined in dormitories, not only to ameliorate living conditions but, more important, to enhance security and reduce violence.  An inmate in a cell with one other person is exposed to assault only by that person; an inmate in an overcrowded dormitory having an inadequate security staff may be victimized by many.  Moreover, a forty-square-feet-per-inmate dormitory space requirement will not occasion vast expense.  At present, TDC is, by use of tents, providing forty square feet for most dormitory inmates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn150\" id=\"fn150_ref\">150</a>  Only 128 inmates are confined in dormitories that house more than they would if there were forty square feet per inmate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement of sixty square feet per inmate, however, would necessitate the construction of facilities for 2,831 additional inmates.  If it costs only $10,000 per inmate to construct a dormitory instead of the $30,000 amount used to estimate the cost of constructing cells, the construction of dormitories for these additional inmates would cost almost $30,000,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has not been demonstrated that provision of additional security guards and the other measures required by the district court's decree and the two consent decrees will not remedy the constitutional deficiency.  It appears desirable, therefore, first to undertake measures that will not be both costly and irreversible.  If these measures do not work, then additional ones may be necessary.  This \"wait and see\" approach ensures that the intrusion into state processes will be no greater than that required to achieve compliance with the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we affirm the provisions of the district court's decree that restrict TDC's acceptance of inmates to be housed in dormitories to those inmates who can be accommodated with a space of at least forty square feet.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn151\" id=\"fn151_ref\">151</a>  We vacate the provisions of the decree that require (1) single-celling and (2) sixty square feet per inmate in dormitories.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn152\" id=\"fn152_ref\">152</a>  This is without prejudice to the right of plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor to move for a further hearing, to be held one year after our order becomes effective, to determine whether, despite changes in prison conditions wrought as a result of it, compliance with constitutional requirements requires additional restrictions on inmate capacity.  This is also without prejudice to the correlative right of TDC to seek a relaxation of the decree if TDC can demonstrate that the Constitution does not compel continuance of the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.52 Other Measures To Relieve Overcrowding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mandate that TDC must use good time, parole, and furlough programs to relieve overcrowding unnecessarily invades the management responsibility of state officials.  Moreover, it requires detailed supervision of programs that relate only indirectly to the conditions of confinement.  Directing state officials to achieve specific results should suffice; how they will achieve those results must be left to them unless and until it can be demonstrated judicial intervention is necessary.  They may elect to balance prison population and physical facilities by parole, furloughs, pardons, confinement in county institutions, use of minimum security institutions for some inmates, changes in sentencing policies, or in other ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However inefficient the management of large prisons may be when compared with the administration of smaller ones, and however desirable it may be to locate prisons near large communities, the failure to do either does not cause confinement to be cruel and unusual.  Palaces may be erected in the wilderness.  Large prisons may be impersonal but they are not necessarily inhumane.  There is of course some relationship between the new-facilities provisions of the district court's decree and the amelioration of prison conditions, but the measure of therapeutic effect is patently small.  The effect of these remedial measures does not appear to us sufficient to warrant their economic cost, their intrusion on state decisionmaking, or the supervisory burden that their administration would impose on a federal court.  Therefore, we vacate Parts I(A)(1), I(A)(3)-(6), VII, and VIII of the district court's decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.53 Staff Training</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree specifies how correctional officers will be schooled.  If correctional officers are hired and trained, we must assume, until the contrary is shown, that they will be both trained and utilized with some minimal degree of wisdom.  If, after they are employed, it is demonstrated that TDC officials are still violating inmates' constitutional rights, additional steps can then be taken.  Here again, we deem the \"wait and see\" policy, rather than radical surgery, more in keeping with the constitutionally reparative function of the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate Part II(B) of the district court's decree.  This is without prejudice to the right of plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor to move for a further hearing, to be held one year from the date our order becomes effective, seeking further relief, or the correlative right of TDC to seek relaxation of the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.54 Classification of Inmates</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree requires only the filing of a plan.

Inmate assistants have amputated fingers, set bones, applied casts, sutured wounds, repaired Achilles' tendons, given injections, administered medications, and kept records.  Inmates, in many instances lacking adequate training, also serve as laboratory technicians, X-ray technicians, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, first aid attendants, and medical records clerks.  Many of the inmates assigned to these tasks are uneducated and some are illiterate.  The district court found \"numerous\" instances of \"(g)rievous neglect of the personal care of patients at the HUH,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn162\" id=\"fn162_ref\">162</a> but nothing in the findings indicates either that these are imminent in the hospital or that they are not remediable by a larger and better-trained staff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCAH standards are applied to hospitals in Texas by THA.

Of the 7,000 private hospitals in the United States, only 3,000 meet JCAH standards adequately for full accreditation and an additional 1,000 are on probation or one-year accreditation; the other 3,000 are not accredited because they do not meet the standards.  Literally millions of persons receiving private medical care are being treated in hospitals that do not meet the requirements imposed by the district court's decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Expert standards are a useful guide but they are not a constitutional measure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn163\" id=\"fn163_ref\">163</a>  Restricting use of HUH to Huntsville inmates and permitting it to render only infirmary care do not solve the medical care problem.  Moreover, there have been additional developments since the district court issued its decree.  By orders dated October 19, 1981, and November 5, 1981, the district court stayed the provision of its decree pertaining to HUH.  In its October 19 order, the district court directed TDC to file a formal response to particular suggestions made by the plaintiffs concerning HUH.  TDC filed this response.  In the court's November 5 order, TDC's response is described as exhibiting \"a commendable air of conciliation.\"  That order further directs the parties to meet and discuss possible agreement on continued operation of HUH.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the provision of the district court's decree pertaining to the HUH and remand that issue to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion after the district court has received a report concerning the results of the discussion it has ordered.  Should the district court consider injunctive relief still necessary, its order shall not command the closing of HUH or restrict its use solely to Huntsville inmates.  The order should instead be limited to requiring that TDC provide the minimum level of hospital care required by the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p>6.7 Double-Celling and Exercise for Inmates in Administrative Segregation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some inmates are confined to cells in a separate part of each unit for a variety of nonpunitive reasons.

This confinement is continual, unbroken by work assignment, school, or other outside activity.  Moreover, although a confined inmate's status is subject to regular review to determine whether the necessity for administrative segregation still exists, this review is no guarantee that the inmate will be released from segregation at an early date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn170\" id=\"fn170_ref\">170</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have held that inmates need regular exercise to maintain reasonably good physical and psychological health.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn171\" id=\"fn171_ref\">171</a> Although deprivation of exercise is not per se cruel and unusual punishment, in particular circumstances \"a deprivation may constitute an impairment of health forbidden under the eighth amendment.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn172\" id=\"fn172_ref\">172</a>  Courts have frequently stated that confinement of inmates for long periods of time without opportunity for regular physical exercise constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn173\" id=\"fn173_ref\">173</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of particular importance in determining an inmate's need for regular exercise are the size of his cell,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn174\" id=\"fn174_ref\">174</a> the amount of time the inmate spends locked in his cell each day,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn175\" id=\"fn175_ref\">175</a> and the overall duration of his confinement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn176\" id=\"fn176_ref\">176</a>  These together with the inmate's physical and other needs must be determined on the facts of each case and the evidence in each case should support the existence of any health hazard under the specific circumstances involved.

While the case was pending, the district judge issued five separate protective orders to minimize what he found to be TDC harassment of the plaintiffs and witnesses in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn196\" id=\"fn196_ref\">196</a>  On the record before us, we cannot conclude that the district court's findings were clearly erroneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn197\" id=\"fn197_ref\">197</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decree enjoins TDC from unlawfully interfering with inmates' access to courts, counsel, and public officials.  The decree prohibits censorship of attorney-client mail, ensures confidential attorney-client interviews, prohibits retaliation against inmates who complain of prison conditions or official misconduct, and requires that inmates have access to services and materials that would help them process their legal matters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn198\" id=\"fn198_ref\">198</a>  TDC does not contend that any of these provisions of the decree exceeds the district court's authority.  Because TDC has failed to eliminate these prevalent practices, which it contends it has never condoned, these provisions were appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TDC contends that, after our decision in Corpus v. Estelle, 551 F.2d 68 (5th Cir. 1977), TDC's practice of prohibiting inmates from giving or receiving actual legal assistance to or from each other was terminated.  Whether or not all vestiges of this practice have been eliminated, the injunction that we affirmed in Corpus provides an adequate remedy for it.  The decree in this case, therefore, must be modified to eliminate the duplication.  We do not find the district court's remedy in other respects either disproportionate to the conditions found or unduly intrusive on the state.  Therefore, we affirm Part V of the district court's decree, except for Part V(J), which we vacate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>7.2 Disciplinary Hearings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found a number of violations of inmates' right to due process in the administration of prison discipline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn199\" id=\"fn199_ref\">199</a> Some of these violations have been remedied by the first consent decree; others are addressed in Part IV of the district court's decree.  In this appeal, apart from the provisions dealing with administrative segregation, TDC objects only to a prophylactic provision that requires it to tape record or in some other way make a verbatim record of all disciplinary hearings, preserve the recordings for at least one year, and follow prescribed procedures for making the recordings available to inmates or their legal representatives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn200\" id=\"fn200_ref\">200</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TDC correctly points out that Wolff v.

TDC argues that the possibility that a recording would be released might inhibit the willingness of inmates to testify against other inmates.  It also argues that the existence of recordings creates the possibility of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information by counsel or a TDC employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that TDC had not maintained adequate written records of its disciplinary proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn202\" id=\"fn202_ref\">202</a>  Its decree is aimed directly at preventing any recurrence of that constitutional lapse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn203\" id=\"fn203_ref\">203</a>  Nothing in the decree forbids TDC to take measures to ensure the confidentiality of the recordings.  Indeed the district court took account of security concerns by permitting TDC to exclude from release to an inmate any portion of a recording containing material that was recorded while the inmate \"was excluded from the hearing for security reasons.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-settled that, under the fourteenth amendment, a court may require remedial measures that the Constitution does not of its own force initially require.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn204\" id=\"fn204_ref\">204</a>  Injunctive relief need not be confined to an order to cease an illegal practice.  Once a constitutional violation has been proved, the court may, if necessary, exert its equitable power to prevent repetition of the violation, not only by the force of the contempt sanction but also by commanding measures that safeguard against recurrence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn205\" id=\"fn205_ref\">205</a>  The tape recording provision imposes little expense or inconvenience on TDC, does not change the manner in which state officials discharge their duties, is narrowly focused to prevent repetition of a proved constitutional violation, and is not unnecessarily intrusive on state functions.

Avoiding decision of federal constitutional claims is, by contrast, an act of judicial self-restraint.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly declared that it will decide federal constitutional issues only if necessarily compelled to do so in order to decide a case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn224\" id=\"fn224_ref\">224</a>  If possible, it will avoid deciding such issues by deciding instead a dispositive, pendent state law claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn225\" id=\"fn225_ref\">225</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concept that a federal trial court may of its own volition, after trial, consider state law claims not pleaded by the plaintiffs does not appear consonant with either doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn226\" id=\"fn226_ref\">226</a> Not only does the court thus reshape the plaintiffs' suit, but it does so after trial when there is no opportunity to fashion proof or presentation directly to the state law issues.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn227\" id=\"fn227_ref\">227</a>  Moreover, because the applicability of general Texas statutes to state agencies is unclear,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn228\" id=\"fn228_ref\">228</a> the district court should have been reluctant to consider claims grounded on those statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn229\" id=\"fn229_ref\">229</a>  \"Needless decisions of state law should be avoided both as a matter of comity and to promote justice between the parties, by procuring for them a surer-footed reading of applicable law.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn230\" id=\"fn230_ref\">230</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court should not have relied on pendent jurisdiction and should not, therefore, have decided these claims on the basis of state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the various health and safety deficiencies found by the district judge to appraise whether they, considered either alone or together with the other conditions at TDC, constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  Aside from the fire hazards discussed earlier, these deficiencies are: the sanitation problems resulting from overcrowding, which facilitate the spread of disease and tax sanitary facilities; inadequate plumbing; violations of food handling standards at some units; violations of sanitation standards in food processing areas; and inadequate safety measures in TDC's industrial operations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn231\" id=\"fn231_ref\">231</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we do not condone TDC's failure to observe the standards applicable to private industry, we do not find that any of these conditions alone, or all of them together, considered in combination with the overcrowding and security deficiencies, constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  The reduction of overcrowding will patently relieve some of these conditions.  The others can and should be attacked in a state court action in which the question of applicability of the statutes in question to TDC can be considered directly, not as a peripheral issue in this already complex case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IX.

It imposes on the special master the responsibility of seeing that the district court's decree is implemented, and empowers him to hold hearings, find facts, and make recommendations to the district court concerning TDC's compliance with the decree.  As authority for the appointment the district court invoked both Fed.R.Civ.P. 53<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn233\" id=\"fn233_ref\">233</a> and its inherent power as a court of equity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TDC contends that the appointment of a special master was improper because the district court failed to comply with rule 53, which, according to TDC, codifies and limits a court's authority to appoint a special master.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn234\" id=\"fn234_ref\">234</a>  Rule 53(b) states that a district court may appoint a special master \"only upon a showing that some exceptional condition requires\" the appointment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn235\" id=\"fn235_ref\">235</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated several reasons for its decision to make the appointment: the difficulty of superintending the implementation of \"a comprehensive, detailed plan for the elimination of the unconstitutional conditions found to exist in the Texas prison system\"; TDC's \"record of intransigence toward previous court orders requiring changes in TDC's practices and conditions\";<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn236\" id=\"fn236_ref\">236</a>  the \"strained\" working relations between TDC's lawyers and the plaintiffs' lawyers; TDC's failure to acknowledge even \"completely evident\" constitutional violations; and TDC's failure to conform its actual practices to its written policies and procedures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn237\" id=\"fn237_ref\">237</a>  The district court did not, as TDC implies, simply rely on the \"mere complexity\" of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn238\" id=\"fn238_ref\">238</a> Moreover, the court was not required to await the failure or refusal of TDC to comply with the decree before appointing an agent to implement it.  Noncompliance may constitute one \"exceptional condition\" under rule 53,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn239\" id=\"fn239_ref\">239</a> but it is not exclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, rule 53 does not terminate or modify the district court's inherent equitable power to appoint a person, whatever be his title, to assist it in administering a remedy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn240\" id=\"fn240_ref\">240</a>  The power of a federal court to appoint an agent to supervise the implementation of its decrees has long been established.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn241\" id=\"fn241_ref\">241</a>  Such court-appointed agents have been identified by \"a confusing plethora of titles: 'receiver,' 'Master,' 'Special Master,' 'master hearing officer,' 'monitor,' 'human rights committee,' 'Ombudsman,' \" and others.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn242\" id=\"fn242_ref\">242</a>  The function is clear, whatever the title.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's opinion stated the reasons for the appointment of the special master and his monitors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn243\" id=\"fn243_ref\">243</a>  As it noted, we have previously approved the appointment of such agents to oversee compliance with continuing court orders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn244\" id=\"fn244_ref\">244</a>  Insofar as the special master is to report on TDC's compliance with the district court's decree and to help implement the decree, he assumes one of the plaintiffs' traditional roles, except that, because he is the court's agent, he can and should perform his duties objectively.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn245\" id=\"fn245_ref\">245</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its order of reference, the district court describes the special master's duties as entailing \"enormous responsibilities.\"  The decree affects twenty-two TDC units, with a staff of more than 3,000 and housing more than 33,000 inmates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn246\" id=\"fn246_ref\">246</a>  The scope and complexity of the decree and the importance as well as the difficulty of ensuring compliance gave the court adequate reason to invoke its implied authority as a court of equity.  Therefore we affirm the district court's decision to appoint the special master and his monitors to observe and report on TDC's compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The special master is also given powers that are quasijudicial.  He is permitted to hold hearings and is directed to find facts \"concerning the defendants' compliance with the provisions of the Court's Orders and the need, if any, for supplemental remedial action.\"  The order also establishes rules of procedure: the monitors are to make reports of factual observations and to submit them to the special master and the parties.  If any party objects, the special master is to hold a hearing, then make his report to the district court.  No objection may be filed to the special master's report that could have been filed to the monitor's report preceding it.  The special master's findings of fact are to be accepted by the court unless clearly erroneous.  In addition, the special master may hold hearings sua sponte without a preliminary monitor's report; and in such instances factual findings in his reports are to be credited unless clearly erroneous.  He may, moreover, submit reports based on his own observations and investigations without conducting a hearing.  The order of reference does not distinguish between the credit to be given such reports and those submitted after hearings and accompanied by an evidentiary record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To fulfill his responsibilities, the special master is given sweeping powers, including \"unlimited access\" to TDC premises and records as well as the power to conduct \"confidential interviews\" with TDC staff members and inmates, and to require written reports from any TDC staff member.  These powers are unconfined save by the following instructions: he is not to intervene in the administrative management of either TDC or any of its units and he is not to direct the defendants or any of their subordinates to take or to refrain from taking any specific action to achieve compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order of reference does not make clear that, in conducting investigations and hearings, the special master and the monitors are not to consider matters that go beyond superintending compliance with the district court's decree.  Such an express constraint is appropriate because of the danger that the special master or the monitors may entertain inmate complaints that convert the remedial process into a surrogate forum for new &#167; 1983 actions.  In the interests both of prison administration and sound judicial procedure, it should be made clear to the plaintiffs, the special master, the monitors, and the TDC staff that the special master is not an inmate advocate or a roving federal district court.  As we have pointed out before,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn247\" id=\"fn247_ref\">247</a> the powers of the court's appointed agents should not intrude to an unnecessary extent on prison administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In one respect, the order of reference is too sweeping.  It permits the special master to submit to the district court \"reports based upon his own observations and investigations in the absence of a formal hearing before him.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn248\" id=\"fn248_ref\">248</a>  This not only transcends the powers traditionally given masters by courts of equity, but denies the parties due process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn249\" id=\"fn249_ref\">249</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the order of reference shall be amended as follows: (1) it should be made clear that the special master and the monitors do not have the authority to hear matters that should appropriately be the subject of separate judicial proceedings, such as actions under &#167; 1983, and that their duties are restricted to those set forth in the order of reference; and (2) unless based on hearings conducted on the record after proper notice, the reports, findings, and conclusions of the special master are not to be accorded any presumption of correctness and the \"clearly erroneous\" rule will not apply to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the reduction in the scope of the district court's decree directed by this opinion should occasion further inquiry by the district court to determine whether or not there is a continuing need for a staff of six monitors to assist the special master.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">X. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Constitution is a charter for all officials, federal and state.  All those who wield the power of the sovereign must be equally obedient to its commands and faithful in ensuring its protections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn250\" id=\"fn250_ref\">250</a>  They take the same oath we do-to uphold and to defend it.<sup>251</sup></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judicial determination has been made.  The reparative injunction will require time, skill, and intensive effort.  The district court and its special master must respect the right of the state to administer its own affairs so long as it does not violate the Constitution.  The state must equally recognize the duty of the district court and the special master as its agent to ensure the restoration of constitutional conditions of confinement in TDC.  The implementation of the district court's decree can become a ceaseless guerrilla war, with endless hearings, opinions, and appeals, and incalculable costs.  But it is instead to be hoped that, if the state adopts the policy that inmates must be accorded their constitutional rights and that prison officials will not be permitted to indulge in petty practices designed to deny those rights, the period of judicial supervision can more speedily be concluded.  To this end, it may not be inappropriate to include the exhortation that constitutional peace is the consummation devoutly to be wished as a result of Ruiz VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">XI. SUMMARY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p>11.1 Uncontested, Settled, and Moot Provisions of the District Court's Decree</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) TDC has not appealed the following provisions of the decree: Parts I(C) (quadruple-celling), I(D) (triple-celling), II(C) (use of physical force), IV(A) (disciplinary practices and procedures), IV(C)(1) (in part) (recreation opportunities for inmates on Death Row), IV(C)(2) (triple-celling in administrative segregation), IV(D) (vague rules), IX(B)-(D) (specific reporting requirements), and X (attorneys' fees and costs).  Thus TDC is deemed to have waived any objections to these provisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn252\" id=\"fn252_ref\">252</a>  They are, therefore, AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) TDC and the plaintiffs have agreed on, and the district court has approved, a modification of Parts II(A) (security staff hiring and deployment patterns) and II(D) (elimination of building tenders) of the decree.  TDC has, therefore, moved, under Fed.R.App.P. 42(b), for dismissal of the portion of its appeal relating to Parts II(A) and II(D) of the decree.

The Defendants have entered into such agreement with the express understanding that their agreement is not an admission of liability in any sense, and particularly is not an admission of bad faith.  Further, Defendants expressly make it known that in their view the agreement hereafter set out in some respects goes beyond minimal, constitutional requirements, but they have entered into said agreement in a good faith effort to terminate this litigation in the areas covered by the agreement and to preclude the need for appeal as to such areas.  Defendants, however, in executing this agreement expressly reserve the right to withdraw their consent thereto as to any part of this agreement which is not incorporated in the form hereafter set out in the final Order of the Court to be entered for the purpose of effectuating said agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The major areas covered by this Decree are in full and complete compromise and settlement of any and all claims regarding such areas and, if Defendants fully comply with the provisions of this Decree, Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervenor agree that neither will request any further relief from the Court on any of these areas except (1) as to the status of the Huntsville Hospital facility and conditions of administrative segregation confinement (extent of recreation; number of prisoners in administrative segregation cells and prohibition of routine use of administrative segregation pending disciplinary hearings) and (2) past, present and future individual claims of class members.  Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervenor agree that enforcement of this Decree will be limited to appropriate motions to effectuate the provisions of this Decree.  No additional requirements beyond those expressly stated in the Decree will be requested of the Court except to the extent necessary to enforce the provisions of this Decree.  Construction of the Decree will be governed by the ordinary and reasonable interpretation of the language therein so as to preclude any strained interpretation, the effect of which is to incorporate standards or relief beyond that agreed to in the Decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, upon the Stipulation of the parties, dated as of February 10, 1981, Defendants, their successors, agents and employees (referred to collectively as \"Defendants\") are hereby ENJOINED as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

Term of Solitary Confinement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants shall not confine any prisoner to more than one fifteen-day term in solitary confinement without holding a hearing conforming to the requirements of due process procedures which are applicable to prison disciplinary proceedings for each term in solitary confinement beyond the initial term.  Consecutive disciplinary punishments are permitted only for violations arising from totally separate incidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Further, the standards shall limit the use of chemical agents to the minimum necessary to prevent escape or imminent serious personal injury or property damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. WORK SAFETY AND HYGIENE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p224\">\n      <span class=\"num\">224</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By September 1, 1981, Defendants shall file with the Court a proposed work safety and hygiene plan prepared with the assistance of personnel from the United States Bureau of Prisons.

DEVELOPMENT AND FILING OF PLANS: SPECIAL MASTER</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p230\">\n      <span class=\"num\">230</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As required by the Court's Order of December 12, 1980, in developing the plans required by this Decree, Defendants shall address the relevant facts and conclusions contained in the Court's Memorandum Opinion of December 12, 1980.  The parties understand that, by entering into the Consent Decree, there has been no agreement whether a Special Master will be appointed, or as to the role of a Special Master, including whether the agreements in this Consent Decree will be part of the reference to a Special Master.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p231\">\n      <span class=\"num\">231</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SIGNED and ENTERED this 3rd day of March, 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p232\">\n      <span class=\"num\">232</span>\n      <p>(s) Wm. Wayne Justice</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Chief Judge</p>\n    <p>United States District Court</p>\n    <p>Eastern District of Texas</p>\n    <p>Judge Presiding</p>\n    <p>AMENDED ORDER OF REFERENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p233\">\n      <span class=\"num\">233</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court, having discovered an error in the text of the Order entered on June 18, 1981, modifying its earlier Order of April 20, 1981, appointing a Special Master in this cause, hereby issues this Amended Order of Reference which shall supersede the aforementioned previous Orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p234\">\n      <span class=\"num\">234</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a Memorandum Opinion filed on December 10, 1980, the Court announced its intention to appoint one or more Special Masters in this cause.  Subsequently, the Court received nominations from all parties and reviewed at length the qualifications of those persons whose names were submitted for consideration.  For the reasons set forth in its earlier opinion, the Court hereby appoints Vincent M. Nathan to serve as Special Master for the Court in this cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p235\">\n      <span class=\"num\">235</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Nathan was nominated both by the plaintiffs and by the United States of America.  A native Texan, he graduated from the University of Oklahoma College of Law in 1959.  He was a member of the faculty of the College of Law of the University of Toledo for 16 years, during the last 10 of which he served as a Professor of Law.  He is now engaged in the practice of law in Toledo, Ohio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p236\">\n      <span class=\"num\">236</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Nathan was appointed in December of 1975 by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio to serve as Special Master in Taylor v. Perini, litigation involving the Marion Correctional Institution in Marion, Ohio.  In January of 1977, Mr. Nathan was appointed by the same court to serve as Special Master in Jones v. Wittenburg (440 F.Supp. 60), litigation involving the Lucas County Jail in Toledo, Ohio.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2\" id=\"fn1-2_ref\">1</a>  In June of 1979 Mr. Nathan was appointed by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia to serve as Special Monitor in Guthrie v. Evans, litigation involving the Georgia State Prison in Reidsville, Georgia.  He continues to serve that court as special monitor at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p237\">\n      <span class=\"num\">237</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Nathan is the author of The Use of Masters in Institutional Reform Litigation, 10 Tol.L.Rev. 419 (1979), which was republished and distributed by the Federal Judicial Center.  He has served and continues to serve as a consultant for the National Institute of Corrections and is an acknowledged expert in the field of implementation of judicial decrees in a correctional setting.  In view of his extensive experience and impressive credentials, Mr. Nathan is fully qualified to assume the enormous responsibilities of monitoring compliance with the Court's order in this cause.  Because the scope of application of the Court's remedial orders in this case will be infinitely broader than that encountered in any other example of correctional litigation, it is essential that the Special Master be a person with extensive experience and an established record of success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p238\">\n      <span class=\"num\">238</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Court will appoint several monitors to assist the Special Master.  These monitors will be persons of high professional qualification who are nominated by the Special Master.  The Special Master shall supervise the activities of such monitors in accordance with the guidelines announced in Newman v. Alabama, 559 F.2d 283, 290 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, (438 U.S. 915) 98 S.Ct. 3144 (57 L.Ed.2d 1160) (1978).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-2\" id=\"fn2-2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p239\">\n      <span class=\"num\">239</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court grounds its appointment of a Special Master in this case upon two independent sources of authority.  First, it relies upon its inherent power to make such an appointment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p240\">\n      <span class=\"num\">240</span>\n      <p>Courts have (at least in the absence of legislation to the contrary) inherent power to provide themselves with appropriate instruments required for the performance of their duties...  This power includes authority to appoint persons unconnected with the court to aid judges in the performance of specific judicial duties, as they may arise in the progress of a cause.  From the commencement of our Government, it has been exercised by the federal courts, when sitting in equity, by appointing, either with or without the consent of the parties, special masters, auditors, examiners and commissioners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p241\">\n      <span class=\"num\">241</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ex parte Peterson, 253 U.S. 300 (40 S.Ct. 543, 64 L.Ed. 919) (1920).  The enforcement of its remedial order is a judicial duty which rests with this Court, and it has the inherent power to appoint a Special Master to provide assistance toward this end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p242\">\n      <span class=\"num\">242</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Court relies upon Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in making this reference.  In its Memorandum Opinion of December 10, 1980, referred to above, the Court has demonstrated that the appointment of a Master is both necessary and appropriate in accordance with the provisions of Rule 53.  The formal fact finding role contemplated by the Rule will be particularly relevant to the Special Master in this case to the extent that he may hold hearings and make factual findings as a result of those hearings for review by the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p243\">\n      <span class=\"num\">243</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to these bases of authority, the Special Master shall assist the Court by monitoring compliance with the Court's orders in this cause.  All actions of the Special Master and any monitors or members of the Special Master's staff will be under the direct control and supervision of the Court.  In particular, the Special Master and other persons operating on the Court's behalf shall not intervene in the administrative management of the Texas Department of Corrections or any of its institutions.  In addition, the Special Master, his staff and any monitors who are appointed shall not be empowered to direct the defendants or any of their subordinates to take or to refrain from taking any specific action to achieve compliance.  The sole power to direct compliance and to punish noncompliance remains with this Court.  The duties of the Special Master, then, will be to observe, monitor, find facts, report or testify as to his findings, and make recommendations to the Court concerning steps which should be taken to achieve compliance.  The Special Master may and should assist the defendants in every possible way, and to this end he may and should confer informally with the defendants and their subordinates on matters affecting compliance.  In order to accomplish these objectives, the Special Master shall have the following powers:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p244\">\n      <span class=\"num\">244</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  The Special Master shall have unlimited access to any facilities, buildings, or premises under the jurisdiction or control of the Texas Department of Corrections, and no advance notice of any visit or inspection shall be required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p245\">\n      <span class=\"num\">245</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Special Master shall have unlimited access to the records, files and papers maintained by the Texas Department of Corrections to the extent that such access is related to the performance of the Special Master's duties of monitoring compliance.  Such access shall include all Departmental, institutional, and inmate records, including but not limited to medical records.  The Special Master may obtain copies of all such relevant records, files and papers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p246\">\n      <span class=\"num\">246</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The Special Master may conduct confidential interviews with all staff members and employees of the Texas Department of Corrections.  In addition, he may engage in informal conferences with such staff members and employees, and such persons shall cooperate with the Special Master and respond to all inquiries and requests related to compliance with the Court's orders in this case.  The Special Master may require compilation and communication of oral or written information relevant to such compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p247\">\n      <span class=\"num\">247</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The Special Master may conduct confidential interviews and meetings at the institution to which they are confined with any prisoner or group of prisoners under the jurisdiction of the Texas Department of Corrections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p248\">\n      <span class=\"num\">248</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The Special Master may attend any formal institutional meetings or proceedings at any institution under the jurisdiction of the Texas Department of Corrections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p249\">\n      <span class=\"num\">249</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. The Special Master may require written reports from any staff member or employee of the Texas Department of Corrections with respect to compliance with this Court's orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p250\">\n      <span class=\"num\">250</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. The Special Master shall have the full power to order and conduct hearings with respect to the defendants' compliance with this Court's orders.  To this end he shall have the power to require the attendance of witnesses, including both prisoners and employees of the Texas Department of Corrections, and he shall exercise all other powers described in subsection (c) of Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p251\">\n      <span class=\"num\">251</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8. The Special Master may select and employ necessary administrative, clerical, and support staff.  All such persons as well as the nature of their compensation shall be approved by the Court in advance of their employment.  In addition, with advance permission of the Court, the Special Master may hire independent specialists and experts to assist him in fulfilling the responsibilities assigned to him by this Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p252\">\n      <span class=\"num\">252</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. In exercising the powers enumerated in paragraphs 1 through 6 above, the Special Master may act by himself, or through monitors appointed by the Court.  All actions of such monitors, however, shall be supervised and coordinated by the Special Master in order to accomplish the objectives of this Reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p253\">\n      <span class=\"num\">253</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Special Master shall, as he deems necessary or as required by the Court, file reports with the Court in which he shall make findings concerning the defendants' compliance with the provisions of the Court's Orders and the need, if any, for supplemental remedial action.  In general, the Special Master's reports to the Court will be based upon reports prepared by individual monitors appointed by the Court as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p254\">\n      <span class=\"num\">254</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Reports of their factual observations shall be prepared by the monitors appointed by the Court and shall be submitted to the parties and to the Special Master.  Any objections to such a report shall be the subject of a hearing before the Special Master upon request of any party.  After the parties have had an opportunity to respond or object to a monitor's report, with or without a hearing, the Special Master shall file his report with the Court, including his findings of fact based upon the monitor's report, the record of any hearing, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p255\">\n      <span class=\"num\">255</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. No objection may be filed to the Special Master's report which could have been filed to the monitor's report preceding it.  Otherwise, any party may file written objections to the Special Master's report within fifteen days of the filing thereof with the Court.  The objecting party shall note each particular finding or recommendation to which objection is made, shall provide proposed alternative findings, and may request a hearing or oral argument before the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p256\">\n      <span class=\"num\">256</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Any request for a hearing before the Court must include a list of witnesses and documents to be presented to the Court.  A copy of the objections, proposed findings, and any request for a rehearing shall be served on all parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p257\">\n      <span class=\"num\">257</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The Special Master's findings of fact shall be accepted by the Court unless shown to be clearly erroneous.  Any evidence not previously presented to the Special Master in the course of the formal hearing preceding his report will be admitted at a hearing before the Court only upon a showing that the party offering it lacked a reasonable opportunity to present the evidence to the Special Master.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p258\">\n      <span class=\"num\">258</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Special Master may submit reports based upon hearings held by him in the absence of preliminary reports by monitors, and in such instances the Special Master's reports and findings shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The Special Master may also submit reports based upon his own observations and investigations in the absence of a formal hearing before him.  In any event, however, the Special Master's findings must be based upon evidence which is made part of the record before the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p259\">\n      <span class=\"num\">259</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Special Master shall be compensated at the rate of Ninety-Five Dollars ($95.00) per hour for services performed in accordance with this Order.

Plainly, any alteration of a court's remedial order, suggested by the parties, is subject to approval by the court.  Moreover, since this action is a class action, the notice provisions of Rule 23(e), F.R.Civ.P., requires that all class members be notified of the proposed settlement, and that they be given an opportunity to object to its terms.  At the close of the hearing on April 14, 1982, the proposed settlement was accepted for review by the court; additionally, the parties were directed to submit to the court a jointly prepared form of notice to the class, and a proposal as to how such notice should be published.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p267\">\n      <span class=\"num\">267</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an order entered April 21, 1982, preliminary approval was given to the settlement.  The terms of the modification are fair and reasonable, and protect, in all respects, the rights of the plaintiff class.  As indicated in the order of April 21, a just settlement of the issues involved in the stipulated modification is in the best interests of all parties to this action, not only with respect to these particular issues, but more generally regarding the entire remedial phase of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p268\">\n      <span class=\"num\">268</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order of April 21 also approved a form of notice to the class, as well as a proposed method of publication.  Under the terms of this notice, the members were thoroughly apprised of the content of the settlement, and were given an opportunity to challenge its terms, by means of written objections.  Class members were directed to file their objections with the clerk of the court, and provide copies to counsel for all parties, and to the Special Master.  A hearing was held on June 1, 1982, in Houston, Texas, for the purpose of considering any objections to the proposed settlement filed by members of the plaintiff class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p269\">\n      <span class=\"num\">269</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Numerous inmates filed objections to the stipulated modification of Sections II(A) and II(D) of the Amended Decree.  The objections raise serious concerns which merit close attention.  With one notable exception, the central thread of the objections is skepticism about defendants' willingness to comply with the terms of the settlement.  In view of the history of this litigation, this skepticism is fully understandable.  However, as with all portions of the injunctive order in this action, defendants' compliance with the terms of the stipulation will be closely monitored.  The Stipulated Modification contains elaborate provisions for ensuring enforcement of its terms.  The court is satisfied that this procedure adequately protects the rights of the plaintiff class.  Should evidence of noncompliance with the terms of the stipulation be called to the attention of the court, appropriate remedial action will be taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p270\">\n      <span class=\"num\">270</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One objection filed by a member of the plaintiff class deserves special comment.  Originally, notice of the proposed settlement was provided to plaintiff class only in English.  Consequently, Spanish-speaking inmates were severely limited in their ability to review and comment on the terms of the settlement.  To cure this shortcoming, the parties were directed to arrange for publication of notice in Spanish.  Such arrangements were made forthwith, and the court is satisfied that all inmates of the Texas Department of Corrections have been adequately notified of the settlement.  Giving consideration to the highly acute and sophisticated objections previously made by many of the members of the plaintiff class, it appears extremely unlikely that any meritorious objections not previously raised will be advanced.  Thus, on the basis of the arguments and evidence adduced at the hearing, it appears that the stipulated modification of Section II(A) and II(D) of the Amended Decree should be finally approved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p271\">\n      <span class=\"num\">271</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This action has been remanded temporarily to the district court from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to permit a hearing as to the approval and entry of the stipulated modification of the Amended Decree vel non.  It appears from the order of remand that entry of final approval will automatically re-vest jurisdiction over the appeal in the Court of Appeals.  Nevertheless, the parties are directed to notify the Clerk of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the present order has been entered and to furnish him with a complete record in this matter, including all pleadings and orders relating thereto.  The parties are further directed to take any action necessary to insure this action is reinstated in that court.  Finally, defendants are directed, in accordance with Section XIV.A of the Stipulated Modification, to file in the Court of Appeals a motion for voluntary dismissal of the portion of their appeal relating to Sections II(A) and II(D) of the Amended Decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p272\">\n      <span class=\"num\">272</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p273\">\n      <span class=\"num\">273</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SIGNED and ENTERED this 1st day of June, 1982.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p274\">\n      <span class=\"num\">274</span>\n      <p>(s) Wm.

TDC contends that the burdens imposed on it were \"far more onerous than the mere guidelines imposed on the United States.\"  In support of this contention, it does not compare what the district judge exacted of each of these parties, but rather contrasts TDC's \"Trial Outline and Supplemental summaries of defense witness testimony\" with a compendium of trial outlines furnished by the United States.  However, the United States also furnished additional material, permitting TDC to photocopy the United States' witness files, some 30,000 pages</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn33\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33_ref\">33</a>\n        <p> To support its contention, TDC points to one instance in which, over the United States' claim of \"surprise,\" the district judge admitted TDC's evidence and said he would give it minimal weight, and also to four times when he excluded TDC's proffered evidence on the ground of surprise.  TDC points with suspicion to the district judge's praise of the United States for opening its files to TDC, and to five instances in which the district judge was presumably partial to the United States because he permitted the United States' witness to testify after only fragmentary pretrial disclosure of his expected testimony</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn34\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34_ref\">34</a>\n        <p> In the appendix to the briefs, TDC has mustered every episode of what it considers to be the district judge's hostility toward TDC's witnesses and his alleged contemporaneous and unfair solicitude for the plaintiffs' witnesses.  It points out that he admonished three-quarters of TDC's witnesses not to disclose their testimony to other witnesses, but similarly admonished less than one-third of the plaintiffs' witnesses.  He thrice warned TDC's witnesses of the consequences of perjury or contempt of court.  He once prohibited TDC's counsel from reminding adverse witnesses that they were under oath.

We note, however, that in each case he did this only after first warning counsel, in some instances repeatedly, that the duration of cross-examination was far exceeding the amount of time taken on direct examination.

Ray, --- F.2d ---- (9th Cir. 1982), read Rhodes as rejecting \"the totality\" test.  The Hoptowit court said:</p>\n        <p>In assessing claims of Eighth Amendment violations, and equally importantly, in tailoring a proper remedy, we must analyze each claimed violation in light of these requirements (i.e., \"discrete areas of basic human needs\").  Courts may not find Eighth Amendment violations based on the \"totality of conditions\" at a prison.</p>\n        <p>Id. at ----.</p>\n        <p>However, the court later observed:</p>\n        <p>As we have said, however, \"(E)ach condition of confinement does not exist in isolation; the court must consider the effect of each condition in the context of the prison environment, especially when the ill-effects of particular conditions are exacerbated by other related conditions.\"  (Wright v. Rushen, 642 F.2d 1129, 1133 (9th Cir. 1981) ).  This is no more than a recognition that a particular violation may be the result of several contributing factors.  \"But the court's principal focus must be on specific conditions of confinement.  It may not use the totality of all conditions to justify federal intervention requiring remedies more extensive than are required to correct Eighth Amendment violations.\"  (Wright v. Rushen, 642 F.2d at 1133.)  To find an Eighth Amendment violation, courts must identify specific conditions that fail to meet Eighth Amendment requirements.  We cannot rely on a vague conclusion that the \"totality of conditions\" violates the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n        <p>Id. at ----; see id. at ----.</p>\n        <p>Hoptowit thus seems to us to say that conditions of confinement that in some circumstances would not be cruel and unusual may in other circumstances, when combined with other conditions, rise to that level.  We agree with the Hoptowit court's conclusion that a generalized and \"vague conclusion\" concerning the totality of conditions is insufficient.</p>\n        <p>TDC also argues that, \"(i)n light of Rhodes, the Ninth Circuit reiterated its condemnation of the 'totality of conditions' approach in Wright v.

Concluding, however, that the district court inappropriately considered state law claims not raised by the parties, we reverse its order that TDC conform its practices to state statutory requirements.  We also conclude that some of the remedial measures ordered are not demonstrably required to protect constitutional rights and intrude unduly on matters of state concern and we, therefore, narrow the scope of the relief ordered.  An outline of our lengthy opinion is set forth in the margin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. INTRODUCTORY FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Texas state prison system, operated by TDC, is the largest in the United States.  Its inmates, now numbering more than 33,000, are confined in cells or dormitories located in twenty-two separate units, almost all of which have maximum security.  Most of the approximately 10,000 cells measure nine feet by five feet, but some are as large as sixty-six square feet.  Most of the dormitories house large numbers of inmates and are crowded.  After the consolidation of eight separate actions by individual inmates against W. J. Estelle, the Director of TDC, challenging the conditions of their confinement, the district court certified the case as a class action and permitted the United States to intervene as a plaintiff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial began in Houston on October 2, 1978, and, after 159 days of trial, bridging a three-month recess, was completed on September 20, 1979.  Three hundred forty-nine witnesses testified and 1,565 exhibits were received into evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  The district court issued a 118-page memorandum opinion on December 12, 1980, indicating generally the relief it proposed to grant, and gave the parties an opportunity to agree on a proposed judgment.  The parties later filed a proposed consent decree disposing of many of the issues.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The district court approved this consent decree, entered a decree granting equitable relief and a declaratory judgment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> on the issues not disposed of by the consent decree, appointed a special master to monitor implementation of the relief ordered,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and denied TDC's motion for a stay.  TDC then applied to this court for a stay, which we granted in part and denied in part.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  TDC later sought a supplemental stay, which, again, we granted in part and denied in part.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  The parties then agreed to a second consent decree that modified parts of the district court's decree, and we remanded the case to enable the district court to hold a class action hearing on the proposed modifications.  After that hearing, the district court approved the second consent decree<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> and, in accordance with its terms, TDC moved under Fed.R.App.P. 42(b) for voluntary dismissal of its appeal of the provisions of the district court's decree<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> that were superseded by the second consent decree.  The case has also been before us on interlocutory appeals; this marks its seventh appearance in our court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the pervasive issues still contested: TDC's attack on the fairness of the trial, the sufficiency of the district court's findings of fact, the intervention by the United States, and the joinder of the Texas Board of Corrections and individual members of the Board as parties defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. FAIRNESS OF THE TRIAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TDC contends that the district judge made many errors in his rulings concerning the conduct of the trial and the admissibility of evidence, the cumulative effect of which was so prejudicial as to deny TDC its right to a fair trial.  The impugnment is more than a challenge to specific rulings, however, for it includes assertions that \"the entire record is permeated with favoritism\" toward the plaintiffs and \"unrelenting unfairness\" toward TDC and is infected both by \"evident prejudgment\" of the case in the plaintiffs' favor and by judicial bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional guarantee of due process of law ordains a fair trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  The trial judge must not become \"personally embroiled\" in the proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  He must not assume the role of prosecutor<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> or defender.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  He must avoid even the appearance of favoring one side.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  However, \"(o)nly when the judge's conduct strays from neutrality is a defendant thereby denied a fair trial as required by the Constitution.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  Moreover, even if the trial judge does commit error, it is presumed harmless until shown to be prejudicial.  The complaining party must prove that the error was substantial and that it prejudiced his case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the trial judge must be neutral, he should not be a passive spectator.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  \"He is a common law judge having that authority historically exercised by judges in the common law process,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> and not simply come but to say, \"sustained,\" or \"overruled.\"  He may, when in his sound discretion he deems it advisable, comment on the evidence, question witnesses, elicit facts not yet adduced or clarify those previously presented, and maintain the pace of the trial by interrupting or setting time limits on counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  He must not usurp the role of counsel, but he may manage the trial's course to achieve a \"just, speedy, and inexpensive determination\" of the action.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  Obviously he has greater latitude in conducting a bench trial, for then it is his duty to determine the facts, and his conduct cannot influence jurors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  In complex and protracted trials like this one, the trial judge must assume even greater responsibility for the direction of the trial than he undertakes in short and simple ones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pretrial discovery in this case was exhaustive, the district judge required complete pretrial disclosure of expected testimony, and he limited to some degree the length of cross-examination of a number of witnesses.  The trial nevertheless lasted almost a full year.  After the plaintiffs had presented all of their witnesses and the United States, as plaintiff-intervenor, had presented most of its witnesses, there was a three-month recess, ample time for TDC to prepare refutation and rebuttal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a>  All of these factors, together with the fact that the judge was the factfinder, must be considered in evaluating TDC's contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conduct of the district judge is attacked with a barrage of charges.  TDC contends that his pretrial orders were more exacting of TDC than of the other parties,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> and that during pretrial proceedings he was partial to the plaintiffs in many respects.  TDC also contends that he excluded much of TDC's evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> treated TDC's witnesses unfairly in comparison with the treatment accorded the plaintiffs' witnesses,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> and improperly limited TDC's cross-examinations and rebuttals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> TDC contends generally that the record is \"permeated with favoritism.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the full record of the lengthy trial, we find little probative value in the excluded evidence, and no prejudice in the district judge's rulings.  TDC has not pointed to a single instance of the exclusion of defense testimony that was not either repetitive or insignificant in probative value.  Error cannot be predicated on an evidentiary ruling unless a substantial right of the objecting party is affected.  Fed.R.Evid. 103(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a>  The district judge was required to make literally thousands of decisions on evidentiary issues, usually without advance notice, memoranda from counsel, or opportunity for independent research.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>  In deciding such matters, trial judges are not expected to be either infallible or clairvoyant.  The rules of evidence exact only the attainable, the avoidance of error that is prejudicial and affects a substantial right.  This standard was fully met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One time the district judge showed plaintiffs' counsel how to lay a foundation for testimony and four times he relieved a plaintiffs' lawyer who was having difficulty laying a predicate by asking the necessary questions himself.  Doubtless the floundering lawyer eventually could have satisfied the formalities of each objection.  Doubtless the need to conform to proper procedure gave the lawyer good, albeit embarrassing, experience.  We see no reason, however, why the district judge should have further protracted the trial by requiring the lawyer eventually to master each difficulty alone, for there was no jury to be affected, and the judge himself could deftly cut what was only a technical knot and expedite the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge did credit the testimony of the plaintiffs' witnesses more frequently than that of TDC's witnesses, but in a bench trial the assessment of witness credibility is inherently his province.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a>  We are especially reluctant to set aside findings that are based upon a trial judge's determination of the credibility of witnesses giving contradictory accounts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither any one episode pointed out in the briefs nor the weight of all of them cumulatively demonstrates that the trial was unfair.  At the outset, the trial judge granted TDC's motion for a six-month postponement of the trial date.  At TDC's motion, and for TDC's convenience, he changed the venue of the trial.  After the plaintiffs and the United States had rested, he gave TDC three months to prepare its defense.  He struck the testimony of the plaintiffs' witness who was shown to have violated the nondiscussion rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond either human capacity or the demands of justice that the trial judge decide correctly every issue arising in the trial.  What is required is not a perfect score, but fairness, probity, and the avoidance of substantial prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first and second consent decrees settled many of the controverted issues, to which much of the trial testimony was devoted.  On the matters covered by the consent decrees, their provisions were substantially the same as the remedies outlined by the district judge in his opinion.  In addition, TDC does not contest many of the provisions of the district court's decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a>  Although this acquiescence is in no sense fatal to TDC's claims, it does indicate that TDC in effect concedes the correctness of many provisions in the district court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge's rulings appear to have been based only on what he learned from his seat on the bench and his perception of the evidence.  Any adverse attitudes that he evinced were based on his performance of his judicial duties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a>  The remarks of some lawyers during the trial carry notes of testiness and personal involvement that go beyond mere diligent representation of a client's interests, but the district judge never became personally embroiled in the proceedings and he presided over them patiently and fairly.  We find neither abuse of discretion nor prejudicial error in his conduct of the trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE FINDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying upon the first sentence of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), which requires the district court after a bench trial to \"find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon,\" TDC contends that the district court failed to make findings of fact sufficiently specific for appellate review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge should set forth preliminary and basic facts rather than \"(s)tatements conclusory in nature.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a> Ultimate findings must be specifically supported.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a>  The opinion in this case, as we have already noted, occupies 118 printed pages.  More than half of it is devoted to findings of fact.  Some of the factual recitals are specific.  In deciding other factual issues, the district judge drew inferences concerning general conditions from specific instances.  His findings are not apodictic conclusions of the kind we have found insufficient as a basis for review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a> They are sufficient to give us a \"clear understanding of the analytical process by which ultimate findings were reached and to assure us that the trial court took care in ascertaining the facts.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a>  However convenient it might be for counsel and the appellate court to have \"specific citations to the record,\" the absence of which TDC criticizes, such citations are not required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the findings are sufficient, they were, as our comments suggest, not all made with the same specificity; indeed, the very nature of some of the issues rendered particularity impossible.  The district judge could and did find whether or not a record was made of disciplinary proceedings.  He could and did find whether or not on particular occasions one inmate assaulted another.  From these data he could and did deduce whether or not it had been shown that inmate assaults were so frequent as to create an atmosphere of violence.  That kind of finding, reached by inference from specific data, is both proper and requisite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the data observed are sufficient to warrant a general conclusion must be determined by logic and judgment.  The human events of the past cannot be sampled so perfectly as to permit a statistically valid analysis.  This kind of conclusion is not a mixed question of fact and law or one of legal inferences from the facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a>  It is instead one of the sufficiency of an evidentiary basis for a factual conclusion.  Although that type of conclusion does not rest on the credibility of witnesses or the advantage of firsthand observation, it is equally a question of fact, to be accepted by us unless clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to both kinds of factual conclusions, we find the district judge's opinion sufficient to give us a clear understanding of the views he took of the evidence, the analytical process by which he reached his conclusions, and the basis by which he applied legal principles to these facts.  No more is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. INTERVENTION BY THE UNITED STATES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, acting sua sponte, on April 12, 1974, \"determined that the public interest will be served by the participation of the United States\" and ordered the United States to appear as amicus curiae and to participate in this case \"with the full rights of a party.\"  W. J. Estelle, the Director of TDC, was then the only defendant.  After appearing as amicus curiae, the United States moved in December 1974 to intervene as a party plaintiff under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b)(2), and also sought leave to file a complaint in intervention adding new causes of action, and adding the Texas Board of Corrections and its individual members as additional defendants.  The United States relied upon \"the inherent authority of the United States, through its Attorney General, to sue to remedy severe and widespread deprivations of constitutional rights.\"  The motion was granted ex parte and TDC's later motion to dismiss the United States both as plaintiff-intervenor and as amicus curiae was denied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not the United States had inherent or implied authority to sue or to intervene in suits to protect the constitutional rights of individual citizens at the time the intervention was filed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a> Congress has since enacted the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 1997-1997j (West 1981) (\"the Act\"), which became law on May 23, 1980.  The Act authorizes the Attorney General to initiate, id. &#167;&#167; 1997a-1997b, or intervene in, id. &#167; 1997c, civil actions on behalf of persons confined in specified state institutions, including jails, prisons, and other correctional facilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision unless there is statutory language or legislative history to the contrary, or unless doing so would cause manifest injustice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a>  It must apply that law \"even where (the statute) does not explicitly recite that it is to be applied to pending cases.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a>  The \"law\" at issue in this case is the Act, particularly &#167; 1997c, which deals with intervention by the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That section of the Act comprises two elements: a substantive provision authorizing the Attorney General to intervene in lawsuits, and procedural provisions with which the United States must comply before it may intervene.  Nothing in the Act or its legislative history suggests that we should not apply the substantive provision of &#167; 1997c to this case.  If anything, the legislative history reinforces the presumption that we should apply it.  The Senate Report notes that the Justice Department has intervened in many suits<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a> and expresses approval of such intervention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a>  Moreover, the Senate Report,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a> the dissent from the Senate Report,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a> and the House Conference Report<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fn59_ref\">59</a> all express the view that the United States already had the authority to intervene in such cases, and that the Act merely gave it explicit statutory sanction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fn60_ref\">60</a>  We cannot read this legislative history as expressing hostility to pre-Act intervention by the United States.  To do so would achieve a result at odds with the understanding of both the supporters and the opponents of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a>  We conclude, therefore, that the substantive provision of &#167; 1997c applies in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of the Act does, however, lead us to conclude that we should not apply the procedural provisions of &#167; 1997c in this case.  The Senate Report explicitly states that the Act aims to preclude, inter alia, the possibility that \"suits in which the United States is currently participating as amicus or plaintiff-intervenor will be disrupted by defendant(s') motions to dismiss the United States as a party.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a>  Moreover, in discussing other sections of the Act, the legislative history notes other goals of the Act: making Justice Department resources available in lawsuits challenging the conditions of confinement in state institutions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a> improving the lives of persons confined in state institutions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fn64_ref\">64</a> encouraging state officials to take action to safeguard the rights of these persons,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fn65_ref\">65</a> achieving efficient use of Justice Department resources,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fn66_ref\">66</a> and ensuring \"conservation of judicial resources.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn67\" id=\"fn67_ref\">67</a>  To dismiss the United States at this state in the litigation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn68\" id=\"fn68_ref\">68</a> when it could simply initiate a new lawsuit,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn69\" id=\"fn69_ref\">69</a> and thereby duplicate its previous, massive efforts, would do violence to all of these goals.  We decline to \"cause great disruption by forcing the parties ... to begin anew a case that all parties agree could eventually be decided under the new law.  Congress did not intend the enactment of the new law to cause such tribulation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn70\" id=\"fn70_ref\">70</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, considering the identity of the parties in this case, the nature of their rights, and the impact of the change in law upon those rights,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn71\" id=\"fn71_ref\">71</a> we find that no \"manifest injustice\" results from our application of the Act to this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn72\" id=\"fn72_ref\">72</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court's order permitting intervention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V.

J. Estelle, the Director of TDC, was named as defendant.  In its complaint in intervention, however, the United States also named as defendants the Texas Board of Corrections and its individual members.  Texas law charges the Board of Corrections \"with the exclusive management and control of\" TDC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn73\" id=\"fn73_ref\">73</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This action was initiated under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, which provides that \"(e) very person\" who, under color of law, subjects a citizen to deprivation of his federal rights shall be liable to that citizen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn74\" id=\"fn74_ref\">74</a>  The states' eleventh amendment sovereign immunity bars an action in federal court against a state or a state agency unless the state has consented to suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn75\" id=\"fn75_ref\">75</a>  Congress, in enacting &#167; 1983, did not intend \"to override the traditional sovereign immunity of the states.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn76\" id=\"fn76_ref\">76</a> Thus neither states nor state agencies are \"persons\" within the meaning of &#167; 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn77\" id=\"fn77_ref\">77</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board of Corrections is merely an agency of the state.  It is, therefore, neither a \"person\" nor, consequently, a proper party defendant.  As the United States now concedes, the district court's judgment must be reversed insofar as it casts the Board as a defendant, and the Board, as an entity, must be dismissed from this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn78\" id=\"fn78_ref\">78</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The individual members of the Board, however, are of course persons.  Although the Texas statute vests management of the prison system in the Board, the Board members are responsible as individuals, in the same manner as the Director of TDC, for any violation of constitutional rights caused by their management.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn79\" id=\"fn79_ref\">79</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TDC contends that the Board members are superfluous defendants because the Director of TDC is also a defendant and can respond to any court orders.  The mere fact that one defendant can pay a judgment or effectuate a court order has never been deemed reason to dismiss other persons who are legally responsible to the plaintiff, and TDC cites no authority for the proposition that one amenable defendant suffices.  Accordingly, the joinder of the individual members of the Board was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI.

Double-celling was made necessary by an unanticipated increase in prison population.  It did not lead to deprivations of essential food, medical care, or sanitation.  It did not \"increase violence among inmates or create other conditions intolerable for prison confinement.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn90\" id=\"fn90_ref\">90</a>  It diminished job and educational opportunities only \"marginally.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn91\" id=\"fn91_ref\">91</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court had previously noted other facts.  The cells measured sixty-three square feet.  Each had a cabinet-type night stand and other furnishings.  Double-celling had not reduced significantly the availability of space in the day rooms or visitation rooms, nor had it rendered the library or school facilities inadequate.  There had been no increase in the rate of violence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn92\" id=\"fn92_ref\">92</a>  The ratio of guards to inmates \"satisfied the standard of acceptability\" offered by the inmates' expert witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn93\" id=\"fn93_ref\">93</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This review of the opinion makes it evident that Rhodes v.

Were it necessary to decide only that confining two inmates in a single cell is not cruel and unusual punishment, there would have been no need to describe the general conditions in the prison.  Rhodes holds that the confinement of two persons in one cell is not per se cruel and unusual when, all prison conditions having been considered \"alone or in combination,\" inmates are not deprived of the \"minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn97\" id=\"fn97_ref\">97</a>  This is also the reading that other courts have given to Rhodes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn98\" id=\"fn98_ref\">98</a>  Rhodes does, however, hold that the totality of the conditions of confinement does not offend the Constitution unless prison conditions are cruel and unusual, and not merely harsh or restrictive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These precepts provide the illumination by which we examine those provisions of the district court's decree based on the eighth amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.2 Findings by the District Court</p>\n    <p>6.21 Overcrowding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of trial, TDC confined over 26,000 inmates.  (The inmate population has since increased to over 33,000.)  About 1,000 were sleeping on floors.  (None are now on floors but many are confined in tents.)  In cells measuring forty-five square feet,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn99\" id=\"fn99_ref\">99</a> originally designed for one occupant, TDC confined two to four inmates.  The district court found that assault or molestation by fellow inmates was a continual threat.  It found that the population density of inmates confined in dormitories was \"shocking.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn100\" id=\"fn100_ref\">100</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This overcrowding \"exercises a malignant effect on all aspects of inmate life.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn101\" id=\"fn101_ref\">101</a>  Day rooms designed for recreational purposes must serve double and even triple the number of inmates for which they were planned.  Access to gymnasiums, outdoor playing fields, craft shops, and libraries is even more limited.  Dining rooms are nearly always crowded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn102\" id=\"fn102_ref\">102</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although TDC contends that, because of TDC's \"work ethic,\" inmates spend little of their time in cells or dormitory sleeping areas, in fact inmates spend much of their time in their living quarters.

There was substantial evidence on the record to support the district judge's findings, and we have been given no reason to overturn them, save the inadequate reason that the testimony of others conflicts.

Patently the trial should not and cannot consist of a review either of every assault over a five-year period or of a day in the life of each of the inmates.  The statistics presented are inconclusive.  The homicide rate at TDC is less than in many cities.  The assault rate is less than the rate reported in other prison cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn121\" id=\"fn121_ref\">121</a> but this means only that other prisons are worse.  The guard-inmate ratio is among the lowest in the nation.

As we have pointed out, the constitutional mandate against cruel and unusual punishment is not a warranty of pleasant prison conditions.  Reparative injunctive relief must be targeted at elimination of the unconstitutional conditions.  \"(T)he nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn139\" id=\"fn139_ref\">139</a>  Therefore, a court can order only relief sufficient to correct the violation found.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn140\" id=\"fn140_ref\">140</a>  We have neither commission nor competence to prescribe the purposes of confinement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a matter of respect for the state's role and for the allocation of functions in our federal system, as well as comity toward the state, the relief ordered by federal courts must be \"consistent with the policy of minimum intrusion into the affairs of state prison administration that the Supreme Court has articulated for the federal courts.\"  Ruiz V, 650 F.2d at 571.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn141\" id=\"fn141_ref\">141</a>  \"(T)he principles of federalism which play such an important part in governing the relationship between federal courts and state governments\" are applicable \"where injunctive relief is sought ... against those in charge of an executive branch of an agency of state\" government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn142\" id=\"fn142_ref\">142</a>  We should, therefore, fashion \"the least intrusive remedy that will still be effective.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn143\" id=\"fn143_ref\">143</a>  In shaping that remedy, we must also, as a matter of judicial administration, regard the essential nature of federal courts in an adversary system.

In many respects the decree he shaped is focused directly on steps to remedy the aspects of confinement that together make it cruel and unusual.  In other respects the decree is, as the district court's order of reference to the special master recites, \"infinitely broader than that encountered in any other example of correctional litigation.\"  Considering both the constitutional violations to be excised and the scope of the therapy directed, we are left with the conviction that, without the guidance now provided by Rhodes v. Chapman, the district court adopted some remedies that are not essential for the elimination of unconstitutional prison conditions.  Taken as a whole, the district court's decree administers a massive curative dose when it is not yet demonstrable that a lesser therapeutic measure would not suffice.  Conservative treatment is essential because it is more readily administered, less costly to the state, and not irreversible.  Therefore, the remedy should begin with what is absolutely necessary.  If these measures later prove ineffective, more stringent ones should be considered.  We turn now to the specifics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.51 Overcrowding: Space Requirements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the number of inmates in one cell nor the amount of space provided for an inmate in a dormitory alone determines whether confinement is cruel and unusual.  See Ruiz VI, 666 F.2d at 858.  If an inmate uses his living quarters only for sleeping, and is not threatened with violence, a single bunk space, eighteen or twenty square feet, may be adequate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn145\" id=\"fn145_ref\">145</a>  The district judge found that the crowding of persons, the consequent effect on prison services and facilities, and the lack of security are specific conditions that combine to make confinement at TDC uncivilized and inhumane.  However, we cannot know whether the provision of additional guards and the consequent increase both in inmate security and in work opportunities, the diminished role of building tenders, and the various other remedial measures either incorporated in the consent decrees or approved by us elsewhere in this opinion will sufficiently relieve the conditions that combined to make double-celling cruel and unusual, with the result that confinement of two inmates to one forty-five-foot cell will be only the harshness sanctioned by Rhodes, or whether it will still be cruel and unusual.  Current estimates for maximum security prison cells suggest that their cost ranges from $30,000 to $60,000 apiece.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn146\" id=\"fn146_ref\">146</a>  Approximately 10,000 additional cells would be required to house in a single cell every person now in a double cell less than sixty square feet in area.  These additional cells, therefore, could cost at least $300,000,000 and require three to four years or more to build.  Prisons once built cannot be readily adapted to other governmental uses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Constitutional rights are not, of course, confined to those available at modest cost.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn147\" id=\"fn147_ref\">147</a>  The very concept of federalism, the division of powers among the branches of the federal government, and the nature of the safeguards imposed by the Bill of Rights and the fourteenth amendment levy costs impossible for an accountant to calculate, but esteemed by us because they are literally priceless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet in considering remedies for unconstitutional deprivation, the cost of one proposed remedy in comparison with the cost of others and the demonstrable need for the remedy should both be considered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn148\" id=\"fn148_ref\">148</a>  A remedy imposing great cost on a state should not be ordered unless its constitutional need has been demonstrated.  Although we recognize the great discretion accorded a trial judge in fashioning remedies,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn149\" id=\"fn149_ref\">149</a> the district judge here lacked the guidance of Rhodes v. Chapman and failed to consider the cost of the remedial measures ordered as well as the possibility of achieving constitutional conditions without requiring single-celling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the dormitory space limitation.  Neither sixty square feet, nor forty square feet, nor any other measure is constitutionally ordained.  Yet the facts found serve as adequate basis to require more space for inmates confined in dormitories, not only to ameliorate living conditions but, more important, to enhance security and reduce violence.  An inmate in a cell with one other person is exposed to assault only by that person; an inmate in an overcrowded dormitory having an inadequate security staff may be victimized by many.  Moreover, a forty-square-feet-per-inmate dormitory space requirement will not occasion vast expense.  At present, TDC is, by use of tents, providing forty square feet for most dormitory inmates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn150\" id=\"fn150_ref\">150</a>  Only 128 inmates are confined in dormitories that house more than they would if there were forty square feet per inmate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement of sixty square feet per inmate, however, would necessitate the construction of facilities for 2,831 additional inmates.  If it costs only $10,000 per inmate to construct a dormitory instead of the $30,000 amount used to estimate the cost of constructing cells, the construction of dormitories for these additional inmates would cost almost $30,000,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has not been demonstrated that provision of additional security guards and the other measures required by the district court's decree and the two consent decrees will not remedy the constitutional deficiency.  It appears desirable, therefore, first to undertake measures that will not be both costly and irreversible.  If these measures do not work, then additional ones may be necessary.  This \"wait and see\" approach ensures that the intrusion into state processes will be no greater than that required to achieve compliance with the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we affirm the provisions of the district court's decree that restrict TDC's acceptance of inmates to be housed in dormitories to those inmates who can be accommodated with a space of at least forty square feet.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn151\" id=\"fn151_ref\">151</a>  We vacate the provisions of the decree that require (1) single-celling and (2) sixty square feet per inmate in dormitories.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn152\" id=\"fn152_ref\">152</a>  This is without prejudice to the right of plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor to move for a further hearing, to be held one year after our order becomes effective, to determine whether, despite changes in prison conditions wrought as a result of it, compliance with constitutional requirements requires additional restrictions on inmate capacity.  This is also without prejudice to the correlative right of TDC to seek a relaxation of the decree if TDC can demonstrate that the Constitution does not compel continuance of the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.52 Other Measures To Relieve Overcrowding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mandate that TDC must use good time, parole, and furlough programs to relieve overcrowding unnecessarily invades the management responsibility of state officials.  Moreover, it requires detailed supervision of programs that relate only indirectly to the conditions of confinement.  Directing state officials to achieve specific results should suffice; how they will achieve those results must be left to them unless and until it can be demonstrated judicial intervention is necessary.  They may elect to balance prison population and physical facilities by parole, furloughs, pardons, confinement in county institutions, use of minimum security institutions for some inmates, changes in sentencing policies, or in other ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However inefficient the management of large prisons may be when compared with the administration of smaller ones, and however desirable it may be to locate prisons near large communities, the failure to do either does not cause confinement to be cruel and unusual.  Palaces may be erected in the wilderness.  Large prisons may be impersonal but they are not necessarily inhumane.  There is of course some relationship between the new-facilities provisions of the district court's decree and the amelioration of prison conditions, but the measure of therapeutic effect is patently small.  The effect of these remedial measures does not appear to us sufficient to warrant their economic cost, their intrusion on state decisionmaking, or the supervisory burden that their administration would impose on a federal court.  Therefore, we vacate Parts I(A)(1), I(A)(3)-(6), VII, and VIII of the district court's decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>6.53 Staff Training</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree specifies how correctional officers will be schooled.  If correctional officers are hired and trained, we must assume, until the contrary is shown, that they will be both trained and utilized with some minimal degree of wisdom.  If, after they are employed, it is demonstrated that TDC officials are still violating inmates' constitutional rights, additional steps can then be taken.  Here again, we deem the \"wait and see\" policy, rather than radical surgery, more in keeping with the constitutionally reparative function of the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate Part II(B) of the district court's decree.

Inmates, in many instances lacking adequate training, also serve as laboratory technicians, X-ray technicians, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, first aid attendants, and medical records clerks.  Many of the inmates assigned to these tasks are uneducated and some are illiterate.  The district court found \"numerous\" instances of \"(g)rievous neglect of the personal care of patients at the HUH,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn162\" id=\"fn162_ref\">162</a> but nothing in the findings indicates either that these are imminent in the hospital or that they are not remediable by a larger and better-trained staff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCAH standards are applied to hospitals in Texas by THA.

Moreover, there have been additional developments since the district court issued its decree.  By orders dated October 19, 1981, and November 5, 1981, the district court stayed the provision of its decree pertaining to HUH.  In its October 19 order, the district court directed TDC to file a formal response to particular suggestions made by the plaintiffs concerning HUH.  TDC filed this response.  In the court's November 5 order, TDC's response is described as exhibiting \"a commendable air of conciliation.\"  That order further directs the parties to meet and discuss possible agreement on continued operation of HUH.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the provision of the district court's decree pertaining to the HUH and remand that issue to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion after the district court has received a report concerning the results of the discussion it has ordered.

Whether or not all vestiges of this practice have been eliminated, the injunction that we affirmed in Corpus provides an adequate remedy for it.  The decree in this case, therefore, must be modified to eliminate the duplication.  We do not find the district court's remedy in other respects either disproportionate to the conditions found or unduly intrusive on the state.  Therefore, we affirm Part V of the district court's decree, except for Part V(J), which we vacate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>7.2 Disciplinary Hearings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found a number of violations of inmates' right to due process in the administration of prison discipline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn199\" id=\"fn199_ref\">199</a> Some of these violations have been remedied by the first consent decree; others are addressed in Part IV of the district court's decree.  In this appeal, apart from the provisions dealing with administrative segregation, TDC objects only to a prophylactic provision that requires it to tape record or in some other way make a verbatim record of all disciplinary hearings, preserve the recordings for at least one year, and follow prescribed procedures for making the recordings available to inmates or their legal representatives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn200\" id=\"fn200_ref\">200</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TDC correctly points out that Wolff v. McDonnell holds that the Constitution requires only \"a 'written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons' for the disciplinary action.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn201\" id=\"fn201_ref\">201</a>  It does not require tape recordings.  TDC argues that the possibility that a recording would be released might inhibit the willingness of inmates to testify against other inmates.  It also argues that the existence of recordings creates the possibility of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information by counsel or a TDC employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that TDC had not maintained adequate written records of its disciplinary proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn202\" id=\"fn202_ref\">202</a>  Its decree is aimed directly at preventing any recurrence of that constitutional lapse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn203\" id=\"fn203_ref\">203</a>  Nothing in the decree forbids TDC to take measures to ensure the confidentiality of the recordings.  Indeed the district court took account of security concerns by permitting TDC to exclude from release to an inmate any portion of a recording containing material that was recorded while the inmate \"was excluded from the hearing for security reasons.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-settled that, under the fourteenth amendment, a court may require remedial measures that the Constitution does not of its own force initially require.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn204\" id=\"fn204_ref\">204</a>  Injunctive relief need not be confined to an order to cease an illegal practice.  Once a constitutional violation has been proved, the court may, if necessary, exert its equitable power to prevent repetition of the violation, not only by the force of the contempt sanction but also by commanding measures that safeguard against recurrence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn205\" id=\"fn205_ref\">205</a>  The tape recording provision imposes little expense or inconvenience on TDC, does not change the manner in which state officials discharge their duties, is narrowly focused to prevent repetition of a proved constitutional violation, and is not unnecessarily intrusive on state functions.  The district court did not, therefore, abuse its discretion by imposing this requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VIII.

In their Amended Complaint, the plaintiffs allege that their living and working conditions are \"inadequate and dangerous,\" and that TDC's \"industries and work areas fail to meet applicable minimum health and safety standard(s).\"  These allegations, however, are followed by the assertion that these alleged deficiencies violate the United States Constitution.  The Amended Complaint does not mention Texas law, nor does the Complaint in Intervention filed by the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn207\" id=\"fn207_ref\">207</a>  Like the Amended Complaint, the Complaint in Intervention asserts that various alleged deficiencies in the living and working conditions at TDC violate the United States Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the lengthy trial was completed, the district court directed the parties to brief the applicability of various Texas health and safety statutes.  Although TDC contends that these statutes do not apply to state agencies, the district court held that they apply to TDC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn208\" id=\"fn208_ref\">208</a>  It then concluded that enforcement of these statutes would remedy the harmful conditions it found and that, therefore, it was unnecessary to decide the constitutional claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn209\" id=\"fn209_ref\">209</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs defend the district court's disposition as the least intrusive means of dealing with these conditions, and as an appropriate exercise of the court's power and discretion under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction.  Their argument blends two distinct doctrines: pendent jurisdiction over state law claims and judicial self-restraint to avoid deciding issues on constitutional grounds when they can be decided on some other basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn210\" id=\"fn210_ref\">210</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts are necessarily confined to the limited jurisdiction granted by article III and by act of Congress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn211\" id=\"fn211_ref\">211</a> However, the Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution does not prohibit the assertion of state law claims that form a separate but parallel ground for relief also sought in a substantial claim based on federal law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn212\" id=\"fn212_ref\">212</a>  The trial court's jurisdiction over state law claims is ultimately a question of judicial power under the Constitution.

These factors would militate against the exercise of pendent jurisdiction even if the plaintiffs, and not the court, had invoked it at that belated time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn223\" id=\"fn223_ref\">223</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exercise of pendent jurisdiction is an expansive act, permitting disposition in one suit of both state and federal claims.  Avoiding decision of federal constitutional claims is, by contrast, an act of judicial self-restraint.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly declared that it will decide federal constitutional issues only if necessarily compelled to do so in order to decide a case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn224\" id=\"fn224_ref\">224</a>  If possible, it will avoid deciding such issues by deciding instead a dispositive, pendent state law claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn225\" id=\"fn225_ref\">225</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concept that a federal trial court may of its own volition, after trial, consider state law claims not pleaded by the plaintiffs does not appear consonant with either doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn226\" id=\"fn226_ref\">226</a> Not only does the court thus reshape the plaintiffs' suit, but it does so after trial when there is no opportunity to fashion proof or presentation directly to the state law issues.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn227\" id=\"fn227_ref\">227</a>  Moreover, because the applicability of general Texas statutes to state agencies is unclear,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn228\" id=\"fn228_ref\">228</a> the district court should have been reluctant to consider claims grounded on those statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn229\" id=\"fn229_ref\">229</a>  \"Needless decisions of state law should be avoided both as a matter of comity and to promote justice between the parties, by procuring for them a surer-footed reading of applicable law.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn230\" id=\"fn230_ref\">230</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court should not have relied on pendent jurisdiction and should not, therefore, have decided these claims on the basis of state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the various health and safety deficiencies found by the district judge to appraise whether they, considered either alone or together with the other conditions at TDC, constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  Aside from the fire hazards discussed earlier, these deficiencies are: the sanitation problems resulting from overcrowding, which facilitate the spread of disease and tax sanitary facilities; inadequate plumbing; violations of food handling standards at some units; violations of sanitation standards in food processing areas; and inadequate safety measures in TDC's industrial operations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn231\" id=\"fn231_ref\">231</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we do not condone TDC's failure to observe the standards applicable to private industry, we do not find that any of these conditions alone, or all of them together, considered in combination with the overcrowding and security deficiencies, constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  The reduction of overcrowding will patently relieve some of these conditions.  The others can and should be attacked in a state court action in which the question of applicability of the statutes in question to TDC can be considered directly, not as a peripheral issue in this already complex case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IX. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTER</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order of reference<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn232\" id=\"fn232_ref\">232</a> appoints a special master and provides for the appointment of \"several monitors\" to help the special master.  It imposes on the special master the responsibility of seeing that the district court's decree is implemented, and empowers him to hold hearings, find facts, and make recommendations to the district court concerning TDC's compliance with the decree.  As authority for the appointment the district court invoked both Fed.R.Civ.P. 53<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn233\" id=\"fn233_ref\">233</a> and its inherent power as a court of equity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TDC contends that the appointment of a special master was improper because the district court failed to comply with rule 53, which, according to TDC, codifies and limits a court's authority to appoint a special master.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn234\" id=\"fn234_ref\">234</a>  Rule 53(b) states that a district court may appoint a special master \"only upon a showing that some exceptional condition requires\" the appointment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn235\" id=\"fn235_ref\">235</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated several reasons for its decision to make the appointment: the difficulty of superintending the implementation of \"a comprehensive, detailed plan for the elimination of the unconstitutional conditions found to exist in the Texas prison system\"; TDC's \"record of intransigence toward previous court orders requiring changes in TDC's practices and conditions\";<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn236\" id=\"fn236_ref\">236</a>  the \"strained\" working relations between TDC's lawyers and the plaintiffs' lawyers; TDC's failure to acknowledge even \"completely evident\" constitutional violations; and TDC's failure to conform its actual practices to its written policies and procedures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn237\" id=\"fn237_ref\">237</a>  The district court did not, as TDC implies, simply rely on the \"mere complexity\" of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn238\" id=\"fn238_ref\">238</a> Moreover, the court was not required to await the failure or refusal of TDC to comply with the decree before appointing an agent to implement it.  Noncompliance may constitute one \"exceptional condition\" under rule 53,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn239\" id=\"fn239_ref\">239</a> but it is not exclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, rule 53 does not terminate or modify the district court's inherent equitable power to appoint a person, whatever be his title, to assist it in administering a remedy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn240\" id=\"fn240_ref\">240</a>  The power of a federal court to appoint an agent to supervise the implementation of its decrees has long been established.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn241\" id=\"fn241_ref\">241</a>  Such court-appointed agents have been identified by \"a confusing plethora of titles: 'receiver,' 'Master,' 'Special Master,' 'master hearing officer,' 'monitor,' 'human rights committee,' 'Ombudsman,' \" and others.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn242\" id=\"fn242_ref\">242</a>  The function is clear, whatever the title.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's opinion stated the reasons for the appointment of the special master and his monitors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn243\" id=\"fn243_ref\">243</a>  As it noted, we have previously approved the appointment of such agents to oversee compliance with continuing court orders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn244\" id=\"fn244_ref\">244</a>  Insofar as the special master is to report on TDC's compliance with the district court's decree and to help implement the decree, he assumes one of the plaintiffs' traditional roles, except that, because he is the court's agent, he can and should perform his duties objectively.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn245\" id=\"fn245_ref\">245</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its order of reference, the district court describes the special master's duties as entailing \"enormous responsibilities.\"  The decree affects twenty-two TDC units, with a staff of more than 3,000 and housing more than 33,000 inmates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn246\" id=\"fn246_ref\">246</a>  The scope and complexity of the decree and the importance as well as the difficulty of ensuring compliance gave the court adequate reason to invoke its implied authority as a court of equity.  Therefore we affirm the district court's decision to appoint the special master and his monitors to observe and report on TDC's compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The special master is also given powers that are quasijudicial.  He is permitted to hold hearings and is directed to find facts \"concerning the defendants' compliance with the provisions of the Court's Orders and the need, if any, for supplemental remedial action.\"  The order also establishes rules of procedure: the monitors are to make reports of factual observations and to submit them to the special master and the parties.  If any party objects, the special master is to hold a hearing, then make his report to the district court.  No objection may be filed to the special master's report that could have been filed to the monitor's report preceding it.  The special master's findings of fact are to be accepted by the court unless clearly erroneous.  In addition, the special master may hold hearings sua sponte without a preliminary monitor's report; and in such instances factual findings in his reports are to be credited unless clearly erroneous.  He may, moreover, submit reports based on his own observations and investigations without conducting a hearing.  The order of reference does not distinguish between the credit to be given such reports and those submitted after hearings and accompanied by an evidentiary record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To fulfill his responsibilities, the special master is given sweeping powers, including \"unlimited access\" to TDC premises and records as well as the power to conduct \"confidential interviews\" with TDC staff members and inmates, and to require written reports from any TDC staff member.  These powers are unconfined save by the following instructions: he is not to intervene in the administrative management of either TDC or any of its units and he is not to direct the defendants or any of their subordinates to take or to refrain from taking any specific action to achieve compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order of reference does not make clear that, in conducting investigations and hearings, the special master and the monitors are not to consider matters that go beyond superintending compliance with the district court's decree.  Such an express constraint is appropriate because of the danger that the special master or the monitors may entertain inmate complaints that convert the remedial process into a surrogate forum for new &#167; 1983 actions.  In the interests both of prison administration and sound judicial procedure, it should be made clear to the plaintiffs, the special master, the monitors, and the TDC staff that the special master is not an inmate advocate or a roving federal district court.  As we have pointed out before,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn247\" id=\"fn247_ref\">247</a> the powers of the court's appointed agents should not intrude to an unnecessary extent on prison administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In one respect, the order of reference is too sweeping.  It permits the special master to submit to the district court \"reports based upon his own observations and investigations in the absence of a formal hearing before him.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn248\" id=\"fn248_ref\">248</a>  This not only transcends the powers traditionally given masters by courts of equity, but denies the parties due process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn249\" id=\"fn249_ref\">249</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the order of reference shall be amended as follows: (1) it should be made clear that the special master and the monitors do not have the authority to hear matters that should appropriately be the subject of separate judicial proceedings, such as actions under &#167; 1983, and that their duties are restricted to those set forth in the order of reference; and (2) unless based on hearings conducted on the record after proper notice, the reports, findings, and conclusions of the special master are not to be accorded any presumption of correctness and the \"clearly erroneous\" rule will not apply to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the reduction in the scope of the district court's decree directed by this opinion should occasion further inquiry by the district court to determine whether or not there is a continuing need for a staff of six monitors to assist the special master.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">X. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Constitution is a charter for all officials, federal and state.  All those who wield the power of the sovereign must be equally obedient to its commands and faithful in ensuring its protections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn250\" id=\"fn250_ref\">250</a>  They take the same oath we do-to uphold and to defend it.<sup>251</sup></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judicial determination has been made.  The reparative injunction will require time, skill, and intensive effort.  The district court and its special master must respect the right of the state to administer its own affairs so long as it does not violate the Constitution.  The state must equally recognize the duty of the district court and the special master as its agent to ensure the restoration of constitutional conditions of confinement in TDC.  The implementation of the district court's decree can become a ceaseless guerrilla war, with endless hearings, opinions, and appeals, and incalculable costs.  But it is instead to be hoped that, if the state adopts the policy that inmates must be accorded their constitutional rights and that prison officials will not be permitted to indulge in petty practices designed to deny those rights, the period of judicial supervision can more speedily be concluded.  To this end, it may not be inappropriate to include the exhortation that constitutional peace is the consummation devoutly to be wished as a result of Ruiz VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">XI. SUMMARY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p>11.1 Uncontested, Settled, and Moot Provisions of the District Court's Decree</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) TDC has not appealed the following provisions of the decree: Parts I(C) (quadruple-celling), I(D) (triple-celling), II(C) (use of physical force), IV(A) (disciplinary practices and procedures), IV(C)(1) (in part) (recreation opportunities for inmates on Death Row), IV(C)(2) (triple-celling in administrative segregation), IV(D) (vague rules), IX(B)-(D) (specific reporting requirements), and X (attorneys' fees and costs).

The Defendants have entered into such agreement with the express understanding that their agreement is not an admission of liability in any sense, and particularly is not an admission of bad faith.  Further, Defendants expressly make it known that in their view the agreement hereafter set out in some respects goes beyond minimal, constitutional requirements, but they have entered into said agreement in a good faith effort to terminate this litigation in the areas covered by the agreement and to preclude the need for appeal as to such areas.  Defendants, however, in executing this agreement expressly reserve the right to withdraw their consent thereto as to any part of this agreement which is not incorporated in the form hereafter set out in the final Order of the Court to be entered for the purpose of effectuating said agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The major areas covered by this Decree are in full and complete compromise and settlement of any and all claims regarding such areas and, if Defendants fully comply with the provisions of this Decree, Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervenor agree that neither will request any further relief from the Court on any of these areas except (1) as to the status of the Huntsville Hospital facility and conditions of administrative segregation confinement (extent of recreation; number of prisoners in administrative segregation cells and prohibition of routine use of administrative segregation pending disciplinary hearings) and (2) past, present and future individual claims of class members.  Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervenor agree that enforcement of this Decree will be limited to appropriate motions to effectuate the provisions of this Decree.  No additional requirements beyond those expressly stated in the Decree will be requested of the Court except to the extent necessary to enforce the provisions of this Decree.  Construction of the Decree will be governed by the ordinary and reasonable interpretation of the language therein so as to preclude any strained interpretation, the effect of which is to incorporate standards or relief beyond that agreed to in the Decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, upon the Stipulation of the parties, dated as of February 10, 1981, Defendants, their successors, agents and employees (referred to collectively as \"Defendants\") are hereby ENJOINED as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

He continues to serve that court as special monitor at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p237\">\n      <span class=\"num\">237</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Nathan is the author of The Use of Masters in Institutional Reform Litigation, 10 Tol.L.Rev. 419 (1979), which was republished and distributed by the Federal Judicial Center.  He has served and continues to serve as a consultant for the National Institute of Corrections and is an acknowledged expert in the field of implementation of judicial decrees in a correctional setting.  In view of his extensive experience and impressive credentials, Mr. Nathan is fully qualified to assume the enormous responsibilities of monitoring compliance with the Court's order in this cause.  Because the scope of application of the Court's remedial orders in this case will be infinitely broader than that encountered in any other example of correctional litigation, it is essential that the Special Master be a person with extensive experience and an established record of success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p238\">\n      <span class=\"num\">238</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Court will appoint several monitors to assist the Special Master.

First, it relies upon its inherent power to make such an appointment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p240\">\n      <span class=\"num\">240</span>\n      <p>Courts have (at least in the absence of legislation to the contrary) inherent power to provide themselves with appropriate instruments required for the performance of their duties...  This power includes authority to appoint persons unconnected with the court to aid judges in the performance of specific judicial duties, as they may arise in the progress of a cause.  From the commencement of our Government, it has been exercised by the federal courts, when sitting in equity, by appointing, either with or without the consent of the parties, special masters, auditors, examiners and commissioners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p241\">\n      <span class=\"num\">241</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ex parte Peterson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99615\"><a href=\"/opinion/99615/ex-parte-peterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span> (<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99615\"><a href=\"/opinion/99615/ex-parte-peterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></a></span>) (1920).  The enforcement of its remedial order is a judicial duty which rests with this Court, and it has the inherent power to appoint a Special Master to provide assistance toward this end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p242\">\n      <span class=\"num\">242</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Court relies upon Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in making this reference.  In its Memorandum Opinion of December 10, 1980, referred to above, the Court has demonstrated that the appointment of a Master is both necessary and appropriate in accordance with the provisions of Rule 53.  The formal fact finding role contemplated by the Rule will be particularly relevant to the Special Master in this case to the extent that he may hold hearings and make factual findings as a result of those hearings for review by the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p243\">\n      <span class=\"num\">243</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to these bases of authority, the Special Master shall assist the Court by monitoring compliance with the Court's orders in this cause.  All actions of the Special Master and any monitors or members of the Special Master's staff will be under the direct control and supervision of the Court.  In particular, the Special Master and other persons operating on the Court's behalf shall not intervene in the administrative management of the Texas Department of Corrections or any of its institutions.  In addition, the Special Master, his staff and any monitors who are appointed shall not be empowered to direct the defendants or any of their subordinates to take or to refrain from taking any specific action to achieve compliance.  The sole power to direct compliance and to punish noncompliance remains with this Court.  The duties of the Special Master, then, will be to observe, monitor, find facts, report or testify as to his findings, and make recommendations to the Court concerning steps which should be taken to achieve compliance.  The Special Master may and should assist the defendants in every possible way, and to this end he may and should confer informally with the defendants and their subordinates on matters affecting compliance.  In order to accomplish these objectives, the Special Master shall have the following powers:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p244\">\n      <span class=\"num\">244</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  The Special Master shall have unlimited access to any facilities, buildings, or premises under the jurisdiction or control of the Texas Department of Corrections, and no advance notice of any visit or inspection shall be required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p245\">\n      <span class=\"num\">245</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Special Master shall have unlimited access to the records, files and papers maintained by the Texas Department of Corrections to the extent that such access is related to the performance of the Special Master's duties of monitoring compliance.  Such access shall include all Departmental, institutional, and inmate records, including but not limited to medical records.  The Special Master may obtain copies of all such relevant records, files and papers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p246\">\n      <span class=\"num\">246</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The Special Master may conduct confidential interviews with all staff members and employees of the Texas Department of Corrections.  In addition, he may engage in informal conferences with such staff members and employees, and such persons shall cooperate with the Special Master and respond to all inquiries and requests related to compliance with the Court's orders in this case.  The Special Master may require compilation and communication of oral or written information relevant to such compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p247\">\n      <span class=\"num\">247</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The Special Master may conduct confidential interviews and meetings at the institution to which they are confined with any prisoner or group of prisoners under the jurisdiction of the Texas Department of Corrections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p248\">\n      <span class=\"num\">248</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The Special Master may attend any formal institutional meetings or proceedings at any institution under the jurisdiction of the Texas Department of Corrections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p249\">\n      <span class=\"num\">249</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. The Special Master may require written reports from any staff member or employee of the Texas Department of Corrections with respect to compliance with this Court's orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p250\">\n      <span class=\"num\">250</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. The Special Master shall have the full power to order and conduct hearings with respect to the defendants' compliance with this Court's orders.  To this end he shall have the power to require the attendance of witnesses, including both prisoners and employees of the Texas Department of Corrections, and he shall exercise all other powers described in subsection (c) of Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p251\">\n      <span class=\"num\">251</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8. The Special Master may select and employ necessary administrative, clerical, and support staff.  All such persons as well as the nature of their compensation shall be approved by the Court in advance of their employment.  In addition, with advance permission of the Court, the Special Master may hire independent specialists and experts to assist him in fulfilling the responsibilities assigned to him by this Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p252\">\n      <span class=\"num\">252</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. In exercising the powers enumerated in paragraphs 1 through 6 above, the Special Master may act by himself, or through monitors appointed by the Court.  All actions of such monitors, however, shall be supervised and coordinated by the Special Master in order to accomplish the objectives of this Reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p253\">\n      <span class=\"num\">253</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Special Master shall, as he deems necessary or as required by the Court, file reports with the Court in which he shall make findings concerning the defendants' compliance with the provisions of the Court's Orders and the need, if any, for supplemental remedial action.  In general, the Special Master's reports to the Court will be based upon reports prepared by individual monitors appointed by the Court as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p254\">\n      <span class=\"num\">254</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Reports of their factual observations shall be prepared by the monitors appointed by the Court and shall be submitted to the parties and to the Special Master.  Any objections to such a report shall be the subject of a hearing before the Special Master upon request of any party.  After the parties have had an opportunity to respond or object to a monitor's report, with or without a hearing, the Special Master shall file his report with the Court, including his findings of fact based upon the monitor's report, the record of any hearing, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p255\">\n      <span class=\"num\">255</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. No objection may be filed to the Special Master's report which could have been filed to the monitor's report preceding it.  Otherwise, any party may file written objections to the Special Master's report within fifteen days of the filing thereof with the Court.  The objecting party shall note each particular finding or recommendation to which objection is made, shall provide proposed alternative findings, and may request a hearing or oral argument before the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p256\">\n      <span class=\"num\">256</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Any request for a hearing before the Court must include a list of witnesses and documents to be presented to the Court.  A copy of the objections, proposed findings, and any request for a rehearing shall be served on all parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p257\">\n      <span class=\"num\">257</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The Special Master's findings of fact shall be accepted by the Court unless shown to be clearly erroneous.  Any evidence not previously presented to the Special Master in the course of the formal hearing preceding his report will be admitted at a hearing before the Court only upon a showing that the party offering it lacked a reasonable opportunity to present the evidence to the Special Master.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p258\">\n      <span class=\"num\">258</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Special Master may submit reports based upon hearings held by him in the absence of preliminary reports by monitors, and in such instances the Special Master's reports and findings shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The Special Master may also submit reports based upon his own observations and investigations in the absence of a formal hearing before him.  In any event, however, the Special Master's findings must be based upon evidence which is made part of the record before the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p259\">\n      <span class=\"num\">259</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Special Master shall be compensated at the rate of Ninety-Five Dollars ($95.00) per hour for services performed in accordance with this Order.  Appropriate compensation for members of the Special Master's staff as well as that of monitors shall be established by the Court upon the recommendation of the Special Master and after notice to all parties.  All reasonable expenses incurred by the Special Master in the course of the performance of his duties, including but not limited to the rental of office space and equipment in Texas, salaries of staff, long distance telephone, photocopying, printing, travel, data processing, and postage, shall be reimbursed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p260\">\n      <span class=\"num\">260</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cost of the mastership shall be borne by the defendants as costs in this action.

Plainly, any alteration of a court's remedial order, suggested by the parties, is subject to approval by the court.  Moreover, since this action is a class action, the notice provisions of Rule 23(e), F.R.Civ.P., requires that all class members be notified of the proposed settlement, and that they be given an opportunity to object to its terms.  At the close of the hearing on April 14, 1982, the proposed settlement was accepted for review by the court; additionally, the parties were directed to submit to the court a jointly prepared form of notice to the class, and a proposal as to how such notice should be published.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p267\">\n      <span class=\"num\">267</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an order entered April 21, 1982, preliminary approval was given to the settlement.  The terms of the modification are fair and reasonable, and protect, in all respects, the rights of the plaintiff class.  As indicated in the order of April 21, a just settlement of the issues involved in the stipulated modification is in the best interests of all parties to this action, not only with respect to these particular issues, but more generally regarding the entire remedial phase of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p268\">\n      <span class=\"num\">268</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order of April 21 also approved a form of notice to the class, as well as a proposed method of publication.  Under the terms of this notice, the members were thoroughly apprised of the content of the settlement, and were given an opportunity to challenge its terms, by means of written objections.  Class members were directed to file their objections with the clerk of the court, and provide copies to counsel for all parties, and to the Special Master.  A hearing was held on June 1, 1982, in Houston, Texas, for the purpose of considering any objections to the proposed settlement filed by members of the plaintiff class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p269\">\n      <span class=\"num\">269</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Numerous inmates filed objections to the stipulated modification of Sections II(A) and II(D) of the Amended Decree.  The objections raise serious concerns which merit close attention.  With one notable exception, the central thread of the objections is skepticism about defendants' willingness to comply with the terms of the settlement.  In view of the history of this litigation, this skepticism is fully understandable.  However, as with all portions of the injunctive order in this action, defendants' compliance with the terms of the stipulation will be closely monitored.  The Stipulated Modification contains elaborate provisions for ensuring enforcement of its terms.  The court is satisfied that this procedure adequately protects the rights of the plaintiff class.  Should evidence of noncompliance with the terms of the stipulation be called to the attention of the court, appropriate remedial action will be taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p270\">\n      <span class=\"num\">270</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One objection filed by a member of the plaintiff class deserves special comment.  Originally, notice of the proposed settlement was provided to plaintiff class only in English.  Consequently, Spanish-speaking inmates were severely limited in their ability to review and comment on the terms of the settlement.  To cure this shortcoming, the parties were directed to arrange for publication of notice in Spanish.  Such arrangements were made forthwith, and the court is satisfied that all inmates of the Texas Department of Corrections have been adequately notified of the settlement.  Giving consideration to the highly acute and sophisticated objections previously made by many of the members of the plaintiff class, it appears extremely unlikely that any meritorious objections not previously raised will be advanced.  Thus, on the basis of the arguments and evidence adduced at the hearing, it appears that the stipulated modification of Section II(A) and II(D) of the Amended Decree should be finally approved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p271\">\n      <span class=\"num\">271</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This action has been remanded temporarily to the district court from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to permit a hearing as to the approval and entry of the stipulated modification of the Amended Decree vel non.  It appears from the order of remand that entry of final approval will automatically re-vest jurisdiction over the appeal in the Court of Appeals.  Nevertheless, the parties are directed to notify the Clerk of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the present order has been entered and to furnish him with a complete record in this matter, including all pleadings and orders relating thereto.  The parties are further directed to take any action necessary to insure this action is reinstated in that court.  Finally, defendants are directed, in accordance with Section XIV.A of the Stipulated Modification, to file in the Court of Appeals a motion for voluntary dismissal of the portion of their appeal relating to Sections II(A) and II(D) of the Amended Decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p272\">\n      <span class=\"num\">272</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p273\">\n      <span class=\"num\">273</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SIGNED and ENTERED this 1st day of June, 1982.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p274\">\n      <span class=\"num\">274</span>\n      <p>(s) Wm.

TDC contends that the burdens imposed on it were \"far more onerous than the mere guidelines imposed on the United States.\"  In support of this contention, it does not compare what the district judge exacted of each of these parties, but rather contrasts TDC's \"Trial Outline and Supplemental summaries of defense witness testimony\" with a compendium of trial outlines furnished by the United States.  However, the United States also furnished additional material, permitting TDC to photocopy the United States' witness files, some 30,000 pages</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn33\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33_ref\">33</a>\n        <p> To support its contention, TDC points to one instance in which, over the United States' claim of \"surprise,\" the district judge admitted TDC's evidence and said he would give it minimal weight, and also to four times when he excluded TDC's proffered evidence on the ground of surprise.  TDC points with suspicion to the district judge's praise of the United States for opening its files to TDC, and to five instances in which the district judge was presumably partial to the United States because he permitted the United States' witness to testify after only fragmentary pretrial disclosure of his expected testimony</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn34\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34_ref\">34</a>\n        <p> In the appendix to the briefs, TDC has mustered every episode of what it considers to be the district judge's hostility toward TDC's witnesses and his alleged contemporaneous and unfair solicitude for the plaintiffs' witnesses.  It points out that he admonished three-quarters of TDC's witnesses not to disclose their testimony to other witnesses, but similarly admonished less than one-third of the plaintiffs' witnesses.  He thrice warned TDC's witnesses of the consequences of perjury or contempt of court.  He once prohibited TDC's counsel from reminding adverse witnesses that they were under oath.  And the district judge once, before a weekend recess, told an inmate witness to be careful to get his facts straight when the witness returned to the stand because TDC's counsel would try to impeach his testimony on cross-examination</p>\n        <p>Some imbalance in the number of witnesses admonished against discussion of their testimony resulted because the district judge gave warnings routinely only after the plaintiffs' sixty-seventh witness, George Wilson, testified that he had violated the rule, invoked at the start of the trial, against witnesses discussing their testimony with other witnesses.  The district judge promptly struck Wilson's testimony and thereafter began regularly to caution witnesses.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn35\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35_ref\">35</a>\n        <p> On a number of occasions the district judge informed TDC's counsel that he considered the TDC's cross-examination of witnesses called by plaintiffs or the United States excessively detailed and lengthy.  TDC's brief notes that several times the district judge terminated cross-examination when it lasted longer than he considered appropriate.  We note, however, that in each case he did this only after first warning counsel, in some instances repeatedly, that the duration of cross-examination was far exceeding the amount of time taken on direct examination.  The cross-examination was protracted.  Much time was spent on minor detail.

Ray, --- F.2d ---- (9th Cir. 1982), read Rhodes as rejecting \"the totality\" test.  The Hoptowit court said:</p>\n        <p>In assessing claims of Eighth Amendment violations, and equally importantly, in tailoring a proper remedy, we must analyze each claimed violation in light of these requirements (i.e., \"discrete areas of basic human needs\").  Courts may not find Eighth Amendment violations based on the \"totality of conditions\" at a prison.</p>\n        <p>Id. at ----.</p>\n        <p>However, the court later observed:</p>\n        <p>As we have said, however, \"(E)ach condition of confinement does not exist in isolation; the court must consider the effect of each condition in the context of the prison environment, especially when the ill-effects of particular conditions are exacerbated by other related conditions.\"  (Wright v. Rushen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387937\"><a href=\"/opinion/387937/james-c-wright-v-ruth-rushen/\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></a></span>, 1133 (9th Cir. 1981) ).  This is no more than a recognition that a particular violation may be the result of several contributing factors.  \"But the court's principal focus must be on specific conditions of confinement.  It may not use the totality of all conditions to justify federal intervention requiring remedies more extensive than are required to correct Eighth Amendment violations.\"  (Wright v. Rushen, 642 F.2d at 1133.)  To find an Eighth Amendment violation, courts must identify specific conditions that fail to meet Eighth Amendment requirements.  We cannot rely on a vague conclusion that the \"totality of conditions\" violates the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n        <p>Id. at ----; see id. at ----.</p>\n        <p>Hoptowit thus seems to us to say that conditions of confinement that in some circumstances would not be cruel and unusual may in other circumstances, when combined with other conditions, rise to that level.  We agree with the Hoptowit court's conclusion that a generalized and \"vague conclusion\" concerning the totality of conditions is insufficient.</p>\n        <p>TDC also argues that, \"(i)n light of Rhodes, the Ninth Circuit reiterated its condemnation of the 'totality of conditions' approach in Wright v.

The master shall prepare a report upon the matters submitted to him by the order of reference and, if required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, he shall set them forth in the report.  He shall file the report with the clerk of the court and in an action to be tried without a jury, unless otherwise directed by the order of reference, shall file with it a transcript of the proceedings and of the evidence and the original exhibits.  The clerk shall forthwith mail to all parties notice of the filing.</p>\n        <p>(2) In Non-Jury Actions.  In an action to be tried without a jury the court shall accept the master's findings of fact unless clearly erroneous.  Within 10 days after being served with notice of the filing of the report any party may serve written objections thereto upon the other parties.  Application to the court for action upon the report and upon objections thereto shall be by motion and upon notice as prescribed in Rule 6(d).  The court after hearing may adopt the report or may modify it or may reject it in whole or in part or may receive further evidence or may recommit it with instructions.</p>\n        <p>(3) In Jury Actions.  In an action to be tried by a jury the master shall not be directed to report the evidence.  His findings upon the issues submitted to him are admissible as evidence of the matters found and may be read to the jury, subject to the ruling of the court upon any objections in point of law which may be made to the report.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn234\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn234_ref\">234</a>\n        <p> We reject TDC's suggestion that rule 53 does not permit the post-decretal appointment of a special master.
