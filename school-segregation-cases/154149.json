Its\n\nBoard has seven members, elected at large.         They serve six-year\n\nstaggered terms and are elected to numbered posts.1         To be elected,\n\na candidate must win a majority of the votes cast.\n\n     Hispanics    comprise    approximately      63%   of     the     36,000\n\n(approximate) population of the three counties from which the\n\nDistrict is drawn, and about 57% of the voting age population.2\n\nAnd, according to the Texas Secretary of State's July 1990 Voter\n\nRegistration Statistical Report, 53% of the registered voters in\n\nthe three counties in which the District is located have Spanish\n\nsurnames.    Although there is some doubt about the accuracy of the\n\nHispanic population and voting age population statistics, the\n\n\n\n1\n     The District instituted a place system in 1970. \"A numbered-\npost system requires a candidate to declare for a particular seat\non a governmental body. The candidate then runs only against other\ncandidates who have declared for that position. The voters then\nhave one vote for that seat.     The system prevents the use of\nbullet, or single shot, voting.\" Campos v. City of Baytown, 840\nF.2d 1240, 1242 n.1 (5th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 905\n(1989).\n2\n     This case was tried in 1990, and the total Hispanic population\nand voting age population figures are based on the 1980 census.\nThe district court found, however, that the District's total\npopulation has remained relatively stable since 1980.\n\n                                 - 2 -\n\fparties do not dispute that Hispanics constitute a slight majority\n\nof the registered voters in the District.3\n\n     Pursuant to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1973 et seq., Hispanic voters filed suit in March 1988\n\nagainst the District and its trustees.         A two-day trial was held in\n\nNovember 1990; and in late February 1991, the district court\n\nentered    detailed,    exacting,    and     comprehensive        findings   and\n\nconclusions.    It found that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated\n\nlegally significant white bloc voting and entered judgment for the\n\ndefendants.\n\n     The district court made the following findings of fact,\n\nundisputed on appeal, concerning the District's election history\n\n(but, as    discussed   infra,   these      findings   do   not    reflect   the\n\nelection of two Hispanics over incumbents in May 1992):\n\n           In the forty-four years of the Board's existence,\n           there have been only twenty-three persons elected\n           to the Board.\n\n           The evidence shows that only two Hispanics[,\n           including Mr. Ritchie,] have ever been elected or\n           appointed to the Board of Trustees.4\n\n           For the first twenty-four years of the [District's]\n           existence, all elections for the Board were\n           uncontested.\n\n           In the past twelve years, there has been only one\n           contested election for the Board.    There was a\n\n\n\n3\n     The district judge found the evidence to that effect reliable.\n4\n     Plaintiffs dispute that Mr. Ritchie is Hispanic. He testified\nthat he considers himself to be Hispanic and has Hispanic heritage.\nRitchie was defeated by an Hispanic candidate in May 1992, as\ndiscussed infra.\n\n                                    - 3 -\n\f          contested election in 19845 and there were eleven\n          contested elections between 1970 and 1978.6 Thus,\n          in the history of the [District], there have been\n          only thirteen contested elections and in each case\n          the incumbent won.\n\n          In 1974 and 1976, an Anglo challenger ran against\n          an Anglo incumbent.     In both instances, the\n          incumbent won.\n\n          In ten instances, Hispanic candidates ran against\n          Anglo incumbents. In each case, the incumbent won.\n          In one election, an Hispanic challenger ran against\n          an Hispanic incumbent. The Hispanic incumbent won.7\n\n\n\n\n5\n     Josue Garza testified concerning his unsuccessful 1984\ncampaign for trustee. He opined that the large district size made\nelection difficult for candidates running at large. The District\nelicited testimony regarding his unsuccessful election history,\nincluding that the only time he had won office was in an\nuncontested election.\n6\n     Between 1970 and 1978 the Hispanic party La Raza Unida\nexercised political power in the area comprising the District. La\nraza means \"the race\" or \"the people\". The political impact of La\nRaza Unida diminished after 1978; and by the time of the Josue\nGarza campaign in 1984, association with the party was perceived as\na political liability.\n7\n     Subsequent to oral argument, the District submitted the\nresults of the May 1992 elections for two trustee positions. Those\nresults would alter several of the district court's factual\nfindings (including number of contested elections, number of\nHispanics elected, and success of Hispanic challengers against\nAnglo incumbents).      For each position, a Spanish surnamed\nchallenger defeated an incumbent. At least one of the incumbents\nwas Anglo; the other was E. W. Ritchie, whom plaintiffs claimed to\nbe Anglo, see note 4, supra. We simply note these facts; they do\nnot affect \"our review of the [district] court's conclusions\".\nMonroe v. City of Woodville, 881 F.2d 1327, 1329 n.2 (5th Cir.\n1989), modified on reh'g, 897 F.2d 763 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, __\nU.S. __, 111 S. Ct. 71 (1990). On the other hand, they do deflate\nappellants' assertions in their affirmative and reply briefs that\n\"[t]he proof of the pudding is the fact that no Mexican American\ncandidate has ever been able to defeat an Anglo opponent\", and that\n\"[t]he stark fact is that no Mexican American has ever defeated\n[an] Anglo in a contested race\".\n\n                              - 4 -\n\fThere has been only one runoff in the history of the District, in\n\nwhich the candidate, an Anglo, who won by a plurality in the first\n\nelection, carried a majority in the second.\n\n     At   trial,     plaintiffs    presented     evidence   of   a   strong\n\ncorrelation between race and voting in the District.                    It is\n\nundisputed here that cohesion exists among Hispanic voters, that\n\nelections are racially polarized, and that Anglos and Hispanics\n\nengage in bloc voting.         Although there was some testimony that\n\nAnglos and Hispanics coalesce around distinct sets of issues,\n\nthere was also testimony that the Board is not political and that\n\ncampaigns are not issue-driven.\n\n     Plaintiffs      offered   evidence    on   practical   inhibitors     to\n\nHispanic voting, including the effect of dual registration, \"soft\"\n\nvoting rolls that include residents who have moved,8 and the\n\nmigrant population within the District.             However, it was not\n\nestablished   that    these    phenomena   impact   Hispanic   voters    more\n\nfrequently than Anglos.9       Although a procedure exists for removing\n\nthe names of persons who have moved from the voting rolls, the\n\nparties dispute its effectiveness.\n\n8\n     Several witnesses offered anecdotal testimony concerning\npersons listed twice on the rolls (dual registration) or persons\nwho remain listed despite the fact that they have moved.\n9\n     The district court found: \"There were no studies or other\ncredible evidence presented that measured the comparative rate of\nthese phenomena by ethnic group. ... Although there was anecdotal\nevidence regarding persons registering and then moving, there were\nno studies to confirm or measure this phenomenon. ... Although\nthere was testimony that as many as ten percent of the voters on\nthe registration [rolls] had moved, plaintiffs' witnesses were able\nto identify only about one percent in precincts with which they\nwere familiar.\"\n\n                                   - 5 -\n\f     The plaintiffs contended in district court that the absence of\n\nmigrant   workers   within   the   District   at   election   time   is   a\n\nsignificant factor in Hispanic voters' inability to elect their\n\npreferred candidates. They introduced a report prepared in 1976 --\n\n14 years before trial -- by the Governor's Office of Migrant\n\nAffairs (GOMA), which lists, as of 1976, approximately 8,500\n\npersons as migrants within the three-county area.10       It stated that\n\nmigrants typically leave the District in March, April, and May, and\n\nreturn in September, October, and early November.\n\n     The district court questioned the GOMA report's accuracy and\n\nprobativeness, noting, for example, that it includes in its count\n\nall migrant family members, not just persons eligible to vote; the\n\nestimate of 8500 migrants includes those who did any migrant work\n\nin the five years before 1976 and who may have done such work for\n\nonly one day; and, the GOMA report was based on data compiled from\n\nthe 1970 census and predicted a stable migrant population for only\n\nfive to ten years -- that is, until 1981-86.11          Finally, as the\n\ndistrict court noted, plaintiffs presented no evidence on the\n\npercentage of migrants registered to vote.           Accordingly, it is\n\nunclear to what extent the absence of migrant workers from the\n\n10\n     The preface to the population figures contains the following\ndisclaimer: \"The following estimates should be taken for their\nface-value as projected estimates having restricted statistical\ntestworthiness.\"\n11\n     There was contradictory testimony concerning whether migrant\nwork was more prevalent in 1990, the time of trial, than in the\nmid-1970's. Trustee Flores testified that it was less prevalent;\nformer Commissioner Cardona, that it was more.          Plaintiffs\nintroduced no figures from the 1990 census concerning the level of\nmigrant population in the District.\n\n                                   - 6 -\n\fDistrict during an election means an absence of Hispanic registered\n\nvoters.   Plaintiffs' expert admitted:       \"I don't know that we have\n\nthe hard data that says what the political behavior of migrants\n\n[is] in the studies that we have before us.\"\n\n     The plaintiffs also contended in district court that, although\n\nHispanics   represent    a   majority   of   registered   voters   in   the\n\nDistrict, more Anglos than Hispanics actually vote in District\n\nBoard elections.    They introduced a study, based on, among others,\n\nthe 1984 and 1986 elections, which showed that more Anglo voters\n\nusually turned out and that their votes generally constituted the\n\nmajority of those cast. The district court had \"difficulty drawing\n\nany conclusions or inferences from\" the study, however, because of\n\nerrors it contained.12\n\n     As discussed    infra, the district court made findings on\n\nrelevant factors such as no discrimination against Hispanics by the\n\nDistrict, literacy and other education comparisons, and poverty\n\nlevel comparisons. In its conclusions of law, it applied Thornburg\n\nv. Gingles, albeit construing it too narrowly in some respects, as\n\nalso discussed infra, and held, inter alia, that, \"[w]here the\n\nprotected group constitutes a majority of the registered voters in\n\nan election district, [then: (1)] any Anglo bloc voting that might\n\nexist is not legally significant\"; and (2) \"the use of an at-large\n\n\n12\n     The defendants examined some of the elections depicted in the\nstudy. As the district court noted, for each election in which\ndefendants recalculated the data, the results had to be modified to\nincrease the percentage of votes cast by Hispanics and to decrease\nAnglo vote percentages. Also, the study erred in counting persons\nwith common Hispanic surnames as Anglo voters.\n\n                                  - 7 -\n\fsystem is not dilutive\".       In so holding, it cited Perea v. Town of\n\nPecos City, No. P-83-CA-22 (W.D. Tex. April 20, 1984) (pre-Gingles:\n\ndiscussed in note 14, infra) and \"dictum\" from City of Woodville.\n\nIt also held that \"[t]o the extent that at-large systems are\n\ndilutive, it is because they submerge minority groups in a district\n\ndominated by the majority\". In holding against the plaintiffs, the\n\ndistrict court made the following \"ultimate finding\":\n\n                Although there is evidence that Hispanics have\n           been underrepresented on the [District] Board, this\n           Court is hesitant to intervene when those same\n           Hispanics could readily solve this problem by\n           simply running candidates and turning out to vote.\n           While the Court is cognizant of the history of\n           discrimination that has occurred in the area, the\n           evidence presented at trial demonstrated that\n           Hispanics have been able to get elected to offices\n           in political units within the [District] when\n           significant Anglo support was required.     Finding\n           that plaintiffs enjoy the same \"opportunities [as]\n           other members of the electorate to participate in\n           the political process and to elect candidates of\n           their choice,\" this Court enters judgment for\n           defendants.\n\n                                    II.\n\n     The   Hispanic   voters    contend    that   their   registered   voter\n\nmajority status in the District does not immunize the District from\n\na § 2 attack by that majority; and that, in ruling on a § 2 claim\n\ninvolving such factors, the district court must still consider the\n\ntotality of circumstances, as opposed to denying relief solely\n\nbecause the plaintiffs cannot satisfy the three preconditions\n\nestablished in Gingles for § 2 cases challenging multimember\n\ndistricts.13   Maintaining that the district court did not consider\n\n13\n    As discussed infra, one of the district court's conclusions of\nlaw was that \"[t]he failure to establish any of the [three]\n\n                                   - 8 -\n\fthe totality of circumstances, the Hispanic voters contend that\n\nthis case must be remanded for that purpose.              Concomitantly, they\n\ncharge the district court with failing to consider properly the\n\nevidence they presented, including on the question of racially\n\npolarized   voting,   and    assert    that   its   findings     of   fact   were\n\ninsufficient under Fed. R. Civ. P. 52 standards set by this court,\n\nbecause they were not sufficiently specific and detailed and failed\n\nto state why some evidence was not considered.                  In short, they\n\ncontend that the district court's findings were clearly erroneous\n\n-- the standard of review for § 2 cases, as discussed in part II.B.\n\n                                       A.\n\n     We   first   consider    whether       plaintiffs,    as   members      of   a\n\nregistered voter majority class, are precluded, as a matter of law,\n\nfrom bringing a vote dilution claim.            We hold that they are not.\n\nOur decision in Monroe v. City of Woodville arguably rendered the\n\nsame holding.     In that multimember district case, this court\n\nfocused on plaintiffs constituting a majority of the district's\n\npopulation and held, in part:          \"Unimpeachable authority from our\n\ncircuit has rejected any per se rule that a racial minority that is\n\na majority in a political subdivision cannot experience vote\n\ndilution.... Such a case is not ... precluded as a matter of law.\"\n\n881 F.2d at 1333.     Here, however, Hispanics constitute not only a\n\nsizable population majority, but also a registered voter majority.\n\n\n\nThornburg preconditions is fatal to the plaintiffs' case and\nprecludes the necessity of considering the Zimmer factors or other\nproof.   Overton v City of Austin, 871 F.2d 529, 538 (5th Cir.\n1989).\"\n\n                                      - 9 -\n\fWe must decide whether they fail, as a matter of law, in claiming\n\nthat an at-large district can illegally dilute their vote in such\n\na circumstance.       This is an issue of first impression in our\n\ncircuit.14    Needless    to   say,   constituting    a   registered   voter\n\nmajority is far more significant in a voting rights case than\n\nsimply being a population majority.            This notwithstanding, as\n\ndiscussed    below,   a   protected   group   --   even   when   it   is   the\n\nregistered voter majority -- may seek relief in a vote dilution\n\ncase.   Whether it can obtain relief is, of course, a question of\n\nproof, as discussed in part II.B.2.\n\n     Because this is a case of first impression, we replow quite\n\nfamiliar voting rights ground, in order to establish a firm and\n\nsure bedding for laying the \"totality of circumstances\" path that\n\nwe must follow in order to reach our destination.           The path is not\n\nlong, but it must be straight and sure.              It travels over, and\n\ntouches, many obvious basic, and quite sensitive, bedrock national\n\nprinciples and issues.      Many of the battles that helped clear this\n\nground were fought long ago; others, in the not too distant past.\n\nThe memory of them is most painful, but we are equally mindful of\n\nour limited role as we make this journey.\n\n\n\n14\n     In Perea v. Town of Pecos City, No. P-83-CA-22 (W.D. Tex.\nApril 20, 1984), decided before Gingles, the court denied a § 2\nchallenge brought by Mexican American voters, who were a registered\nvoter majority in Reeves County, Texas. Op. at 5, 13. The court\nreached its conclusion based on a consideration of the various\nZimmer, or Senate Report, factors, now incorporated into the § 2\n\"totality of the circumstances\" analysis, as discussed infra. Id.\nat 8-12. It held that the challenge was in part an attempt to\nachieve proportional representation. Id. at 13.\n\n                                  - 10 -\n\f     In Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485 F.2d 1297 (5th Cir. 1973) (en\n\nbanc), aff'd sub nom. East Carroll Parish School Board v.

Section 2 is not\n           restricted to numerical minorities but is violated\n           whenever the voting strength of a traditionally\n           disadvantaged racial group is diluted. ... We\n           conclude, as a matter of law, that a numerical\n           analysis of the voting age population in a\n           particular geographic area does not automatically\n           preclude application of section 2 to a challenged\n           voting practice used in that area.\n\nSee also id. at 1434 (Hanson, J., concurring) (\"Congress ... has\n\nmandated that no state voting procedure can be allowed to stand\n\nwhich `results' in the dilution of the voting strength of a\n\ntraditionally    disadvantaged   racial      group   in   `any   state'   or\n\n`subdivision' thereof.\"     (Emphasis added.)).22\n\n     In Gingles, the question of whether a population majority,\n\nvoting   age   population   majority,   or   registered    voter   majority\n\ndivested a racial or language minority (\"protected class\") of its\n\nprotected status was not presented, because in that case, black\n\nvoters were \"a distinct population and registered-voter minority in\n\neach challenged district.\"     478 U.S. at 38.       The Court assumed in\n\nits discussion that the protected class, while consisting of\n\n\"members of geographically insular racial and ethnic groups\", id.\n\nat 64, was, at the same time, the numerical minority; likewise, the\n\nwhite, numerically superior group was the majority.          See id. at 48\n\n(\"the majority, by virtue of its numerical superiority\").             And,\n\n22\n     But compare Jeffers v. Clinton, 730 F. Supp. 196, 252 (E.D.\nArk. 1989) (three judge court) (Eisele, J., concurring and\ndissenting) (\"[A]s long as there are no legal barriers to\nregistration or voting, then it is my view that 50-plus percent\n[voting age population] is a `majority' and 50-minus percent\n[voting age population] is a `minority'.\"), aff'd mem., __ U.S. __,\n111 S. Ct. 662 (1991).\n\n                                 - 17 -\n\fwhile the Court discussed at several points the submergence of\n\nminority voters in a white majority, it is unclear whether it was\n\ndiscussing the paradigm of a vote dilution case or the facts of the\n\nparticular case before it.            See, e.g., id. at 46 (discussing\n\nsubmergence of black votes in a white majority); id. at 51 (to\n\nestablish white bloc voting, \"the minority group demonstrates that\n\nsubmergence in a white multimember district impedes its ability to\n\nelect its chosen representatives\"); id. at 68 (\"vote dilution\n\nthrough submergence in a white majority\").\n\n      As stated, just as this court has rejected a per se rule that\n\npopulation majority groups cannot experience vote dilution through\n\nuse of an at-large system, we hold that a protected class that is\n\nalso a registered voter majority is not foreclosed, as a matter of\n\nlaw, from raising a vote dilution claim.           First, the Voting Rights\n\nAct protects racial and language minorities; it does not focus on\n\nthe vote dilution a group experiences merely because it is the\n\nnumerical minority.          Second, the same reasons counseling that\n\npopulation majorities may experience vote dilution suggest that the\n\nsame may occur where the protected class is a voting age population\n\nmajority, or even a registered voter majority.                  Minority groups\n\n(protected classes) do not lose the protection of the Voting Rights\n\nAct   when    they    are   no   longer   population      or   registered   voter\n\nminorities in a political subdivision; the Act is directed at their\n\nstatus   as    a     national    racial   or   language    minority.        It   is\n\nconceivable that an election structure could dilute a registered\n\nvoter majority's vote or that low turnout, among a group registered\n\n\n                                     - 18 -\n\fin    high   percentages,   could   result   from    a    Voting   Rights   Act\n\nviolation.     Obviously, plaintiffs must prove it.          And, third, the\n\nSupreme Court has instructed that,\n\n             in evaluating a statutory claim of vote dilution\n             through districting, the trial court is to consider\n             the `totality of the circumstances' and to\n             determine, based `upon a searching practical\n             evaluation of the \"past and present reality,\"'\n             whether the political process is equally open to\n             minority   voters.      `\"This   determination   is\n             peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case\"'.\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (quoting S. Rep. No. 417, supra, at 30 and\n\nRogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 621 (1982)) (emphasis added).                 See\n\nalso Westwego     Citizens   for    Better   Gov't   v.    City    of   Westwego\n\n(Westwego III), 946 F.2d 1109, 1120 (5th Cir. 1991).\n\n       The Court's instruction to employ a case-by-case approach\n\ncounsels against a per se rule that a protected class, that is also\n\na    registered   voter   majority,   cannot   experience     vote      dilution\n\nthrough use of an at-large district.         As noted, this conclusion is\n\nconsistent with our court's statement in City of Woodville that\n\n             [a]s de jure restrictions on the right to vote\n             mercifully recede further into the historical past,\n             we should expect it to be increasingly difficult to\n             assemble a Zimmer-type voting rights case against\n             an at-large electoral district where a minority-\n             majority population exists. Such a case is not,\n             however, precluded as a matter of law.\n\n881 F.2d at 1333.\n\n                                      B.\n\n       To hold that plaintiffs, even though a registered voter\n\nmajority, may bring a vote dilution claim only begins our inquiry.\n\nAs stated in § 2(b), in order to establish a § 2(a) violation,\n\nplaintiffs must show \"that the political processes leading to\n\n                                    - 19 -\n\fnomination or election ... are not equally open to participation by\n\nmembers of [the protected class] in that its members have less\n\nopportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in\n\nthe   political   process   and   to   elect   representatives   of   their\n\nchoice.\"   42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).        Section 2(b) provides in full:\n\n                A violation of subsection (a) of this section\n           is established if, based on the totality of\n           circumstances, it is shown that the political\n           processes leading to nomination or election in the\n           State or political subdivision are not equally open\n           to participation by members of a class of citizens\n           protected by subsection (a) of this section in that\n           its members have less opportunity than other\n           members of the electorate to participate in the\n           political process and to elect representatives of\n           their choice.   The extent to which members of a\n           protected class have been elected to office in the\n           State or political subdivision is one circumstance\n           which may be considered: Provided, That nothing in\n           this section establishes a right to have members of\n           a protected class elected in numbers equal to their\n           proportion in the population.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(b) (underlining added).        As discussed infra, in a\n\nmultimember or at-large challenge, where the protected class is\n\nalso the registered voter majority, the \"totality of circumstances\"\n\nanalysis becomes even more significant.        That analysis consists of\n\nan application of the earlier referenced Zimmer, or Senate Report,\n\nfactors.

For example, in addition to the earlier quoted findings on\n\n\n                                  - 20 -\n\felectoral success, some of the totality of circumstances findings\n\nin this case were:\n\n          While in the past there has been segregation in the\n          public schools and discrimination in the area\n          against Hispanics, the [District] has never been\n          segregated   and   there   was   no   evidence   of\n          discrimination against Hispanics by the [District].\n\n          According to the 1980 Census of Population, 41.6%\n          of the Hispanic population of the three county area\n          over the age of twenty-five were functionally\n          illiterate or had completed less than four years of\n          formal education.     Anglos, on the other hand,\n          showed only a 4.1% functional illiteracy rate in\n          the same age group.\n\n          Only 20.5% of the Hispanics were graduates of high\n          school, as opposed to more than 64% of the Anglos.\n          Further, 81% of the residents of the [District]\n          with college degrees were Anglo.\n\n          Almost 37% of the Hispanic families in the three\n          county area were below the poverty level as\n          compared to only 11% of the Anglo families.\n          Further, just over 50% of the Hispanic families,\n          but only 16.8% of the Anglo families were below\n          125% of the poverty level.\n\n     We must now determine whether the alleged vote dilution is\n\nattributable to the challenged election practice -- use of an at-\n\nlarge district.23    The Supreme Court has instructed that:\n\n          Minority voters who contend that the multimember\n          form of districting violates § 2, must prove that\n          the use of a multimember electoral structure\n          operates to minimize or cancel out their ability to\n          elect their preferred candidates.\n\n               While many or all of the [totality of\n          circumstances] factors listed in the Senate Report\n          may be relevant to a claim of vote dilution through\n          submergence in multimember districts, unless there\n          is a conjunction of the following circumstances,\n          the use of multimember districts generally will not\n\n23\n     At-large districts are not per se unlawful.     E.g., Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 48; Zimmer, 485 F.2d at 1304.\n\n                                - 21 -\n\f           impede the ability of minority voters to elect\n           representatives    of    their   choice.      Stated\n           succinctly, a bloc voting majority must usually be\n           able   to   defeat    candidates   supported  by   a\n           politically    cohesive,    geographically   insular\n           minority group. ... These circumstances are\n           necessary preconditions for multimember districts\n           to operate to impair minority voters' ability to\n           elect representatives of their choice for the\n           following reasons. First, the minority group must\n           be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently\n           large and geographically compact to constitute a\n           majority in a single-member district. ... Second,\n           the minority group must be able to show that it is\n           politically cohesive. ... Third, the minority must\n           be able to demonstrate that the white majority\n           votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it -- in the\n           absence of special circumstances ... -- usually to\n           defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\n\nGingles,   478   U.S.    at   48-51    (citations   and    footnote   omitted;\n\nunderlining added); see also East Jefferson, 926 F.2d at 491.               As\n\ndiscussed below, a critical question in this case is whether the\n\nplaintiffs must prove all three preconditions before the district\n\ncourt   considers       whether,      in   light    of    the   \"totality   of\n\ncircumstances\", the challenged practice is dilutive.\n\n     We review under the clearly erroneous standard the district\n\ncourt's findings concerning (1) the three Gingles preconditions,\n\n(2) the factors relevant to the totality of circumstances analysis;\n\nand (3) vote dilution (the ultimate finding).              Westwego III, 946\n\nF.2d at 1118 & n.13.      It is well to revisit the holding in Gingles\n\non the standard of review, part of which was quoted earlier:\n\n                We reaffirm our view that the clearly-\n           erroneous test of Rule 52(a) is the appropriate\n           standard for appellate review of a finding of vote\n           dilution. As both amended § 2 and its legislative\n           history make clear, in evaluating a statutory claim\n           of vote dilution through districting, the trial\n           court is to consider the \"totality of the\n           circumstances\" and to determine, based \"upon a\n\n                                      - 22 -\n\f          searching practical evaluation of the `past and\n          present reality,'\" whether the political process is\n          equally   open   to  minority    voters.     \"`This\n          determination is peculiarly dependent upon the\n          facts of each case,'\" and requires \"an intensely\n          local appraisal of the design and impact\" of the\n          contested electoral mechanisms.      The fact that\n          amended § 2 and its legislative history provide\n          legal standards which a court must apply to the\n          facts in order to determine whether § 2 has been\n          violated does not alter the standard of review. As\n          we explained in Bose [Corp. v. Consumers Union of\n          U.S., Inc., 446 U.S. 485 (1984)], Rule 52(a) \"does\n          not inhibit an appellate court's power to correct\n          errors of law, including those that may infect a\n          so-called mixed finding of law and fact, or a\n          finding   of   fact  that   is   predicated  on   a\n          misunderstanding of the governing rule of law.\"\n          Thus, the application of the clearly-erroneous\n          standard to ultimate findings of vote dilution\n          preserves the benefit of the trial court's\n          particular   familiarity    with   the   indigenous\n          political reality without endangering the rule of\n          law.\n\n478 U.S. at 79 (citations omitted; emphasis added).     And, as is\n\nmore than well established, a finding of fact is clearly erroneous\n\n\"only when although there may be evidence to support it, the\n\nreviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite\n\nand firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"   Westwego\n\nIII, 946 F.2d at 1118.\n\n                                 1.\n\n     The district court found for plaintiffs on the first two\n\nGingles preconditions, Hispanics could constitute a majority in a\n\nsingle member district and are politically cohesive; and the\n\nDistrict does not contest those findings.      Therefore, the only\n\nprecondition in issue is the third -- whether white bloc voting\n\nexists that usually operates to defeat the protected class's\n\npreferred candidate.   In considering this precondition, especially\n\n                               - 23 -\n\fwhere the minority is also a majority under one or more criteria,\n\nit is well to remember that \"[t]he determinative question for a\n\nSection 2 claim ... is not whether whites generally vote as a bloc,\n\nbut rather, whether such bloc voting is legally significant.\" City\n\nof Woodville, 881 F.2d at 1332 (emphasis added).\n\n     As quoted in full in note 13 supra, the district court\n\nconcluded   that   unless   all   three    Gingles   preconditions   were\n\nestablished, it was not necessary to consider \"the Zimmer factors\n\nor other proof\", citing Overton v. City of Austin, 871 F.2d 529,\n\n538 (5th Cir. 1989).   In Overton, however, as in other decisions by\n\nthis court stating that same rule, the protected class was not a\n\npopulation, or other, majority.      See, e.g., Westwego III, 946 F.2d\n\nat 1116, 1120; East Jefferson, 926 F.2d at 491.       On the other hand,\n\nin City of Woodville, this court noted that this third Gingles\n\nprecondition may not be the appropriate test for analyzing vote\n\ndilution claims in a jurisdiction with a protected class that is a\n\npopulation majority.    This is because in Gingles, as noted, the\n\nCourt was dealing with a case where black voters were a distinct\n\npopulation minority and where the evil they complained of was\n\nsubmergence in a white multimember district.          Gingles discussed\n\nthe third precondition against this factual backdrop:\n\n            In establishing this last circumstance [legally\n            significant white bloc voting], the minority group\n            demonstrates   that   submergence   in   a   white\n            multimember district impedes its ability to elect\n            its chosen representatives.\n\n478 U.S. at 51; see also City of Woodville, 881 F.2d at 1333.\n\nWhether this third precondition \"was intended to address\" a vote\n\n\n                                  - 24 -\n\fdilution claim where the protected class is the majority, is, this\n\ncourt noted, \"a matter of speculation among several possible\n\ninterpretations.\"     Id.24    This court did not linger long over this\n\nquestion,    noting    immediately       the   overriding     totality   of\n\ncircumstances question:\n\n            The issue is, however, ultimately irrelevant\n            because irrespective of [Gingles'] meaning in a\n            case like this, Zimmer's holding clearly was not\n            abandoned when Congress amended Section 2.\n\n                 Because we have already concluded that a\n            [Gingles] vote dilution claim is foreclosed here by\n            lack of black political cohesion, and we conclude\n            in the following discussion that a Zimmer totality\n            of circumstances dilution claim was not proven by\n            appellants, we need not opine further on this\n            puzzling aspect of [Gingles].\n\nId. at 1333-34 (emphasis added).         The City of Woodville court had\n\nstated earlier that \"[t]he [Gingles] threshold analysis does not\n\nreplace   the   totality      of   circumstances   inquiry,   the   ultimate\n\ndetermination to be made under Section 2.\"               Id. at 1330 n.4\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     In any event, for a case of the type presented here, Gingles\n\noffers guidance on how the third precondition is to be applied.\n\nThe Court noted that \"[t]he amount of white bloc voting that can\n\ngenerally `minimize or cancel' [minority] voters' ability to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice ... will vary from district to\n\ndistrict according to a number of factors\".         478 U.S. at 56.    Among\n\n\n24\n     Another circuit has used the third Gingles prong to analyze\nwhether plaintiffs could make out a vote dilution claim where\nwhites were a registered voter minority. See Meek v. Metropolitan\nDade County, 908 F.2d 1540, 1547 (11th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, __\nU.S. __, 111 S. Ct. 1108 (1991).\n\n                                     - 25 -\n\fthese factors is \"the percentage of registered voters in the\n\ndistrict who are members of the minority group\".    Id.   The Court\n\nconcluded that whether the evidence of racial bloc voting \"rises to\n\nthe level of legal significance under § 2\" will depend on the\n\nfactual circumstances of each case and that, accordingly, \"there is\n\nno simple doctrinal test for the existence of legally significant\n\nracial bloc voting.\"   Id. at 57-58.\n\n     We, as did the City of Woodville panel, find the third\n\nprecondition difficult to apply in a case such as this.   But, like\n\nthat panel, we stay fixed on, and follow, the controlling totality\n\nof circumstances path and do not tarry long, or wander off, in\n\npursuit of trying to fashion some alternative third (white bloc\n\nvoting) precondition for instances where the protected class is, in\n\nfact, the majority.25 It is useful, however, to recall that a court\n\nanalyzes the legal significance of racial bloc voting in order to\n\n25\n     For example, the Supreme Court established the three\npreconditions for mounting a multimember challenge because, if the\nplaintiffs lacked the potential to elect representatives in a\nsmaller, single member district, then such alternative, single\nmember districts, would not constitute relief, nor would the at-\nlarge district be cause of § 2 injury. See, e.g., Gingles, 478\nU.S. at 48-51, 48 n.15, 50 n.16. The District contends that the\nat-large structure is to the Hispanic voters' advantage, asserting\nthat, because they are a voter majority, they can elect candidates\nof their choice to each and every position on the District's Board.\nBut, because the Hispanic voters are such a majority, and because\nof their arguable, if not proven, lack of electoral success, then\nanother factor is arguably inhibiting, if not preventing, such\nsuccess. Under various complex theories, it can be contended that\nall three Gingles preconditions are applicable when the protected\nclass is a population, or other, majority; under other equally\ncomplex theories, that the third precondition, concerning usual\neffectiveness of white bloc voting, is not applicable. But, the\nplain command of § 2, to follow the totality of circumstances,\nbrings this complex and intriguing puzzle to a merciful end; and we\nresume our journey on its path.\n\n                              - 26 -\n\fanswer a   more   ultimate    question,    namely,   \"the    impact   of   the\n\ncontested structure or practice on minority electoral opportunities\n\n`on the basis of objective factors.'\"          Gingles, 478 U.S. at 44.\n\nConcomitantly, it is the plaintiffs' burden, in order to justify\n\nrelief, to \"prove that the use of a multimember electoral structure\n\noperates to minimize or cancel out their ability to elect their\n\npreferred candidates.\"       Id. at 48.\n\n     Underlying these functions of the court and the plaintiffs in\n\na multimember district vote dilution case is an inquiry into\n\ncausation -- whether the given electoral practice is responsible\n\nfor plaintiffs' inability to elect their preferred representatives.\n\nLikewise, the Supreme Court, in measuring legally significant white\n\nbloc voting, aims at determining whether it is racial voting\n\npatterns, along with other objective factors, rather than some\n\nother set of causes, that explain the lack of electoral success of\n\nvoters within the protected class.           Accordingly, in analyzing\n\nlegally significant white bloc voting in a case where the protected\n\nclass is also a population, registered voter, or other majority,\n\nthe third Gingles precondition requires an inquiry into the causal\n\nrelationship between the challenged practice and the lack of\n\nelectoral success by the protected class voters.            First, is voting\n\npolarized along racial lines?        Second, given that the protected\n\nclass voters are the registered voter majority in the district, is\n\ntheir inability to elect their preferred representatives caused\n\nprimarily by racial bloc voting or, instead, by other circumstances\n\nwhich the Act does not redress?\n\n\n                                  - 27 -\n\f      Concerning racial polarization in voting, the district court\n\nfound:\n\n             The analysis of the electoral evidence plaintiffs\n             presented indicates a very high degree of support\n             by Hispanics for Hispanic candidates. That is to\n             say that a Hispanic candidate running against an\n             Anglo opponent always receives the majority of the\n             Hispanic vote.\n\nIt did not make a finding concerning Anglo bloc voting, but the\n\nDistrict concedes it in its brief here.              As noted, the district\n\ncourt cited Town of Pecos City (pre-Gingles; used totality of\n\ncircumstances analysis) and \"dictum\" from City of Woodville to\n\nconclude that \"[w]here the protected group constitutes a majority\n\nof the registered voters in an election district, any Anglo bloc\n\nvoting that might exist is not legally significant.\"                 (Emphasis\n\nadded.)      But, as also noted, its subsequent, ultimate finding was\n\nthat the true cause for lack of Hispanic electoral success was not\n\nunequal electoral opportunity, but rather the failure of Hispanic\n\nvoters to take advantage of that opportunity:                \"[T]his Court is\n\nhesitant to intervene when those same Hispanics could readily solve\n\nthis problem by simply running candidates and turning out to vote.\"\n\n      Accordingly, notwithstanding the district court's absolute\n\nunderlying holding, its opinion should not be read to hold that, as\n\na   matter    of    law,    Anglo   bloc   voting   cannot   ever   be    legally\n\nsignificant        whenever   the   protected   class   also   constitutes     a\n\nregistered voter majority.          As discussed, neither of the cases it\n\ncited, City of Woodville and Town of Pecos City, so held.                 And, as\n\nthe   Supreme       Court     has   instructed,     determining     the    legal\n\nsignificance of white bloc voting is a factual inquiry that will\n\n                                      - 28 -\n\fvary with the circumstances of each case.       Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57-\n\n58.\n\n      Although a registered voter majority class faces an obvious,\n\ndifficult burden in proving that their inability to elect results\n\nfrom white bloc voting, they are not precluded, as a matter of law,\n\nfrom seeking to prove such a claim.      In deciding such a majority's\n\nclaim, the district court looks to the totality of circumstances.\n\nIn doing so, it need not base its finding on any particular Zimmer\n\nfactor or configuration of factors.        \"No one of the factors is\n\ndispositive; the plaintiffs need not prove a majority of them;\n\nother factors may be relevant.\"     Westwego III, 946 F.2d at 1120.\n\nSee id. n.16 (listing the factors); Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45.\n\nNotwithstanding some of its conclusions of law, as discussed above,\n\nwe disagree with the Hispanic voters' contention that the district\n\ncourt failed   to   properly   consider,   or   make   findings   on,   the\n\ntotality of circumstances factors in this case, as discussed below.\n\nIn the alternative, and assuming arguendo that the district court\n\ndid not proceed beyond a conclusion that failure to satisfy the\n\nthird Gingles precondition ended the dispute, we hold that the\n\nfindings of fact by the district court satisfy the totality of\n\ncircumstances test and are, therefore, sufficient to uphold its\n\njudgment, as also demonstrated below.\n\n                                  2.\n\n      In attempting to meet this burden of proof under the totality\n\nof circumstances, the protected class -- that is also some form of\n\nmajority -- may attempt to prove, for example, that its registered\n\n\n                                - 29 -\n\fvoter majority is illusory, as plaintiffs attempted here.                             They\n\nintroduced evidence of \"soft\" voting rolls that included residents\n\nwho    had   moved   away       and    double    listings    for    the    same    voter.\n\nHowever, as the district court found, plaintiffs failed to provide\n\ncredible studies.          Their evidence consisted mainly of anecdotal\n\ntestimony in which witnesses only identified a small number of\n\ninaccuracies in voter lists per precinct.                      The plaintiffs also\n\nfailed to prove that \"soft\" voting rolls implicated Hispanics more\n\nheavily than Anglos.         The district court's findings concerning the\n\nvoting rolls were not clearly erroneous.\n\n       As another example, plaintiffs might be able to prove that a\n\nregistered     voter      majority      was     illusory,    because      of   practical\n\nimpediments to voting.           In this case, they attempted to prove that\n\na significant portion of the Hispanic population was unavailable to\n\nvote    on   the   date    of    the    election,      because     of   migrant       work.\n\nHowever, the district court did not credit that evidence, because\n\nnone was presented that reliably proved (1) the extent of the\n\nmigrant      population     at    the    time     of   the   trial;26     or    (2)    what\n\npercentage of migrant workers are registered voters.                           Plaintiffs\n\nalso failed to prove the inadequacy of absentee voting procedures\n\nto allow migrant workers absent from the District to vote.                             The\n\ndistrict     court's      findings      that     the   Hispanic    registered         voter\n\nmajority was not illusory are not clearly erroneous.\n\n\n\n26\n     As noted, the plaintiffs relied on the 1976 GOMA study that\nprojected stable migrant populations only until 1981-86, whereas\nthe trial was conducted in 1990.\n\n                                          - 30 -\n\f       As another example, plaintiffs could conceivably prove that,\n\ndespite a registered voter majority, low turnout at elections was\n\nthe result of prior official discrimination.                        E.g., Graves v.\n\nBarnes,     343   F.    Supp.   at     733    (\"the     reason      that    the   voter\n\nparticipation among the Mexican-Americans is so low is that their\n\nvoting patterns were established under precisely the same sort of\n\ndiscriminatory State actions that we have already found both\n\nrelevant    and   condemnatory        with    regard    to    the    Dallas    Blacks\"\n\n(emphasis in original)).        Plaintiffs would face a difficult burden\n\nof proof; but, as this court noted in Westwego Citizens for Better\n\nGov't v. City of Westwego (Westwego I), 872 F.2d 1201, 1212 (5th\n\nCir.    1989),    \"Congress     and     the    courts     have      recognized    that\n\n`political participation by minorities tends to be depressed where\n\nminority group members suffer effects of prior discrimination'\".\n\n(Quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 69).               Here, plaintiffs introduced\n\nevidence of disputed accuracy that, at some Board elections,\n\nHispanic turnout was roughly seven percentage points below that of\n\nAnglos.27    However, they offered no evidence directly linking this\n\nlow turnout with past official discrimination.                          Obviously, a\n\nprotected class is not entitled to § 2 relief merely because it\n\nturns out in a lower percentage than whites to vote.                       Further, the\n\nhigh   incidence       of   Hispanic    registration         in   the      District   is\n\npersuasive evidence that Hispanic voters are not deterred from\n\nparticipation in the political process because of the effects of\n\n\n27\n     As noted, the district court found the statistics unreliable\nbecause of errors disclosed after appellees' analysis of the data.\n\n                                       - 31 -\n\fprior discrimination, including unemployment, illiteracy, and low\n\nincome.\n\n     Accordingly, the district court's ultimate finding that the\n\ncause of the Hispanic voters' lack of electoral success is failure\n\nto take advantage of political opportunity, rather than a violation\n\nof § 2, is not clearly erroneous.28\n\n                               III.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court\n\nis\n\n               AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n28\n     Because we affirm, we do not reach the lawyer disqualification\nissue raised by the District (even assuming, in light of its\nfailure to take a cross-appeal, that we could do so).\n\n                              - 32 -\n\f",

A two-day trial was held in\n\nNovember 1990; and in late February 1991, the district court\n\nentered    detailed,    exacting,    and     comprehensive        findings   and\n\nconclusions.    It found that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated\n\nlegally significant white bloc voting and entered judgment for the\n\ndefendants.\n\n     The district court made the following findings of fact,\n\nundisputed on appeal, concerning the District's election history\n\n(but, as    discussed   infra,   these      findings   do   not    reflect   the\n\nelection of two Hispanics over incumbents in May 1992):\n\n           In the forty-four years of the Board's existence,\n           there have been only twenty-three persons elected\n           to the Board.\n\n           The evidence shows that only two Hispanics[,\n           including Mr. Ritchie,] have ever been elected or\n           appointed to the Board of Trustees.4\n\n           For the first twenty-four years of the [District's]\n           existence, all elections for the Board were\n           uncontested.\n\n           In the past twelve years, there has been only one\n           contested election for the Board.    There was a\n\n\n\n3\n     The district judge found the evidence to that effect reliable.\n4\n     Plaintiffs dispute that Mr. Ritchie is Hispanic. He testified\nthat he considers himself to be Hispanic and has Hispanic heritage.\nRitchie was defeated by an Hispanic candidate in May 1992, as\ndiscussed infra.\n\n                                    - 3 -\n\f          contested election in 19845 and there were eleven\n          contested elections between 1970 and 1978.6 Thus,\n          in the history of the [District], there have been\n          only thirteen contested elections and in each case\n          the incumbent won.\n\n          In 1974 and 1976, an Anglo challenger ran against\n          an Anglo incumbent.     In both instances, the\n          incumbent won.\n\n          In ten instances, Hispanic candidates ran against\n          Anglo incumbents. In each case, the incumbent won.\n          In one election, an Hispanic challenger ran against\n          an Hispanic incumbent. The Hispanic incumbent won.7\n\n\n\n\n5\n     Josue Garza testified concerning his unsuccessful 1984\ncampaign for trustee. He opined that the large district size made\nelection difficult for candidates running at large. The District\nelicited testimony regarding his unsuccessful election history,\nincluding that the only time he had won office was in an\nuncontested election.\n6\n     Between 1970 and 1978 the Hispanic party La Raza Unida\nexercised political power in the area comprising the District. La\nraza means \"the race\" or \"the people\". The political impact of La\nRaza Unida diminished after 1978; and by the time of the Josue\nGarza campaign in 1984, association with the party was perceived as\na political liability.\n7\n     Subsequent to oral argument, the District submitted the\nresults of the May 1992 elections for two trustee positions. Those\nresults would alter several of the district court's factual\nfindings (including number of contested elections, number of\nHispanics elected, and success of Hispanic challengers against\nAnglo incumbents).      For each position, a Spanish surnamed\nchallenger defeated an incumbent. At least one of the incumbents\nwas Anglo; the other was E. W. Ritchie, whom plaintiffs claimed to\nbe Anglo, see note 4, supra. We simply note these facts; they do\nnot affect \"our review of the [district] court's conclusions\".\nMonroe v.

On the other hand, they do deflate\nappellants' assertions in their affirmative and reply briefs that\n\"[t]he proof of the pudding is the fact that no Mexican American\ncandidate has ever been able to defeat an Anglo opponent\", and that\n\"[t]he stark fact is that no Mexican American has ever defeated\n[an] Anglo in a contested race\".\n\n                              - 4 -\n\fThere has been only one runoff in the history of the District, in\n\nwhich the candidate, an Anglo, who won by a plurality in the first\n\nelection, carried a majority in the second.\n\n     At   trial,     plaintiffs    presented     evidence   of   a   strong\n\ncorrelation between race and voting in the District.                    It is\n\nundisputed here that cohesion exists among Hispanic voters, that\n\nelections are racially polarized, and that Anglos and Hispanics\n\nengage in bloc voting.         Although there was some testimony that\n\nAnglos and Hispanics coalesce around distinct sets of issues,\n\nthere was also testimony that the Board is not political and that\n\ncampaigns are not issue-driven.\n\n     Plaintiffs      offered   evidence    on   practical   inhibitors     to\n\nHispanic voting, including the effect of dual registration, \"soft\"\n\nvoting rolls that include residents who have moved,8 and the\n\nmigrant population within the District.             However, it was not\n\nestablished   that    these    phenomena   impact   Hispanic   voters    more\n\nfrequently than Anglos.9       Although a procedure exists for removing\n\nthe names of persons who have moved from the voting rolls, the\n\nparties dispute its effectiveness.\n\n8\n     Several witnesses offered anecdotal testimony concerning\npersons listed twice on the rolls (dual registration) or persons\nwho remain listed despite the fact that they have moved.\n9\n     The district court found: \"There were no studies or other\ncredible evidence presented that measured the comparative rate of\nthese phenomena by ethnic group. ... Although there was anecdotal\nevidence regarding persons registering and then moving, there were\nno studies to confirm or measure this phenomenon. ... Although\nthere was testimony that as many as ten percent of the voters on\nthe registration [rolls] had moved, plaintiffs' witnesses were able\nto identify only about one percent in precincts with which they\nwere familiar.\"\n\n                                   - 5 -\n\f     The plaintiffs contended in district court that the absence of\n\nmigrant   workers   within   the   District   at   election   time   is   a\n\nsignificant factor in Hispanic voters' inability to elect their\n\npreferred candidates. They introduced a report prepared in 1976 --\n\n14 years before trial -- by the Governor's Office of Migrant\n\nAffairs (GOMA), which lists, as of 1976, approximately 8,500\n\npersons as migrants within the three-county area.10       It stated that\n\nmigrants typically leave the District in March, April, and May, and\n\nreturn in September, October, and early November.\n\n     The district court questioned the GOMA report's accuracy and\n\nprobativeness, noting, for example, that it includes in its count\n\nall migrant family members, not just persons eligible to vote; the\n\nestimate of 8500 migrants includes those who did any migrant work\n\nin the five years before 1976 and who may have done such work for\n\nonly one day; and, the GOMA report was based on data compiled from\n\nthe 1970 census and predicted a stable migrant population for only\n\nfive to ten years -- that is, until 1981-86.11          Finally, as the\n\ndistrict court noted, plaintiffs presented no evidence on the\n\npercentage of migrants registered to vote.           Accordingly, it is\n\nunclear to what extent the absence of migrant workers from the\n\n10\n     The preface to the population figures contains the following\ndisclaimer: \"The following estimates should be taken for their\nface-value as projected estimates having restricted statistical\ntestworthiness.\"\n11\n     There was contradictory testimony concerning whether migrant\nwork was more prevalent in 1990, the time of trial, than in the\nmid-1970's. Trustee Flores testified that it was less prevalent;\nformer Commissioner Cardona, that it was more.          Plaintiffs\nintroduced no figures from the 1990 census concerning the level of\nmigrant population in the District.\n\n                                   - 6 -\n\fDistrict during an election means an absence of Hispanic registered\n\nvoters.   Plaintiffs' expert admitted:       \"I don't know that we have\n\nthe hard data that says what the political behavior of migrants\n\n[is] in the studies that we have before us.\"\n\n     The plaintiffs also contended in district court that, although\n\nHispanics   represent    a   majority   of   registered   voters   in   the\n\nDistrict, more Anglos than Hispanics actually vote in District\n\nBoard elections.    They introduced a study, based on, among others,\n\nthe 1984 and 1986 elections, which showed that more Anglo voters\n\nusually turned out and that their votes generally constituted the\n\nmajority of those cast. The district court had \"difficulty drawing\n\nany conclusions or inferences from\" the study, however, because of\n\nerrors it contained.12\n\n     As discussed    infra, the district court made findings on\n\nrelevant factors such as no discrimination against Hispanics by the\n\nDistrict, literacy and other education comparisons, and poverty\n\nlevel comparisons. In its conclusions of law, it applied Thornburg\n\nv. Gingles, albeit construing it too narrowly in some respects, as\n\nalso discussed infra, and held, inter alia, that, \"[w]here the\n\nprotected group constitutes a majority of the registered voters in\n\nan election district, [then: (1)] any Anglo bloc voting that might\n\nexist is not legally significant\"; and (2) \"the use of an at-large\n\n\n12\n     The defendants examined some of the elections depicted in the\nstudy. As the district court noted, for each election in which\ndefendants recalculated the data, the results had to be modified to\nincrease the percentage of votes cast by Hispanics and to decrease\nAnglo vote percentages. Also, the study erred in counting persons\nwith common Hispanic surnames as Anglo voters.\n\n                                  - 7 -\n\fsystem is not dilutive\".       In so holding, it cited Perea v. Town of\n\nPecos City, No. P-83-CA-22 (W.D. Tex. April 20, 1984) (pre-Gingles:\n\ndiscussed in note 14, infra) and \"dictum\" from City of Woodville.\n\nIt also held that \"[t]o the extent that at-large systems are\n\ndilutive, it is because they submerge minority groups in a district\n\ndominated by the majority\". In holding against the plaintiffs, the\n\ndistrict court made the following \"ultimate finding\":\n\n                Although there is evidence that Hispanics have\n           been underrepresented on the [District] Board, this\n           Court is hesitant to intervene when those same\n           Hispanics could readily solve this problem by\n           simply running candidates and turning out to vote.\n           While the Court is cognizant of the history of\n           discrimination that has occurred in the area, the\n           evidence presented at trial demonstrated that\n           Hispanics have been able to get elected to offices\n           in political units within the [District] when\n           significant Anglo support was required.     Finding\n           that plaintiffs enjoy the same \"opportunities [as]\n           other members of the electorate to participate in\n           the political process and to elect candidates of\n           their choice,\" this Court enters judgment for\n           defendants.\n\n                                    II.\n\n     The   Hispanic   voters    contend    that   their   registered   voter\n\nmajority status in the District does not immunize the District from\n\na § 2 attack by that majority; and that, in ruling on a § 2 claim\n\ninvolving such factors, the district court must still consider the\n\ntotality of circumstances, as opposed to denying relief solely\n\nbecause the plaintiffs cannot satisfy the three preconditions\n\nestablished in Gingles for § 2 cases challenging multimember\n\ndistricts.13   Maintaining that the district court did not consider\n\n13\n    As discussed infra, one of the district court's conclusions of\nlaw was that \"[t]he failure to establish any of the [three]\n\n                                   - 8 -\n\fthe totality of circumstances, the Hispanic voters contend that\n\nthis case must be remanded for that purpose.              Concomitantly, they\n\ncharge the district court with failing to consider properly the\n\nevidence they presented, including on the question of racially\n\npolarized   voting,   and    assert    that   its   findings     of   fact   were\n\ninsufficient under Fed. R. Civ. P. 52 standards set by this court,\n\nbecause they were not sufficiently specific and detailed and failed\n\nto state why some evidence was not considered.                  In short, they\n\ncontend that the district court's findings were clearly erroneous\n\n-- the standard of review for § 2 cases, as discussed in part II.B.\n\n                                       A.\n\n     We   first   consider    whether       plaintiffs,    as   members      of   a\n\nregistered voter majority class, are precluded, as a matter of law,\n\nfrom bringing a vote dilution claim.            We hold that they are not.\n\nOur decision in Monroe v. City of Woodville arguably rendered the\n\nsame holding.     In that multimember district case, this court\n\nfocused on plaintiffs constituting a majority of the district's\n\npopulation and held, in part:          \"Unimpeachable authority from our\n\ncircuit has rejected any per se rule that a racial minority that is\n\na majority in a political subdivision cannot experience vote\n\ndilution.... Such a case is not ... precluded as a matter of law.\"\n\n881 F.2d at 1333.     Here, however, Hispanics constitute not only a\n\nsizable population majority, but also a registered voter majority.\n\n\n\nThornburg preconditions is fatal to the plaintiffs' case and\nprecludes the necessity of considering the Zimmer factors or other\nproof.

This is an issue of first impression in our\n\ncircuit.14    Needless    to   say,   constituting    a   registered   voter\n\nmajority is far more significant in a voting rights case than\n\nsimply being a population majority.            This notwithstanding, as\n\ndiscussed    below,   a   protected   group   --   even   when   it   is   the\n\nregistered voter majority -- may seek relief in a vote dilution\n\ncase.   Whether it can obtain relief is, of course, a question of\n\nproof, as discussed in part II.B.2.\n\n     Because this is a case of first impression, we replow quite\n\nfamiliar voting rights ground, in order to establish a firm and\n\nsure bedding for laying the \"totality of circumstances\" path that\n\nwe must follow in order to reach our destination.           The path is not\n\nlong, but it must be straight and sure.              It travels over, and\n\ntouches, many obvious basic, and quite sensitive, bedrock national\n\nprinciples and issues.      Many of the battles that helped clear this\n\nground were fought long ago; others, in the not too distant past.\n\nThe memory of them is most painful, but we are equally mindful of\n\nour limited role as we make this journey.\n\n\n\n14\n     In Perea v.

See, e.g., id. at 46 (discussing\n\nsubmergence of black votes in a white majority); id. at 51 (to\n\nestablish white bloc voting, \"the minority group demonstrates that\n\nsubmergence in a white multimember district impedes its ability to\n\nelect its chosen representatives\"); id. at 68 (\"vote dilution\n\nthrough submergence in a white majority\").\n\n      As stated, just as this court has rejected a per se rule that\n\npopulation majority groups cannot experience vote dilution through\n\nuse of an at-large system, we hold that a protected class that is\n\nalso a registered voter majority is not foreclosed, as a matter of\n\nlaw, from raising a vote dilution claim.           First, the Voting Rights\n\nAct protects racial and language minorities; it does not focus on\n\nthe vote dilution a group experiences merely because it is the\n\nnumerical minority.          Second, the same reasons counseling that\n\npopulation majorities may experience vote dilution suggest that the\n\nsame may occur where the protected class is a voting age population\n\nmajority, or even a registered voter majority.                  Minority groups\n\n(protected classes) do not lose the protection of the Voting Rights\n\nAct   when    they    are   no   longer   population      or   registered   voter\n\nminorities in a political subdivision; the Act is directed at their\n\nstatus   as    a     national    racial   or   language    minority.        It   is\n\nconceivable that an election structure could dilute a registered\n\nvoter majority's vote or that low turnout, among a group registered\n\n\n                                     - 18 -\n\fin    high   percentages,   could   result   from    a    Voting   Rights   Act\n\nviolation.     Obviously, plaintiffs must prove it.          And, third, the\n\nSupreme Court has instructed that,\n\n             in evaluating a statutory claim of vote dilution\n             through districting, the trial court is to consider\n             the `totality of the circumstances' and to\n             determine, based `upon a searching practical\n             evaluation of the \"past and present reality,\"'\n             whether the political process is equally open to\n             minority   voters.      `\"This   determination   is\n             peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case\"'.\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (quoting S.

Section 2(b) provides in full:\n\n                A violation of subsection (a) of this section\n           is established if, based on the totality of\n           circumstances, it is shown that the political\n           processes leading to nomination or election in the\n           State or political subdivision are not equally open\n           to participation by members of a class of citizens\n           protected by subsection (a) of this section in that\n           its members have less opportunity than other\n           members of the electorate to participate in the\n           political process and to elect representatives of\n           their choice.   The extent to which members of a\n           protected class have been elected to office in the\n           State or political subdivision is one circumstance\n           which may be considered: Provided, That nothing in\n           this section establishes a right to have members of\n           a protected class elected in numbers equal to their\n           proportion in the population.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(b) (underlining added).        As discussed infra, in a\n\nmultimember or at-large challenge, where the protected class is\n\nalso the registered voter majority, the \"totality of circumstances\"\n\nanalysis becomes even more significant.

These circumstances are\n           necessary preconditions for multimember districts\n           to operate to impair minority voters' ability to\n           elect representatives of their choice for the\n           following reasons. First, the minority group must\n           be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently\n           large and geographically compact to constitute a\n           majority in a single-member district. ...

As\n\ndiscussed below, a critical question in this case is whether the\n\nplaintiffs must prove all three preconditions before the district\n\ncourt   considers       whether,      in   light    of    the   \"totality   of\n\ncircumstances\", the challenged practice is dilutive.\n\n     We review under the clearly erroneous standard the district\n\ncourt's findings concerning (1) the three Gingles preconditions,\n\n(2) the factors relevant to the totality of circumstances analysis;\n\nand (3) vote dilution (the ultimate finding).              Westwego III, 946\n\nF.2d at 1118 & n.13.      It is well to revisit the holding in Gingles\n\non the standard of review, part of which was quoted earlier:\n\n                We reaffirm our view that the clearly-\n           erroneous test of Rule 52(a) is the appropriate\n           standard for appellate review of a finding of vote\n           dilution. As both amended § 2 and its legislative\n           history make clear, in evaluating a statutory claim\n           of vote dilution through districting, the trial\n           court is to consider the \"totality of the\n           circumstances\" and to determine, based \"upon a\n\n                                      - 22 -\n\f          searching practical evaluation of the `past and\n          present reality,'\" whether the political process is\n          equally   open   to  minority    voters.     \"`This\n          determination is peculiarly dependent upon the\n          facts of each case,'\" and requires \"an intensely\n          local appraisal of the design and impact\" of the\n          contested electoral mechanisms.      The fact that\n          amended § 2 and its legislative history provide\n          legal standards which a court must apply to the\n          facts in order to determine whether § 2 has been\n          violated does not alter the standard of review. As\n          we explained in Bose [Corp. v. Consumers Union of\n          U.S., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984)], Rule 52(a) \"does\n          not inhibit an appellate court's power to correct\n          errors of law, including those that may infect a\n          so-called mixed finding of law and fact, or a\n          finding   of   fact  that   is   predicated  on   a\n          misunderstanding of the governing rule of law.\"\n          Thus, the application of the clearly-erroneous\n          standard to ultimate findings of vote dilution\n          preserves the benefit of the trial court's\n          particular   familiarity    with   the   indigenous\n          political reality without endangering the rule of\n          law.\n\n478 U.S. at 79 (citations omitted; emphasis added).     And, as is\n\nmore than well established, a finding of fact is clearly erroneous\n\n\"only when although there may be evidence to support it, the\n\nreviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite\n\nand firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"   Westwego\n\nIII, 946 F.2d at 1118.\n\n                                 1.\n\n     The district court found for plaintiffs on the first two\n\nGingles preconditions, Hispanics could constitute a majority in a\n\nsingle member district and are politically cohesive; and the\n\nDistrict does not contest those findings.      Therefore, the only\n\nprecondition in issue is the third -- whether white bloc voting\n\nexists that usually operates to defeat the protected class's\n\npreferred candidate.

In Overton, however, as in other decisions by\n\nthis court stating that same rule, the protected class was not a\n\npopulation, or other, majority.      See, e.g., Westwego III, 946 F.2d\n\nat 1116, 1120; East Jefferson, 926 F.2d at 491.       On the other hand,\n\nin City of Woodville, this court noted that this third Gingles\n\nprecondition may not be the appropriate test for analyzing vote\n\ndilution claims in a jurisdiction with a protected class that is a\n\npopulation majority.    This is because in Gingles, as noted, the\n\nCourt was dealing with a case where black voters were a distinct\n\npopulation minority and where the evil they complained of was\n\nsubmergence in a white multimember district.          Gingles discussed\n\nthe third precondition against this factual backdrop:\n\n            In establishing this last circumstance [legally\n            significant white bloc voting], the minority group\n            demonstrates   that   submergence   in   a   white\n            multimember district impedes its ability to elect\n            its chosen representatives.\n\n478 U.S. at 51; see also City of Woodville, 881 F.2d at 1333.\n\nWhether this third precondition \"was intended to address\" a vote\n\n\n                                  - 24 -\n\fdilution claim where the protected class is the majority, is, this\n\ncourt noted, \"a matter of speculation among several possible\n\ninterpretations.\"     Id.24    This court did not linger long over this\n\nquestion,    noting    immediately       the   overriding     totality   of\n\ncircumstances question:\n\n            The issue is, however, ultimately irrelevant\n            because irrespective of [Gingles'] meaning in a\n            case like this, Zimmer's holding clearly was not\n            abandoned when Congress amended Section 2.\n\n                 Because we have already concluded that a\n            [Gingles] vote dilution claim is foreclosed here by\n            lack of black political cohesion, and we conclude\n            in the following discussion that a Zimmer totality\n            of circumstances dilution claim was not proven by\n            appellants, we need not opine further on this\n            puzzling aspect of [Gingles].\n\nId. at 1333-34 (emphasis added).         The City of Woodville court had\n\nstated earlier that \"[t]he [Gingles] threshold analysis does not\n\nreplace   the   totality      of   circumstances   inquiry,   the   ultimate\n\ndetermination to be made under Section 2.\"               Id. at 1330 n.4\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     In any event, for a case of the type presented here, Gingles\n\noffers guidance on how the third precondition is to be applied.\n\nThe Court noted that \"[t]he amount of white bloc voting that can\n\ngenerally `minimize or cancel' [minority] voters' ability to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice ... will vary from district to\n\ndistrict according to a number of factors\".         478 U.S. at 56.

Id.   The Court\n\nconcluded that whether the evidence of racial bloc voting \"rises to\n\nthe level of legal significance under § 2\" will depend on the\n\nfactual circumstances of each case and that, accordingly, \"there is\n\nno simple doctrinal test for the existence of legally significant\n\nracial bloc voting.\"   Id. at 57-58.\n\n     We, as did the City of Woodville panel, find the third\n\nprecondition difficult to apply in a case such as this.   But, like\n\nthat panel, we stay fixed on, and follow, the controlling totality\n\nof circumstances path and do not tarry long, or wander off, in\n\npursuit of trying to fashion some alternative third (white bloc\n\nvoting) precondition for instances where the protected class is, in\n\nfact, the majority.25 It is useful, however, to recall that a court\n\nanalyzes the legal significance of racial bloc voting in order to\n\n25\n     For example, the Supreme Court established the three\npreconditions for mounting a multimember challenge because, if the\nplaintiffs lacked the potential to elect representatives in a\nsmaller, single member district, then such alternative, single\nmember districts, would not constitute relief, nor would the at-\nlarge district be cause of § 2 injury. See, e.g., Gingles, 478\nU.S. at 48-51, 48 n.15, 50 n.16. The District contends that the\nat-large structure is to the Hispanic voters' advantage, asserting\nthat, because they are a voter majority, they can elect candidates\nof their choice to each and every position on the District's Board.\nBut, because the Hispanic voters are such a majority, and because\nof their arguable, if not proven, lack of electoral success, then\nanother factor is arguably inhibiting, if not preventing, such\nsuccess. Under various complex theories, it can be contended that\nall three Gingles preconditions are applicable when the protected\nclass is a population, or other, majority; under other equally\ncomplex theories, that the third precondition, concerning usual\neffectiveness of white bloc voting, is not applicable. But, the\nplain command of § 2, to follow the totality of circumstances,\nbrings this complex and intriguing puzzle to a merciful end; and we\nresume our journey on its path.\n\n                              - 26 -\n\fanswer a   more   ultimate    question,    namely,   \"the    impact   of   the\n\ncontested structure or practice on minority electoral opportunities\n\n`on the basis of objective factors.'\"          Gingles, 478 U.S. at 44.\n\nConcomitantly, it is the plaintiffs' burden, in order to justify\n\nrelief, to \"prove that the use of a multimember electoral structure\n\noperates to minimize or cancel out their ability to elect their\n\npreferred candidates.\"       Id. at 48.\n\n     Underlying these functions of the court and the plaintiffs in\n\na multimember district vote dilution case is an inquiry into\n\ncausation -- whether the given electoral practice is responsible\n\nfor plaintiffs' inability to elect their preferred representatives.\n\nLikewise, the Supreme Court, in measuring legally significant white\n\nbloc voting, aims at determining whether it is racial voting\n\npatterns, along with other objective factors, rather than some\n\nother set of causes, that explain the lack of electoral success of\n\nvoters within the protected class.           Accordingly, in analyzing\n\nlegally significant white bloc voting in a case where the protected\n\nclass is also a population, registered voter, or other majority,\n\nthe third Gingles precondition requires an inquiry into the causal\n\nrelationship between the challenged practice and the lack of\n\nelectoral success by the protected class voters.            First, is voting\n\npolarized along racial lines?        Second, given that the protected\n\nclass voters are the registered voter majority in the district, is\n\ntheir inability to elect their preferred representatives caused\n\nprimarily by racial bloc voting or, instead, by other circumstances\n\nwhich the Act does not redress?\n\n\n                                  - 27 -\n\f      Concerning racial polarization in voting, the district court\n\nfound:\n\n             The analysis of the electoral evidence plaintiffs\n             presented indicates a very high degree of support\n             by Hispanics for Hispanic candidates. That is to\n             say that a Hispanic candidate running against an\n             Anglo opponent always receives the majority of the\n             Hispanic vote.\n\nIt did not make a finding concerning Anglo bloc voting, but the\n\nDistrict concedes it in its brief here.              As noted, the district\n\ncourt cited Town of Pecos City (pre-Gingles; used totality of\n\ncircumstances analysis) and \"dictum\" from City of Woodville to\n\nconclude that \"[w]here the protected group constitutes a majority\n\nof the registered voters in an election district, any Anglo bloc\n\nvoting that might exist is not legally significant.\"                 (Emphasis\n\nadded.)      But, as also noted, its subsequent, ultimate finding was\n\nthat the true cause for lack of Hispanic electoral success was not\n\nunequal electoral opportunity, but rather the failure of Hispanic\n\nvoters to take advantage of that opportunity:                \"[T]his Court is\n\nhesitant to intervene when those same Hispanics could readily solve\n\nthis problem by simply running candidates and turning out to vote.\"\n\n      Accordingly, notwithstanding the district court's absolute\n\nunderlying holding, its opinion should not be read to hold that, as\n\na   matter    of    law,    Anglo   bloc   voting   cannot   ever   be    legally\n\nsignificant        whenever   the   protected   class   also   constitutes     a\n\nregistered voter majority.          As discussed, neither of the cases it\n\ncited, City of Woodville and Town of Pecos City, so held.                 And, as\n\nthe   Supreme       Court     has   instructed,     determining     the    legal\n\nsignificance of white bloc voting is a factual inquiry that will\n\n                                      - 28 -\n\fvary with the circumstances of each case.       Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57-\n\n58.\n\n      Although a registered voter majority class faces an obvious,\n\ndifficult burden in proving that their inability to elect results\n\nfrom white bloc voting, they are not precluded, as a matter of law,\n\nfrom seeking to prove such a claim.      In deciding such a majority's\n\nclaim, the district court looks to the totality of circumstances.\n\nIn doing so, it need not base its finding on any particular Zimmer\n\nfactor or configuration of factors.        \"No one of the factors is\n\ndispositive; the plaintiffs need not prove a majority of them;\n\nother factors may be relevant.\"     Westwego III, 946 F.2d at 1120.\n\nSee id. n.16 (listing the factors); Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45.\n\nNotwithstanding some of its conclusions of law, as discussed above,\n\nwe disagree with the Hispanic voters' contention that the district\n\ncourt failed   to   properly   consider,   or   make   findings   on,   the\n\ntotality of circumstances factors in this case, as discussed below.\n\nIn the alternative, and assuming arguendo that the district court\n\ndid not proceed beyond a conclusion that failure to satisfy the\n\nthird Gingles precondition ended the dispute, we hold that the\n\nfindings of fact by the district court satisfy the totality of\n\ncircumstances test and are, therefore, sufficient to uphold its\n\njudgment, as also demonstrated below.\n\n                                  2.\n\n      In attempting to meet this burden of proof under the totality\n\nof circumstances, the protected class -- that is also some form of\n\nmajority -- may attempt to prove, for example, that its registered\n\n\n                                - 29 -\n\fvoter majority is illusory, as plaintiffs attempted here.                             They\n\nintroduced evidence of \"soft\" voting rolls that included residents\n\nwho    had   moved   away       and    double    listings    for    the    same    voter.\n\nHowever, as the district court found, plaintiffs failed to provide\n\ncredible studies.          Their evidence consisted mainly of anecdotal\n\ntestimony in which witnesses only identified a small number of\n\ninaccuracies in voter lists per precinct.                      The plaintiffs also\n\nfailed to prove that \"soft\" voting rolls implicated Hispanics more\n\nheavily than Anglos.         The district court's findings concerning the\n\nvoting rolls were not clearly erroneous.\n\n       As another example, plaintiffs might be able to prove that a\n\nregistered     voter      majority      was     illusory,    because      of   practical\n\nimpediments to voting.           In this case, they attempted to prove that\n\na significant portion of the Hispanic population was unavailable to\n\nvote    on   the   date    of    the    election,      because     of   migrant       work.\n\nHowever, the district court did not credit that evidence, because\n\nnone was presented that reliably proved (1) the extent of the\n\nmigrant      population     at    the    time     of   the   trial;26     or    (2)    what\n\npercentage of migrant workers are registered voters.                           Plaintiffs\n\nalso failed to prove the inadequacy of absentee voting procedures\n\nto allow migrant workers absent from the District to vote.                             The\n\ndistrict     court's      findings      that     the   Hispanic    registered         voter\n\nmajority was not illusory are not clearly erroneous.\n\n\n\n26\n     As noted, the plaintiffs relied on the 1976 GOMA study that\nprojected stable migrant populations only until 1981-86, whereas\nthe trial was conducted in 1990.\n\n                                          - 30 -\n\f       As another example, plaintiffs could conceivably prove that,\n\ndespite a registered voter majority, low turnout at elections was\n\nthe result of prior official discrimination.                        E.g., Graves v.\n\nBarnes,     343   F.    Supp.   at     733    (\"the     reason      that    the   voter\n\nparticipation among the Mexican-Americans is so low is that their\n\nvoting patterns were established under precisely the same sort of\n\ndiscriminatory State actions that we have already found both\n\nrelevant    and   condemnatory        with    regard    to    the    Dallas    Blacks\"\n\n(emphasis in original)).        Plaintiffs would face a difficult burden\n\nof proof; but, as this court noted in Westwego Citizens for Better\n\nGov't v. City of Westwego (Westwego I), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521914\"><a href=\"/opinion/521914/westwego-citizens-for-better-government-v-city-of-westwego-a-municipal/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1212 (5th\n\nCir.    1989),    \"Congress     and     the    courts     have      recognized    that\n\n`political participation by minorities tends to be depressed where\n\nminority group members suffer effects of prior discrimination'\".\n\n(Quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 69).               Here, plaintiffs introduced\n\nevidence of disputed accuracy that, at some Board elections,\n\nHispanic turnout was roughly seven percentage points below that of\n\nAnglos.27    However, they offered no evidence directly linking this\n\nlow turnout with past official discrimination.                          Obviously, a\n\nprotected class is not entitled to § 2 relief merely because it\n\nturns out in a lower percentage than whites to vote.                       Further, the\n\nhigh   incidence       of   Hispanic    registration         in   the      District   is\n\npersuasive evidence that Hispanic voters are not deterred from\n\nparticipation in the political process because of the effects of\n\n\n27\n     As noted, the district court found the statistics unreliable\nbecause of errors disclosed after appellees' analysis of the data.\n\n                                       - 31 -\n\fprior discrimination, including unemployment, illiteracy, and low\n\nincome.\n\n     Accordingly, the district court's ultimate finding that the\n\ncause of the Hispanic voters' lack of electoral success is failure\n\nto take advantage of political opportunity, rather than a violation\n\nof § 2, is not clearly erroneous.28\n\n                               III.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court\n\nis\n\n               AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n28\n     Because we affirm, we do not reach the lawyer disqualification\nissue raised by the District (even assuming, in light of its\nfailure to take a cross-appeal, that we could do so).\n\n                              - 32 -\n\f</pre>",
