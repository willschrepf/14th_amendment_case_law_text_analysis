(Pen.\n\nCode, § 187, subd. (a).)1, 2 The trial court sentenced defendant to prison for an\n\nindeterminate term of 25 years to life. Defendant raises six issues on appeal. First,\n\ndefendant contends the trial court erred by, in the last moments of trial, deciding to\n\ninstruct the jury on an aiding and abetting theory of guilt that was never discussed or\n\nlitigated. Second, defendant asserts the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on\n\nthe lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. (§ 192, subd. (b).) Third,\n\ndefendant contends the trial court erred by not instructing the jury that it could convict\n\ndefendant of second degree murder if it found defendant did not premeditate the murder\n\nor lie in wait for the victim. Fourth, defendant asserts the trial court erred by admitting\n\ntestimony from a witness who had an agreement with the State. Fifth, defendant\n\ncontends the trial court erred by not instructing the jury that an accomplice‟s testimony\n\nmust be corroborated. Sixth, defendant asserts the trial court erred by not instructing the\n\njury on unanimity. We affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n       1   All subsequent statutory references will be to the Penal Code unless indicated.\n\n       2 The jury found not true the allegations that defendant (1) personally used a\nfirearm during the commission of the felony (§ 12022.5. subd. (a)), and (2) personally\nand intentionally discharged a firearm proximately causing the victim‟s death\n(§ 12022.53, subd. (d)). We note the minute order reflects the jury found a gang\nallegation to not be true (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)); however, this appears to be a\ntypographical error, as it does not appear any gang allegations were set forth in the\ninformation.\n\n                                             2\n\f                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       A.     THE CRIME\n\n       In April 2006, the victim, an adult male, lived in an apartment in Adelanto. Also\n\nliving in the apartment were (1) the victim‟s fiancée (Mother), (2) Mother‟s mother\n\n(Grandmother), and (3) Mother‟s children. During April 2006, Mother was hospitalized\n\nfor kidney issues. The victim moved into the apartment with Mother‟s family in\n\napproximately February 2006, and helped Grandmother take care of Mother‟s children.\n\nMother had a 13-year-old son named Adrian, a 15-year-old son named Fernando\n\n(hereinafter “the brothers”), and two other sons.\n\n       On April 22, 2006, at approximately 8:00 or 9:00 p.m., Adrian, Fernando, and\n\ntheir cousin were walking through the apartment complex on their way to the brothers‟\n\napartment. The boys were stopped by a group of six or seven individuals, who were\n\nhaving a party in a carport. Three of the individuals, who were young men, approached\n\nthe boys and asked where the boys were from. The boys stopped to hear what the\n\nyoung men were saying. The young men spoke to Fernando about the Los Angeles\n\nDodgers hat he was wearing. The young men asked if Fernando was in a gang and why\n\nhe was wearing the Los Angeles hat. Fernando recognized one of the young men as a\n\nresident of the apartment complex, Jose Villafana (Villafana). The boys did not\n\nrespond, and continued walking.\n\n       One of the young men, Elias Arzate (Arzate), shoved Fernando. Fernando told\n\nArzate he had no reason to fight Arzate, and Fernando kept walking to his apartment.\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\fDefendant often spent time with Villafana in the apartment complex. Fernando could\n\nnot recall if defendant was at the carport party, but defendant‟s friends were at the party.\n\n       When the boys arrived at the brothers‟ apartment, Adrian called Mother at the\n\nhospital to tell her about the confrontation with the individuals in the carport. Mother\n\ntold Adrian to stay inside the apartment. The victim was at the hospital visiting Mother\n\nwhen Adrian called. That night, when the victim arrived home from visiting Mother,\n\nAdrian told the victim about the confrontation. The brothers stayed inside the apartment\n\nfor the rest of the night.\n\n       At approximately noon the following day, April 23, the brothers were on their\n\npatio, which is surrounded by a wooden fence. Fernando saw Arzate walk by, toward\n\nVillafana‟s apartment. Villafana‟s apartment was approximately 10 to 15 feet away\n\nfrom the brothers‟ apartment. Arzate “mad dogged” (confrontationally stared at) the\n\nbrothers, as Arzate walked through the apartment complex. Adrian told the victim\n\nabout Arzate staring at him and Fernando. The victim saw “the look” on the brothers‟\n\nfaces. The victim went to Villafana‟s apartment.\n\n       The victim knocked on Villafana‟s apartment door, and spoke to Villafana and\n\nArzate. The victim told Villafana and Arzate that if they “have any kinds of problems\n\nwith [his] kids to go and talk to [the victim] about it.” Villafana and Arzate looked\n\ndown as though they were ashamed of their actions—an argument did not take place.\n\nThe victim returned to his apartment.\n\n       The victim was a habitual smoker, who stepped outside the apartment\n\napproximately every 30 minutes to smoke a cigarette. At approximately 10:30 p.m., the\n\n\n                                             4\n\fvictim went outside the apartment to smoke a cigarette. Gunshots were fired. Fernando\n\ncalled 911 and locked the front door. Grandmother yelled that she thought the victim\n\nwas shot. Adrian woke up, opened the front door, and saw the victim lying in front of\n\nthe door, face down in a “puddle of blood . . . with his eyes open.” Fernando saw the\n\nvictim and called 911 again to report the victim was shot.\n\n       The brothers turned the victim face-up, and Adrian spoke to the victim, but the\n\nvictim did not respond. Approximately 30 seconds after being turned over, the victim\n\nstopped breathing. The victim typically carried a flip-type handyman‟s knife in his\n\npocket. Adrian did not see the knife on the ground next to the victim; Adrian believed\n\nthe knife was still in the victim‟s pocket.\n\n       B.     THE INVESTIGATION\n\n       Sheriff‟s Detective Myler investigated the victim‟s death. When Myler arrived at\n\nthe apartment complex on April 23 he saw the victim was deceased. Myler noticed two\n\ngunshot wounds on the front of the victim‟s left shoulder, one of which was near the\n\nvictim‟s neck, and a third gunshot wound on the victim‟s right lower back area. The\n\nvictim died as a result of the gunshot wounds.\n\n       Myler spoke to people in the neighborhood. As a result of those interviews,\n\nMyler identified Villafana and Villafana‟s friends as possible suspects. Also as a result\n\nof the interviews, Myler checked the fence line on the northern end of the apartment\n\ncomplex to determine if anyone had jumped over it. Myler found dirt on top of the\n\nchain-link fence railing in three different locations, not far from one another.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f        Sheriff‟s Detective Mahoney also investigated the victim‟s death. Mahoney\n\nspoke to Grandmother and the brothers. After speaking with the family, Mahoney\n\nidentified Villafana and Arzate as suspects. Villafana was not at his apartment when\n\nMahoney went to speak to him that night. Mahoney began investigating a third possible\n\nsuspect after speaking to more people; the third suspect was defendant.\n\n        The detectives decided to take a break and reconvene later in the day. As four of\n\nthe law enforcement officers were driving their separate cars in a caravan, Mahoney saw\n\nthree people walking through a field. The people matched the descriptions of the three\n\nsuspects: (1) defendant, with a clean-shaven head, Hispanic, and with a somewhat large\n\nstature; and (2) Villafana and Arzate who were Hispanic, “smaller,” and “skinny.”\n\nMahoney used his telephone to call Sheriff‟s Detective Shenton to assist him in\n\ncontacting the people in the field.\n\n        Mahoney and Shenton stopped their cars in the field, near the three suspects, who\n\nwere Villafana, Arzate, and defendant. Shenton asked Villafana and Arzate to come\n\nover to his vehicle. Mahoney asked defendant to come to his vehicle. The three men\n\n“nonchalantly approached” the detectives. Defendant allowed Mahoney to pat him\n\ndown. Mahoney did not find any weapons. Defendant told Mahoney his name, which\n\nmatched the first name of the suspect Mahoney was looking for—Mahoney did not have\n\nthe suspect‟s last name. Mahoney had never known a Hispanic person by the name of\n\nKirk, so he was surprised when defendant said his name was the same as the suspect‟s\n\nname.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f       Mahoney stepped away from defendant, in order to call Sergeant Bolt (Bolt).\n\nMahoney told Bolt, “[W]e found them. You need to turn around.” Bolt had continued\n\non in the caravan when Mahoney and Shenton stopped in the field. Defendant\n\noverheard Mahoney and began running away. Mahoney chased after defendant.\n\nDefendant ran to his residence. Defendant‟s girlfriend (Rincon), was standing outside\n\nthe residence, behind a chain-link fence. Rincon yelled at defendant to stop running.\n\n       Defendant ran into his yard, circled the house twice, gave Rincon a kiss, and then\n\njumped over a block wall into an apartment complex. Mahoney instructed defendant to\n\nstop running, and followed defendant into the apartment complex. Defendant jumped\n\nover a fence into another apartment complex. Mahoney jumped over the fence as well.\n\nMahoney saw defendant enter an apartment. Mahoney called Bolt, who used his radio\n\nto direct other deputies.\n\n       Uniformed deputies with shotguns entered the apartment. Defendant was\n\nhandcuffed and escorted out of the apartment. Two other people were inside the\n\napartment; the people inside the apartment were related to Rincon. Defendant was\n\ntransported to the Adelanto substation to be interviewed. Mahoney went back to\n\ndefendant‟s residence to interview Rincon. Rincon agreed to assist Mahoney with\n\nlooking for a weapon. Rincon walked into the backyard, and Mahoney followed her.\n\nRincon stopped next to one of the ventilation grates on the exterior of the house (the\n\ngrates are located every 10 feet along the floor area of the house). Rincon pushed her\n\nhand through the screen mesh, and the mesh fell back. Rincon pointed Mahoney toward\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\fthe area where the mesh fell away. A deputy reached through and pulled out a .357\n\nMagnum revolver wrapped in a shirt.\n\n       Mahoney spoke to Rincon‟s brother (Jose). Jose told Mahoney that late at night\n\non April 22, he saw Villafana holding a revolver. Villafana was in a car stopped along\n\nthe road, and a another person, whom Jose did not recognize, was also in the car. Jose\n\ndescribed the gun, and the description was consistent with the .357 Magnum found at\n\ndefendant‟s residence. Jose assumed Villafana and the second person “were up to no\n\ngood.” Mahoney returned to the station to interview defendant, Arzate, and Villafana.\n\n       C.     ARZATE‟S TESTIMONY\n\n       Arzate testified at defendant‟s trial. Arzate was wearing an orange jumpsuit and\n\nwas in the custody of San Bernardino County due to murder charges related to the\n\nvictim. Arzate entered into an agreement with the prosecutor. The agreement\n\ncontemplated Arzate‟s truthful testimony against defendant in exchange for entering a\n\nplea to manslaughter (§ 192) and a gang enhancement (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)). Arzate\n\nwould receive a prison sentence of 16 years, which could be served outside of\n\nCalifornia. The trial court stated it did not believe anyone had the authority to promise\n\na prison sentence could be served outside of California. Arzate‟s plea deal was not\n\nsolidified prior to his testimony. Thus, if Arzate‟s testimony were not truthful, the\n\nprosecutor could renege on the deal. Arzate expressed concern that his testimony\n\nagainst defendant would lead to him being stabbed in prison and/or Arzate‟s sister being\n\nharmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f      Arzate met defendant in February 2006 through Villafana. Arzate supplied\n\nmethamphetamines to defendant, for defendant to sell. Arzate visited defendant‟s house\n\non a weekly basis, but they were not friends. Arzate met Villafana in school in 1998 or\n\n1999, and they were friends. Arzate is a member of the 41st Street gang in South\n\nCentral Los Angeles. Defendant is a member of the Seventh Street West Side Verdugo\n\ngang. Defendant‟s gang nickname is Little Joker. Villafana was possibly a member of\n\nthe Westside Wilmington gang.\n\n      Arzate denied shooting a gun in April 2006. On April 23, 2006, Arzate and\n\nVillafana went to Palm Springs during the day. The two returned to Villafana‟s\n\napartment at approximately 7:00 p.m. When Arzate went outside to get something out\n\nof the car, a teenager was “mad dogging” Arzate. Arzate stared back at the teenager and\n\nthen reentered Villafana‟s apartment. A few minutes later, the victim knocked on\n\nVillafana‟s apartment door.\n\n      Arzate thought the victim was “kind of aggressive” and noticed the knife on the\n\nvictim‟s belt. The victim asked Arzate if he had a problem with the victim‟s “nephew.”\n\nBefore Arzate could answer, the victim asked Villafana if he had a problem with the\n\nvictim‟s nephew. Arzate felt disrespected by the victim, because the victim did not give\n\nArzate an opportunity to answer, before questioning Villafana. Arzate asked the victim\n\nif the victim‟s nephew had a problem with them. The victim said, “no.” Arzate\n\nresponded, “[T]here‟s your answer,” and then closed the door. Villafana asked what\n\nhad happened earlier to cause the victim to come to Villafana‟s apartment. Arzate said\n\na teenager outside the victim‟s apartment was looking at Arzate, so he “looked at him\n\n\n                                           9\n\fback.” Villafana and Arzate stayed at Villafana‟s apartment for one or two hours, and\n\nthen went to defendant‟s house to give him drugs.\n\n       Upon arriving at defendant‟s house, Arzate, Villafana, and defendant smoked\n\nmethamphetamines. The three men discussed the incident with the teenager staring at\n\nArzate and the victim coming to Villafana‟s house. Arzate told defendant he felt as\n\nthough the victim was disrespecting him. Defendant “[p]ulled out a gun” from his\n\nwaistband. Defendant said, “I‟ll smoke that fool.” Arzate said the victim “didn‟t\n\ndeserve that.” Arzate said he would rather fight the victim, because the victim asked\n\nVillafana a question without giving Arzate an opportunity to respond to the previous\n\nquestion. Villafana told the two men to “leave it alone,” but also agreed to “jump” the\n\nvictim. Defendant said he wanted to kill the victim. Arzate later learned defendant had\n\nprior problems with the victim.\n\n       Arzate became upset because defendant wanted to kill the victim, so Arzate\n\nwalked outside. After 30 minutes, Arzate went back inside the house. Defendant asked\n\nArzate what he wanted to do, and Arzate said he wanted to fight the victim. Defendant\n\nsaid he would put the gun away. The men continued to smoke, and then went to the\n\nvictim‟s apartment complex, in order for Arzate to fight the victim.\n\n       Villafana and defendant knew the victim went outside every night at 10:00 p.m.\n\nto smoke a cigarette. The three men planned to wait for the victim to exit his apartment\n\nto smoke a cigarette. Arzate and Villafana would wait across the street while defendant\n\nwould wait in the carport area. Defendant would initiate the fight by rushing at the\n\nvictim. Defendant had a black bandana around his neck and gloves on his hands.\n\n\n                                           10\n\fDefendant asked Arzate to unscrew three light bulbs in the carport area, and Arzate\n\ncomplied. Villafana stayed hidden across the street.\n\n       Arzate began walking back toward Villafana, across the street. While walking,\n\nArzate saw the victim and pointed defendant to where the victim was standing. Arzate\n\nsaw defendant lift his shirt and pull “something” out. Arzate heard the victim say,\n\n“[N]o,” and then heard a gunshot. After the first gunshot, Arzate ducked down and\n\nthought, “[W]hat the fuck[?]” Arzate stood up, saw the gun in defendant‟s hand, saw\n\nthe flare from the gun being shot, heard three more gunshots, and told Villafana they\n\nshould run. The two men began running and jumped over a fence. Defendant caught up\n\nto the men, and ran with them.\n\n       The men ran to Arzate‟s apartment. Defendant removed the bandana, gloves,\n\nand his shirt. Arzate put the clothes in a bag and gave the bag to a woman at his\n\napartment. The woman took the bag. The three men then drove around Adelanto “for a\n\nlittle bit.” Arzate asked defendant why he killed the victim. Defendant responded that\n\n“he wanted [the victim] dead.” Villafana was quiet. Arzate told defendant that if\n\nArzate were arrested, then defendant should “stand up for what he did.” Arzate was\n\nupset with defendant. Defendant told Arzate, “[D]on‟t trip: That [I] got it.” Defendant\n\ntold Villafana he should have seen the face the victim made prior to dying. Villafana\n\nremained quiet. Arzate continued pushing defendant to take responsibility for the\n\noffense if the men were arrested. Defendant pulled out the gun and said, “[I] gots (sic)\n\nit,” and not to worry.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f       The three men returned to defendant‟s house. Defendant gave Villafana the gun\n\nand told Villafana to empty the gun and clean it. Defendant went upstairs with Rincon.\n\nVillafana and Arzate spent the night at defendant‟s house. Villafana returned the gun to\n\ndefendant. The following day (April 24) at approximately 11:00 a.m., the three men\n\nwalked to the store to purchase diapers for defendant and Rincon‟s newborn son, and\n\nwere arrested during the walk.\n\n       Mahoney interviewed Arzate. Arzate was not truthful with the detective during\n\nthe interview. Arzate told Mahoney he had argued with gang members from La Puente\n\nearlier in the day and was at the apartment complex to retaliate against the gang\n\nmembers. Arzate explained he was at the complex during the shooting, but only\n\nbecause he was looking for the gang members. Arzate then changed his story and\n\nclaimed he was not present at the complex during the shooting, but defendant told him\n\nabout the killing.\n\n       Eventually, Arzate changed his story and admitted being at the apartment\n\ncomplex to confront the victim. Arzate told Mahoney about the victim coming to\n\nVillafana‟s apartment door to talk to them. Arzate identified defendant as the person\n\nwho killed the victim. Arzate told Mahoney about the bag of clothing and instructed the\n\nwoman at the apartment to give the bag to the detective.\n\n       Arzate was taken into custody in 2006, and remained in custody through\n\ndefendant‟s trial in May 2011. After defendant spoke to Mahoney about what happened\n\non the night of the shooting, Arzate suffered fights in jail. Over the years, Arzate has\n\ncontinued to suffer fights in jail due to making a statement to Mahoney. In March 2011,\n\n\n                                            12\n\fArzate made the decision to testify against defendant. Arzate made the decision\n\nbecause his cellmate informed him that a note sent through inmates reflected Arzate was\n\nsupposed to be stabbed. Deputies found the note about Arzate being stabbed and moved\n\nArzate to the administrative segregation unit.\n\n       It appeared to Deputy Jarish that the note was sent by someone with the\n\nidentifying information of “Joker, WSV, Seventh Street.” Defendant is a member of the\n\nSeventh Street West Side Verdugo gang. Defendant‟s gang nickname is Little Joker.\n\nDeputy Jarish identified defendant as a possible sender of the note.\n\n       On April 6, 2011, a few weeks prior to defendant‟s trial, defendant and Arzate\n\nwere in a courthouse hallway. Defendant told Arzate he saw a video recording of\n\nArzate informing law enforcement about the victim‟s murder. Defendant told Arzate\n\n“to do right and don‟t forget that [defendant] knows where [Arzate‟s] sister lives.”\n\nArzate believed defendant was instructing him to not testify. Arzate decided to testify\n\ndespite the implicit threat because he was tired of fighting. Arzate admitted it was in his\n\nbest interests to state that the version of the events he testified to on the stand was the\n\ntruth. Arzate had a teardrop tattoo on his face, which could refer to murdering a person;\n\nhowever, Arzate got the tattoo in 2004 in honor of his Mother‟s death.\n\n       D.     RINCON‟S TESTIMONY\n\n       Rincon testified at defendant‟s trial. Rincon stated Arzate and Villafana came\n\nover to defendant‟s house on the night of the shooting—April 23. Rincon fell asleep\n\naround 11:00 p.m., while defendant, Arzate, and Villafana were still at the house.\n\nHowever, when Rincon spoke to Mahoney, she told the detective that defendant, Arzate,\n\n\n                                             13\n\fand Villafana left the house around 9:30 p.m. and they were gone for two to three\n\nhours—returning around midnight or 12:30 a.m.\n\n       At trial, Rincon testified that the day after the shooting, when deputies arrived at\n\nthe house, they asked Rincon to look in the yard for the gun. A deputy pointed Rincon\n\nto the vent along the house‟s floorboard and asked her to check it for a weapon. The\n\ndeputy instructed Rincon to push through the screen mesh, and she complied. Mahoney\n\ntestified that no one pointed Rincon to the vent, she walked directly to the vent of her\n\nown volition.\n\n       E.       DNA EVIDENCE\n\n       A San Bernardino County criminalist conducted DNA tests on (1) a fired bullet,\n\n(2) a glove, (3) a second glove, (4) the rough portion of a revolver grip, (5) the smooth\n\nportion of a revolver grip, and (6) the trigger of a revolver. The criminalist had DNA\n\nsamples from the victim, defendant, Villafana, and Arzate. DNA from the fired bullet\n\nmatched the victim; the bullet was recovered from the victim‟s body. The first glove\n\ncontained DNA from four different people—three men and one woman. Defendant was\n\n“included as being a possible source of a major component in that mixture.” The\n\nsecond glove contained DNA from two people—a major donor and a trace donor. The\n\nDNA test revealed defendant was “a possible source of the major component in the\n\nmixture.”\n\n       DNA from the rough portion of the revolver grip revealed a mixture of four\n\npeople‟s DNA. Defendant was determined to be “a possible major contributor to [the]\n\nmixture.” The victim, Arzate, and Villafana were excluded as being major contributors.\n\n\n                                            14\n\fDNA from the smooth portion of the revolver grip reflected two people‟s DNA, and one\n\nof the profiles was consistent with defendant‟s DNA profile. Villafana and Arzate were\n\nconsidered to be possible minor contributors to the DNA mixture. Defendant was\n\nidentified as being a possible major contributor to the three-person DNA mixture found\n\non the revolver‟s trigger. The victim and Villafana were excluded as being possible\n\ncontributors; Arzate was identified as a possible minor contributor.\n\n       F.     FIREARM EVIDENCE\n\n       A fired bullet found in the street near the victim‟s apartment complex also\n\nmatched the gun located under defendant‟s house. No fingerprints were found on the\n\nrevolver located under defendant‟s house. The gloves Arzate gave to the detectives\n\ntested positive for gunshot residue.\n\n       G.     BUS RIDE\n\n       On January 15, 2010, Deputy Godoy was assisting with transporting defendant\n\nand other inmates, by bus, from the courthouse to the jail. Godoy was a passenger on\n\nthe bus. Defendant was seated behind Godoy, to Godoy‟s left, approximately three feet\n\naway. During the drive, defendant was speaking to a female inmate, Maribel Lopez,\n\nwho was approximately two feet away from defendant. Defendant introduced himself\n\nto Maribel as “Joker.” The two began discussing their cases. Maribel was Arzate‟s\n\ngirlfriend. Godoy heard defendant say to Maribel, “I‟m the shooter.”\n\n       H.     DEFENDANT‟S TESTIMONY\n\n       Defendant testified at trial. Defendant explained that when he was speaking to\n\nMaribel on the bus, he said to her, “the authori[ti]es were saying that I was the shooter.”\n\n\n                                            15\n\fDefendant did not tell Maribel he was, in fact, the shooter; rather, he was describing the\n\nState‟s allegations against him.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n       A.     AIDING AND ABETTING INSTRUCTION\n\n              1.     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Prior to trial, defendant moved to have the prosecutor disclose the theory of guilt\n\nhe planned to argue at trial concerning the murder charge. During a hearing on the\n\nmotion, the prosecutor said, “People will announce and state that it‟s the theory of\n\nwillful, deliberate, and premeditated murder.” Defense counsel asked, “We‟re not\n\nproceeding on aiding and abetting or any other theory other than he‟s the perpetrator[?]”\n\nThe prosecutor said, “That‟s correct.”\n\n       On the record, the trial court stated it planned to discuss jury instructions with the\n\ntrial attorneys. Defendant waived his presence, and then “proceedings were held off the\n\nrecord.” The following day, the trial court said, “Now, we have discussed jury\n\ninstructions at length.” The trial court remarked that the discussion took place “[o]ff the\n\nrecord.” The trial court then asked defense counsel to discuss three specific instructions\n\nto which counsel had objected.\n\n       The first instruction concerned defendant‟s testimony. The second instruction\n\nrelated to defendant fleeing after the crime was committed or after being accused of the\n\ncrime. The third instruction appears to concern the instruction regarding the People‟s\n\nduty to disclose evidence and their failure to disclose a particular exhibit within the\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\flegal timeframe. After discussing the three instructions, the following exchange took\n\nplace:\n\n         “The Court: [Defense counsel], is there an instruction that you think I should not\n\ngive that I‟ve indicated that I‟m going to give?”\n\n         “[Defense counsel]: No.\n\n         “The Court: Is there an instruction that I‟m giving that you object to, other than\n\nwhat‟s been instructed[3]?\n\n         “[Defense counsel]: No.\n\n         “The Court: [Prosecutor], is there an instruction that he‟s requested that I‟ve\n\nrefused?\n\n         “[Prosecutor]: No, your Honor.\n\n         “The Court: Is there an instruction that I have indicated that I will not give\n\nadditionally? Excuse me. That you had requested that I refused?\n\n         “[Defense counsel]: No, it was shot down.\n\n         “The Court: Is there an instruction that you think I should not be giving, that I\n\nam giving?\n\n         “[Prosecutor]: No, your Honor.\n\n         “The Court: All right. Then, are you ready to argue?\n\n         “[Prosecutor]: Yes.\n\n         “The Court: Bring the jury in.”\n\n\n\n         3   We infer the word “instructed” should be replaced with the word “discussed.”\n\n                                              17\n\f       During closing argument, the prosecutor argued defendant was the shooter who\n\nkilled the victim—the direct perpetrator of the victim‟s murder. Defense counsel\n\nargued the prosecutor did not prove beyond “anything” beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWhen instructing the jury, the trial court gave an instruction on aiding and abetting.\n\n(CALCRIM No. 401.) The trial court informed the jury it could find defendant guilty of\n\nmurder on a theory of aiding and abetting. No objections were raised when the trial\n\ncourt read the aiding and abetting instruction. The jury found defendant guilty of first\n\ndegree murder (§ 187, subd. (a)), but it found not true the allegations that defendant\n\n(1) personally used a firearm during the murder (§ 12022.5, subd. (a)), and\n\n(2) personally discharged a firearm causing the victim‟s death (§ 12022.53, subd. (d)). 4\n\n\n\n\n       4  While it is unclear why the jury returned untrue findings for the two\nenhancements, one possibility is that the jury did not believe defendant was the direct\nperpetrator of the victim‟s death; a second possibility is that the jury feared the resulting\nprison sentence was too great—during Arzate‟s testimony, the prison sentence for the\nenhancements was discussed. During Arzate‟s testimony, the following exchange took\nplace:\n       “[Prosecutor]: So if you there‟s [sic] a first degree murder and a firearm, you\ncould get an additional 25 to life if you turned out to be the shooter and they proved it;\nright?\n       “[Arzate]: Right.\n       “[Prosecutor]: So you could be looking at, just off that, 50 to life. You‟re not\ngetting that; are you?\n       “[Arzate]: Yeah.\n       “[Prosecutor]: You are getting that?\n       “[Arzate]: No, I‟m not getting that.\n       “[Prosecutor]: And you admitted a gang allegation here. First degree murder,\nfirearm, and a gang allegation is 75 to life; isn‟t it?\n       “[Arzate]: Yeah.”\n\n                                             18\n\f              2.      ANALYSIS\n\n       Defendant asserts the trial court‟s act of instructing the jury on the law of aiding\n\nand abetting violated his right to due process because (1) the prosecutor did not pursue a\n\ntheory of guilt based on aiding and abetting, and (2) he was denied effective assistance\n\nof counsel. We disagree.\n\n       We begin with the assertion that the trial court erred by instructing the jury on a\n\ntheory of guilt not presented by the prosecutor. The People assert defendant forfeited\n\nthis argument by not objecting to the aiding and abetting instruction at the trial court.\n\n“Generally, a party forfeits any challenge to a jury instruction that was correct in law\n\nand responsive to the evidence if the party fails to object in the trial court. [Citations.]\n\nThe rule of forfeiture does not apply, however, if the instruction was an incorrect\n\nstatement of the law [citation], or if the instructional error affected the defendant‟s\n\nsubstantial rights. [Citations.] „“Ascertaining whether [the] claimed instructional error\n\naffected the substantial rights of the defendant necessarily requires an examination of\n\nthe merits of the claim—at least to the extent of ascertaining whether the asserted error\n\nwould result in prejudice if error it was.” [Citation.]‟ [Citation.]” (People v. Franco\n\n(2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 713, 719.) As we will discuss, the instruction did not affect\n\ndefendant‟s substantial rights. Therefore, defendant forfeited the claim of error on\n\nappeal.\n\n       We review the alleged instructional-due process error de novo. (People v. Burch\n\n(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 862, 870 (Burch).) “„[A] court is not precluded from giving\n\nany instruction for which there is evidentiary support. The fact that a party did not\n\n\n                                             19\n\fpursue a particular theory does not preclude the trial judge from giving an instruction on\n\nthat theory where it deems such an instruction to be appropriate.‟ [Citation.]” (People\n\nv. Ardoin (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 102, 128.)\n\n       In the instant case there was evidence of three people participating in the victim‟s\n\nmurder, e.g. the three dirt marks on the fence railing and Arzate‟s testimony. Arzate\n\ntestified that defendant was the shooter; however, it was never exactly clear why\n\ndefendant would want to shoot the victim—the only explanation was some prior\n\nunknown problem(s) between the two.\n\n       The primary evidence proving defendant was the shooter, as opposed to\n\nVillafana or Arzate being the shooter, was Arzate‟s testimony. Since Arzate is\n\ndefendant‟s codefendant, Arzate‟s testimony against defendant required corroboration.\n\n(§ 1111.) The trial court could reasonably conclude that there was not a great deal of\n\ndirect evidence corroborating the theory that defendant was the shooter; there was the\n\ngun at defendant‟s house and the overheard statement on the bus ride, but the vent\n\nwhere the gun was found was accessible from outside the house and defendant said only\n\na portion of his statement was overheard. Thus, the trial court could reasonably\n\nconclude that the jury would find defendant was a participant in the murder, but not the\n\nshooter, because Arzate‟s testimony about defendant being the shooter was corroborated\n\nby some evidence, but not overwhelming evidence, and it is unclear exactly why\n\ndefendant would have killed the victim, as opposed to Villafana or Arzate. In other\n\nwords, the evidence supports a conclusion that defendant was a participant in the crime,\n\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fbut not the direct perpetrator. As a result, the trial court properly instructed the jury\n\nwith the aiding and abetting instruction.\n\n       Moreover, defendant was not convicted of a separate crime of aiding and\n\nabetting. Rather, defendant was convicted only of murder. (See People v. Prettyman\n\n(1996) 14 Cal.4th 248, 259-260 [describing liability for aiding and abetting].) Thus, the\n\naiding and abetting instruction did not place defendant in the position of having to\n\ndefend against a previously uncharged crime, rather, aiding and abetting is a theory of\n\nthe crime of which defendant had been arguing against all along. (See People v. Ardoin,\n\nsupra, 196 Cal.App.4th at pp. 125-126 [discussing there not being a due process\n\nviolation because felony murder is not a separate offense from premeditated murder].)\n\nIn sum, we are not persuaded defendant‟s due process rights were violated by the trial\n\ncourt‟s act of instructing the jury on the law of aiding and abetting.\n\n       Next, we examine defendant‟s ineffective assistance of counsel contention.\n\nDefendant asserts the trial court denied him effective assistance of counsel by\n\ninstructing the jury on a theory that defense counsel did not have an opportunity to\n\ndefend against, i.e. aiding and abetting. Defendant contends his trial counsel made\n\ntactical decisions with the mindset that the only relevant theory was that defendant was\n\nthe direct perpetrator of the victim‟s death, and therefore, the trial court‟s act of\n\npresenting an aiding and abetting option to the jury denied defendant effective\n\nassistance of counsel.\n\n       Defendant‟s trial counsel argued defendant was not present during the shooting\n\nat all, and that the third person involved in the murder could have been Villafana‟s\n\n\n                                              21\n\fbrother. Defendant‟s counsel pursued the theory that defendant was not in any way\n\nconnected to the victim‟s murder because the prosecution failed to prove “anything”\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant has not explained how he would have presented\n\na different defense if he had received more explicit notice of the aiding and abetting\n\ntheory prior to trial. Thus, it is unclear how the trial court denied defendant‟s counsel\n\nthe opportunity to defend against the aiding and abetting theory as asserted by\n\ndefendant. It is also unclear how defendant suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged\n\ndenial of effective counsel. (See People v. Mesa (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1000, 1008\n\n[prejudice is a requirement of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim].)\n\n       In sum, since defendant has not demonstrated a due process violation or a denial\n\nof effective assistance of counsel, we conclude defendant forfeited his instructional\n\ncontention because he has not demonstrated that the instructional issue affected his\n\nsubstantial rights. Defendant did not object to the trial court‟s aiding and abetting\n\ninstruction, nor did he request to reopen his case. Defendant‟s failure to bring this\n\nalleged problem to the trial court‟s attention forecloses his ability to effectively raise the\n\nissue on appeal.\n\n       B.     INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER\n\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on the lesser\n\nincluded offense of involuntary manslaughter. (§ 192, subd. (b).) We disagree.\n\n       As set forth ante, we review alleged instructional errors de novo. (Burch, supra,\n\n148 Cal.App.4th at p. 870.) “Involuntary manslaughter is a lesser offense of murder,\n\ndistinguished by its mens rea. [Citation.] The mens rea for murder is specific intent to\n\n\n                                             22\n\fkill or conscious disregard for life. [Citation.] Absent these states of mind, the\n\ndefendant may incur homicide culpability for involuntary manslaughter. [Citations.]\n\nThrough statutory definition and judicial development, there are three types of acts that\n\ncan underlie commission of involuntary manslaughter: a misdemeanor, a lawful act, or\n\na non[-]inherently dangerous felony. [Citation.] . . . [F]or all three types of predicate\n\nacts the required mens rea is criminal negligence.” (People v. Butler (2010) 187\n\nCal.App.4th 998, 1006.)\n\n       Defendant asserts the trial court should have instructed the jury on the lesser\n\nincluded offense of manslaughter because the evidence reflects the possibility that\n\ndefendant went to the victim‟s apartment complex only to assault the victim, but either\n\nArzate or Villafana “suddenly and without warning escalated the assault into shooting”\n\nthe victim.\n\n       For the sake of judicial efficiency we will accept as true defendant‟s premise that\n\nthe trial court should have instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of\n\ninvoluntary manslaughter. (See People v. Breverman (1998) 19 Cal.4th 142, 154 [trial\n\ncourt has sua sponte duty to instruct “on lesser included offenses when the evidence\n\nraises a question as to whether all of the elements of the charged offense were\n\npresent.”].) Accepting this premise as true, we move to a discussion of prejudice.\n\n       The failure to instruct a jury on a lesser included offense is not reversible error\n\n“unless an examination of the entire record establishes a reasonable probability that the\n\nerror affected the outcome. [Citations.]” (People v. Breverman, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p.\n\n165.) The jury was instructed on first degree murder and second degree murder. The\n\n\n                                             23\n\fjury found defendant guilty of first degree murder. Specifically, the jury found (1) the\n\nmurder was premeditated, or (2) the murder was committed by lying in wait. The jury\n\nrejected the theory of second degree murder. Lying in wait and/or willful, deliberate,\n\nand premeditated murder are inconsistent with the mens rea of criminal negligence\n\nrequired for involuntary manslaughter. Given that the jury found defendant acted with\n\nthe specific intent to kill, and rejected the lesser option of second degree murder, we\n\nconclude the record does not establish a reasonable probability that the alleged\n\ninvoluntary manslaughter error affected the outcome of defendant‟s trial.\n\n       C.     SECOND DEGREE MURDER\n\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on the\n\nelements of second degree murder. We disagree.\n\n       We review instructional errors de novo. (Burch, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n870.) “Murder may be of the first or second degree. While both require malice\n\naforethought, first degree murder requires willful, deliberate premeditation” or lying in\n\nwait. (In re C.R. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1387, 1393; § 189.)\n\n       The trial court gave the jury the following instructions: “Homicide is the killing\n\nof one human being by another. Murder is a type of homicide. The defendant is\n\ncharged with murder.” (CALCRIM No. 500.) “The defendant is charged in Count 1\n\nwith Murder in violation of Penal Code section 187. To prove that the defendant is\n\nguilty of this crime, the People must prove that: [¶] 1. The defendant committed an act\n\nthat caused the death of another person; [¶] AND [¶] 2. When the defendant acted, he\n\nhad a state of mind call malice aforethought.” (CALCRIM No. 520, italics added.) The\n\n\n                                            24\n\ftrial court went on to explain the difference between express and implied malice. After\n\ngiving this information to the jury, the trial court stated that if the jury found defendant\n\nguilty of murder, then it would need to determine the degree of the offense.\n\n(CALCRIM No. 520.)\n\n       As the court continued, it explained the requirements for first degree murder.\n\nThe court explained the prosecutor was relying on theories of (1) willful, deliberate, and\n\npremeditated murder, and (2) lying in wait. (CALCRIM No. 521.) The court explained\n\nthe legal requirements for both theories. The court then said, “The People have the\n\nburden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was first degree murder\n\nrather than a lesser crime. If the People have not met this burden, you must find the\n\ndefendant not guilty of first degree murder.” (CALCRIM No. 521, italics added.)\n\n       The trial court continued instructing the jury, explaining how the jury should\n\napproach the Count 1 verdict forms. The trial court explained the jury had “verdict\n\nforms for guilty of first degree murder, guilty of second degree murder, and not guilty.”\n\nThe trial court explained, “You may consider these different kinds of homicide in\n\nwhatever order you wish, but I can accept a verdict of guilty of a lesser crime only if all\n\nof you have found the defendant not guilty of the greater crime.” The court then went\n\nstep-by-step through the process, explaining that if the jury found the State proved first\n\ndegree murder, then it should sign the first degree verdict form and leave the others\n\nalone. The court then explained that if the jury found defendant not guilty of first\n\ndegree murder, but guilty of second degree murder, then it should complete the second\n\ndegree murder form and so on. (CALCRIM No. 641.)\n\n\n                                             25\n\f       The jury instructions, when read together, indicate the trial court instructed the\n\njury on the elements of second degree murder by explaining the elements of a homicide.\n\nThe trial court then explained the extra elements that need to be proven for a finding of\n\nfirst degree murder. Thus, the jury instructions in this case are not deficient as they\n\nrelate to second degree murder. The trial court explained the requirements for the\n\noffense and the difference between the two degrees. In sum, the trial court did not err.\n\n       Defendant asserts the trial court erred because it did not explicitly “tell the jury\n\nthat if it found [defendant] committed murder, but did not commit premeditated murder\n\nor murder while lying in wait, it should return a verdict of second degree murder.”\n\nDefendant seems to be arguing with the way the instruction was phrased because the\n\ntrial court did give this information to the jury, but did not use the exact wording\n\nsuggested by defendant.\n\n       The trial court told the jury the elements for second degree murder and the added\n\nelements for first degree murder. The trial court also told the jury: “The People have\n\nthe burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was first degree murder\n\nrather than a lesser crime. If the People have not met this burden, you must find the\n\ndefendant not guilty of first degree murder.” (CALCRIM No. 521, italics added.) The\n\ntrial court also instructed the jury that if it found defendant not guilty of first degree\n\nmurder then it should move on to the second degree murder verdict form. In the plain\n\nlanguage of the instruction, the trial court informed the jury that if the jury found\n\ndefendant not guilty of first degree murder then it should consider the lesser offense of\n\nsecond degree murder. Accordingly, we find defendant‟s argument to be unpersuasive.\n\n\n                                              26\n\f       Defendant asserts his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to “request\n\ninstructions which would [have] allow[ed] the jury to convict [him] of second degree\n\nmurder.” We find defendant‟s argument to be unavailing because, as set forth ante, the\n\njury instructions did give the jury the option of convicting defendant of second degree\n\nmurder. Thus, defendant‟s trial counsel was effective in this regard.\n\n       D.     ACCOMPLICE TESTIMONY\n\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by admitting Arzate‟s testimony because\n\nArzate‟s agreement with the State placed him “under a strong compulsion to testify in\n\naccord with a version of events which the prosecution believed was true.” We disagree.\n\n       The People assert defendant forfeited this contention for appeal by failing to\n\nobject to Arzate‟s testimony on the basis he raises here. The failure to preserve an\n\nevidentiary issue by raising it below forfeits the issue for appeal. (People v. Boyer\n\n(2006) 38 Cal.4th 412, 454.) There is nothing indicating defendant objected to Arzate‟s\n\ntestimony on the basis of his testimony being improperly coerced. Accordingly, we\n\nagree with the People that the issue has been forfeited. Nevertheless, for the sake of\n\nperhaps preventing a future ineffective assistance of trial counsel argument, we will\n\naddress the merits of defendant‟s contention.\n\n       “„“[A] defendant is denied a fair trial if the prosecution‟s case depends\n\nsubstantially on accomplice testimony and the accomplice witness is placed, either by\n\nthe prosecution or by the court, under a strong compulsion to testify in a particular\n\nfashion.” . . . Thus, when the accomplice is granted immunity subject to the condition\n\nthat his testimony substantially conform to an earlier statement given to police . . . or\n\n\n                                             27\n\fthat his testimony result in defendant‟s conviction . . . the accomplice‟s testimony is\n\n“tainted beyond redemption” and its admission denies defendant a fair trial. On the\n\nother hand, although there is a certain degree of compulsion inherent in any plea\n\nagreement or grant of immunity, it is clear that an agreement requiring only that the\n\nwitness testify fully and truthfully is valid.‟” (People v. Sully (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1195,\n\n1216-1217, italics omitted.) We review the trial court‟s evidentiary ruling for an abuse\n\nof discretion. (People v. Brown (2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 536.)\n\n       Arzate testified at defendant‟s trial. Arzate was wearing an orange jumpsuit and\n\nwas in the custody of San Bernardino County due to murder charges related to the\n\nvictim, thus indicating Arzate was defendant‟s accomplice. (See § 1111 [defining an\n\naccomplice].) Arzate entered into an agreement with the prosecutor. The agreement\n\ncontemplated Arzate‟s truthful testimony against defendant in exchange for entering a\n\nplea to manslaughter (§ 192) and a gang enhancement (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)). Arzate\n\nwould receive a prison sentence of 16 years, which could maybe be served outside of\n\nCalifornia. Arzate‟s plea deal was not solidified prior to his testimony. Thus, if\n\nArzate‟s testimony were not truthful, the prosecutor could renege on the deal.\n\n       Arzate‟s agreement with the prosecution was for his truthful testimony. Arzate‟s\n\ndeal did not require him to testify to any particular version of the events other than the\n\ntruthful version. So, hypothetically, if the truthful version of the events were that\n\nVillafana killed the victim, then Arzate‟s testimony should have reflected those facts.\n\nArzate was not bound to testify that defendant was the shooter, unless that was the truth.\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\fAs a result, Arzate was not under any compulsion to testify in an invalid manner. Thus,\n\nwe conclude the trial court did not err by permitting Arzate to testify.\n\n       Defendant asserts the trial court erred because Arzate gave five different versions\n\nof the events surrounding the victim‟s death, and then testified to the version that best\n\nserved Arzate‟s interests—implicating defendant as the shooter to obtain a plea\n\nagreement with the State. As noted ante, there “is a certain degree of compulsion\n\ninherent in any plea agreement or grant of immunity, [but] it is clear that an agreement\n\nrequiring only that the witness testify fully and truthfully is valid.‟” (People v. Sully,\n\nsupra, 53 Cal.3d at pp. 1216-1217, italics omitted) While we agree Arzate‟s agreement\n\nmay have involved a certain degree of compulsion, there is nothing indicating that he\n\nwas required to testify to any particular one version of the five stories he gave the\n\npolice, in fact, he could have testified to a sixth version of the events so long as it was\n\nthe truth. Thus, we are not persuaded that Arzate‟s agreement with the State was\n\ncoercive to the point of forcing him to testify untruthfully.\n\n       E.     CORROBORATION INSTRUCTION\n\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that\n\naccomplice testimony requires corroboration to the extent the testimony concerns an\n\nelement of a charged offense. We disagree.\n\n       The People assert defendant forfeited this issue for appeal by failing to request a\n\nmodification to CALCRIM No. 335 at the trial court. We agree with the People. A\n\ndetailed procedural history of the parties‟ jury instruction discussion with the trial court\n\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\fis set forth ante, so we do not repeat it here in its entirety. The portion of the discussion\n\nrelevant to this issue of forfeiture went as follows:\n\n       “The Court: Is there an instruction that I‟m giving that you object to, other than\n\nwhat‟s been instructed[5]?\n\n       “[Defense counsel]: No.\n\n       “The Court: [Prosecutor], is there an instruction that he‟s requested that I‟ve\n\nrefused?\n\n       “[Prosecutor]: No, your Honor.”\n\n       It appears from the record that defendant did not object to the trial court‟s version\n\nof CALCRIM No. 335. Thus, defendant has not preserved this issue for appeal and\n\nshould not be raising it here for the first time. Nevertheless, to perhaps detract from the\n\nneed for a future ineffective assistance of trial counsel argument, we will address the\n\nmerits of defendant‟s contention.\n\n       As explained ante, we review alleged instructional errors de novo. (Burch,\n\nsupra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 870.) The trial court gave the jury the following\n\ninstruction, in relevant part: “If the crime of Murder was committed, then Elias Azarte\n\n[sic] was an accomplice to that crime. [¶] You may not convict the defendant of Murder\n\nbased on the statement or testimony of an accomplice alone. You may use the\n\nstatement or testimony of an accomplice to convict the defendant only if: [¶] 1. The\n\naccomplice‟s statement or testimony is supported by other evidence that you believe; [¶]\n\n2. That supporting evidence is independent of the accomplice‟s statement or testimony;\n\n       5   We infer the word “instructed” should be replaced with the word “discussed.”\n\n                                             30\n\f[¶] AND [¶] 3. That supporting evidence tends to connect the defendant to the\n\ncommission of the crime.” (CALCRIM No. 335, italics added.)\n\n       The trial court went on to explain the definition of “supporting evidence.” In that\n\nexplanation, the trial court said, “[I]t is not enough if the supporting evidence merely\n\nshows that a crime was committed or the circumstances of its commission. The\n\nsupporting evidence must tend to connect the defendant to the commission of the crime.\n\n[¶] Any statement or testimony of an accomplice that tends to incriminate the\n\ndefendant should be viewed with caution.” (CALCRIM No. 335, italics added.)\n\n       As set forth ante, the trial court instructed the jury any accomplice testimony that\n\nwould lead to defendant‟s conviction, or incriminate defendant, needed corroboration.\n\nA defendant is convicted or incriminated by committing the elements of a crime. Thus,\n\nthe jury received the information that any accomplice testimony needed to be\n\ncorroborated if it implicated defendant as committing an element of a charged offense.\n\n       Defendant‟s argument focuses on the portion of the trial court‟s instruction\n\nreflecting, “3. That supporting evidence tends to connect the defendant to the\n\ncommission of the crime.” Defendant argues this language is incorrect because it does\n\nnot explain that the corroborating evidence had to be about an element of the offense,\n\nbut that the corroborating evidence only needed to have the tendency of connecting\n\ndefendant to the offense. We are perplexed by defendant‟s argument. What evidence\n\ntending to connect defendant to the commission of an offense would not concern an\n\nelement of an offense? In other words, what else could the trial court have been\n\ndiscussing but evidence reflecting defendant committed the elements of murder?\n\n\n                                            31\n\f       Defendant seems to assert the trial court‟s instruction should have been written in\n\na plainer or simpler manner. As set forth ante, if defendant wanted to modify the\n\nlanguage of the instruction then he should have requested the trial court do so—not wait\n\nuntil he reached the appellate court. We will not fault the trial court for delivering\n\nrequired information with perhaps more eloquent terms than defendant would prefer. In\n\nsum, the trial court did not err.\n\n       F.     UNANIMITY INSTRUCTION\n\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on unanimity.\n\nDefendant asserts a unanimity instruction should have been given concerning first\n\ndegree murder because the prosecutor proceeded on the theories of (1) lying in wait, and\n\n(2) willful, deliberate, premeditated murder. We disagree.\n\n       Our Supreme Court has rejected defendant‟s precise contention. In People v.\n\nRussell (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1228, our Supreme Court wrote: “„This court . . . views lying\n\nin wait “as the functional equivalent of proof of premeditation, deliberation and intent to\n\nkill.”‟ [Citation.] Because lying in wait and deliberate and premeditated theories of\n\nmurder are simply different means of committing the same crime, juror unanimity as to\n\nthe theory underlying its guilty verdict is not required.” (Id. at p. 1257.)\n\n       Since we are bound to follow our high court‟s rulings, we must reject defendant‟s\n\nargument that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on unanimity.

(Pen.\n\nCode, § 187, subd. (a).)1, 2 The trial court sentenced defendant to prison for an\n\nindeterminate term of 25 years to life. Defendant raises six issues on appeal. First,\n\ndefendant contends the trial court erred by, in the last moments of trial, deciding to\n\ninstruct the jury on an aiding and abetting theory of guilt that was never discussed or\n\nlitigated. Second, defendant asserts the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on\n\nthe lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. (§ 192, subd. (b).) Third,\n\ndefendant contends the trial court erred by not instructing the jury that it could convict\n\ndefendant of second degree murder if it found defendant did not premeditate the murder\n\nor lie in wait for the victim. Fourth, defendant asserts the trial court erred by admitting\n\ntestimony from a witness who had an agreement with the State. Fifth, defendant\n\ncontends the trial court erred by not instructing the jury that an accomplice‟s testimony\n\nmust be corroborated. Sixth, defendant asserts the trial court erred by not instructing the\n\njury on unanimity. We affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n       1   All subsequent statutory references will be to the Penal Code unless indicated.\n\n       2 The jury found not true the allegations that defendant (1) personally used a\nfirearm during the commission of the felony (§ 12022.5. subd. (a)), and (2) personally\nand intentionally discharged a firearm proximately causing the victim‟s death\n(§ 12022.53, subd. (d)). We note the minute order reflects the jury found a gang\nallegation to not be true (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)); however, this appears to be a\ntypographical error, as it does not appear any gang allegations were set forth in the\ninformation.\n\n                                             2\n\f                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       A.     THE CRIME\n\n       In April 2006, the victim, an adult male, lived in an apartment in Adelanto. Also\n\nliving in the apartment were (1) the victim‟s fiancée (Mother), (2) Mother‟s mother\n\n(Grandmother), and (3) Mother‟s children. During April 2006, Mother was hospitalized\n\nfor kidney issues. The victim moved into the apartment with Mother‟s family in\n\napproximately February 2006, and helped Grandmother take care of Mother‟s children.\n\nMother had a 13-year-old son named Adrian, a 15-year-old son named Fernando\n\n(hereinafter “the brothers”), and two other sons.\n\n       On April 22, 2006, at approximately 8:00 or 9:00 p.m., Adrian, Fernando, and\n\ntheir cousin were walking through the apartment complex on their way to the brothers‟\n\napartment. The boys were stopped by a group of six or seven individuals, who were\n\nhaving a party in a carport. Three of the individuals, who were young men, approached\n\nthe boys and asked where the boys were from. The boys stopped to hear what the\n\nyoung men were saying. The young men spoke to Fernando about the Los Angeles\n\nDodgers hat he was wearing. The young men asked if Fernando was in a gang and why\n\nhe was wearing the Los Angeles hat. Fernando recognized one of the young men as a\n\nresident of the apartment complex, Jose Villafana (Villafana). The boys did not\n\nrespond, and continued walking.\n\n       One of the young men, Elias Arzate (Arzate), shoved Fernando. Fernando told\n\nArzate he had no reason to fight Arzate, and Fernando kept walking to his apartment.\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\fDefendant often spent time with Villafana in the apartment complex. Fernando could\n\nnot recall if defendant was at the carport party, but defendant‟s friends were at the party.\n\n       When the boys arrived at the brothers‟ apartment, Adrian called Mother at the\n\nhospital to tell her about the confrontation with the individuals in the carport. Mother\n\ntold Adrian to stay inside the apartment. The victim was at the hospital visiting Mother\n\nwhen Adrian called. That night, when the victim arrived home from visiting Mother,\n\nAdrian told the victim about the confrontation. The brothers stayed inside the apartment\n\nfor the rest of the night.\n\n       At approximately noon the following day, April 23, the brothers were on their\n\npatio, which is surrounded by a wooden fence. Fernando saw Arzate walk by, toward\n\nVillafana‟s apartment. Villafana‟s apartment was approximately 10 to 15 feet away\n\nfrom the brothers‟ apartment. Arzate “mad dogged” (confrontationally stared at) the\n\nbrothers, as Arzate walked through the apartment complex. Adrian told the victim\n\nabout Arzate staring at him and Fernando. The victim saw “the look” on the brothers‟\n\nfaces. The victim went to Villafana‟s apartment.\n\n       The victim knocked on Villafana‟s apartment door, and spoke to Villafana and\n\nArzate. The victim told Villafana and Arzate that if they “have any kinds of problems\n\nwith [his] kids to go and talk to [the victim] about it.” Villafana and Arzate looked\n\ndown as though they were ashamed of their actions—an argument did not take place.\n\nThe victim returned to his apartment.\n\n       The victim was a habitual smoker, who stepped outside the apartment\n\napproximately every 30 minutes to smoke a cigarette. At approximately 10:30 p.m., the\n\n\n                                             4\n\fvictim went outside the apartment to smoke a cigarette. Gunshots were fired. Fernando\n\ncalled 911 and locked the front door. Grandmother yelled that she thought the victim\n\nwas shot. Adrian woke up, opened the front door, and saw the victim lying in front of\n\nthe door, face down in a “puddle of blood . . . with his eyes open.” Fernando saw the\n\nvictim and called 911 again to report the victim was shot.\n\n       The brothers turned the victim face-up, and Adrian spoke to the victim, but the\n\nvictim did not respond. Approximately 30 seconds after being turned over, the victim\n\nstopped breathing. The victim typically carried a flip-type handyman‟s knife in his\n\npocket. Adrian did not see the knife on the ground next to the victim; Adrian believed\n\nthe knife was still in the victim‟s pocket.\n\n       B.     THE INVESTIGATION\n\n       Sheriff‟s Detective Myler investigated the victim‟s death. When Myler arrived at\n\nthe apartment complex on April 23 he saw the victim was deceased. Myler noticed two\n\ngunshot wounds on the front of the victim‟s left shoulder, one of which was near the\n\nvictim‟s neck, and a third gunshot wound on the victim‟s right lower back area. The\n\nvictim died as a result of the gunshot wounds.\n\n       Myler spoke to people in the neighborhood. As a result of those interviews,\n\nMyler identified Villafana and Villafana‟s friends as possible suspects. Also as a result\n\nof the interviews, Myler checked the fence line on the northern end of the apartment\n\ncomplex to determine if anyone had jumped over it. Myler found dirt on top of the\n\nchain-link fence railing in three different locations, not far from one another.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f        Sheriff‟s Detective Mahoney also investigated the victim‟s death. Mahoney\n\nspoke to Grandmother and the brothers. After speaking with the family, Mahoney\n\nidentified Villafana and Arzate as suspects. Villafana was not at his apartment when\n\nMahoney went to speak to him that night. Mahoney began investigating a third possible\n\nsuspect after speaking to more people; the third suspect was defendant.\n\n        The detectives decided to take a break and reconvene later in the day. As four of\n\nthe law enforcement officers were driving their separate cars in a caravan, Mahoney saw\n\nthree people walking through a field. The people matched the descriptions of the three\n\nsuspects: (1) defendant, with a clean-shaven head, Hispanic, and with a somewhat large\n\nstature; and (2) Villafana and Arzate who were Hispanic, “smaller,” and “skinny.”\n\nMahoney used his telephone to call Sheriff‟s Detective Shenton to assist him in\n\ncontacting the people in the field.\n\n        Mahoney and Shenton stopped their cars in the field, near the three suspects, who\n\nwere Villafana, Arzate, and defendant. Shenton asked Villafana and Arzate to come\n\nover to his vehicle. Mahoney asked defendant to come to his vehicle. The three men\n\n“nonchalantly approached” the detectives. Defendant allowed Mahoney to pat him\n\ndown. Mahoney did not find any weapons. Defendant told Mahoney his name, which\n\nmatched the first name of the suspect Mahoney was looking for—Mahoney did not have\n\nthe suspect‟s last name. Mahoney had never known a Hispanic person by the name of\n\nKirk, so he was surprised when defendant said his name was the same as the suspect‟s\n\nname.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f       Mahoney stepped away from defendant, in order to call Sergeant Bolt (Bolt).\n\nMahoney told Bolt, “[W]e found them. You need to turn around.” Bolt had continued\n\non in the caravan when Mahoney and Shenton stopped in the field. Defendant\n\noverheard Mahoney and began running away. Mahoney chased after defendant.\n\nDefendant ran to his residence. Defendant‟s girlfriend (Rincon), was standing outside\n\nthe residence, behind a chain-link fence. Rincon yelled at defendant to stop running.\n\n       Defendant ran into his yard, circled the house twice, gave Rincon a kiss, and then\n\njumped over a block wall into an apartment complex. Mahoney instructed defendant to\n\nstop running, and followed defendant into the apartment complex. Defendant jumped\n\nover a fence into another apartment complex. Mahoney jumped over the fence as well.\n\nMahoney saw defendant enter an apartment. Mahoney called Bolt, who used his radio\n\nto direct other deputies.\n\n       Uniformed deputies with shotguns entered the apartment. Defendant was\n\nhandcuffed and escorted out of the apartment. Two other people were inside the\n\napartment; the people inside the apartment were related to Rincon. Defendant was\n\ntransported to the Adelanto substation to be interviewed. Mahoney went back to\n\ndefendant‟s residence to interview Rincon. Rincon agreed to assist Mahoney with\n\nlooking for a weapon. Rincon walked into the backyard, and Mahoney followed her.\n\nRincon stopped next to one of the ventilation grates on the exterior of the house (the\n\ngrates are located every 10 feet along the floor area of the house). Rincon pushed her\n\nhand through the screen mesh, and the mesh fell back. Rincon pointed Mahoney toward\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\fthe area where the mesh fell away. A deputy reached through and pulled out a .357\n\nMagnum revolver wrapped in a shirt.\n\n       Mahoney spoke to Rincon‟s brother (Jose). Jose told Mahoney that late at night\n\non April 22, he saw Villafana holding a revolver. Villafana was in a car stopped along\n\nthe road, and a another person, whom Jose did not recognize, was also in the car. Jose\n\ndescribed the gun, and the description was consistent with the .357 Magnum found at\n\ndefendant‟s residence. Jose assumed Villafana and the second person “were up to no\n\ngood.” Mahoney returned to the station to interview defendant, Arzate, and Villafana.\n\n       C.     ARZATE‟S TESTIMONY\n\n       Arzate testified at defendant‟s trial. Arzate was wearing an orange jumpsuit and\n\nwas in the custody of San Bernardino County due to murder charges related to the\n\nvictim. Arzate entered into an agreement with the prosecutor. The agreement\n\ncontemplated Arzate‟s truthful testimony against defendant in exchange for entering a\n\nplea to manslaughter (§ 192) and a gang enhancement (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)). Arzate\n\nwould receive a prison sentence of 16 years, which could be served outside of\n\nCalifornia. The trial court stated it did not believe anyone had the authority to promise\n\na prison sentence could be served outside of California. Arzate‟s plea deal was not\n\nsolidified prior to his testimony. Thus, if Arzate‟s testimony were not truthful, the\n\nprosecutor could renege on the deal. Arzate expressed concern that his testimony\n\nagainst defendant would lead to him being stabbed in prison and/or Arzate‟s sister being\n\nharmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f      Arzate met defendant in February 2006 through Villafana. Arzate supplied\n\nmethamphetamines to defendant, for defendant to sell. Arzate visited defendant‟s house\n\non a weekly basis, but they were not friends. Arzate met Villafana in school in 1998 or\n\n1999, and they were friends. Arzate is a member of the 41st Street gang in South\n\nCentral Los Angeles. Defendant is a member of the Seventh Street West Side Verdugo\n\ngang. Defendant‟s gang nickname is Little Joker. Villafana was possibly a member of\n\nthe Westside Wilmington gang.\n\n      Arzate denied shooting a gun in April 2006. On April 23, 2006, Arzate and\n\nVillafana went to Palm Springs during the day. The two returned to Villafana‟s\n\napartment at approximately 7:00 p.m. When Arzate went outside to get something out\n\nof the car, a teenager was “mad dogging” Arzate. Arzate stared back at the teenager and\n\nthen reentered Villafana‟s apartment. A few minutes later, the victim knocked on\n\nVillafana‟s apartment door.\n\n      Arzate thought the victim was “kind of aggressive” and noticed the knife on the\n\nvictim‟s belt. The victim asked Arzate if he had a problem with the victim‟s “nephew.”\n\nBefore Arzate could answer, the victim asked Villafana if he had a problem with the\n\nvictim‟s nephew. Arzate felt disrespected by the victim, because the victim did not give\n\nArzate an opportunity to answer, before questioning Villafana. Arzate asked the victim\n\nif the victim‟s nephew had a problem with them. The victim said, “no.” Arzate\n\nresponded, “[T]here‟s your answer,” and then closed the door. Villafana asked what\n\nhad happened earlier to cause the victim to come to Villafana‟s apartment. Arzate said\n\na teenager outside the victim‟s apartment was looking at Arzate, so he “looked at him\n\n\n                                           9\n\fback.” Villafana and Arzate stayed at Villafana‟s apartment for one or two hours, and\n\nthen went to defendant‟s house to give him drugs.\n\n       Upon arriving at defendant‟s house, Arzate, Villafana, and defendant smoked\n\nmethamphetamines. The three men discussed the incident with the teenager staring at\n\nArzate and the victim coming to Villafana‟s house. Arzate told defendant he felt as\n\nthough the victim was disrespecting him. Defendant “[p]ulled out a gun” from his\n\nwaistband. Defendant said, “I‟ll smoke that fool.” Arzate said the victim “didn‟t\n\ndeserve that.” Arzate said he would rather fight the victim, because the victim asked\n\nVillafana a question without giving Arzate an opportunity to respond to the previous\n\nquestion. Villafana told the two men to “leave it alone,” but also agreed to “jump” the\n\nvictim. Defendant said he wanted to kill the victim. Arzate later learned defendant had\n\nprior problems with the victim.\n\n       Arzate became upset because defendant wanted to kill the victim, so Arzate\n\nwalked outside. After 30 minutes, Arzate went back inside the house. Defendant asked\n\nArzate what he wanted to do, and Arzate said he wanted to fight the victim. Defendant\n\nsaid he would put the gun away. The men continued to smoke, and then went to the\n\nvictim‟s apartment complex, in order for Arzate to fight the victim.\n\n       Villafana and defendant knew the victim went outside every night at 10:00 p.m.\n\nto smoke a cigarette. The three men planned to wait for the victim to exit his apartment\n\nto smoke a cigarette. Arzate and Villafana would wait across the street while defendant\n\nwould wait in the carport area. Defendant would initiate the fight by rushing at the\n\nvictim. Defendant had a black bandana around his neck and gloves on his hands.\n\n\n                                           10\n\fDefendant asked Arzate to unscrew three light bulbs in the carport area, and Arzate\n\ncomplied. Villafana stayed hidden across the street.\n\n       Arzate began walking back toward Villafana, across the street. While walking,\n\nArzate saw the victim and pointed defendant to where the victim was standing. Arzate\n\nsaw defendant lift his shirt and pull “something” out. Arzate heard the victim say,\n\n“[N]o,” and then heard a gunshot. After the first gunshot, Arzate ducked down and\n\nthought, “[W]hat the fuck[?]” Arzate stood up, saw the gun in defendant‟s hand, saw\n\nthe flare from the gun being shot, heard three more gunshots, and told Villafana they\n\nshould run. The two men began running and jumped over a fence. Defendant caught up\n\nto the men, and ran with them.\n\n       The men ran to Arzate‟s apartment. Defendant removed the bandana, gloves,\n\nand his shirt. Arzate put the clothes in a bag and gave the bag to a woman at his\n\napartment. The woman took the bag. The three men then drove around Adelanto “for a\n\nlittle bit.” Arzate asked defendant why he killed the victim. Defendant responded that\n\n“he wanted [the victim] dead.” Villafana was quiet. Arzate told defendant that if\n\nArzate were arrested, then defendant should “stand up for what he did.” Arzate was\n\nupset with defendant. Defendant told Arzate, “[D]on‟t trip: That [I] got it.” Defendant\n\ntold Villafana he should have seen the face the victim made prior to dying. Villafana\n\nremained quiet. Arzate continued pushing defendant to take responsibility for the\n\noffense if the men were arrested. Defendant pulled out the gun and said, “[I] gots (sic)\n\nit,” and not to worry.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f       The three men returned to defendant‟s house. Defendant gave Villafana the gun\n\nand told Villafana to empty the gun and clean it. Defendant went upstairs with Rincon.\n\nVillafana and Arzate spent the night at defendant‟s house. Villafana returned the gun to\n\ndefendant. The following day (April 24) at approximately 11:00 a.m., the three men\n\nwalked to the store to purchase diapers for defendant and Rincon‟s newborn son, and\n\nwere arrested during the walk.\n\n       Mahoney interviewed Arzate. Arzate was not truthful with the detective during\n\nthe interview. Arzate told Mahoney he had argued with gang members from La Puente\n\nearlier in the day and was at the apartment complex to retaliate against the gang\n\nmembers. Arzate explained he was at the complex during the shooting, but only\n\nbecause he was looking for the gang members. Arzate then changed his story and\n\nclaimed he was not present at the complex during the shooting, but defendant told him\n\nabout the killing.\n\n       Eventually, Arzate changed his story and admitted being at the apartment\n\ncomplex to confront the victim. Arzate told Mahoney about the victim coming to\n\nVillafana‟s apartment door to talk to them. Arzate identified defendant as the person\n\nwho killed the victim. Arzate told Mahoney about the bag of clothing and instructed the\n\nwoman at the apartment to give the bag to the detective.\n\n       Arzate was taken into custody in 2006, and remained in custody through\n\ndefendant‟s trial in May 2011. After defendant spoke to Mahoney about what happened\n\non the night of the shooting, Arzate suffered fights in jail. Over the years, Arzate has\n\ncontinued to suffer fights in jail due to making a statement to Mahoney. In March 2011,\n\n\n                                            12\n\fArzate made the decision to testify against defendant. Arzate made the decision\n\nbecause his cellmate informed him that a note sent through inmates reflected Arzate was\n\nsupposed to be stabbed. Deputies found the note about Arzate being stabbed and moved\n\nArzate to the administrative segregation unit.\n\n       It appeared to Deputy Jarish that the note was sent by someone with the\n\nidentifying information of “Joker, WSV, Seventh Street.” Defendant is a member of the\n\nSeventh Street West Side Verdugo gang. Defendant‟s gang nickname is Little Joker.\n\nDeputy Jarish identified defendant as a possible sender of the note.\n\n       On April 6, 2011, a few weeks prior to defendant‟s trial, defendant and Arzate\n\nwere in a courthouse hallway. Defendant told Arzate he saw a video recording of\n\nArzate informing law enforcement about the victim‟s murder. Defendant told Arzate\n\n“to do right and don‟t forget that [defendant] knows where [Arzate‟s] sister lives.”\n\nArzate believed defendant was instructing him to not testify. Arzate decided to testify\n\ndespite the implicit threat because he was tired of fighting. Arzate admitted it was in his\n\nbest interests to state that the version of the events he testified to on the stand was the\n\ntruth. Arzate had a teardrop tattoo on his face, which could refer to murdering a person;\n\nhowever, Arzate got the tattoo in 2004 in honor of his Mother‟s death.\n\n       D.     RINCON‟S TESTIMONY\n\n       Rincon testified at defendant‟s trial. Rincon stated Arzate and Villafana came\n\nover to defendant‟s house on the night of the shooting—April 23. Rincon fell asleep\n\naround 11:00 p.m., while defendant, Arzate, and Villafana were still at the house.\n\nHowever, when Rincon spoke to Mahoney, she told the detective that defendant, Arzate,\n\n\n                                             13\n\fand Villafana left the house around 9:30 p.m. and they were gone for two to three\n\nhours—returning around midnight or 12:30 a.m.\n\n       At trial, Rincon testified that the day after the shooting, when deputies arrived at\n\nthe house, they asked Rincon to look in the yard for the gun. A deputy pointed Rincon\n\nto the vent along the house‟s floorboard and asked her to check it for a weapon. The\n\ndeputy instructed Rincon to push through the screen mesh, and she complied. Mahoney\n\ntestified that no one pointed Rincon to the vent, she walked directly to the vent of her\n\nown volition.\n\n       E.       DNA EVIDENCE\n\n       A San Bernardino County criminalist conducted DNA tests on (1) a fired bullet,\n\n(2) a glove, (3) a second glove, (4) the rough portion of a revolver grip, (5) the smooth\n\nportion of a revolver grip, and (6) the trigger of a revolver. The criminalist had DNA\n\nsamples from the victim, defendant, Villafana, and Arzate. DNA from the fired bullet\n\nmatched the victim; the bullet was recovered from the victim‟s body. The first glove\n\ncontained DNA from four different people—three men and one woman. Defendant was\n\n“included as being a possible source of a major component in that mixture.” The\n\nsecond glove contained DNA from two people—a major donor and a trace donor. The\n\nDNA test revealed defendant was “a possible source of the major component in the\n\nmixture.”\n\n       DNA from the rough portion of the revolver grip revealed a mixture of four\n\npeople‟s DNA. Defendant was determined to be “a possible major contributor to [the]\n\nmixture.” The victim, Arzate, and Villafana were excluded as being major contributors.\n\n\n                                            14\n\fDNA from the smooth portion of the revolver grip reflected two people‟s DNA, and one\n\nof the profiles was consistent with defendant‟s DNA profile. Villafana and Arzate were\n\nconsidered to be possible minor contributors to the DNA mixture. Defendant was\n\nidentified as being a possible major contributor to the three-person DNA mixture found\n\non the revolver‟s trigger. The victim and Villafana were excluded as being possible\n\ncontributors; Arzate was identified as a possible minor contributor.\n\n       F.     FIREARM EVIDENCE\n\n       A fired bullet found in the street near the victim‟s apartment complex also\n\nmatched the gun located under defendant‟s house. No fingerprints were found on the\n\nrevolver located under defendant‟s house. The gloves Arzate gave to the detectives\n\ntested positive for gunshot residue.\n\n       G.     BUS RIDE\n\n       On January 15, 2010, Deputy Godoy was assisting with transporting defendant\n\nand other inmates, by bus, from the courthouse to the jail. Godoy was a passenger on\n\nthe bus. Defendant was seated behind Godoy, to Godoy‟s left, approximately three feet\n\naway. During the drive, defendant was speaking to a female inmate, Maribel Lopez,\n\nwho was approximately two feet away from defendant. Defendant introduced himself\n\nto Maribel as “Joker.” The two began discussing their cases. Maribel was Arzate‟s\n\ngirlfriend. Godoy heard defendant say to Maribel, “I‟m the shooter.”\n\n       H.     DEFENDANT‟S TESTIMONY\n\n       Defendant testified at trial. Defendant explained that when he was speaking to\n\nMaribel on the bus, he said to her, “the authori[ti]es were saying that I was the shooter.”\n\n\n                                            15\n\fDefendant did not tell Maribel he was, in fact, the shooter; rather, he was describing the\n\nState‟s allegations against him.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n       A.     AIDING AND ABETTING INSTRUCTION\n\n              1.     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Prior to trial, defendant moved to have the prosecutor disclose the theory of guilt\n\nhe planned to argue at trial concerning the murder charge. During a hearing on the\n\nmotion, the prosecutor said, “People will announce and state that it‟s the theory of\n\nwillful, deliberate, and premeditated murder.” Defense counsel asked, “We‟re not\n\nproceeding on aiding and abetting or any other theory other than he‟s the perpetrator[?]”\n\nThe prosecutor said, “That‟s correct.”\n\n       On the record, the trial court stated it planned to discuss jury instructions with the\n\ntrial attorneys. Defendant waived his presence, and then “proceedings were held off the\n\nrecord.” The following day, the trial court said, “Now, we have discussed jury\n\ninstructions at length.” The trial court remarked that the discussion took place “[o]ff the\n\nrecord.” The trial court then asked defense counsel to discuss three specific instructions\n\nto which counsel had objected.\n\n       The first instruction concerned defendant‟s testimony. The second instruction\n\nrelated to defendant fleeing after the crime was committed or after being accused of the\n\ncrime. The third instruction appears to concern the instruction regarding the People‟s\n\nduty to disclose evidence and their failure to disclose a particular exhibit within the\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\flegal timeframe. After discussing the three instructions, the following exchange took\n\nplace:\n\n         “The Court: [Defense counsel], is there an instruction that you think I should not\n\ngive that I‟ve indicated that I‟m going to give?”\n\n         “[Defense counsel]: No.\n\n         “The Court: Is there an instruction that I‟m giving that you object to, other than\n\nwhat‟s been instructed[3]?\n\n         “[Defense counsel]: No.\n\n         “The Court: [Prosecutor], is there an instruction that he‟s requested that I‟ve\n\nrefused?\n\n         “[Prosecutor]: No, your Honor.\n\n         “The Court: Is there an instruction that I have indicated that I will not give\n\nadditionally? Excuse me. That you had requested that I refused?\n\n         “[Defense counsel]: No, it was shot down.\n\n         “The Court: Is there an instruction that you think I should not be giving, that I\n\nam giving?\n\n         “[Prosecutor]: No, your Honor.\n\n         “The Court: All right. Then, are you ready to argue?\n\n         “[Prosecutor]: Yes.\n\n         “The Court: Bring the jury in.”\n\n\n\n         3   We infer the word “instructed” should be replaced with the word “discussed.”\n\n                                              17\n\f       During closing argument, the prosecutor argued defendant was the shooter who\n\nkilled the victim—the direct perpetrator of the victim‟s murder. Defense counsel\n\nargued the prosecutor did not prove beyond “anything” beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWhen instructing the jury, the trial court gave an instruction on aiding and abetting.\n\n(CALCRIM No. 401.) The trial court informed the jury it could find defendant guilty of\n\nmurder on a theory of aiding and abetting. No objections were raised when the trial\n\ncourt read the aiding and abetting instruction. The jury found defendant guilty of first\n\ndegree murder (§ 187, subd. (a)), but it found not true the allegations that defendant\n\n(1) personally used a firearm during the murder (§ 12022.5, subd. (a)), and\n\n(2) personally discharged a firearm causing the victim‟s death (§ 12022.53, subd. (d)). 4\n\n\n\n\n       4  While it is unclear why the jury returned untrue findings for the two\nenhancements, one possibility is that the jury did not believe defendant was the direct\nperpetrator of the victim‟s death; a second possibility is that the jury feared the resulting\nprison sentence was too great—during Arzate‟s testimony, the prison sentence for the\nenhancements was discussed. During Arzate‟s testimony, the following exchange took\nplace:\n       “[Prosecutor]: So if you there‟s [sic] a first degree murder and a firearm, you\ncould get an additional 25 to life if you turned out to be the shooter and they proved it;\nright?\n       “[Arzate]: Right.\n       “[Prosecutor]: So you could be looking at, just off that, 50 to life. You‟re not\ngetting that; are you?\n       “[Arzate]: Yeah.\n       “[Prosecutor]: You are getting that?\n       “[Arzate]: No, I‟m not getting that.\n       “[Prosecutor]: And you admitted a gang allegation here. First degree murder,\nfirearm, and a gang allegation is 75 to life; isn‟t it?\n       “[Arzate]: Yeah.”\n\n                                             18\n\f              2.      ANALYSIS\n\n       Defendant asserts the trial court‟s act of instructing the jury on the law of aiding\n\nand abetting violated his right to due process because (1) the prosecutor did not pursue a\n\ntheory of guilt based on aiding and abetting, and (2) he was denied effective assistance\n\nof counsel. We disagree.\n\n       We begin with the assertion that the trial court erred by instructing the jury on a\n\ntheory of guilt not presented by the prosecutor. The People assert defendant forfeited\n\nthis argument by not objecting to the aiding and abetting instruction at the trial court.\n\n“Generally, a party forfeits any challenge to a jury instruction that was correct in law\n\nand responsive to the evidence if the party fails to object in the trial court. [Citations.]\n\nThe rule of forfeiture does not apply, however, if the instruction was an incorrect\n\nstatement of the law [citation], or if the instructional error affected the defendant‟s\n\nsubstantial rights. [Citations.] „“Ascertaining whether [the] claimed instructional error\n\naffected the substantial rights of the defendant necessarily requires an examination of\n\nthe merits of the claim—at least to the extent of ascertaining whether the asserted error\n\nwould result in prejudice if error it was.” [Citation.]‟ [Citation.]” (People v. Franco\n\n(2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255929\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255929/people-v-franco/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719.) As we will discuss, the instruction did not affect\n\ndefendant‟s substantial rights. Therefore, defendant forfeited the claim of error on\n\nappeal.\n\n       We review the alleged instructional-due process error de novo. (People v. Burch\n\n(2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2271705\"><a href=\"/opinion/2271705/people-v-burch/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 870 (Burch).) “„[A] court is not precluded from giving\n\nany instruction for which there is evidentiary support. The fact that a party did not\n\n\n                                             19\n\fpursue a particular theory does not preclude the trial judge from giving an instruction on\n\nthat theory where it deems such an instruction to be appropriate.‟ [Citation.]” (People\n\nv. Ardoin (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128.)\n\n       In the instant case there was evidence of three people participating in the victim‟s\n\nmurder, e.g. the three dirt marks on the fence railing and Arzate‟s testimony. Arzate\n\ntestified that defendant was the shooter; however, it was never exactly clear why\n\ndefendant would want to shoot the victim—the only explanation was some prior\n\nunknown problem(s) between the two.\n\n       The primary evidence proving defendant was the shooter, as opposed to\n\nVillafana or Arzate being the shooter, was Arzate‟s testimony. Since Arzate is\n\ndefendant‟s codefendant, Arzate‟s testimony against defendant required corroboration.\n\n(§ 1111.) The trial court could reasonably conclude that there was not a great deal of\n\ndirect evidence corroborating the theory that defendant was the shooter; there was the\n\ngun at defendant‟s house and the overheard statement on the bus ride, but the vent\n\nwhere the gun was found was accessible from outside the house and defendant said only\n\na portion of his statement was overheard. Thus, the trial court could reasonably\n\nconclude that the jury would find defendant was a participant in the murder, but not the\n\nshooter, because Arzate‟s testimony about defendant being the shooter was corroborated\n\nby some evidence, but not overwhelming evidence, and it is unclear exactly why\n\ndefendant would have killed the victim, as opposed to Villafana or Arzate. In other\n\nwords, the evidence supports a conclusion that defendant was a participant in the crime,\n\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fbut not the direct perpetrator. As a result, the trial court properly instructed the jury\n\nwith the aiding and abetting instruction.\n\n       Moreover, defendant was not convicted of a separate crime of aiding and\n\nabetting. Rather, defendant was convicted only of murder. (See People v. Prettyman\n\n(1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160471\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160471/people-v-prettyman/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 259-260 [describing liability for aiding and abetting].) Thus, the\n\naiding and abetting instruction did not place defendant in the position of having to\n\ndefend against a previously uncharged crime, rather, aiding and abetting is a theory of\n\nthe crime of which defendant had been arguing against all along. (See People v. Ardoin,\n\nsupra, 196 Cal.App.4th at pp. 125-126 [discussing there not being a due process\n\nviolation because felony murder is not a separate offense from premeditated murder].)\n\nIn sum, we are not persuaded defendant‟s due process rights were violated by the trial\n\ncourt‟s act of instructing the jury on the law of aiding and abetting.\n\n       Next, we examine defendant‟s ineffective assistance of counsel contention.\n\nDefendant asserts the trial court denied him effective assistance of counsel by\n\ninstructing the jury on a theory that defense counsel did not have an opportunity to\n\ndefend against, i.e. aiding and abetting. Defendant contends his trial counsel made\n\ntactical decisions with the mindset that the only relevant theory was that defendant was\n\nthe direct perpetrator of the victim‟s death, and therefore, the trial court‟s act of\n\npresenting an aiding and abetting option to the jury denied defendant effective\n\nassistance of counsel.\n\n       Defendant‟s trial counsel argued defendant was not present during the shooting\n\nat all, and that the third person involved in the murder could have been Villafana‟s\n\n\n                                              21\n\fbrother. Defendant‟s counsel pursued the theory that defendant was not in any way\n\nconnected to the victim‟s murder because the prosecution failed to prove “anything”\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant has not explained how he would have presented\n\na different defense if he had received more explicit notice of the aiding and abetting\n\ntheory prior to trial. Thus, it is unclear how the trial court denied defendant‟s counsel\n\nthe opportunity to defend against the aiding and abetting theory as asserted by\n\ndefendant. It is also unclear how defendant suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged\n\ndenial of effective counsel. (See People v. Mesa (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2290489\"><a href=\"/opinion/2290489/people-v-mesa/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1008\n\n[prejudice is a requirement of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim].)\n\n       In sum, since defendant has not demonstrated a due process violation or a denial\n\nof effective assistance of counsel, we conclude defendant forfeited his instructional\n\ncontention because he has not demonstrated that the instructional issue affected his\n\nsubstantial rights. Defendant did not object to the trial court‟s aiding and abetting\n\ninstruction, nor did he request to reopen his case. Defendant‟s failure to bring this\n\nalleged problem to the trial court‟s attention forecloses his ability to effectively raise the\n\nissue on appeal.\n\n       B.     INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER\n\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on the lesser\n\nincluded offense of involuntary manslaughter. (§ 192, subd. (b).) We disagree.\n\n       As set forth ante, we review alleged instructional errors de novo. (Burch, supra,\n\n148 Cal.App.4th at p. 870.) “Involuntary manslaughter is a lesser offense of murder,\n\ndistinguished by its mens rea. [Citation.] The mens rea for murder is specific intent to\n\n\n                                             22\n\fkill or conscious disregard for life. [Citation.] Absent these states of mind, the\n\ndefendant may incur homicide culpability for involuntary manslaughter. [Citations.]\n\nThrough statutory definition and judicial development, there are three types of acts that\n\ncan underlie commission of involuntary manslaughter: a misdemeanor, a lawful act, or\n\na non[-]inherently dangerous felony. [Citation.] . . . [F]or all three types of predicate\n\nacts the required mens rea is criminal negligence.” (People v. Butler (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2288353\"><a href=\"/opinion/2288353/people-v-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">998</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1006.)\n\n       Defendant asserts the trial court should have instructed the jury on the lesser\n\nincluded offense of manslaughter because the evidence reflects the possibility that\n\ndefendant went to the victim‟s apartment complex only to assault the victim, but either\n\nArzate or Villafana “suddenly and without warning escalated the assault into shooting”\n\nthe victim.\n\n       For the sake of judicial efficiency we will accept as true defendant‟s premise that\n\nthe trial court should have instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of\n\ninvoluntary manslaughter. (See People v. Breverman (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1198942\"><a href=\"/opinion/1198942/people-v-breverman/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154 [trial\n\ncourt has sua sponte duty to instruct “on lesser included offenses when the evidence\n\nraises a question as to whether all of the elements of the charged offense were\n\npresent.”].) Accepting this premise as true, we move to a discussion of prejudice.\n\n       The failure to instruct a jury on a lesser included offense is not reversible error\n\n“unless an examination of the entire record establishes a reasonable probability that the\n\nerror affected the outcome. [Citations.]” (People v. Breverman, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p.\n\n165.) The jury was instructed on first degree murder and second degree murder. The\n\n\n                                             23\n\fjury found defendant guilty of first degree murder. Specifically, the jury found (1) the\n\nmurder was premeditated, or (2) the murder was committed by lying in wait. The jury\n\nrejected the theory of second degree murder. Lying in wait and/or willful, deliberate,\n\nand premeditated murder are inconsistent with the mens rea of criminal negligence\n\nrequired for involuntary manslaughter. Given that the jury found defendant acted with\n\nthe specific intent to kill, and rejected the lesser option of second degree murder, we\n\nconclude the record does not establish a reasonable probability that the alleged\n\ninvoluntary manslaughter error affected the outcome of defendant‟s trial.\n\n       C.     SECOND DEGREE MURDER\n\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on the\n\nelements of second degree murder. We disagree.\n\n       We review instructional errors de novo. (Burch, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n870.) “Murder may be of the first or second degree. While both require malice\n\naforethought, first degree murder requires willful, deliberate premeditation” or lying in\n\nwait. (In re C.R. (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2285857\"><a href=\"/opinion/2285857/in-re-cr/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1387</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1393; § 189.)\n\n       The trial court gave the jury the following instructions: “Homicide is the killing\n\nof one human being by another. Murder is a type of homicide. The defendant is\n\ncharged with murder.” (CALCRIM No. 500.) “The defendant is charged in Count 1\n\nwith Murder in violation of Penal Code section 187. To prove that the defendant is\n\nguilty of this crime, the People must prove that: [¶] 1. The defendant committed an act\n\nthat caused the death of another person; [¶] AND [¶] 2. When the defendant acted, he\n\nhad a state of mind call malice aforethought.” (CALCRIM No. 520, italics added.) The\n\n\n                                            24\n\ftrial court went on to explain the difference between express and implied malice. After\n\ngiving this information to the jury, the trial court stated that if the jury found defendant\n\nguilty of murder, then it would need to determine the degree of the offense.\n\n(CALCRIM No. 520.)\n\n       As the court continued, it explained the requirements for first degree murder.\n\nThe court explained the prosecutor was relying on theories of (1) willful, deliberate, and\n\npremeditated murder, and (2) lying in wait. (CALCRIM No. 521.) The court explained\n\nthe legal requirements for both theories. The court then said, “The People have the\n\nburden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was first degree murder\n\nrather than a lesser crime. If the People have not met this burden, you must find the\n\ndefendant not guilty of first degree murder.” (CALCRIM No. 521, italics added.)\n\n       The trial court continued instructing the jury, explaining how the jury should\n\napproach the Count 1 verdict forms. The trial court explained the jury had “verdict\n\nforms for guilty of first degree murder, guilty of second degree murder, and not guilty.”\n\nThe trial court explained, “You may consider these different kinds of homicide in\n\nwhatever order you wish, but I can accept a verdict of guilty of a lesser crime only if all\n\nof you have found the defendant not guilty of the greater crime.” The court then went\n\nstep-by-step through the process, explaining that if the jury found the State proved first\n\ndegree murder, then it should sign the first degree verdict form and leave the others\n\nalone. The court then explained that if the jury found defendant not guilty of first\n\ndegree murder, but guilty of second degree murder, then it should complete the second\n\ndegree murder form and so on. (CALCRIM No. 641.)\n\n\n                                             25\n\f       The jury instructions, when read together, indicate the trial court instructed the\n\njury on the elements of second degree murder by explaining the elements of a homicide.\n\nThe trial court then explained the extra elements that need to be proven for a finding of\n\nfirst degree murder. Thus, the jury instructions in this case are not deficient as they\n\nrelate to second degree murder. The trial court explained the requirements for the\n\noffense and the difference between the two degrees. In sum, the trial court did not err.\n\n       Defendant asserts the trial court erred because it did not explicitly “tell the jury\n\nthat if it found [defendant] committed murder, but did not commit premeditated murder\n\nor murder while lying in wait, it should return a verdict of second degree murder.”\n\nDefendant seems to be arguing with the way the instruction was phrased because the\n\ntrial court did give this information to the jury, but did not use the exact wording\n\nsuggested by defendant.\n\n       The trial court told the jury the elements for second degree murder and the added\n\nelements for first degree murder. The trial court also told the jury: “The People have\n\nthe burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was first degree murder\n\nrather than a lesser crime. If the People have not met this burden, you must find the\n\ndefendant not guilty of first degree murder.” (CALCRIM No. 521, italics added.) The\n\ntrial court also instructed the jury that if it found defendant not guilty of first degree\n\nmurder then it should move on to the second degree murder verdict form. In the plain\n\nlanguage of the instruction, the trial court informed the jury that if the jury found\n\ndefendant not guilty of first degree murder then it should consider the lesser offense of\n\nsecond degree murder. Accordingly, we find defendant‟s argument to be unpersuasive.\n\n\n                                              26\n\f       Defendant asserts his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to “request\n\ninstructions which would [have] allow[ed] the jury to convict [him] of second degree\n\nmurder.” We find defendant‟s argument to be unavailing because, as set forth ante, the\n\njury instructions did give the jury the option of convicting defendant of second degree\n\nmurder. Thus, defendant‟s trial counsel was effective in this regard.\n\n       D.     ACCOMPLICE TESTIMONY\n\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by admitting Arzate‟s testimony because\n\nArzate‟s agreement with the State placed him “under a strong compulsion to testify in\n\naccord with a version of events which the prosecution believed was true.” We disagree.\n\n       The People assert defendant forfeited this contention for appeal by failing to\n\nobject to Arzate‟s testimony on the basis he raises here. The failure to preserve an\n\nevidentiary issue by raising it below forfeits the issue for appeal. (People v. Boyer\n\n(2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515839\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515839/people-v-boyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454.) There is nothing indicating defendant objected to Arzate‟s\n\ntestimony on the basis of his testimony being improperly coerced. Accordingly, we\n\nagree with the People that the issue has been forfeited. Nevertheless, for the sake of\n\nperhaps preventing a future ineffective assistance of trial counsel argument, we will\n\naddress the merits of defendant‟s contention.\n\n       “„“[A] defendant is denied a fair trial if the prosecution‟s case depends\n\nsubstantially on accomplice testimony and the accomplice witness is placed, either by\n\nthe prosecution or by the court, under a strong compulsion to testify in a particular\n\nfashion.” . . . Thus, when the accomplice is granted immunity subject to the condition\n\nthat his testimony substantially conform to an earlier statement given to police . . . or\n\n\n                                             27\n\fthat his testimony result in defendant‟s conviction . . . the accomplice‟s testimony is\n\n“tainted beyond redemption” and its admission denies defendant a fair trial. On the\n\nother hand, although there is a certain degree of compulsion inherent in any plea\n\nagreement or grant of immunity, it is clear that an agreement requiring only that the\n\nwitness testify fully and truthfully is valid.‟” (People v. Sully (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1216-1217, italics omitted.) We review the trial court‟s evidentiary ruling for an abuse\n\nof discretion. (People v. Brown (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585503\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585503/people-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 536.)\n\n       Arzate testified at defendant‟s trial. Arzate was wearing an orange jumpsuit and\n\nwas in the custody of San Bernardino County due to murder charges related to the\n\nvictim, thus indicating Arzate was defendant‟s accomplice. (See § 1111 [defining an\n\naccomplice].) Arzate entered into an agreement with the prosecutor. The agreement\n\ncontemplated Arzate‟s truthful testimony against defendant in exchange for entering a\n\nplea to manslaughter (§ 192) and a gang enhancement (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)). Arzate\n\nwould receive a prison sentence of 16 years, which could maybe be served outside of\n\nCalifornia. Arzate‟s plea deal was not solidified prior to his testimony. Thus, if\n\nArzate‟s testimony were not truthful, the prosecutor could renege on the deal.\n\n       Arzate‟s agreement with the prosecution was for his truthful testimony. Arzate‟s\n\ndeal did not require him to testify to any particular version of the events other than the\n\ntruthful version. So, hypothetically, if the truthful version of the events were that\n\nVillafana killed the victim, then Arzate‟s testimony should have reflected those facts.\n\nArzate was not bound to testify that defendant was the shooter, unless that was the truth.\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\fAs a result, Arzate was not under any compulsion to testify in an invalid manner. Thus,\n\nwe conclude the trial court did not err by permitting Arzate to testify.\n\n       Defendant asserts the trial court erred because Arzate gave five different versions\n\nof the events surrounding the victim‟s death, and then testified to the version that best\n\nserved Arzate‟s interests—implicating defendant as the shooter to obtain a plea\n\nagreement with the State. As noted ante, there “is a certain degree of compulsion\n\ninherent in any plea agreement or grant of immunity, [but] it is clear that an agreement\n\nrequiring only that the witness testify fully and truthfully is valid.‟” (People v. Sully,\n\nsupra, 53 Cal.3d at pp. 1216-1217, italics omitted) While we agree Arzate‟s agreement\n\nmay have involved a certain degree of compulsion, there is nothing indicating that he\n\nwas required to testify to any particular one version of the five stories he gave the\n\npolice, in fact, he could have testified to a sixth version of the events so long as it was\n\nthe truth. Thus, we are not persuaded that Arzate‟s agreement with the State was\n\ncoercive to the point of forcing him to testify untruthfully.\n\n       E.     CORROBORATION INSTRUCTION\n\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that\n\naccomplice testimony requires corroboration to the extent the testimony concerns an\n\nelement of a charged offense. We disagree.\n\n       The People assert defendant forfeited this issue for appeal by failing to request a\n\nmodification to CALCRIM No. 335 at the trial court. We agree with the People. A\n\ndetailed procedural history of the parties‟ jury instruction discussion with the trial court\n\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\fis set forth ante, so we do not repeat it here in its entirety. The portion of the discussion\n\nrelevant to this issue of forfeiture went as follows:\n\n       “The Court: Is there an instruction that I‟m giving that you object to, other than\n\nwhat‟s been instructed[5]?\n\n       “[Defense counsel]: No.\n\n       “The Court: [Prosecutor], is there an instruction that he‟s requested that I‟ve\n\nrefused?\n\n       “[Prosecutor]: No, your Honor.”\n\n       It appears from the record that defendant did not object to the trial court‟s version\n\nof CALCRIM No. 335. Thus, defendant has not preserved this issue for appeal and\n\nshould not be raising it here for the first time. Nevertheless, to perhaps detract from the\n\nneed for a future ineffective assistance of trial counsel argument, we will address the\n\nmerits of defendant‟s contention.\n\n       As explained ante, we review alleged instructional errors de novo. (Burch,\n\nsupra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 870.) The trial court gave the jury the following\n\ninstruction, in relevant part: “If the crime of Murder was committed, then Elias Azarte\n\n[sic] was an accomplice to that crime. [¶] You may not convict the defendant of Murder\n\nbased on the statement or testimony of an accomplice alone. You may use the\n\nstatement or testimony of an accomplice to convict the defendant only if: [¶] 1. The\n\naccomplice‟s statement or testimony is supported by other evidence that you believe; [¶]\n\n2. That supporting evidence is independent of the accomplice‟s statement or testimony;\n\n       5   We infer the word “instructed” should be replaced with the word “discussed.”\n\n                                             30\n\f[¶] AND [¶] 3. That supporting evidence tends to connect the defendant to the\n\ncommission of the crime.” (CALCRIM No. 335, italics added.)\n\n       The trial court went on to explain the definition of “supporting evidence.” In that\n\nexplanation, the trial court said, “[I]t is not enough if the supporting evidence merely\n\nshows that a crime was committed or the circumstances of its commission. The\n\nsupporting evidence must tend to connect the defendant to the commission of the crime.\n\n[¶] Any statement or testimony of an accomplice that tends to incriminate the\n\ndefendant should be viewed with caution.” (CALCRIM No. 335, italics added.)\n\n       As set forth ante, the trial court instructed the jury any accomplice testimony that\n\nwould lead to defendant‟s conviction, or incriminate defendant, needed corroboration.\n\nA defendant is convicted or incriminated by committing the elements of a crime. Thus,\n\nthe jury received the information that any accomplice testimony needed to be\n\ncorroborated if it implicated defendant as committing an element of a charged offense.\n\n       Defendant‟s argument focuses on the portion of the trial court‟s instruction\n\nreflecting, “3. That supporting evidence tends to connect the defendant to the\n\ncommission of the crime.” Defendant argues this language is incorrect because it does\n\nnot explain that the corroborating evidence had to be about an element of the offense,\n\nbut that the corroborating evidence only needed to have the tendency of connecting\n\ndefendant to the offense. We are perplexed by defendant‟s argument. What evidence\n\ntending to connect defendant to the commission of an offense would not concern an\n\nelement of an offense? In other words, what else could the trial court have been\n\ndiscussing but evidence reflecting defendant committed the elements of murder?\n\n\n                                            31\n\f       Defendant seems to assert the trial court‟s instruction should have been written in\n\na plainer or simpler manner. As set forth ante, if defendant wanted to modify the\n\nlanguage of the instruction then he should have requested the trial court do so—not wait\n\nuntil he reached the appellate court. We will not fault the trial court for delivering\n\nrequired information with perhaps more eloquent terms than defendant would prefer. In\n\nsum, the trial court did not err.\n\n       F.     UNANIMITY INSTRUCTION\n\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on unanimity.\n\nDefendant asserts a unanimity instruction should have been given concerning first\n\ndegree murder because the prosecutor proceeded on the theories of (1) lying in wait, and\n\n(2) willful, deliberate, premeditated murder. We disagree.\n\n       Our Supreme Court has rejected defendant‟s precise contention. In People v.\n\nRussell (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2629080\"><a href=\"/opinion/2629080/people-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, our Supreme Court wrote: “„This court . . . views lying\n\nin wait “as the functional equivalent of proof of premeditation, deliberation and intent to\n\nkill.”‟ [Citation.] Because lying in wait and deliberate and premeditated theories of\n\nmurder are simply different means of committing the same crime, juror unanimity as to\n\nthe theory underlying its guilty verdict is not required.” (Id. at p. 1257.)\n\n       Since we are bound to follow our high court‟s rulings, we must reject defendant‟s\n\nargument that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on unanimity.
