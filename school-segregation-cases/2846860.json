PROLER, Appellee\n\n\n                       On Appeal from the 234th District Court\n                               Harris County, Texas\n                         Trial Court Cause No. 2007-30944\n\n\n                       MAJORITY OPINION\n\n       The City of Houston appealed to a district court an independent hearing\nexaminer’s award in favor of Shayn A. Proler. Proler filed a counterclaim against the\nCity under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and the Texas Commission on\nHuman Rights Act (“TCHRA”). The trial court dismissed for want of jurisdiction the\nCity’s claims and rendered judgment in favor of Proler, awarding him injunctive relief\nand attorney’s fees.\n\n       On appeal, the City presents five issues: (1) the evidence is legally and factually\ninsufficient to support the jury’s finding that the City engaged in employment\n\fdiscrimination; (2) the trial court erred by refusing the City’s proffered jury instructions;\n(3) the trial court erred by awarding Proler attorney’s fees; (4) the trial court erred by\ngranting Proler injunctive relief; and (5) the trial court erred by dismissing for want of\njurisdiction the City’s petition. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n\n                                          I. BACKGROUND\n\n        In the early 1990s, Proler joined the Houston Fire Department (“HFD”). During\n2002, he was promoted to captain and worked at a fire-suppression station where he\nsupervised multiple firefighters.1 In 2004, Executive Assistant Chief Hector Trevino\nreceived a letter in which allegations were made that Proler was “scared to go into fires,”\nleaving his crew to suppress fires unsupervised. Chief Trevino transferred Proler to an\nHFD training academy. Proler had various administrative responsibilities at the academy\nbut was not involved in fire suppression. According to Proler, members of HFD consider\nthe transfer of a non-injured firefighter to the academy as a disciplinary action.\n\n        Proler remained stationed at the academy for more than a year. During this time,\nHFD denied Proler’s requests for transfer to a suppression unit.                     Eventually, Chief\nTrevino agreed to transfer Proler if Proler could find a senior captain who would allow\nProler to join his suppression unit and evaluate Proler for several months. Proler met\nwith District Chief John C. Seamans and Senior Captain Roosevelt Johnson to discuss\nProler’s joining suppression station 59.            Proler assured Chief Seamans and Captain\nJohnson that Proler’s reputation for fear of firefighting was unfounded. Captain Johnson\npermitted Proler to join station 59.\n\n        During Proler’s tenure at station 59, Captain Johnson completed three written\nevaluations regarding Proler. In each evaluation, Captain Johnson gave Proler an overall\nrating of “effective” or “strong.” However, during the same time, several unnamed\nfirefighters made “off the record” complaints to Chief Seamans, alleging Proler was\n\n        1\n         Generally, a suppression station is manned by multiple firefighters, an engineer, a captain and/or\nsenior captain, and possibly a chief. The purpose of a suppression unit is to respond to a variety of\nemergencies, including suppression of building fires.\n\n                                                    2\n\f“either afraid of firefighting or that his ‘head goes out on him’ when faced with severe\nfire conditions.” Chief Seamans did not take action based on these complaints but\ndecided to continue evaluating Proler’s performance.\n\n         On March 26, 2006, station 59 and other units responded to a building fire. At the\nscene of the fire, Captain Johnson gave Proler several orders, including an order to\nprotect an adjacent building. Proler failed to complete any of his assignments. Proler\nalso did not comply with Captain Johnson’s repeated orders to wear his uniform properly.\nAt one point, Captain Johnson found Proler standing in a smoke-filled room. Proler was\nextracted and received medical attention. Medics determined Proler’s blood pressure was\nlow. Johnson and others suggested that Proler seek treatment at a hospital, but Proler\nrefused. Eventually, Proler was ordered to seek treatment. Proler was diagnosed as\nhaving suffered an episode of global transient amnesia.\n\n         After the March 2006 fire, Captain Johnson sent a letter to Chief Seamans,\nexpressing concerns regarding Proler’s behavior during the incident. In turn, Chief\nSeamans sent a letter to Fire Chief Phil Boriskie and Chief Trevino elaborating on these\nconcerns. In light of these letters, Chief Trevino transferred Proler to the academy.\nThereafter, Proler requested a transfer to a fire suppression unit, which Chief Trevino\ndenied.\n\n         Proler challenged the transfer denial through the administrative grievance\nprocess.2 After his step II grievance was unsuccessful, Proler appealed to an independent\nhearing examiner.3 During May 2007, the hearing examiner signed an order, directing\nHFD to transfer Proler to a suppression station and pay him certain lost compensation.\nPursuant to the hearing examiner’s award, the City transferred Proler to a suppression\nunit and paid him lost compensation.\n\n\n\n         2\n             See Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 143.127–.134 (West 2008 & Supp. 2011).\n         3\n             See Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 143.057; 143.1016 (West 2008); 143.129(d) (West Supp.\n2008).\n\n                                                    3\n\f       The City appealed the hearing examiner’s award to a district court, asserting that\nthe court had jurisdiction under the Local Government Code and the Declaratory\nJudgments Act.4 In his counterclaim under the ADA and TCHRA, Proler alleged that the\nCity discriminated against him based on perceived disability. Proler filed a plea to the\njurisdiction, arguing that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the City’s appeal. The\ntrial court granted the plea and dismissed the City’s claims for want of jurisdiction.\n\n       Following trial on Proler’s claim, the jury found that the City discriminated\nagainst Proler based on perceived disability. However, the jury awarded no damages.\nThe trial court rendered judgment on the jury’s verdict but also awarded Proler injunctive\nrelief and attorney’s fees.\n\n                          II. LEGAL AND FACTUAL SUFFICIENCY\n\n       In its first issue, the City contends the trial court erred by denying the City’s\nmotion for directed verdict or motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because\nthe evidence is legally insufficient to support a finding that Proler was “disabled” as\ndefined under the TCHRA and ADA. Appellant also challenges factual sufficiency of the\nevidence.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n       We review a trial court’s ruling on a motion for directed verdict or a motion for\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict under a legal-sufficiency standard. City of Keller v.\nWilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 823–24 (Tex. 2005); Envtl. Procedures, Inc. v. Guidry, 282\nS.W.3d 602, 626 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, pet. denied).                      A legal-\nsufficiency point must be sustained when (1) there is a complete absence of evidence\nregarding a vital fact, (2) rules of law or evidence preclude according weight to the only\nevidence offered to prove a vital fact, (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no\nmore than a scintilla, or (4) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of the vital\n\n\n       4\n         See Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 143.057(j); 143.1016(j); Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann.\n§ 37.004 (West 2008).\n\n                                                4\n\ffact. Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 810. Under the legal-sufficiency standard, we must credit\nevidence that supports the judgment if reasonable jurors could and disregard contrary\nevidence unless reasonable jurors could not. Id. at 827. If the evidence falls within the\nzone of reasonable disagreement, we may not invade the fact-finding role of the jurors,\nwho alone determine the credibility of witnesses, weight to give their testimony, and\nwhether to accept or reject all or any part of that testimony. Id. at 822; Hartland v.\nProgressive Cnty. Mut. Ins. Co., 290 S.W.3d 318, 321–22 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\nDist.] 2009, no pet.). We must determine whether the evidence at trial would enable\nreasonable and fair-minded persons to find the facts at issue. Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827.\n\n       When reviewing a challenge to factual sufficiency of the evidence, we examine\nthe entire record, considering both the evidence in favor of, and contrary to, the\nchallenged finding. Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986) (per curiam). After\nconsidering and weighing all the evidence, we set aside the fact finding only if it is so\ncontrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.\nId. The trier of fact is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to\nbe given to their testimony.          Garza v. Slaughter, 331 S.W.3d 43, 45 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.). The amount of evidence necessary to affirm a\njudgment is far less than that necessary to reverse a judgment. GTE Mobilnet of S. Tex. v.\nPascouet, 61 S.W.3d 599, 616 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied).\n\nB. Analysis\n\n       In the jury charge, the trial court submitted the following question and instructions\nregarding the alleged unlawful employment practice, which mostly track the Texas\nPattern Jury Charge5:\n\n       Was disability (as defined below) a motivating factor (as defined below) in\n       the [City’s] decision to transfer [Proler] to the training academy of [HFD]\n       from March 28, 2006 until May 25, 2007?\n\n\n\n       5\n           See Texas Pattern Jury Charges PJC 107.6, 107.11 (2008).\n\n                                                    5\n\f              A “motivating factor” in an employment decision is a reason for\n        making the decision at the time it was made. There may be more than one\n        motivating factor for an employment decision.\n              “Disability” means being regarded as having a mental or physical\n        impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity.\n               The term “mental or physical impairment” means any physiological\n        disorder, condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting\n        one or more of the following body systems: neurological; musculoskeletal;\n        special sense organs; respiratory (including speech organs); cardiovascular;\n        reproductive; digestive; genitourinary; hemic; lymphatic; skin; and\n        endocrine; or any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental\n        retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and\n        specific learning disabilities.\n               “Major life activities” means functions such as caring for oneself,\n        performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing,\n        learning, thinking6 or working.\n                “Substantially limits” (as applied to “major life activities” other\n        than “working”) means that an individual is unable to perform a major life\n        activity that the average person in the general population can perform or\n        that an individual is significantly restricted as to the condition, manner, or\n        duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life\n        activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the\n        average person in the general population can perform that same major life\n        activity.\n                “Substantially limits” (as applied to the “major life activity” of\n        “working”) means that an individual is restricted in the ability to perform\n        either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as\n        compared to the average person having comparable training, skills, and\n        abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not\n        constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working\n               “Substantially limits” (as applied to the “major life activity” of\n        “performing manual tasks”) means that an individual is prevented or\n\n\n        6\n          At the time of trial, “thinking” was not specifically defined as a major life activity in the\nTCHRA or ADA. However, neither party objected to the inclusion of “thinking.” Thus, we review\nsufficiency of the evidence based on the charge actually submitted. See Osterberg v. Peca, 12 S.W.3d 31,\n55 (Tex. 2000). Regardless, courts have held that “thinking” is a major life activity. See Taylor v.\nPhoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 307 (3d Cir. 1999). Moreover, in the current TCHRA and ADA,\n“thinking” is defined as a major life activity. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 12102(2)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)(1)(i);\nTex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.002(11-a) (West Supp. 2011).\n\n                                                    6\n\f        severally restricted from doing activities that are of central importance to\n        most people’s daily lives.\n               “Being regarded as having such an impairment” means an\n        individual: (a) has a physical or mental impairment that does not\n        substantially limit a major life activity but is perceived by the employer as\n        having such a limitation; (b) has a physical or mental impairment that\n        substantially limits a major life activity only as a result of the attitudes of\n        others toward the impairment; or (c) does not have an impairment at all,\n        but is regarded by the employer as having such a substantially limiting\n        impairment.7\n\n        The City contends the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support a\nfinding the City regarded Proler as having an impairment that substantially limited a\nmajor life activity. We disagree. The following evidence supports a finding that the City\nregarded Proler as significantly restricted regarding the conditions under which he could\n“think” as compared to the conditions under which the average person is able to “think.”\n\n    Proler provided the following testimony regarding his behavior during the March\n    2006 fire. While en route to the fire, Proler attempted to grab his equipment but his\n    hand “didn’t necessarily cooperate. I’d miss it. I’d miss by several inches. . . . And I\n    knew something was clearly wrong at that time.” After arriving at the scene and\n    receiving orders, “it was obvious to [Proler] something was unusual, because [he] was\n    having difficulty walking and doing stuff that [he] would normally consider routine.”\n    “Eventually somebody . . . grabbed [Proler] by [his] left arm and physically took\n    [him] to the house next door, and sat [him] on a 5-gallon bucket that was turned\n    upside down. And from . . . sitting on that 5-gallon bucket to talking here today, . . .\n    everything has been normal.”8\n\n    Chief Trevino made the decision to transfer Proler to the academy in March 2006 and\n    deny his requests for a transfer back to a suppression unit. According to Chief\n    Trevino, he made these decisions based on letters written by Chief Seamans and\n\n\n        7\n            We emphasize those portions of the instructions pertinent to our sufficiency analysis.\n        8\n          During cross-examination, the City impeached Proler’s trial testimony regarding his recollection\nof the March 2006 fire. The City presented Proler’s deposition testimony that he was in and out of\nconsciousness during the incident. In response to the impeachment, Proler admitted he is unable to testify\nregarding what transpired during “several seconds” at the fire scene; however, Proler also testified that he\nnever lost consciousness and was referring to physical abnormalities when he mentioned “consciousness”\nduring his deposition. It was within the province of the jury to determine what portions, if any, of\nProler’s testimony to believe.\n\n                                                       7\n\fCaptain Johnson, in addition to Chief Trevino’s past experience regarding Proler’s\nreputation for being “scared to go into fires.”\nIn his letter, Captain Johnson explained that during the March 2006 fire, Proler (1) left\nhis uniform open despite repeated orders to dress properly, (2) responded he\nunderstood orders but failed to complete any assignments, (3) did not supervise or\ndirect his firefighters, and (4) stood in the center of a smoke-filled room as if “in\nshock.” Captain Johnson noted that he realized Proler was “not functioning\nrationally” and “there could possibly be something medically wrong with him.”\nCaptain Johnson also noted medics determined Proler had low blood pressure.\nFinally, Captain Johnson opined Proler “could not function at all” for one of two\nreasons: “Either he was scared . . . or there was an acute medical emergency that\nconsumed him.”\nIn his letter, Chief Seamans acknowledged receipt of Captain Johnson’s letter and\nadded the following information regarding Proler’s behavior and condition during the\nMarch 2006 fire: (1) Proler seemed disoriented and could not follow or give orders;\n(2) Proler would nod in affirmation when given orders, but then murmur to himself\nand make “motions that were not sensible, such as fiddling with a redline nozzle that\nhad been laid upon the ground for exposure protection”; (3) an HFD chief present at\nthe time told Johnson “that something was not right” with Proler; (4) Proler was “very\npale and appeared to be weak and wobbly”; (5) Proler had low blood pressure and\npossibly low blood sugar; and (6) Proler’s diagnosis at the hospital might have been\n“slight stroke and/or other acute medical condition.” Chief Seamans requested a “full\ninvestigation and evaluation” and stated, “If [Proler] has some type of medical or\npsychiatric condition that precludes his safe behavior at fire or other emergency\nscenes, then he should be removed from emergency response work until such time as\nthe situation is resolved.” Chief Seamans also detailed Proler’s past and present\nreputation for having a fear of firefighting and disclosed that other firefighters have\nsaid Proler’s “head goes out on him” when faced with severe fire-suppression\nconditions.\nChief Trevino testified that based on the information contained in these letters, he had\nsafety concerns because Proler had been unable to dress properly, respond to simple\norders, or lead his firefighters. Chief Trevino interpreted Chief Seaman’s request as\nasking “for [HFD] to get to the bottom of what happened out at the fire scene; what’s\nat issue with Captain Proler.” Chief Trevino testified that he transferred Proler “until\nwe could sort things out as far as what difficulties he was . . . dealing with.”\nAccording to Chief Trevino, he told Proler that he would be transferred until further\nnotice because Chief Trevino “needed to talk to some other people . . . to see what we\nwere going to do about it.”\nAfter Proler was evaluated at the scene of the March 2006 fire, he was brought by\nambulance to a hospital where he remained for several days. Shortly thereafter, HFD\nreceived a document in which a doctor indicated that Proler had suffered an episode\n\n                                          8\n\f   of global transient amnesia. The doctor released Proler to “full duty” beginning April\n   1, 2006.\n   Chief Boriskie testified that HFD requested a medical evaluation of Proler and was\n   informed he had suffered an episode of global transient amnesia. HFD sent a letter to\n   James Ferrendelli, M.D., requesting clarification regarding whether Proler would\n   suffer a recurrence of amnesia and whether he could safely perform the duties of an\n   HFD captain. Enclosed with HFD’s letter was a document detailing Proler’s job\n   description. Both Chief Boriskie and Chief Trevino testified that Dr. Ferrendelli\n   failed to clarify these issues in his subsequent response.\n   Following the March 2006 fire, Proler was not allowed to transfer from the academy\n   for thirteen months, at which time HFD transferred him to a suppression unit pursuant\n   to the hearing examiner’s award. While Proler was stationed at the academy, HFD\n   never required him to submit to a medical examination.\n\n   According to Proler, at the time of trial, he had been working in a fire suppression unit\n   for between one and two years and had not suffered any similar amnesia episodes\n   during that time. Proler also testified that he is unaware of “any medical, physical or\n   mental condition [he has]” that creates a safety issue for him or his firefighters.\n\n       Considering these facts in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, we\nconclude the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the verdict. As noted\nabove, the jury was charged that it could find the City regarded Proler as having a\nsubstantially limiting impairment if Proler “[1] does not have an impairment at all, [2] but\nis regarded by the employer as having such a substantially limiting impairment.”\n\n       Regarding the first part of this definition, Proler testified he had not suffered\namnesia since being transferred to a suppression unit over one year before trial and does\nnot have any medical condition that poses a safety concern to him or his firefighters.\nAdditionally, the emergency-room doctor who treated Proler following the March 2006\nfire released Proler to full-duty action beginning April 1, 2006. This evidence is legally\nsufficient to support the jury’s finding Proler does not, in actuality, suffer from an\nimpairment. Moreover, this evidence is not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of\nthe evidence as to render the jury’s finding clearly wrong and unjust. In sum, the jury\ncould have reasonably found that Proler’s episode of amnesia was an isolated incident—\nnot a substantially limiting impairment.\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       We also conclude the evidence supports the jury’s finding regarding the second\npart of the “regarded-as” definition—did the City regard Proler as having a substantially\nlimiting impairment? During the March 2006 fire, Proler was unable to follow orders or\ndress properly, and he muttered, wobbled, and stood in a smoke-filled room, appearing to\nbe in a state of “shock.”       Captain Johnson opined that Proler was unaware of his\nsurroundings and “could not function at all.” Proler also engaged in nonsensical actions,\nsuch as “fiddling” with a nozzle.       Several individuals opined that something was\nmedically wrong with Proler, and he was later diagnosed as having suffered global\ntransient amnesia. In the past, other firefighters had complained that Proler’s “head goes\nout on him” when he faces severe fire conditions. After receiving a medical report in\nwhich Proler was cleared to return to full-duty action, HFD asked Dr. Ferrendelli to\nclarify whether Proler would suffer amnesia in the future and whether he could continue\nto perform as an HFD captain. According to Chief Boriskie and Chief Trevino, Dr.\nFerrendelli’s response was unsatisfactory. However, instead of sending Proler to a doctor\nfor further evaluation, HFD refused to transfer Proler from the academy for thirteen\nmonths, at which time HFD acquiesced to the hearing examiner’s award and transferred\nProler to a suppression unit.\n\n       When determining whether the employer regarded the plaintiff as disabled, we\nmust consider the employer’s state of mind at the time the alleged discrimination\noccurred; this determination is predicated on the specific facts of each case and usually\nmust be proved by circumstantial evidence. See Ross v. Campbell Soup Co., 237 F.3d\n701, 706 (6th Cir. 2001). We conclude the evidence supports a finding the City regarded\nProler as having a recurring physiological or mental impairment that caused him to suffer\nepisodes during which his cognitive ability was diminished to the point he was unaware\nof his surroundings for at least several minutes. Axiomatically, the average person in the\ngeneral population does not suffer similar episodes.       Hence, the jury could have\nreasonably found that the City regarded Proler as significantly restricted relative to the\ncondition, manner, or duration under which he was able to perform the major life activity\n\n\n                                            10\n\fof “thinking” compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average\nperson in the general population is able to “think.” See Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch.\nDist., 184 F.3d 296, 309 (3d Cir. 1999) (“Chronic, episodic conditions can easily limit\nhow well a person performs an activity as compared to the rest of the population.”); see\nalso Otting v. J.C. Penney Co., 223 F.3d 704, 710–11 (8th Cir. 2000) (determining\nevidence that plaintiff suffered from thirty-second to two-minute long seizures two or\nthree times a month during which she was unable to see, hear, speak, walk, or work (and\nwould suffer after-effects for ten minutes to three days) sufficient to support finding\nplaintiff was disabled).9 Accordingly, we conclude the evidence is legally sufficient to\nsupport a finding that the City erroneously believed Proler was disabled as defined in the\njury charge.10\n\n\n\n\n        9\n           We recognize that the United States Supreme Court declared the phrase “substantially limited”\nshould be “interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled.” Toyota Motor\nMfg., Ky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 196–97 (2002). The Supreme Court defined “substantially\nlimited” as “an impairment that prevents or severely restricts.” Id. In this context, “severe” means “of a\ngreat degree.” Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1078 (9th ed. 1991). However, in Proler’s\njury charge, “substantially limited” was defined as something that “significantly restricts.” “Significant”\nmeans “of a noticeably or measurably large amount.” Id. at 1096. Based on these definitions, it is easier\nfor a party to establish a “significant restriction” than a “severe restriction.” We hold that the jury could\nhave reasonably determined the City regarded Proler as restricted by “a noticeably large amount” in his\nability to “think” compared to the average person’s ability to “think.” We cannot conclude it was\nunreasonable for the jury to determine that an inability to “think,” even if intermittent, was a significant\nrestriction.\n        10\n           We disagree with our dissenting colleague that reasonable and fair-minded jurors could not\nconclude the City regarded Proler as suffering from a substantially limiting impairment as defined in the\njury charge. Despite receiving an inadequate response from Dr. Ferrendelli regarding Proler’s medical\ncondition, the City retained Proler at the academy for over a year without requiring him to undergo\nadditional medical testing. This evidence supports a finding the City believed that, at any moment, Proler\nmight suffer a debilitating episode during which he is unable to the “think” normally. The jury could\nhave reasonably determined that HFD (1) would not have requested additional information from Dr.\nFerrendelli if HFD had transferred Proler solely because of his fear of firefighting or (2) would have\nordered additional medical testing if HPD were unsure whether Proler’s condition was merely a\ntemporary, singular occurrence.\n        We also note that under the definition of “motivating factor” in the jury charge, the City\ncommitted employment discrimination if it decided to transfer Proler because he was afraid of fire\nsuppression and suffered from a disability. Thus, evidence supporting a finding that Proler’s supervisors\nconsidered him to be afraid of firefighting is not detrimental to the jury’s finding.\n\n                                                     11\n\f       We also conclude the evidence is factually sufficient to support the jury’s verdict.\nAdmittedly, the evidence supports a finding that the City transferred Proler because it\nbelieved he feared firefighting and was unfit to supervise a suppression unit, not because\nhe was disabled. Nevertheless, as described above, there is also evidence supporting a\nfinding that the City regarded Proler as having a recurring disability. In their letters,\nCaptain Johnson and Chief Seamans explained that Proler may have been suffering from\nan acute medical condition. Chief Trevino testified that he retained Proler at the academy\nbecause Chief Trevino was unsure of the nature of Proler’s condition. Further, in HFD’s\nletter to Dr. Ferrendelli, HFD recognized Proler had been diagnosed as having suffered\nglobal transient amnesia and released to full-duty work, but inquired whether Proler\nwould suffer a relapse and whether he could safely perform the functions of a fire-\nsuppression captain. After receiving an unsatisfactory response from Dr. Ferrendelli,\nHFD did not conduct further medical inquiry into Proler’s condition and refused to\ntransfer him from the academy.          Chief Trevino admitted he never received any\ninformation indicating that Proler was unable to discharge his duties as captain. This\nevidence supports a finding that the City regarded Proler as suffering from recurring\nepisodes during which he was unable to “think.” This finding is not so contrary to the\noverwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. See Cain, 709\nS.W.2d at 176.\n\n       Accordingly, we conclude the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to\nsupport the jury’s verdict and overrule Proler’s first issue.\n\n                                    III. JURY CHARGE\n\n       In its second issue, the City contends the trial court erred by refusing to submit the\nCity’s proffered instructions in the jury charge.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n       A trial court’s decision whether to submit a particular instruction in its charge is\nreviewed for abuse of discretion. Shupe v. Lingafelter, 192 S.W.3d 577, 579 (Tex. 2006)\n\n\n                                              12\n\f(per curiam). When a trial court refuses to submit a requested instruction, the relevant\nquestion on appeal is whether the requested instruction was reasonably necessary to\nenable the jury to render a proper verdict.          Tex. Workers’ Comp. Ins. Fund v.\nMandlbauer, 34 S.W.3d 909, 912 (Tex. 2000). The trial court has great latitude and\nconsiderable discretion to determine the necessary and proper jury instructions, and any\nerror regarding a requested instruction will not be reversed unless it probably caused\nrendition of an improper judgment. Louisiana–Pacific Corp. v. Knighten, 976 S.W.2d\n674, 676 (Tex. 1998).\n\nB. Analysis\n\n       The City complains regarding the trial court’s refusal to submit two instructions.\nFirst, the City offered the following expanded definition of “substantially limits” as\napplied to the major life activity of working; the italicized sentences are those added by\nthe City:\n\n       “Substantially limits” (as applied to the major life activity[] of “working”)\n       means that an individual is restricted in the ability to perform either a class\n       of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the\n       average person having comparable training, skills, and abilities. To be\n       substantially limited in the major life activity of working, then, one must be\n       precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular\n       job choice. The impairment must substantially limit employment generally.\n       The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a\n       substantial limitation in the major life activity of working. A physical or\n       mental impairment that affects the claimant’s ability to engage in a narrow\n       range of jobs only or a particular job alone does not “substantially limit”\n       one or more major life activities.\n\n(citations omitted, emphasis added).\n\n       Second, the City submitted the following instruction regarding “temporariness”:\n\n       Merely having an impairment does not make one disabled for purposes of\n       the discrimination laws. In order to prevail, Proler must have shown that\n       [HFD] treated him as if he had a substantially limiting impairment. To be\n       considered a disability, the impairments [sic] impact must be permanent or\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f        long-term. Temporary, non-chronic impairments of short duration, with\n        little or no permanent long-term impact are not disabilities.\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n        We hold that the trial court did not err by refusing the City’s requested definition\nfor “substantially limits” as applied to “working.” The additional sentences merely\nreiterate the other sentences in instruction (which were submitted to the jury), namely,\nthat an impairment substantially limits Proler’s ability to work only if the impairment\nrestricts his ability to perform a wide range of jobs.              The trial court acted within its\ndiscretion by refusing this definition.11\n\n        Regarding the “temporariness” instruction, we agree that an impairment must\ngenerally be permanent or long-term, not merely temporary, to qualify as a disability\nunder the ADA and TCHRA.                  See, e.g., Columbia Plaza Med. Ctr. of Fort Worth\nSubsidiary, L.P. v. Szurek, 101 S.W.3d 161, 166–68 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003, pet.\ndenied) (“An impairment simply cannot be a substantial limitation on a major life activity\nif it is expected to improve in a relatively short period of time.”); see also 29 C.F.R. pt.\n1630, app. § 1630.2(j) (2010 version) (“[T]emporary, non-chronic impairments of short\nduration, with little or no long term or permanent impact, are usually not disabilities.”).\nWe also recognize Proler testified his amnesia was an isolated occurrence and that, days\nafter the incident, a physician cleared Proler for return to full-duty work. These facts\nstrongly support a finding that Proler suffered a temporary impairment on the day of the\nfire. However, Proler’s theory of liability was not whether he was actually disabled but\nwhether the City regarded him as disabled. It is undisputed the City refused to transfer\nProler from the academy for more than a year, at which time the City transferred Proler\nonly because of the hearing examiner’s order. These facts strongly support a finding that\nthe City did not regard Proler’s impairment as temporary, but permanent and recurring.12\n\n        11\n          We also note that Proler argued to the jury the major life activity of working was inapplicable\nand should not be considered. Accordingly, even if the court erred by refusing the City’s definition, such\nerror was harmless.\n        12\n             During closing statements, Proler argued,\n\n                                                     14\n\fThus, we hold that the trial court’s refusal to submit the instruction, even if erroneous, did\nnot probably cause rendition of an improper judgment.                  The City’s second issue is\noverruled.\n\n                                    IV. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\n       We next address the City’s fourth issue, in which the City contends the trial court\nerred by granting Proler’s request for an injunction because no evidence supported such\nrelief. The trial court awarded the following injunctive relief:\n\n       In accordance with the jury’s verdict that the City acted with respect to\n       [Proler] in violation of state and federal law proscribing employment\n       discrimination on account of perceived disability, and evidence from which\n       the court finds that Proler and individuals similarly situated should be\n       protected from future unlawful conduct, it is\n              ORDERED that the City of Houston shall not in any manner further\n       discriminate against [Proler] or retaliate against [Proler] because of his\n       claims of discrimination, the presentation of the grievance related thereto,\n       and the filing of his counterclaim.\n             ORDERED that the City of Houston shall not discriminate in its\n       assignments of [Proler] because of any perceived physical or mental\n       impairment without utilizing the proceedings required by Tex. Loc. Gov’t\n       Code § 143.1115(a).\n\n       Under section 21.258 of the Labor Code, “On finding that a respondent engaged in\nan unlawful employment practice as alleged in a complaint, a court may: (1) prohibit by\ninjunction the respondent from engaging in an unlawful employment practice; and (2)\norder additional equitable relief as may be appropriate.”                 Tex. Lab. Code Ann. §\n21.258(a) (West 2006). The injunctive relief afforded under this statute results in a\npermanent injunction because the statute requires a finding on the ultimate issue in an\nemployment-discrimination case. San Antonio Water Sys. v. Odem, No. 04-07-00130-\n\n       Well, the City and [HFD] would say: [Proler was incapacitated for] maybe just one\n       incident. Maybe he was - - he could be considered disabled at that particular point and\n       for those days, but that would not have anything to do over a long period of time. Well,\n       how can they assert that and argue that, if for more than one year Chief Trevino would\n       not let him get out of the assignment to a training academy, because of the information he\n       had received which, as I have shown you, very specifically met the test of a disability?\n\n                                                  15\n\fCV, 2007 WL 2376147, at *4 (Tex. App.—San Antonio Aug. 22, 2007, no pet.) (mem.\nop.). Generally, to establish entitlement to a permanent injunction, the requesting party\nmust plead and prove the following: (1) a wrongful act; (2) imminent harm; (3)\nirreparable injury; and (4) no adequate remedy at law. Jordan v. Landry’s Seafood Rest.,\nInc., 89 S.W.3d 737, 742 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, pet. denied). However,\nthe parties disagree regarding whether Proler must satisfy the general permanent-\ninjunction elements under section 21.258.\n\n        The City argues that the applicant for an injunction under section 21.258 must\nprove the general elements for a permanent injunction.13 The City relies on Town of\nPalm Valley v. Johnson, 87 S.W.3d 110 (Tex. 2001) (per curiam). In Johnson, the court\nof appeals held that an injunction may be granted under section 65.011(1) of the Civil\nPractice and Remedies Code without demonstrating irreparable injury. Id. at 110. Under\nsection 65.011(1), “A writ of injunction may be granted if . . . the applicant is entitled to\nthe relief demanded and all or part of the relief requires the restraint of some act\nprejudicial to the applicant.”         Id. (quoting Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. §\n65.011(1)). In a per curiam opinion denying the appellant’s petition for review, the\nSupreme Court of Texas concluded, “[T]he statute does not permit injunctive relief\nwithout the showing of irreparable harm otherwise required by equity. If it did, the\nstatutory remedy would simply replace the equitable [right to injunctive relief], which\nrequires the additional showing.”            Id. at 111; see also Kendall Appraisal Dist. v.\nCordillera Ranch, Ltd., No. 04-03-00150-CV, 2003 WL 21696901, at *2–3 (Tex. App.—\n\n\n\n        13\n           Proler sought an injunction under both section 21.258 and the federal counterpart provision, 42\nU.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(g)(1) (incorporated into the ADA by 42 U.S.C.A. § 12117). In its appellate brief, the\nCity cites Texas cases for the proposition that applicants for statutory injunctive relief must prove\nirreparable injury and no adequate remedy at law; the City does not cite any Texas or federal cases\ninvolving the requirements for obtaining federal statutory injunctive relief. The City concludes the\nargument section of this issue by contending, “Plaintiff has not [established he is] currently suffering an\nirreparable injury as a result of any alleged violation of the ADA or the TCHRA.” We conclude the City\nwaived any argument that the trial court erred by issuing the injunction based on the federal provision\nbecause the City did not support this argument with citation to any authorities. See Tex. R. App. P.\n38.1(i).\n\n                                                    16\n\fSan Antonio July 23, 2003, no pet.) (mem. op.) (recognizing Johnson court held applicant\nfor injunction under section 65.011(1) must prove irreparable harm).\n\n       In contrast, Proler contends section 21.258 dispenses with the general equitable\nelements and provides the trial court discretion to grant injunctive relief upon a finding\nthat an employer committed an unlawful employment practice.              Proler argues that\nJohnson is inapplicable because it concerned the general injunction statute, whereas\nmany courts have recognized an applicant need not prove the general equitable elements,\nsuch as imminent harm, irreparable injury, and inadequate remedy at law, when seeking\ninjunctive relief provided by a specific statute. See, e.g., State v. Tex. Pet Foods, Inc.,\n591 S.W.2d 800, 804–05 (Tex. 1979) (“The doctrine of balancing the equities has no\napplication to this statutorily authorized injunctive relief.”); 8100 N.

But see GADV, Inc. v. Beaumont Indep. Sch.\nDist., No. 09-11-00483-CV, 2011 WL 6229786, at *1–4 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Dec. 15,\n2011, no pet.) (mem. op.)

App.—Dallas 1983, no writ)\n(concluding general equitable elements apply when statutory injunction is permissive).\nWe agree with Proler.\n\n       Under section 21.258, upon a finding that an employer committed an unlawful\nemployment practice, the trial court may issue an injunction prohibiting the employer\nfrom engaging in unlawful employment practices. Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.258(a).\nHence, the requirements for injunctive relief are defined by a specific statute, superseding\nthe equitable requirements generally applicable to common-law injunctive relief. See\nMortgageBanc & Trust, Inc. v. State, 718 S.W.2d 865, 869 (Tex. App.—Austin 1986, no\nwrit); see also Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 65.001 (West 2008) (“The principles\ngoverning courts of equity govern injunction proceedings if not in conflict with this\nchapter or other law.”). Additionally, the Johnson court’s holding that injunctive relief\nunder section 65.011(1) requires a showing of irreparable harm is distinguishable because\nthe court considered the general injunction statute, not the separate injunctive-relief\nprovision of a specific act, such as the TCHRA. See Cardinal Health Staffing Network,\nInc. v. Bowen, 106 S.W.3d 230, 235, 240–41 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, no\npet.) (“[T]he default rule, created by chapter 65 and the rules of civil procedure, is that\nthe rules of equity control the granting of temporary-injunctive relief unless a particular\n\n\n                                             18\n\fstatute provides otherwise.”); Rutherford Oil Corp. v. Gen. Land Office of State of Tex.,\n776 S.W.2d 232, 236 n.5 (Tex. App.—Austin 1989, no writ) (recognizing section 65.011\nis general injunction statute); Injunction—Necessity of Inadequate Remedy at Law When\nStatute Authorizes Injunction, 14 Tex. L. Rev. 266, 267 (1936) (“Article 4642\n[predecessor to 65.011] is to be distinguished from statutes authorizing injunctions in\nspecific instances, as in the case of gaming and disorderly houses[.] The law seems\nsettled that in such cases injunctions may be issued regardless of adequate legal\nremedies.”).\n\n        Accordingly, Proler was not required to establish irreparable harm or that he had\nno adequate remedy at law when pursuing an injunction under section 21.258. This\nconclusion is consistent with legislative intent to reduce unlawful employment practices\nbecause an applicant may readily seek injunctive relief and discourage a violating\nemployer from continuing such practices. See Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.001(4) (West\n2006) (listing as one of the purposes of TCHRA, to “secure for persons in this state,\nincluding persons with disabilities, freedom from discrimination in certain employment\ntransactions, in order to protect their personal dignity”); see also Burlington N. & Santa\nFe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 72 (2006) (“[T]hroughout its history, [the ADA] has\nprovided for injunctions to bar like discrimination in the future, an important form of\nrelief.” (citation omitted)).14      In fact, many statutes include specific injunctive-relief\n\n        14\n            We recognize that when interpreting a provision of the TCHRA, we consider how federal\ncourts have interpreted similar provisions of the ADA. In re United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 307 S.W.3d 299,\n308 (Tex. 2010); see also Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.001(1), (3) (listing as purposes of TCHRA, inter\nalia, to “provide for the execution of the policies of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its\nsubsequent amendments” and “Title I of the [ADA] and its subsequent amendments”). In eBay Inc. v.\nMercExchange, L.L.C., the United States Supreme Court concluded an applicant for injunctive relief\nunder the Patent Act must prove irreparable injury and no adequate remedy at law, despite the fact that\nthe act did not expressly mandate such requirements. 547 U.S. 388, 391–92 (2006). The Court explained\n“a major departure from the long tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied” and noted the\nPatent Act specifically provided that an injunction may issue “in accordance with the principles of\nequity.” Id. (citations omitted).\n        At least one federal district court has relied on eBay to conclude that an applicant must establish\nirreparable injury and no adequate remedy at law when seeking injunctive relief under the ADA\ncounterpart of section 21.258. See E.E.O.C. v. DCP Medstream, L.P., 608 F. Supp. 2d 107, 110 (D. Me.\n2009); see also 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(g)(1) (incorporated into the ADA by 42 U.S.C.A. § 12117).

Ford Motor Co., 84 S.W.3d 198, 209–10 (Tex. 2002)\n(concluding statutory violation does not permit injunctive relief without a showing of no\nadequate legal remedy unless statute itself contains an injunction provision).15\n\n        We conclude this section by addressing an argument the City appears to raise in its\nthird issue regarding attorney’s fees.           The City contends that in addition to section\n21.258, Proler sought injunctive relief pursuant to section 143.1115 of the Local\nGovernment Code. Section 143.1115 governs the procedure the City must apply when\ndetermining whether a firefighter is “sufficiently physically or mentally fit to continue the\nperson’s duties or assignment.” Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Ann. § 143.1115 (West 2008). As\nnoted above, when granting injunctive relief, the trial court ordered the City to refrain\nfrom discriminating against Proler because of any perceived physical or mental\nimpairment without utilizing the procedure required under section 143.1115(a). The\nevidence supports a finding that the City failed to comply with this procedure in\ndetermining Proler was physically and mentally unfit to continue in fire suppression,\ninstead treating Proler as disabled without medical evidence establishing such disability.\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not grant injunctive relief pursuant to section\n\n\nbefore eBay, some federal courts required proof of these elements before issuance of an injunction under\nthe counterpart provision. See, e.g., Sanchez v. Philip Morris, Inc., 774 F. Supp. 626, 630–31 (W.D.\nOkla. 1991). We decline to adopt this rationale in our interpretation of section 21.258. As noted,\npreventing employers from engaging in unlawful employment practices is a primary purpose of the\ninjunctive relief provided in section 21.258, and rigid application of equity principles would stifle this\npurpose. See O’Sullivan v. City of Chicago, 478 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1043–44 & n.6 (N.D. Ill. 2007)\n(determining eBay inapplicable in Title VII case and plaintiffs seeking injunction were not required to\nprove irreparable injury or inadequate remedy at law); cf. also Silver Sage Partners, Ltd. v. City of Desert\nHot Springs, 251 F.3d 814, 827 (9th Cir. 2001) (“[W]here a defendant has violated a civil rights statute,\nwe will presume that the plaintiff has suffered irreparable injury for the fact of the defendant’s\nviolation.”); Middleton-Keirn v. Stone, 655 F.2d 609, 611–12 (5th Cir. 1981) (determining irreparable\ninjury presumed when state employee who files Title VII discrimination claim seeks preliminary\ninjunction).\n        15\n           Of course, use of the word “may” in section 21.258 means that a trial court has discretion to\naward injunctive relief. See Jones v. Jefferson Cnty., 15 S.W.3d 206, 213 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2000,\npet. denied) (holding that when statute does not mandate injunctive relief, “the granting or denial of\ninjunctive relief remains within the sound discretion of the trial court”). A trial court may consider the\nunique circumstances of each case when deciding whether injunctive relief is appropriate.\n\n                                                    20\n\f143.1115, but properly referenced the section in its injunction based on section 21.258.\nCf. Computek Computer & Office Supplies v. Walton, 156 S.W.3d 217, 220–21 (Tex.\nApp.—Dallas 2005, no pet.) (explaining injunction should be broad enough to prevent\nrepetition of wrong sought to be corrected but not so broad that defendant is enjoined\nfrom lawful activities). We overrule the City’s fourth issue.\n\n                     V. APPEAL OF HEARING EXAMINER’S AWARD\n\n       In its fifth issue, the City contends the trial court erred by granting Proler’s motion\nto dismiss the City’s appeal of the hearing examiner’s award.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n       When the defendant files a plea to the jurisdiction challenging the plaintiff’s\npleadings, the trial court determines whether the plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to\ndemonstrate subject-matter jurisdiction. Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133\nS.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex. 2004). To make this determination, the court considers the\npleader’s intent and construes the pleadings liberally in favor of jurisdiction. Id. If the\nfactual allegations of the pleadings neither affirmatively demonstrate that the trial court\nhas jurisdiction nor affirmatively demonstrate incurable jurisdictional defects, the issue is\none of pleading sufficiency and the plaintiff should be afforded an opportunity to amend.\nId. at 226–27. If the pleadings affirmatively negate jurisdiction, the court should sustain\nthe plea and dismiss the suit without allowing the plaintiff an opportunity to amend. Id.\nat 227. We review de novo the trial court’s ruling on a plea to the jurisdiction. Tex.\nNatural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 855 (Tex. 2002).\n\nB. Analysis\n\n       As an initial matter, Proler argues the City is barred from challenging the trial\ncourt’s ruling on Proler’s plea to the jurisdiction. Specifically, Proler notes that, after the\ntrial court granted Proler’s plea, the City appealed the interlocutory order to our court.\nCity of Houston v. Proler, 14-08-00110-CV, 2008 WL 2574360, at *1 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] June 26, 2008, no pet.) (mem. op.) (per curiam). After Proler filed a\n\n                                              21\n\fmotion to dismiss for want of prosecution, the City voluntarily filed its own motion to\ndismiss, which our court granted. Id. Proler contends the City is barred from seeking\nappellate review of the trial court’s order because our court already dismissed an\ninterlocutory appeal of the order. We disagree.\n\n       Although we ultimately dismissed the City’s prior interlocutory appeal based on\nthe City’s own motion, there was no authority whereby the City was permitted to file that\nappeal. Generally, a party may appeal only a final judgment. See Lehmann v. Har-Con\nCorp., 39 S.W.3d 191, 195 (Tex. 2001). However, a party may appeal an interlocutory\norder in which the trial court “grants or denies a plea to the jurisdiction by a\ngovernmental unit.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 51.014(a)(8) (West Supp.\n2011) (emphasis added). Under this provision, an interlocutory appeal is not available if\nthe plea to the jurisdiction was not made by a governmental unit. Baylor Coll. of Med. v.\nHernandez, 208 S.W.3d 4, 7–8 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied).\n\n       Here, the plea to the jurisdiction was made by Proler, not a governmental unit.\nThus, the City did not have a right to interlocutory appeal and has not yet had an\nopportunity to seek review of the trial court’s order granting Proler’s plea. Thus, we will\naddress the merits of City’s fifth issue.\n\n       The City contends that it pleaded sufficient facts to establish the trial court’s\njurisdiction under section 143.1016(j). A hearing examiner’s award is appealable to a\ndistrict court only on grounds the examiner “was without jurisdiction or exceeded [his]\njurisdiction or that the order was procured by fraud, collusion, or other unlawful means.”\nTex. Loc. Gov’t Code Ann. § 143.1016. A hearing examiner exceeds his jurisdiction\nwhen his acts are not authorized by the Fire Fighters and Police Officers Civil Service\nAct16 or are contrary to the Act, or invade the policy-setting realm protected by the\nnondelegation doctrine. City of Pasadena v. Smith, 292 S.W.3d 14, 21 (Tex. 2009).\n\n\n\n\n       16\n            See Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 143.001–.403 (West 2008 & Supp. 2011)\n\n                                                 22\n\f       In its petition, the City alleged, “On May 9, 2007 the Hearing Examiner issued the\naward, and overturned the Fire Chief’s decision not to transfer Proler. The Hearing\nExaminer awarded monetary relief to Proler in the form of overtime compensation when\nit was admitted or there was no evidence that he had ever worked any overtime.”\nNotably, the City also asserted, the Hearing Examiner “exceeded any jurisdiction he did\nhave by making this particular ruling,” and “[The City] respectfully requests a declaration\nthat the Third-Party Hearing Examiner exceeded his jurisdiction and abused his lawful\nauthority when he granted Captain Proler’s transfer, and overturned the Fire Chief’s\ndenial of transfer as well as allowing for the recovery of moneys for work that was never\nperformed.”\n\n       On appeal, the City argues it properly pleaded that the hearing examiner exceeded\nhis jurisdiction by awarding Proler overtime pay for hours he did not work. We agree.\nThe City satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of section 143.1016(j), and\naffirmatively demonstrated the trial court’s jurisdiction, by alleging that the hearing\nexaminer exceeded his jurisdiction when he awarded unearned overtime compensation.17\nThe City does not challenge any other portion of the trial court’s order granting Proler’s\nplea. Thus, we reverse the trial court’s order dismissing the City’s appeal to the extent\nthe City claims the hearing examiner exceeded his jurisdiction by awarding overtime\ncompensation and requests declaratory relief relative to this issue.18 We affirm the\nremainder of the order. The City’s fifth issue is sustained.\n\n\n\n\n       17\n            We make no determination regarding whether the hearing examiner actually exceeded his\njurisdiction, i.e., the merits of the City’s claim.\n       18\n          A trial court has jurisdiction to make a declaration regarding whether a hearing examiner\nexceeded his jurisdiction when the court also has jurisdiction under section 143.1016(j). See City of\nHouston v. Clark, 252 S.W.3d 561, 565 n.3 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.); City of\nHouston v. Williams, 99 S.W.3d 709, 713 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.).\n\n                                                 23\n\f                                      VI. ATTORNEY’S FEES\n\n       Finally, we address the City’s third issue, in which it contends the trial court erred\nby awarding attorney’s fees in an amount disproportionate to the jury’s determination of\n$0.00 in actual damages. The trial court awarded fees as follows:\n\n       ORDERED that the City of Houston pay to [Proler] and his attorney, David\n       T. López, as attorney’s fees related to the City’s declaratory judgment\n       action, the sum of Sixty-seven Thousand, One Hundred and Sixty Dollars\n       ($67,160.00): pay to [Proler] and his attorney David T. López, as attorney’s\n       fees related to Proler’s claim of unlawful employment discrimination, the\n       sum of $361,700.00/00 and the costs of this action in the sum of\n       $17,182.34, all with interest thereon at the rate of Five Percent (5%) per\n       annum from the date of the judgment.\n\n       We first address the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees relative to the City’s\ndeclaratory-judgment action. As explained above, we have reversed the portion of the\ntrial court’s order dismissing the City’s claim that the hearing examiner exceeded his\njurisdiction by awarding Proler overtime compensation, including the City’s request for\ndeclaratory relief. Because the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees relative to the City’s\ndeclaratory-judgment action was likely predicated on erroneous dismissal of the action,\nwe reverse the portion of the trial court’s judgment awarding Proler attorney’s fees\nrelative to the City’s declaratory-judgment action. See Young v. Qualls, 223 S.W.3d 312,\n314–15 (Tex. 2007) (per curiam).\n\n       We next address the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees relative to Proler’s\nemployment-discrimination claim. Under the TCHRA, the trial court may award the\nprevailing party attorney’s fees as costs. Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.259(a) (West 2006).\nIn Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc. v. Franco, the Supreme Court of Texas\nconsidered whether the plaintiff could recover attorney’s fees under section 21.259 when\nthe jury awarded no damages on his retaliatory-discharge claim. 971 S.W.2d 52, 55\n(Tex. 1997). Importantly, the court held that attorney’s fees were proper because the\nplaintiff was awarded equitable relief of reinstatement. Id. at 56.19 We conclude the trial\n\n       19\n            In Intercontinental Group Partnership v. KB Home Lone Star, L.P., the supreme court further\n                                                   24\n\fcourt properly awarded attorney’s fees to Proler under section 21.259 because (as we\nhave already affirmed) he was awarded injunctive relief. See Tex. Health & Human\nServs. Com’n v. Wolfe, No. 03-08-00413-CV, 2010 WL 2789777, at *9 (Tex. App.—\nAustin July 14, 2010, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (recognizing attorney’s fees under section\n21.259 may be based solely on prospective injunction).\n\n         Next, the City argues that the amount of fees awarded was unreasonable and\ndisproportionate to Proler’s relative success.             We review a trial court’s award of\nattorney’s fees under section 21.259 for abuse of discretion. Wolfe, 2010 WL 2789777,\nat *2. Generally, in considering whether attorney’s fees are reasonable, we are guided by\nthe non-exhaustive factors listed by the supreme court in Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry\nEquip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997).\n\n         In his original memorandum in support of his request for attorney’s fees, Proler\ndid not suggest that the trial court should utilize any special method for determining the\nreasonable amount of attorney’s fees. However, in his amended memorandum, 20 Proler\nasserted, “The appropriate way for calculating attorney’s fees in employment\ndiscrimination cases is the lodestar method.” (emphasis added). Proler then cited a case\nin which the lodestar method was used21 and presented argument regarding lodestar\nfactors.\n\n         We cannot determine from the record what method the trial court utilized in\ndetermining the reasonable amount of attorney’s fees. The City does not contend that the\nlodestar method was improper.22 Consequently, we will first review the trial court’s\n\nexplained its holding regarding attorney’s fees in Franco and disagreed with that portion of Franco in\nwhich the court determined a party prevailed who recovered no money or equitable relief. 295 S.W.3d\n650, 656 n.27 (Tex. 2009).\n         20\n           Although Proler used the term “amended” in the title of this memorandum, he expressly\nincorporated his original memorandum and explained that the “amended” memorandum supplemented the\noriginal. Thus, we treat the “amended” memorandum as a supplement to the original memorandum.\n         21\n              See Guity v. C.C.I. Enter., 54 S.W.3d 526, 528–29 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, no\npet.).\n         22\n          Because the City does not contend that the lodestar method is inappropriate in this context, we\ndo not decide this issue. However, we note there is Texas authority (which we neither accept nor reject)\n                                                    25\n\faward of fees using the lodestar method. We will consider reasonableness of the fees\nunder the usual factors only if we determine the trial court abused its discretion in\napplying the lodestar method. See Emp’rs Cas. Co. v. Tex. Ass’n of Sch. Bds. Workers’\nComp. Self Ins. Fund, 886 S.W.2d 470, 473 (Tex. App.—Austin 1994, writ dism’d w.o.j.)\n(recognizing appellate court may sustain judgment on any theory consistent with law and\nevidence when there are no findings of fact).\n\n        Under the lodestar method, a “lodestar amount” is calculated by multiplying the\nnumber of hours reasonably expended by an appropriate hourly rate in the community for\nsuch work. Heidtman v. Cnty. of El Paso, 171 F.3d 1038, 1043 (5th Cir. 1999). The\nlodestar amount may be adjusted upwards or downwards to account for certain factors.\nId.23 If some of the factors are accounted for in the lodestar amount, they should not be\nconsidered when making adjustments. Shipes v. Trinity Indus., 987 F.2d 311, 320 (5th\nCir. 1993).24\n\n\nsupporting that a trial court may properly utilize the lodestar method when determining fees under section\n21.259. See, e.g., Haggar Apparel Co. v. Leal, 100 S.W.3d 303, 315 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002)\n(“The lodestar method is appropriate in calculating attorney’s fees in employment discrimination cases.”),\nrev’d on other grounds, 154 S.W.3d 98 (Tex. 2004); W. Wendell Hall et al., Hall’s Standards of Review\nin Texas, 42 St. Mary’s L.J. 3, 215 (2010).\n        23\n            These factors include (1) time and labor required, (2) novelty and difficulty of the questions,\n(3) level of skill required, (4) effect on other employment by the attorney, (5) customary fee, (6) whether\nthe fee is fixed or contingent, (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances, (8) amount\ninvolved and the results obtained, (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorney, (10)\nundesirability of the case, (11) nature and length of the attorney’s relationship with the client, and (12)\nawards in similar cases. Johnson v. Ga. Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717–19 (5th Cir. 1974).\n        Since Johnson, the United States Supreme Court has limited which of these factors may be\nconsidered when increasing the lodestar amount. See Humphrey v. United Way of Tex. Gulf Coast, 802 F.\nSupp. 2d 847, 855 n.7 (S.D. Tex. 2011). It is unnecessary to elaborate on this caselaw because we limit\nour review to the reasonableness of fees awarded under Texas law, section 21.259, and thus need not\nfollow federal precedent. See footnote 24, infra.\n        24\n           Generally, when a trial court uses the lodestar method to determine the amount of an attorney’s\nfees award, the court must file findings of fact and conclusions of law detailing how it calculated fees.\nSee In re High Sulfur Content Gasoline Prods. Liab. Litig., 517 F.3d 220, 228 (5th Cir. 2008); see also\nTex. R. Civ. P. 42(h), (i) (requiring trial courts to utilize lodestar method when determining fees in a\nclass-action suit and to make findings of fact pertaining to the fees calculation). By reviewing the\nfindings, the appellate court may “determine whether the [trial] court has used proper factual criteria in\nexercising its discretion to fix just compensation.” In re High Sulfur, 517 F.3d at 228 (citation omitted).\n        In the present case, the trial court did not file, and the record does not reflect that either party\n                                                    26\n\f        The City has not challenged the reasonableness of López’s rate of $400.00 per\nhour. In fact, the City agrees that López is a board certified labor attorney, “well known\nin the employment law community.”                   Thus, the trial court could have properly\ndetermined that $400.00 per hour was a reasonable rate in this case.\n\n        In his affidavit regarding fees and invoices, López segregated his fees pertaining\nto the City’s suit for declaratory relief from fees pertaining to Proler’s employment-\ndiscrimination claim. López’s invoices reflect that from March 2006 to March 2010, he\nprovided 1,205.9 hours of legal services pertaining to the employment-discrimination\nclaim. The City complains that the trial court awarded nearly $60,000.00 in fees for legal\nservices provided before the City filed its claim for declaratory judgment on May 18,\n2007; however, the City does not cite any authority supporting its contention that fees\nincurred before commencement of litigation are unrecoverable. The City also argues\nProler filed excessive motions in an attempt to inflate his fees, including “the infamous\nrefiling of a motion for summary judgment that did not allege or argue any new issues”;\nhowever, the City does specifically cite any unnecessary filings listed in López’s\ninvoices.\n\n        Additionally, the City argues that the amount of fees awarded is disproportionate\nto the relative success of Proler’s employment-discrimination claim because the issues\ninvolved were simple, necessitated only two jury questions, and did not require expert\ntestimony. The City further notes that Proler presented minimal evidence regarding\ndamages, was awarded no damages, and ultimately received an injunction which he could\nhave pursued early in the litigation.\n\n\n\nrequested, findings. However, there is no binding Texas law requiring a trial court to file findings of fact\nwhen it uses the lodestar method to calculate fees under section 21.259. Further, the City does not argue\nProler should have segregated his ADA fees from his TCHRA fees. Therefore, we consider whether the\nfees were reasonable under section 21.259 and presume the trial court made all findings necessary to\nsupport its award. See Sixth RMA Partners, L.P. v. Sibley, 111 S.W.3d 46, 52 (Tex. 2003); Holt Atherton\nIndus., Inc. v. Heine, 835 S.W.2d 80, 83 (Tex. 1992).\n\n                                                    27\n\f       In his “amended” memorandum, Proler admitted that the issues involved in the\ncase were “not novel or unusual[.]”         Proler asserted that the lodestar amount was\n$482,360.00: the product of 1,205.9 hours multiplied by López’s $400.00 hourly rate.\nProler also suggested that, if the trial court determined the lodestar amount should be\nreduced due to Proler’s failure to recover monetary damages, the trial court should\ndecrease the amount by 10% but no more than 25%. Assuming that the trial court\naccepted Proler’s lodestar amount, the court apparently reduced the amount by 25%\nbecause it awarded $361,770.00 in fees, which is exactly a 25% reduction of\n$482,360.00.\n\n       The trial court could have reasonably disagreed with the City’s contention that\nProler should have sought injunctive relief early in the lawsuit and, thus, he must have\nextended the litigation in an effort to inflate fees. First, the trial court, as manager of this\ncase’s docket, was in a unique position to determine whether Proler purposefully\nextended the litigation over a four-year period and made unnecessary filings or whether\n(as Proler claims) the City’s lack of cooperation necessitated increased costs. See Jarvis\nv. Rocanville Corp., 298 S.W.3d 305, 318 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, pet. denied) (“When\na trial court sits as the trier of fact, the amount of a fee award generally rests in the sound\ndiscretion of the trial court, and its judgment will not be reversed on appeal absent a clear\nabuse of discretion.”).\n\n       Next, as noted above, prerequisite to injunctive relief under section 21.258 is a\nfinding that the employer engaged in an unlawful employment practice. See Tex. Lab.\nCode Ann. § 21.258. Thus, in order to obtain injunctive relief, Proler was required to\ndiscover and present evidence establishing that the City had committed employment\ndiscrimination. Further, the record supports a finding that Proler’s primary purpose in\ncountersuing the City was to obtain an injunction preventing future discrimination; Proler\npresented little evidence regarding damages but testified that he greatly desired to remain\nin fire suppression. Accordingly, it was within the trial court’s discretion to decrease the\nlodestar amount based on the lack of monetary damages but still award a substantial\n\n                                              28\n\famount of fees for López’s services in obtaining the requested injunctive relief. We\noverrule the City’s third issue.\n\n                                   VII. CONCLUSION\n\n       In sum, we reverse those portions of the trial court’s judgment (1) dismissing for\nwant of jurisdiction the City’s claim that the hearing examiner exceeded his jurisdiction\nby awarding overtime compensation and request for declaratory relief relative to this\nclaim and (2) awarding Proler attorney’s fees relative to the City’s declaratory-judgment\naction. We remand this claim and request for declaratory relief for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. We affirm the remainder of the trial court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                         /s/     Charles W.

PROLER, Appellee\n\n\n                       On Appeal from the 234th District Court\n                               Harris County, Texas\n                         Trial Court Cause No. 2007-30944\n\n\n                       MAJORITY OPINION\n\n       The City of Houston appealed to a district court an independent hearing\nexaminer’s award in favor of Shayn A. Proler. Proler filed a counterclaim against the\nCity under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and the Texas Commission on\nHuman Rights Act (“TCHRA”). The trial court dismissed for want of jurisdiction the\nCity’s claims and rendered judgment in favor of Proler, awarding him injunctive relief\nand attorney’s fees.\n\n       On appeal, the City presents five issues: (1) the evidence is legally and factually\ninsufficient to support the jury’s finding that the City engaged in employment\n\fdiscrimination; (2) the trial court erred by refusing the City’s proffered jury instructions;\n(3) the trial court erred by awarding Proler attorney’s fees; (4) the trial court erred by\ngranting Proler injunctive relief; and (5) the trial court erred by dismissing for want of\njurisdiction the City’s petition. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n\n                                          I. BACKGROUND\n\n        In the early 1990s, Proler joined the Houston Fire Department (“HFD”). During\n2002, he was promoted to captain and worked at a fire-suppression station where he\nsupervised multiple firefighters.1 In 2004, Executive Assistant Chief Hector Trevino\nreceived a letter in which allegations were made that Proler was “scared to go into fires,”\nleaving his crew to suppress fires unsupervised. Chief Trevino transferred Proler to an\nHFD training academy. Proler had various administrative responsibilities at the academy\nbut was not involved in fire suppression. According to Proler, members of HFD consider\nthe transfer of a non-injured firefighter to the academy as a disciplinary action.\n\n        Proler remained stationed at the academy for more than a year. During this time,\nHFD denied Proler’s requests for transfer to a suppression unit.                     Eventually, Chief\nTrevino agreed to transfer Proler if Proler could find a senior captain who would allow\nProler to join his suppression unit and evaluate Proler for several months. Proler met\nwith District Chief John C. Seamans and Senior Captain Roosevelt Johnson to discuss\nProler’s joining suppression station 59.            Proler assured Chief Seamans and Captain\nJohnson that Proler’s reputation for fear of firefighting was unfounded. Captain Johnson\npermitted Proler to join station 59.\n\n        During Proler’s tenure at station 59, Captain Johnson completed three written\nevaluations regarding Proler. In each evaluation, Captain Johnson gave Proler an overall\nrating of “effective” or “strong.” However, during the same time, several unnamed\nfirefighters made “off the record” complaints to Chief Seamans, alleging Proler was\n\n        1\n         Generally, a suppression station is manned by multiple firefighters, an engineer, a captain and/or\nsenior captain, and possibly a chief. The purpose of a suppression unit is to respond to a variety of\nemergencies, including suppression of building fires.\n\n                                                    2\n\f“either afraid of firefighting or that his ‘head goes out on him’ when faced with severe\nfire conditions.” Chief Seamans did not take action based on these complaints but\ndecided to continue evaluating Proler’s performance.\n\n         On March 26, 2006, station 59 and other units responded to a building fire. At the\nscene of the fire, Captain Johnson gave Proler several orders, including an order to\nprotect an adjacent building. Proler failed to complete any of his assignments. Proler\nalso did not comply with Captain Johnson’s repeated orders to wear his uniform properly.\nAt one point, Captain Johnson found Proler standing in a smoke-filled room. Proler was\nextracted and received medical attention. Medics determined Proler’s blood pressure was\nlow. Johnson and others suggested that Proler seek treatment at a hospital, but Proler\nrefused. Eventually, Proler was ordered to seek treatment. Proler was diagnosed as\nhaving suffered an episode of global transient amnesia.\n\n         After the March 2006 fire, Captain Johnson sent a letter to Chief Seamans,\nexpressing concerns regarding Proler’s behavior during the incident. In turn, Chief\nSeamans sent a letter to Fire Chief Phil Boriskie and Chief Trevino elaborating on these\nconcerns. In light of these letters, Chief Trevino transferred Proler to the academy.\nThereafter, Proler requested a transfer to a fire suppression unit, which Chief Trevino\ndenied.\n\n         Proler challenged the transfer denial through the administrative grievance\nprocess.2 After his step II grievance was unsuccessful, Proler appealed to an independent\nhearing examiner.3 During May 2007, the hearing examiner signed an order, directing\nHFD to transfer Proler to a suppression station and pay him certain lost compensation.\nPursuant to the hearing examiner’s award, the City transferred Proler to a suppression\nunit and paid him lost compensation.\n\n\n\n         2\n             See Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 143.127–.134 (West 2008 & Supp. 2011).\n         3\n             See Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 143.057; 143.1016 (West 2008); 143.129(d) (West Supp.\n2008).\n\n                                                    3\n\f       The City appealed the hearing examiner’s award to a district court, asserting that\nthe court had jurisdiction under the Local Government Code and the Declaratory\nJudgments Act.4 In his counterclaim under the ADA and TCHRA, Proler alleged that the\nCity discriminated against him based on perceived disability. Proler filed a plea to the\njurisdiction, arguing that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the City’s appeal. The\ntrial court granted the plea and dismissed the City’s claims for want of jurisdiction.\n\n       Following trial on Proler’s claim, the jury found that the City discriminated\nagainst Proler based on perceived disability. However, the jury awarded no damages.\nThe trial court rendered judgment on the jury’s verdict but also awarded Proler injunctive\nrelief and attorney’s fees.\n\n                          II. LEGAL AND FACTUAL SUFFICIENCY\n\n       In its first issue, the City contends the trial court erred by denying the City’s\nmotion for directed verdict or motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because\nthe evidence is legally insufficient to support a finding that Proler was “disabled” as\ndefined under the TCHRA and ADA. Appellant also challenges factual sufficiency of the\nevidence.\n\nA.

Analysis\n\n       In the jury charge, the trial court submitted the following question and instructions\nregarding the alleged unlawful employment practice, which mostly track the Texas\nPattern Jury Charge5:\n\n       Was disability (as defined below) a motivating factor (as defined below) in\n       the [City’s] decision to transfer [Proler] to the training academy of [HFD]\n       from March 28, 2006 until May 25, 2007?\n\n\n\n       5\n           See Texas Pattern Jury Charges PJC 107.6, 107.11 (2008).\n\n                                                    5\n\f              A “motivating factor” in an employment decision is a reason for\n        making the decision at the time it was made. There may be more than one\n        motivating factor for an employment decision.\n              “Disability” means being regarded as having a mental or physical\n        impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity.\n               The term “mental or physical impairment” means any physiological\n        disorder, condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting\n        one or more of the following body systems: neurological; musculoskeletal;\n        special sense organs; respiratory (including speech organs); cardiovascular;\n        reproductive; digestive; genitourinary; hemic; lymphatic; skin; and\n        endocrine; or any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental\n        retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and\n        specific learning disabilities.\n               “Major life activities” means functions such as caring for oneself,\n        performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing,\n        learning, thinking6 or working.\n                “Substantially limits” (as applied to “major life activities” other\n        than “working”) means that an individual is unable to perform a major life\n        activity that the average person in the general population can perform or\n        that an individual is significantly restricted as to the condition, manner, or\n        duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life\n        activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the\n        average person in the general population can perform that same major life\n        activity.\n                “Substantially limits” (as applied to the “major life activity” of\n        “working”) means that an individual is restricted in the ability to perform\n        either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as\n        compared to the average person having comparable training, skills, and\n        abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not\n        constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working\n               “Substantially limits” (as applied to the “major life activity” of\n        “performing manual tasks”) means that an individual is prevented or\n\n\n        6\n          At the time of trial, “thinking” was not specifically defined as a major life activity in the\nTCHRA or ADA. However, neither party objected to the inclusion of “thinking.” Thus, we review\nsufficiency of the evidence based on the charge actually submitted. See Osterberg v. Peca, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1580987\"><a href=\"/opinion/1580987/osterberg-v-peca/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n55 (Tex. 2000). Regardless, courts have held that “thinking” is a major life activity. See Taylor v.\nPhoenixville Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765245\"><a href=\"/opinion/765245/katherine-l-taylor-v-phoenixville-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 307 (3d Cir. 1999). Moreover, in the current TCHRA and ADA,\n“thinking” is defined as a major life activity. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 12102(2)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)(1)(i);\nTex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.002(11-a) (West Supp. 2011).\n\n                                                    6\n\f        severally restricted from doing activities that are of central importance to\n        most people’s daily lives.\n               “Being regarded as having such an impairment” means an\n        individual: (a) has a physical or mental impairment that does not\n        substantially limit a major life activity but is perceived by the employer as\n        having such a limitation; (b) has a physical or mental impairment that\n        substantially limits a major life activity only as a result of the attitudes of\n        others toward the impairment; or (c) does not have an impairment at all,\n        but is regarded by the employer as having such a substantially limiting\n        impairment.7\n\n        The City contends the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support a\nfinding the City regarded Proler as having an impairment that substantially limited a\nmajor life activity. We disagree. The following evidence supports a finding that the City\nregarded Proler as significantly restricted regarding the conditions under which he could\n“think” as compared to the conditions under which the average person is able to “think.”\n\n    Proler provided the following testimony regarding his behavior during the March\n    2006 fire. While en route to the fire, Proler attempted to grab his equipment but his\n    hand “didn’t necessarily cooperate. I’d miss it. I’d miss by several inches. . . . And I\n    knew something was clearly wrong at that time.” After arriving at the scene and\n    receiving orders, “it was obvious to [Proler] something was unusual, because [he] was\n    having difficulty walking and doing stuff that [he] would normally consider routine.”\n    “Eventually somebody . . . grabbed [Proler] by [his] left arm and physically took\n    [him] to the house next door, and sat [him] on a 5-gallon bucket that was turned\n    upside down. And from . . . sitting on that 5-gallon bucket to talking here today, . . .\n    everything has been normal.”8\n\n    Chief Trevino made the decision to transfer Proler to the academy in March 2006 and\n    deny his requests for a transfer back to a suppression unit. According to Chief\n    Trevino, he made these decisions based on letters written by Chief Seamans and\n\n\n        7\n            We emphasize those portions of the instructions pertinent to our sufficiency analysis.\n        8\n          During cross-examination, the City impeached Proler’s trial testimony regarding his recollection\nof the March 2006 fire. The City presented Proler’s deposition testimony that he was in and out of\nconsciousness during the incident. In response to the impeachment, Proler admitted he is unable to testify\nregarding what transpired during “several seconds” at the fire scene; however, Proler also testified that he\nnever lost consciousness and was referring to physical abnormalities when he mentioned “consciousness”\nduring his deposition. It was within the province of the jury to determine what portions, if any, of\nProler’s testimony to believe.\n\n                                                       7\n\fCaptain Johnson, in addition to Chief Trevino’s past experience regarding Proler’s\nreputation for being “scared to go into fires.”\nIn his letter, Captain Johnson explained that during the March 2006 fire, Proler (1) left\nhis uniform open despite repeated orders to dress properly, (2) responded he\nunderstood orders but failed to complete any assignments, (3) did not supervise or\ndirect his firefighters, and (4) stood in the center of a smoke-filled room as if “in\nshock.” Captain Johnson noted that he realized Proler was “not functioning\nrationally” and “there could possibly be something medically wrong with him.”\nCaptain Johnson also noted medics determined Proler had low blood pressure.\nFinally, Captain Johnson opined Proler “could not function at all” for one of two\nreasons: “Either he was scared . . . or there was an acute medical emergency that\nconsumed him.”\nIn his letter, Chief Seamans acknowledged receipt of Captain Johnson’s letter and\nadded the following information regarding Proler’s behavior and condition during the\nMarch 2006 fire: (1) Proler seemed disoriented and could not follow or give orders;\n(2) Proler would nod in affirmation when given orders, but then murmur to himself\nand make “motions that were not sensible, such as fiddling with a redline nozzle that\nhad been laid upon the ground for exposure protection”; (3) an HFD chief present at\nthe time told Johnson “that something was not right” with Proler; (4) Proler was “very\npale and appeared to be weak and wobbly”; (5) Proler had low blood pressure and\npossibly low blood sugar; and (6) Proler’s diagnosis at the hospital might have been\n“slight stroke and/or other acute medical condition.” Chief Seamans requested a “full\ninvestigation and evaluation” and stated, “If [Proler] has some type of medical or\npsychiatric condition that precludes his safe behavior at fire or other emergency\nscenes, then he should be removed from emergency response work until such time as\nthe situation is resolved.” Chief Seamans also detailed Proler’s past and present\nreputation for having a fear of firefighting and disclosed that other firefighters have\nsaid Proler’s “head goes out on him” when faced with severe fire-suppression\nconditions.\nChief Trevino testified that based on the information contained in these letters, he had\nsafety concerns because Proler had been unable to dress properly, respond to simple\norders, or lead his firefighters. Chief Trevino interpreted Chief Seaman’s request as\nasking “for [HFD] to get to the bottom of what happened out at the fire scene; what’s\nat issue with Captain Proler.” Chief Trevino testified that he transferred Proler “until\nwe could sort things out as far as what difficulties he was . . . dealing with.”\nAccording to Chief Trevino, he told Proler that he would be transferred until further\nnotice because Chief Trevino “needed to talk to some other people . . . to see what we\nwere going to do about it.”\nAfter Proler was evaluated at the scene of the March 2006 fire, he was brought by\nambulance to a hospital where he remained for several days. Shortly thereafter, HFD\nreceived a document in which a doctor indicated that Proler had suffered an episode\n\n                                          8\n\f   of global transient amnesia. The doctor released Proler to “full duty” beginning April\n   1, 2006.\n   Chief Boriskie testified that HFD requested a medical evaluation of Proler and was\n   informed he had suffered an episode of global transient amnesia. HFD sent a letter to\n   James Ferrendelli, M.D., requesting clarification regarding whether Proler would\n   suffer a recurrence of amnesia and whether he could safely perform the duties of an\n   HFD captain. Enclosed with HFD’s letter was a document detailing Proler’s job\n   description. Both Chief Boriskie and Chief Trevino testified that Dr. Ferrendelli\n   failed to clarify these issues in his subsequent response.\n   Following the March 2006 fire, Proler was not allowed to transfer from the academy\n   for thirteen months, at which time HFD transferred him to a suppression unit pursuant\n   to the hearing examiner’s award. While Proler was stationed at the academy, HFD\n   never required him to submit to a medical examination.\n\n   According to Proler, at the time of trial, he had been working in a fire suppression unit\n   for between one and two years and had not suffered any similar amnesia episodes\n   during that time. Proler also testified that he is unaware of “any medical, physical or\n   mental condition [he has]” that creates a safety issue for him or his firefighters.\n\n       Considering these facts in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, we\nconclude the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the verdict. As noted\nabove, the jury was charged that it could find the City regarded Proler as having a\nsubstantially limiting impairment if Proler “[1] does not have an impairment at all, [2] but\nis regarded by the employer as having such a substantially limiting impairment.”\n\n       Regarding the first part of this definition, Proler testified he had not suffered\namnesia since being transferred to a suppression unit over one year before trial and does\nnot have any medical condition that poses a safety concern to him or his firefighters.\nAdditionally, the emergency-room doctor who treated Proler following the March 2006\nfire released Proler to full-duty action beginning April 1, 2006. This evidence is legally\nsufficient to support the jury’s finding Proler does not, in actuality, suffer from an\nimpairment. Moreover, this evidence is not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of\nthe evidence as to render the jury’s finding clearly wrong and unjust. In sum, the jury\ncould have reasonably found that Proler’s episode of amnesia was an isolated incident—\nnot a substantially limiting impairment.\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       We also conclude the evidence supports the jury’s finding regarding the second\npart of the “regarded-as” definition—did the City regard Proler as having a substantially\nlimiting impairment? During the March 2006 fire, Proler was unable to follow orders or\ndress properly, and he muttered, wobbled, and stood in a smoke-filled room, appearing to\nbe in a state of “shock.”       Captain Johnson opined that Proler was unaware of his\nsurroundings and “could not function at all.” Proler also engaged in nonsensical actions,\nsuch as “fiddling” with a nozzle.       Several individuals opined that something was\nmedically wrong with Proler, and he was later diagnosed as having suffered global\ntransient amnesia. In the past, other firefighters had complained that Proler’s “head goes\nout on him” when he faces severe fire conditions. After receiving a medical report in\nwhich Proler was cleared to return to full-duty action, HFD asked Dr. Ferrendelli to\nclarify whether Proler would suffer amnesia in the future and whether he could continue\nto perform as an HFD captain. According to Chief Boriskie and Chief Trevino, Dr.\nFerrendelli’s response was unsatisfactory. However, instead of sending Proler to a doctor\nfor further evaluation, HFD refused to transfer Proler from the academy for thirteen\nmonths, at which time HFD acquiesced to the hearing examiner’s award and transferred\nProler to a suppression unit.\n\n       When determining whether the employer regarded the plaintiff as disabled, we\nmust consider the employer’s state of mind at the time the alleged discrimination\noccurred; this determination is predicated on the specific facts of each case and usually\nmust be proved by circumstantial evidence.

We conclude the evidence supports a finding the City regarded\nProler as having a recurring physiological or mental impairment that caused him to suffer\nepisodes during which his cognitive ability was diminished to the point he was unaware\nof his surroundings for at least several minutes. Axiomatically, the average person in the\ngeneral population does not suffer similar episodes.       Hence, the jury could have\nreasonably found that the City regarded Proler as significantly restricted relative to the\ncondition, manner, or duration under which he was able to perform the major life activity\n\n\n                                            10\n\fof “thinking” compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average\nperson in the general population is able to “think.” See Taylor v.

Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118470\"><a href=\"/opinion/118470/toyota-motor-mfg-ky-inc-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196–97 (2002). The Supreme Court defined “substantially\nlimited” as “an impairment that prevents or severely restricts.” Id. In this context, “severe” means “of a\ngreat degree.” Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1078 (9th ed. 1991). However, in Proler’s\njury charge, “substantially limited” was defined as something that “significantly restricts.” “Significant”\nmeans “of a noticeably or measurably large amount.” Id. at 1096. Based on these definitions, it is easier\nfor a party to establish a “significant restriction” than a “severe restriction.” We hold that the jury could\nhave reasonably determined the City regarded Proler as restricted by “a noticeably large amount” in his\nability to “think” compared to the average person’s ability to “think.” We cannot conclude it was\nunreasonable for the jury to determine that an inability to “think,” even if intermittent, was a significant\nrestriction.\n        10\n           We disagree with our dissenting colleague that reasonable and fair-minded jurors could not\nconclude the City regarded Proler as suffering from a substantially limiting impairment as defined in the\njury charge. Despite receiving an inadequate response from Dr. Ferrendelli regarding Proler’s medical\ncondition, the City retained Proler at the academy for over a year without requiring him to undergo\nadditional medical testing. This evidence supports a finding the City believed that, at any moment, Proler\nmight suffer a debilitating episode during which he is unable to the “think” normally. The jury could\nhave reasonably determined that HFD (1) would not have requested additional information from Dr.\nFerrendelli if HFD had transferred Proler solely because of his fear of firefighting or (2) would have\nordered additional medical testing if HPD were unsure whether Proler’s condition was merely a\ntemporary, singular occurrence.\n        We also note that under the definition of “motivating factor” in the jury charge, the City\ncommitted employment discrimination if it decided to transfer Proler because he was afraid of fire\nsuppression and suffered from a disability. Thus, evidence supporting a finding that Proler’s supervisors\nconsidered him to be afraid of firefighting is not detrimental to the jury’s finding.\n\n                                                     11\n\f       We also conclude the evidence is factually sufficient to support the jury’s verdict.\nAdmittedly, the evidence supports a finding that the City transferred Proler because it\nbelieved he feared firefighting and was unfit to supervise a suppression unit, not because\nhe was disabled. Nevertheless, as described above, there is also evidence supporting a\nfinding that the City regarded Proler as having a recurring disability. In their letters,\nCaptain Johnson and Chief Seamans explained that Proler may have been suffering from\nan acute medical condition. Chief Trevino testified that he retained Proler at the academy\nbecause Chief Trevino was unsure of the nature of Proler’s condition. Further, in HFD’s\nletter to Dr. Ferrendelli, HFD recognized Proler had been diagnosed as having suffered\nglobal transient amnesia and released to full-duty work, but inquired whether Proler\nwould suffer a relapse and whether he could safely perform the functions of a fire-\nsuppression captain. After receiving an unsatisfactory response from Dr. Ferrendelli,\nHFD did not conduct further medical inquiry into Proler’s condition and refused to\ntransfer him from the academy.          Chief Trevino admitted he never received any\ninformation indicating that Proler was unable to discharge his duties as captain. This\nevidence supports a finding that the City regarded Proler as suffering from recurring\nepisodes during which he was unable to “think.” This finding is not so contrary to the\noverwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. See Cain, 709\nS.W.2d at 176.\n\n       Accordingly, we conclude the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to\nsupport the jury’s verdict and overrule Proler’s first issue.\n\n                                    III. JURY CHARGE\n\n       In its second issue, the City contends the trial court erred by refusing to submit the\nCity’s proffered instructions in the jury charge.\n\nA.

When a trial court refuses to submit a requested instruction, the relevant\nquestion on appeal is whether the requested instruction was reasonably necessary to\nenable the jury to render a proper verdict.

The trial court has great latitude and\nconsiderable discretion to determine the necessary and proper jury instructions, and any\nerror regarding a requested instruction will not be reversed unless it probably caused\nrendition of an improper judgment. Louisiana–Pacific Corp. v. Knighten, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2460566\"><a href=\"/opinion/2460566/louisiana-pacific-corp-v-knighten/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 676 (Tex. 1998).\n\nB. Analysis\n\n       The City complains regarding the trial court’s refusal to submit two instructions.\nFirst, the City offered the following expanded definition of “substantially limits” as\napplied to the major life activity of working; the italicized sentences are those added by\nthe City:\n\n       “Substantially limits” (as applied to the major life activity[] of “working”)\n       means that an individual is restricted in the ability to perform either a class\n       of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the\n       average person having comparable training, skills, and abilities. To be\n       substantially limited in the major life activity of working, then, one must be\n       precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular\n       job choice. The impairment must substantially limit employment generally.\n       The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a\n       substantial limitation in the major life activity of working. A physical or\n       mental impairment that affects the claimant’s ability to engage in a narrow\n       range of jobs only or a particular job alone does not “substantially limit”\n       one or more major life activities.\n\n(citations omitted, emphasis added).\n\n       Second, the City submitted the following instruction regarding “temporariness”:\n\n       Merely having an impairment does not make one disabled for purposes of\n       the discrimination laws. In order to prevail, Proler must have shown that\n       [HFD] treated him as if he had a substantially limiting impairment. To be\n       considered a disability, the impairments [sic] impact must be permanent or\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f        long-term. Temporary, non-chronic impairments of short duration, with\n        little or no permanent long-term impact are not disabilities.\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n        We hold that the trial court did not err by refusing the City’s requested definition\nfor “substantially limits” as applied to “working.” The additional sentences merely\nreiterate the other sentences in instruction (which were submitted to the jury), namely,\nthat an impairment substantially limits Proler’s ability to work only if the impairment\nrestricts his ability to perform a wide range of jobs.              The trial court acted within its\ndiscretion by refusing this definition.11\n\n        Regarding the “temporariness” instruction, we agree that an impairment must\ngenerally be permanent or long-term, not merely temporary, to qualify as a disability\nunder the ADA and TCHRA.                  See, e.g., Columbia Plaza Med. Ctr. of Fort Worth\nSubsidiary, L.P. v. Szurek, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1634955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1634955/columbia-plaza-med-center-etc-v-szurek/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166–68 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003, pet.\ndenied) (“An impairment simply cannot be a substantial limitation on a major life activity\nif it is expected to improve in a relatively short period of time.”); see also 29 C.F.R. pt.\n1630, app. § 1630.2(j) (2010 version) (“[T]emporary, non-chronic impairments of short\nduration, with little or no long term or permanent impact, are usually not disabilities.”).\nWe also recognize Proler testified his amnesia was an isolated occurrence and that, days\nafter the incident, a physician cleared Proler for return to full-duty work. These facts\nstrongly support a finding that Proler suffered a temporary impairment on the day of the\nfire. However, Proler’s theory of liability was not whether he was actually disabled but\nwhether the City regarded him as disabled. It is undisputed the City refused to transfer\nProler from the academy for more than a year, at which time the City transferred Proler\nonly because of the hearing examiner’s order. These facts strongly support a finding that\nthe City did not regard Proler’s impairment as temporary, but permanent and recurring.12\n\n        11\n          We also note that Proler argued to the jury the major life activity of working was inapplicable\nand should not be considered. Accordingly, even if the court erred by refusing the City’s definition, such\nerror was harmless.\n        12\n             During closing statements, Proler argued,\n\n                                                     14\n\fThus, we hold that the trial court’s refusal to submit the instruction, even if erroneous, did\nnot probably cause rendition of an improper judgment.                  The City’s second issue is\noverruled.\n\n                                    IV. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\n       We next address the City’s fourth issue, in which the City contends the trial court\nerred by granting Proler’s request for an injunction because no evidence supported such\nrelief. The trial court awarded the following injunctive relief:\n\n       In accordance with the jury’s verdict that the City acted with respect to\n       [Proler] in violation of state and federal law proscribing employment\n       discrimination on account of perceived disability, and evidence from which\n       the court finds that Proler and individuals similarly situated should be\n       protected from future unlawful conduct, it is\n              ORDERED that the City of Houston shall not in any manner further\n       discriminate against [Proler] or retaliate against [Proler] because of his\n       claims of discrimination, the presentation of the grievance related thereto,\n       and the filing of his counterclaim.\n             ORDERED that the City of Houston shall not discriminate in its\n       assignments of [Proler] because of any perceived physical or mental\n       impairment without utilizing the proceedings required by Tex. Loc. Gov’t\n       Code § 143.1115(a).\n\n       Under section 21.258 of the Labor Code, “On finding that a respondent engaged in\nan unlawful employment practice as alleged in a complaint, a court may: (1) prohibit by\ninjunction the respondent from engaging in an unlawful employment practice; and (2)\norder additional equitable relief as may be appropriate.”                 Tex. Lab. Code Ann. §\n21.258(a) (West 2006). The injunctive relief afforded under this statute results in a\npermanent injunction because the statute requires a finding on the ultimate issue in an\nemployment-discrimination case. San Antonio Water Sys. v. Odem, No. 04-07-00130-\n\n       Well, the City and [HFD] would say: [Proler was incapacitated for] maybe just one\n       incident. Maybe he was - - he could be considered disabled at that particular point and\n       for those days, but that would not have anything to do over a long period of time. Well,\n       how can they assert that and argue that, if for more than one year Chief Trevino would\n       not let him get out of the assignment to a training academy, because of the information he\n       had received which, as I have shown you, very specifically met the test of a disability?\n\n                                                  15\n\fCV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2376147</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (Tex.

In Johnson, the court\nof appeals held that an injunction may be granted under section 65.011(1) of the Civil\nPractice and Remedies Code without demonstrating irreparable injury. Id. at 110. Under\nsection 65.011(1), “A writ of injunction may be granted if . . . the applicant is entitled to\nthe relief demanded and all or part of the relief requires the restraint of some act\nprejudicial to the applicant.”         Id. (quoting Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. §\n65.011(1)). In a per curiam opinion denying the appellant’s petition for review, the\nSupreme Court of Texas concluded, “[T]he statute does not permit injunctive relief\nwithout the showing of irreparable harm otherwise required by equity. If it did, the\nstatutory remedy would simply replace the equitable [right to injunctive relief], which\nrequires the additional showing.”            Id. at 111; see also Kendall Appraisal Dist. v.\nCordillera Ranch, Ltd., No. 04-03-00150-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">21696901</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2–3 (Tex.

In its appellate brief, the\nCity cites Texas cases for the proposition that applicants for statutory injunctive relief must prove\nirreparable injury and no adequate remedy at law; the City does not cite any Texas or federal cases\ninvolving the requirements for obtaining federal statutory injunctive relief. The City concludes the\nargument section of this issue by contending, “Plaintiff has not [established he is] currently suffering an\nirreparable injury as a result of any alleged violation of the ADA or the TCHRA.” We conclude the City\nwaived any argument that the trial court erred by issuing the injunction based on the federal provision\nbecause the City did not support this argument with citation to any authorities.

The City contends that in addition to section\n21.258, Proler sought injunctive relief pursuant to section 143.1115 of the Local\nGovernment Code. Section 143.1115 governs the procedure the City must apply when\ndetermining whether a firefighter is “sufficiently physically or mentally fit to continue the\nperson’s duties or assignment.” Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Ann. § 143.1115 (West 2008). As\nnoted above, when granting injunctive relief, the trial court ordered the City to refrain\nfrom discriminating against Proler because of any perceived physical or mental\nimpairment without utilizing the procedure required under section 143.1115(a). The\nevidence supports a finding that the City failed to comply with this procedure in\ndetermining Proler was physically and mentally unfit to continue in fire suppression,\ninstead treating Proler as disabled without medical evidence establishing such disability.\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not grant injunctive relief pursuant to section\n\n\nbefore eBay, some federal courts required proof of these elements before issuance of an injunction under\nthe counterpart provision.

Analysis\n\n       As an initial matter, Proler argues the City is barred from challenging the trial\ncourt’s ruling on Proler’s plea to the jurisdiction. Specifically, Proler notes that, after the\ntrial court granted Proler’s plea, the City appealed the interlocutory order to our court.\nCity of Houston v. Proler, 14-08-00110-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2574360</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] June 26, 2008, no pet.) (mem. op.) (per curiam). After Proler filed a\n\n                                              21\n\fmotion to dismiss for want of prosecution, the City voluntarily filed its own motion to\ndismiss, which our court granted. Id. Proler contends the City is barred from seeking\nappellate review of the trial court’s order because our court already dismissed an\ninterlocutory appeal of the order. We disagree.\n\n       Although we ultimately dismissed the City’s prior interlocutory appeal based on\nthe City’s own motion, there was no authority whereby the City was permitted to file that\nappeal. Generally, a party may appeal only a final judgment. See Lehmann v. Har-Con\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1947466\"><a href=\"/opinion/1947466/lehmann-v-har-con-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195 (Tex. 2001). However, a party may appeal an interlocutory\norder in which the trial court “grants or denies a plea to the jurisdiction by a\ngovernmental unit.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 51.014(a)(8) (West Supp.\n2011) (emphasis added). Under this provision, an interlocutory appeal is not available if\nthe plea to the jurisdiction was not made by a governmental unit. Baylor Coll. of Med. v.\nHernandez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1762619\"><a href=\"/opinion/1762619/baylor-college-of-medicine-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7–8 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied).\n\n       Here, the plea to the jurisdiction was made by Proler, not a governmental unit.\nThus, the City did not have a right to interlocutory appeal and has not yet had an\nopportunity to seek review of the trial court’s order granting Proler’s plea. Thus, we will\naddress the merits of City’s fifth issue.\n\n       The City contends that it pleaded sufficient facts to establish the trial court’s\njurisdiction under section 143.1016(j). A hearing examiner’s award is appealable to a\ndistrict court only on grounds the examiner “was without jurisdiction or exceeded [his]\njurisdiction or that the order was procured by fraud, collusion, or other unlawful means.”\nTex. Loc. Gov’t Code Ann. § 143.1016. A hearing examiner exceeds his jurisdiction\nwhen his acts are not authorized by the Fire Fighters and Police Officers Civil Service\nAct16 or are contrary to the Act, or invade the policy-setting realm protected by the\nnondelegation doctrine.

The Hearing\nExaminer awarded monetary relief to Proler in the form of overtime compensation when\nit was admitted or there was no evidence that he had ever worked any overtime.”\nNotably, the City also asserted, the Hearing Examiner “exceeded any jurisdiction he did\nhave by making this particular ruling,” and “[The City] respectfully requests a declaration\nthat the Third-Party Hearing Examiner exceeded his jurisdiction and abused his lawful\nauthority when he granted Captain Proler’s transfer, and overturned the Fire Chief’s\ndenial of transfer as well as allowing for the recovery of moneys for work that was never\nperformed.”\n\n       On appeal, the City argues it properly pleaded that the hearing examiner exceeded\nhis jurisdiction by awarding Proler overtime pay for hours he did not work. We agree.\nThe City satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of section 143.1016(j), and\naffirmatively demonstrated the trial court’s jurisdiction, by alleging that the hearing\nexaminer exceeded his jurisdiction when he awarded unearned overtime compensation.17\nThe City does not challenge any other portion of the trial court’s order granting Proler’s\nplea. Thus, we reverse the trial court’s order dismissing the City’s appeal to the extent\nthe City claims the hearing examiner exceeded his jurisdiction by awarding overtime\ncompensation and requests declaratory relief relative to this issue.18 We affirm the\nremainder of the order. The City’s fifth issue is sustained.\n\n\n\n\n       17\n            We make no determination regarding whether the hearing examiner actually exceeded his\njurisdiction, i.e., the merits of the City’s claim.\n       18\n          A trial court has jurisdiction to make a declaration regarding whether a hearing examiner\nexceeded his jurisdiction when the court also has jurisdiction under section 143.1016(j).

ATTORNEY’S FEES\n\n       Finally, we address the City’s third issue, in which it contends the trial court erred\nby awarding attorney’s fees in an amount disproportionate to the jury’s determination of\n$0.00 in actual damages. The trial court awarded fees as follows:\n\n       ORDERED that the City of Houston pay to [Proler] and his attorney, David\n       T. López, as attorney’s fees related to the City’s declaratory judgment\n       action, the sum of Sixty-seven Thousand, One Hundred and Sixty Dollars\n       ($67,160.00): pay to [Proler] and his attorney David T. López, as attorney’s\n       fees related to Proler’s claim of unlawful employment discrimination, the\n       sum of $361,700.00/00 and the costs of this action in the sum of\n       $17,182.34, all with interest thereon at the rate of Five Percent (5%) per\n       annum from the date of the judgment.\n\n       We first address the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees relative to the City’s\ndeclaratory-judgment action. As explained above, we have reversed the portion of the\ntrial court’s order dismissing the City’s claim that the hearing examiner exceeded his\njurisdiction by awarding Proler overtime compensation, including the City’s request for\ndeclaratory relief. Because the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees relative to the City’s\ndeclaratory-judgment action was likely predicated on erroneous dismissal of the action,\nwe reverse the portion of the trial court’s judgment awarding Proler attorney’s fees\nrelative to the City’s declaratory-judgment action.

Proler then cited a case\nin which the lodestar method was used21 and presented argument regarding lodestar\nfactors.\n\n         We cannot determine from the record what method the trial court utilized in\ndetermining the reasonable amount of attorney’s fees.

It is unnecessary to elaborate on this caselaw because we limit\nour review to the reasonableness of fees awarded under Texas law, section 21.259, and thus need not\nfollow federal precedent. See footnote 24, infra.\n        24\n           Generally, when a trial court uses the lodestar method to determine the amount of an attorney’s\nfees award, the court must file findings of fact and conclusions of law detailing how it calculated fees.\nSee In re High Sulfur Content Gasoline Prods.

R. Civ. P. 42(h), (i) (requiring trial courts to utilize lodestar method when determining fees in a\nclass-action suit and to make findings of fact pertaining to the fees calculation). By reviewing the\nfindings, the appellate court may “determine whether the [trial] court has used proper factual criteria in\nexercising its discretion to fix just compensation.” In re High Sulfur, 517 F.3d at 228 (citation omitted).\n        In the present case, the trial court did not file, and the record does not reflect that either party\n                                                    26\n\f        The City has not challenged the reasonableness of López’s rate of $400.00 per\nhour. In fact, the City agrees that López is a board certified labor attorney, “well known\nin the employment law community.”                   Thus, the trial court could have properly\ndetermined that $400.00 per hour was a reasonable rate in this case.\n\n        In his affidavit regarding fees and invoices, López segregated his fees pertaining\nto the City’s suit for declaratory relief from fees pertaining to Proler’s employment-\ndiscrimination claim. López’s invoices reflect that from March 2006 to March 2010, he\nprovided 1,205.9 hours of legal services pertaining to the employment-discrimination\nclaim. The City complains that the trial court awarded nearly $60,000.00 in fees for legal\nservices provided before the City filed its claim for declaratory judgment on May 18,\n2007; however, the City does not cite any authority supporting its contention that fees\nincurred before commencement of litigation are unrecoverable. The City also argues\nProler filed excessive motions in an attempt to inflate his fees, including “the infamous\nrefiling of a motion for summary judgment that did not allege or argue any new issues”;\nhowever, the City does specifically cite any unnecessary filings listed in López’s\ninvoices.\n\n        Additionally, the City argues that the amount of fees awarded is disproportionate\nto the relative success of Proler’s employment-discrimination claim because the issues\ninvolved were simple, necessitated only two jury questions, and did not require expert\ntestimony. The City further notes that Proler presented minimal evidence regarding\ndamages, was awarded no damages, and ultimately received an injunction which he could\nhave pursued early in the litigation.\n\n\n\nrequested, findings. However, there is no binding Texas law requiring a trial court to file findings of fact\nwhen it uses the lodestar method to calculate fees under section 21.259. Further, the City does not argue\nProler should have segregated his ADA fees from his TCHRA fees. Therefore, we consider whether the\nfees were reasonable under section 21.259 and presume the trial court made all findings necessary to\nsupport its award. See Sixth RMA Partners, L.P. v.

Assuming that the trial court\naccepted Proler’s lodestar amount, the court apparently reduced the amount by 25%\nbecause it awarded $361,770.00 in fees, which is exactly a 25% reduction of\n$482,360.00.\n\n       The trial court could have reasonably disagreed with the City’s contention that\nProler should have sought injunctive relief early in the lawsuit and, thus, he must have\nextended the litigation in an effort to inflate fees. First, the trial court, as manager of this\ncase’s docket, was in a unique position to determine whether Proler purposefully\nextended the litigation over a four-year period and made unnecessary filings or whether\n(as Proler claims) the City’s lack of cooperation necessitated increased costs.

See Tex. Lab.\nCode Ann. § 21.258. Thus, in order to obtain injunctive relief, Proler was required to\ndiscover and present evidence establishing that the City had committed employment\ndiscrimination. Further, the record supports a finding that Proler’s primary purpose in\ncountersuing the City was to obtain an injunction preventing future discrimination; Proler\npresented little evidence regarding damages but testified that he greatly desired to remain\nin fire suppression. Accordingly, it was within the trial court’s discretion to decrease the\nlodestar amount based on the lack of monetary damages but still award a substantial\n\n                                              28\n\famount of fees for López’s services in obtaining the requested injunctive relief.
