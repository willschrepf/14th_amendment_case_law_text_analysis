After G.G. began to use the boys’ restrooms\n\nwith the approval of the school administration, the local school\n\nboard   passed     a     policy       banning       G.G.   from   the    boys’         restroom.\n\nG.G. alleges that the school board impermissibly discriminated\n\nagainst him in violation of Title IX and the Equal Protection\n\nClause of the Constitution.                   The district court dismissed G.G.’s\n\nTitle     IX    claim     and        denied    his     request     for       a    preliminary\n\ninjunction.        This        appeal    followed.         Because      we       conclude     the\n\ndistrict       court    did     not     accord       appropriate     deference           to   the\n\nrelevant       Department       of    Education       regulations,       we       reverse     its\n\ndismissal of G.G.’s Title IX claim.                        Because we conclude that\n\nthe   district         court    used     the     wrong     evidentiary           standard      in\n\nassessing G.G.’s motion for a preliminary injunction, we vacate\n\nits   denial      and     remand       for     consideration       under         the    correct\n\nstandard.        We therefore reverse in part, vacate in part, and\n\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n                                               I.\n\n      At the heart of this appeal is whether Title IX requires\n\nschools    to    provide        transgender          students     access         to    restrooms\n\ncongruent with their gender identity.                       Title IX provides: “[n]o\n\n\n                                                5\n\fperson    .    .     .    shall,    on    the    basis      of    sex,       be    excluded        from\n\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n\ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving\n\nFederal       financial         assistance.”           20    U.S.C.          §    1681(a).          The\n\nDepartment           of        Education’s        (the       Department)               regulations\n\nimplementing Title IX permit the provision of “separate toilet,\n\nlocker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such\n\nfacilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable\n\nto such facilities for students of the other sex.”                                     34 C.F.R. §\n\n106.33.        In        an    opinion    letter      dated       January         7,    2015,       the\n\nDepartment’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) interpreted how this\n\nregulation         should       apply     to    transgender           individuals:           “When   a\n\nschool elects to separate or treat students differently on the\n\nbasis of sex . . . a school generally must treat transgender\n\nstudents       consistent          with    their      gender      identity.”                J.A.   55.\n\nBecause       this       case    comes     to    us   after       dismissal         pursuant         to\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the facts below are\n\ngenerally as stated in G.G.’s complaint.\n\n\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       G.G.     is       a    transgender       boy    now       in    his       junior     year     at\n\nGloucester High School.                  G.G.’s birth-assigned sex, or so-called\n\n“biological sex,” is female, but G.G.’s gender identity is male.\n\nG.G.     has    been          diagnosed    with       gender          dysphoria,        a    medical\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fcondition      characterized   by    clinically       significant     distress\n\ncaused by an incongruence between a person’s gender identity and\n\nthe person’s birth-assigned sex.           Since the end of his freshman\n\nyear, G.G. has undergone hormone therapy and has legally changed\n\nhis name to G., a traditionally male name.                   G.G. lives all\n\naspects of his life as a boy.             G.G. has not, however, had sex\n\nreassignment surgery. 1\n\n     Before beginning his sophomore year, G.G. and his mother\n\ntold school officials that G.G. was a transgender boy.                     The\n\nofficials were supportive and took steps to ensure that he would\n\nbe treated as a boy by teachers and staff.                  Later, at G.G.’s\n\nrequest,      school   officials    allowed    G.G.    to    use    the   boys’\n\nrestroom. 2     G.G. used this restroom without incident for about\n\nseven weeks.      G.G.’s use of the boys’ restroom, however, excited\n\nthe interest of others in the community, some of whom contacted\n\n\n\n\n     1 The World Professional Association for Transgender Health\n(WPATH) has established Standards of Care for individuals with\ngender dysphoria.    J.A. 37.     These Standards of Care are\naccepted as authoritative by organizations such as the American\nMedical Association and the American Psychological Association.\nId. The WPATH Standards of Care do not permit sex reassignment\nsurgery for persons who are under the legal age of majority.\nJ.A. 38.\n\n     2  G.G. does not participate in the school’s physical\neducation programs. He does not seek here, and never has sought,\nuse of the boys’ locker room. Only restroom use is at issue in\nthis case.\n\n\n\n                                      7\n\fthe Gloucester County School Board (the Board) seeking to bar\n\nG.G. from continuing to use the boys’ restroom.\n\n      Board Member Carla B. Hook (Hook) added an item to the\n\nagenda     for   the    November    11,     2014     board    meeting        titled\n\n“Discussion of Use of Restrooms/Locker Room Facilities.”                      J.A.\n\n15.      Hook proposed the following resolution (hereinafter the\n\n“transgender restroom policy” or “the policy”):\n\n            Whereas the GCPS [i.e., Gloucester County\n            Public   Schools]  recognizes  that   some\n            students question their gender identities,\n            and\n\n            Whereas the GCPS encourages such students to\n            seek support, advice, and guidance from\n            parents, professionals and other trusted\n            adults, and\n\n            Whereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe\n            learning environment for all students and to\n            protect   the  privacy   of   all  students,\n            therefore\n\n            It shall be the practice of the GCPS to\n            provide male and female restroom and locker\n            room facilities in its schools, and the use\n            of said facilities shall be limited to the\n            corresponding    biological    genders,    and\n            students with gender identity issues shall\n            be   provided   an   alternative   appropriate\n            private facility.\n\nJ.A. 15-16; 58.\n\n      At the November 11, 2014 meeting twenty-seven people spoke\n\nduring    the    Citizens’   Comment       Period,    a   majority      of    whom\n\nsupported    Hook’s    proposed    resolution.       Many    of   the   speakers\n\ndisplayed hostility to G.G., including by referring pointedly to\n\n\n                                       8\n\fhim as a “young lady.”        J.A. 16.         Others claimed that permitting\n\nG.G. to use the boys’ restroom would violate the privacy of\n\nother students and would lead to sexual assault in restrooms.\n\nOne commenter suggested that if the proposed policy were not\n\nadopted,    non-transgender        boys   would     come      to   school   wearing\n\ndresses in order to gain access to the girls’ restrooms.                      G.G.\n\nand his parents spoke against the proposed policy.                     Ultimately,\n\nthe Board postponed a vote on the policy until its next meeting\n\non December 9, 2014.\n\n     At     the   December    9    meeting,       approximately       thirty-seven\n\npeople spoke during the Citizens’ Comment Period.                     Again, most\n\nof those who spoke were in favor of the proposed resolution.\n\nSome speakers threatened to vote the Board members out of office\n\nif   the    Board   members       voted       against   the    proposed     policy.\n\nSpeakers again referred to G.G. as a “girl” or “young lady.”\n\nJ.A. 18.     One speaker called G.G. a “freak” and compared him to\n\na person who thinks he is a “dog” and wants to urinate on fire\n\nhydrants.     Id.   Following this second comment period, the Board\n\nvoted 6-1 to adopt the proposed policy, thereby barring G.G.\n\nfrom using the boys’ restroom at school.\n\n     G.G. alleges that he cannot use the girls’ restroom because\n\nwomen and girls in those facilities “react[] negatively because\n\nthey perceive[] G.G. to be a boy.”                  Id.       Further, using the\n\ngirls’ restroom would “cause severe psychological distress” to\n\n\n                                          9\n\fG.G. and would be incompatible with his treatment for gender\n\ndysphoria.       J.A. 19.           As a corollary to the policy, the Board\n\nannounced    a    series       of    updates       to    the     school’s    restrooms      to\n\nimprove general privacy for all students, including adding or\n\nexpanding partitions between urinals in male restrooms, adding\n\nprivacy strips to the doors of stalls in all restrooms, and\n\nconstructing       single-stall         unisex          restrooms    available      to     all\n\nstudents.        G.G. alleges that he cannot use these new unisex\n\nrestrooms because they “make him feel even more stigmatized . .\n\n. .   Being required to use the separate restrooms sets him apart\n\nfrom his peers, and serves as a daily reminder that the school\n\nviews him as ‘different.’”                   Id.         G.G. further alleges that,\n\nbecause of this stigma and exclusion, his social transition is\n\nundermined and he experiences “severe and persistent emotional\n\nand social harms.”         Id.       G.G. avoids using the restroom while at\n\nschool   and      has,    as    a     result       of     this    avoidance,       developed\n\nmultiple urinary tract infections.\n\n\n\n                                              B.\n\n      G.G.   sued    the       Board    on    June       11,     2015.      G.G.   seeks    an\n\ninjunction allowing him to use the boys’ restroom and brings\n\nunderlying       claims    that      the     Board       impermissibly       discriminated\n\nagainst him in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments\n\nAct of 1972 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.\n\n\n                                              10\n\fOn July 27, 2015, the district court held a hearing on G.G.’s\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction and on the Board’s motion to\n\ndismiss   G.G.’s     lawsuit.         At    the   hearing,   the   district   court\n\norally dismissed G.G.’s Title IX claim and denied his request\n\nfor a preliminary injunction, but withheld ruling on the motion\n\nto dismiss G.G.’s equal protection claim.                     The district court\n\nfollowed its ruling from the bench with a written order dated\n\nSeptember 4, 2015 denying the injunction and a second written\n\norder dated September 17, 2015 dismissing G.G.’s Title IX claim\n\nand expanding on its rationale for denying the injunction.\n\n     In     its    September      17,      2015   order,     the   district   court\n\nreasoned that Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of\n\nsex and not on the basis of other concepts such as gender,\n\ngender    identity,      or    sexual      orientation.      The   district   court\n\nobserved that the regulations implementing Title IX specifically\n\nallow schools to provide separate restrooms on the basis of sex.\n\nThe district court concluded that G.G.’s sex was female and that\n\nrequiring    him    to   use    the     female    restroom   facilities   did   not\n\nimpermissibly discriminate against him on the basis of sex in\n\nviolation of Title IX.            With respect to G.G.’s request for an\n\ninjunction, the district court found that G.G. had not made the\n\nrequired showing that the balance of equities was in his favor.\n\nThe district court found that requiring G.G. to use the unisex\n\nrestrooms during the pendency of this lawsuit was not unduly\n\n\n                                            11\n\fburdensome     and   would    result   in    less    hardship      than    requiring\n\nother     students   made    uncomfortable     by    G.G.’s       presence    in    the\n\nboys’ restroom to themselves use the unisex restrooms.\n\n      This appeal followed.         G.G. asks us to reverse the district\n\ncourt’s dismissal of his Title IX claim, grant the injunction he\n\nseeks,     and,   because    of   comments    made     by   the    district    judge\n\nduring the motion hearing, to assign the case to a different\n\ndistrict judge on remand.          The Board, on the other hand, asks us\n\nto   affirm   the    district     court’s    rulings    and   also     asks    us    to\n\ndismiss     G.G.’s   equal    protection     claim—on       which    the     district\n\ncourt has yet to rule—as without merit.                 The United States, as\n\nit did below, has filed an amicus brief supporting G.G.’s Title\n\nIX claim in order to defend the government’s interpretation of\n\nTitle IX as requiring schools to provide transgender students\n\naccess to restrooms congruent with their gender identity.\n\n\n\n                                       II.\n\n      We turn first to the district court’s dismissal of G.G.’s\n\nTitle IX claim. 3     We review de novo the district court’s grant of\n\n\n\n\n      3We decline the Board’s invitation to preemptively dismiss\nG.G.’s equal protection claim before it has been fully\nconsidered by the district court. “[W]e are a court of review,\nnot of first view.” Decker v.

For example, Title IX permits the provision of\n\n\n\n           student, a recipient shall not, on the basis\n           of sex:\n\n           (1)   Treat  one  person  differently from\n           another in determining whether such person\n           satisfies any requirement or condition for\n           the provision of such aid, benefit, or\n           service;\n\n           (2) Provide different aid, benefits,        or\n           services   or  provide   aid,   benefits,   or\n           services in a different manner;\n\n           (3) Deny any person any such aid, benefit,\n           or service;\n\n           . . .\n\n           (7) Otherwise limit any person in the\n           enjoyment    of    any   right, privilege,\n           advantage, or opportunity.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b).     We have little difficulty concluding\nthat access to a restroom at a school, under this regulation,\ncan be considered either an “aid, benefit, or service” or a\n“right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity,”      which, when\noffered by a recipient institution, falls within the meaning of\n“educational program” as used in Title IX and defined by the\nDepartment’s implementing regulations.\n\n\n\n                                14\n\fseparate    living      facilities    on      the    basis      of     sex:    “nothing\n\ncontained   [in    Title    IX]    shall     be     construed     to    prohibit       any\n\neducational   institution         receiving       funds   under      this     Act,    from\n\nmaintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.”\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1686.          The Department’s regulations implementing\n\nTitle IX permit the provision of “separate toilet, locker room,\n\nand shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities\n\nprovided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such\n\nfacilities provided for students of the other sex.”                           34 C.F.R.\n\n§ 106.33.         The    Department        recently       delineated          how     this\n\nregulation should be applied to transgender individuals.                             In an\n\nopinion letter dated January 7, 2015, the Department’s Office\n\nfor Civil Rights (OCR) wrote: “When a school elects to separate\n\nor treat students differently on the basis of sex . . . a school\n\ngenerally must treat transgender students consistent with their\n\ngender identity.” 5      J.A. 55.\n\n\n     5 The opinion letter cites to OCR’s December 2014 “Questions\nand Answers on Title IX and Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary\nClasses and Extracurricular Activities.” This document, denoted\na “significant guidance document” per Office of Management and\nBudget regulations, states: “All students, including transgender\nstudents and students who do not conform to sex stereotypes, are\nprotected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX.

Robbins, 519 U.S. 452\n\n(1997).      Auer requires that an agency’s interpretation of its\n\nown ambiguous regulation be given controlling weight unless the\n\ninterpretation     is    plainly     erroneous    or    inconsistent       with    the\n\nregulation or statute.

They must, however, “reflect the agency’s fair and\n\nconsidered judgment on the matter in question.”                     Id. at 462.       An\n\ninterpretation may not be the result of the agency’s fair and\n\nconsidered judgment, and will not be accorded Auer deference,\n\nwhen the interpretation conflicts with a prior interpretation,\n\nwhen   it    appears    that   the   interpretation         is     no   more   than    a\n\n\n\n\navailable    at    http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs\n/faqs-title-ix-single-sex-201412.pdf.\n\n     The dissent suggests that we ignore the part of OCR’s\nopinion letter in which the agency “also encourages schools to\noffer the use of gender-neutral, individual-user facilities to\nany student who does not want to use shared sex-segregated\nfacilities,” as the Board did here.     Post at 66.    However,\nbecause G.G. does want to use shared sex-segregated facilities,\nthe agency’s suggestion regarding students who do not want to\nuse such shared sex-segregated facilities is immaterial to the\nresolution of G.G.’s claim.       Nothing in today’s opinion\nrestricts any school’s ability to provide individual-user\nfacilities.\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\fconvenient litigating position, or when the interpretation is a\n\npost    hoc   rationalization.

The district\n\ncourt    found     the    regulation      to       be    unambiguous      because       “[i]t\n\nclearly allows the School Board to limit bathroom access ‘on the\n\nbasis of sex,’ including birth or biological sex.”                                    G.G. v.\n\nGloucester Cty.

The       district     court     also     found,\n\nalternatively,           that     the     interpretation             advanced      by      the\n\nDepartment        was    clearly    erroneous           and   inconsistent        with     the\n\nregulation.        The district court reasoned that, because “on the\n\nbasis of sex” means, at most, on the basis of sex and gender\n\ntogether, it cannot mean on the basis of gender alone.

However,        the     Department          also\n\nconsiders     §    106.33       itself   to   be    ambiguous        as   to    transgender\n\nstudents because “the regulation is silent on what the phrases\n\n‘students of one sex’ and ‘students of the other sex’ mean in\n\nthe context of transgender students.”                         Id. at 25.

Thus,     our     analysis\n\nbegins       with    a    determination         of     whether    34   C.F.R.      §    106.33\n\ncontains       an    ambiguity.            Section      106.33     permits    schools        to\n\nprovide “separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on\n\nthe basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of\n\none    sex    shall      be    comparable       to   such    facilities      provided        for\n\nstudents of the other sex.”                34 C.F.R. § 106.33.\n\n       “[D]etermining whether a regulation or statute is ambiguous\n\npresents       a     legal      question,       which       we   determine      de      novo.”\n\nHumanoids Grp. v.

Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S.\n\n337    (1997).            The    plainness        or    ambiguity      of    language        is\n\ndetermined by reference to (1) the language itself,                                    (2) the\n\nspecific context in which that language is used, and (3) the\n\nbroader context of the statute or regulation as a whole.                                Id. at\n\n341.\n\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\f       First,      we   have      little    difficulty     concluding   that     the\n\nlanguage itself—“of one sex” and “of the other sex”—refers to\n\nmale and female students.                Second, in the specific context of\n\n§ 106.33, the plain meaning of the regulatory language is best\n\nstated by the United States: “the mere act of providing separate\n\nrestroom facilities for males and females does not violate Title\n\nIX . . . .”        U.S. Br. 22 n.8.         Third, the language “of one sex”\n\nand “of the other sex” appears repeatedly in the broader context\n\nof 34 C.F.R. § 106 Subpart D, titled “Discrimination on the\n\nBasis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Prohibited.” 6\n\nThis repeated formulation indicates two sexes (“one sex” and\n\n“the       other   sex”),   and     the    only    reasonable     reading   of   the\n\nlanguage used throughout the relevant regulatory section is that\n\nit references male and female.                    Read plainly then, § 106.33\n\npermits schools to provide separate toilet, locker room, and\n\nshower       facilities     for    its     male   and    female   students.       By\n\n       6For example, § 106.32(b)(2) provides that “[h]ousing\nprovided . . .   to students of one sex, when compared to that\nprovided to students of the other sex, shall be as a whole:\nproportionate in quantity . . . and [c]omparable in quality and\ncost   to  the  student”;   §  106.37(a)(3)  provides   that an\ninstitution generally cannot “[a]pply any rule . . . concerning\neligibility [for financial assistance] which treats persons of\none sex differently from persons of the other sex with regard to\nmarital or parental status”; and § 106.41(b) provides that\n“where [an institution] operates or sponsors a team in a\nparticular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors\nno such team for members of the other sex . . . members of the\nexcluded sex must be allowed to try-out for the team offered . .\n. .”\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\fimplication,       the     regulation         also     permits      schools      to    exclude\n\nmales from the female facilities and vice-versa.\n\n        Our inquiry is not ended, however, by this straightforward\n\nconclusion.       Although the regulation may refer unambiguously to\n\nmales    and    females,        it    is     silent    as    to   how    a    school    should\n\ndetermine whether a transgender individual is a male or female\n\nfor    the     purpose    of    access        to    sex-segregated           restrooms.        We\n\nconclude that the regulation is susceptible to more than one\n\nplausible reading because it permits both the Board’s reading—\n\ndetermining maleness or femaleness with reference exclusively to\n\ngenitalia—and            the         Department’s           interpretation—determining\n\nmaleness or femaleness with reference to gender identity.                                     Cf.\n\nDickenson-Russell Coal Co. v. Sec’y of Labor, 747 F.3d 251, 258\n\n(4th Cir. 2014) (refusing to afford Auer deference where the\n\nlanguage of the regulation at issue was “not susceptible to more\n\nthan     one    plausible        reading”          (citation      and    quotation        marks\n\nomitted)).       It is not clear to us how the regulation would apply\n\nin a number of situations—even under the Board’s own “biological\n\ngender”      formulation.             For     example,      which       restroom      would     a\n\ntransgender        individual          who      had     undergone        sex-reassignment\n\nsurgery use?

What     about    an\n\nindividual       who     lost    external          genitalia      in    an    accident?       The\n\nDepartment’s interpretation resolves ambiguity by providing that\n\n\n                                               20\n\fin the case of a transgender individual using a sex-segregated\n\nfacility,    the   individual’s       sex     as   male    or    female    is   to   be\n\ngenerally     determined       by   reference       to    the    student’s      gender\n\nidentity.\n\n\n\n                                         C.\n\n       Because we conclude that the regulation is ambiguous as\n\napplied      to     transgender         individuals,            the    Department’s\n\ninterpretation is entitled to Auer deference unless the Board\n\ndemonstrates      that   the   interpretation        is   plainly      erroneous     or\n\ninconsistent with the regulation or statute.

Reg. 30802, 30955\n\n(May 9, 1980).       Two dictionaries from the drafting era inform\n\nour analysis of how the term “sex” was understood at that time.\n\nThe first defines “sex” as “the character of being either male\n\nor female” or “the sum of those anatomical and physiological\n\ndifferences   with    reference    to    which     the      male    and   female   are\n\ndistinguished . . . .”         American College Dictionary 1109 (1970).\n\nThe second defines “sex” as:\n\n           the sum of the morphological, physiological,\n           and   behavioral    peculiarities   of   living\n           beings      that      subserves      biparental\n           reproduction with its concomitant genetic\n           segregation and recombination which underlie\n           most   evolutionary    change,  that   in   its\n           typical dichotomous occurrence is usu[ally]\n           genetically controlled and associated with\n           special   sex    chromosomes,   and   that   is\n           typically    manifested    as   maleness    and\n           femaleness . . . .\n\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary 2081 (1971).\n\n      Although these definitions suggest that the word “sex” was\n\nunderstood at the time the regulation was adopted to connote\n\nmale and female and that maleness and femaleness were determined\n\nprimarily by reference to the factors the district court termed\n\n“biological   sex,”    namely    reproductive         organs,      the    definitions\n\nalso suggest that a hard-and-fast binary division on the basis\n\nof   reproductive    organs—although         useful    in    most    cases—was     not\n\n\n                                        22\n\funiversally         descriptive. 7          The    dictionaries,         therefore,     used\n\nqualifiers such as reference to the “sum of” various factors,\n\n“typical dichotomous occurrence,” and “typically manifested as\n\nmaleness      and    femaleness.”           Section      106.33       assumes    a   student\n\npopulation      composed       of    individuals         of    what    has    traditionally\n\nbeen understood as the usual “dichotomous occurrence” of male\n\nand female where the various indicators of sex all point in the\n\nsame       direction.      It       sheds    little      light      on   how    exactly   to\n\ndetermine the “character of being either male or female” where\n\nthose indicators diverge.                   We conclude that the Department’s\n\ninterpretation of how § 106.33 and its underlying assumptions\n\nshould apply to transgender individuals is not plainly erroneous\n\nor inconsistent with the text of the regulation.                             The regulation\n\nis silent as to which restroom transgender individuals are to\n\nuse when a school elects to provide sex-segregated restrooms,\n\nand the Department’s interpretation, although perhaps not the\n\nintuitive       one,      is        permitted       by        the     varying     physical,\n\npsychological, and social aspects—or, in the words of an older\n\n\n\n\n       7\n       Modern definitions of “sex” also implicitly recognize the\nlimitations of a nonmalleable, binary conception of sex.     For\nexample, Black’s Law Dictionary defines “sex” as “[t]he sum of\nthe peculiarities of structure and function that distinguish a\nmale from a female organism; gender.”     Black’s Law Dictionary\n1583 (10th ed. 2014). The American Heritage Dictionary includes\nin the definition of “sex” “[o]ne’s identity as either female or\nmale.” American Heritage Dictionary 1605 (5th ed. 2011).\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\fdictionary,      “the      morphological,        physiological,          and    behavioral\n\npeculiarities”—included in the term “sex.”\n\n\n\n                                            D.\n\n       Finally,         we      consider         whether           the         Department’s\n\ninterpretation of § 106.33 is the result of the agency’s fair\n\nand considered judgment.            Even a valid interpretation will not\n\nbe   accorded       Auer     deference    where    it     conflicts       with     a    prior\n\ninterpretation, where it appears that the interpretation is no\n\nmore    than    a     convenient     litigating         position,         or    where     the\n\ninterpretation is a post hoc rationalization.                         Christopher, 132\n\nS. Ct. at 2166 (citations omitted).\n\n       Although the Department’s interpretation is novel because\n\nthere    was    no    interpretation       as    to    how    §    106.33       applied    to\n\ntransgender individuals before January 2015, “novelty alone is\n\nno reason to refuse deference” and does not render the current\n\ninterpretation        inconsistent        with    prior      agency      practice.        See\n\nTalk Am., Inc. v. Mich. Bell Tel. Co., 131 S. Ct. 2254, 2263\n\n(2011).     As the United States explains, the issue in this case\n\n“did not arise until recently,” see id., because schools have\n\nonly    recently      begun      citing     §    106.33      as     justification         for\n\nenacting new policies restricting transgender students’ access\n\nto restroom facilities.             The Department contends that “[i]t is\n\nto      those       ‘newfound’      policies          that        [the     Department’s]\n\n\n                                            24\n\finterpretation of the regulation responds.”                      U.S. Br. 29.        We\n\nsee no reason to doubt this explanation.                       See Talk Am., Inc.,\n\n131 S. Ct. at 2264.\n\n     Nor is the interpretation merely a convenient litigating\n\nposition.        The    Department        has     consistently         enforced    this\n\nposition since 2014.        See J.A. 55 n.5 & n.6 (providing examples\n\nof OCR enforcement actions to secure transgender students access\n\nto restrooms congruent with their gender identities).                         Finally,\n\nthis interpretation cannot properly be considered a post hoc\n\nrationalization        because     it     is     in     line   with     the     existing\n\nguidances and regulations of a number of federal agencies—all of\n\nwhich provide that transgender individuals should be permitted\n\naccess   to     the    restroom    that        corresponds      with    their     gender\n\nidentities. 8     U.S. Br. 17 n.5 & n.6 (citing publications by the\n\nOccupational      Safety     and        Health        Administration,     the     Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Housing and\n\n     8 We disagree with the dissent’s suggestion that the result\nwe reach today renders the enforcement of separate restroom\nfacilities impossible because it “would require schools to\nassume   gender    identity   based   on   appearances,   social\nexpectations, or explicit declarations of identity.”     Post at\n65.   Accepting the Board’s position would equally require the\nschool to assume “biological sex” based on “appearances, social\nexpectations, or explicit declarations of [biological sex].”\nCertainly, no one is suggesting mandatory verification of the\n“correct” genitalia before admittance to a restroom.         The\nDepartment’s vision of sex-segregated restrooms which takes\naccount of gender identity presents no greater “impossibility of\nenforcement” problem than does the Board’s “biological gender”\nvision of sex-segregated restrooms.\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\fUrban      Development,   and    the    Office   of   Personnel    Management).\n\nNone of the Christopher grounds for withholding Auer deference\n\nare present in this case.\n\n\n\n                                           E.\n\n      We conclude that the Department’s interpretation of its own\n\nregulation,       §   106.33,   as    it   relates    to   restroom   access    by\n\ntransgender individuals, is entitled to Auer deference and is to\n\nbe accorded controlling weight in this case. 9                 We reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s contrary conclusion and its resultant dismissal\n\nof G.G.’s Title IX claim.\n\n\n\n                                           F.\n\n        In many respects, we are in agreement with the dissent.                We\n\nagree that “sex” should be construed uniformly throughout Title\n\nIX   and    its   implementing       regulations.     We   agree   that   it   has\n\nindeed been commonplace and widely accepted to separate public\n\n\n      9 The Board urges us to reach a contrary conclusion\nregarding the validity of the Department’s interpretation,\nciting Johnston v. Univ. of Pittsburgh of Com. Sys. of Higher\nEduc., 97 F. Supp. 657 (W.D. Pa. 2015).     Although we recognize\nthat the Johnston court confronted a case similar in most\nmaterial facts to the one before us, that court did not consider\nthe Department’s interpretation     of § 106.33.      Because the\nJohnston   court  did   not  grapple   with   the   questions  of\nadministrative law implicated here, we find the Title IX\nanalysis in Johnston to be unpersuasive.\n\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\frestrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities on the basis of\n\nsex.        We   agree    that    “an    individual    has   a    legitimate    and\n\nimportant interest in bodily privacy such that his or her nude\n\nor partially nude body, genitalia, and other private parts” are\n\nnot involuntarily exposed. 10            Post at 56.    It is not apparent to\n\nus, however, that the truth of these propositions undermines the\n\nconclusion we reach regarding the level of deference due to the\n\nDepartment’s interpretation of its own regulations.\n\n       The Supreme Court commands the use of particular analytical\n\nframeworks       when    courts    review    the   actions   of    the   executive\n\nagencies.        G.G. claims that he is entitled to use the boys’\n\nrestroom     pursuant     to     the    Department’s   interpretation      of   its\n\nregulations implementing Title IX.                 We have carefully followed\n\nthe Supreme Court’s guidance in Chevron, Auer, and Christopher\n\nand have determined that the interpretation contained in the OCR\n\nletter is to be accorded controlling weight.                 In a case such as\n\n\n       10\n       We doubt that G.G.’s use of the communal restroom of his\nchoice threatens the type of constitutional abuses present in\nthe cases cited by the dissent. For example, G.G.’s use—or for\nthat matter any individual’s appropriate use—of a restroom will\nnot involve the type of intrusion present in Brannum v. Overton\nCty. Sch. Bd., 516 F.3d 489, 494 (6th Cir. 2008) (involving the\nvideotaping of students dressing and undressing in school locker\nrooms), Beard v. Whitmore Lake Sch. Dist., 402 F.3d 598, 604\n(6th Cir. 2005) (involving the indiscriminate strip searching of\ntwenty male and five female students), or Supelveda v. Ramirez,\n967 F.2d 1413, 1416 (9th Cir. 1992) (involving a male parole\nofficer forcibly entering a bathroom stall with a female parolee\nto supervise the provision of a urine sample).\n\n\n\n                                           27\n\fthis,     where    there    is   no   constitutional    challenge      to   the\n\nregulation    or   agency    interpretation,   the     weighing   of   privacy\n\ninterests or safety concerns 11—fundamentally questions of policy—\n\nis a task committed to the agency, not to the courts.\n\n     The Supreme Court’s admonition in Chevron points to the\n\nbalance courts must strike:\n\n            Judges are not experts in the field, and are\n            not part of either political branch of the\n            Government. Courts must, in some cases,\n            reconcile competing political interests, but\n            not on the basis of the judges' personal\n            policy preferences. In contrast, an agency\n            to which Congress has delegated policy-\n            making   responsibilities    may,    within   the\n            limits of that delegation, properly rely\n            upon the incumbent administration's views of\n            wise policy to inform its judgments. While\n            agencies are not directly accountable to the\n            people, the Chief Executive is, and it is\n            entirely   appropriate   for    this    political\n            branch of the Government to make such policy\n            choices—resolving the competing interests\n\n     11 The dissent accepts the Board’s invocation of amorphous\nsafety concerns as a reason for refusing deference to the\nDepartment’s interpretation. We note that the record is devoid\nof any evidence tending to show that G.G.’s use of the boys’\nrestroom creates a safety issue.    We also note that the Board\nhas been, perhaps deliberately, vague as to the nature of the\nsafety concerns it has—whether it fears that it cannot ensure\nG.G.’s safety while in the restroom or whether it fears G.G.\nhimself is a threat to the safety of others in the restroom. We\nare unconvinced of the existence of danger caused by “sexual\nresponses prompted by students’ exposure to the private body\nparts of students of the other biological sex.”      Post at 58.\nThe same safety concern would seem to require segregated\nrestrooms for gay boys and girls who would, under the dissent’s\nformulation, present a safety risk because of the “sexual\nresponses prompted” by their exposure to the private body parts\nof other students of the same sex in sex-segregated restrooms.\n\n\n\n                                       28\n\f             which Congress itself either inadvertently\n             did not resolve, or intentionally left to be\n             resolved by the agency charged with the\n             administration of the statute in light of\n             everyday realities.\n\n\nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S.\n\n837, 865-66 (1984).         Not only may a subsequent administration\n\nchoose to implement a different policy, but Congress may also,\n\nof course, revise Title IX explicitly to prohibit or authorize\n\nthe course charted here by the Department regarding the use of\n\nrestrooms by transgender students.              To the extent the dissent\n\ncritiques the result we reach today on policy grounds, we reply\n\nthat, our Auer analysis complete, we leave policy formulation to\n\nthe political branches.\n\n\n\n                                      III.\n\n      G.G. also asks us to reverse the district court’s denial of\n\nthe preliminary injunction he sought which would have allowed\n\nhim   to   use    the   boys’    restroom    during   the   pendency    of   this\n\nlawsuit.     “To win such a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must\n\ndemonstrate that (1) they are likely to succeed on the merits;\n\n(2)   they       will   likely    suffer     irreparable    harm   absent     an\n\ninjunction; (3) the balance of hardships weighs in their favor;\n\nand (4) the injunction is in the public interest.”                     League of\n\nWomen Voters of N.C. v.

Instead, “we reverse for\n\nabuse of discretion if we form a definite and firm conviction\n\nthat the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the\n\nconclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.”\n\nId. (citations and quotations omitted).\n\n       The    district    court   analyzed        G.G.’s    request    only    with\n\nreference to the third factor—the balance of hardships—and found\n\nthat the balance of hardships did not weigh in G.G.’s favor.\n\nG.G. submitted two declarations in support of his complaint, one\n\nfrom   G.G.    himself    and   one   from    a   medical    expert,   Dr.    Randi\n\nEttner, to explain what harms G.G. will suffer as a result of\n\nhis    exclusion   from    the    boys’      restroom.      The   district    court\n\nrefused to consider this evidence because it was “replete with\n\ninadmissible evidence including thoughts of others, hearsay, and\n\nsuppositions.”     G.G., 2015 WL 5560190, at *11.\n\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\f      The    district    court      misstated       the    evidentiary       standard\n\ngoverning preliminary injunction hearings.                      The district court\n\nstated:     “The    complaint    is    no     longer      the     deciding    factor,\n\nadmissible evidence is the deciding factor.

Given this limited purpose, and\n            given the haste that is often necessary if\n            those positions are to be preserved, a\n            preliminary    injunction   is    customarily\n            granted on the basis of procedures that are\n            less formal and evidence that is less\n            complete than in a trial on the merits.\n\nUniv. of Tex. v.

Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 350 n.1 (1976)                       (taking as true\n\nthe   “well-pleaded      allegations        of    respondents’       complaint       and\n\nuncontroverted affidavits filed in support of the motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction”); compare Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (requiring\n\naffidavits supporting summary judgment to be “made on personal\n\nknowledge, [and to] set out facts that would be admissible in\n\nevidence), with Fed R. Civ. P. 65 (providing no such requirement\n\nin    the   preliminary       injunction         context).         Thus,     although\n\nadmissible    evidence    may    be    more      persuasive      than   inadmissible\n\nevidence in the preliminary injunction context, it was error for\n\n\n\n                                        31\n\fthe district court to summarily reject G.G.’s proffered evidence\n\nbecause it may have been inadmissible at a subsequent trial.\n\n      Additionally, the district court completely excluded some\n\nof G.G.’s proffered evidence on hearsay grounds.                              The seven of\n\nour   sister      circuits         to    have    considered      the    admissibility       of\n\nhearsay in preliminary injunction proceedings have decided that\n\nthe     nature    of     evidence          as    hearsay     goes      to    “weight,      not\n\npreclusion”       and     have      permitted        district    courts       to   “rely    on\n\nhearsay evidence for the limited purpose of determining whether\n\nto award a preliminary injunction.”                        Mullins v.

We see no reason for a different rule to govern in this\n\nCircuit.        Because        preliminary            injunction        proceedings      are\n\ninformal    ones     designed       to   prevent       irreparable        harm    before     a\n\nlater trial     governed       by    the    full       rigor    of    usual    evidentiary\n\nstandards,     district        courts       may        look     to,     and     indeed      in\n\nappropriate circumstances rely on, hearsay or other inadmissible\n\nevidence     when    deciding       whether       a    preliminary        injunction        is\n\nwarranted.\n\n     Because        the   district       court        evaluated       G.G.’s     proffered\n\nevidence     against      a    stricter         evidentiary          standard     than      is\n\nwarranted by the nature and purpose of preliminary injunction\n\nproceedings to prevent irreparable harm before a full trial on\n\nthe merits, the district court was “guided by erroneous legal\n\nprinciples.”         We   therefore        conclude      that     the    district      court\n\nabused   its   discretion        when      it    denied        G.G.’s    request      for    a\n\npreliminary     injunction          without       considering         G.G.’s     proffered\n\nevidence.      We     vacate    the      district       court’s       denial     of   G.G.’s\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction and remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court for consideration of G.G.’s evidence in light of\n\nthe evidentiary standards set forth herein.\n\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f                                               IV.\n\n       Finally,      G.G.    requests         that    we   reassign     this     case   to    a\n\ndifferent district judge on remand.                        G.G. does not explicitly\n\nclaim that the district judge is biased.                        Absent such a claim,\n\nreassignment is only appropriate in “unusual circumstances where\n\nboth    for    the   judge’s       sake       and    the   appearance     of   justice       an\n\nassignment to a different judge is salutary and in the public\n\ninterest,      especially          as    it    minimizes      even    a    suspicion         of\n\npartiality.”         United States v. Guglielmi, 929 F.2d 1001, 1007\n\n(4th Cir. 1991) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nIn determining whether such circumstances exist, a court should\n\nconsider: (1) whether the original judge would reasonably be\n\nexpected upon remand to have substantial difficulty in putting\n\nout of his or her mind previously expressed views or findings\n\ndetermined to be erroneous or based on evidence that must be\n\nrejected, (2) whether reassignment is advisable to preserve the\n\nappearance of justice, and (3) whether reassignment would entail\n\nwaste    and     duplication            out    of    proportion      to    any     gain      in\n\npreserving the appearance of fairness.                      Id. (citation omitted).\n\n       G.G.    argues       that    both       the    first    and    second      Guglielmi\n\nfactors are satisfied.              He contends that the district court has\n\npre-existing views which it would be unwilling to put aside in\n\nthe face of contrary evidence about medical science generally\n\nand about “gender and sexuality in particular.”                           Appellant’s Br.\n\n\n                                                34\n\f53.    For    example,    the    court    accepted   the    Board’s    “mating”\n\nconcern by noting:\n\n             There    are    only    two    instincts—two.\n             Everything   else    is  acquired—everything.\n             That is, the brain only has two instincts.\n             One is called self-preservation, and the\n             other is procreation.     And procreation is\n             the highest instinct in individuals who are\n             in the latter part of their teen-age years.\n             All of that is accepted by all medical\n             science, as far as I can determine in\n             reading information.\n\nJ.A. 85-86.\n\n      The district court also expressed skepticism that medical\n\nscience   supported      the    proposition   that   one    could     develop   a\n\nurinary tract infection from withholding urine for too long.\n\nJ.A. 111-12.     The district court characterized gender dysphoria\n\nas a “mental disorder” and resisted several attempts by counsel\n\nfor G.G. to clarify that it only becomes a disorder when left\n\nuntreated.      See J.A. 88-91; 101-02.          The district court also\n\nseemed to reject G.G.’s representation of what it meant to be\n\ntransgender, repeatedly noting that G.G. “wants” to be a boy and\n\nnot a girl, but that “he is biologically a female.”                   J.A. 103-\n\n04; see also J.A. 104 (“It’s his mind. It’s not physical that\n\ncauses that, it’s what he believes.”).               The district court’s\n\nmemorandum    opinion,    however,    included   none      of   the   extraneous\n\nremarks or suppositions that marred the hearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\f     Reassignment      is   an   unusual   step   at   this   early   stage   of\n\nlitigation.     Although the district court did express opinions\n\nabout medical facts and skepticism of G.G.’s claims, the record\n\ndoes not clearly indicate that the district judge would refuse\n\nto   consider   and    credit     sound    contrary    evidence.      Further,\n\nalthough the district court has a distinct way of proceeding in\n\ncourt, the hearing record and the district court’s written order\n\nin the case do not raise in our minds a question about the\n\nfundamental fairness of the proceedings, however idiosyncratic.\n\nThe conduct of the district judge does not at this point satisfy\n\nthe Guglielmi standard.          We deny G.G.’s request for reassignment\n\nto a different district judge on remand.\n\n\n\n                                      V.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is\n\n                      REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      36\n\fDAVIS, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n     I     concur       in    Judge        Floyd’s   fine     opinion.         I    write\n\nseparately, however, to note that while I am happy to join in\n\nthe remand of this matter to the district court so that it may\n\nconsider G.G.’s evidence under proper legal standards in the\n\nfirst instance, this Court would be on sound ground in granting\n\nthe requested preliminary injunction on the undisputed facts in\n\nthe record.\n\n                                              I.\n\n     In    order    to       obtain    a    preliminary     injunction,      G.G.    must\n\ndemonstrate that (1) he is likely to succeed on the merits, (2)\n\nhe is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an\n\ninjunction, (3) the balance of hardships tips in his favor, and\n\n(4) the requested injunction is in the public interest.

The record\n\nbefore us establishes that G.G. has done so.\n\n                                              A.\n\n     G.G.       alleges      that     by     singling   him      out   for    different\n\ntreatment because he is transgender, the Board’s restroom policy\n\ndiscriminates against him “on the basis of sex” in violation of\n\nTitle     IX.      In     light       of    the    weight   of    circuit     authority\n\nconcluding that discrimination against transgender individuals\n\nconstitutes discrimination “on the basis of sex” in the context\n\n\n                                              37\n\fof analogous statutes and our holding here that the Department’s\n\ninterpretation of 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 is to be given controlling\n\nweight, G.G. has surely demonstrated a likelihood of success on\n\nthe merits of his Title IX claim.

See J.A.\n\n32–33.    His    affidavit       also   indicates    that    he    has      “repeatedly\n\ndeveloped       painful    urinary      tract    infections”      as    a    result   of\n\nholding    his    urine     in   order      to   avoid    using   the    restroom     at\n\nschool.    Id.\n\n     An expert declaration by Dr. Randi Ettner, a psychologist\n\nspecializing       in     working    with    children      and    adolescents     with\n\ngender dysphoria, provides further support for G.G.’s claim of\n\nirreparable harm.          In her affidavit, Dr. Ettner indicates that\n\ntreating a transgender boy as male in some situations but not in\n\nothers is “inconsistent with evidence-based medical practice and\n\n\n                                            38\n\fdetrimental       to   the    health      and       well-being      of     the    child”       and\n\nexplains why access to a restroom appropriate to one’s gender\n\nidentity is important for transgender youth.                               J.A. 39.          With\n\nrespect to G.G. in particular, Dr. Ettner states that in her\n\nprofessional opinion, the Board’s restroom policy “is currently\n\ncausing emotional distress to an extremely vulnerable youth and\n\nplacing G.G. at risk for accruing lifelong psychological harm.”\n\nJ.A. 41.    In particular, Dr. Ettner opines that\n\n     [a]s a result of the School Board’s restroom policy, .\n     . . G.G. is put in the humiliating position of having\n     to use a separate facility, thereby accentuating his\n     ‘otherness,’ undermining his identity formation, and\n     impeding his medically necessary social transition\n     process.     The shame of being singled out and\n     stigmatized in his daily life every time he needs to\n     use the restroom is a devastating blow to G.G. and\n     places him at extreme risk for immediate and long-term\n     psychological harm.\n\nJ.A. 42.\n\n     The    Board       offers       nothing         to   contradict          any       of     the\n\nassertions concerning irreparable harm in G.G.’s or Dr. Ettner’s\n\naffidavits.       Instead, its arguments focus on what is purportedly\n\nlacking    from    G.G.’s     presentation           in   support        of   his      claim    of\n\nirreparable       harm,      such    as   “evidence          that    [his        feelings       of\n\ndysphoria, anxiety, and distress] would be lessened by using the\n\nboy[s’]    restroom,”        evidence      from        his    treating        psychologist,\n\nmedical     evidence,          and        an        opinion         from         Dr.     Ettner\n\n“differentiating between the distress that G.G. may suffer by\n\n\n\n                                               39\n\fnot    using       the    boy[s’]       bathroom     during        the    course        of    this\n\nlitigation and the distress that he has apparently been living\n\nwith since age 12.”                Br. Appellee 42–43.                As to the alleged\n\ndeficiency concerning Dr. Ettner’s opinion, the Board’s argument\n\nis belied by Dr. Ettner’s affidavit itself, which, as quoted\n\nabove, provides her opinion about the psychological harm that\n\nG.G.    is    experiencing         “[a]s    a    result       of    the    School        Board’s\n\nrestroom policy.”              J.A. 42.    With respect to the other purported\n\ninadequacies,           the    absence    of     such   evidence          does    nothing       to\n\nundermine         the    uncontroverted        statements       concerning         the       daily\n\npsychological harm G.G. experiences as a result of the Board’s\n\npolicy       or    Dr.    Ettner’s       unchallenged         opinion      concerning          the\n\nsignificant long-term consequences of that harm.                               Moreover, the\n\nBoard offers no argument to counter G.G.’s averment that he has\n\nrepeatedly contracted a urinary tract infection as a result of\n\nholding his urine to avoid using the restroom at school.\n\n       The        uncontroverted         facts      before         the     district          court\n\ndemonstrate that as a result of the Board’s restroom policy,\n\nG.G. experiences daily psychological harm that puts him at risk\n\nfor    long-term         psychological      harm,       and    his       avoidance       of    the\n\nrestroom as a result of the Board’s policy puts him at risk for\n\ndeveloping a urinary tract infection as he has repeatedly in the\n\npast.         G.G.       has     thus     demonstrated         that       he     will        suffer\n\nirreparable harm in the absence of an injunction.\n\n\n                                               40\n\f                                          C.\n\n       Turning to the balance of the hardships, G.G. has shown\n\nthat   he   will     suffer   irreparable        harm   without   the   requested\n\ninjunction.        On the other end of the scale, the Board contends\n\nthat other students’ constitutional right to privacy will be\n\nimperiled by G.G.’s presence in the boys’ restroom.\n\n       As   the    majority   opinion     points     out,   G.G.’s   use   of   the\n\nrestroom     does     not     implicate        the   unconstitutional      actions\n\ninvolved in the cases cited by the dissent.                 Moreover, students’\n\nunintentional exposure of their genitals to others using the\n\nrestroom has already been largely, if not entirely, remedied by\n\nthe alterations to the school’s restrooms already undertaken by\n\nthe Board.        To the extent that a student simply objects to using\n\nthe restroom in the presence of a transgender student even where\n\nthere is no possibility that either student’s genitals will be\n\nexposed, all students have access to the single-stall restrooms.\n\nFor other students, using the single-stall restrooms carries no\n\nstigma whatsoever, whereas for G.G., using those same restrooms\n\nis tantamount to humiliation and a continuing mark of difference\n\namong his fellow students.          The minimal or non-existent hardship\n\nto other students of using the single-stall restrooms if they\n\nobject to G.G.’s presence in the communal restroom thus does not\n\ntip the scale in the Board’s favor.                  The balance of hardships\n\nweighs heavily toward G.G.\n\n\n                                          41\n\f                                           D.\n\n       Finally, consideration of the public interest in granting\n\nor    denying    the   preliminary       injunction        favors     G.G.      Having\n\nconcluded that G.G. has demonstrated a likelihood of success on\n\nthe    merits    of    his    Title     IX      claim,    denying     the    requested\n\ninjunction would permit the Board to continue violating G.G.’s\n\nrights under Title IX for the pendency of this case.                         Enforcing\n\nG.G.’s right to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex\n\nin an educational institution is plainly in the public interest.\n\nCf. Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 521 (4th\n\nCir.    2002)     (citation        omitted)        (observing       that     upholding\n\nconstitutional rights is in the public interest).\n\n       The    Board    contends     that     the    public      interest     lies   in\n\nallowing this issue to be determined by the legislature, citing\n\npending legislation before Congress addressing the issue before\n\nthe Court.       But, as discussed above, the weight of authority\n\nestablishes that discrimination based on transgender status is\n\nalready      prohibited      by   the   language     of    federal     civil    rights\n\nstatutes, as interpreted by the Supreme Court.                      The existence of\n\nproposed legislation that, if passed, would address the question\n\nbefore us does not justify forcing G.G. to suffer irreparable\n\nharm when he has demonstrated that he is likely to succeed on\n\nthe merits of his claims under current federal law.\n\n\n\n\n                                           42\n\f                                             II.\n\n      Based on the evidence presented to the district court, G.G.\n\nhas   satisfied     all    four    prongs         of   the    preliminary     injunction\n\ninquiry.         When    the   record        before      us     supports   entry     of    a\n\npreliminary       injunction—as         it    amply       does     here—we    have    not\n\nhesitated to act to prevent irreparable injury to a litigant\n\nbefore us.       See, e.g., League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North\n\nCarolina, 769 F.3d 224, 248 (4th Cir. 2014) (expressly observing\n\nthat appellate courts have the power to vacate a denial of a\n\npreliminary      injunction       and    direct         entry    of   an   injunction);\n\nEisenberg ex rel. Eisenberg v. Montgomery Cty. Pub. Schs., 197\n\nF.3d 123, 134 (4th Cir. 1999) (directing entry of injunction\n\n“because the record clearly establishes the plaintiff’s right to\n\nan    injunction    and    [an     evidentiary]           hearing     would   not     have\n\naltered the result”).\n\n      Nevertheless, it is right and proper that we defer to the\n\ndistrict court in this instance.                       It is to be hoped that the\n\ndistrict court will turn its attention to this matter with the\n\nurgency    the    case    poses.        Under      the    circumstances       here,       the\n\nappropriateness and necessity of such prompt action is plain.\n\nBy the time the district court issues its decision, G.G. will\n\nhave suffered the psychological harm the injunction sought to\n\nprevent for an entire school year.\n\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\f     With these additional observations, I concur fully in Judge\nFloyd’s   thoughtful  and  thorough   opinion  for   the  panel.\n\n\n\n\n                               44\n\fNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n      I concur in Part IV of the court’s opinion.                            With respect\n\nto whether G.G. stated a claim under Title IX and whether the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying G.G’s motion for\n\na   preliminary       injunction,     I     would   affirm       the    ruling       of    the\n\ndistrict court dismissing G.G.’s Title IX claim and denying his\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction.                    I therefore dissent from\n\nthe majority’s decision on those issues.\n\n      G.G.,     a     transgender         boy     who     is    16,     challenges          as\n\ndiscriminatory, under the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX\n\nof the Education Amendments of 1972, his high school’s policy\n\nfor assigning students to restrooms and locker rooms based on\n\nbiological sex.            The school’s policy provides:                     (1) that the\n\ngirls’   restrooms         and   locker    rooms    are    designated         for    use    by\n\nstudents      who    are     biologically        female;       (2)     that    the    boys’\n\nrestrooms and locker rooms are designated for use by students\n\nwho are biologically male; and (3) that all students, regardless\n\nof their sex, are authorized to use the school’s three single-\n\nstall unisex restrooms, which the school created to accommodate\n\ntransgender         students.        Under       this     policy,       G.G.,       who    is\n\nbiologically female but who identifies as male, is authorized to\n\nuse   the     girls’    restrooms         and    locker    rooms       and    the    unisex\n\nrestrooms.      He contends, however, that the policy discriminates\n\n\n\n                                            45\n\fagainst him because it denies him, as one who identifies as\n\nmale, the use of the boys’ restrooms, and he seeks an injunction\n\ncompelling      the     high    school    to     allow    him    to     use    the       boys’\n\nrestrooms.\n\n        The    district      court    dismissed         G.G.’s     Title       IX       claim,\n\nexplaining      that     the    school    complied       with    Title        IX       and   its\n\nregulations,      which      permit   schools      to    provide      separate          living\n\nfacilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities “on\n\nthe basis of sex,” so long as the facilities are “comparable.”\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1686; 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.32(b), 106.33.\n\n      Strikingly, the majority now reverses the district court’s\n\nruling, without any supporting case law, and concludes that when\n\nTitle     IX    and    its     regulations       provide     for      separate          living\n\nfacilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities on\n\nthe basis of sex, the statute’s and regulations’ use of the term\n\n“sex”     means    a    person’s      gender      identity,       not    the        person’s\n\nbiological status as male or female.                     To accomplish its goal,\n\nthe   majority        relies   entirely     on    a   2015      letter    sent          by   the\n\nDepartment of Education’s Office for Civil Rights to G.G., in\n\nwhich the Office for Civil Rights stated, “When a school elects\n\nto separate or treat students differently on the basis of sex\n\n[when    providing       restrooms,      locker       rooms,     shower       facilities,\n\nhousing,       athletic      teams,   and      single-sex       classes],          a    school\n\ngenerally must treat transgender students consistent with their\n\n\n                                            46\n\fgender    identity.”           (Emphasis         added).       Accepting        that        new\n\ndefinition of the statutory term “sex,” the majority’s opinion,\n\nfor the first time ever, holds that a public high school may not\n\nprovide   separate       restrooms        and    locker    rooms    on    the       basis    of\n\nbiological sex.          Rather, it must now allow a biological male\n\nstudent who identifies as female to use the girls’ restrooms and\n\nlocker    rooms    and,      likewise,      must       allow   a   biological         female\n\nstudent who identifies as male to use the boys’ restrooms and\n\nlocker    rooms.          This      holding          completely    tramples          on     all\n\nuniversally accepted protections of privacy and safety that are\n\nbased on the anatomical differences between the sexes.                                    And,\n\nunwittingly, it also tramples on the very concerns expressed by\n\nG.G., who said that he should not be forced to go to the girls’\n\nrestrooms      because    of     the   “severe         psychological      distress”          it\n\nwould inflict on him and because female students had “reacted\n\nnegatively”       to   his     presence         in    girls’   restrooms.             Surely\n\nbiological males who identify as females would encounter similar\n\nreactions in the girls’ restroom, just as students physically\n\nexposed   to    students       of   the    opposite       biological      sex       would    be\n\nlikely    to   experience        psychological          distress.         As    a    result,\n\nschools would no longer be able to protect physiological privacy\n\nas between students of the opposite biological sex.\n\n      This unprecedented holding overrules custom, culture, and\n\nthe   very     demands    inherent        in    human     nature    for    privacy          and\n\n\n                                            47\n\fsafety, which the separation of such facilities is designed to\n\nprotect.        More     particularly,              it    also      misconstrues       the     clear\n\nlanguage       of   Title    IX    and        its    regulations.               And   finally,     it\n\nreaches an unworkable and illogical result.\n\n       The recent Office for Civil Rights letter, moreover, which\n\nis not law but which is the only authority on which the majority\n\nrelies,    states        more   than      the       majority        acknowledges.            In   the\n\nsentence following the sentence on which the majority relies,\n\nthe    letter       states     that,     to     accommodate          transgender        students,\n\nschools       are    encouraged         “to    offer          the   use    of    gender-neutral,\n\nindividual-user facilities to any student who does not want to\n\nuse shared sex-segregated facilities [as permitted by Title IX’s\n\nregulations].”           This appears to approve the course that G.G.’s\n\nschool followed when it created unisex restrooms in addition to\n\nthe boys’ and girls’ restrooms it already had.\n\n       Title        IX   and      its         implementing           regulations         are      not\n\nambiguous.          In recognition of physiological privacy and safety\n\nconcerns,       they      allow     schools              to    provide      “separate        living\n\nfacilities for the different sexes,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, provided\n\nthat    the    facilities         are    “proportionate”              and       “comparable,”      34\n\nC.F.R.    §    106.32(b),         and    to     provide         “separate        toilet,     locker\n\nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” again provided\n\nthat     the    facilities         are        “comparable,”           34    C.F.R.      § 106.33.\n\nBecause the school’s policy that G.G. challenges in this action\n\n\n                                                    48\n\fcomports with Title IX and its regulations, I would affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of G.G.’s Title IX claim.\n\n\n                                            I\n\n       The relevant facts are not in dispute.                    G.G. is a 16 year-\n\nold who attends Gloucester High School in Gloucester County,\n\nVirginia.     He is biologically female, but “did not feel like a\n\ngirl” from an early age.              Still, he enrolled at Gloucester High\n\nSchool for his freshman year as a female.\n\n       During his freshman year, however, G.G. told his parents\n\nthat   he    considered         himself    to    be    transgender,         and    shortly\n\nthereafter,     at        his     request,       he     began        therapy       with    a\n\npsychologist,       who        diagnosed   him        with    gender       dysphoria,      a\n\ncondition of distress brought about by the incongruence of one’s\n\nbiological sex and gender identity.\n\n       In August 2014, before beginning his sophomore year, G.G.\n\nand his mother met with the principal and guidance counselor at\n\nGloucester    High    School       to   discuss       his    need,    as   part     of    his\n\ntreatment,     to    socially         transition       at    school.         The    school\n\naccommodated    all       of    his   requests.         Officials      changed      school\n\nrecords to reflect G.G.’s new male name; the guidance counselor\n\nsupported G.G.’s sending an email to teachers explaining that he\n\nwas to be addressed using his new name and to be referred to\n\nusing male pronouns; G.G. was permitted to fulfill his physical\n\n\n\n                                           49\n\feducation        requirement          through      a    home-bound        program,      as     he\n\npreferred not to use the school’s locker rooms; and the school\n\nallowed G.G. to use a restroom in the nurse’s office “because\n\n[he]     was     unsure      how      other      students      would      react    to    [his]\n\ntransition.”           G.G.     was    grateful        for    the   school’s      “welcoming\n\nenvironment.”           As he stated, “no teachers, administrators, or\n\nstaff    at      Gloucester      High      School      expressed     any    resistance        to\n\ncalling [him] by [his] legal name or referring to [him] using\n\nmale pronouns.”              And he was “pleased to discover that [his]\n\nteachers and the vast majority of [his] peers respected the fact\n\nthat [he is] a boy.”\n\n       As      the     school       year      began,      however,        G.G.     found      it\n\n“stigmatizing” to continue using the nurse’s restroom, and he\n\nrequested        to    use    the     boys’      restrooms.         The    principal         also\n\naccommodated this request.                    But the very next day, the School\n\nBoard    began        receiving       “numerous        complaints      from      parents     and\n\nstudents about [G.G.’s] use of the boys’ restrooms.”                              The School\n\nBoard thus faced a dilemma.                    It recognized G.G.’s feelings, as\n\nhe expressed them, that “[u]sing the girls’ restroom[s] [was]\n\nnot possible” because of the “severe psychological distress” it\n\nwould inflict on him and because female students had previously\n\n“reacted negatively” to his presence in the girls’ restrooms.\n\nIt now also had to recognize that boys had similar feelings\n\ncaused      by    G.G.’s     use    of     the    boys’      restrooms,     although         G.G.\n\n\n                                                 50\n\fstated    that    he    continued    using     the    boys’   restrooms       for   some\n\nseven weeks without personally receiving complaints from fellow\n\nstudents.\n\n     The Gloucester County School Board considered the problem\n\nand, after two public meetings, adopted a compromise policy, as\n\nfollows:\n\n     Whereas   the  GCPS   recognizes  that                   some     students\n     question their gender identities, and\n\n     Whereas the GCPS encourages such students                         to seek\n     support,   advice,    and   guidance    from                      parents,\n     professionals and other trusted adults, and\n\n     Whereas the GCPS seeks to provide                     a safe learning\n     environment for all students and                      to protect the\n     privacy of all students, therefore\n\n     It shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide male\n     and female restroom and locker room facilities in its\n     schools, and the use of said facilities shall be\n     limited to the corresponding biological genders, and\n     students with gender identity issues shall be provided\n     an alternative appropriate private facility.\n\nGloucester       High    School     promptly    implemented      the    policy      and\n\ncreated    three       single-stall    unisex        restrooms   for    use    by   all\n\nstudents, regardless of their biological sex or gender identity.\n\n     In December 2014, G.G. sought an opinion letter about his\n\nsituation from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for\n\nCivil Rights, and on January 15, 2015, the Office responded,\n\nstating, as relevant here:\n\n     The Department’s Title IX regulations permit schools\n     to provide sex-segregated restrooms, locker rooms,\n     shower   facilities,  housing,  athletic  teams,  and\n     single-sex classes under certain circumstances.  When\n\n\n                                         51\n\f     a school elects to separate or treat students\n     differently on the basis of sex in those situations, a\n     school generally must treat transgender students\n     consistent with their gender identity.     [The Office\n     for Civil Rights] also encourages schools to offer the\n     use of gender-neutral, individual-user facilities to\n     any student who does not want to use shared sex-\n     segregated facilities.\n\n     G.G. commenced this action in June 2015, alleging that the\n\nGloucester County School Board’s policy was discriminatory, in\n\nviolation of the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause and\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681\n\net seq.    He sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and\n\ndamages.   With his complaint, G.G. also filed a motion for a\n\npreliminary   injunction    “requiring   the   School   Board   to   allow\n\n[him] to use the boys’ restrooms at school.”\n\n     The district court dismissed G.G.’s Title IX claim because\n\nTitle IX’s implementing regulations permit schools to provide\n\nseparate restrooms “on the basis of sex.”        The court also denied\n\nG.G.’s motion for a preliminary injunction.             As to the Equal\n\nProtection claim, the court has not yet ruled on whether G.G.\n\nfailed to state a claim, but, at the hearing on the motion for a\n\npreliminary   injunction,     it   indicated    that    it   “will   hear\n\nevidence” and “get a date set” for trial to better assess the\n\nclaim.\n\n     From the district court’s order denying G.G.’s motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction, G.G. filed this appeal, in which he also\n\n\n\n\n                                   52\n\fchallenges the district court’s Title IX ruling as inextricably\n\nintertwined with the district court’s denial of the motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction.\n\n\n                                                II\n\n     G.G.    recognizes            that   persons          who   are     born    biologically\n\nfemale    “typically”         identify          psychologically           as     female,    and\n\nlikewise,       that        persons       who        are     born      biologically        male\n\n“typically”      identify           as    male.             Because       G.G.     was     born\n\nbiologically     female       but     identifies           as    male,    he    characterizes\n\nhimself as a transgender male.                       He contends that because he is\n\ntransgender, the School Board singled him out for “different and\n\nunequal treatment,” “discriminat[ing] against him based on sex\n\n[by denying him use of the boys’ restrooms], in violation of\n\nTitle    IX.”         He    argues,       “discrimination           against       transgender\n\npeople is necessarily discrimination based on sex because it is\n\nimpossible       to        treat     people          differently         based     on      their\n\ntransgender status without taking their sex into account.”                                   He\n\nconcludes that the School Board’s policy addressing restrooms\n\nand locker rooms thus illegally fails to include transgender\n\npersons on the basis of their gender identity.                                 In particular,\n\nhe concludes that he is “prevent[ed] . . . from using the same\n\nrestrooms as other students and relegat[ed] . . . to separate,\n\nsingle-stall facilities.”\n\n\n\n                                                53\n\f      As noted, the School Board’s policy designates the use of\n\nrestrooms and locker rooms based on the student’s biological sex\n\n-- biological females are assigned to the girls’ restrooms and\n\nunisex restrooms; biological males are assigned to the boys’\n\nrestrooms and unisex restrooms.               G.G. is thus assigned to the\n\ngirls’ restrooms and the unisex restrooms, but is denied the use\n\nof   the   boys’    restrooms.      He    asserts,   however,   that    because\n\nneither he nor the girls would accept his use of the girls’\n\nrestroom,    he    is   relegated   to   the   unisex   restrooms,     which   is\n\nstigmatizing.\n\n      The School Board contends that it is treating all students\n\nthe same way, as it explains:\n\n      The School Board’s policy does not discriminate\n      against any class of students.     Instead, the policy\n      was developed to treat all students and situations the\n      same.    To respect the safety and privacy of all\n      students, the School Board has had a long-standing\n      practice of limiting the use of restroom and locker\n      room facilities to the corresponding biological sex of\n      the students.    The School Board also provides three\n      single-stall   bathrooms  for  any    student   to  use\n      regardless of his or her biological sex.      Under the\n      School Board’s restroom policy, G.G. is being treated\n      like every other student in the Gloucester Schools.\n      All students have two choices. Every student can use\n      a restroom associated with their anatomical sex,\n      whether they are boys or girls.     If students choose\n      not to use the restroom associated with their\n      anatomical sex, the students can use a private,\n      single-stall restroom. No student is permitted to use\n      the restroom of the opposite sex.     As a result, all\n      students, including female to male transgender and\n      male to female transgender students, are treated the\n      same.\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\f       While G.G. has pending a claim under the Equal Protection\n\nClause (on which the district court has not yet ruled), only his\n\npreliminary injunction challenge and Title IX claim are before\n\nus at this time.\n\n       Title IX provides:\n\n       No person in the United States shall, on the basis of\n       sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\n       benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\n       any education program or activity receiving Federal\n       financial assistance . . . .\n\n20   U.S.C.        §   1681(a)    (emphasis   added).          The   Act,    however,\n\nprovides, “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in\n\nthis chapter, nothing contained herein shall be construed to\n\nprohibit any educational institution receiving funds under this\n\nAct,     from      maintaining     separate    living      facilities        for   the\n\ndifferent sexes.”           Id. § 1686 (emphasis added); see also 34\n\nC.F.R.    §     106.32(b)    (permitting      schools     to    provide     “separate\n\nhousing       on    the   basis   of   sex”   as   long    as     the   housing     is\n\n“proportionate” and “comparable” (emphasis added)).                         Similarly,\n\nimplementing Regulation 106.33 provides for particular separate\n\nfacilities, as follows:\n\n       A recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room,\n       and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such\n       facilities provided for students of one sex shall be\n       comparable to such facilities provided for students of\n       the other sex.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 106.33 (emphasis added).                Thus, although Title IX\n\nand its regulations provide generally that a school receiving\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\ffederal funds may not discriminate on the basis of sex, they\n\nalso     specify         that    a   school        does     not    violate       the    Act   by\n\nproviding,          on    the   basis      of    sex,     separate      living    facilities,\n\nrestrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities.\n\n       While G.G. only challenges the definition and application\n\nof the term “sex” with respect to separate restrooms, acceptance\n\nof his argument would necessarily change the definition of “sex”\n\nfor    purposes          of   assigning     separate        living      facilities,      locker\n\nrooms, and shower facilities as well.                        All are based on “sex,” a\n\nterm that must be construed uniformly throughout Title IX and\n\nits implementing regulations.                     See Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U.S.\n\n478, 484 (1990) (“[T]he normal rule of statutory construction\n\n[is] that identical words used in different parts of the same\n\nact are intended to have the same meaning” (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted)); In re Total Realty Mgmt., LLC,\n\n706 F.3d 245, 251 (4th Cir. 2013) (“Canons of construction . . .\n\nrequire that, to the extent possible, identical terms or phrases\n\nused in different parts of the same statute be interpreted as\n\nhaving        the        same   meaning.

An individual has a legitimate and important interest\n\nin bodily privacy such that his or her nude or partially nude\n\nbody,    genitalia,       and    other       private          parts    are    not       exposed     to\n\npersons of the opposite biological sex.                                Indeed, courts have\n\nconsistently       recognized         that        the     need      for      such       privacy     is\n\ninherent in the nature and dignity of humankind.

See Faulkner\n\nv. Jones, 10 F.3d 226, 232 (4th Cir. 1993) (noting “society’s\n\nundisputed approval of separate public rest rooms for men and\n\nwomen based on privacy concerns”).                          Indeed, the Supreme Court\n\nrecognized, when ordering an all-male Virginia college to admit\n\nfemale students, that such a remedy “would undoubtedly require\n\nalterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from\n\n\n                                                58\n\fthe other sex.”          United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 550\n\nn.19 (1996).      Such privacy was and remains necessary because of\n\nthe   inherent    “[p]hysical      differences           between    men   and    women,”\n\nwhich, as the Supreme Court explained, are “enduring” and render\n\n“the two sexes . . . not fungible,” id. at 533 (distinguishing\n\nsex from race and national origin), not because of “one’s sense\n\nof oneself as belonging to a particular gender,” as G.G. and the\n\ngovernment as amicus contend.\n\n      Thus, Title IX’s allowance for the separation, based on\n\nsex, of living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower\n\nfacilities rests on the universally accepted concern for bodily\n\nprivacy that is founded on the biological differences between\n\nthe   sexes.      This    privacy   concern         is    also     linked   to    safety\n\nconcerns   that    could    arise    from     sexual       responses      prompted      by\n\nstudents’ exposure to the private body parts of students of the\n\nother biological sex.        Indeed, the School Board cited these very\n\nreasons    for   its    adoption    of   the    policy,       explaining         that   it\n\nseparates restrooms and locker rooms to promote the privacy and\n\nsafety of minor children, pursuant to its “responsibility to its\n\nstudents   to    ensure    their    privacy     while       engaging      in    personal\n\nbathroom functions, disrobing, dressing, and showering outside\n\nof the presence of members of the opposite sex.                                [That the\n\nschool    has    this    responsibility]       is    particularly         true    in    an\n\n\n\n\n                                         59\n\fenvironment         where     children        are    still       developing,          both\n\nemotionally and physically.”\n\n      The need to protect privacy and safety between the sexes\n\nbased on physical exposure would not be present in the same\n\nquality and degree if the term “sex” were to encompass only a\n\nperson’s     gender      identity.         Indeed,   separation       on   this    basis\n\nwould function nonsensically.                A biological male identifying as\n\nfemale could hardly live in a girls’ dorm or shower in a girls’\n\nshower     without      invading    physiological         privacy    needs,     and    the\n\nsame would hold true for a biological female identifying as male\n\nin a boys’ dorm or shower.                G.G.’s answer, of course, is that he\n\nis   not    challenging       the   separation,      on    the   basis     of   sex,   of\n\nliving facilities, locker rooms, and shower facilities, but only\n\nof restrooms, where the risks to privacy and safety are far\n\nreduced.         This effort to limit the scope of the issue apparently\n\nsways      the    majority,    as    it    cabins    its    entire    discussion       to\n\n“restroom access by transgender individuals.”                       Ante at 26.        But\n\nthis effort to restrict the effect of G.G.’s argument hardly\n\nmatters when the term “sex” would have to be applied uniformly\n\nthroughout        the   statute     and    regulations,     as     noted   above      and,\n\nindeed, as agreed to by the majority.                See ante at 26.\n\n      The        realities    underpinning       Title      IX’s     recognition       of\n\nseparate living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower\n\nfacilities are reflected in the plain language of the statute\n\n\n                                            60\n\fand regulations, which is not ambiguous.                        The text of Title IX\n\nand its regulations allowing for separation of each facility “on\n\nthe   basis    of    sex”    employs       the    term    “sex”      as    was     generally\n\nunderstood at the time of enactment.

Indeed,\n\nalthough the contemporaneous meaning controls our analysis, it\n\nis notable that, even today, the term “sex” continues to be\n\ndefined based on the physiological distinctions between males\n\nand females.         See, e.g., Webster’s New World College Dictionary\n\n1331   (5th    ed.    2014)      (“either      of     the    two    divisions,       male    or\n\nfemale, into which persons, animals, or plants are divided, with\n\nreference      to    their       reproductive          functions”);       The        American\n\nHeritage    Dictionary        1605      (5th    ed.    2011)       (“Either    of    the    two\n\ndivisions, designated female and male, by which most organisms\n\nare classified on the basis of their reproductive organs and\n\nfunctions”); Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 1140 (11th\n\n\n                                               62\n\fed. 2011) (“either of the two major forms of individuals that\n\noccur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as\n\nfemale or male esp. on the basis of their reproductive organs\n\nand   structures”).        Any    new    definition      of    sex   that         excludes\n\nreference    to     physiological       differences,     as    the     majority          now\n\nattempts     to    introduce,     is    simply     an    unsupported         reach       to\n\nrationalize a desired outcome.\n\n      Thus, when the School Board assigned restrooms and locker\n\nrooms on the basis of biological sex, it was clearly complying\n\nprecisely    with    the   unambiguous        language   of    Title    IX        and    its\n\nregulations.\n\n      Despite     the   fact     that   the     majority      offers    no        case   to\n\nsupport     the    definition     of    “sex”     as    advanced       by     G.G.       and\n\nsupported by the government as amicus, the majority nonetheless\n\naccepts that the meaning of the term “sex” in Title IX and its\n\nregulations refers to a person’s “gender identity” simply to\n\naccommodate G.G.’s wish to use the boys’ restrooms.                         But, it is\n\nnot immediately apparent whether G.G., the government, and the\n\nmajority contend that the term “sex” as used in Title IX and its\n\nregulations       refers   (1)    to    both     biological      sex        and    gender\n\nidentity; (2) to either biological sex or gender identity; or\n\n(3) to only “gender identity.”            In his brief, G.G. seems to take\n\nthe position that the term “sex” at least includes a reference\n\nto gender identity.        This is the position taken in his complaint\n\n\n                                         63\n\fwhen he alleges, “Under Title IX, discrimination ‘on the basis\n\nof   sex’   encompasses     both   discrimination        based     on   biological\n\ndifferences between men and women and discrimination based on\n\ngender nonconformity.”         The government seems to be taking the\n\nsame position, contending that the term “sex” “encompasses both\n\nsex -- that is, the biological differences between men and women\n\n--   and    gender    [identity].”       (Emphasis      in    original).          The\n\nmajority, however, seems to suggest that the term “sex” refers\n\nonly to gender identity, as it relies solely on the statement in\n\nthe Office for Civil Rights’ letter of January 7, 2015, which\n\nsaid,   “When    a    school   elects    to    separate      or   treat       students\n\ndifferently on the basis of sex [for the purpose of providing\n\nrestrooms,      locker    rooms,   and       other    facilities],        a    school\n\ngenerally must treat transgender students consistent with their\n\ngender identity.”         (Emphasis added).          But, regardless of where\n\nG.G., the government, and the majority purport to stand on this\n\nquestion, the clear effect of their new definition of sex not\n\nonly tramples the relevant statutory and regulatory language and\n\ndisregards the privacy concerns animating that text, it is also\n\nillogical and unworkable.\n\n      If the term “sex” as used in the statute and regulations\n\nrefers to both biological sex and gender identity, then, while\n\nthe School Board’s policy is in compliance with respect to most\n\nstudents,     whose      biological     sex    aligns     with     their       gender\n\n\n                                        64\n\fidentity, for students whose biological sex and gender identity\n\ndo not align, no restroom or locker room separation could ever\n\nbe    accomplished      consistent         with       the     regulation           because    a\n\ntransgender      student’s     use    of       a   boys’    or    girls’          restroom    or\n\nlocker room could not satisfy the conjunctive criteria.                                    Given\n\nthat G.G. and the government do not challenge schools’ ability\n\nto    separate   restrooms     and     locker        rooms       for    male       and   female\n\nstudents,     surely    they   cannot       be      advocating         an    interpretation\n\nthat places schools in an impossible position.                              Moreover, such\n\nan interpretation would deny G.G. the right to use either the\n\nboys’    or   girls’     restrooms,        a       position      that       G.G.    does     not\n\nadvocate.\n\n       If the position of G.G., the government, and the majority\n\nis that the term “sex” means either biological sex or gender\n\nidentity,     then     the   School     Board’s         policy         is    in    compliance\n\nbecause it segregates the facilities on the basis of biological\n\nsex, a satisfactory component of the disjunctive.\n\n       Therefore, when asserting that G.G. must be allowed to use\n\nthe   boys’   restrooms      and     locker        rooms    as    consistent         with    his\n\ngender identity, G.G., the government, and the majority must be\n\narguing that “sex” as used in Title IX and its regulations means\n\nonly gender identity.          But this construction would, in the end,\n\nmean that a school could never meaningfully provide separate\n\nrestrooms and locker rooms on the basis of sex.                                    Biological\n\n\n                                           65\n\fmales     and    females     whose   gender    identity     aligned    would   be\n\nrequired to use the same restrooms and locker rooms as persons\n\nof the opposite biological sex whose gender identity did not\n\nalign.     With such mixed use of separate facilities, no purpose\n\nwould be gained by designating a separate use “on the basis of\n\nsex,” and privacy concerns would be left unaddressed.\n\n      Moreover, enforcement of any separation would be virtually\n\nimpossible.        Basing restroom access on gender identity would\n\nrequire schools to assume gender identity based on appearances,\n\nsocial expectations, or explicit declarations of identity, which\n\nthe     government      concedes     would     render   Title    IX      and   its\n\nregulations nonsensical:\n\n      Certainly a school that has created separate restrooms\n      for boys and girls could not decide that only students\n      who dress, speak, and act sufficiently masculine count\n      as boys entitled to use the boys’ restroom, or that\n      only students who wear dresses, have long hair, and\n      act sufficiently feminine may use the girls’ restroom.\n\nYet, by interpreting Title IX and the regulations as “requiring\n\nschools     to     treat     students     consistent      with   their     gender\n\nidentity,”       and   by   disallowing    schools   from   treating     students\n\nbased on their biological sex, the government’s position would\n\nhave precisely the effect the government finds to be at odds\n\nwith common sense.\n\n      Finally, in arguing that he should not be assigned to the\n\ngirls’ restrooms, G.G. states that “it makes no sense to place a\n\n\n\n\n                                          66\n\ftransgender boy in the girls’ restroom in the name of protecting\n\nstudent privacy” because “girls objected to his presence in the\n\ngirls’ restrooms because they perceived him as male.”                               But the\n\nsame argument applies to his use of the boys’ restrooms, where\n\nboys felt uncomfortable because they perceived him as female.\n\nIn any scenario based on gender identity, moreover, there would\n\nbe no accommodation for the recognized need for physiological\n\nprivacy.\n\n     In    short,       it     is    impossible     to    determine        how    G.G.,    the\n\ngovernment, and the majority would apply the provisions of Title\n\nIX   and    the        implementing       regulations           that      allow    for     the\n\nseparation of living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and\n\nshower facilities “on the basis of sex” if “sex” means gender\n\nidentity.\n\n     The Office for Civil Rights letter, on which the majority\n\nexclusively relies, hardly provides an answer.                            In one sentence\n\nit   states       that       schools     “generally           must    treat      transgender\n\nstudents consistent with their gender identity,” whatever that\n\nmeans,     and    in     the    next    sentence,        it    encourages        schools    to\n\nprovide     “gender-neutral,            individual-user              facilities     to     any\n\nstudent     who     does       not     want    to    use        shared     sex-segregated\n\nfacilities.”           While the first sentence might be impossible to\n\nenforce without destroying all privacy-serving separation, the\n\nsecond     sentence       encourages      schools,        such       as   Gloucester      High\n\n\n                                              67\n\fSchool,      to   provide    unisex      single-stall           restrooms     for   any\n\nstudents who are uncomfortable with sex-separated facilities, as\n\nthe school in fact provided.\n\n      As it stands, Title IX and its implementing regulations\n\nauthorize     schools   to     separate,      on    the    basis     of    sex,   living\n\nfacilities,       restrooms,    locker     rooms,         and    shower    facilities,\n\nwhich must allow for separation on the basis of biological sex.\n\nGloucester High School thus clearly complied with the statute\n\nand   regulations.          But,   as   it    did     so,       it   was   nonetheless\n\nsensitive to G.G.’s gender transition, accommodating virtually\n\nevery wish that he had.            Indeed, he initially requested and was\n\ngranted the use of the nurse’s restroom.                    And, after both girls\n\nand boys objected to his using the girls’ and boys’ restrooms,\n\nthe school provided individual unisex restrooms, as encouraged\n\nby the letter from the Office for Civil Rights.                            Thus, while\n\nGloucester High School made a good-faith effort to accommodate\n\nG.G. and help him in his transition, balancing its concern for\n\nhim with its responsibilities to all students, it still acted\n\nlegally in maintaining a policy that provided all students with\n\nphysiological privacy and safety in restrooms and locker rooms.\n\n      Because the Gloucester County School Board did not violate\n\nTitle   IX    and   Regulation      106.33     in    adopting        the   policy   for\n\nseparate restrooms and locker rooms, I would affirm the district\n\n\n\n\n                                         68\n\fcourt’s decision dismissing G.G.’s Title IX claim and therefore\n\ndissent.\n\n       I also dissent from the majority’s decision to vacate the\n\ndistrict     court’s      denial          of    G.G.’s         motion      for    a     preliminary\n\ninjunction.       As    the   Supreme           Court         has    consistently        explained,\n\n“[a]   preliminary        injunction            is       an    extraordinary          remedy”    that\n\n“may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is\n\nentitled     to    such    relief,”            and       “‘[i]n      exercising       their     sound\n\ndiscretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for\n\nthe public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy.’”\n\nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22-24 (2008)\n\n(quoting      Weinberger           v.     Romero-Barcelo,               456      U.S.    305,    312\n\n(1982)).       Given the facts that the district court fully and\n\nfairly      summarized        in    its        opinion,             including     the     hardships\n\nexpressed both by G.G. and by other students, I cannot conclude\n\nthat we can “form a definite and firm conviction that the court\n\nbelow committed a clear error of judgment,” Morris v.

After G.G. began to use the boys’ restrooms\n\nwith the approval of the school administration, the local school\n\nboard   passed     a     policy       banning       G.G.   from   the    boys’         restroom.\n\nG.G. alleges that the school board impermissibly discriminated\n\nagainst him in violation of Title IX and the Equal Protection\n\nClause of the Constitution.                   The district court dismissed G.G.’s\n\nTitle     IX    claim     and        denied    his     request     for       a    preliminary\n\ninjunction.        This        appeal    followed.         Because      we       conclude     the\n\ndistrict       court    did     not     accord       appropriate     deference           to   the\n\nrelevant       Department       of    Education       regulations,       we       reverse     its\n\ndismissal of G.G.’s Title IX claim.                        Because we conclude that\n\nthe   district         court    used     the     wrong     evidentiary           standard      in\n\nassessing G.G.’s motion for a preliminary injunction, we vacate\n\nits   denial      and     remand       for     consideration       under         the    correct\n\nstandard.        We therefore reverse in part, vacate in part, and\n\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n                                               I.\n\n      At the heart of this appeal is whether Title IX requires\n\nschools    to    provide        transgender          students     access         to    restrooms\n\ncongruent with their gender identity.                       Title IX provides: “[n]o\n\n\n                                                5\n\fperson    .    .     .    shall,    on    the    basis      of    sex,       be    excluded        from\n\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n\ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving\n\nFederal       financial         assistance.”           20    U.S.C.          §    1681(a).          The\n\nDepartment           of        Education’s        (the       Department)               regulations\n\nimplementing Title IX permit the provision of “separate toilet,\n\nlocker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such\n\nfacilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable\n\nto such facilities for students of the other sex.”                                     34 C.F.R. §\n\n106.33.        In        an    opinion    letter      dated       January         7,    2015,       the\n\nDepartment’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) interpreted how this\n\nregulation         should       apply     to    transgender           individuals:           “When   a\n\nschool elects to separate or treat students differently on the\n\nbasis of sex . . . a school generally must treat transgender\n\nstudents       consistent          with    their      gender      identity.”                J.A.   55.\n\nBecause       this       case    comes     to    us   after       dismissal         pursuant         to\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the facts below are\n\ngenerally as stated in G.G.’s complaint.\n\n\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       G.G.     is       a    transgender       boy    now       in    his       junior     year     at\n\nGloucester High School.                  G.G.’s birth-assigned sex, or so-called\n\n“biological sex,” is female, but G.G.’s gender identity is male.\n\nG.G.     has    been          diagnosed    with       gender          dysphoria,        a    medical\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fcondition      characterized   by    clinically       significant     distress\n\ncaused by an incongruence between a person’s gender identity and\n\nthe person’s birth-assigned sex.           Since the end of his freshman\n\nyear, G.G. has undergone hormone therapy and has legally changed\n\nhis name to G., a traditionally male name.                   G.G. lives all\n\naspects of his life as a boy.             G.G. has not, however, had sex\n\nreassignment surgery. 1\n\n     Before beginning his sophomore year, G.G. and his mother\n\ntold school officials that G.G. was a transgender boy.                     The\n\nofficials were supportive and took steps to ensure that he would\n\nbe treated as a boy by teachers and staff.                  Later, at G.G.’s\n\nrequest,      school   officials    allowed    G.G.    to    use    the   boys’\n\nrestroom. 2     G.G. used this restroom without incident for about\n\nseven weeks.      G.G.’s use of the boys’ restroom, however, excited\n\nthe interest of others in the community, some of whom contacted\n\n\n\n\n     1 The World Professional Association for Transgender Health\n(WPATH) has established Standards of Care for individuals with\ngender dysphoria.    J.A. 37.     These Standards of Care are\naccepted as authoritative by organizations such as the American\nMedical Association and the American Psychological Association.\nId. The WPATH Standards of Care do not permit sex reassignment\nsurgery for persons who are under the legal age of majority.\nJ.A. 38.\n\n     2  G.G. does not participate in the school’s physical\neducation programs. He does not seek here, and never has sought,\nuse of the boys’ locker room. Only restroom use is at issue in\nthis case.\n\n\n\n                                      7\n\fthe Gloucester County School Board (the Board) seeking to bar\n\nG.G. from continuing to use the boys’ restroom.\n\n      Board Member Carla B. Hook (Hook) added an item to the\n\nagenda     for   the    November    11,     2014     board    meeting        titled\n\n“Discussion of Use of Restrooms/Locker Room Facilities.”                      J.A.\n\n15.      Hook proposed the following resolution (hereinafter the\n\n“transgender restroom policy” or “the policy”):\n\n            Whereas the GCPS [i.e., Gloucester County\n            Public   Schools]  recognizes  that   some\n            students question their gender identities,\n            and\n\n            Whereas the GCPS encourages such students to\n            seek support, advice, and guidance from\n            parents, professionals and other trusted\n            adults, and\n\n            Whereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe\n            learning environment for all students and to\n            protect   the  privacy   of   all  students,\n            therefore\n\n            It shall be the practice of the GCPS to\n            provide male and female restroom and locker\n            room facilities in its schools, and the use\n            of said facilities shall be limited to the\n            corresponding    biological    genders,    and\n            students with gender identity issues shall\n            be   provided   an   alternative   appropriate\n            private facility.\n\nJ.A. 15-16; 58.\n\n      At the November 11, 2014 meeting twenty-seven people spoke\n\nduring    the    Citizens’   Comment       Period,    a   majority      of    whom\n\nsupported    Hook’s    proposed    resolution.       Many    of   the   speakers\n\ndisplayed hostility to G.G., including by referring pointedly to\n\n\n                                       8\n\fhim as a “young lady.”        J.A. 16.         Others claimed that permitting\n\nG.G. to use the boys’ restroom would violate the privacy of\n\nother students and would lead to sexual assault in restrooms.\n\nOne commenter suggested that if the proposed policy were not\n\nadopted,    non-transgender        boys   would     come      to   school   wearing\n\ndresses in order to gain access to the girls’ restrooms.                      G.G.\n\nand his parents spoke against the proposed policy.                     Ultimately,\n\nthe Board postponed a vote on the policy until its next meeting\n\non December 9, 2014.\n\n     At     the   December    9    meeting,       approximately       thirty-seven\n\npeople spoke during the Citizens’ Comment Period.                     Again, most\n\nof those who spoke were in favor of the proposed resolution.\n\nSome speakers threatened to vote the Board members out of office\n\nif   the    Board   members       voted       against   the    proposed     policy.\n\nSpeakers again referred to G.G. as a “girl” or “young lady.”\n\nJ.A. 18.     One speaker called G.G. a “freak” and compared him to\n\na person who thinks he is a “dog” and wants to urinate on fire\n\nhydrants.     Id.   Following this second comment period, the Board\n\nvoted 6-1 to adopt the proposed policy, thereby barring G.G.\n\nfrom using the boys’ restroom at school.\n\n     G.G. alleges that he cannot use the girls’ restroom because\n\nwomen and girls in those facilities “react[] negatively because\n\nthey perceive[] G.G. to be a boy.”                  Id.       Further, using the\n\ngirls’ restroom would “cause severe psychological distress” to\n\n\n                                          9\n\fG.G. and would be incompatible with his treatment for gender\n\ndysphoria.       J.A. 19.           As a corollary to the policy, the Board\n\nannounced    a    series       of    updates       to    the     school’s    restrooms      to\n\nimprove general privacy for all students, including adding or\n\nexpanding partitions between urinals in male restrooms, adding\n\nprivacy strips to the doors of stalls in all restrooms, and\n\nconstructing       single-stall         unisex          restrooms    available      to     all\n\nstudents.        G.G. alleges that he cannot use these new unisex\n\nrestrooms because they “make him feel even more stigmatized . .\n\n. .   Being required to use the separate restrooms sets him apart\n\nfrom his peers, and serves as a daily reminder that the school\n\nviews him as ‘different.’”                   Id.         G.G. further alleges that,\n\nbecause of this stigma and exclusion, his social transition is\n\nundermined and he experiences “severe and persistent emotional\n\nand social harms.”         Id.       G.G. avoids using the restroom while at\n\nschool   and      has,    as    a     result       of     this    avoidance,       developed\n\nmultiple urinary tract infections.\n\n\n\n                                              B.\n\n      G.G.   sued    the       Board    on    June       11,     2015.      G.G.   seeks    an\n\ninjunction allowing him to use the boys’ restroom and brings\n\nunderlying       claims    that      the     Board       impermissibly       discriminated\n\nagainst him in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments\n\nAct of 1972 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.\n\n\n                                              10\n\fOn July 27, 2015, the district court held a hearing on G.G.’s\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction and on the Board’s motion to\n\ndismiss   G.G.’s     lawsuit.         At    the   hearing,   the   district   court\n\norally dismissed G.G.’s Title IX claim and denied his request\n\nfor a preliminary injunction, but withheld ruling on the motion\n\nto dismiss G.G.’s equal protection claim.                     The district court\n\nfollowed its ruling from the bench with a written order dated\n\nSeptember 4, 2015 denying the injunction and a second written\n\norder dated September 17, 2015 dismissing G.G.’s Title IX claim\n\nand expanding on its rationale for denying the injunction.\n\n     In     its    September      17,      2015   order,     the   district   court\n\nreasoned that Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of\n\nsex and not on the basis of other concepts such as gender,\n\ngender    identity,      or    sexual      orientation.      The   district   court\n\nobserved that the regulations implementing Title IX specifically\n\nallow schools to provide separate restrooms on the basis of sex.\n\nThe district court concluded that G.G.’s sex was female and that\n\nrequiring    him    to   use    the     female    restroom   facilities   did   not\n\nimpermissibly discriminate against him on the basis of sex in\n\nviolation of Title IX.            With respect to G.G.’s request for an\n\ninjunction, the district court found that G.G. had not made the\n\nrequired showing that the balance of equities was in his favor.\n\nThe district court found that requiring G.G. to use the unisex\n\nrestrooms during the pendency of this lawsuit was not unduly\n\n\n                                            11\n\fburdensome     and   would    result   in    less    hardship      than    requiring\n\nother     students   made    uncomfortable     by    G.G.’s       presence    in    the\n\nboys’ restroom to themselves use the unisex restrooms.\n\n      This appeal followed.         G.G. asks us to reverse the district\n\ncourt’s dismissal of his Title IX claim, grant the injunction he\n\nseeks,     and,   because    of   comments    made     by   the    district    judge\n\nduring the motion hearing, to assign the case to a different\n\ndistrict judge on remand.          The Board, on the other hand, asks us\n\nto   affirm   the    district     court’s    rulings    and   also     asks    us    to\n\ndismiss     G.G.’s   equal    protection     claim—on       which    the     district\n\ncourt has yet to rule—as without merit.                 The United States, as\n\nit did below, has filed an amicus brief supporting G.G.’s Title\n\nIX claim in order to defend the government’s interpretation of\n\nTitle IX as requiring schools to provide transgender students\n\naccess to restrooms congruent with their gender identity.\n\n\n\n                                       II.\n\n      We turn first to the district court’s dismissal of G.G.’s\n\nTitle IX claim. 3     We review de novo the district court’s grant of\n\n\n\n\n      3We decline the Board’s invitation to preemptively dismiss\nG.G.’s equal protection claim before it has been fully\nconsidered by the district court. “[W]e are a court of review,\nnot of first view.” Decker v.

For example, Title IX permits the provision of\n\n\n\n           student, a recipient shall not, on the basis\n           of sex:\n\n           (1)   Treat  one  person  differently from\n           another in determining whether such person\n           satisfies any requirement or condition for\n           the provision of such aid, benefit, or\n           service;\n\n           (2) Provide different aid, benefits,        or\n           services   or  provide   aid,   benefits,   or\n           services in a different manner;\n\n           (3) Deny any person any such aid, benefit,\n           or service;\n\n           . . .\n\n           (7) Otherwise limit any person in the\n           enjoyment    of    any   right, privilege,\n           advantage, or opportunity.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b).     We have little difficulty concluding\nthat access to a restroom at a school, under this regulation,\ncan be considered either an “aid, benefit, or service” or a\n“right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity,”      which, when\noffered by a recipient institution, falls within the meaning of\n“educational program” as used in Title IX and defined by the\nDepartment’s implementing regulations.\n\n\n\n                                14\n\fseparate    living      facilities    on      the    basis      of     sex:    “nothing\n\ncontained   [in    Title    IX]    shall     be     construed     to    prohibit       any\n\neducational   institution         receiving       funds   under      this     Act,    from\n\nmaintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.”\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1686.          The Department’s regulations implementing\n\nTitle IX permit the provision of “separate toilet, locker room,\n\nand shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities\n\nprovided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such\n\nfacilities provided for students of the other sex.”                           34 C.F.R.\n\n§ 106.33.         The    Department        recently       delineated          how     this\n\nregulation should be applied to transgender individuals.                             In an\n\nopinion letter dated January 7, 2015, the Department’s Office\n\nfor Civil Rights (OCR) wrote: “When a school elects to separate\n\nor treat students differently on the basis of sex . . . a school\n\ngenerally must treat transgender students consistent with their\n\ngender identity.” 5      J.A. 55.\n\n\n     5 The opinion letter cites to OCR’s December 2014 “Questions\nand Answers on Title IX and Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary\nClasses and Extracurricular Activities.” This document, denoted\na “significant guidance document” per Office of Management and\nBudget regulations, states: “All students, including transgender\nstudents and students who do not conform to sex stereotypes, are\nprotected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX.

Auer requires that an agency’s interpretation of its\n\nown ambiguous regulation be given controlling weight unless the\n\ninterpretation     is    plainly     erroneous    or    inconsistent       with    the\n\nregulation or statute.

An\n\ninterpretation may not be the result of the agency’s fair and\n\nconsidered judgment, and will not be accorded Auer deference,\n\nwhen the interpretation conflicts with a prior interpretation,\n\nwhen   it    appears    that   the   interpretation         is     no   more   than    a\n\n\n\n\navailable    at    http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs\n/faqs-title-ix-single-sex-201412.pdf.\n\n     The dissent suggests that we ignore the part of OCR’s\nopinion letter in which the agency “also encourages schools to\noffer the use of gender-neutral, individual-user facilities to\nany student who does not want to use shared sex-segregated\nfacilities,” as the Board did here.     Post at 66.    However,\nbecause G.G. does want to use shared sex-segregated facilities,\nthe agency’s suggestion regarding students who do not want to\nuse such shared sex-segregated facilities is immaterial to the\nresolution of G.G.’s claim.       Nothing in today’s opinion\nrestricts any school’s ability to provide individual-user\nfacilities.\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\fconvenient litigating position, or when the interpretation is a\n\npost    hoc   rationalization.

The    plainness        or    ambiguity      of    language        is\n\ndetermined by reference to (1) the language itself,                                    (2) the\n\nspecific context in which that language is used, and (3) the\n\nbroader context of the statute or regulation as a whole.

Second, in the specific context of\n\n§ 106.33, the plain meaning of the regulatory language is best\n\nstated by the United States: “the mere act of providing separate\n\nrestroom facilities for males and females does not violate Title\n\nIX . . . .”        U.S. Br. 22 n.8.         Third, the language “of one sex”\n\nand “of the other sex” appears repeatedly in the broader context\n\nof 34 C.F.R. § 106 Subpart D, titled “Discrimination on the\n\nBasis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Prohibited.” 6\n\nThis repeated formulation indicates two sexes (“one sex” and\n\n“the       other   sex”),   and     the    only    reasonable     reading   of   the\n\nlanguage used throughout the relevant regulatory section is that\n\nit references male and female.                    Read plainly then, § 106.33\n\npermits schools to provide separate toilet, locker room, and\n\nshower       facilities     for    its     male   and    female   students.       By\n\n       6For example, § 106.32(b)(2) provides that “[h]ousing\nprovided . . .   to students of one sex, when compared to that\nprovided to students of the other sex, shall be as a whole:\nproportionate in quantity . . . and [c]omparable in quality and\ncost   to  the  student”;   §  106.37(a)(3)  provides   that an\ninstitution generally cannot “[a]pply any rule . . . concerning\neligibility [for financial assistance] which treats persons of\none sex differently from persons of the other sex with regard to\nmarital or parental status”; and § 106.41(b) provides that\n“where [an institution] operates or sponsors a team in a\nparticular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors\nno such team for members of the other sex . . . members of the\nexcluded sex must be allowed to try-out for the team offered . .\n. .”\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\fimplication,       the     regulation         also     permits      schools      to    exclude\n\nmales from the female facilities and vice-versa.\n\n        Our inquiry is not ended, however, by this straightforward\n\nconclusion.       Although the regulation may refer unambiguously to\n\nmales    and    females,        it    is     silent    as    to   how    a    school    should\n\ndetermine whether a transgender individual is a male or female\n\nfor    the     purpose    of    access        to    sex-segregated           restrooms.        We\n\nconclude that the regulation is susceptible to more than one\n\nplausible reading because it permits both the Board’s reading—\n\ndetermining maleness or femaleness with reference exclusively to\n\ngenitalia—and            the         Department’s           interpretation—determining\n\nmaleness or femaleness with reference to gender identity.

It       sheds    little      light      on   how    exactly   to\n\ndetermine the “character of being either male or female” where\n\nthose indicators diverge.                   We conclude that the Department’s\n\ninterpretation of how § 106.33 and its underlying assumptions\n\nshould apply to transgender individuals is not plainly erroneous\n\nor inconsistent with the text of the regulation.                             The regulation\n\nis silent as to which restroom transgender individuals are to\n\nuse when a school elects to provide sex-segregated restrooms,\n\nand the Department’s interpretation, although perhaps not the\n\nintuitive       one,      is        permitted       by        the     varying     physical,\n\npsychological, and social aspects—or, in the words of an older\n\n\n\n\n       7\n       Modern definitions of “sex” also implicitly recognize the\nlimitations of a nonmalleable, binary conception of sex.     For\nexample, Black’s Law Dictionary defines “sex” as “[t]he sum of\nthe peculiarities of structure and function that distinguish a\nmale from a female organism; gender.”     Black’s Law Dictionary\n1583 (10th ed. 2014). The American Heritage Dictionary includes\nin the definition of “sex” “[o]ne’s identity as either female or\nmale.” American Heritage Dictionary 1605 (5th ed. 2011).\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\fdictionary,      “the      morphological,        physiological,          and    behavioral\n\npeculiarities”—included in the term “sex.”\n\n\n\n                                            D.\n\n       Finally,         we      consider         whether           the         Department’s\n\ninterpretation of § 106.33 is the result of the agency’s fair\n\nand considered judgment.            Even a valid interpretation will not\n\nbe   accorded       Auer     deference    where    it     conflicts       with     a    prior\n\ninterpretation, where it appears that the interpretation is no\n\nmore    than    a     convenient     litigating         position,         or    where     the\n\ninterpretation is a post hoc rationalization.                         Christopher, 132\n\nS. Ct. at 2166 (citations omitted).\n\n       Although the Department’s interpretation is novel because\n\nthere    was    no    interpretation       as    to    how    §    106.33       applied    to\n\ntransgender individuals before January 2015, “novelty alone is\n\nno reason to refuse deference” and does not render the current\n\ninterpretation        inconsistent        with    prior      agency      practice.

As the United States explains, the issue in this case\n\n“did not arise until recently,” see id., because schools have\n\nonly    recently      begun      citing     §    106.33      as     justification         for\n\nenacting new policies restricting transgender students’ access\n\nto restroom facilities.             The Department contends that “[i]t is\n\nto      those       ‘newfound’      policies          that        [the     Department’s]\n\n\n                                            24\n\finterpretation of the regulation responds.”                      U.S. Br. 29.        We\n\nsee no reason to doubt this explanation.                       See Talk Am., Inc.,\n\n131 S. Ct. at 2264.\n\n     Nor is the interpretation merely a convenient litigating\n\nposition.        The    Department        has     consistently         enforced    this\n\nposition since 2014.        See J.A. 55 n.5 & n.6 (providing examples\n\nof OCR enforcement actions to secure transgender students access\n\nto restrooms congruent with their gender identities).                         Finally,\n\nthis interpretation cannot properly be considered a post hoc\n\nrationalization        because     it     is     in     line   with     the     existing\n\nguidances and regulations of a number of federal agencies—all of\n\nwhich provide that transgender individuals should be permitted\n\naccess   to     the    restroom    that        corresponds      with    their     gender\n\nidentities. 8     U.S. Br. 17 n.5 & n.6 (citing publications by the\n\nOccupational      Safety     and        Health        Administration,     the     Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Housing and\n\n     8 We disagree with the dissent’s suggestion that the result\nwe reach today renders the enforcement of separate restroom\nfacilities impossible because it “would require schools to\nassume   gender    identity   based   on   appearances,   social\nexpectations, or explicit declarations of identity.”     Post at\n65.   Accepting the Board’s position would equally require the\nschool to assume “biological sex” based on “appearances, social\nexpectations, or explicit declarations of [biological sex].”\nCertainly, no one is suggesting mandatory verification of the\n“correct” genitalia before admittance to a restroom.         The\nDepartment’s vision of sex-segregated restrooms which takes\naccount of gender identity presents no greater “impossibility of\nenforcement” problem than does the Board’s “biological gender”\nvision of sex-segregated restrooms.\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\fUrban      Development,   and    the    Office   of   Personnel    Management).\n\nNone of the Christopher grounds for withholding Auer deference\n\nare present in this case.\n\n\n\n                                           E.\n\n      We conclude that the Department’s interpretation of its own\n\nregulation,       §   106.33,   as    it   relates    to   restroom   access    by\n\ntransgender individuals, is entitled to Auer deference and is to\n\nbe accorded controlling weight in this case. 9                 We reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s contrary conclusion and its resultant dismissal\n\nof G.G.’s Title IX claim.\n\n\n\n                                           F.\n\n        In many respects, we are in agreement with the dissent.                We\n\nagree that “sex” should be construed uniformly throughout Title\n\nIX   and    its   implementing       regulations.

Although we recognize\nthat the Johnston court confronted a case similar in most\nmaterial facts to the one before us, that court did not consider\nthe Department’s interpretation     of § 106.33.      Because the\nJohnston   court  did   not  grapple   with   the   questions  of\nadministrative law implicated here, we find the Title IX\nanalysis in Johnston to be unpersuasive.\n\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\frestrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities on the basis of\n\nsex.        We   agree    that    “an    individual    has   a    legitimate    and\n\nimportant interest in bodily privacy such that his or her nude\n\nor partially nude body, genitalia, and other private parts” are\n\nnot involuntarily exposed. 10            Post at 56.    It is not apparent to\n\nus, however, that the truth of these propositions undermines the\n\nconclusion we reach regarding the level of deference due to the\n\nDepartment’s interpretation of its own regulations.\n\n       The Supreme Court commands the use of particular analytical\n\nframeworks       when    courts    review    the   actions   of    the   executive\n\nagencies.        G.G. claims that he is entitled to use the boys’\n\nrestroom     pursuant     to     the    Department’s   interpretation      of   its\n\nregulations implementing Title IX.                 We have carefully followed\n\nthe Supreme Court’s guidance in Chevron, Auer, and Christopher\n\nand have determined that the interpretation contained in the OCR\n\nletter is to be accorded controlling weight.                 In a case such as\n\n\n       10\n       We doubt that G.G.’s use of the communal restroom of his\nchoice threatens the type of constitutional abuses present in\nthe cases cited by the dissent.

Courts must, in some cases,\n            reconcile competing political interests, but\n            not on the basis of the judges' personal\n            policy preferences. In contrast, an agency\n            to which Congress has delegated policy-\n            making   responsibilities    may,    within   the\n            limits of that delegation, properly rely\n            upon the incumbent administration's views of\n            wise policy to inform its judgments. While\n            agencies are not directly accountable to the\n            people, the Chief Executive is, and it is\n            entirely   appropriate   for    this    political\n            branch of the Government to make such policy\n            choices—resolving the competing interests\n\n     11 The dissent accepts the Board’s invocation of amorphous\nsafety concerns as a reason for refusing deference to the\nDepartment’s interpretation. We note that the record is devoid\nof any evidence tending to show that G.G.’s use of the boys’\nrestroom creates a safety issue.    We also note that the Board\nhas been, perhaps deliberately, vague as to the nature of the\nsafety concerns it has—whether it fears that it cannot ensure\nG.G.’s safety while in the restroom or whether it fears G.G.\nhimself is a threat to the safety of others in the restroom. We\nare unconvinced of the existence of danger caused by “sexual\nresponses prompted by students’ exposure to the private body\nparts of students of the other biological sex.”      Post at 58.\nThe same safety concern would seem to require segregated\nrestrooms for gay boys and girls who would, under the dissent’s\nformulation, present a safety risk because of the “sexual\nresponses prompted” by their exposure to the private body parts\nof other students of the same sex in sex-segregated restrooms.\n\n\n\n                                       28\n\f             which Congress itself either inadvertently\n             did not resolve, or intentionally left to be\n             resolved by the agency charged with the\n             administration of the statute in light of\n             everyday realities.\n\n\nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

Thus,     although\n\nadmissible    evidence    may    be    more      persuasive      than   inadmissible\n\nevidence in the preliminary injunction context, it was error for\n\n\n\n                                        31\n\fthe district court to summarily reject G.G.’s proffered evidence\n\nbecause it may have been inadmissible at a subsequent trial.\n\n      Additionally, the district court completely excluded some\n\nof G.G.’s proffered evidence on hearsay grounds.

Because        preliminary            injunction        proceedings      are\n\ninformal    ones     designed       to   prevent       irreparable        harm    before     a\n\nlater trial     governed       by    the    full       rigor    of    usual    evidentiary\n\nstandards,     district        courts       may        look     to,     and     indeed      in\n\nappropriate circumstances rely on, hearsay or other inadmissible\n\nevidence     when    deciding       whether       a    preliminary        injunction        is\n\nwarranted.\n\n     Because        the   district       court        evaluated       G.G.’s     proffered\n\nevidence     against      a    stricter         evidentiary          standard     than      is\n\nwarranted by the nature and purpose of preliminary injunction\n\nproceedings to prevent irreparable harm before a full trial on\n\nthe merits, the district court was “guided by erroneous legal\n\nprinciples.”         We   therefore        conclude      that     the    district      court\n\nabused   its   discretion        when      it    denied        G.G.’s    request      for    a\n\npreliminary     injunction          without       considering         G.G.’s     proffered\n\nevidence.      We     vacate    the      district       court’s       denial     of   G.G.’s\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction and remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court for consideration of G.G.’s evidence in light of\n\nthe evidentiary standards set forth herein.\n\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f                                               IV.\n\n       Finally,      G.G.    requests         that    we   reassign     this     case   to    a\n\ndifferent district judge on remand.

He contends that the district court has\n\npre-existing views which it would be unwilling to put aside in\n\nthe face of contrary evidence about medical science generally\n\nand about “gender and sexuality in particular.”                           Appellant’s Br.\n\n\n                                                34\n\f53.    For    example,    the    court    accepted   the    Board’s    “mating”\n\nconcern by noting:\n\n             There    are    only    two    instincts—two.\n             Everything   else    is  acquired—everything.\n             That is, the brain only has two instincts.\n             One is called self-preservation, and the\n             other is procreation.     And procreation is\n             the highest instinct in individuals who are\n             in the latter part of their teen-age years.\n             All of that is accepted by all medical\n             science, as far as I can determine in\n             reading information.\n\nJ.A. 85-86.\n\n      The district court also expressed skepticism that medical\n\nscience   supported      the    proposition   that   one    could     develop   a\n\nurinary tract infection from withholding urine for too long.\n\nJ.A. 111-12.     The district court characterized gender dysphoria\n\nas a “mental disorder” and resisted several attempts by counsel\n\nfor G.G. to clarify that it only becomes a disorder when left\n\nuntreated.      See J.A. 88-91; 101-02.          The district court also\n\nseemed to reject G.G.’s representation of what it meant to be\n\ntransgender, repeatedly noting that G.G. “wants” to be a boy and\n\nnot a girl, but that “he is biologically a female.”                   J.A. 103-\n\n04; see also J.A. 104 (“It’s his mind. It’s not physical that\n\ncauses that, it’s what he believes.”).               The district court’s\n\nmemorandum    opinion,    however,    included   none      of   the   extraneous\n\nremarks or suppositions that marred the hearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\f     Reassignment      is   an   unusual   step   at   this   early   stage   of\n\nlitigation.     Although the district court did express opinions\n\nabout medical facts and skepticism of G.G.’s claims, the record\n\ndoes not clearly indicate that the district judge would refuse\n\nto   consider   and    credit     sound    contrary    evidence.      Further,\n\nalthough the district court has a distinct way of proceeding in\n\ncourt, the hearing record and the district court’s written order\n\nin the case do not raise in our minds a question about the\n\nfundamental fairness of the proceedings, however idiosyncratic.\n\nThe conduct of the district judge does not at this point satisfy\n\nthe Guglielmi standard.          We deny G.G.’s request for reassignment\n\nto a different district judge on remand.\n\n\n\n                                      V.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is\n\n                      REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      36\n\fDAVIS, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n     I     concur       in    Judge        Floyd’s   fine     opinion.

See J.A.\n\n32–33.    His    affidavit       also   indicates    that    he    has      “repeatedly\n\ndeveloped       painful    urinary      tract    infections”      as    a    result   of\n\nholding    his    urine     in   order      to   avoid    using   the    restroom     at\n\nschool.    Id.\n\n     An expert declaration by Dr. Randi Ettner, a psychologist\n\nspecializing       in     working    with    children      and    adolescents     with\n\ngender dysphoria, provides further support for G.G.’s claim of\n\nirreparable harm.          In her affidavit, Dr. Ettner indicates that\n\ntreating a transgender boy as male in some situations but not in\n\nothers is “inconsistent with evidence-based medical practice and\n\n\n                                            38\n\fdetrimental       to   the    health      and       well-being      of     the    child”       and\n\nexplains why access to a restroom appropriate to one’s gender\n\nidentity is important for transgender youth.                               J.A. 39.          With\n\nrespect to G.G. in particular, Dr. Ettner states that in her\n\nprofessional opinion, the Board’s restroom policy “is currently\n\ncausing emotional distress to an extremely vulnerable youth and\n\nplacing G.G. at risk for accruing lifelong psychological harm.”\n\nJ.A. 41.    In particular, Dr. Ettner opines that\n\n     [a]s a result of the School Board’s restroom policy, .\n     . . G.G. is put in the humiliating position of having\n     to use a separate facility, thereby accentuating his\n     ‘otherness,’ undermining his identity formation, and\n     impeding his medically necessary social transition\n     process.     The shame of being singled out and\n     stigmatized in his daily life every time he needs to\n     use the restroom is a devastating blow to G.G. and\n     places him at extreme risk for immediate and long-term\n     psychological harm.\n\nJ.A. 42.\n\n     The    Board       offers       nothing         to   contradict          any       of     the\n\nassertions concerning irreparable harm in G.G.’s or Dr. Ettner’s\n\naffidavits.       Instead, its arguments focus on what is purportedly\n\nlacking    from    G.G.’s     presentation           in   support        of   his      claim    of\n\nirreparable       harm,      such    as   “evidence          that    [his        feelings       of\n\ndysphoria, anxiety, and distress] would be lessened by using the\n\nboy[s’]    restroom,”        evidence      from        his    treating        psychologist,\n\nmedical     evidence,          and        an        opinion         from         Dr.     Ettner\n\n“differentiating between the distress that G.G. may suffer by\n\n\n\n                                               39\n\fnot    using       the    boy[s’]       bathroom     during        the    course        of    this\n\nlitigation and the distress that he has apparently been living\n\nwith since age 12.”                Br. Appellee 42–43.                As to the alleged\n\ndeficiency concerning Dr. Ettner’s opinion, the Board’s argument\n\nis belied by Dr. Ettner’s affidavit itself, which, as quoted\n\nabove, provides her opinion about the psychological harm that\n\nG.G.    is    experiencing         “[a]s    a    result       of    the    School        Board’s\n\nrestroom policy.”              J.A. 42.    With respect to the other purported\n\ninadequacies,           the    absence    of     such   evidence          does    nothing       to\n\nundermine         the    uncontroverted        statements       concerning         the       daily\n\npsychological harm G.G. experiences as a result of the Board’s\n\npolicy       or    Dr.    Ettner’s       unchallenged         opinion      concerning          the\n\nsignificant long-term consequences of that harm.                               Moreover, the\n\nBoard offers no argument to counter G.G.’s averment that he has\n\nrepeatedly contracted a urinary tract infection as a result of\n\nholding his urine to avoid using the restroom at school.\n\n       The        uncontroverted         facts      before         the     district          court\n\ndemonstrate that as a result of the Board’s restroom policy,\n\nG.G. experiences daily psychological harm that puts him at risk\n\nfor    long-term         psychological      harm,       and    his       avoidance       of    the\n\nrestroom as a result of the Board’s policy puts him at risk for\n\ndeveloping a urinary tract infection as he has repeatedly in the\n\npast.         G.G.       has     thus     demonstrated         that       he     will        suffer\n\nirreparable harm in the absence of an injunction.\n\n\n                                               40\n\f                                          C.\n\n       Turning to the balance of the hardships, G.G. has shown\n\nthat   he   will     suffer   irreparable        harm   without   the   requested\n\ninjunction.        On the other end of the scale, the Board contends\n\nthat other students’ constitutional right to privacy will be\n\nimperiled by G.G.’s presence in the boys’ restroom.\n\n       As   the    majority   opinion     points     out,   G.G.’s   use   of   the\n\nrestroom     does     not     implicate        the   unconstitutional      actions\n\ninvolved in the cases cited by the dissent.                 Moreover, students’\n\nunintentional exposure of their genitals to others using the\n\nrestroom has already been largely, if not entirely, remedied by\n\nthe alterations to the school’s restrooms already undertaken by\n\nthe Board.        To the extent that a student simply objects to using\n\nthe restroom in the presence of a transgender student even where\n\nthere is no possibility that either student’s genitals will be\n\nexposed, all students have access to the single-stall restrooms.\n\nFor other students, using the single-stall restrooms carries no\n\nstigma whatsoever, whereas for G.G., using those same restrooms\n\nis tantamount to humiliation and a continuing mark of difference\n\namong his fellow students.          The minimal or non-existent hardship\n\nto other students of using the single-stall restrooms if they\n\nobject to G.G.’s presence in the communal restroom thus does not\n\ntip the scale in the Board’s favor.                  The balance of hardships\n\nweighs heavily toward G.G.\n\n\n                                          41\n\f                                           D.\n\n       Finally, consideration of the public interest in granting\n\nor    denying    the   preliminary       injunction        favors     G.G.      Having\n\nconcluded that G.G. has demonstrated a likelihood of success on\n\nthe    merits    of    his    Title     IX      claim,    denying     the    requested\n\ninjunction would permit the Board to continue violating G.G.’s\n\nrights under Title IX for the pendency of this case.                         Enforcing\n\nG.G.’s right to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex\n\nin an educational institution is plainly in the public interest.\n\nCf. Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v.

The existence of\n\nproposed legislation that, if passed, would address the question\n\nbefore us does not justify forcing G.G. to suffer irreparable\n\nharm when he has demonstrated that he is likely to succeed on\n\nthe merits of his claims under current federal law.\n\n\n\n\n                                           42\n\f                                             II.\n\n      Based on the evidence presented to the district court, G.G.\n\nhas   satisfied     all    four    prongs         of   the    preliminary     injunction\n\ninquiry.

It is to be hoped that the\n\ndistrict court will turn its attention to this matter with the\n\nurgency    the    case    poses.        Under      the    circumstances       here,       the\n\nappropriateness and necessity of such prompt action is plain.\n\nBy the time the district court issues its decision, G.G. will\n\nhave suffered the psychological harm the injunction sought to\n\nprevent for an entire school year.\n\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\f     With these additional observations, I concur fully in Judge\nFloyd’s   thoughtful  and  thorough   opinion  for   the  panel.\n\n\n\n\n                               44\n\fNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n      I concur in Part IV of the court’s opinion.                            With respect\n\nto whether G.G. stated a claim under Title IX and whether the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying G.G’s motion for\n\na   preliminary       injunction,     I     would   affirm       the    ruling       of    the\n\ndistrict court dismissing G.G.’s Title IX claim and denying his\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction.                    I therefore dissent from\n\nthe majority’s decision on those issues.\n\n      G.G.,     a     transgender         boy     who     is    16,     challenges          as\n\ndiscriminatory, under the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX\n\nof the Education Amendments of 1972, his high school’s policy\n\nfor assigning students to restrooms and locker rooms based on\n\nbiological sex.            The school’s policy provides:                     (1) that the\n\ngirls’   restrooms         and   locker    rooms    are    designated         for    use    by\n\nstudents      who    are     biologically        female;       (2)     that    the    boys’\n\nrestrooms and locker rooms are designated for use by students\n\nwho are biologically male; and (3) that all students, regardless\n\nof their sex, are authorized to use the school’s three single-\n\nstall unisex restrooms, which the school created to accommodate\n\ntransgender         students.        Under       this     policy,       G.G.,       who    is\n\nbiologically female but who identifies as male, is authorized to\n\nuse   the     girls’    restrooms         and    locker    rooms       and    the    unisex\n\nrestrooms.      He contends, however, that the policy discriminates\n\n\n\n                                            45\n\fagainst him because it denies him, as one who identifies as\n\nmale, the use of the boys’ restrooms, and he seeks an injunction\n\ncompelling      the     high    school    to     allow    him    to     use    the       boys’\n\nrestrooms.\n\n        The    district      court    dismissed         G.G.’s     Title       IX       claim,\n\nexplaining      that     the    school    complied       with    Title        IX       and   its\n\nregulations,      which      permit   schools      to    provide      separate          living\n\nfacilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities “on\n\nthe basis of sex,” so long as the facilities are “comparable.”\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1686; 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.32(b), 106.33.\n\n      Strikingly, the majority now reverses the district court’s\n\nruling, without any supporting case law, and concludes that when\n\nTitle     IX    and    its     regulations       provide     for      separate          living\n\nfacilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities on\n\nthe basis of sex, the statute’s and regulations’ use of the term\n\n“sex”     means    a    person’s      gender      identity,       not    the        person’s\n\nbiological status as male or female.                     To accomplish its goal,\n\nthe   majority        relies   entirely     on    a   2015      letter    sent          by   the\n\nDepartment of Education’s Office for Civil Rights to G.G., in\n\nwhich the Office for Civil Rights stated, “When a school elects\n\nto separate or treat students differently on the basis of sex\n\n[when    providing       restrooms,      locker       rooms,     shower       facilities,\n\nhousing,       athletic      teams,   and      single-sex       classes],          a    school\n\ngenerally must treat transgender students consistent with their\n\n\n                                            46\n\fgender    identity.”           (Emphasis         added).       Accepting        that        new\n\ndefinition of the statutory term “sex,” the majority’s opinion,\n\nfor the first time ever, holds that a public high school may not\n\nprovide   separate       restrooms        and    locker    rooms    on    the       basis    of\n\nbiological sex.          Rather, it must now allow a biological male\n\nstudent who identifies as female to use the girls’ restrooms and\n\nlocker    rooms    and,      likewise,      must       allow   a   biological         female\n\nstudent who identifies as male to use the boys’ restrooms and\n\nlocker    rooms.          This      holding          completely    tramples          on     all\n\nuniversally accepted protections of privacy and safety that are\n\nbased on the anatomical differences between the sexes.                                    And,\n\nunwittingly, it also tramples on the very concerns expressed by\n\nG.G., who said that he should not be forced to go to the girls’\n\nrestrooms      because    of     the   “severe         psychological      distress”          it\n\nwould inflict on him and because female students had “reacted\n\nnegatively”       to   his     presence         in    girls’   restrooms.             Surely\n\nbiological males who identify as females would encounter similar\n\nreactions in the girls’ restroom, just as students physically\n\nexposed   to    students       of   the    opposite       biological      sex       would    be\n\nlikely    to   experience        psychological          distress.         As    a    result,\n\nschools would no longer be able to protect physiological privacy\n\nas between students of the opposite biological sex.\n\n      This unprecedented holding overrules custom, culture, and\n\nthe   very     demands    inherent        in    human     nature    for    privacy          and\n\n\n                                            47\n\fsafety, which the separation of such facilities is designed to\n\nprotect.        More     particularly,              it    also      misconstrues       the     clear\n\nlanguage       of   Title    IX    and        its    regulations.               And   finally,     it\n\nreaches an unworkable and illogical result.\n\n       The recent Office for Civil Rights letter, moreover, which\n\nis not law but which is the only authority on which the majority\n\nrelies,    states        more   than      the       majority        acknowledges.            In   the\n\nsentence following the sentence on which the majority relies,\n\nthe    letter       states     that,     to     accommodate          transgender        students,\n\nschools       are    encouraged         “to    offer          the   use    of    gender-neutral,\n\nindividual-user facilities to any student who does not want to\n\nuse shared sex-segregated facilities [as permitted by Title IX’s\n\nregulations].”           This appears to approve the course that G.G.’s\n\nschool followed when it created unisex restrooms in addition to\n\nthe boys’ and girls’ restrooms it already had.\n\n       Title        IX   and      its         implementing           regulations         are      not\n\nambiguous.          In recognition of physiological privacy and safety\n\nconcerns,       they      allow     schools              to    provide      “separate        living\n\nfacilities for the different sexes,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, provided\n\nthat    the    facilities         are    “proportionate”              and       “comparable,”      34\n\nC.F.R.    §    106.32(b),         and    to     provide         “separate        toilet,     locker\n\nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” again provided\n\nthat     the    facilities         are        “comparable,”           34    C.F.R.      § 106.33.\n\nBecause the school’s policy that G.G. challenges in this action\n\n\n                                                    48\n\fcomports with Title IX and its regulations, I would affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of G.G.’s Title IX claim.\n\n\n                                            I\n\n       The relevant facts are not in dispute.                    G.G. is a 16 year-\n\nold who attends Gloucester High School in Gloucester County,\n\nVirginia.     He is biologically female, but “did not feel like a\n\ngirl” from an early age.              Still, he enrolled at Gloucester High\n\nSchool for his freshman year as a female.\n\n       During his freshman year, however, G.G. told his parents\n\nthat   he    considered         himself    to    be    transgender,         and    shortly\n\nthereafter,     at        his     request,       he     began        therapy       with    a\n\npsychologist,       who        diagnosed   him        with    gender       dysphoria,      a\n\ncondition of distress brought about by the incongruence of one’s\n\nbiological sex and gender identity.\n\n       In August 2014, before beginning his sophomore year, G.G.\n\nand his mother met with the principal and guidance counselor at\n\nGloucester    High    School       to   discuss       his    need,    as   part     of    his\n\ntreatment,     to    socially         transition       at    school.         The    school\n\naccommodated    all       of    his   requests.         Officials      changed      school\n\nrecords to reflect G.G.’s new male name; the guidance counselor\n\nsupported G.G.’s sending an email to teachers explaining that he\n\nwas to be addressed using his new name and to be referred to\n\nusing male pronouns; G.G. was permitted to fulfill his physical\n\n\n\n                                           49\n\feducation        requirement          through      a    home-bound        program,      as     he\n\npreferred not to use the school’s locker rooms; and the school\n\nallowed G.G. to use a restroom in the nurse’s office “because\n\n[he]     was     unsure      how      other      students      would      react    to    [his]\n\ntransition.”           G.G.     was    grateful        for    the   school’s      “welcoming\n\nenvironment.”           As he stated, “no teachers, administrators, or\n\nstaff    at      Gloucester      High      School      expressed     any    resistance        to\n\ncalling [him] by [his] legal name or referring to [him] using\n\nmale pronouns.”              And he was “pleased to discover that [his]\n\nteachers and the vast majority of [his] peers respected the fact\n\nthat [he is] a boy.”\n\n       As      the     school       year      began,      however,        G.G.     found      it\n\n“stigmatizing” to continue using the nurse’s restroom, and he\n\nrequested        to    use    the     boys’      restrooms.         The    principal         also\n\naccommodated this request.                    But the very next day, the School\n\nBoard    began        receiving       “numerous        complaints      from      parents     and\n\nstudents about [G.G.’s] use of the boys’ restrooms.”                              The School\n\nBoard thus faced a dilemma.                    It recognized G.G.’s feelings, as\n\nhe expressed them, that “[u]sing the girls’ restroom[s] [was]\n\nnot possible” because of the “severe psychological distress” it\n\nwould inflict on him and because female students had previously\n\n“reacted negatively” to his presence in the girls’ restrooms.\n\nIt now also had to recognize that boys had similar feelings\n\ncaused      by    G.G.’s     use    of     the    boys’      restrooms,     although         G.G.\n\n\n                                                 50\n\fstated    that    he    continued    using     the    boys’   restrooms       for   some\n\nseven weeks without personally receiving complaints from fellow\n\nstudents.\n\n     The Gloucester County School Board considered the problem\n\nand, after two public meetings, adopted a compromise policy, as\n\nfollows:\n\n     Whereas   the  GCPS   recognizes  that                   some     students\n     question their gender identities, and\n\n     Whereas the GCPS encourages such students                         to seek\n     support,   advice,    and   guidance    from                      parents,\n     professionals and other trusted adults, and\n\n     Whereas the GCPS seeks to provide                     a safe learning\n     environment for all students and                      to protect the\n     privacy of all students, therefore\n\n     It shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide male\n     and female restroom and locker room facilities in its\n     schools, and the use of said facilities shall be\n     limited to the corresponding biological genders, and\n     students with gender identity issues shall be provided\n     an alternative appropriate private facility.\n\nGloucester       High    School     promptly    implemented      the    policy      and\n\ncreated    three       single-stall    unisex        restrooms   for    use    by   all\n\nstudents, regardless of their biological sex or gender identity.\n\n     In December 2014, G.G. sought an opinion letter about his\n\nsituation from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for\n\nCivil Rights, and on January 15, 2015, the Office responded,\n\nstating, as relevant here:\n\n     The Department’s Title IX regulations permit schools\n     to provide sex-segregated restrooms, locker rooms,\n     shower   facilities,  housing,  athletic  teams,  and\n     single-sex classes under certain circumstances.  When\n\n\n                                         51\n\f     a school elects to separate or treat students\n     differently on the basis of sex in those situations, a\n     school generally must treat transgender students\n     consistent with their gender identity.     [The Office\n     for Civil Rights] also encourages schools to offer the\n     use of gender-neutral, individual-user facilities to\n     any student who does not want to use shared sex-\n     segregated facilities.\n\n     G.G. commenced this action in June 2015, alleging that the\n\nGloucester County School Board’s policy was discriminatory, in\n\nviolation of the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause and\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681\n\net seq.    He sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and\n\ndamages.   With his complaint, G.G. also filed a motion for a\n\npreliminary   injunction    “requiring   the   School   Board   to   allow\n\n[him] to use the boys’ restrooms at school.”\n\n     The district court dismissed G.G.’s Title IX claim because\n\nTitle IX’s implementing regulations permit schools to provide\n\nseparate restrooms “on the basis of sex.”        The court also denied\n\nG.G.’s motion for a preliminary injunction.             As to the Equal\n\nProtection claim, the court has not yet ruled on whether G.G.\n\nfailed to state a claim, but, at the hearing on the motion for a\n\npreliminary   injunction,     it   indicated    that    it   “will   hear\n\nevidence” and “get a date set” for trial to better assess the\n\nclaim.\n\n     From the district court’s order denying G.G.’s motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction, G.G. filed this appeal, in which he also\n\n\n\n\n                                   52\n\fchallenges the district court’s Title IX ruling as inextricably\n\nintertwined with the district court’s denial of the motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction.\n\n\n                                                II\n\n     G.G.    recognizes            that   persons          who   are     born    biologically\n\nfemale    “typically”         identify          psychologically           as     female,    and\n\nlikewise,       that        persons       who        are     born      biologically        male\n\n“typically”      identify           as    male.             Because       G.G.     was     born\n\nbiologically     female       but     identifies           as    male,    he    characterizes\n\nhimself as a transgender male.                       He contends that because he is\n\ntransgender, the School Board singled him out for “different and\n\nunequal treatment,” “discriminat[ing] against him based on sex\n\n[by denying him use of the boys’ restrooms], in violation of\n\nTitle    IX.”         He    argues,       “discrimination           against       transgender\n\npeople is necessarily discrimination based on sex because it is\n\nimpossible       to        treat     people          differently         based     on      their\n\ntransgender status without taking their sex into account.”                                   He\n\nconcludes that the School Board’s policy addressing restrooms\n\nand locker rooms thus illegally fails to include transgender\n\npersons on the basis of their gender identity.                                 In particular,\n\nhe concludes that he is “prevent[ed] . . . from using the same\n\nrestrooms as other students and relegat[ed] . . . to separate,\n\nsingle-stall facilities.”\n\n\n\n                                                53\n\f      As noted, the School Board’s policy designates the use of\n\nrestrooms and locker rooms based on the student’s biological sex\n\n-- biological females are assigned to the girls’ restrooms and\n\nunisex restrooms; biological males are assigned to the boys’\n\nrestrooms and unisex restrooms.               G.G. is thus assigned to the\n\ngirls’ restrooms and the unisex restrooms, but is denied the use\n\nof   the   boys’    restrooms.      He    asserts,   however,   that    because\n\nneither he nor the girls would accept his use of the girls’\n\nrestroom,    he    is   relegated   to   the   unisex   restrooms,     which   is\n\nstigmatizing.\n\n      The School Board contends that it is treating all students\n\nthe same way, as it explains:\n\n      The School Board’s policy does not discriminate\n      against any class of students.     Instead, the policy\n      was developed to treat all students and situations the\n      same.    To respect the safety and privacy of all\n      students, the School Board has had a long-standing\n      practice of limiting the use of restroom and locker\n      room facilities to the corresponding biological sex of\n      the students.    The School Board also provides three\n      single-stall   bathrooms  for  any    student   to  use\n      regardless of his or her biological sex.      Under the\n      School Board’s restroom policy, G.G. is being treated\n      like every other student in the Gloucester Schools.\n      All students have two choices. Every student can use\n      a restroom associated with their anatomical sex,\n      whether they are boys or girls.     If students choose\n      not to use the restroom associated with their\n      anatomical sex, the students can use a private,\n      single-stall restroom. No student is permitted to use\n      the restroom of the opposite sex.     As a result, all\n      students, including female to male transgender and\n      male to female transgender students, are treated the\n      same.\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\f       While G.G. has pending a claim under the Equal Protection\n\nClause (on which the district court has not yet ruled), only his\n\npreliminary injunction challenge and Title IX claim are before\n\nus at this time.\n\n       Title IX provides:\n\n       No person in the United States shall, on the basis of\n       sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\n       benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\n       any education program or activity receiving Federal\n       financial assistance . . . .\n\n20   U.S.C.        §   1681(a)    (emphasis   added).          The   Act,    however,\n\nprovides, “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in\n\nthis chapter, nothing contained herein shall be construed to\n\nprohibit any educational institution receiving funds under this\n\nAct,     from      maintaining     separate    living      facilities        for   the\n\ndifferent sexes.”           Id. § 1686 (emphasis added); see also 34\n\nC.F.R.    §     106.32(b)    (permitting      schools     to    provide     “separate\n\nhousing       on    the   basis   of   sex”   as   long    as     the   housing     is\n\n“proportionate” and “comparable” (emphasis added)).                         Similarly,\n\nimplementing Regulation 106.33 provides for particular separate\n\nfacilities, as follows:\n\n       A recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room,\n       and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such\n       facilities provided for students of one sex shall be\n       comparable to such facilities provided for students of\n       the other sex.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 106.33 (emphasis added).                Thus, although Title IX\n\nand its regulations provide generally that a school receiving\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\ffederal funds may not discriminate on the basis of sex, they\n\nalso     specify         that    a   school        does     not    violate       the    Act   by\n\nproviding,          on    the   basis      of    sex,     separate      living    facilities,\n\nrestrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities.\n\n       While G.G. only challenges the definition and application\n\nof the term “sex” with respect to separate restrooms, acceptance\n\nof his argument would necessarily change the definition of “sex”\n\nfor    purposes          of   assigning     separate        living      facilities,      locker\n\nrooms, and shower facilities as well.                        All are based on “sex,” a\n\nterm that must be construed uniformly throughout Title IX and\n\nits implementing regulations.                     See Sullivan v.

Such privacy was and remains necessary because of\n\nthe   inherent    “[p]hysical      differences           between    men   and    women,”\n\nwhich, as the Supreme Court explained, are “enduring” and render\n\n“the two sexes . . . not fungible,” id. at 533 (distinguishing\n\nsex from race and national origin), not because of “one’s sense\n\nof oneself as belonging to a particular gender,” as G.G. and the\n\ngovernment as amicus contend.\n\n      Thus, Title IX’s allowance for the separation, based on\n\nsex, of living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower\n\nfacilities rests on the universally accepted concern for bodily\n\nprivacy that is founded on the biological differences between\n\nthe   sexes.      This    privacy   concern         is    also     linked   to    safety\n\nconcerns   that    could    arise    from     sexual       responses      prompted      by\n\nstudents’ exposure to the private body parts of students of the\n\nother biological sex.        Indeed, the School Board cited these very\n\nreasons    for   its    adoption    of   the    policy,       explaining         that   it\n\nseparates restrooms and locker rooms to promote the privacy and\n\nsafety of minor children, pursuant to its “responsibility to its\n\nstudents   to    ensure    their    privacy     while       engaging      in    personal\n\nbathroom functions, disrobing, dressing, and showering outside\n\nof the presence of members of the opposite sex.                                [That the\n\nschool    has    this    responsibility]       is    particularly         true    in    an\n\n\n\n\n                                         59\n\fenvironment         where     children        are    still       developing,          both\n\nemotionally and physically.”\n\n      The need to protect privacy and safety between the sexes\n\nbased on physical exposure would not be present in the same\n\nquality and degree if the term “sex” were to encompass only a\n\nperson’s     gender      identity.         Indeed,   separation       on   this    basis\n\nwould function nonsensically.                A biological male identifying as\n\nfemale could hardly live in a girls’ dorm or shower in a girls’\n\nshower     without      invading    physiological         privacy    needs,     and    the\n\nsame would hold true for a biological female identifying as male\n\nin a boys’ dorm or shower.                G.G.’s answer, of course, is that he\n\nis   not    challenging       the   separation,      on    the   basis     of   sex,   of\n\nliving facilities, locker rooms, and shower facilities, but only\n\nof restrooms, where the risks to privacy and safety are far\n\nreduced.         This effort to limit the scope of the issue apparently\n\nsways      the    majority,    as    it    cabins    its    entire    discussion       to\n\n“restroom access by transgender individuals.”                       Ante at 26.        But\n\nthis effort to restrict the effect of G.G.’s argument hardly\n\nmatters when the term “sex” would have to be applied uniformly\n\nthroughout        the   statute     and    regulations,     as     noted   above      and,\n\nindeed, as agreed to by the majority.                See ante at 26.\n\n      The        realities    underpinning       Title      IX’s     recognition       of\n\nseparate living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower\n\nfacilities are reflected in the plain language of the statute\n\n\n                                            60\n\fand regulations, which is not ambiguous.                        The text of Title IX\n\nand its regulations allowing for separation of each facility “on\n\nthe   basis    of    sex”    employs       the    term    “sex”      as    was     generally\n\nunderstood at the time of enactment.

Indeed,\n\nalthough the contemporaneous meaning controls our analysis, it\n\nis notable that, even today, the term “sex” continues to be\n\ndefined based on the physiological distinctions between males\n\nand females.         See, e.g., Webster’s New World College Dictionary\n\n1331   (5th    ed.    2014)      (“either      of     the    two    divisions,       male    or\n\nfemale, into which persons, animals, or plants are divided, with\n\nreference      to    their       reproductive          functions”);       The        American\n\nHeritage    Dictionary        1605      (5th    ed.    2011)       (“Either    of    the    two\n\ndivisions, designated female and male, by which most organisms\n\nare classified on the basis of their reproductive organs and\n\nfunctions”); Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 1140 (11th\n\n\n                                               62\n\fed. 2011) (“either of the two major forms of individuals that\n\noccur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as\n\nfemale or male esp. on the basis of their reproductive organs\n\nand   structures”).

But, it is\n\nnot immediately apparent whether G.G., the government, and the\n\nmajority contend that the term “sex” as used in Title IX and its\n\nregulations       refers   (1)    to    both     biological      sex        and    gender\n\nidentity; (2) to either biological sex or gender identity; or\n\n(3) to only “gender identity.”            In his brief, G.G. seems to take\n\nthe position that the term “sex” at least includes a reference\n\nto gender identity.        This is the position taken in his complaint\n\n\n                                         63\n\fwhen he alleges, “Under Title IX, discrimination ‘on the basis\n\nof   sex’   encompasses     both   discrimination        based     on   biological\n\ndifferences between men and women and discrimination based on\n\ngender nonconformity.”         The government seems to be taking the\n\nsame position, contending that the term “sex” “encompasses both\n\nsex -- that is, the biological differences between men and women\n\n--   and    gender    [identity].”       (Emphasis      in    original).          The\n\nmajority, however, seems to suggest that the term “sex” refers\n\nonly to gender identity, as it relies solely on the statement in\n\nthe Office for Civil Rights’ letter of January 7, 2015, which\n\nsaid,   “When    a    school   elects    to    separate      or   treat       students\n\ndifferently on the basis of sex [for the purpose of providing\n\nrestrooms,      locker    rooms,   and       other    facilities],        a    school\n\ngenerally must treat transgender students consistent with their\n\ngender identity.”         (Emphasis added).          But, regardless of where\n\nG.G., the government, and the majority purport to stand on this\n\nquestion, the clear effect of their new definition of sex not\n\nonly tramples the relevant statutory and regulatory language and\n\ndisregards the privacy concerns animating that text, it is also\n\nillogical and unworkable.\n\n      If the term “sex” as used in the statute and regulations\n\nrefers to both biological sex and gender identity, then, while\n\nthe School Board’s policy is in compliance with respect to most\n\nstudents,     whose      biological     sex    aligns     with     their       gender\n\n\n                                        64\n\fidentity, for students whose biological sex and gender identity\n\ndo not align, no restroom or locker room separation could ever\n\nbe    accomplished      consistent         with       the     regulation           because    a\n\ntransgender      student’s     use    of       a   boys’    or    girls’          restroom    or\n\nlocker room could not satisfy the conjunctive criteria.                                    Given\n\nthat G.G. and the government do not challenge schools’ ability\n\nto    separate   restrooms     and     locker        rooms       for    male       and   female\n\nstudents,     surely    they   cannot       be      advocating         an    interpretation\n\nthat places schools in an impossible position.                              Moreover, such\n\nan interpretation would deny G.G. the right to use either the\n\nboys’    or   girls’     restrooms,        a       position      that       G.G.    does     not\n\nadvocate.\n\n       If the position of G.G., the government, and the majority\n\nis that the term “sex” means either biological sex or gender\n\nidentity,     then     the   School     Board’s         policy         is    in    compliance\n\nbecause it segregates the facilities on the basis of biological\n\nsex, a satisfactory component of the disjunctive.\n\n       Therefore, when asserting that G.G. must be allowed to use\n\nthe   boys’   restrooms      and     locker        rooms    as    consistent         with    his\n\ngender identity, G.G., the government, and the majority must be\n\narguing that “sex” as used in Title IX and its regulations means\n\nonly gender identity.          But this construction would, in the end,\n\nmean that a school could never meaningfully provide separate\n\nrestrooms and locker rooms on the basis of sex.                                    Biological\n\n\n                                           65\n\fmales     and    females     whose   gender    identity     aligned    would   be\n\nrequired to use the same restrooms and locker rooms as persons\n\nof the opposite biological sex whose gender identity did not\n\nalign.     With such mixed use of separate facilities, no purpose\n\nwould be gained by designating a separate use “on the basis of\n\nsex,” and privacy concerns would be left unaddressed.\n\n      Moreover, enforcement of any separation would be virtually\n\nimpossible.        Basing restroom access on gender identity would\n\nrequire schools to assume gender identity based on appearances,\n\nsocial expectations, or explicit declarations of identity, which\n\nthe     government      concedes     would     render   Title    IX      and   its\n\nregulations nonsensical:\n\n      Certainly a school that has created separate restrooms\n      for boys and girls could not decide that only students\n      who dress, speak, and act sufficiently masculine count\n      as boys entitled to use the boys’ restroom, or that\n      only students who wear dresses, have long hair, and\n      act sufficiently feminine may use the girls’ restroom.\n\nYet, by interpreting Title IX and the regulations as “requiring\n\nschools     to     treat     students     consistent      with   their     gender\n\nidentity,”       and   by   disallowing    schools   from   treating     students\n\nbased on their biological sex, the government’s position would\n\nhave precisely the effect the government finds to be at odds\n\nwith common sense.\n\n      Finally, in arguing that he should not be assigned to the\n\ngirls’ restrooms, G.G. states that “it makes no sense to place a\n\n\n\n\n                                          66\n\ftransgender boy in the girls’ restroom in the name of protecting\n\nstudent privacy” because “girls objected to his presence in the\n\ngirls’ restrooms because they perceived him as male.”                               But the\n\nsame argument applies to his use of the boys’ restrooms, where\n\nboys felt uncomfortable because they perceived him as female.\n\nIn any scenario based on gender identity, moreover, there would\n\nbe no accommodation for the recognized need for physiological\n\nprivacy.\n\n     In    short,       it     is    impossible     to    determine        how    G.G.,    the\n\ngovernment, and the majority would apply the provisions of Title\n\nIX   and    the        implementing       regulations           that      allow    for     the\n\nseparation of living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and\n\nshower facilities “on the basis of sex” if “sex” means gender\n\nidentity.\n\n     The Office for Civil Rights letter, on which the majority\n\nexclusively relies, hardly provides an answer.                            In one sentence\n\nit   states       that       schools     “generally           must    treat      transgender\n\nstudents consistent with their gender identity,” whatever that\n\nmeans,     and    in     the    next    sentence,        it    encourages        schools    to\n\nprovide     “gender-neutral,            individual-user              facilities     to     any\n\nstudent     who     does       not     want    to    use        shared     sex-segregated\n\nfacilities.”           While the first sentence might be impossible to\n\nenforce without destroying all privacy-serving separation, the\n\nsecond     sentence       encourages      schools,        such       as   Gloucester      High\n\n\n                                              67\n\fSchool,      to   provide    unisex      single-stall           restrooms     for   any\n\nstudents who are uncomfortable with sex-separated facilities, as\n\nthe school in fact provided.\n\n      As it stands, Title IX and its implementing regulations\n\nauthorize     schools   to     separate,      on    the    basis     of    sex,   living\n\nfacilities,       restrooms,    locker     rooms,         and    shower    facilities,\n\nwhich must allow for separation on the basis of biological sex.\n\nGloucester High School thus clearly complied with the statute\n\nand   regulations.          But,   as   it    did     so,       it   was   nonetheless\n\nsensitive to G.G.’s gender transition, accommodating virtually\n\nevery wish that he had.            Indeed, he initially requested and was\n\ngranted the use of the nurse’s restroom.                    And, after both girls\n\nand boys objected to his using the girls’ and boys’ restrooms,\n\nthe school provided individual unisex restrooms, as encouraged\n\nby the letter from the Office for Civil Rights.                            Thus, while\n\nGloucester High School made a good-faith effort to accommodate\n\nG.G. and help him in his transition, balancing its concern for\n\nhim with its responsibilities to all students, it still acted\n\nlegally in maintaining a policy that provided all students with\n\nphysiological privacy and safety in restrooms and locker rooms.\n\n      Because the Gloucester County School Board did not violate\n\nTitle   IX    and   Regulation      106.33     in    adopting        the   policy   for\n\nseparate restrooms and locker rooms, I would affirm the district\n\n\n\n\n                                         68\n\fcourt’s decision dismissing G.G.’s Title IX claim and therefore\n\ndissent.\n\n       I also dissent from the majority’s decision to vacate the\n\ndistrict     court’s      denial          of    G.G.’s         motion      for    a     preliminary\n\ninjunction.       As    the   Supreme           Court         has    consistently        explained,\n\n“[a]   preliminary        injunction            is       an    extraordinary          remedy”    that\n\n“may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is\n\nentitled     to    such    relief,”            and       “‘[i]n      exercising       their     sound\n\ndiscretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for\n\nthe public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy.’”\n\nWinter v.
