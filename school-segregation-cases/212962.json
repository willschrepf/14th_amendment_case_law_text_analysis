This section\n\festablishes strict disclosure requirements for any organization that declares itself a\n\n“political or ganizatio n” und er section 527(i) in order to exemp t large po rtions of its\n\ncampaig n-related income from tax ation. Be cause w e believe th at section 5 27(j)\n\nmerely imposes conditions upon the receipt of a voluntary tax subsidy, we treat\n\nthat section as part of the overall tax scheme, subject to the Anti-Injunction Act, 26\n\nU.S.C . § 7421 (a). We therefor e vacate th e decision of the dis trict court.\n\n       Cong ress enac ted 26 U .S.C. § 5 27 in 19 75 in or der to sh ield contr ibutions to\n\npolitical or ganizatio ns from taxation a s incom e. See S. Rep. No. 93-1357 at 7501-\n\n03 (1974). Under this section, a political organization need not declare\n\ncontribu tions, du es, or fun d-raising proceed s as incom e if the org anization uses this\n\nmoney for the “influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination or\n\nappointment of any individual to any Federal, State or local public office.” 26\n\nU.S.C . § 527( e)(2). A s origina lly enacted , Section 527 did not con tain separ ate\n\ndisclosure requirements, apparently in large part because the Federal Election\n\nCampaign Act (FCA), 2 U.S.C. §§ 431 et seq., already established disclosure\n\nrequirem ents for e xpend itures by “p olitical com mittees.” 1 The following year,\n\n       1\n        As Senator Carl Levin later remarked,\n       At the time Congress established the [section 527] tax exemption, it assumed that such\n       organizations would be filing with the FEC under the campaign finance laws for the\n       obvious reason that the language for both coverage by the IRS and coverage by the FEC\n       were the same–‘influencing an election’. Consequently it was assumed that section 527\n       didn't need to require disclosure with the IRS, since the FEC disclosure was considerably\n       more complete.\n\n                                               2\n\fhowe ver, the S uprem e Cour t constru ed “expe nditures ” under FCA to includ e only\n\n“express advocacy” that explicitly called for the election or defeat of a particular\n\ncandida te within a specific e lection. Buckle y v. Vale , 424 U .S. 1, 79 -80 (19 76).\n\nThis ruling effectively eliminated disclosure requirements for anything other than\n\nexpress advoca cy. See also 146 Cong. Rec. S5994 at S5995-96 (June 28, 2000)\n\n(statement of Sen. Lieberman) (describing successful attempts by section 527\n\norganizations to evade disclosure as a result of this ruling).\n\n       In response to the spectacular increase in the use of section 527\n\norganizations for tax-exempt political expenditures w ith limited public scrutiny,\n\nCong ress add ed section s 527(i) and 52 7(j) in 20 00. See Pub. L . 106-2 30, 114 Stat.\n\n477 (July 1, 2000). Under section 527(i), an organization must give formal notice\n\nto the Secretary of the Treasury in order to receive tax-exempt treatment for\n\ncampaign-related income. 26 U.S.C. § 527(i)(1). Under section 527(j), such an\n\norganization must disclose the name, address and occupation of each contributor\n\nwho gives more than $200 in the aggregate, as well as the name and address of\n\neach recip ient of m ore than $500 in aggreg ate expen ditures. 2 6 U.S .C. §\n\n527(j)(3).2 If an organization that gives notice under section 527(i) fails to make\n\n146 Cong. Rec. S6044 (June 29, 2000) (statement of Sen. Levin).\n       2\n        Following the district court decision in this case, Congress amended 527(j) to require\ndisclosure of expenditure purpose as well as the identity of the recipient. Congress also\nexempted organizations focused solely on state and local elections and subject to comparable\n\n                                                3\n\fthe required disclosures, it must pay the highest corporate tax rate on “the amount\n\nto which the failure relates.” 26 U.S.C. § 527(j)(1).\n\n       Shortly after Congress enacted these provisions, numerous section 527\n\norganizations, including Mobile Republican Assembly (the “organizational\n\nappellees”), and several individuals, including campaign contributor Paul\n\nHoughton (the “individual appellees”), filed this suit in federal district court\n\nseeking both a declaration that the provisions were unconstitutional and an\n\ninjunctio n agains t their enfo rcemen t. In rejectin g the go vernm ent’s mo tion to\n\ndismiss, the district court recognized that the Anti-Injunction Act3 barred the action\n\nto the exte nt that it sou ght to en join the co llection of a tax. Nat’l Fed’n of\n\nRepublican Assemblies v. United States (“Republican Assem blies I”), 148 F. Supp.\n\n2d 127 3, 1278 (S.D. A la. 2001 ). How ever, the c ourt fou nd that se ction 52 7(j)\n\nconstituted a penalty rather than a tax, citing in part the lack of revenue-related\n\npurpo se and th e use of th e word “penalty” w ithin the su bsection heading . Id. at\n\n1278-80.\n\n       The court also treated the provision as a penalty rather than a tax when\n\nanalyzing the substantive constitutional claims in an order granting partial\n\ndisclosure requirements under state law. See Pub. L. 107-276, 116 Stat. 1929 (Nov. 2, 2002).\n       3\n        The Anti-Injunction Act provides that “no suit for the purpose of restraining the\nassessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or\nnot such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.” 26 U.S.C. § 7421(a).\n\n                                                4\n\fsumm ary judg ment to th e appellee s. Nat’l Fed’n of Republican Assemblies v.\n\nUnited States (“Republican Assemblies II”) 218 F. Supp. 2d 1300, 1318-23 (S.D.\n\nAla. 2002).4 The court surmised that man y section 527 organizations wo uld refuse\n\nto disclose both contributions and expenditures. As a result, they would be subject\n\nto the highest corporate tax rate on the amount of money coming in as well as the\n\namoun t of mon ey going out. Th us, the fin ancial con sequen ces of failin g to com ply\n\nwith the disclosure requirements might exceed the tax benefit obtained, making the\n\nassessm ent a “pen alty” rather than a tax . Id. at 1318-21. We disagree with the\n\ncourt’s characterization and hold that section 527(j) forms part of the overall tax\n\nscheme.\n\n       In Regan v. Taxation With Representation, 461 U .S. 540 (1983), the\n\nSupreme Court interpreted an analogous provision of the tax code, section\n\n501(c)(3). That section grants a tax exemption (as well as a tax deduction for\n\ncontributors) to certain non-profit organizations so long as they do not dedicate a\n\n“substantial portion” of their activities to the attempt to influence legislation. 26\n\nU.S.C. § 501(c)(3). Taxation With Representation (TWR), a tax policy advocacy\n\n\n       4\n        On the merits, the court weighed the intrusiveness of the disclosure requirements against\nthe government’s interests in increasing public information about candidates and deterring actual\nand perceived corruption. Applying strict scrutiny analysis, the court upheld the required\ndisclosure of contributors but found that disclosure of expenditures violated the First\nAmendment. The court also found that required disclosure of expenditures violated the equal\nprotection component of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause and the Tenth Amendment.\n\n                                                5\n\fgroup, challenged the Internal Revenue Service’s denial of its attempt to register\n\nunder this provision, arguing that the prohibition against substantial lobbying\n\nviolated b oth its Fir st Ame ndmen t right to sp eak and its Fifth A mendm ent right to\n\nequal pr otection v is-a-vis o ther org anization s.\n\n       The Supreme Court rejected these claims. The Court noted that tax\n\nexemptions were a “form of subsidy . . . administered through the tax system” and\n\nheld that Congress had legitimately decided “not to subsidize lobbying as\n\nextensively as it chose to subsidize other activities that nonprofit organizations\n\nundertake to promote the public welfare.” 461 U.S. at 544. Although TWR argued\n\nthat the restriction on lobbying imposed an unconstitutional condition on the\n\nreceipt of tax-deductible contributions, the Court treated the prohibition against\n\nlobbying as a legitimate, congressionally-mandated component of the voluntary tax\n\nexemption. That is, the Court analyzed the condition within the context of the\n\noverall tax scheme , rather than as a sep arate pro vision o r penalty.\n\n       The C ourt ob served th at TW R rema ined free to receive tax-ded uctible\n\ncontributions for non-lobbying activities and to engage in lobbying using other\n\nfinancial resources. Congress, however, was not obliged to provide a tax subsidy\n\nmerely because the organization wished to use it for political speech: “Although\n\nTWR does no t have as m uch mo ney as it w ants, and thus can not exer cise its\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\ffreedom of speech as much as it would like, the Constitution does not confer an\n\nentitlement to such funds as may be necessary to realize all the advantages of that\n\nfreedom.” Id. at 549. As a result, the Court upheld differential treatment of §\n\n501(c)(3) organizations against both F irst and Fifth Amendm ent challenges.\n\n      We believe that section 527(j) falls squarely under Regan. Congress has\n\nenacted no barrier to the exercise of the appellees’ constitutional rights. Rather,\n\nCong ress has e stablished certain req uiremen ts that must be follo wed in order to\n\nclaim the b enefit of a public tax subsidy . Any p olitical org anization uncom fortable\n\nwith the disclosure of expenditures or contributions may simply decline to register\n\nunder section 527(i) and avoid these requirements altogether. The fact that the\n\norganization might then engage in somewhat less speech because of stricter\n\nfinancial constraints does not create a constitutionally mandated right to the tax\n\nsubsidy. Similarly, the fact that some self-declared section 527 organizations may\n\nlater choose to withhold disclosure and, as a result, may pay more in taxes than\n\nthey would have paid without tax-exempt status does not make the initial decision\n\nto register under section 527 any less voluntary. Rather, we consider the statutory\n\nscheme as a whole and treat the consequences of violating the conditions of the\n\nsubsidy as part of the tax fra mewo rk.\n\n      Because the section 527(j) disclosure requirements constitute conditions\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\fattached to the receipt of a tax subsidy, we hold that penalties imposed for\n\nviolating the conditions of that tax status should be considered as part of the tax for\n\npurpo ses of an alysis und er the A nti-Injun ction A ct.5 As a result, we conclude that\n\nthe Act bars the organizational appellees from seeking injunctive relief.6 Instead,\n\nthey must pursue relief within a suit for refund after the tax has been assessed and\n\npaid. See Enochs v. Williams Packing & Nav. Co., 370 U .S. 1, 7 (1 962).\n\n       The appellees assert that third parties such as individual contributor Paul\n\n       5\n         In its denial of the government’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on Anti-Injunction Act\ngrounds, the district court concluded that the disclosure requirements did not serve a discernible\nrevenue purpose and thus fell under the line of cases allowing suits against penalties imposed\nthrough the tax code. Republican Assemblies I, 148 F. Supp. 2d at 1278. However, those cases\ninvolve tax penalties imposed for substantive violations of laws not directly related to the tax\ncode. See Lipke v. Lederer, 259 U.S. 557, 561-62 (1922) (allowing a suit against penalties\nimposed for violating the Prohibition Act); Regal Drug Corp. v. Wardell, 260 U.S. 386, 391-92\n(1922) (same). In Bob Jones University v. Simon, 416 U.S. 725 (1974), the Supreme Court\nrejected the argument that the Anti-Injunction Act did not apply whenever adverse revenue\nconsequences were imposed for non-tax purposes. In that case, the university challenged an IRS\ndecision to rescind its § 501(c)(3) tax status because of its discriminatory admission policies.\nThe Court held that the Anti-Injunction Act barred the suit:\n        Petitioner further contends that the Service's actions do not represent an effort to protect\n        the revenues but an attempt to regulate the admissions policies of private universities.\n        Under this line of argument, the Anti-Injunction Act is said to be inapplicable because\n        the case does not truly involve taxes. We disagree. The Service bases its present\n        position with regard to the tax status of segregative private schools on its interpretation of\n        the Code. There is no evidence that that position does not represent a good-faith effort to\n        enforce the technical requirements of the tax laws, and, without indicating a view as to\n        whether the Service's interpretation is correct, we cannot say that its position has no legal\n        basis or is unrelated to the protection of the revenues. The Act is therefore applicable.\nId. at 739-40. Similarly, in this case, the IRS bases its position squarely upon the explicit\nlanguage of the Internal Revenue Code, and the disclosure conditions form part of the overall tax\nsubsidy scheme.\n       6\n        Because the federal tax exception to the Declaratory Judgment Act is at least as broad as\nthe prohibition of the Anti-Injunction Act, our holding also forecloses the appellees from seeking\ndeclaratory relief. See Alexander v. “Americans United,” Inc., 416 U.S. 752, 758 n.10 (1974).\n\n                                                  8\n\fHaughton may not challenge the tax in a refund suit because they do not pay any\n\ntaxes under section 527 and thus may not initiate a suit for refund. Therefore, they\n\ncontend, Haughton falls under the exception to the Anti-Injunction Act described\n\nin South Carolina v. Regan, 465 U.S. 367 (1984). In that case, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that “Congress did not intend the Act to apply to actions brought by aggrieved\n\nparties for whom it has not provided an alternative remedy.” Id. at 378. E ven if\n\nHaughton might be eligible for the South Carolina exception, however, his claims\n\nprimarily involve the disclosure of his identity as a contributor. Complaint at para.\n\n61-62. The district court upheld the constitutionality of contributor disclosure, and\n\nthat portion of its ruling is not on appeal here.7\n\n\n\nVACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO DISMISS FOR\n\nLACK OF JURISDICTION.\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         The appellees note that the district court also found section 527(j) unconstitutional with\nrespect to contributions under its Tenth Amendment analysis. See Mobile Republican II, 218 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1352. However, this analysis rested on the finding that section 527(j) “is not a\nrevenue measure and does not serve any revenue purpose.” Id. Our analysis above disposes of\nthis issue. Section 527(j) merely places conditions on private organizations who voluntarily seek\na federal tax subsidy, something well within the taxing authority conferred upon Congress. We\nalso note that the complaint does not allege that Haughton ever gave money to state political\norganizations, making his connection to this claim highly tenuous. See Complaint at para. 19,\n61-62. In addition, Congress has now exempted many purely state-level organizations from\nsection 527(j) disclosure requirements. See Pub. L. 107-276, 116 Stat. 1929 (Nov. 2, 2002).\n\n                                                 9\n\f",

Taxation With Representation,</i> 461 U.S. 540, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983), the Supreme Court interpreted an analogous provision of the tax code, section 501(c)(3). That section grants a tax exemption (as well as a tax deduction for contributors) to certain nonprofit organizations so long as they do not dedicate a \"substantial portion\" of their activities to the attempt to influence legislation. 26 U.S.C. &#167; 501(c)(3). Taxation With Representation (TWR), a tax policy advocacy group, challenged the Internal Revenue Service's denial of its attempt to register under this provision, arguing that the prohibition against substantial lobbying violated both its First Amendment right to speak and its Fifth Amendment right to equal protection vis-a-vis other organizations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court rejected these claims. The Court noted that tax exemptions were a \"form of subsidy ... administered through the tax system\" and held that Congress had legitimately decided \"not to subsidize lobbying as extensively as it chose to subsidize other activities that nonprofit organizations undertake to promote the public welfare.\" 461 U.S. at 544, 103 S.Ct. 1997. Although TWR argued that the restriction on lobbying imposed an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of tax-deductible contributions, the Court treated the prohibition against lobbying as a legitimate, congressionally-mandated component of the voluntary tax exemption. That is, the Court analyzed the condition within the context of the overall tax scheme, rather than as a separate provision or penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court observed that TWR remained free to receive tax-deductible contributions for non-lobbying activities and to engage in lobbying using other financial resources. Congress, however, was not obliged to provide a tax subsidy merely because the organization wished to use it for political speech: \"Although TWR does not have as much money as it wants, and thus cannot exercise its freedom of speech as much as it would like, the Constitution does not confer an entitlement to such funds as may be necessary to realize all the advantages of that freedom.\" <i>Id.</i> at 549, 103 S.Ct. 1997. As a result, the Court upheld differential treatment of &#167; 501(c)(3) organizations against both First and Fifth Amendment challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that section 527(j) falls squarely under <i>Regan.</i> Congress has enacted no barrier to the exercise of the appellees' constitutional rights. Rather, Congress has established certain requirements that must be followed in order to claim the benefit of a public tax subsidy. Any political organization uncomfortable with the disclosure of expenditures or contributions may simply decline to register under section 527(i) and avoid these requirements altogether. The fact that the organization might then engage in somewhat less speech because of stricter financial constraints does not create a constitutionally mandated right to the tax subsidy. Similarly, the fact that some self-declared section 527 organizations may later choose to withhold disclosure and, as a result, may pay more in taxes than they would have paid without tax-exempt status does not make the initial decision to register under section 527 any less voluntary. Rather, we consider the statutory scheme as a whole and treat the consequences of violating the conditions of the subsidy as part of the tax framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the section 527(j) disclosure requirements constitute conditions attached to the receipt of a tax subsidy, we hold that penalties imposed for violating the conditions of that tax status should be considered as part of the tax for purposes of analysis under the Anti-Injunction Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As a result, we conclude that the Act bars the organizational appellees from seeking injunctive relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Instead, they must pursue relief within a suit for refund after the tax has been assessed and paid. <i>See Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Nav.

Therefore, they contend, Haughton falls under the exception to the Anti-Injunction Act described in <i>South Carolina v. Regan,</i> 465 U.S. 367, 104 S.Ct. 1107, 79 L.Ed.2d 372 (1984). In that case, the Supreme Court held that \"Congress did not intend the Act to apply to actions brought by aggrieved parties for whom it has not provided an alternative remedy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 378, 104 S.Ct. 1107. Even if Haughton might be eligible for the <i>South Carolina</i> exception, however, his claims primarily involve the disclosure of his identity as a contributor. Complaint at para. 61-62.

However, those cases involve tax penalties imposed for substantive violations of laws not directly related to the tax code. <i>See Lipke v. Lederer,</i> 259 U.S. 557, 561-62, 42 S.Ct. 549, 66 L.Ed. 1061 (1922) (allowing a suit against penalties imposed for violating the Prohibition Act); <i>Regal Drug Corp. v. Wardell,</i> 260 U.S. 386, 391-92, 43 S.Ct. 152, 67 L.Ed. 318 (1922) (same). In <i>Bob Jones University v. Simon,</i> 416 U.S. 725, 94 S.Ct. 2038, 40 L.Ed.2d 496 (1974), the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the Anti-Injunction Act did not apply whenever adverse revenue consequences were imposed for non-tax purposes. In that case, the university challenged an IRS decision to rescind its &#167; 501(c)(3) tax status because of its discriminatory admission policies. The Court held that the Anti-Injunction Act barred the suit:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner further contends that the Service's actions do not represent an effort to protect the revenues but an attempt to regulate the admissions policies of private universities. Under this line of argument, the Anti-Injunction Act is said to be inapplicable because the case does not truly involve taxes. We disagree. The Service bases its present position with regard to the tax status of segregative private schools on its interpretation of the Code. There is no evidence that that position does not represent a good-faith effort to enforce the technical requirements of the tax laws, and, without indicating a view as to whether the Service's interpretation is correct, we cannot say that its position has no legal basis or is unrelated to the protection of the revenues. The Act is therefore applicable.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 739-40, 94 S.Ct. 2038.

Because we believe that section 527(j) merely imposes conditions upon the receipt of a voluntary tax subsidy, we treat that section as part of the overall tax scheme, subject to the Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7421(a).

As originally enacted, Section 527 did not contain separate disclosure requirements, apparently in large part because the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), 2 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 431 <i>et seq.,</i> already established disclosure requirements for expenditures by \"political committees.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The following year, however, the Supreme Court construed \"expenditures\" under FECA to include only \"express advocacy\" that explicitly called for the election or defeat of a particular candidate within a specific election. <i>Buckley v.

Rather, Congress has established certain requirements that must be followed in order to claim the benefit of a public tax subsidy. Any political organization uncomfortable with the disclosure of expenditures or contributions may simply decline to register under section 527(i) and avoid these requirements altogether. The fact that the organization might then engage in somewhat less speech because of stricter financial constraints does not create a constitutionally mandated right to the tax subsidy. Similarly, the fact that some self-declared section 527 organizations may later choose to withhold disclosure and, as a result, may pay more in taxes than they would have paid without tax-exempt status does not make the initial decision to register under section 527 any less voluntary. Rather, we consider the statutory scheme as a whole and treat the consequences of violating the conditions of the subsidy as part of the tax framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the section 527(j) disclosure requirements constitute conditions attached to the receipt of a tax subsidy, we hold that penalties imposed for violating the conditions of that tax status should be considered as part of the tax for purposes of analysis under the Anti-Injunction Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As a result, we conclude that the Act bars the organizational appellees from seeking injunctive relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Instead, they must pursue relief within a suit for refund after the tax has been assessed and paid. <i>See Enochs v.

Under this line of argument, the Anti-Injunction Act is said to be inapplicable because the case does not truly involve taxes. We disagree. The Service bases its present position with regard to the tax status of segregative private schools on its interpretation of the Code. There is no evidence that that position does not represent a good-faith effort to enforce the technical requirements of the tax laws, and, without indicating a view as to whether the Service's interpretation is correct, we cannot say that its position has no legal basis or is unrelated to the protection of the revenues.
