Bd., 282 N.W .2d 1 60 (Mich. 19 79), a\ngroup of already-retired judges challenged legislation amending the\nJudges Retirement Act to increase the pension benefits to judges who\nretired after its effected date. The amendment caused the pension of new\nand still-active judges to be higher than retirees’ benefits. The M ichigan\nSupreme Court analyzed the statute under the rational-basis test and\nconcluded that statute was constitutional. Ir reasoned that the legislation\nwas rational because the Legislature was inducing “competent and\nqualified attorneys to become judges, or to remain judg es if alread y in\noffice.” Id. at 168.\n\f",
