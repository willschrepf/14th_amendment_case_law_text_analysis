Ct. No. C11-01552)\n         Defendant and Respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                INTRODUCTION\n         Plaintiff Richard Howard sued Defendant GC Services, Inc., an entity that\nprovides debt collection services for Los Angeles County, alleging that defendant had\nsent him a letter that falsely stated plaintiff owed Los Angeles County Superior Court\nunadjudicated bail in connection with a red-light camera citation and demanded payment.\nPlaintiff alleged that various representations in the letter were false and misleading and\ndid not reflect the policies of the Los Angeles Superior Court. Plaintiff appeals from the\ntrial court’s order denying his motion to certify a class of all California residents who had\nreceived letters from the defendant containing similar representations. The trial court\nruled that plaintiff failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that common issues\npredominated, that his claims were typical of the class, and that his attorney was adequate\nto serve as class counsel. We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nA.     Defendant’s Role in Los Angeles’ Traffic Enforcement Camera System\n       In 2007 and 2008, the County of Los Angeles contracted with a third-party vendor\nto operate automated traffic enforcement cameras. These cameras photographed vehicles\ncommitting red-light violations. The third-party vendor obtained information regarding\nthe vehicle that ran the red light and its registered owner from the California Department\nof Motor Vehicles (DMV). The responsible law enforcement agency used this\ninformation to send out a notice of traffic violation and notice to appear to the registered\nowner’s address. If the court date listed in the notice to appear passed without the driver\nappearing in court or paying or contesting the traffic fine, the law enforcement agency\nwould label the account as delinquent with Los Angeles County Superior Court\n(LACSC). LACSC then assessed a $250 delinquency fee to the account, sent the driver a\nnotice of delinquency letter, and referred the account to collections.\n       Defendant is the County of Los Angeles’ collection agency. In 2006, it contracted\nwith the county to “develop a comprehensive court/county collection program to improve\nenforcement of court collections.” Under this contract, the County would refer certain\naccounts—including “[t]raffic citations where a [driver] fails to appear before being\nsentenced”—to defendant for collection. Upon receiving information from the County,\ndefendant was required to send “Delinquency Letters” to debtors upon receiving the\ninformation from the County. The contract required that the letter identify the defendant,\n“[i]nform the debtor of the origin of the debt and the current amount owed;” “[a]dvise of\nthe consequences of continued non-compliance, such as wage garnishment, and property\nseizures”; and “[e]xplain that a debtor with an Infraction/Misdemeanor with\nUnadjudicated Bail . . . who wishes to dispute the debt must schedule a court\nappearance.”\nB.     Plaintiff’s Allegations\n       Plaintiff filed this action on July 7, 2011. The fourth amended class action\ncomplaint, the operative complaint for our purposes, was filed on September 17, 2012.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       On July 12, 2010, plaintiff received a single page letter from defendant that is the\nfocus of this lawsuit. This letter, attached to the fourth amended complaint as Exhibit A,\nhas the words “balance due statement” in bold, capitalized print near the top of the page,\nand purports to be from GC Services Limited Partnership Collection Agency Division.\nThe letter asserts that plaintiff owes LACSC $680.00 and that this amount “may include\nmultiple citations.” It advises plaintiff that his “failure to respond to previous\nnotifications may result in the Los Angeles Superior Court obtaining a civil money\njudgment against you” and that the “State of California’s Department of Motor Vehicles\nis assisting us in locating you.” The letter then states: “You should take this opportunity\nto contact us immediately . . . . By contacting us at this time to resolve your unpaid bail,\nyou will avoid further methods of collection which may include pursuing a civil money\njudgment” which would result in “garnishing your wages or other sources of income”;\n“attaching your bank account”; “filing a lien which will attach to all real property you\nnow own or later acquire in California”; and “all other lawful processes.”\n       Plaintiff alleged that he had never received any prior notification about any\ncitation. He called defendant at the phone number listed in the letter, and a representative\ninformed plaintiff that he had been “cited for running a red light which was captured by\ncamera in Southern California” and the camera had “identified the vehicle and its license\nplate number.” Plaintiff, a resident of Concord, California, told the representative that he\nhad not been in Southern California since 1999, had never received a traffic citation\nthere, and did not own (and never had owned) a car matching the description of the car\nwhich allegedly ran the red light.\n       Plaintiff next contacted the DMV and inquired about the citation. He told the\nDMV representative that he had never received a citation, a notice to appear in court, or\nany judgment from a court. He further stated that his ability to register his vehicle had\nnot been made contingent on the payment of any citation and no “points” had been placed\non his driving record. Plaintiff alleges that the “DMV could not resolve the issue.”\n       On July 20, 2010, plaintiff, through his attorney, sent defendant a certified letter.\nPlaintiff’s letter (which was not on attorney letterhead and appeared to be signed by him)\n\n\n                                              3\n\fstated that he had been the victim of identity theft around the time of the alleged red light\nviolation and that “various vehicles were purchased with [his] identifying information.”\nPlaintiff stated he had since been “vindicated by litigation.” He wrote that he had never\nowned the car that allegedly ran the red light, had never received a traffic citation in\nSouthern California, and had not been in Southern California since 1999. Plaintiff never\nreceived a response to his letter. According to defendant, however, it closed plaintiff’s\naccount and stopped attempting to collect it as a result of plaintiff’s letter.\n        Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Complaint alleges five causes of action: (1)\nnegligence; (2) negligent misrepresentation; (3) fraud; (4) declaratory relief; and (5)\nunfair business practices under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL). Each cause of action\ngenerally alleged that the representations in defendant’s letter—namely that the DMV\nwas assisting defendant in locating individuals and that there would be various\nconsequences if the recipient did not respond—were false based on LACSC’s policies,\nand that defendant knew, or should have known, of the falsity of the representations.\nPlaintiff alleged that where a citation was based on a red-light camera, LACSC “does not\ndeem itself as having jurisdiction and does not allow default judgments, liens,\ngarnishment, levies or other such activity, nor does it report such citations to the DMV\neither. It appears such may be true in all such cases.”\n        Plaintiff alleged he suffered damage because he was “compelled to contact\nDefendants, the DMV and an attorney about these matter [sic] and had to pay an attorney\nfor assistance in drafting a letter regarding these baseless accusations. Additionally, he\nhas incurred emotional distress in dealing with this matter.” Others in the putative class,\nhe alleged, suffered damage by actually paying the citations. In his declaratory relief\ncause of action, plaintiff sought a declaration that defendant must refrain from making\nthese representations and a “declaration of rights and duties regarding whether\nDefendants were debt collecting under the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collections Practices\nAct.”\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fC.     Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification\n       Plaintiff filed a motion to certify the class on September 28, 2012.1 Plaintiff\nsought to certify a class of every “California resident who, on or after July 1, 2007, was\nthe subject of a letter from Defendants regarding a red light camera citation and which\nrepresented (a) the Department of Motor Vehicles was assisting defendants in locating\nthem (b) that a balance was due or an amount was owing on such citation and/or (c) that\nfailure to respond to the letter might result in wage garnishment, bank levies, liens or\nother collection activity set forth in the letter.”\n       Plaintiff argued that defendant had admitted in discovery that thousands of\nindividuals had received letters that contained substantially similar representations to the\nletter received by plaintiff. He argued, therefore, that each class member had been\n“subjected to a common course of conduct. The proof of each will be simply based on\nthe terms of those letters and whether they violated law under any of the theories\nalleged.” In support of his certification motion, plaintiff submitted the letter he received\nfrom defendant, the letter he sent defendant in response, and a copy of the Notice of\nTraffic Violation related to the underlying red-light citation. Plaintiff’s counsel, Ron\nBochner, provided a declaration asserting that he was “experienced in complex litigation”\nand had been “named class counsel in eight cases, all of which settled or are in the\nprocess of settling . . . and two other cases which are pending but have not been certified\nto date.”\n       On May 7, 2013, defendant filed its opposition to the class certification motion.2\nDefendant argued that common questions of law or fact did not exist because plaintiff’s\n\n\n       1\n         The trial court set the September 28, 2012, deadline for filing the class\ncertification motion at the April 26, 2012, case management conference.\n       2\n         For reasons that are not entirely clear in the record, defendant’s opposition was\nfiled eight months after plaintiff’s motion. It appears that on September 14, 2012, the\nparties filed a “Stipulation and Order Extending Time for MTN to Compel.” The text of\nthis stipulation is not in the record. In plaintiff’s motion for class certification, plaintiff\nstated that because a “discovery issue remains pending, and for other reasons, the parties\nstipulated [to extend] the time to bring a Motion to Compel further responses and to\n\n                                                5\n\ftheories relied on the adjudication of individual issues such as (1) whether the class\nmember paid the requested balance; (2) whether the class member ran the red light; or (3)\nwhether the individual paid the outstanding balance as a result of defendant’s letter.\nDefendant contended that these individualized determinations meant that its liability, if\nany, could not be determined on a class-wide basis. Defendant also argued that plaintiff’s\nclaims were atypical of those of the purported class because plaintiff had received the\nletter as a result of alleged identity theft, knew he had not run a red light, and did not pay\nthe requested balance. This was, therefore, another reason to deny class certification.\n       Defendant also contended that Bochner was inadequate to serve as class counsel.\nDefendant relied on a finding by a different court in a different case that Bochner had\nengaged in unethical conduct. In Lee v. American Agencies (Alameda County Super. Ct.\nCase No. RG09477598), the superior court granted American Agencies’ motion for\nsummary judgment on debt collection claims raised by a plaintiff represented by\nBochner. Subsequently, the court awarded American Agencies its attorneys’ fees. The\ncourt found that American Agencies had “shown that many of Plaintiffs’ allegations and\npositions taken in this lawsuit were baseless (or put another way, were not ‘minimally\ncolorable’).” The court further found that when American Agencies had attempted to\nsubpoena certain records, “Plaintiff refused to consent, forcing Defendants to file a\nmotion to obtain credit reporting records, which confirmed that no Defendant had\nreported the disputed item to any credit agency. Plaintiff’s refusal strongly suggests an\nintent to obstruct, rather than resolve, this litigation. Both this claim and Plaintiff’s\ntactics in litigating the claim were completely meritless.” Ultimately, the court stated that\nthe “circumstances in which this case arose are not entirely above suspicion; the manner\nin which Plaintiff’s counsel prosecuted the case is not admirable; and the Court cannot\n\nextend the time for filing class certification briefing and hearing of the class certification\nmotion.” The Register of Actions does not reveal when the order approving this\nstipulation was filed. However, the class certification hearing was repeatedly moved\n(either as the result of a stipulation or motion by defendant), first from November 30,\n2012, to April 16, 2013, then to June 11, 2013, then to July 11, 2013, and finally to\nAugust 20, 2013.\n\n\n                                               6\n\ffind even a minimally colorable claim or position taken by Plaintiff.” The court then\nstated the “evidence overwhelmingly points to the bad faith of [plaintiff’s] attorney.”\n       In opposing the request for attorneys’ fees, Bochner had included an argument that\nany attorneys’ fee award could not be assessed against him. This argument appears to\nhave led the superior court to question whether Bochner had violated the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct. The court concluded its order granting attorneys’ fees by writing:\n“In light of the Court’s above findings regarding counsel’s conduct of this lawsuit, the\nCourt intends to REPORT Attorney Bochner to the California State Bar for violation of\nBusiness & Professions Code section 6068(c). As noted above, the evidence strongly\nsuggests that the tactics and claims giving rise to the fee award are primarily, if not\nsolely, lawyer-driven. Plaintiff has not supplied any declaration in support of her\nopposition and, indeed, there is no evidence that she is even aware of this Motion.\nPerhaps most importantly, at some point during these proceedings, Plaintiff’s and her\nattorney’s interests clearly diverged. Thus, counsel may also have violated one or more\nfiduciary and/or ethical duties to his client in the course of litigating the instant motion.”3\n       In support of its opposition to class certification, defendant submitted the\ndeclaration of Scott Cole, defendant’s managing vice president. Cole described how\nwhen a red-light camera violation was not contested or paid, the “Superior Court’s\nInformation Technology department caused electronic information about such accounts\nto be sent to GCS’s proprietary automated collection system.” The information\ndefendant received from LACSC would vary from fine to fine, but generally included\n“the name of the registered owner of the vehicle involved in the violation . . . , the\nowner’s driver’s license number . . . , the owner’s date of birth, the owner’s address, the\namount placed for collection, the balance due, the date of the violation . . . , and the\n\n       3\n         As we discuss below, by the time of the hearing on the class certification motion\nin this action, Bochner had appealed the award of attorneys’ fees and the order was\nreversed on the ground that plaintiff had asserted at least one colorable claim. (Lee v.\nAmerican Agencies (A133016, A133752, July 2, 2013) 2013 WL 3353895 [nonpub.\nopn.].) Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal referenced Bochner’s “dubious litigation\ntactics.” (Id. at p. *10.)\n\n\n                                               7\n\flicense plate number of the vehicle involved.” Defendant would not be provided with\ncopies of the documents underlying the traffic violation, such as the notice of violation or\nnotice to appear. Cole stated that during the putative class period, 22,587 California\nresidents received letters “that were in the form of the balance due statement letter sent to\nplaintiff that sought to collect fines assessed for red-light violations detected by red-light\ncameras in Los Angeles County.” In addition to such letters, Cole stated that defendant\nemployed other collection efforts, such as phone calls and different letters.\n       On May 28, 2013, plaintiff filed his reply brief in support of class certification.\nPlaintiff argued that the individual issues identified by defendant did not defeat class\ncertification. His position was that defendant’s letter was unlawful because of “Los\nAngeles Superior Court’s refusal to take default judgments in cases where, as here,\ncitizens are cited purely through the use of a technology recording a license plate, not\nupon direct citation of the driver at the time and place where the incident occurred. That\nGC failed to know of or take heed of the presumption of innocence as well as Los\nAngeles Superior Court’s policy and practice is the precise point of this case. GC had a\nduty to assure its representations were true. It did not. If some of the drivers may\nactually have run a red light, there was not and could not be a determination of the fact at\nthe time the letter was sent. . . . The letter represents GC’s uniform policy and practice\nand illegal effect.” For similar reasons, plaintiff argued he was typical of the unnamed\nclass members because he, “like all the class members, received a demand that the full\nsum of money was due and owing and needed to be paid and that certain collection\nefforts could take place if he did not respond to the letter. None of this was proper when\nthe citation was by camera match to the vehicle owner . . . as is again shown by the policy\nof [LACSC] not to take default judgments on such citations.” Responding to defendant’s\nargument that Bochner was an inadequate class counsel, plaintiff asserted that the\nallegations of unprofessional conduct in the American Agencies case had “nothing to do\nwith the elements of class certification or an abuse of the class certification procedure and\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fhas no application in this case. Indeed, in this case plaintiff has undertaken this entire\nmatter in more than good faith.”4\n       Along with his reply brief, plaintiff submitted documents pertaining to LACSC’s\npolicies regarding the handling of red-light citations when a defendant fails to appear.\nPlaintiff submitted two charts from LACSC’s “Clerical Authority” standing orders and\nguidelines. Plaintiff obtained these documents from LACSC pursuant to a subpoena for\nbusiness records. These documents state that, “[p]ursuant to a County Counsel legal\nopinion, no failure to appear violation can be entered” on red light camera citations, and\nthe failure to appear is not reported to the DMV. Instead, a $250 civil assessment is\nadded and LACSC’s system will “automatically refer case to GC Services for\ncollections.”\n       On August 13, 2013—one week before the class certification hearing—Bochner\nfiled a “Supplemental Brief and Declaration of Ron Bochner in Support Thereof on Class\nCertification Motion.” This declaration attached what Bochner described as “various\nmedia reports true and correct copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit A.” Exhibit\nA consists of unlabeled notes that purport to recount a statement by Mary Hearn, the\nDirector of Public Information for LACSC, and three internet news stories (from the Los\nAngeles Times website and “dailynews.com”) from July 2011, September 2011, and\nMarch 2012. Bochner’s declaration did not characterize these documents or otherwise\nmake argument from them. These documents, however, generally purport to paraphrase\nor quote Los Angeles County and LACSC staff for the proposition that LACSC’s policy\nwas not to pursue red-light camera citations where the recipient ignored the citation.\n       In both his reply and supplemental declarations, Bochner recounted his attempt to\nget LACSC personnel to appear at a deposition to “confirm” the statements made in the\nnews stories. In his reply declaration, Bochner asserted that LACSC had “refused to\nappear for deposition and confirm the various newspaper stories.” He stated that if the\n\n       4\n         In a supporting declaration, Bochner attached an eight-page letter he had sent to\nthe California State Bar in response to the American Agencies court’s referral to the state\nbar for unprofessional conduct.\n\n\n                                              9\n\f“court desires further evidence on Los Angeles Superior Court’s practices and policies,\nplaintiff asks leave to supplement this brief and produce that evidence once the\ndeposition has been completed.” In his August 13, 2013, supplemental brief and\ndeclaration, Bochner further detailed his unsuccessful attempts to have an LACSC\nofficial attend a deposition. Bochner asked that “if the certification of the class turns on\nevidence that may be provided by [LACSC], the court allow the certification hearing to\nbe continued to such time as plaintiff is able to obtain such evidence.”\nD.     The Trial Court’s Ruling\n       The hearing on the class certification motion was held on August 20, 2013. In\nadvance of the hearing, the trial court issued a detailed tentative ruling. Following a\nlengthy hearing, the trial court confirmed its tentative ruling and issued a 12-page order\ndenying plaintiff’s motion for class certification.\n       The court found that plaintiff had identified an ascertainable and sufficiently\nnumerous class. It stated that plaintiff’s proposed class definition “includes sufficient\ncommon characteristics to identify members of the class. The court also finds the\nproposed class is sufficiently numerous either at approximately 2,000 as asserted by GCS\nin its discovery response or at over 22,000 as asserted in the Declaration of Scott Cole\nfiled in opposition to plaintiff’s motion for class certification.”\n       The court, however, found that plaintiff had failed to produce sufficient evidence\nthat defendant’s liability could be established by common proof such that common issues\npredominated over individual issues. As to the negligence cause of action, the court\nnoted that “the issue of [defendant’s] liability and whether there is a causal link between\nany breach and damages suffered by the putative class members depends on the\ndetermination of individual issues. . . . The only evidence of liability and causation\noffered in support of plaintiff’s motion for class certification is unique to plaintiff’s\ncircumstances.” As to plaintiff’s attempt to establish defendant’s liability based on proof\nof LACSC’s policies, the court found this did not meet plaintiff’s burden because the\n“theory is not supported by the evidence submitted in support of plaintiff’s motion for\nclass certification.”\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       As to the misrepresentation-based causes of action, the court found that the falsity\nof many of the representations contained in defendant’s letter could not be determined by\ncommon proof. For example, the court stated: “Plaintiff has failed to cite sufficient\nevidence that the falsity of these statements is subject to common proof. Plaintiff cites\nevidence of the falsity of the balance due statement only as it applies to plaintiff. In\ncontrast, whether other class members owed money to LACSC may be true if the person\nreceiving the letter was the driver pictured in the citation and he had failed to appear\nand/or timely pay the citation.” Additionally, the court found that plaintiff had failed to\nshow that the materiality of the representations, and class members’ reliance on those\nrepresentations, was subject to common proof. It stated that a “class member who took\nany steps to dispute the asserted fine, paid a fine that was not actually owed or suffered\nany other damages, may have done so for any number of reasons. He may have relied on\nthe red light letter from GCS but he may have also relied on GCS’s other collection\nefforts or taken action in response to prior correspondence from LACSC.” As to\nplaintiff’s declaratory relief cause of action, however, the court found that common issues\npredominated, but only to the extent plaintiff sought a judicial determination that\ndefendant was engaged in debt collection—a claim included in the fourth amended\ncomplaint simply in anticipation of a defense defendant may have sought to raise.\n       The court next found that plaintiff’s claims were not typical of the class as to the\nnegligence or misrepresentation causes of action because plaintiff “was neither the driver\nnor the registered owner of the car subject to the red light camera citation” and he “never\nreceived the initial citation from the issuing agency or the notice of violation from the\nsuperior court.” Instead, plaintiff “was the victim of identity theft and there [was] no\nevidence other putative class members have suffered similar issues.”\n       The trial court also found that plaintiff had failed to meet his burden of\ndemonstrating that Bochner was qualified to serve as counsel for the class. It found\nBochner’s declaration in support of class certification had failed to provide any\ninformation regarding the size or nature of the class actions for which Bochner had\nserved as class counsel. The court also stated that “Mr. Bochner goes on to say that he\n\n\n                                             11\n\fhas settled all cases in which he was named class counsel and, thus, i[t] can be inferred\nthat he has no experience in bringing such cases to trial. It also appears from plaintiff’s\npleadings that Mr. Bochner is a sole practitioner and . . . likely has insufficient resources\nto adequately serve the interests of a large class of individuals.” The court then found\nthat “[e]ven if plaintiff had met his burden, the court is concerned with counsel’s\ncompetence to represent the proposed class” in light of the superior court’s finding in the\nAmerican Agencies case. The court stated that this finding “casts serious doubt as to Mr.\nBochner’s qualifications and ability to competently represent the class here.”\n       Finally, the trial court found that certifying plaintiff’s proposed class would not\nprovide the litigants and the court a substantial benefit. It stated that a “class action is not\nthe superior method of obtaining relief where proposed class counsel is not qualified and\nonly a declaratory relief allegation, which may not provide complete relief to the class,\nappears to qualify for class treatment.”\n                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       We review the order denying class certification for an abuse of discretion. (Sav-on\nDrug Stores, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 34 Cal.4th 319, 327 (Sav-on); Brinker\nRestaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1004, 1022 (Brinker).) “ ‘Because\ntrial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting\ngroup action, they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.’ ”\n(Sav-on, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 326, quoting Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th\n429, 435 (Linder).) “[A] trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally\nwill not be disturbed ‘unless (1) improper criteria were used [citation]; or (2) erroneous\nlegal assumptions were made [citation].’ ” (Linder, supra, 23 Cal.4th at pp. 435-436.)\n“ ‘Any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.’ ” (Id. at p.\n436, quoting Caro v. Procter & Gamble Co. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 644, 656 (Caro).)\n       However, “ ‘appellate review of orders denying class certification differs from\nordinary appellate review.

[Citations.]\n[¶] We will affirm an order denying class certification if any of the trial court’s stated\nreasons was valid and sufficient to justify the order, and it is supported by substantial\nevidence. [Citations.]’ ” (Mies v. Sephora U.S.A., Inc. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 967, 980,\nquoting Knapp v. AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 932, 939.)\n                                        DISCUSSION\n       Code of Civil Procedure section 382 authorizes class actions “when the question is\none of a common or general interest, of many persons, or when the parties are numerous,\nand it is impracticable to bring them all before the court . . . .” The party seeking class\ncertification “bears the burden of establishing the propriety of class certification.”\n(Washington Mutual Bank v. Superior Court (2001) 24 Cal.4th 906, 922.) “Class\ncertification requires proof (1) of a sufficiently numerous, ascertainable class, (2) of a\nwell-defined community of interest, and (3) that certification will provide substantial\nbenefits to litigants and the courts, i.e., that proceeding as a class is superior to other\nmethods. [Citations.] In turn, the ‘community of interest requirement embodies three\nfactors: (1) predominant common questions of law or fact; (2) class representatives with\nclaims or defenses typical of the class; and (3) class representatives who can adequately\nrepresent the class.’ ” (Fireside Bank v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 1069, 1089\n(Fireside Bank), quoting Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc. (1981) 29 Cal.3d 462, 470.)\n       The question of class certification is “ ‘essentially a procedural one that does not\nask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.’ ” (Koval v. Pacific Bell\nTelephone Co. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 1050, 1057, quoting Linder, supra, 23 Cal.4th at\npp. 439-440.) However, “issues affecting the merits of a case may be enmeshed with\nclass action requirements, such as whether substantially similar questions are common to\nthe class and predominate over individual questions or whether the claims or defenses of\nthe representative plaintiffs are typical of class claims or defenses. [Citations.]” (Linder,\nsupra, 23 Cal.4th at p. 443.)\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\fA.     Predominance of Common Questions\n       Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in concluding that he had failed to\nestablish the predominance of common questions with respect to his claims.\n              1.     Predominance in General\n       “Plaintiffs’ burden on moving for class certification . . . is not merely to show that\nsome common issues exist, but, rather, to place substantial evidence in the record that\ncommon issues predominate.” (Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Superior Court (2003) 29\nCal.4th 1096, 1108 (Lockheed).) The “ ‘ultimate question’ for predominance is whether\n‘the issues which may be jointly tried, when compared with those requiring separate\nadjudication, are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would\nbe advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.’ ” (Duran v. U.S. Bank\nNational Association (2014) 59 Cal.4th 1, 28 (Duran), quoting Collins v. Rocha (1972) 7\nCal.3d 232, 238.) “ ‘ “As a general rule if the defendant’s liability can be determined by\nfacts common to all members of the class, a class will be certified even if the members\nmust individually prove their damages.” ’ ” (Duran, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 28, quoting\nBrinker, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 1021-1022.) In addition to finding predominance, the\ntrial court “must also conclude that litigation of individual issues . . . can be managed\nfairly and efficiently.” (Duran at pp. 28-29.)\n       “Predominance is a factual question; accordingly, the trial court’s finding that\ncommon issues predominate generally is reviewed for substantial evidence. [Citation.]\nWe must ‘[p]resume[e] in favor of the certification order . . . the existence of every fact\nthe trial court could reasonably deduce from the record. . . .’ ” (Brinker, supra, 53\nCal.4th at 1022, quoting Sav-on, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 329.)\n              2.     Negligence\n       The trial court concluded that plaintiff had failed to meet his burden to\ndemonstrate that defendant’s liability and the causal link between any breach by\ndefendant and any damage suffered by the plaintiff could be established by common facts\nor evidence. ~(AA 205)~ Plaintiff argues that the court erroneously focused on the\nindividual facts of each class member. Plaintiff asserts that defendant was negligent\n\n\n                                             14\n\fregardless of each class member’s individual circumstances “because [defendant’s] letter\nasserts, against the policy of the [LACSC] and what had actually been determined at the\ntime the letter was sent, that those who had been cited were guilty (determined to owe\nmoney) and induced its recipients to pay by the undue demands and threats which were\nmade, thus causing harm.” He thus asserts that the “class had a right to be free from\nletters which were based on [defendant’s] failure to know and take heed of [LACSC’s]\npolicy and the actual legal status that policy indicates.”\n       The flaw in plaintiff’s argument is that whether LACSC’s red-light citation\npolicies constitute common proof as to defendant’s liability necessarily depends on the\nexistence of a uniform policy with which defendant’s letters did not comply. The trial\ncourt determined that plaintiff had failed to support his theory regarding LACSC’s policy\n(and, by extension, defendant’s liability). The court’s finding is supported by the record,\nor more accurately, by the lack of substantial evidence from plaintiff. The sum total of\nplaintiff’s evidence on this critical point is: (1) statements by Bochner in his declaration\nin support of class certification as to what LACSC’s policies are (statements which\nmirror allegations in the complaint); (2) two small charts from LACSC labeled “Clerical\nAuthority,” which suggest that when a defendant fails to appear in a “photo enforcement”\ncase, a failure to appear violation will not issue, and the DMV is not informed, but a $250\ndelinquency fee is assessed and the account is referred to collections; and (3) three news\nstories and unattributed notes of what a LACSC official stated regarding the court’s\npolicies.\n       As to the news stories and unattributed notes, it is not clear whether the trial court\nreceived these documents in evidence. As we have noted, Bochner attached these\ndocuments as exhibits to his supplemental brief and declaration in support of class\ncertification. At the class certification hearing, defendant objected to the admission of\nthese documents, remarking that defendant had “repeatedly objected” to these “press\nreleases and . . . what has been submitted” by Bochner. Defense counsel noted that the\ncourt “has previously instructed Mr. Bochner not to make arguments concerning that, and\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fyet we’re back here again arguing about that.” The trial court did not rule on this\nobjection at the hearing.\n       If the trial court did not admit these documents (i.e., the news stories and\nunattributed notes), then plaintiff’s remaining evidence on this point (the “Clerical\nAuthority” charts) did not support plaintiff’s theory. The “Clerical Authority” charts do\nnot address plaintiff’s contention that LACSC does not issue default judgments in these\ncases or that various collection methods are not permitted. Assuming, however, the trial\ncourt admitted the news stories and unattributed notes, the trial court’s order implicitly\nfound that they, too, failed to support plaintiff’s theory that defendant’s liability could be\nbased on LACSC’s policies. (See Lockheed, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 1108 [stating that\nplaintiff’s burden is to place “substantial evidence” in the record that common issues\npredominate].)5 This implicit determination was not an abuse of discretion.\n       The trial court also found that whether defendant breached its duty or caused\ndamage to class members would require individual inquiries. To determine whether a\ndefendant owes a duty to a plaintiff for purposes of a negligence cause of action, a court\nis required to balance various factors which include “ ‘the foreseeability of harm to\n[plaintiff], the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, [and] the closeness of\nthe connection between the defendant’s conduct and the injury suffered.’ ” (Dept. of Fish\n\n       5\n           In concluding that plaintiff’s theory was unsupported, the trial court carefully\nanalyzed the evidence in support of plaintiff’s allegations that it was “LACSC’s policy\n. . . not [to] allow default judgments, liens, garnishment or levies with respect to red light\ncamera violations and it does not report the citations to the DMV,” and concluded that it\nwas unsupported. “This theory is not supported by the evidence submitted in support of\nplaintiff’s motion for class certification. Plaintiff relies primarily on evidence of two\ncourt procedures regarding the processing of red light camera citations. The first\nprovides that, when a party receiving a red light camera citation fails to appear, the court\nclerk will add a $250 delinquency fee, send a Notice of Delinquency Letter and then refer\nthe case to GCS for collections. The second provides that instead of notifying the DMV\nof the red light camera citee’s failure to appear, a $250 civil assessment is imposed and\nthe citation is referred to collections. The standing order further grants the court clerk\nauthority to enter dismissals on red light camera citations when the issuing policy agency\ninforms the court that the person cited was not the driver of the vehicle.” (Emphasis\nadded.)\n\n\n                                              16\n\f& Game v. Superior Court (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1357, quoting Biakanja v.\nIrving (1958) 49 Cal.2d 647, 650.) Foreseeability of harm is the key factor in this\nanalysis. (Dept. of Fish & Game v. Superior Court, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1357.)\nWhether defendant could reasonably foresee that its collection letter would cause damage\nto the class would turn on (1) whether the class member was, in fact, the driver of the car\nthat was photographed running a red light and (2) what the defendant knew, or should\nhave known, of those circumstances, and (3) what court proceedings had taken place on\nthe citation. Plaintiff has not demonstrated how these issues could be determined through\ncommon proof.\n       Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in rejecting his request to employ a class\n“notice” in which each class member would state whether she had received defendant’s\nletter and read it. He contends this would have eliminated the need for individualized\ninquiries. The trial court found such a “notice” would serve as a mere “discovery\nquestionnaire.” The trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting such a device.\nWhile the proposed notice might help narrow the class, plaintiff has not demonstrated\nhow this notice would obviate the need for individual inquiries to establish defendant’s\nliability as to each class member.\n       For the first time on appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court should have\nconsidered certifying an “issues only” or “liability only” class. This argument is waived\nbecause plaintiff did not raise either alternative before the trial court. (Newton v.\nClemons (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1, 11.) Conceding that he did not raise the argument\nbelow, plaintiff argues we should consider it anyway because it is a question of law and\ndefendant would suffer no prejudice. We decline to do so. Trial courts are “ideally\nsituated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action” (Linder,\nsupra, 23 Cal.4th at p. 435), and we will not make that determination in the first instance.\n       In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that plaintiff\nfailed to establish that common issues predominated over individual issues as to his\nnegligence claim.\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f              3.      Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation\n       The trial court denied class certification as to plaintiff’s misrepresentation-based\ncauses of action on the ground that plaintiff had not shown that either the falsity of many\nof defendants’ representations or the class members’ reliance on those representations\nwere subject to common proof.\n       To prevail on a fraud claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) a misrepresentation;\n(2) knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to defraud; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting\ndamage. (Belasco v. Wells (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 409, 424 (Belasco).) “The same\nelements comprise a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, except there is no\nrequirement of intent to induce reliance.” (Cadlo v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. (2004) 125\nCal.App.4th 513, 519 (Cadlo).) Accordingly, under both causes of action, plaintiffs must\nplead actual reliance on the alleged misrepresentation. (Ibid.)\n       We begin by addressing the trial court’s reliance finding. Plaintiff argues that the\nputative class members’ reliance should be presumed because the entire class was\nexposed to uniform misrepresentations contained in defendant’s letter. Plaintiff is correct\nthat in certain cases, reliance can be presumed on behalf of a class. For example, in\nVasquez v. Superior Court (1971) 4 Cal.3d 800 (Vasquez), the Supreme Court addressed\na fraud action where the defendant’s salespeople “memorized a standard statement\ncontaining the representations (which in turn were based on a printed narrative and sales\nmanual) and that this statement was recited by rote to every member of the class.” (Id. at\npp. 811-812.) In these circumstances, the court stated if “the trial court finds material\nmisrepresentations were made to the class members, at least an inference of reliance\nwould arise as to the entire class.” (Id. at p. 814; see also Mirkin v. Wasserman (1993) 5\nCal.4th 1082, 1094 [noting that reliance was a common issue in Vasquez based on the\n“peculiar facts of the case”]; Occidental Land, Inc. v. Superior Court (1976) 18 Cal.3d\n355, 358 [finding inference of class-wide reliance where material misrepresentations\nwere made in a public report and each class member had been “obligated to read the\nreport and state in writing that he had done so.”].) Similarly, in Metowski v. Traid Corp.\n(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 332, the court addressed a situation where a putative class action\n\n\n                                              18\n\fcomplaint alleged “19 identical misrepresentations were made in writing to each member\nof the class. If the representations were in fact made in writing to each member of the\nclass, and plaintiffs thereupon entered into the contracts of purchase as alleged, then a\npersuasive inference of reliance upon the representations arises without the necessity of\ntestimony on that issue from each individual member of the class.” (Id. at p. 338.)\n       In contrast to these cases, courts have recognized that where “the issue of . . .\nreliance . . . is a matter that would vary from consumer to consumer, the issue is not\nsubject to common proof, and the action is properly not certified as a class action.”\n(Tucker v. Pacific Bell Mobile Services (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 201, 222 (Tucker).)\nThus, in Tucker, plaintiff sought to represent a class of consumers alleging that a cellular\nphone service provider failed to disclose its practice of “rounding up” its customers\npartially used airtime minutes, reducing the number of minutes the customer could use.\nThe court found that reliance could not be established on a class-wide basis because “the\npurported misrepresentations were communicated to class members through a variety of\nwritten materials, through the mail, via the Internet, by telephone and in retail stores.”\n(Tucker, supra, 208 Cal.App.4th at p. 224.)6 The court noted that it was not even clear if\nthe members of the class had seen or relied on any of the alleged misrepresentations. (Id.\nat p. 221; see also Davis-Miller v. Automobile Club of Southern California (2011) 201\nCal.App.4th 106, 125 [holding no inference of class-wide reliance could be made where\nthe evidence showed the alleged misrepresentations were made in a small number of\nplaces and thus likely did not reach most class members].) Similarly, in Sotelo v.\n\n       6\n         Plaintiff argues that Tucker “did not speak as to the standard on class\ncertification at all, as it was not based on a class certification motion.” While plaintiff is\ncorrect that Tucker did not involve a class certification motion, its holding most certainly\ndid speak to the class certification standard. Tucker involved an appeal after a trial court\nhad sustained a demurrer on plaintiff’s class allegations. A trial court can only sustain a\ndemurrer on class allegations where it “concludes as a matter of law that, assuming the\ntruth of the factual allegations in the complaint, there is no reasonable possibility that the\nrequirements for class certification will be satisfied.” (Bridgeford v. Pacific Health Corp.\n(2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1034, 1041-1042.) Accordingly, the analysis in Tucker involved\nan application of the class certification standard, albeit in a distinct procedural posture.\n\n\n                                             19\n\fMediaNews Group, Inc. (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 639 (Sotelo), we found that a class\nmember’s reliance on representations in a contract could not be presumed; “although\neach putative class member . . . signed [the contract], reliance may not be presumed\nunless there is a showing that putative class members actually read their contracts.” (Id.\nat p. 656.)\n       In this case, the trial court found that reliance could not be inferred because “[a]\nClass member who took any steps to dispute the asserted fine, paid a fine that was not\nactually owed or suffered any other damages, may have done so for any number of\nreasons. He may have relied on the red light letter from [defendant] but he may have also\nrelied on [defendant’s] other collection efforts or taken action in response to prior\ncorrespondence from LACSC.” It thus concluded that “whether class members relied on\nthe alleged misrepresentations in the red light letter requires consideration of\nindividualized proof and is not a proper subject for determination on a class-wide basis.”\n       Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding. Although plaintiff has\npresented evidence that each putative class member received substantially similar letters\nfrom defendant, the record also suggests that putative class members received other\ncommunications that made direct demands for payment. For example, plaintiff submitted\na copy of his “Notice of Traffic Violation” from the Culver City Police Department\nasserting that plaintiff had to “pay or deposit” $381 to LACSC for the charged violation.\nThe Cole declaration reveals that defendant engages in collection efforts separate from\nthe challenged letter, such as the use of different letters and collection phone calls. As\nCole stated in his declaration, while defendant can determine whether an individual paid\nin full or in part, it cannot determine which communication caused the class member to\npay. Any of these communications could have been the motivating force behind a class\nmember’s decision to pay the asserted balance. Because the record shows that many\nclass members received a variety of targeted communications regarding their obligation\nto pay LACSC, we conclude that this is not a case where reliance can be presumed\nsimply because each class member received the challenged letter. Rather, the variety of\ncommunications the class members received makes this a case where the issue of reliance\n\n\n                                             20\n\f“is a matter that would vary from consumer to consumer” and thus is not subject to\ncommon proof (Tucker, supra, 208 Cal.App.4th at p. 222), and the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in so finding.\n       The record also supports the trial court’s finding that plaintiff had failed to show\nthat the falsity of many of defendant’s representations was subject to common proof.\nDefendant’s representation that plaintiff had a balance owing to LACSC was false\nbecause of plaintiff’s unique circumstances as an alleged victim of identity theft. As the\ntrial court recognized, however, “whether other class members owed money to LACSC\nmay be true if the person receiving the letter was the driver pictured in the citation and he\nhad failed to appear and/or timely pay the citation.” The court also concluded that\nplaintiff had failed to demonstrate that the alleged false representation that the DMV was\nhelping to locate class members was subject to common proof. For the reasons discussed\nabove in the context of plaintiff’s negligence cause of action, these findings are supported\nby plaintiff’s failure to present substantial evidence regarding LACSC’s policies.\nWithout evidence suggesting a common LACSC policy that rendered defendant’s\nrepresentations false or misleading as to the entire class, the question of falsity would\nnecessarily turn on each individual’s case.7\n       Substantial evidence thus supports the trial court’s conclusion that reliance and\nfalsity are not subject to common proof. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying plaintiff’s motion to certify plaintiff’s fraud and negligent\nmisrepresentation causes of action.\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         Plaintiff contends that the trial court ignored authority that a “technically true\nstatement can be deceptive if it is couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or\ndeceive,” citing two cases, Day v. AT&T (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 325 and Massachusetts\nMutual v. Superior Court (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1282. Although a technically true\nstatement can be misleading, this does not aid plaintiff because he failed to introduce\nsufficient evidence that the representations were made in a manner that was likely to\nmislead or deceive each class member, for the reasons discussed above.\n\n\n                                               21\n\f              4.     UCL\n       Like plaintiff’s fraud and misrepresentation claim, the trial court denied\ncertification of plaintiff’s UCL cause of action on the grounds that plaintiff had failed to\nintroduce sufficient evidence that the falsity of defendant’s representations and the class\nmembers’ reliance on those representations were subject to common proof. On appeal,\nplaintiff contends that the trial court erred in its analysis because the UCL does not\nrequire a class plaintiff to present individualized evidence regarding class members’\nreliance.\n       A UCL action is equitable in nature and has limited remedies; prevailing plaintiffs\nare limited to injunctive relief and restitution. (In re Tobacco II Cases (2009) 46 Cal.4th\n298, 312 (Tobacco II).) The fraud-prong of the UCL has been understood as distinct\nfrom common law fraud. “ ‘A [common law] fraudulent deception must be actually\nfalse, known to be false by the perpetrator and reasonably relied upon by a victim who\nincurs damages. None of these elements are required to state a claim for injunctive relief’\nunder the UCL.” (Ibid, quoting Day v. AT&T Corp., supra, 63 Cal.App.4th at p. 332.)\n“A fraudulent practice under the UCL ‘require[s] only a showing that members of the\npublic are likely to be deceived’ and ‘can be shown even without allegations of actual\ndeception, reasonable reliance and damage.’ ” (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing,\nLP (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 81, quoting Daugherty v. American Honda Motor Co.,\nInc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 824, 838.)\n       While the scope of the UCL “remains expansive,” in 2004, the California voters\n“materially curtailed the universe of those who may enforce [its] provisions” by enacting\nProposition 64. (Kwikset Corporation v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 320.)\nProposition 64 limits private standing under the UCL to any “ ‘person who has suffered\ninjury in fact and has lost money or property’ as a result of unfair competition.” (Ibid,\nquoting Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17204.) In Tobacco II, the Supreme Court addressed the\nimpact that Proposition 64’s new standing requirement had on UCL class actions.\nTobacco II was a class action brought by smokers against the tobacco companies alleging\nthat the companies’ marketing and advertising violated the UCL. After Proposition 64\n\n\n                                             22\n\fwas enacted, the trial court decertified the class, finding that each absent class member\nwas now required to show that they suffered an injury in fact as a result of the alleged\nunfair competition. (Tobacco II, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 306.) The Supreme Court found\ndecertification was improper. It held that Proposition 64 “was not intended to, and does\nnot, impose [Business and Professions Code] section 17204’s standing requirements on\nabsent class members in a UCL class action where class requirements have otherwise\nbeen found to exist.” (Id. at p. 324.) Thus, “relief under the UCL is available [to absent\nclass members] without individualized proof of deception, reliance and injury” so long as\nthe class representative meets Proposition 64 standing requirements. (Id. at p. 320, see\nalso Medrazo v. Honda of North Hollywood (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1, 11 [“When the\nprivate action is brought as a class action, only the named plaintiff is required to meet this\nstanding requirement.”].)\n       Relying on Tobacco II, plaintiff here contends that the trial court erred in\nconcluding that he needed to demonstrate that the class members’ reliance was subject to\ncommon proof for purposes of the UCL cause of action. However, the trial court’s\nfinding on this ground finds support from a line of cases. For example, in Cohen v.\nDIRECTV, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 966 (Cohen), the court stated “Tobacco II held\nthat, for purposes of standing in context of the class certification issue . . . involving the\nUCL, the class members need not be assessed for the element of reliance. Or, in other\nwords, class certification may not be defeated on the ground of lack of standing upon a\nshowing that class members did not rely on false advertising.” (Id. at p. 981.) The court\nthen found Tobacco II “irrelevant” to the question of commonality in the class\ncertification context “because the issue of ‘standing’ simply is not the same thing as the\nissue of ‘commonality.’ ” (Ibid.) The court thus concluded that the trial court correctly\nconsidered that the fact that plaintiff’s UCL claim “would involve factual questions\nassociated with their reliance on DIRECTV’s alleged false representations” in denying\ncertification. (Ibid.) Other decisions, such as Tucker (the decision on which the trial\ncourt here relied), have cited Cohen’s analysis approvingly. (Tucker, supra, 208\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\fCal.App.4th at pp. 227-228; Knapp v. AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. (2011) 195\nCal.App.4th 932, 945.)\n       Plaintiff, however, cites dicta from in In re Steroid Hormone Product Cases\n(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 145, to support his argument that proof of class-wide reliance is\nnot necessary in the UCL context. There, the court discussed Cohen’s reasoning and\nstated “We agree that Tobacco II did not dispense with the commonality requirement for\nclass certification. But to the extent the appellate court’s opinion might be understood to\nhold that plaintiffs must show class members’ reliance on the alleged misrepresentations\nunder the UCL, we disagree. As Tobacco II made clear, Proposition 64 did not change\nthe substantive law governing UCL claims, other than the standing requirements for the\nnamed plaintiffs, and ‘before Proposition 64, “California courts have repeatedly held that\nrelief under the UCL is available without individualized proof of deception, reliance and\ninjury.” [Citation.]’ ” (Id. at p. 158, quoting Tobacco II, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 326.)\nOther courts have similarly rejected Cohen’s reasoning. (See Greenwood v. Compucredit\nCorp. (N.D. Cal. 2010) 2010 WL 4807095 at p. *5 [“To the extent that the court of\nappeal’s decision in Cohen might be read to require individualized evidence of class\nmembers’ reliance, it is inconsistent with Tobacco II.”].). Other courts have more\ngenerally recognized that the UCL does not require a showing of individualized proof of\nmateriality, reliance, or damage. For example, in, Weinstat v. Dentsply International,\nInc. (2010) 180 Cal.App.4th 1213, the court, in the standing context, held that the “trial\ncourt incorrectly believed that each class member must establish standing, thereby\nrequiring the court to delve into individual proof of material, reliance and resulting\ndamage.” (Id. at p. 1224; see also Pfizer Inc. v. Superior Court (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th\n622, 631 [noting that “relief under the UCL is available without individualized proof of\ndeception, reliance and injury”].)\n       Ultimately, we do not need to address in this case whether, or to what extent, a\nplaintiff asserting a UCL claim on behalf of the class is required to demonstrate that\nreliance can be subject to common proof. As discussed below, the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in finding that plaintiff’s claims are not typical of the class and that\n\n\n                                              24\n\fthe class did not have adequate legal representation. These two grounds provide\nsufficient, independent grounds for affirming the trial court’s order as to plaintiff’s UCL\nclaims. For the same reason, the trial court’s failure to assess whether plaintiff’s unfair-\nprong UCL claim should be certified does not require reversal.\n              5.      Declaratory Relief\n       Plaintiffs’ fourth cause of action asserted a claim for declaratory relief. This cause\nof action sought two different declarations. First, plaintiff sought a declaration that “it is\nnegligent or either a negligent or intentional misrepresentation for Defendants to suggest\nand seek response in light of actual lack of facts supporting an obligation due and owing\nand to suggest associations with the DMV that it does not have and that it may not do so\nin the future.” Second, plaintiff sought a “declaration of rights and duties regarding\nwhether Defendants were debt collecting under the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection\nPractices Act [RFDCPA].” Plaintiff sought this latter declaration because defendant had\n“raised the issue . . . whether they have certain defenses under the [RFDCPA] and\ntherefore the issue of whether they were debt collecting when they sent the letter in\nquestion herein.” Plaintiff alleged that “[i]f so, it appears Defendants violated certain\nnotice provisions under the [RFDCPA] . . . . If not, they have no such defenses.” Plaintiff\ndid not assert a cause of action under the RFDCPA or seek a declaration that defendant\nhad, in fact, violated RFDCPA provisions.\n       In addressing this claim, the trial court noted defendant’s position that plaintiff had\nfailed to properly seek class certification of this claim and defendant’s request to file a\nsupplemental brief if the court were to consider class certification nonetheless. The court\nfound that further briefing was unnecessary because the “court has ultimately determined\nthat certification of all causes of action is improper under the circumstances of this case.”\nNevertheless, the court addressed the merits of whether plaintiff had shown that common\nissues predominated as to the declaratory relief cause of action. To the extent that\nplaintiff sought a declaration that defendant was negligent or had engaged in\nmisrepresentations, the trial court found that “[a]s with plaintiff’s negligence and\nmisrepresentation claims, common issues do not predominate because resolution of these\n\n\n                                              25\n\fquestions necessarily requires individualized inquiries.” The trial court, however, found\nthat plaintiff had “submitted sufficient evidence to show that common issues predominate\nin determining whether GCS is a ‘debt collector’ as defined by the Act and whether its\nactions—the representations in the red light letter – were consistent with the Act.”\n       Defendant has not filed a cross-appeal regarding the trial court’s finding that\ncommon issues predominate as to whether it is a “debt collector” within the meaning of\nthe RFDCPA, so we do not reach this issue. Plaintiff, on the other hand, has argued that\nthe trial court erred in failing to certify the declaratory judgment cause of action in its\nentirety because predominance need not be shown for a declaratory judgment action.\nWhile plaintiff raised this argument in his reply brief before the trial court, the trial court\nnever addressed it. Plaintiff’s argument, however, is without merit.\n       Plaintiff relies entirely on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) (Rule\n23(b)(2)). Rule 23(b)(2) permits class certification in federal court where “the party\nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,\nso that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting\nthe class as a whole.” (Rule. 23(b)(2).) The United States Supreme Court has held that\nthe “key to the (b)(2) class is ‘the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory\nremedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared\nunlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.’ [Citation.]” (Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v . Dukes (2011) ___ U.S. ___, [131 S.Ct. 2541, 2557] (Wal-Mart).)\nThe court further noted that “ ‘[c]ivil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful,\nclass-based discrimination are prime examples’ of what (b)(2) is meant to capture.\n[Citation.] In particular, the Rule reflects a series of decisions involving challenges to\nracial segregation—conduct that was remedied by a single classwide order.” (Id. at pp.\n2557-2558.) Where a Rule 23(b)(2) class is asserted, the predominance and superiority\nrequirements of Rule 23(b)(3) need not be met. (See, e.g., Gates v. Rohm & Haas Co.\n(3d Cir. 2011) 655 F.3d 255, 263-264.)\n       Plaintiff has failed to cite any California state court case that relies on Rule\n23(b)(2) to permit class certification without a showing that common issues predominate,\n\n\n                                              26\n\fand we have found none.8 Plaintiff cites the general proposition that California courts\n“have sought guidance from both Civil Code section 1781 regarding consumer class\nactions and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 23, in the absence of state\nprecedent.” (Reyes v. Board of Supervisors (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1263, 1271.) As\ndetailed above, however, there is state precedent on the predominance requirement. Our\nSupreme Court has expressly interpreted the “common . . . interest” requirement of Code\nof Civil Procedure section 382 as requiring “predominant common questions of law or\nfact.” (Brinker, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 1021.) Additionally, Civil Code section 1781,\nreferenced by the Reyes court, permits class actions only where “questions of law or fact\ncommon to the class are substantially similar and predominate over the questions\naffecting the individual members.” (Civ. Code, § 1781, subd. (b)(2).) In Capitol People\nFirst v. Department of Developmental Services (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 676 (Capitol\nPeople First), a case cited by plaintiff, the court found that the trial court had correctly\nlooked to Rule 23(b)(2) for guidance on whether plaintiffs’ disability discrimination\nclaims were suitable for class treatment. (Id. at p. 691, fn.12.) The court nonetheless\nrecognized that “[i]t is the burden of the proponent of class certification to show, with\nsubstantial evidence, that common questions of law or fact predominate over questions\naffecting individual members.” (Id. at p. 689.) Accordingly, we question whether\nCalifornia law permits a court to ignore the predominance requirement in assessing a\nclass certification motion.\n       However, even assuming plaintiff is correct, plaintiff has not established that his\nclaims satisfy the Rule 23(b)(2) standard for certification. For the reasons discussed\nabove, plaintiff failed to produce sufficient evidence demonstrating that defendant “acted\nor refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class” such that class wide\n\n       8\n        While California courts have utilized Rule 23(b)(2), for example, in determining\nwhether notice to the putative class and an opportunity to opt-out of the class must be\nprovided, these decisions are silent as to whether or not predominance must be shown for\nsuch class actions in California state court. (See, e.g., Carter v. City of Los Angeles\n(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 808, 823; Frazier v. City of Richmond (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d\n1491; Bell v. American Title Ins. Co. (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1589.)\n\n\n                                              27\n\finjunctive or declaratory relief was appropriate. (Capitol People First, supra, 155\nCal.App.4th at p. 691.) Specifically, plaintiff failed to introduce evidence that\ndefendant’s liability could be established through class wide proof, as opposed to an\nindividualized determination of each class member’s circumstances or what defendant\nknew, or should have known, about those circumstances. Thus, based on the record\nplaintiff established before the trial court, it does not appear that defendant’s conduct is\nsuch that it can be “declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of\nthem.” (Wal-Mart, supra, 131 S.Ct. at p. 2557.)\n       Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that common\nquestions did not predominate to the extent that plaintiff’s declaratory relief cause of\naction sought a declaration that defendant had been negligent or engaged in\nmisrepresentations.9\nB.     Typicality\n       The trial court found that plaintiff’s negligence or misrepresentation claims were\nnot typical of the class as he was neither the driver nor owner of the car subject to the\nred-light citation and had received the defendant’s letter as the result of his identity being\nstolen. On appeal, plaintiff argues that “[h]e is typical of others who were given a letter\nwhich concealed and threatened with falsities the true status of the citations and the\nconsequences of not immediately paying them.”\n       “Certification requires a showing that the class representative has claims or\ndefenses typical of the class.” (Fireside Bank, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 1090.) “ ‘It is the\nfact that the class plaintiff’s claims are typical and his representation of the class adequate\nwhich gives legitimacy to permitting him to bind class members who have notice of the\naction.’ ” (Caro, supra, 18 Cal.App.4th at p. 664, quoting Trotsky v. Los Angeles Fed.\n\n       9\n         Our holding applies equally to plaintiff’s requests for injunctive relief to the\nextent they are pled in his substantive causes of action. While the trial court did not\nseparately address his requests for injunctive relief in each of his substantive claims, in\nlight of our holding, the trial court’s finding that common issues did not predominate as\nto the negligence and misrepresentation causes of action was also sufficient to deny\ncertification as to the claims for injunctive relief.\n\n\n                                              28\n\fSav. & Loan Assn. (1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 134, 146.) Typicality does not require a\nshowing that plaintiffs’ claims are identical to those of other class members, only that\ntheir claims are sufficiently similar. (See Classen v. Weller (1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 27,\n46.) “ ‘[T]here can be no class certification unless it is determined by the trial court that\nsimilarly situated persons have sustained damage. There can be no cognizable class\nunless it is first determined that members who make up the class have sustained the same\nor similar damage.’ ” (Caro, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 664, quoting Guidotti v. County of\nYolo (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1552, 1566-1567.)\n       On this record, substantial evidence supports the trial court’s conclusion that\nplaintiff’s claims were not typical of the proposed class. “Although difference in\ncomputing damages is not sufficient to deny class certification, differences in the actual\nexistence of damages or in the manner of incurring damages are appropriate\nconsiderations.” (Caro, supra, 18 Cal.App.4th at p. 665.) In Caro, a plaintiff sought to\nrepresent a class of consumers who had been misled by defendant’s claim that its orange\njuice was “fresh.” Plaintiff’s evidence, however, suggested that plaintiff was not\ndeceived by the “fresh” claim, but rather had been misled by defendant’s claim that the\njuice was “premium.” (Id. at p. 664.) The court affirmed the denial of class certification,\nstating “[b]ecause Caro did not claim to be misled in the manner the class was allegedly\ndeceived, the court could not ‘decide the issue of the rights of such individuals that might\npossibly exist.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) In this case, when plaintiff received defendant’s\nletter, he knew he had not been in Southern California in over seven years and that he had\nnever received any citation there. He therefore knew that he did not owe money to\nLACSC. Further, he knew he was the victim of identity theft and had reason to suspect\nthat this was the reason he had received defendant’s letter. As a result, while plaintiff\nalleges that the class members were misled into paying the balance listed in defendant’s\nletter, plaintiff himself was not misled in this way. Therefore, plaintiff’s manner of\n\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\fincurring damages (retaining an attorney to send a letter to defendant stating that he was\nan identity theft victim) is distinct from those of the putative class.10\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiff’s claims were\nnot typical of the class.11\nC.     Adequacy of Representation\n       The trial court concluded that plaintiff failed to meet his burden of showing that\nhis counsel, Ron Bochner, was qualified to serve as class counsel. On appeal, plaintiff\ncontends that Bochner’s qualifications were sufficiently established and that a prior\nfinding in an unrelated matter that Bochner engaged in questionable litigation tactics did\nnot support a finding that Bochner was unqualified to serve as class counsel in this action.\n\n\n\n       10\n          We note that plaintiff’s fraud and negligent misrepresentation causes of action\nboth require a finding that the class member reasonably relied on an alleged\nmisrepresentation. (Belasco, supra, 234 Cal.App.4th at p. 424; Cadlo, supra, 125\nCal.App.4th at p. 519.) “ ‘Several courts have held that class certification is\ninappropriate where a putative class representative is subject to unique defenses which\nthreaten to become the focus of the litigation.’ ” (Seastrom v. Neways, Inc. (2007) 149\nCal.App.4th 1496, 1502.) Because plaintiff knew he had been the victim of identity theft\nand knew he did not owe a fine, it appears plaintiff may be subject to a reliance defense\nthat is “unavailable or less available against other class members.” (Id. at p. 1503.) We\nneed not address whether defendant’s reliance defense against plaintiff would warrant\ndenial of certification in light of our conclusion that plaintiff has not established he was\nmisled in the way the unnamed class members were allegedly misled.\n       11\n          As we have stated, plaintiff’s declaratory relief claim involved two separate\nprongs—one seeking a declaration that defendant engaged in negligence or\nmisrepresentations by sending the letter and one seeking a declaration that defendant was\nengaged in debt collecting under the RFDCPA. As to the latter prong, the trial court\nfound plaintiff’s claims were “typical of other plaintiffs under the debt collection prong\nof his declaratory relief cause of action because he received the same type of letter as all\nother asserted class members.” Plaintiff contends that if his claims were typical under the\nRFDCPA prong of his declaratory relief claim, they are typical as to the other prong as\nwell: “whether [defendant’s] letter was legally appropriate or subject to the RFDCPA –\nare not readily distinguishable. It appears if he was typical for the one he was typical for\nthe other.” Because we find in the following section that plaintiff failed to meet his\nburden to establish the adequacy of his representation, we need not address this\nargument.\n\n\n                                              30\n\fIn the alternative, plaintiff argues that the trial court should have appointed replacement\nclass counsel, rather than denying certification of the entire class.\n       “In order for the representative to adequately represent the class, the\nrepresentative’s attorney must be qualified, experienced and generally able to conduct the\nproposed litigation.” (Miller v. Woods (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 862, 874; see also\nMcGhee v. Bank of America (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 442, 450 [“Adequacy of\nrepresentation depends on whether the plaintiff’s attorney is qualified to conduct the\nproposed litigation . . . .”].) “ ‘[T]he Court has an obligation to closely scrutinize the\nqualifications of counsel to assure that all interests, including those of as yet unnamed\nplaintiffs are adequately represented. . . . Precisely because of the responsibility to absent\nclass members, counsel’s qualifications in the class action context are subject to a\n‘heightened standard.’ ” (Cal Pak Delivery, Inc. v. United Parcel Service, Inc. (1997) 52\nCal.App.4th 1, 12 (Cal Pak), quoting Palumbo v. Tele-Communications, Inc. (D.D.C.\n1994) 157 F.R.D. 129, 132-133.)\n       To begin, plaintiff argues on appeal that the “existence of the elements of adequate\nrepresentation are presumed” and that the “ ‘burden is on the defendant to demonstrate\nthat the representation will be inadequate.’ ” Plaintiff relies on a single case for this\nproposition—the 1984 decision by the federal district court in In re School Asbestos\nLitigation (E.D. Pa. 1984) 104 F.R.D. 422, 430, afirmed in part, reversed in part (3d Cir.)\n789 F.2d 996.12 However, our Supreme Court has squarely held that “[t]he party seeking\n\n       12\n           In re School Asbestos Litigation does not appear to be an accurate statement of\nfederal law. The decision relied on the Third Circuit’s decision in Lewis v. Curtis (3d\nCir. 1982) 671 F.2d 779. Lewis, however, was addressing class certification in a\nshareholder derivative action brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1.\n(Id. at p. 784.) Federal decisions recognize that “ ‘[i]n the context of a derivative suit\nunder Rule 23.1, courts have generally found that the defendant has the burden of\nshowing that the plaintiff is an inadequate representative.’ ” (In re Facebook, Inc. IPO\nSecurities & Derivative Litigation (S.D.N.Y. 2013) 2013 WL 6798160 at p. *24, quoting\nIn re JPMorgan Chase & Co. Shareholder Derivative Litigation (S.D.N.Y. 2008) 2008\nWL 4298588 at p. *8.) For non-derivative class actions governed by Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23, however, plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing the adequacy of\nthe class representative. (See, e.g., Rattray v. Woodbury County, IA (8th Cir. 2010) 614\n\n                                              31\n\fclass certification has the burden of proving the adequacy of its representation.”\n(Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc. (1981) 29 Cal.3d 462, 470.) Similarly, in Sotelo, this\ncourt held that “[i]t is plaintiff’s burden to support each of the above factors [including\nadequacy of the class representative] with a factual showing.” (Sotelo, supra, 207\nCal.App.4th at p. 647.) Accordingly, plaintiff bore the burden of establishing Bochner’s\nadequacy as class counsel; defendant did not have to prove Bochner’s inadequacy.\n       Nor are we persuaded by plaintiff’s argument that Bochner’s qualifications should\nsimply have been “presumed.” Such a presumption is inconsistent with plaintiff’s burden\nto introduce sufficient evidence regarding adequacy of representation and this court’s\nobligation to “closely scrutinize” the qualifications of putative class counsel. (See Cal\nPak, supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at p. 12; see also Berger v. Compaq Computer Corp. (5th Cir.\n2001) 257 F.3d 475, 481 [“The district court unquestionably adopted an incorrect legal\nstandard by stating that ‘[t]he adequacy of the putative representatives and of plaintiffs’\ncounsel is presumed in the absence of specific proof to the contrary.’ This is error; the\nparty seeking certification bears the burden of establishing that all requirements of Rule\n23(a) have been satisfied.”].)\n       The trial court expressed valid concerns about Bochner’s qualifications to\nrepresent a class of more than 22,500 people. All Bochner stated in his declaration\nregarding his experience, qualifications and ability to represent such a large class was: “I\nam experienced in complex litigation. I have been named class counsel in eight cases, all\nof which settled or are in the process of settling, with money being distributed to the class\nand two other cases which are pending but have not been certified to date.” This\ndescription fails to provide any qualitative information about Bochner’s experience or\nability to conduct this litigation. He did not describe the size of the classes, the nature of\nthe litigation, or any information that would have permitted the trial court to assess\nwhether Bochner had the qualifications and experience necessary to represent the\n\n\nF.3d 831, 835; Wixon v. Wyndham Resort Development Corp. (N.D.Cal. 2009) 2009 WL\n3353445 at pp. *5, 9.)\n\n\n                                              32\n\fpotentially large class in this case. A well-known treatise advises attorneys on this\nsubject: “This is not the time to be modest about yourself. As part of your certification\nmotion, attach a résumé of your firm and each attorney who will be involved in the\naction. Detail your experience in prior class action litigation, indicating past cases in\nwhich you were involved, in what capacity, and the results obtained. At fairness hearings\nand hearings involving fee applications, judges occasionally will praise class counsel on\nthe record. Save any such transcripts and orders and quote these remarks in later motions\nas support for the proposition that class counsel is adequate.” (Weil & Brown, Cal.\nPractice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2011) ¶ 14:38.1.) By\ncontrast, where, as here, putative class counsel provides almost no details about their\nrelevant experience, they run the risk that the trial court will find them inadequate.13\n       The trial court’s concern about whether Bochner had the resources or capacity to\nadequately serve as counsel for such a large class also finds support in the record. First,\nBochner stated in his declaration that he was serving as class counsel in two putative\nclass actions. Bochner’s declaration, however, includes no statement regarding his\ncapacity to handle a large class action in light of those pending cases and his status as a\nsolo practitioner. Second, Bochner’s failure to timely pursue plaintiff’s claims or\ndiscovery against LACSC in this matter calls into question Bochner’s capacity to\ndiligently represent the class. This lawsuit was filed in July 2011 and plaintiff amended\nhis complaint four times. Yet plaintiff waited until December 2012 to add LACSC as a\nparty to the case. Three months later, the trial court granted LACSC’s demurrer without\nleave to amend because plaintiff had failed to file a timely claim pursuant to the\nGovernment Tort Claims Act. Further, class discovery opened in April 2012. Bochner,\nhowever, did not propound a subpoena to LACSC until July 2012 seeking documents on\n\n\n       13\n          Nor can it be said that the trial court’s concerns regarding Bochner’s resources\nor qualifications caught Bochner by surprise. The court issued a detailed tentative ruling\nexpressing its concerns regarding Bochner’s suitability as class counsel. Even after being\nmade aware of these concerns, however, Bochner failed to expand on his declaration’s\nmeager showing at the class certification hearing.\n\n\n                                             33\n\fLACSC’s red-light citation policies. When this did not yield sufficient information,\nplaintiff attempted to depose an LACSC official to have him or her confirm certain\nstatements county officials had made to the press regarding LACSC’s red-light citation\npolicies. Bochner did not issue a deposition subpoena, however, until May 17, 2013 (10\ndays before his reply brief in support of certification was filed). LACSC objected to this\nsubpoena as it failed to include a check to cover their expenses, so plaintiff issued a\nsecond subpoena on July 8, 2013, noticing a deposition for August 12, 2013—a mere\neight days before the class certification hearing. It was not until September 9, 2013, that\nBochner filed a motion to compel LACSC’s appearance at a deposition.\n       Our decision should not be read as holding that a solo practitioner can never serve\nas adequate class counsel, including in complex or large class actions. Rather, we hold\nthat given Bochner’s performance in this action as well as his failure to establish his\nqualifications before the trial court, substantial evidence supports the trial court’s\nconclusion that Bochner was not qualified to serve as class counsel in this case.\n       Plaintiff next argues that the trial court erred in finding Bochner an inadequate\nclass counsel based on the American Agencies court decision. Plaintiff contends that the\nstandard for finding inadequate class counsel based on an ethical challenge was not\nsatisfied. He relies on the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Reliable Money Order, Inc. v.\nMcKnight Sales Co., Inc. (7th Cir. 2013) 704 F.3d 489. In that case, the court inquired\ninto the nature of misconduct by an attorney in a class action warranting denial of class\ncertification. The court noted that “[n]ot any ethical breach justifies the grave option of\ndenying class certification. No doubt, misconduct that prejudices the class or creates a\ndirect conflict between counsel and the class requires such denial . . . . [¶] Nevertheless,\neven ‘serious’ or ‘major’ ethical violations – not prejudicial to the class – can require\ndenial of class certification.” (Id. at pp. 498-499.) The court articulated the following\nstandard: “unethical conduct, not necessarily prejudicial to the class, nevertheless raises\na ‘serious doubt’ about the adequacy of class counsel when the misconduct jeopardizes\nthe court’s ability to reach a just and proper outcome in the case.” (Id. at p. 499.)\n\n\n\n                                              34\n\f       Plaintiff argues that there “were no facts and no finding that [Bochner’s]\nrepresentation of the class would lead to an inability to reach a just and proper outcome in\nthis case” and, therefore, the “court’s denial of certification . . . on this basis appears to be\nbased on an erroneous assumption or improper criteria.” Plaintiff misreads the trial\ncourt’s order. After finding Bochner’s declaration regarding his qualifications inadequate\nfor the reasons discussed above, the court stated: “In light of these facts, the court finds\nthat plaintiff has not met his burden of showing Mr. Bochner is qualified to represent the\nproposed class. [¶] Even if plaintiff had met his burden, the court is concerned with\ncounsel’s competence to represent the proposed class in light of the findings of Judge\nBrick in . . . the Lee v. American Agencies case.” It is thus clear that plaintiff’s failure to\nestablish Bochner’s qualification was the reason the trial court found Bochner to be\ninadequate—not solely or necessarily Bochner’s actions in the American Agencies case.\nAs just discussed, this decision was not an abuse of discretion. (Linder, supra, 23 Cal.4th\nat p. 436 [“ ‘Any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.’ ”].)\nFurther, we reject plaintiff’s contention that the trial court erred by considering Bochner’s\nperformance in the American Agencies case. Even if not sufficiently serious to warrant\ndisqualification of counsel, bad faith or dubious litigation tactics by class counsel can\njeopardize class members’ claims. It was therefore not unreasonable for the trial court to\nconclude that prior findings by two courts that Bochner had engaged in such tactics cast\ndoubt on his ability to “competently represent the class.”14\n\n\n       14\n           Bochner has requested we take judicial notice of three documents that he\ncontends relate to the finding by the American Agencies court that he engaged in bad\nfaith litigation tactics. We grant the request for judicial notice of the Court of Appeal\ndecision that reversed the trial court’s award of attorneys’ fees. The trial court cited this\ndecision in its order in this case. (See Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d)(1).) We deny the\nrequest to take judicial notice of discovery responses Bochner received in the American\nAgencies case, and a superior court order overruling a demurrer in another of Bochner’s\ncases. Bochner contends that these two documents are relevant to show that he did not\nengage in “dubious litigation tactics” in the American Agencies case. We decline\nBochner’s invitation to relitigate Judge Brick’s findings or the Court of Appeal’s decision\nregarding his litigation tactics. (Jordan v. Superstar Sandcars (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th\n\n                                               35\n\f       Plaintiff’s final argument is that the trial court should have given him the\nopportunity to locate adequate counsel, rather than denying certification. As plaintiff’s\ncited authority makes clear, however, trial courts have “wide discretion to determine the\nremedial consequences” where class counsel is inadequate, and courts “may deny\ncertification outright.” (1 Newberg on Class Actions (5th ed. 2011) § 3.87, pp. 436-437.)\nThere are a number of examples of federal courts denying class certification solely based\non the inadequacy of class counsel. (See, e.g., Gomez v. St. Vincent Health, Inc. (7th Cir.\n2011) 649 F.3d 583, 592 [affirming class certification denial based solely on inadequacy\nof putative class counsel]; Niemeyer v. Williams (C.D. Ill. 2012) 910 F.Supp.2d 1116,\n1132 [“The inadequacy of class counsel can alone be grounds to deny certification of a\nclass.”]; Buckland v. Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2012) 2012 WL\n3705263 at p. *8 [“[B]ecause the Court concludes that Counsel are inadequate, the Court\nDENIES Plaintiffs’ Motion with respect to the Recruiter Class.”].)\n       Plaintiff (and Bochner) were on notice that defendant challenged Bochner’s ability\nto serve as class counsel. In its opposition brief to the motion for class certification,\ndefendant referenced the superior court’s findings in the American Agencies case and\nargued that “[t]he conduct documented by the [American Agencies] court casts\nsubstantial doubt on whether Attorney Bochner can effectively conduct this litigation and\nprotect the proposed class’s interest. As a result, the Court should deny the motion for\nclass certification.” In his reply brief, plaintiff responded to this argument, but did not\nraise the possibility that alternative counsel could be appointed to represent the class. It\nwas not until the class certification hearing on August 20, 2013, that Bochner raised the\npossibility that he could locate replacement counsel if the court determined he was\ninadequate. Even then, however, Bochner did not identify replacement counsel or\nindicate whether anyone was actually ready, willing, and able to step into the case which\n\n\n\n\n1416, 1421, fn. 2 [denying request to take judicial notice of documents not before the trial\ncourt at the time it made its ruling].)\n\n\n                                              36\n\fhad been pending since 2011. In these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying certification outright.\nD.     Substantial Benefit\n       As a final basis for denying class certification, the trial court found that a “class\naction is not the superior method of obtaining relief where proposed class counsel is not\nqualified and only a declaratory relief allegation, which may not provide complete relief\nto the class, appears to qualify for class treatment.” Plaintiff argues that the trial court\nabused its discretion in making this finding because plaintiff is, in fact, an adequate\nrepresentative and because he intends “to pursue all RFDCPA remedies based on the\ndeclaratory relief” cause of action.\n       “In determining the superiority of class treatment, the trial court must weigh the\nrespective benefits and burdens of class litigation; maintenance of the class action will\nonly be permitted where substantial benefits accrue to both the litigants and the court.”\n(Soderstedt v. CBIZ Southern California, LLC (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 133, 156.)\nSubstantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that plaintiff had failed to meet his\nburden of demonstrating that class treatment of his claims would provide a substantial\nbenefit to the parties and the court. The only claim that survived the trial court’s\ncommonality and typicality findings (findings which we have now affirmed) was a\ndeclaratory relief action seeking a declaration that defendant was engaged in debt\ncollection. Plaintiffs’ complaint, however, sought this declaration only to address a\npotential defense the defendant had raised in support of its demurrer to plaintiff’s\ncomplaint. Relief on such a narrow ground for the class would hardly constitute a\n“substantial benefit.” Nor can we say that class members would benefit at all from\nhaving their claim advanced by an inadequate representative.\n       Plaintiff asserts in his brief that he “does intend to pursue all RFDCPA remedies\nbased on the declaratory relief, just as stated in the [Fourth Amended Complaint].”\nHowever, his fourth amended complaint asserts no causes of action under the RFDCPA,\nnor does it seek a declaration that defendant violated the RFDCPA. Rather, in the\ncomplaint, plaintiff “seeks a declaration of rights and duties regarding whether\n\n\n                                                37\n\fDefendants were debt collecting under the [RFDCPA]. If so, it appears Defendants\nviolated certain notice provisions under the Act . . . . If not, they have no such defenses.”\nIt was not until the class certification hearing that plaintiff indicated his desire to amend\nhis complaint for a fifth time to assert these causes of action. Plaintiff renews this request\nbefore us, requesting in his opening brief that “if the court reverses on the adequacy\nissue, leave to amend to name RFDCPA causes be allowed.” Plaintiff’s belated requests\nfor leave to amend confirm the trial court’s finding that plaintiff’s declaratory relief cause\nof action, as currently pled, would fail to provide complete relief to the class.\nE.     Staying the Class Certification Hearing Pending Discovery\n       As we have discussed, substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that\nplaintiff failed to show that defendant’s liability could be established through common\nproof of LACSC’s policies. Plaintiff contends on appeal that LACSC failed to cooperate\nwith a deposition subpoena that sought to have a LACSC official testify regarding\nLACSC’s red-light camera citation policies. Plaintiff argues that if the evidence\nregarding LACSC’s policies was inadequate for class certification purposes, the trial\ncourt should have deferred ruling on his certification motion, rather than denying it.\n       To begin, plaintiff fails to properly raise this argument in his opening brief. His\nentire argument on this point consists of a two-sentence paragraph entirely devoid of\ncitations to the record or applicable legal authority. “Issues do not have a life of their\nown: if they are not raised or supported by argument or citation to authority, we consider\nthe issues waived.” (Jones v. Superior Court (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 92, 99.) Given\nplaintiffs’ failure to provide even a modicum of support in the record or case law for his\nposition that the trial court should have continued the class certification hearing, we deem\nthis argument waived.\n       However, even considering plaintiff’s arguments on the merits, we find no abuse\nof discretion. “The decision to grant or deny a continuance is committed to the sound\ndiscretion of the trial court.” (Forthmann v. Boyer (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 977, 984.) We\nwill not disturb the court’s ruling in the absence of a clear abuse of the court’s discretion.\n(Ibid.) The burden is on the party seeking a continuance to permit additional discovery to\n\n\n                                              38\n\fmake the request. Where a party fails to request that a motion be continued to allow for\nadditional discovery, the party waives any objection to the court ruling on the motion.\n(Lewinter v. Genmar Industries, Inc. (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1224 (Lewinter), see\nalso Jun Ki Kim v. True Church Members of Holy Hill Community Church (2015) 236\nCal.App.4th 1435, 1450 [“[A]ppellants waived their ability to argue they suffered\nprejudice because the record does not contain evidence they requested additional\ndiscovery or asked the court for additional time to conduct discovery about the recent\nevents.”].)\n       Plaintiff never unequivocally requested that the trial court continue the class\ncertification briefing or hearing to permit him to conduct additional class discovery.\nClass discovery in this matter opened on April 26, 2012. Plaintiff filed his certification\nmotion on September 28, 2012, without referencing any issues regarding LACSC\ndiscovery. In his reply brief, filed May 28, 2013, plaintiff first noted LACSC’s refusal to\ncomply with a deposition subpoena and stated that if the “court desires further evidence\non [LACSC’s] practices and policies, plaintiff asks leave to supplement this brief and\nproduce that evidence.” (Emphasis added.) Similarly, in his August 13, 2013,\nsupplemental brief, plaintiff asked that “if the certification of the class turns on evidence\nthat may be provided by LASC, the court allow the certification hearing to be continued\nto such time as plaintiff is able to obtain such evidence.” (Emphasis added.) Plaintiff\nnever indicated his belief that further discovery was necessary; rather, he requested that\nthe court continue the class certification hearing only if the court determined further\nevidence was needed.\n       At the class certification hearing, plaintiff again failed to make any request for a\ncontinuance of the hearing or the court’s ruling. By this time, plaintiff had received the\ncourt’s lengthy and detailed tentative ruling and was aware of its reasoning and findings\nthat plaintiff had failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that class certification was\nwarranted. Despite this fact, plaintiff did not request that the court delay its ruling until\nfurther discovery on LACSC’s policies could be completed. Rather, after reiterating his\nattempts to obtain discovery from LACSC, Bochner simply stated: “We’ve tried every\n\n\n                                              39\n\fwhich way to get [LACSC] to cooperate, and they’re not cooperating. So regardless of\nwhether this motion is granted or not granted, there is going to be a motion to compel\nthem to appear . . . at deposition [sic] and to explain themselves.” Accordingly, plaintiff\nwaived any objection to the trial court’s failure to defer ruling on plaintiff’s class\ncertification motion. (Lewinter, supra, 26 Cal.App.4th at p. 1224.)\n       Even liberally construing the record to find that plaintiff requested a continuance\nto permit additional discovery, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\nimplicitly denying this request. (Combs v. Skyriver Communications, Inc. (2008) 159\nCal.App.4th 1242, 1270 [affirming trial court’s implicit denial of a request for\ncontinuance by ruling on the underlying summary judgment motion].)15 As just detailed,\nplaintiff waited until August 13, 2013—16 months after discovery opened, 3 months after\nhis reply brief in support of class certification was filed, and a mere one week before the\nclass certification hearing—to make, at best, an equivocal request for a continuance of\nthe certification hearing. In these circumstances, the trial court did not err in implicitly\ndenying plaintiff’s continuance request.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The order denying class certification is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       15\n          In its order denying class certification, the trial court referenced Bochner’s\nstatements that he had been attempting to depose LACSC. In discussing whether the\nfalsity of the statements could be determined by common proof, the court stated: “With\nrespect to the statement that GCS might employ alternate means of collection . . . plaintiff\nsuggests in supplemental papers filed on August 13, 2013, that he has attempted, but has\nbeen unsuccessful to date, in getting testimony from the LACSC on this issue. It is\nunnecessary to resolve this issue because, even if plaintiff had evidence that LACSC had\na policy against employing these alternate means of collection, plaintiff has failed to\nshow that the other elements of the misrepresentation claims may be established by\ncommon facts and/or evidence.” Nowhere, however, did the trial court expressly\nconstrue Bochner’s statements as a request for a continuance.\n\n\n                                              40\n\f                                        _________________________\n                                        Miller, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nKline, P.J.\n\n\n_________________________\nStewart, J.\n\n\n\n\nA140351, Howard v.

Plaintiff appeals from the\ntrial court’s order denying his motion to certify a class of all California residents who had\nreceived letters from the defendant containing similar representations. The trial court\nruled that plaintiff failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that common issues\npredominated, that his claims were typical of the class, and that his attorney was adequate\nto serve as class counsel. We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nA.     Defendant’s Role in Los Angeles’ Traffic Enforcement Camera System\n       In 2007 and 2008, the County of Los Angeles contracted with a third-party vendor\nto operate automated traffic enforcement cameras. These cameras photographed vehicles\ncommitting red-light violations. The third-party vendor obtained information regarding\nthe vehicle that ran the red light and its registered owner from the California Department\nof Motor Vehicles (DMV). The responsible law enforcement agency used this\ninformation to send out a notice of traffic violation and notice to appear to the registered\nowner’s address. If the court date listed in the notice to appear passed without the driver\nappearing in court or paying or contesting the traffic fine, the law enforcement agency\nwould label the account as delinquent with Los Angeles County Superior Court\n(LACSC). LACSC then assessed a $250 delinquency fee to the account, sent the driver a\nnotice of delinquency letter, and referred the account to collections.\n       Defendant is the County of Los Angeles’ collection agency. In 2006, it contracted\nwith the county to “develop a comprehensive court/county collection program to improve\nenforcement of court collections.” Under this contract, the County would refer certain\naccounts—including “[t]raffic citations where a [driver] fails to appear before being\nsentenced”—to defendant for collection. Upon receiving information from the County,\ndefendant was required to send “Delinquency Letters” to debtors upon receiving the\ninformation from the County. The contract required that the letter identify the defendant,\n“[i]nform the debtor of the origin of the debt and the current amount owed;” “[a]dvise of\nthe consequences of continued non-compliance, such as wage garnishment, and property\nseizures”; and “[e]xplain that a debtor with an Infraction/Misdemeanor with\nUnadjudicated Bail . . . who wishes to dispute the debt must schedule a court\nappearance.”\nB.     Plaintiff’s Allegations\n       Plaintiff filed this action on July 7, 2011. The fourth amended class action\ncomplaint, the operative complaint for our purposes, was filed on September 17, 2012.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       On July 12, 2010, plaintiff received a single page letter from defendant that is the\nfocus of this lawsuit. This letter, attached to the fourth amended complaint as Exhibit A,\nhas the words “balance due statement” in bold, capitalized print near the top of the page,\nand purports to be from GC Services Limited Partnership Collection Agency Division.\nThe letter asserts that plaintiff owes LACSC $680.00 and that this amount “may include\nmultiple citations.” It advises plaintiff that his “failure to respond to previous\nnotifications may result in the Los Angeles Superior Court obtaining a civil money\njudgment against you” and that the “State of California’s Department of Motor Vehicles\nis assisting us in locating you.” The letter then states: “You should take this opportunity\nto contact us immediately . . . . By contacting us at this time to resolve your unpaid bail,\nyou will avoid further methods of collection which may include pursuing a civil money\njudgment” which would result in “garnishing your wages or other sources of income”;\n“attaching your bank account”; “filing a lien which will attach to all real property you\nnow own or later acquire in California”; and “all other lawful processes.”\n       Plaintiff alleged that he had never received any prior notification about any\ncitation. He called defendant at the phone number listed in the letter, and a representative\ninformed plaintiff that he had been “cited for running a red light which was captured by\ncamera in Southern California” and the camera had “identified the vehicle and its license\nplate number.” Plaintiff, a resident of Concord, California, told the representative that he\nhad not been in Southern California since 1999, had never received a traffic citation\nthere, and did not own (and never had owned) a car matching the description of the car\nwhich allegedly ran the red light.\n       Plaintiff next contacted the DMV and inquired about the citation. He told the\nDMV representative that he had never received a citation, a notice to appear in court, or\nany judgment from a court. He further stated that his ability to register his vehicle had\nnot been made contingent on the payment of any citation and no “points” had been placed\non his driving record. Plaintiff alleges that the “DMV could not resolve the issue.”\n       On July 20, 2010, plaintiff, through his attorney, sent defendant a certified letter.\nPlaintiff’s letter (which was not on attorney letterhead and appeared to be signed by him)\n\n\n                                              3\n\fstated that he had been the victim of identity theft around the time of the alleged red light\nviolation and that “various vehicles were purchased with [his] identifying information.”\nPlaintiff stated he had since been “vindicated by litigation.” He wrote that he had never\nowned the car that allegedly ran the red light, had never received a traffic citation in\nSouthern California, and had not been in Southern California since 1999. Plaintiff never\nreceived a response to his letter. According to defendant, however, it closed plaintiff’s\naccount and stopped attempting to collect it as a result of plaintiff’s letter.\n        Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Complaint alleges five causes of action: (1)\nnegligence; (2) negligent misrepresentation; (3) fraud; (4) declaratory relief; and (5)\nunfair business practices under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL). Each cause of action\ngenerally alleged that the representations in defendant’s letter—namely that the DMV\nwas assisting defendant in locating individuals and that there would be various\nconsequences if the recipient did not respond—were false based on LACSC’s policies,\nand that defendant knew, or should have known, of the falsity of the representations.\nPlaintiff alleged that where a citation was based on a red-light camera, LACSC “does not\ndeem itself as having jurisdiction and does not allow default judgments, liens,\ngarnishment, levies or other such activity, nor does it report such citations to the DMV\neither. It appears such may be true in all such cases.”\n        Plaintiff alleged he suffered damage because he was “compelled to contact\nDefendants, the DMV and an attorney about these matter [sic] and had to pay an attorney\nfor assistance in drafting a letter regarding these baseless accusations. Additionally, he\nhas incurred emotional distress in dealing with this matter.” Others in the putative class,\nhe alleged, suffered damage by actually paying the citations. In his declaratory relief\ncause of action, plaintiff sought a declaration that defendant must refrain from making\nthese representations and a “declaration of rights and duties regarding whether\nDefendants were debt collecting under the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collections Practices\nAct.”\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fC.     Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification\n       Plaintiff filed a motion to certify the class on September 28, 2012.1 Plaintiff\nsought to certify a class of every “California resident who, on or after July 1, 2007, was\nthe subject of a letter from Defendants regarding a red light camera citation and which\nrepresented (a) the Department of Motor Vehicles was assisting defendants in locating\nthem (b) that a balance was due or an amount was owing on such citation and/or (c) that\nfailure to respond to the letter might result in wage garnishment, bank levies, liens or\nother collection activity set forth in the letter.”\n       Plaintiff argued that defendant had admitted in discovery that thousands of\nindividuals had received letters that contained substantially similar representations to the\nletter received by plaintiff. He argued, therefore, that each class member had been\n“subjected to a common course of conduct. The proof of each will be simply based on\nthe terms of those letters and whether they violated law under any of the theories\nalleged.” In support of his certification motion, plaintiff submitted the letter he received\nfrom defendant, the letter he sent defendant in response, and a copy of the Notice of\nTraffic Violation related to the underlying red-light citation. Plaintiff’s counsel, Ron\nBochner, provided a declaration asserting that he was “experienced in complex litigation”\nand had been “named class counsel in eight cases, all of which settled or are in the\nprocess of settling . . . and two other cases which are pending but have not been certified\nto date.”\n       On May 7, 2013, defendant filed its opposition to the class certification motion.2\nDefendant argued that common questions of law or fact did not exist because plaintiff’s\n\n\n       1\n         The trial court set the September 28, 2012, deadline for filing the class\ncertification motion at the April 26, 2012, case management conference.\n       2\n         For reasons that are not entirely clear in the record, defendant’s opposition was\nfiled eight months after plaintiff’s motion. It appears that on September 14, 2012, the\nparties filed a “Stipulation and Order Extending Time for MTN to Compel.” The text of\nthis stipulation is not in the record. In plaintiff’s motion for class certification, plaintiff\nstated that because a “discovery issue remains pending, and for other reasons, the parties\nstipulated [to extend] the time to bring a Motion to Compel further responses and to\n\n                                                5\n\ftheories relied on the adjudication of individual issues such as (1) whether the class\nmember paid the requested balance; (2) whether the class member ran the red light; or (3)\nwhether the individual paid the outstanding balance as a result of defendant’s letter.\nDefendant contended that these individualized determinations meant that its liability, if\nany, could not be determined on a class-wide basis. Defendant also argued that plaintiff’s\nclaims were atypical of those of the purported class because plaintiff had received the\nletter as a result of alleged identity theft, knew he had not run a red light, and did not pay\nthe requested balance. This was, therefore, another reason to deny class certification.\n       Defendant also contended that Bochner was inadequate to serve as class counsel.\nDefendant relied on a finding by a different court in a different case that Bochner had\nengaged in unethical conduct. In Lee v. American Agencies (Alameda County Super. Ct.\nCase No. RG09477598), the superior court granted American Agencies’ motion for\nsummary judgment on debt collection claims raised by a plaintiff represented by\nBochner. Subsequently, the court awarded American Agencies its attorneys’ fees. The\ncourt found that American Agencies had “shown that many of Plaintiffs’ allegations and\npositions taken in this lawsuit were baseless (or put another way, were not ‘minimally\ncolorable’).” The court further found that when American Agencies had attempted to\nsubpoena certain records, “Plaintiff refused to consent, forcing Defendants to file a\nmotion to obtain credit reporting records, which confirmed that no Defendant had\nreported the disputed item to any credit agency. Plaintiff’s refusal strongly suggests an\nintent to obstruct, rather than resolve, this litigation. Both this claim and Plaintiff’s\ntactics in litigating the claim were completely meritless.” Ultimately, the court stated that\nthe “circumstances in which this case arose are not entirely above suspicion; the manner\nin which Plaintiff’s counsel prosecuted the case is not admirable; and the Court cannot\n\nextend the time for filing class certification briefing and hearing of the class certification\nmotion.” The Register of Actions does not reveal when the order approving this\nstipulation was filed. However, the class certification hearing was repeatedly moved\n(either as the result of a stipulation or motion by defendant), first from November 30,\n2012, to April 16, 2013, then to June 11, 2013, then to July 11, 2013, and finally to\nAugust 20, 2013.\n\n\n                                               6\n\ffind even a minimally colorable claim or position taken by Plaintiff.” The court then\nstated the “evidence overwhelmingly points to the bad faith of [plaintiff’s] attorney.”\n       In opposing the request for attorneys’ fees, Bochner had included an argument that\nany attorneys’ fee award could not be assessed against him. This argument appears to\nhave led the superior court to question whether Bochner had violated the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct. The court concluded its order granting attorneys’ fees by writing:\n“In light of the Court’s above findings regarding counsel’s conduct of this lawsuit, the\nCourt intends to REPORT Attorney Bochner to the California State Bar for violation of\nBusiness & Professions Code section 6068(c). As noted above, the evidence strongly\nsuggests that the tactics and claims giving rise to the fee award are primarily, if not\nsolely, lawyer-driven. Plaintiff has not supplied any declaration in support of her\nopposition and, indeed, there is no evidence that she is even aware of this Motion.\nPerhaps most importantly, at some point during these proceedings, Plaintiff’s and her\nattorney’s interests clearly diverged. Thus, counsel may also have violated one or more\nfiduciary and/or ethical duties to his client in the course of litigating the instant motion.”3\n       In support of its opposition to class certification, defendant submitted the\ndeclaration of Scott Cole, defendant’s managing vice president. Cole described how\nwhen a red-light camera violation was not contested or paid, the “Superior Court’s\nInformation Technology department caused electronic information about such accounts\nto be sent to GCS’s proprietary automated collection system.” The information\ndefendant received from LACSC would vary from fine to fine, but generally included\n“the name of the registered owner of the vehicle involved in the violation . . . , the\nowner’s driver’s license number . . . , the owner’s date of birth, the owner’s address, the\namount placed for collection, the balance due, the date of the violation . . . , and the\n\n       3\n         As we discuss below, by the time of the hearing on the class certification motion\nin this action, Bochner had appealed the award of attorneys’ fees and the order was\nreversed on the ground that plaintiff had asserted at least one colorable claim. (Lee v.\nAmerican Agencies (A133016, A133752, July 2, 2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3353895</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [nonpub.\nopn.].) Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal referenced Bochner’s “dubious litigation\ntactics.” (Id. at p. *10.)\n\n\n                                               7\n\flicense plate number of the vehicle involved.” Defendant would not be provided with\ncopies of the documents underlying the traffic violation, such as the notice of violation or\nnotice to appear. Cole stated that during the putative class period, 22,587 California\nresidents received letters “that were in the form of the balance due statement letter sent to\nplaintiff that sought to collect fines assessed for red-light violations detected by red-light\ncameras in Los Angeles County.” In addition to such letters, Cole stated that defendant\nemployed other collection efforts, such as phone calls and different letters.\n       On May 28, 2013, plaintiff filed his reply brief in support of class certification.\nPlaintiff argued that the individual issues identified by defendant did not defeat class\ncertification. His position was that defendant’s letter was unlawful because of “Los\nAngeles Superior Court’s refusal to take default judgments in cases where, as here,\ncitizens are cited purely through the use of a technology recording a license plate, not\nupon direct citation of the driver at the time and place where the incident occurred. That\nGC failed to know of or take heed of the presumption of innocence as well as Los\nAngeles Superior Court’s policy and practice is the precise point of this case. GC had a\nduty to assure its representations were true. It did not. If some of the drivers may\nactually have run a red light, there was not and could not be a determination of the fact at\nthe time the letter was sent. . . . The letter represents GC’s uniform policy and practice\nand illegal effect.” For similar reasons, plaintiff argued he was typical of the unnamed\nclass members because he, “like all the class members, received a demand that the full\nsum of money was due and owing and needed to be paid and that certain collection\nefforts could take place if he did not respond to the letter. None of this was proper when\nthe citation was by camera match to the vehicle owner . . . as is again shown by the policy\nof [LACSC] not to take default judgments on such citations.” Responding to defendant’s\nargument that Bochner was an inadequate class counsel, plaintiff asserted that the\nallegations of unprofessional conduct in the American Agencies case had “nothing to do\nwith the elements of class certification or an abuse of the class certification procedure and\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fhas no application in this case. Indeed, in this case plaintiff has undertaken this entire\nmatter in more than good faith.”4\n       Along with his reply brief, plaintiff submitted documents pertaining to LACSC’s\npolicies regarding the handling of red-light citations when a defendant fails to appear.\nPlaintiff submitted two charts from LACSC’s “Clerical Authority” standing orders and\nguidelines. Plaintiff obtained these documents from LACSC pursuant to a subpoena for\nbusiness records. These documents state that, “[p]ursuant to a County Counsel legal\nopinion, no failure to appear violation can be entered” on red light camera citations, and\nthe failure to appear is not reported to the DMV. Instead, a $250 civil assessment is\nadded and LACSC’s system will “automatically refer case to GC Services for\ncollections.”\n       On August 13, 2013—one week before the class certification hearing—Bochner\nfiled a “Supplemental Brief and Declaration of Ron Bochner in Support Thereof on Class\nCertification Motion.” This declaration attached what Bochner described as “various\nmedia reports true and correct copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit A.” Exhibit\nA consists of unlabeled notes that purport to recount a statement by Mary Hearn, the\nDirector of Public Information for LACSC, and three internet news stories (from the Los\nAngeles Times website and “dailynews.com”) from July 2011, September 2011, and\nMarch 2012. Bochner’s declaration did not characterize these documents or otherwise\nmake argument from them. These documents, however, generally purport to paraphrase\nor quote Los Angeles County and LACSC staff for the proposition that LACSC’s policy\nwas not to pursue red-light camera citations where the recipient ignored the citation.\n       In both his reply and supplemental declarations, Bochner recounted his attempt to\nget LACSC personnel to appear at a deposition to “confirm” the statements made in the\nnews stories. In his reply declaration, Bochner asserted that LACSC had “refused to\nappear for deposition and confirm the various newspaper stories.” He stated that if the\n\n       4\n         In a supporting declaration, Bochner attached an eight-page letter he had sent to\nthe California State Bar in response to the American Agencies court’s referral to the state\nbar for unprofessional conduct.\n\n\n                                              9\n\f“court desires further evidence on Los Angeles Superior Court’s practices and policies,\nplaintiff asks leave to supplement this brief and produce that evidence once the\ndeposition has been completed.” In his August 13, 2013, supplemental brief and\ndeclaration, Bochner further detailed his unsuccessful attempts to have an LACSC\nofficial attend a deposition. Bochner asked that “if the certification of the class turns on\nevidence that may be provided by [LACSC], the court allow the certification hearing to\nbe continued to such time as plaintiff is able to obtain such evidence.”\nD.     The Trial Court’s Ruling\n       The hearing on the class certification motion was held on August 20, 2013. In\nadvance of the hearing, the trial court issued a detailed tentative ruling. Following a\nlengthy hearing, the trial court confirmed its tentative ruling and issued a 12-page order\ndenying plaintiff’s motion for class certification.\n       The court found that plaintiff had identified an ascertainable and sufficiently\nnumerous class. It stated that plaintiff’s proposed class definition “includes sufficient\ncommon characteristics to identify members of the class. The court also finds the\nproposed class is sufficiently numerous either at approximately 2,000 as asserted by GCS\nin its discovery response or at over 22,000 as asserted in the Declaration of Scott Cole\nfiled in opposition to plaintiff’s motion for class certification.”\n       The court, however, found that plaintiff had failed to produce sufficient evidence\nthat defendant’s liability could be established by common proof such that common issues\npredominated over individual issues. As to the negligence cause of action, the court\nnoted that “the issue of [defendant’s] liability and whether there is a causal link between\nany breach and damages suffered by the putative class members depends on the\ndetermination of individual issues. . . . The only evidence of liability and causation\noffered in support of plaintiff’s motion for class certification is unique to plaintiff’s\ncircumstances.” As to plaintiff’s attempt to establish defendant’s liability based on proof\nof LACSC’s policies, the court found this did not meet plaintiff’s burden because the\n“theory is not supported by the evidence submitted in support of plaintiff’s motion for\nclass certification.”\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       As to the misrepresentation-based causes of action, the court found that the falsity\nof many of the representations contained in defendant’s letter could not be determined by\ncommon proof. For example, the court stated: “Plaintiff has failed to cite sufficient\nevidence that the falsity of these statements is subject to common proof. Plaintiff cites\nevidence of the falsity of the balance due statement only as it applies to plaintiff. In\ncontrast, whether other class members owed money to LACSC may be true if the person\nreceiving the letter was the driver pictured in the citation and he had failed to appear\nand/or timely pay the citation.” Additionally, the court found that plaintiff had failed to\nshow that the materiality of the representations, and class members’ reliance on those\nrepresentations, was subject to common proof. It stated that a “class member who took\nany steps to dispute the asserted fine, paid a fine that was not actually owed or suffered\nany other damages, may have done so for any number of reasons. He may have relied on\nthe red light letter from GCS but he may have also relied on GCS’s other collection\nefforts or taken action in response to prior correspondence from LACSC.” As to\nplaintiff’s declaratory relief cause of action, however, the court found that common issues\npredominated, but only to the extent plaintiff sought a judicial determination that\ndefendant was engaged in debt collection—a claim included in the fourth amended\ncomplaint simply in anticipation of a defense defendant may have sought to raise.\n       The court next found that plaintiff’s claims were not typical of the class as to the\nnegligence or misrepresentation causes of action because plaintiff “was neither the driver\nnor the registered owner of the car subject to the red light camera citation” and he “never\nreceived the initial citation from the issuing agency or the notice of violation from the\nsuperior court.” Instead, plaintiff “was the victim of identity theft and there [was] no\nevidence other putative class members have suffered similar issues.”\n       The trial court also found that plaintiff had failed to meet his burden of\ndemonstrating that Bochner was qualified to serve as counsel for the class. It found\nBochner’s declaration in support of class certification had failed to provide any\ninformation regarding the size or nature of the class actions for which Bochner had\nserved as class counsel. The court also stated that “Mr. Bochner goes on to say that he\n\n\n                                             11\n\fhas settled all cases in which he was named class counsel and, thus, i[t] can be inferred\nthat he has no experience in bringing such cases to trial. It also appears from plaintiff’s\npleadings that Mr. Bochner is a sole practitioner and . . . likely has insufficient resources\nto adequately serve the interests of a large class of individuals.” The court then found\nthat “[e]ven if plaintiff had met his burden, the court is concerned with counsel’s\ncompetence to represent the proposed class” in light of the superior court’s finding in the\nAmerican Agencies case. The court stated that this finding “casts serious doubt as to Mr.\nBochner’s qualifications and ability to competently represent the class here.”\n       Finally, the trial court found that certifying plaintiff’s proposed class would not\nprovide the litigants and the court a substantial benefit. It stated that a “class action is not\nthe superior method of obtaining relief where proposed class counsel is not qualified and\nonly a declaratory relief allegation, which may not provide complete relief to the class,\nappears to qualify for class treatment.”\n                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       We review the order denying class certification for an abuse of discretion.

Predominance of Common Questions\n       Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in concluding that he had failed to\nestablish the predominance of common questions with respect to his claims.\n              1.     Predominance in General\n       “Plaintiffs’ burden on moving for class certification . . . is not merely to show that\nsome common issues exist, but, rather, to place substantial evidence in the record that\ncommon issues predominate.” (Lockheed Martin Corp. v.

In addition to finding predominance, the\ntrial court “must also conclude that litigation of individual issues . . . can be managed\nfairly and efficiently.” (Duran at pp. 28-29.)\n       “Predominance is a factual question; accordingly, the trial court’s finding that\ncommon issues predominate generally is reviewed for substantial evidence. [Citation.]\nWe must ‘[p]resume[e] in favor of the certification order . . . the existence of every fact\nthe trial court could reasonably deduce from the record. . . .’ ” (Brinker, supra, 53\nCal.4th at 1022, quoting Sav-on, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 329.)\n              2.     Negligence\n       The trial court concluded that plaintiff had failed to meet his burden to\ndemonstrate that defendant’s liability and the causal link between any breach by\ndefendant and any damage suffered by the plaintiff could be established by common facts\nor evidence. ~(AA 205)~ Plaintiff argues that the court erroneously focused on the\nindividual facts of each class member. Plaintiff asserts that defendant was negligent\n\n\n                                             14\n\fregardless of each class member’s individual circumstances “because [defendant’s] letter\nasserts, against the policy of the [LACSC] and what had actually been determined at the\ntime the letter was sent, that those who had been cited were guilty (determined to owe\nmoney) and induced its recipients to pay by the undue demands and threats which were\nmade, thus causing harm.” He thus asserts that the “class had a right to be free from\nletters which were based on [defendant’s] failure to know and take heed of [LACSC’s]\npolicy and the actual legal status that policy indicates.”\n       The flaw in plaintiff’s argument is that whether LACSC’s red-light citation\npolicies constitute common proof as to defendant’s liability necessarily depends on the\nexistence of a uniform policy with which defendant’s letters did not comply. The trial\ncourt determined that plaintiff had failed to support his theory regarding LACSC’s policy\n(and, by extension, defendant’s liability). The court’s finding is supported by the record,\nor more accurately, by the lack of substantial evidence from plaintiff. The sum total of\nplaintiff’s evidence on this critical point is: (1) statements by Bochner in his declaration\nin support of class certification as to what LACSC’s policies are (statements which\nmirror allegations in the complaint); (2) two small charts from LACSC labeled “Clerical\nAuthority,” which suggest that when a defendant fails to appear in a “photo enforcement”\ncase, a failure to appear violation will not issue, and the DMV is not informed, but a $250\ndelinquency fee is assessed and the account is referred to collections; and (3) three news\nstories and unattributed notes of what a LACSC official stated regarding the court’s\npolicies.\n       As to the news stories and unattributed notes, it is not clear whether the trial court\nreceived these documents in evidence. As we have noted, Bochner attached these\ndocuments as exhibits to his supplemental brief and declaration in support of class\ncertification. At the class certification hearing, defendant objected to the admission of\nthese documents, remarking that defendant had “repeatedly objected” to these “press\nreleases and . . . what has been submitted” by Bochner. Defense counsel noted that the\ncourt “has previously instructed Mr. Bochner not to make arguments concerning that, and\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fyet we’re back here again arguing about that.” The trial court did not rule on this\nobjection at the hearing.\n       If the trial court did not admit these documents (i.e., the news stories and\nunattributed notes), then plaintiff’s remaining evidence on this point (the “Clerical\nAuthority” charts) did not support plaintiff’s theory. The “Clerical Authority” charts do\nnot address plaintiff’s contention that LACSC does not issue default judgments in these\ncases or that various collection methods are not permitted. Assuming, however, the trial\ncourt admitted the news stories and unattributed notes, the trial court’s order implicitly\nfound that they, too, failed to support plaintiff’s theory that defendant’s liability could be\nbased on LACSC’s policies. (See Lockheed, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 1108 [stating that\nplaintiff’s burden is to place “substantial evidence” in the record that common issues\npredominate].)5 This implicit determination was not an abuse of discretion.\n       The trial court also found that whether defendant breached its duty or caused\ndamage to class members would require individual inquiries. To determine whether a\ndefendant owes a duty to a plaintiff for purposes of a negligence cause of action, a court\nis required to balance various factors which include “ ‘the foreseeability of harm to\n[plaintiff], the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, [and] the closeness of\nthe connection between the defendant’s conduct and the injury suffered.’ ” (Dept. of Fish\n\n       5\n           In concluding that plaintiff’s theory was unsupported, the trial court carefully\nanalyzed the evidence in support of plaintiff’s allegations that it was “LACSC’s policy\n. . . not [to] allow default judgments, liens, garnishment or levies with respect to red light\ncamera violations and it does not report the citations to the DMV,” and concluded that it\nwas unsupported. “This theory is not supported by the evidence submitted in support of\nplaintiff’s motion for class certification. Plaintiff relies primarily on evidence of two\ncourt procedures regarding the processing of red light camera citations. The first\nprovides that, when a party receiving a red light camera citation fails to appear, the court\nclerk will add a $250 delinquency fee, send a Notice of Delinquency Letter and then refer\nthe case to GCS for collections. The second provides that instead of notifying the DMV\nof the red light camera citee’s failure to appear, a $250 civil assessment is imposed and\nthe citation is referred to collections.

Foreseeability of harm is the key factor in this\nanalysis. (Dept. of Fish & Game v. Superior Court, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1357.)\nWhether defendant could reasonably foresee that its collection letter would cause damage\nto the class would turn on (1) whether the class member was, in fact, the driver of the car\nthat was photographed running a red light and (2) what the defendant knew, or should\nhave known, of those circumstances, and (3) what court proceedings had taken place on\nthe citation. Plaintiff has not demonstrated how these issues could be determined through\ncommon proof.\n       Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in rejecting his request to employ a class\n“notice” in which each class member would state whether she had received defendant’s\nletter and read it. He contends this would have eliminated the need for individualized\ninquiries. The trial court found such a “notice” would serve as a mere “discovery\nquestionnaire.” The trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting such a device.\nWhile the proposed notice might help narrow the class, plaintiff has not demonstrated\nhow this notice would obviate the need for individual inquiries to establish defendant’s\nliability as to each class member.\n       For the first time on appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court should have\nconsidered certifying an “issues only” or “liability only” class. This argument is waived\nbecause plaintiff did not raise either alternative before the trial court. (Newton v.\nClemons (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2273487\"><a href=\"/opinion/2273487/newton-v-clemons/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Conceding that he did not raise the argument\nbelow, plaintiff argues we should consider it anyway because it is a question of law and\ndefendant would suffer no prejudice. We decline to do so. Trial courts are “ideally\nsituated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action” (Linder,\nsupra, 23 Cal.4th at p. 435), and we will not make that determination in the first instance.\n       In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that plaintiff\nfailed to establish that common issues predominated over individual issues as to his\nnegligence claim.\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f              3.      Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation\n       The trial court denied class certification as to plaintiff’s misrepresentation-based\ncauses of action on the ground that plaintiff had not shown that either the falsity of many\nof defendants’ representations or the class members’ reliance on those representations\nwere subject to common proof.\n       To prevail on a fraud claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) a misrepresentation;\n(2) knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to defraud; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting\ndamage. (Belasco v. Wells (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Accordingly, under both causes of action, plaintiffs must\nplead actual reliance on the alleged misrepresentation. (Ibid.)\n       We begin by addressing the trial court’s reliance finding. Plaintiff argues that the\nputative class members’ reliance should be presumed because the entire class was\nexposed to uniform misrepresentations contained in defendant’s letter. Plaintiff is correct\nthat in certain cases, reliance can be presumed on behalf of a class. For example, in\nVasquez v. Superior Court (1971) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1185687\"><a href=\"/opinion/1185687/vasquez-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Vasquez), the Supreme Court addressed\na fraud action where the defendant’s salespeople “memorized a standard statement\ncontaining the representations (which in turn were based on a printed narrative and sales\nmanual) and that this statement was recited by rote to every member of the class.” (Id. at\npp. 811-812.) In these circumstances, the court stated if “the trial court finds material\nmisrepresentations were made to the class members, at least an inference of reliance\nwould arise as to the entire class.” (Id. at p. 814; see also Mirkin v.

If the representations were in fact made in writing to each member of the\nclass, and plaintiffs thereupon entered into the contracts of purchase as alleged, then a\npersuasive inference of reliance upon the representations arises without the necessity of\ntestimony on that issue from each individual member of the class.” (Id. at p. 338.)\n       In contrast to these cases, courts have recognized that where “the issue of . . .\nreliance . . . is a matter that would vary from consumer to consumer, the issue is not\nsubject to common proof, and the action is properly not certified as a class action.”\n(Tucker v. Pacific Bell Mobile Services (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222 (Tucker).)\nThus, in Tucker, plaintiff sought to represent a class of consumers alleging that a cellular\nphone service provider failed to disclose its practice of “rounding up” its customers\npartially used airtime minutes, reducing the number of minutes the customer could use.\nThe court found that reliance could not be established on a class-wide basis because “the\npurported misrepresentations were communicated to class members through a variety of\nwritten materials, through the mail, via the Internet, by telephone and in retail stores.”\n(Tucker, supra, 208 Cal.App.4th at p. 224.)6 The court noted that it was not even clear if\nthe members of the class had seen or relied on any of the alleged misrepresentations. (Id.\nat p. 221; see also Davis-Miller v. Automobile Club of Southern California (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Similarly, in Sotelo v.\n\n       6\n         Plaintiff argues that Tucker “did not speak as to the standard on class\ncertification at all, as it was not based on a class certification motion.” While plaintiff is\ncorrect that Tucker did not involve a class certification motion, its holding most certainly\ndid speak to the class certification standard. Tucker involved an appeal after a trial court\nhad sustained a demurrer on plaintiff’s class allegations. A trial court can only sustain a\ndemurrer on class allegations where it “concludes as a matter of law that, assuming the\ntruth of the factual allegations in the complaint, there is no reasonable possibility that the\nrequirements for class certification will be satisfied.” (Bridgeford v. Pacific Health Corp.\n(2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1034</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1041-1042.) Accordingly, the analysis in Tucker involved\nan application of the class certification standard, albeit in a distinct procedural posture.\n\n\n                                             19\n\fMediaNews Group, Inc.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Sotelo), we found that a class\nmember’s reliance on representations in a contract could not be presumed; “although\neach putative class member . . . signed [the contract], reliance may not be presumed\nunless there is a showing that putative class members actually read their contracts.” (Id.\nat p. 656.)\n       In this case, the trial court found that reliance could not be inferred because “[a]\nClass member who took any steps to dispute the asserted fine, paid a fine that was not\nactually owed or suffered any other damages, may have done so for any number of\nreasons. He may have relied on the red light letter from [defendant] but he may have also\nrelied on [defendant’s] other collection efforts or taken action in response to prior\ncorrespondence from LACSC.” It thus concluded that “whether class members relied on\nthe alleged misrepresentations in the red light letter requires consideration of\nindividualized proof and is not a proper subject for determination on a class-wide basis.”\n       Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding. Although plaintiff has\npresented evidence that each putative class member received substantially similar letters\nfrom defendant, the record also suggests that putative class members received other\ncommunications that made direct demands for payment. For example, plaintiff submitted\na copy of his “Notice of Traffic Violation” from the Culver City Police Department\nasserting that plaintiff had to “pay or deposit” $381 to LACSC for the charged violation.\nThe Cole declaration reveals that defendant engages in collection efforts separate from\nthe challenged letter, such as the use of different letters and collection phone calls. As\nCole stated in his declaration, while defendant can determine whether an individual paid\nin full or in part, it cannot determine which communication caused the class member to\npay. Any of these communications could have been the motivating force behind a class\nmember’s decision to pay the asserted balance. Because the record shows that many\nclass members received a variety of targeted communications regarding their obligation\nto pay LACSC, we conclude that this is not a case where reliance can be presumed\nsimply because each class member received the challenged letter. Rather, the variety of\ncommunications the class members received makes this a case where the issue of reliance\n\n\n                                             20\n\f“is a matter that would vary from consumer to consumer” and thus is not subject to\ncommon proof (Tucker, supra, 208 Cal.App.4th at p. 222), and the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in so finding.\n       The record also supports the trial court’s finding that plaintiff had failed to show\nthat the falsity of many of defendant’s representations was subject to common proof.\nDefendant’s representation that plaintiff had a balance owing to LACSC was false\nbecause of plaintiff’s unique circumstances as an alleged victim of identity theft. As the\ntrial court recognized, however, “whether other class members owed money to LACSC\nmay be true if the person receiving the letter was the driver pictured in the citation and he\nhad failed to appear and/or timely pay the citation.” The court also concluded that\nplaintiff had failed to demonstrate that the alleged false representation that the DMV was\nhelping to locate class members was subject to common proof. For the reasons discussed\nabove in the context of plaintiff’s negligence cause of action, these findings are supported\nby plaintiff’s failure to present substantial evidence regarding LACSC’s policies.\nWithout evidence suggesting a common LACSC policy that rendered defendant’s\nrepresentations false or misleading as to the entire class, the question of falsity would\nnecessarily turn on each individual’s case.7\n       Substantial evidence thus supports the trial court’s conclusion that reliance and\nfalsity are not subject to common proof. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying plaintiff’s motion to certify plaintiff’s fraud and negligent\nmisrepresentation causes of action.\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         Plaintiff contends that the trial court ignored authority that a “technically true\nstatement can be deceptive if it is couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or\ndeceive,” citing two cases, Day v. AT&T (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Although a technically true\nstatement can be misleading, this does not aid plaintiff because he failed to introduce\nsufficient evidence that the representations were made in a manner that was likely to\nmislead or deceive each class member, for the reasons discussed above.\n\n\n                                               21\n\f              4.     UCL\n       Like plaintiff’s fraud and misrepresentation claim, the trial court denied\ncertification of plaintiff’s UCL cause of action on the grounds that plaintiff had failed to\nintroduce sufficient evidence that the falsity of defendant’s representations and the class\nmembers’ reliance on those representations were subject to common proof. On appeal,\nplaintiff contends that the trial court erred in its analysis because the UCL does not\nrequire a class plaintiff to present individualized evidence regarding class members’\nreliance.\n       A UCL action is equitable in nature and has limited remedies; prevailing plaintiffs\nare limited to injunctive relief and restitution. (In re Tobacco II Cases (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801796\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801796/in-re-tobacco-ii-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 312 (Tobacco II).) The fraud-prong of the UCL has been understood as distinct\nfrom common law fraud. “ ‘A [common law] fraudulent deception must be actually\nfalse, known to be false by the perpetrator and reasonably relied upon by a victim who\nincurs damages. None of these elements are required to state a claim for injunctive relief’\nunder the UCL.” (Ibid, quoting Day v. AT&T Corp., supra, 63 Cal.App.4th at p. 332.)\n“A fraudulent practice under the UCL ‘require[s] only a showing that members of the\npublic are likely to be deceived’ and ‘can be shown even without allegations of actual\ndeception, reasonable reliance and damage.’ ” (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing,\nLP (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Kwikset Corporation v. Superior Court (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320.)\nProposition 64 limits private standing under the UCL to any “ ‘person who has suffered\ninjury in fact and has lost money or property’ as a result of unfair competition.” (Ibid,\nquoting Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17204.) In Tobacco II, the Supreme Court addressed the\nimpact that Proposition 64’s new standing requirement had on UCL class actions.\nTobacco II was a class action brought by smokers against the tobacco companies alleging\nthat the companies’ marketing and advertising violated the UCL. After Proposition 64\n\n\n                                             22\n\fwas enacted, the trial court decertified the class, finding that each absent class member\nwas now required to show that they suffered an injury in fact as a result of the alleged\nunfair competition. (Tobacco II, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 306.) The Supreme Court found\ndecertification was improper. It held that Proposition 64 “was not intended to, and does\nnot, impose [Business and Professions Code] section 17204’s standing requirements on\nabsent class members in a UCL class action where class requirements have otherwise\nbeen found to exist.” (Id. at p. 324.) Thus, “relief under the UCL is available [to absent\nclass members] without individualized proof of deception, reliance and injury” so long as\nthe class representative meets Proposition 64 standing requirements. (Id. at p. 320, see\nalso Medrazo v. Honda of North Hollywood (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 [“When the\nprivate action is brought as a class action, only the named plaintiff is required to meet this\nstanding requirement.”].)\n       Relying on Tobacco II, plaintiff here contends that the trial court erred in\nconcluding that he needed to demonstrate that the class members’ reliance was subject to\ncommon proof for purposes of the UCL cause of action. However, the trial court’s\nfinding on this ground finds support from a line of cases. For example, in Cohen v.\nDIRECTV, Inc. (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2260165\"><a href=\"/opinion/2260165/cohen-v-directv-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cohen), the court stated “Tobacco II held\nthat, for purposes of standing in context of the class certification issue . . . involving the\nUCL, the class members need not be assessed for the element of reliance. Or, in other\nwords, class certification may not be defeated on the ground of lack of standing upon a\nshowing that class members did not rely on false advertising.” (Id. at p. 981.) The court\nthen found Tobacco II “irrelevant” to the question of commonality in the class\ncertification context “because the issue of ‘standing’ simply is not the same thing as the\nissue of ‘commonality.’ ” (Ibid.) The court thus concluded that the trial court correctly\nconsidered that the fact that plaintiff’s UCL claim “would involve factual questions\nassociated with their reliance on DIRECTV’s alleged false representations” in denying\ncertification. (Ibid.) Other decisions, such as Tucker (the decision on which the trial\ncourt here relied), have cited Cohen’s analysis approvingly. (Tucker, supra, 208\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\fCal.App.4th at pp. 227-228; Knapp v. AT&T Wireless Services, Inc.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, to support his argument that proof of class-wide reliance is\nnot necessary in the UCL context. There, the court discussed Cohen’s reasoning and\nstated “We agree that Tobacco II did not dispense with the commonality requirement for\nclass certification. But to the extent the appellate court’s opinion might be understood to\nhold that plaintiffs must show class members’ reliance on the alleged misrepresentations\nunder the UCL, we disagree. As Tobacco II made clear, Proposition 64 did not change\nthe substantive law governing UCL claims, other than the standing requirements for the\nnamed plaintiffs, and ‘before Proposition 64, “California courts have repeatedly held that\nrelief under the UCL is available without individualized proof of deception, reliance and\ninjury.” [Citation.]’ ” (Id. at p. 158, quoting Tobacco II, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 326.)\nOther courts have similarly rejected Cohen’s reasoning. (See Greenwood v. Compucredit\nCorp. (N.D. Cal. 2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4807095</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at p. *5 [“To the extent that the court of\nappeal’s decision in Cohen might be read to require individualized evidence of class\nmembers’ reliance, it is inconsistent with Tobacco II.”].). Other courts have more\ngenerally recognized that the UCL does not require a showing of individualized proof of\nmateriality, reliance, or damage. For example, in, Weinstat v. Dentsply International,\nInc. (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255890\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255890/weinstat-v-dentsply-internat-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Superior Court (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2277039\"><a href=\"/opinion/2277039/pfizer-inc-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

As discussed below, the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in finding that plaintiff’s claims are not typical of the class and that\n\n\n                                              24\n\fthe class did not have adequate legal representation. These two grounds provide\nsufficient, independent grounds for affirming the trial court’s order as to plaintiff’s UCL\nclaims. For the same reason, the trial court’s failure to assess whether plaintiff’s unfair-\nprong UCL claim should be certified does not require reversal.\n              5.      Declaratory Relief\n       Plaintiffs’ fourth cause of action asserted a claim for declaratory relief. This cause\nof action sought two different declarations. First, plaintiff sought a declaration that “it is\nnegligent or either a negligent or intentional misrepresentation for Defendants to suggest\nand seek response in light of actual lack of facts supporting an obligation due and owing\nand to suggest associations with the DMV that it does not have and that it may not do so\nin the future.” Second, plaintiff sought a “declaration of rights and duties regarding\nwhether Defendants were debt collecting under the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection\nPractices Act [RFDCPA].” Plaintiff sought this latter declaration because defendant had\n“raised the issue . . . whether they have certain defenses under the [RFDCPA] and\ntherefore the issue of whether they were debt collecting when they sent the letter in\nquestion herein.” Plaintiff alleged that “[i]f so, it appears Defendants violated certain\nnotice provisions under the [RFDCPA] . . . . If not, they have no such defenses.” Plaintiff\ndid not assert a cause of action under the RFDCPA or seek a declaration that defendant\nhad, in fact, violated RFDCPA provisions.\n       In addressing this claim, the trial court noted defendant’s position that plaintiff had\nfailed to properly seek class certification of this claim and defendant’s request to file a\nsupplemental brief if the court were to consider class certification nonetheless. The court\nfound that further briefing was unnecessary because the “court has ultimately determined\nthat certification of all causes of action is improper under the circumstances of this case.”\nNevertheless, the court addressed the merits of whether plaintiff had shown that common\nissues predominated as to the declaratory relief cause of action. To the extent that\nplaintiff sought a declaration that defendant was negligent or had engaged in\nmisrepresentations, the trial court found that “[a]s with plaintiff’s negligence and\nmisrepresentation claims, common issues do not predominate because resolution of these\n\n\n                                              25\n\fquestions necessarily requires individualized inquiries.” The trial court, however, found\nthat plaintiff had “submitted sufficient evidence to show that common issues predominate\nin determining whether GCS is a ‘debt collector’ as defined by the Act and whether its\nactions—the representations in the red light letter – were consistent with the Act.”\n       Defendant has not filed a cross-appeal regarding the trial court’s finding that\ncommon issues predominate as to whether it is a “debt collector” within the meaning of\nthe RFDCPA, so we do not reach this issue. Plaintiff, on the other hand, has argued that\nthe trial court erred in failing to certify the declaratory judgment cause of action in its\nentirety because predominance need not be shown for a declaratory judgment action.\nWhile plaintiff raised this argument in his reply brief before the trial court, the trial court\nnever addressed it. Plaintiff’s argument, however, is without merit.\n       Plaintiff relies entirely on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) (Rule\n23(b)(2)). Rule 23(b)(2) permits class certification in federal court where “the party\nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,\nso that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting\nthe class as a whole.” (Rule. 23(b)(2).) The United States Supreme Court has held that\nthe “key to the (b)(2) class is ‘the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory\nremedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared\nunlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.’ [Citation.]” (Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v .

Where a Rule 23(b)(2) class is asserted, the predominance and superiority\nrequirements of Rule 23(b)(3) need not be met. (See, e.g., Gates v.

Our\nSupreme Court has expressly interpreted the “common . . . interest” requirement of Code\nof Civil Procedure section 382 as requiring “predominant common questions of law or\nfact.” (Brinker, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 1021.) Additionally, Civil Code section 1781,\nreferenced by the Reyes court, permits class actions only where “questions of law or fact\ncommon to the class are substantially similar and predominate over the questions\naffecting the individual members.” (Civ.

(Id. at p. 691, fn.12.) The court nonetheless\nrecognized that “[i]t is the burden of the proponent of class certification to show, with\nsubstantial evidence, that common questions of law or fact predominate over questions\naffecting individual members.” (Id. at p. 689.) Accordingly, we question whether\nCalifornia law permits a court to ignore the predominance requirement in assessing a\nclass certification motion.\n       However, even assuming plaintiff is correct, plaintiff has not established that his\nclaims satisfy the Rule 23(b)(2) standard for certification.

(Capitol People First, supra, 155\nCal.App.4th at p. 691.) Specifically, plaintiff failed to introduce evidence that\ndefendant’s liability could be established through class wide proof, as opposed to an\nindividualized determination of each class member’s circumstances or what defendant\nknew, or should have known, about those circumstances. Thus, based on the record\nplaintiff established before the trial court, it does not appear that defendant’s conduct is\nsuch that it can be “declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of\nthem.” (Wal-Mart, supra, 131 S.Ct. at p. 2557.)\n       Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that common\nquestions did not predominate to the extent that plaintiff’s declaratory relief cause of\naction sought a declaration that defendant had been negligent or engaged in\nmisrepresentations.9\nB.     Typicality\n       The trial court found that plaintiff’s negligence or misrepresentation claims were\nnot typical of the class as he was neither the driver nor owner of the car subject to the\nred-light citation and had received the defendant’s letter as the result of his identity being\nstolen. On appeal, plaintiff argues that “[h]e is typical of others who were given a letter\nwhich concealed and threatened with falsities the true status of the citations and the\nconsequences of not immediately paying them.”\n       “Certification requires a showing that the class representative has claims or\ndefenses typical of the class.” (Fireside Bank, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 1090.) “ ‘It is the\nfact that the class plaintiff’s claims are typical and his representation of the class adequate\nwhich gives legitimacy to permitting him to bind class members who have notice of the\naction.’ ” (Caro, supra, 18 Cal.App.4th at p. 664, quoting Trotsky v. Los Angeles Fed.\n\n       9\n         Our holding applies equally to plaintiff’s requests for injunctive relief to the\nextent they are pled in his substantive causes of action. While the trial court did not\nseparately address his requests for injunctive relief in each of his substantive claims, in\nlight of our holding, the trial court’s finding that common issues did not predominate as\nto the negligence and misrepresentation causes of action was also sufficient to deny\ncertification as to the claims for injunctive relief.\n\n\n                                              28\n\fSav. & Loan Assn.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 146.) Typicality does not require a\nshowing that plaintiffs’ claims are identical to those of other class members, only that\ntheir claims are sufficiently similar. (See Classen v. Weller (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2111506\"><a href=\"/opinion/2111506/classen-v-weller/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

There can be no cognizable class\nunless it is first determined that members who make up the class have sustained the same\nor similar damage.’ ” (Caro, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 664, quoting Guidotti v. County of\nYolo (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2117301\"><a href=\"/opinion/2117301/guidotti-v-county-of-yolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1566-1567.)\n       On this record, substantial evidence supports the trial court’s conclusion that\nplaintiff’s claims were not typical of the proposed class. “Although difference in\ncomputing damages is not sufficient to deny class certification, differences in the actual\nexistence of damages or in the manner of incurring damages are appropriate\nconsiderations.” (Caro, supra, 18 Cal.App.4th at p. 665.) In Caro, a plaintiff sought to\nrepresent a class of consumers who had been misled by defendant’s claim that its orange\njuice was “fresh.” Plaintiff’s evidence, however, suggested that plaintiff was not\ndeceived by the “fresh” claim, but rather had been misled by defendant’s claim that the\njuice was “premium.” (Id. at p. 664.) The court affirmed the denial of class certification,\nstating “[b]ecause Caro did not claim to be misled in the manner the class was allegedly\ndeceived, the court could not ‘decide the issue of the rights of such individuals that might\npossibly exist.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) In this case, when plaintiff received defendant’s\nletter, he knew he had not been in Southern California in over seven years and that he had\nnever received any citation there. He therefore knew that he did not owe money to\nLACSC. Further, he knew he was the victim of identity theft and had reason to suspect\nthat this was the reason he had received defendant’s letter. As a result, while plaintiff\nalleges that the class members were misled into paying the balance listed in defendant’s\nletter, plaintiff himself was not misled in this way. Therefore, plaintiff’s manner of\n\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\fincurring damages (retaining an attorney to send a letter to defendant stating that he was\nan identity theft victim) is distinct from those of the putative class.10\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiff’s claims were\nnot typical of the class.11\nC.     Adequacy of Representation\n       The trial court concluded that plaintiff failed to meet his burden of showing that\nhis counsel, Ron Bochner, was qualified to serve as class counsel. On appeal, plaintiff\ncontends that Bochner’s qualifications were sufficiently established and that a prior\nfinding in an unrelated matter that Bochner engaged in questionable litigation tactics did\nnot support a finding that Bochner was unqualified to serve as class counsel in this action.\n\n\n\n       10\n          We note that plaintiff’s fraud and negligent misrepresentation causes of action\nboth require a finding that the class member reasonably relied on an alleged\nmisrepresentation. (Belasco, supra, 234 Cal.App.4th at p. 424; Cadlo, supra, 125\nCal.App.4th at p. 519.) “ ‘Several courts have held that class certification is\ninappropriate where a putative class representative is subject to unique defenses which\nthreaten to become the focus of the litigation.’ ” (Seastrom v. Neways, Inc. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2276114\"><a href=\"/opinion/2276114/seastrom-v-neways-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1496</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1502.) Because plaintiff knew he had been the victim of identity theft\nand knew he did not owe a fine, it appears plaintiff may be subject to a reliance defense\nthat is “unavailable or less available against other class members.” (Id. at p. 1503.) We\nneed not address whether defendant’s reliance defense against plaintiff would warrant\ndenial of certification in light of our conclusion that plaintiff has not established he was\nmisled in the way the unnamed class members were allegedly misled.\n       11\n          As we have stated, plaintiff’s declaratory relief claim involved two separate\nprongs—one seeking a declaration that defendant engaged in negligence or\nmisrepresentations by sending the letter and one seeking a declaration that defendant was\nengaged in debt collecting under the RFDCPA. As to the latter prong, the trial court\nfound plaintiff’s claims were “typical of other plaintiffs under the debt collection prong\nof his declaratory relief cause of action because he received the same type of letter as all\nother asserted class members.” Plaintiff contends that if his claims were typical under the\nRFDCPA prong of his declaratory relief claim, they are typical as to the other prong as\nwell: “whether [defendant’s] letter was legally appropriate or subject to the RFDCPA –\nare not readily distinguishable. It appears if he was typical for the one he was typical for\nthe other.” Because we find in the following section that plaintiff failed to meet his\nburden to establish the adequacy of his representation, we need not address this\nargument.\n\n\n                                              30\n\fIn the alternative, plaintiff argues that the trial court should have appointed replacement\nclass counsel, rather than denying certification of the entire class.\n       “In order for the representative to adequately represent the class, the\nrepresentative’s attorney must be qualified, experienced and generally able to conduct the\nproposed litigation.” (Miller v.

Lewis, however, was addressing class certification in a\nshareholder derivative action brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1.\n(Id. at p. 784.) Federal decisions recognize that “ ‘[i]n the context of a derivative suit\nunder Rule 23.1, courts have generally found that the defendant has the burden of\nshowing that the plaintiff is an inadequate representative.’ ” (In re Facebook, Inc.

For non-derivative class actions governed by Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23, however, plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing the adequacy of\nthe class representative. (See, e.g., Rattray v.

Similarly, in Sotelo, this\ncourt held that “[i]t is plaintiff’s burden to support each of the above factors [including\nadequacy of the class representative] with a factual showing.” (Sotelo, supra, 207\nCal.App.4th at p. 647.) Accordingly, plaintiff bore the burden of establishing Bochner’s\nadequacy as class counsel; defendant did not have to prove Bochner’s inadequacy.\n       Nor are we persuaded by plaintiff’s argument that Bochner’s qualifications should\nsimply have been “presumed.” Such a presumption is inconsistent with plaintiff’s burden\nto introduce sufficient evidence regarding adequacy of representation and this court’s\nobligation to “closely scrutinize” the qualifications of putative class counsel.

All Bochner stated in his declaration\nregarding his experience, qualifications and ability to represent such a large class was: “I\nam experienced in complex litigation. I have been named class counsel in eight cases, all\nof which settled or are in the process of settling, with money being distributed to the class\nand two other cases which are pending but have not been certified to date.” This\ndescription fails to provide any qualitative information about Bochner’s experience or\nability to conduct this litigation.

A well-known treatise advises attorneys on this\nsubject: “This is not the time to be modest about yourself. As part of your certification\nmotion, attach a résumé of your firm and each attorney who will be involved in the\naction. Detail your experience in prior class action litigation, indicating past cases in\nwhich you were involved, in what capacity, and the results obtained. At fairness hearings\nand hearings involving fee applications, judges occasionally will praise class counsel on\nthe record. Save any such transcripts and orders and quote these remarks in later motions\nas support for the proposition that class counsel is adequate.” (Weil & Brown, Cal.\nPractice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2011) ¶ 14:38.1.) By\ncontrast, where, as here, putative class counsel provides almost no details about their\nrelevant experience, they run the risk that the trial court will find them inadequate.13\n       The trial court’s concern about whether Bochner had the resources or capacity to\nadequately serve as counsel for such a large class also finds support in the record. First,\nBochner stated in his declaration that he was serving as class counsel in two putative\nclass actions. Bochner’s declaration, however, includes no statement regarding his\ncapacity to handle a large class action in light of those pending cases and his status as a\nsolo practitioner. Second, Bochner’s failure to timely pursue plaintiff’s claims or\ndiscovery against LACSC in this matter calls into question Bochner’s capacity to\ndiligently represent the class. This lawsuit was filed in July 2011 and plaintiff amended\nhis complaint four times. Yet plaintiff waited until December 2012 to add LACSC as a\nparty to the case. Three months later, the trial court granted LACSC’s demurrer without\nleave to amend because plaintiff had failed to file a timely claim pursuant to the\nGovernment Tort Claims Act. Further, class discovery opened in April 2012. Bochner,\nhowever, did not propound a subpoena to LACSC until July 2012 seeking documents on\n\n\n       13\n          Nor can it be said that the trial court’s concerns regarding Bochner’s resources\nor qualifications caught Bochner by surprise. The court issued a detailed tentative ruling\nexpressing its concerns regarding Bochner’s suitability as class counsel. Even after being\nmade aware of these concerns, however, Bochner failed to expand on his declaration’s\nmeager showing at the class certification hearing.\n\n\n                                             33\n\fLACSC’s red-light citation policies. When this did not yield sufficient information,\nplaintiff attempted to depose an LACSC official to have him or her confirm certain\nstatements county officials had made to the press regarding LACSC’s red-light citation\npolicies. Bochner did not issue a deposition subpoena, however, until May 17, 2013 (10\ndays before his reply brief in support of certification was filed). LACSC objected to this\nsubpoena as it failed to include a check to cover their expenses, so plaintiff issued a\nsecond subpoena on July 8, 2013, noticing a deposition for August 12, 2013—a mere\neight days before the class certification hearing. It was not until September 9, 2013, that\nBochner filed a motion to compel LACSC’s appearance at a deposition.\n       Our decision should not be read as holding that a solo practitioner can never serve\nas adequate class counsel, including in complex or large class actions. Rather, we hold\nthat given Bochner’s performance in this action as well as his failure to establish his\nqualifications before the trial court, substantial evidence supports the trial court’s\nconclusion that Bochner was not qualified to serve as class counsel in this case.\n       Plaintiff next argues that the trial court erred in finding Bochner an inadequate\nclass counsel based on the American Agencies court decision. Plaintiff contends that the\nstandard for finding inadequate class counsel based on an ethical challenge was not\nsatisfied. He relies on the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Reliable Money Order, Inc. v.\nMcKnight Sales Co., Inc. (7th Cir. 2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In that case, the court inquired\ninto the nature of misconduct by an attorney in a class action warranting denial of class\ncertification. The court noted that “[n]ot any ethical breach justifies the grave option of\ndenying class certification. No doubt, misconduct that prejudices the class or creates a\ndirect conflict between counsel and the class requires such denial . . . . [¶] Nevertheless,\neven ‘serious’ or ‘major’ ethical violations – not prejudicial to the class – can require\ndenial of class certification.” (Id. at pp. 498-499.) The court articulated the following\nstandard: “unethical conduct, not necessarily prejudicial to the class, nevertheless raises\na ‘serious doubt’ about the adequacy of class counsel when the misconduct jeopardizes\nthe court’s ability to reach a just and proper outcome in the case.” (Id. at p. 499.)\n\n\n\n                                              34\n\f       Plaintiff argues that there “were no facts and no finding that [Bochner’s]\nrepresentation of the class would lead to an inability to reach a just and proper outcome in\nthis case” and, therefore, the “court’s denial of certification . . . on this basis appears to be\nbased on an erroneous assumption or improper criteria.” Plaintiff misreads the trial\ncourt’s order. After finding Bochner’s declaration regarding his qualifications inadequate\nfor the reasons discussed above, the court stated: “In light of these facts, the court finds\nthat plaintiff has not met his burden of showing Mr. Bochner is qualified to represent the\nproposed class. [¶] Even if plaintiff had met his burden, the court is concerned with\ncounsel’s competence to represent the proposed class in light of the findings of Judge\nBrick in . . . the Lee v. American Agencies case.” It is thus clear that plaintiff’s failure to\nestablish Bochner’s qualification was the reason the trial court found Bochner to be\ninadequate—not solely or necessarily Bochner’s actions in the American Agencies case.\nAs just discussed, this decision was not an abuse of discretion. (Linder, supra, 23 Cal.4th\nat p. 436 [“ ‘Any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.’ ”].)\nFurther, we reject plaintiff’s contention that the trial court erred by considering Bochner’s\nperformance in the American Agencies case. Even if not sufficiently serious to warrant\ndisqualification of counsel, bad faith or dubious litigation tactics by class counsel can\njeopardize class members’ claims. It was therefore not unreasonable for the trial court to\nconclude that prior findings by two courts that Bochner had engaged in such tactics cast\ndoubt on his ability to “competently represent the class.”14\n\n\n       14\n           Bochner has requested we take judicial notice of three documents that he\ncontends relate to the finding by the American Agencies court that he engaged in bad\nfaith litigation tactics. We grant the request for judicial notice of the Court of Appeal\ndecision that reversed the trial court’s award of attorneys’ fees. The trial court cited this\ndecision in its order in this case. (See Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d)(1).) We deny the\nrequest to take judicial notice of discovery responses Bochner received in the American\nAgencies case, and a superior court order overruling a demurrer in another of Bochner’s\ncases. Bochner contends that these two documents are relevant to show that he did not\nengage in “dubious litigation tactics” in the American Agencies case. We decline\nBochner’s invitation to relitigate Judge Brick’s findings or the Court of Appeal’s decision\nregarding his litigation tactics. (Jordan v. Superstar Sandcars (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

As plaintiff’s\ncited authority makes clear, however, trial courts have “wide discretion to determine the\nremedial consequences” where class counsel is inadequate, and courts “may deny\ncertification outright.” (1 Newberg on Class Actions (5th ed. 2011) § 3.87, pp. 436-437.)\nThere are a number of examples of federal courts denying class certification solely based\non the inadequacy of class counsel. (See, e.g., Gomez v. St. Vincent Health, Inc.

In its opposition brief to the motion for class certification,\ndefendant referenced the superior court’s findings in the American Agencies case and\nargued that “[t]he conduct documented by the [American Agencies] court casts\nsubstantial doubt on whether Attorney Bochner can effectively conduct this litigation and\nprotect the proposed class’s interest. As a result, the Court should deny the motion for\nclass certification.” In his reply brief, plaintiff responded to this argument, but did not\nraise the possibility that alternative counsel could be appointed to represent the class. It\nwas not until the class certification hearing on August 20, 2013, that Bochner raised the\npossibility that he could locate replacement counsel if the court determined he was\ninadequate. Even then, however, Bochner did not identify replacement counsel or\nindicate whether anyone was actually ready, willing, and able to step into the case which\n\n\n\n\n1416, 1421, fn. 2 [denying request to take judicial notice of documents not before the trial\ncourt at the time it made its ruling].)\n\n\n                                              36\n\fhad been pending since 2011. In these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying certification outright.\nD.     Substantial Benefit\n       As a final basis for denying class certification, the trial court found that a “class\naction is not the superior method of obtaining relief where proposed class counsel is not\nqualified and only a declaratory relief allegation, which may not provide complete relief\nto the class, appears to qualify for class treatment.” Plaintiff argues that the trial court\nabused its discretion in making this finding because plaintiff is, in fact, an adequate\nrepresentative and because he intends “to pursue all RFDCPA remedies based on the\ndeclaratory relief” cause of action.\n       “In determining the superiority of class treatment, the trial court must weigh the\nrespective benefits and burdens of class litigation; maintenance of the class action will\nonly be permitted where substantial benefits accrue to both the litigants and the court.”\n(Soderstedt v. CBIZ Southern California, LLC (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 156.)\nSubstantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that plaintiff had failed to meet his\nburden of demonstrating that class treatment of his claims would provide a substantial\nbenefit to the parties and the court. The only claim that survived the trial court’s\ncommonality and typicality findings (findings which we have now affirmed) was a\ndeclaratory relief action seeking a declaration that defendant was engaged in debt\ncollection. Plaintiffs’ complaint, however, sought this declaration only to address a\npotential defense the defendant had raised in support of its demurrer to plaintiff’s\ncomplaint. Relief on such a narrow ground for the class would hardly constitute a\n“substantial benefit.” Nor can we say that class members would benefit at all from\nhaving their claim advanced by an inadequate representative.\n       Plaintiff asserts in his brief that he “does intend to pursue all RFDCPA remedies\nbased on the declaratory relief, just as stated in the [Fourth Amended Complaint].”\nHowever, his fourth amended complaint asserts no causes of action under the RFDCPA,\nnor does it seek a declaration that defendant violated the RFDCPA. Rather, in the\ncomplaint, plaintiff “seeks a declaration of rights and duties regarding whether\n\n\n                                                37\n\fDefendants were debt collecting under the [RFDCPA]. If so, it appears Defendants\nviolated certain notice provisions under the Act . . . . If not, they have no such defenses.”\nIt was not until the class certification hearing that plaintiff indicated his desire to amend\nhis complaint for a fifth time to assert these causes of action. Plaintiff renews this request\nbefore us, requesting in his opening brief that “if the court reverses on the adequacy\nissue, leave to amend to name RFDCPA causes be allowed.” Plaintiff’s belated requests\nfor leave to amend confirm the trial court’s finding that plaintiff’s declaratory relief cause\nof action, as currently pled, would fail to provide complete relief to the class.\nE.     Staying the Class Certification Hearing Pending Discovery\n       As we have discussed, substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that\nplaintiff failed to show that defendant’s liability could be established through common\nproof of LACSC’s policies. Plaintiff contends on appeal that LACSC failed to cooperate\nwith a deposition subpoena that sought to have a LACSC official testify regarding\nLACSC’s red-light camera citation policies. Plaintiff argues that if the evidence\nregarding LACSC’s policies was inadequate for class certification purposes, the trial\ncourt should have deferred ruling on his certification motion, rather than denying it.\n       To begin, plaintiff fails to properly raise this argument in his opening brief. His\nentire argument on this point consists of a two-sentence paragraph entirely devoid of\ncitations to the record or applicable legal authority. “Issues do not have a life of their\nown: if they are not raised or supported by argument or citation to authority, we consider\nthe issues waived.” (Jones v. Superior Court (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2243644\"><a href=\"/opinion/2243644/jones-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 99.) Given\nplaintiffs’ failure to provide even a modicum of support in the record or case law for his\nposition that the trial court should have continued the class certification hearing, we deem\nthis argument waived.\n       However, even considering plaintiff’s arguments on the merits, we find no abuse\nof discretion. “The decision to grant or deny a continuance is committed to the sound\ndiscretion of the trial court.” (Forthmann v. Boyer (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2294347\"><a href=\"/opinion/2294347/forthmann-v-boyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 984.) We\nwill not disturb the court’s ruling in the absence of a clear abuse of the court’s discretion.\n(Ibid.) The burden is on the party seeking a continuance to permit additional discovery to\n\n\n                                              38\n\fmake the request. Where a party fails to request that a motion be continued to allow for\nadditional discovery, the party waives any objection to the court ruling on the motion.\n(Lewinter v. Genmar Industries, Inc.

Plaintiff filed his certification\nmotion on September 28, 2012, without referencing any issues regarding LACSC\ndiscovery. In his reply brief, filed May 28, 2013, plaintiff first noted LACSC’s refusal to\ncomply with a deposition subpoena and stated that if the “court desires further evidence\non [LACSC’s] practices and policies, plaintiff asks leave to supplement this brief and\nproduce that evidence.” (Emphasis added.) Similarly, in his August 13, 2013,\nsupplemental brief, plaintiff asked that “if the certification of the class turns on evidence\nthat may be provided by LASC, the court allow the certification hearing to be continued\nto such time as plaintiff is able to obtain such evidence.” (Emphasis added.) Plaintiff\nnever indicated his belief that further discovery was necessary; rather, he requested that\nthe court continue the class certification hearing only if the court determined further\nevidence was needed.\n       At the class certification hearing, plaintiff again failed to make any request for a\ncontinuance of the hearing or the court’s ruling. By this time, plaintiff had received the\ncourt’s lengthy and detailed tentative ruling and was aware of its reasoning and findings\nthat plaintiff had failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that class certification was\nwarranted. Despite this fact, plaintiff did not request that the court delay its ruling until\nfurther discovery on LACSC’s policies could be completed. Rather, after reiterating his\nattempts to obtain discovery from LACSC, Bochner simply stated: “We’ve tried every\n\n\n                                              39\n\fwhich way to get [LACSC] to cooperate, and they’re not cooperating. So regardless of\nwhether this motion is granted or not granted, there is going to be a motion to compel\nthem to appear . . . at deposition [sic] and to explain themselves.” Accordingly, plaintiff\nwaived any objection to the trial court’s failure to defer ruling on plaintiff’s class\ncertification motion. (Lewinter, supra, 26 Cal.App.4th at p. 1224.)\n       Even liberally construing the record to find that plaintiff requested a continuance\nto permit additional discovery, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\nimplicitly denying this request.

In these circumstances, the trial court did not err in implicitly\ndenying plaintiff’s continuance request.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The order denying class certification is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       15\n          In its order denying class certification, the trial court referenced Bochner’s\nstatements that he had been attempting to depose LACSC. In discussing whether the\nfalsity of the statements could be determined by common proof, the court stated: “With\nrespect to the statement that GCS might employ alternate means of collection . . . plaintiff\nsuggests in supplemental papers filed on August 13, 2013, that he has attempted, but has\nbeen unsuccessful to date, in getting testimony from the LACSC on this issue. It is\nunnecessary to resolve this issue because, even if plaintiff had evidence that LACSC had\na policy against employing these alternate means of collection, plaintiff has failed to\nshow that the other elements of the misrepresentation claims may be established by\ncommon facts and/or evidence.” Nowhere, however, did the trial court expressly\nconstrue Bochner’s statements as a request for a continuance.\n\n\n                                              40\n\f                                        _________________________\n                                        Miller, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nKline, P.J.\n\n\n_________________________\nStewart, J.\n\n\n\n\nA140351, Howard v.
