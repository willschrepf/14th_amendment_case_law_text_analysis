Because we lack\n\njurisdiction to consider DeVaughn’s appeal absent a certificate of appealability (“COA”),\n\fwe will construe his notice of appeal as a request for a COA under 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c).\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we will deny the request.\n\n       DeVaughn is currently incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary in Terre\n\nHaute, Indiana, serving a sentence imposed by the Superior Court of the District of\n\nColumbia. Before being transferred to Terre Haute, DeVaughn was incarcerated at the\n\nUnited States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. While DeVaughn was housed in\n\nLewisburg, an inmate disturbance erupted in the recreation yard involving District of\n\nColumbia inmates and Hispanic inmates. DeVaughn was issued a misconduct report for\n\nhis participation in the disturbance. Following a disciplinary hearing, DeVaughn was\n\nfound guilty and was sanctioned with sixty days in segregation, a loss of privileges, and a\n\nforfeiture of 1372 good time credits.\n\n       In April 2003, while still incarcerated in Lewisburg, DeVaughn filed a habeas\n\ncorpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 in the District Court, challenging the investigation\n\nand disciplinary hearing leading to the forfeiture of his good time credits. Without\n\nconducting an evidentiary hearing, the District Court rejected DeVaughn’s claims on the\n\nmerits and denied his habeas corpus petition. DeVaughn appeals.\n\n       We consider first whether DeVaughn’s habeas corpus petition is properly filed\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2254. Section 2241 authorizes district courts to issue a writ\n\nof habeas corpus to a state or federal prisoner who “is in custody in violation of the\n\nConstitution or laws or treaties of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(3). Section\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f2254 is more specific and confers jurisdiction on district courts to “entertain an\n\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the\n\njudgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the\n\nConstitution or laws or treaties of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a). A prisoner\n\nchallenging either the validity or execution of his state court sentence must rely on the\n\nmore specific provisions of § 2254 and may not proceed under § 2241. See Coady v.\n\nVaughn, 251 F.3d 480, 485 (3d Cir. 2001). For purposes of the federal habeas corpus\n\nstatute, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia is a “State court.” See Madley v.\n\nUnited States Parole Comm’n, 278 F.3d 1306, 1309 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\n\n       Here, DeVaughn challenges the execution of his state sentence, i.e., the forfeiture\n\nof his good time credits. Accordingly, he must proceed under § 2254, not § 2241, and he\n\nmust obtain a COA under § 2253(c) before we can consider his appeal. Coady, 251 F.3d\n\nat 485-86. Neither we nor the District Court granted a COA. Absent a COA, we lack\n\njurisdiction to consider DeVaughn’s appeal. See Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336\n\n(2003). Rather than dismiss the appeal outright, however, we will construe DeVaughn’s\n\nnotice of appeal as a request for a COA.1 See Coady, 251 F.3d at 486; Fed. R. App. P.\n\n22(b)(2).\n\n\n\n\n   1\n    In deciding whether to grant a COA, we have considered the arguments raised the\nparties’ briefs.\n\n                                              3\n\f       We may issue a COA “only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the\n\ndenial of a constitutional right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2). Where the district court denies\n\na habeas petition on the merits, a COA should issue when jurists of reason would debate\n\nthe correctness of the district court’s decision. See Miller-El, 537 U.S. at 338.\n\n       DeVaughn falls short of satisfying this standard. His primary contention on appeal\n\nis that the District Court failed to address his argument that he remains subject to certain\n\nprovisions of the District of Columbia Code (“D.C. Code”) governing the forfeiture of\n\ngood time credits. DeVaughn is correct that the District Court did not expressly address\n\nthis claim. Regardless, DeVaughn has failed to explain how the length of his detention\n\nwould have been any shorter if any particular provisions of the D.C. Code had been\n\napplied.2\n\n       DeVaughn’s submissions to us are devoid of any other argument calling into\n\nquestion the legality of the forfeiture of good time credits or any other sanction imposed.3\n\n   2\n    We need not decide whether any of the cited provisions of the D.C. Code applies to\nDistrict of Columbia inmates such as DeVaughn who are in the custody of the Bureau of\nPrisons. We note DeVaughn’s argument (apparently in the alternative) that if he were\ntreated as a federal prisoner, he would be subject to the forfeiture of no more than 54\ngood time credits per calendar year. He fails to cite any authority for this proposition.\nWe are aware that a federal prisoner may earn up to 54 good time credits per year under\n18 U.S.C. § 3624(b). This statute mentions no limit on the number of good time credits a\nfederal prisoner may forfeit per year, however. One of the federal regulations DeVaughn\ncites specifically allows for the forfeiture of up to 100 per cent of earned good time credit\nwithout any numerical limitation. See 28 C.F.R. § 541.13 (Table 3).\n   3\n    Generally, an appellant’s failure to raise on appeal an argument he pressed in the\ndistrict court results in a waiver of that argument. See Nagle v. Alspach, 8 F.3d 141, 143\n(3d Cir. 1993) (citing Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(3) and (5)).\n\n                                              4\n\fNonetheless, we have reviewed the District Court’s decision, in particular its rejection of\n\nDeVaughn’s claim of a violation of due process in the disciplinary investigation and\n\nhearings leading to the imposition of sanctions. For substantially the reasons given by the\n\nDistrict Court, we are convinced that jurists of reason would not debate the correctness of\n\nits decision.\n\n       In sum, DeVaughn has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a\n\nconstitutional right. Accordingly, we will deny his request for a COA.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f",

R. App. P. 28(a)(3) and (5)).\n\n                                              4\n\fNonetheless, we have reviewed the District Court’s decision, in particular its rejection of\n\nDeVaughn’s claim of a violation of due process in the disciplinary investigation and\n\nhearings leading to the imposition of sanctions. For substantially the reasons given by the\n\nDistrict Court, we are convinced that jurists of reason would not debate the correctness of\n\nits decision.\n\n       In sum, DeVaughn has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a\n\nconstitutional right. Accordingly, we will deny his request for a COA.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f</pre>",
