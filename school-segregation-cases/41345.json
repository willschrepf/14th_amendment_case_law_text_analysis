Unick did not present competent credible\nevidence of reasonable attorney fees, and therefore did not meet his burden of proof.\nAccordingly, the trial court's denial of Unick's attorney fees is affirmed.\n                             Facts and Procedural History\n       {¶4}   During the spring of 1999, Unick and Kovachik jointly formed Pro-Cision,\nInc. They each invested $25,000.00 in the company, and each had a 50% ownership\ninterest. In order to obtain lines of credit for the company, both Kovachik and Unick\npledged personal assets as collateral. Unick pledged much more than Kovachick,\nincluding his tools and power equipment, his home, and two vehicles. Pursuant to the\nterms of the parties' corporation agreement, each owner had the right of first refusal to\nthe other owner's stock ownership in the event of a buy-out.\n       {¶5}   Soon after forming the company, Unick's son became ill and Unick needed\nto liquidate his stock in the company in order to raise money to care for his son.\nSubsequent to negotiations between the two parties, they entered a Stock Sale\nAgreement on February 7, 2000, wherein Unick was identified as the seller and Pro-\nCision as the purchaser. The agreement required Pro-Cision to pay $15,000 for Unick's\nstock in monthly installments of $275, with a final lump sum payment of $8,400. The\n\f                                                                                         -3-\n\n\nagreement states that Pro-Cision had effected the removal of Unick's name from certain\ncorporate obligations, including a loan from Second National Bank. However, the\nagreement notes that Pro-Cision had been unable to remove Unick's name from an\nobligation to National Machine Tool Financial Corporation, and thus Kovachick personally\njoined Pro-Cision to indemnify Unick from that particular obgligation.\n       {¶6}   The agreement further states that Pro-Cision will indemnify Unick and hold\nhim harmless \"from all loss, cost, damage, or expense, including reasonable attorneys'\nfees arising from\" all liabilities of Pro-Cision and any taxes owed, as well as any\n\"misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or default in any obligation on the part of [Pro-\nCision] under this agreement.\" Finally, the agreement designates responsibility for\nlitigation expenses as follows: \"In the event of a default under this agreement, the\ndefaulting party shall reimburse the nondefaulting party or parties for all costs and\nexpenses reasonably incurred by the nondefaulting party or parties in connection with the\ndefault, including without limitation attorney's fees. Additionally, in the event a suit or\naction is filed to enforce this agreement, the prevailing party or parties shall be\nreimbursed by the other party for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the\nsuit or action, including without limitation, reasonabe attorney's fees at the trial level and\non appeal.\"\n       {¶7}   Pro-Cision initially made a few installment payments per the agreement, but\nquickly ceased paying as required by the agreement. Additionally, the removal of Unick's\nname from the Second National Bank loan did not occur. Despite numerous requests,\nSecond National Bank refused to release Unick as a guarantor, due to Pro-Cision's poor\nfinancial condition.    Unick stated that he discovered the loan issue when he\nunsuccessfully sought to refinance his house, around April of 2000.\n       {¶8}   Unick retained Harrington Hoppe & Mitchell (\"HHM\") to determine his rights\nand potential actions regarding the Stock Sale Agreement. Unick incurred $32,251.72 in\nfees from HHM's services from 2001 to 2008. On April 17, 2002, Unick filed for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy, primarily using the services of another attorney who specialized in bankruptcy\nproceedings, incurring $1,000 in attorney's fees.\n\f                                                                                      -4-\n\n\n       {¶9}   Unick's attorney at the time of the Stock Sale Agreement had represented to\nUnick that he had been released as guarantor of the Second National Bank loan, and\nUnick relied on that statement when executing the agreement. Unick filed a malpractice\nsuit against his original attorney on September 10, 2002, primarily using the services of\nSemple and Eicher throughout the malpractice proceedings. Unick obtained a judgment\nfor $250,000 on September 22, 2004 but settled for a reduced amount of $200,000 due\nto the malpractice insurance coverage limits. The judgment award was deposited into\nUnick's bankruptcy trust, and on March 21, 2005, the bankruptcy court authorized the\ntrustee to pay Eicher $61,201.80 for legal fees and expenses owed by Unick related to\nthe malpractice action.\n       {¶10} On April 13, 2005, represented by HHM, Unick filed a complaint against\nPro-Cision, and against Kovachik individually, claiming breach of contract, promissory\nestoppel, misrepresentation, fraud in the inducement, and anticipatory repudiation.\nDuring the discovery process, Unick filed a Civ.R. 37 motion for sanctions against Pro-\nCision for its failure to comply with court orders for discovery, and requested $1950.50 in\nattorney's fees. The trial court granted the motion on May 17, 2006, but summarily\nconcluded that the reasonable attorney's fees associated with the motion were $450.00.\n       {¶11} On February 28, 2007, Unick filed a Partial Motion for Summary Judgment,\nsolely addressing the breach of contract claim. Unick demanded $9,175.00, which was\nthe amount still due under the parties' repayment clause of the Stock Sale Agreement.\nUnick also demanded $216,720.68 for all losses accrued as a result of Pro-Cision's and\nKovachik's failure to indemnify Unick from the Second National Bank loan, including,\namong other things, all legal expenses during the bankruptcy, malpractice, and breach of\ncontract proceedings up to the present date. According to the docket, on March 21,\n2007, Pro-Cision filed a motion contra summary judgment, and a motion to strike the\nsupporting affidavit from Unick's motion, but both of these motions are missing from the\nrecord.\n       {¶12} On June 22, 2007, the magistrate concluded that Pro-Cision and Kovachik\nhad breached both the payment portion and the indemnification portion of the parties'\n\f                                                                                      -5-\n\n\nagreement. The magistrate concluded that the terms of the agreement obligated Pro-\nCision to pay all damages \"in connection with the default,\" including incidental and\nconsequential damages flowing from the breach.          The magistrate also found that\nKovachik assumed individual liability for the failure to release Unick from the Second\nNational Bank loan. The decision deferred ruling on damages until a later hearing.\n       {¶13} On October 16, 2007, upon consideration of the objections filed by Pro-\nCision and Kovachik, the trial court found that the magistrate erred in determining that\nKovachik had agreed to be held individually accountable for failure to remove Unick's\nname from the Second National Bank loan. The trial court remanded the magistrate's\ndecision with instructions to rule on Pro-Cision's motion to strike and any remaining\nissues.\n       {¶14} On May 13, 2008, upon remand, the magistrate overruled Unick's summary\njudgment motion as against Kovachik, because he was not identified in the agreement as\nthe purchaser, and was only individually identified as a responsible party regarding a\nseparate loan that was not at issue in the case. The magistrate granted Pro-Cision's\nmotion to strike, finding that Unick's affidavit and all other documents regarding specific\ndamages lacked the requisite foundation, and that no evidence was submitted to\nestablish the reasonableness of the claimed attorney fees. The magistrate noted that\nUnick had already received a malpractice verdict and settlement in the amount of\n$200,000 from his former attorney. The magistrate partially sustained Unick's motion\nagainst Pro-Cision for breach of contract, and the damages claim of $9,170.00. The\nmagistrate found that material facts still remained regarding all other issues. On July 22,\n2008, the trial court overruled Unick's objections, and adopted the magistrate's decision.\n       {¶15} In September of 2008, HHM withdrew as counsel, and Eicher filed an entry\nof appearance as counsel for Unick. Unick continued his litigation against Kovachik\nindividually and against Pro-Cision for claims beyond the $9,170 awarded in summary\njudgment, including the claims of promissory estoppel, misrepresentation, fraud in the\ninducement, breach of contract and anticipatory breach. The matter proceeded to trial on\nJanuary 13, 2009.\n\f                                                                                      -6-\n\n\n       {¶16} One of the main issues at trial was the amount of reasonable attorney's fees\nto be awarded as a result of Pro-Cision's breach. Unick argued that but for the fact that\nhe was not released from the Second National Bank debt as contractually provided, he\nwould not have entered into bankruptcy. He argued that all of HHM's fees, all of the fees\naccumulated from the bankruptcy proceedings, and all of the fees of his present attorney\nwere therefore chargeable to Pro-Cision.\n       {¶17} Attorney Donald Loepp was presented by Unick as an expert qualified to\ntestify regarding legal fees. Loepp provided his opinion over Pro-Cision's objection, as\nLoepp had not submitted a report. Loepp described the claimed fees listed in Plaintiff's\nExhibit 4, including $32,251.72 for HHM's service from 2001 to 2008 in various\nproceedings, $1,000.00 for bankruptcy counsel's services, $75,098.88 for Eicher's service\nin the malpractice proceedings, and a flat fee of $15,000.00 for Eicher's service in the\npresent action, starting in August of 2008. Loepp opined that all of the charges in Exhibit\n4 were commensurate with the work that was required and performed.\n       {¶18} Loepp testified that HHM's fees were primarily related to the contract action.\nLoepp noted that the docket indicated that the case has been extremely litigious, and\nopined that HHM would therefore need to perform the extensive services listed, and that\nthe fees charged were reasonable. Loepp guessed that HHM's fees were akin to flat rate\ncharges for each task, and opined that the fees charged for the tasks shown were\nreasonable fees within the legal community. Loepp identified Eicher's $15,000.00 fee as\nrelating to the present proceedings, but offered no further opinion regarding the fee.\n       {¶19} Loepp conceded that the HHM billing had no indication of hours worked or\nof the hourly billing rate for any of their fees. Loepp further agreed that it was not\npossible to surmise HHM's billing rates, or to deduce how many hours had been spent on\nUnick's matters. Loepp admitted that he was aware of the sanctions granted earlier in the\nproceedings, but did not review whether HHM's requested attorney's fees for those\nsanctions were included a second time in the billing in Exhibit 4. Loepp also noted that\nEicher represented Unick in the malpractice action on a contingency basis, and that the\nbankruptcy court had determined and paid that fee out of the $200,000.00 settlement.\n\f                                                                                     -7-\n\n\n       {¶20} On June 3, 2009, the magistrate determined that all of Unick's claims, apart\nfrom Pro-Cision's breach of the Stock Sale Agreement, were meritless. The magistrate\nfound that the fees associated with Unick's bankruptcy and malpractice proceedings were\nnot contemplated in the Stock Sale Agreement. Regarding the remaining fees from HHM\nand Eicher, the magistrate found that there was \"no evidence of time spent or an hourly\nrate for any of the claimed services and it is apparent that the services were in part\nblended with and in some instances directed primarily towards plaintiff's malpractice\nlitigation and bankruptcy.\"\n       {¶21} The magistrate noted that, despite being given full opportunity to present\nadequate evidence to prove the reasonableness of the attorney's fees, Unick left the\nmagistrate \"only able to speculate or surmise how much time was involved for related\nservices, which based upon the nature of the presentation of the evidence, would be\nnecessarily [sic] to extrapolate the rate of charge for the services presented by the\ninvoices.\" The magistrate reaffirmed that Pro-Cision was liable for breach of contract,\nand recommended that judgment be entered in Unick's favor only in the amount of\n$9170.00, plus interest.\n       {¶22} On September 10, 2009, the trial court affirmed the magistrate's decision,\nand Unick filed a timely notice of appeal.\n                              Reasonable Attorney's Fees\n       {¶23} In Unick's sole assignment of error, he asserts:\n       {¶24} \"The trial court committed reversible error in holding the party who is\npursuing payment of attorney's fees pursuant to a written contract must provide evidence\nof actual time expended by the attorney or the actual rate charged by the attorney for\nclaimed fees.\"\n       {¶25} Pursuant to the \"American Rule,\" each party in a lawsuit must generally\nbear its own attorney fees. Sorin v. Bd. of Edn. of Warrensville Hts. School Dist. (1976),\n46 Ohio St.2d 177, 179, 75 O.O.2d 224, 347 N.E.2d 527. However, a court may be\nempowered to award attorney fees where there is a contractual agreement between the\nparties to shift fees. McConnell v. Hunt Sports Ent. (1999), 132 Ohio App.3d 657, 699,\n\f                                                                                       -8-\n\n\n725 N.E.2d 1193. Fee-shifting contractual provisions are generally enforceable \"so long\nas the fees awarded are fair, just and reasonable as determined by the trial court upon\nfull consideration of all of the circumstances of the case.\" Wilborn v. Bank One Corp.,\n121 Ohio St.3d 546, 549, 2009-Ohio-306, 906 N.E.2d 396, at ¶8, quoting Nottingdale\nHomeowner's Assn. v. Darby (1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 32, 514 N.E.2d 702, syllabus.\n       {¶26} When a court is empowered to award attorney fees, \"the amount of such\nfees is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Unless the amount of fees determined\nis so high or so low as to shock the conscience, an appellate court will not interfere.\"\nBittner v. Tri-County Toyota, Inc. (1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 143, 146, 569 N.E.2d 464,\nquoting Brooks v. Hurst Buick-Pontiac-Olds-GMC, Inc. (1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 85, 91, 23\nOBR 150, 491 N.E.2d 345. Thus a trial court's decision regarding the award of attorney\nfees should not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\n       {¶27} Although a contractual provision may entitle a prevailing party to attorney's\nfees, the prevailing party still has the burden of proving the reasonableness of the fees.\nStonehenge Land Co. v. Beazer Homes Invests., L.L.C., 177 Ohio App.3d 7, 2008-Ohio-\n148, 893 N.E.2d 855, at ¶45. A trial court's determination of reasonable attorney's fees\nmust generally begin with a calculation of \"the number of hours reasonably expended on\nthe case times an hourly fee.\" Bittner at 145. This \"lodestar figure\" has been determined\nto be \"[t]he most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee,\"\nbecause it \"provides an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value\nof a lawyer's services.\" Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983), 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933,\n1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40. See, also, Gisbrecht v. Barnhart (2002), 535 U.S. 789, 800-802,\n122 S.Ct. 1817, 152 L.Ed.2d 996.\n       {¶28} In order to establish this minimum baseline for the determination of attorney\nfees, the party requesting the award bears the burden of providing evidence of any hours\nworked that would be properly billed to the client. The hours worked should be necessary\nto the action and should not include \"hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise\nunnecessary.\" Hensley at 434. The requesting party \"should exercise 'billing judgment'\nwith respect to hours worked, * * * and should maintain billing time records in a manner\n\f                                                                                        -9-\n\n\nthat will enable a reviewing court to identify distinct claims\". Hensley at 437 (citations\nomitted). Even in the event that an attorney provides representation on a contingent-fee\nbasis, the attorney must \"keep an accurate record of time and resources expended\" in\norder to be able to provide satisfactory proof of the reasonable value of the legal services\nrendered. Reid, Johnson, Downes, Andrachik & Webster v. Lansberry (1994), 68 Ohio\nSt.3d 570, 576, 629 N.E.2d 431, at fn.3.\n       {¶29} The requesting party also bears the burden of proving the attorney's hourly\nrate, and of establishing that the hourly rate is reasonable. \"[T]he burden is on the fee\napplicant to produce satisfactory evidence-in addition to the attorney's own affidavits-that\nthe requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services\nby lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation.\"              Blum v.\nStenson (1984), 465 U.S. 886, 895-896, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891, at fn.11.\n       {¶30} Once the requesting party has adequately proven an appropriate number of\nhours worked and the attorney's reasonable hourly fee, the trial court may modify the\nbaseline calculation by considering the factors listed in former DR 2-106(B), now found in\nProf. Cond. R. 1.5, which include \"the time and labor involved in maintaining the litigation;\nthe novelty and difficulty of the questions involved; the professional skill required to\nperform the necessary legal services; the attorney's inability to accept other cases; the\nfee customarily charged; the amount involved and the results obtained; any necessary\ntime limitations; the nature and length of the attorney/client relationship; the experience,\nreputation, and ability of the attorney; and whether the fee is fixed or contingent. All\nfactors may not be applicable in all cases and the trial court has the discretion to\ndetermine which factors to apply, and in what manner that application will affect the initial\ncalculation.\" Bittner at 145-146.\n       {¶31} In Pracker v. Dolan (Apr. 21, 1995), 11th Dist. No. 94-G-1867, the appellee\nhad been awarded $6,450.73 in attorney's fees. The attorney's hourly rate for services,\nas well as the reasonableness of the rate, had been established. Id. at *4. However, the\nprevailing party submitted billing statements that only listed the specific activities of the\nattorney and the total number of hours expended, but did not list the amount of time spent\n\f                                                                                        - 10 -\n\n\nfor each activity. Id. The Eleventh District found that the appellee had presented\ninsufficient evidence to allow a reviewable determination of reasonable attorney fees. Id.\n       {¶32} In Stonehenge, a jury awarded $100,000.00 in attorney's fees to\nStonehenge, which the trial court subsequently reversed pursuant to a Civ.R. 50(B)\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict. Stonehenge at ¶17. At trial, Stonehenge had\npresented evidence as to the reasonableness of the attorney fees solely through the\ntestimony of the company's owner. Id. at ¶44. The owner testified that the total attorney\nfees charged to the company were reasonable because they were comparable to the fee\nestimates that other attorneys had provided for his action. Id. at ¶47. The hourly rates\nhad apparently been provided in certain attorney invoices, but the owner was not able to\ntestify \"whether the hourly rates charged are typical for the market, which hourly rates\nwere charged to Stonehenge, exactly who had worked on the case, or how much\nStonehenge had actually been charged. He did not personally review Stonehenge's\nattorney invoices.\" Id. The reviewing court concluded that the evidence presented was\nnot sufficient for a determination of reasonable attorney fees, and upheld the trial court's\ndecision to deny attorney fees. Id.\n       {¶33} Thus, a complaining party bears the burden of initially proving the number of\nhours an attorney spent on his case, the hourly rate that the attorney charges, and the\nreasonableness of that hourly rate, after which point the trial court may exercise its\ndiscretion to modify the amount pursuant to the factors described in Prof. Cond. R. 1.5.\nPursuant to the application of this rule in Pracker and Stonhenge, when a prevailing party\ndoes not present sufficient evidence to support a request for attorney's fees, the trial court\nhas the discretion to deny the request in its entirety.\n       {¶34} Unick presents a number of arguments in his attempt to demonstrate that\nhe met his burden of proof and that he should have been awarded attorney's fees. He\nargues that he was not obligated to prove the number of hours worked by his attorneys,\nthat the trial court's prior award of attorney fees during a sanctions hearing became the\n\"law of the case\" regarding the reasonableness of fees, that he had the contractual right\n\f                                                                                    - 11 -\n\n\nto collect attorney fees, and that Pro-Cision failed to prove that Unick's requested fees\nwere unreasonable.\n       {¶35} In support of his claim for attorney's fees, Unick presented the testimony of\nLoepp and presented a compendium of legal fees charged by Eicher and HHM as an\nexhibit. The flat fee of $15,000.00 charged by Eicher did not include any explanation of\nhours worked or rates charged, and no further clarification was provided in Loepp's\ntestimony. As for the invoices submitted to Unick by HHM, the documents list various\nactions performed at HHM, such as \"Telephone conference with Mr. McGee, Re:\nBankruptcy, Etc.,\" as well as the date of the action and the initials of the responsible\nattorney. The documents have no indication of the time spent on each action, or of the\nrates charged by the attorneys at HHM.\n       {¶36} Although Loepp opined that the fees charged by HHM were reasonable, he\nadmitted during his testimony that Unick's documentary evidence of HHM's fees had no\nindication of hours worked or rates charged. Loepp agreed that it was not possible to\nsurmise HHM's billing rates, or to deduce how many hours had been spent on Unick's\nmatters. Loepp noted that it was surprising that so much time was spent litigating this\ncase, given that it seemed to be a simple breach of contract action. Loepp's comment on\nthis point indicates that the overall amount of work performed by HHM was excessive\ncompared to what was necessary under typical circumstances, irrespective of the\nreasonableness of the charge for each particular task. Finally, Leopp admitted that he did\nnot know if any of the charges listed by HHM had already been compensated in other\nproceedings.\n       {¶37} The billing records provided for HHM reveal that Unick was attempting to\nrecover attorney fees for the firm's work on the contract case at issue, and also for the\nbankruptcy case, the malpractice case, the fees already awarded pursuant to the\nsanctions motion, and the fees denied under the sanctions motion. The trial court\nexplicitly found that the bankruptcy and the malpractice litigation were not contemplated\nby the parties as damages for a breach of contract. The billing statements also relate to\nthe legal fees accrued in Unick's action against Kovachik in his individual capacity.\n\f                                                                                       - 12 -\n\n\nBecause Unick was not the prevailing party against Kovachik, his attorney fees are not\nrecoverable. Because Unick did not segregate the attorney fees that were actually\napplicable to the present proceedings, the credibility of the HHM billing statements is\nexceedingly, if not completely, undermined.\n       {¶38} Unick did not meet its initial burden of proving hours worked and hourly fee.\nThis alone prevented the trial court from being able to determine an award of attorney\nfees. Had the trial court merely guessed at the amount worked or the hourly fee charged\nby HHM or Eicher, there would be no \"objective basis\" from which the trial court might\nproceed to consider other factors, and it would not be possible for this court to conduct a\nmeaningful review.\n       {¶39} Unick argues that he did meet his burden of proof, despite his lack of\nattorney time records, because he was not obligated to prove the number of hours\nworked by his attorneys. In support, Unick relies on In Re: Estate of Wood (1977), 55\nOhio App.2d 67, 9 O.O.3d 225, 379 N.E.2d 256. In Wood, the party requesting attorney\nfees presented testimony regarding the attorney's hourly rates, the reasonableness of the\ncharges, and an estimation by an expert that the attorney had spent somewhere between\n400 and 500 hours on the Wood's estate, but no actual record of the amount of time the\nattorney had worked on the matter. Id. at 68-70. The Tenth District held that time\nrecords are \"not absolutely mandatory in making a determination of fees[.]\" Id. at 71.\n       {¶40} Wood does provide that there are some rare cases wherein the\ndetermination of reasonable time spent by an attorney does not require proof of hours\nworked. However, this notion simply does not support Unick's inverse argument that a\ntrial court abuses its discretion by declining to award attorney's fees when the litigant has\nfailed to prove the number of hours worked by his attorney. Moreover, the amount of\nevidence missing in the case at hand far surpasses the evidence that was missing in\nWood. Here, not only did Unick fail to provide any time records, he failed to provide any\nestimation of the amount or reasonableness of time spent by his attorneys, he failed to\nprove the rate of the attorneys' charges, and he failed to demonstrate which of the\ncharges in HHM's billing were actually applicable to the breach of contract action.\n\f                                                                                       - 13 -\n\n\n       {¶41} Unick's failure to provide evidence of actual time expended was only one of\nmany reasons that the trial court decided not to award attorney fees. Unick's argument\non this point is not well-taken.\n       {¶42} Additionally, Unick argues that the trial court's denial of attorney fees was an\nabuse of discretion because it disregarded Unick's clear right to attorney fees pursuant to\nhis contract with Pro-Cision. It is true that the contract between the parties allowed the\ntrial court to award attorney fees to the prevailing party in the event of a legal dispute.\nSee McConnell, supra, at 699. However, Unick still had the burden of proving the\nreasonableness of the fees. Stonehenge at ¶45. Because Unick failed to meet his\nburden, he had no right to collect attorney's fees under the contract.\n       {¶43} Unick further argues that he adequately proved his attorney fees because\nPro-Cision did not contest the reasonableness of Unick's attorney fees, and provided no\nevidence to demonstrate that the attorney fees were unreasonable. Contrary to Unick's\nclaim, the record reflects that Pro-Cision did in fact contest Unick's request for attorney's\nfees. Further, Unick bore the burden of first proving the reasonableness of his fees, thus\nhis failure to meet his burden rendered Pro-Cision's lack of evidence immaterial.\n       {¶44} Finally, Unick argues that this court should analogize the law of the case\ndoctrine to his proceedings, and conclude that the trial court's decision to award some\nattorney fees for Civ.R. 37 sanctions obligated the trial court to similarly award attorney\nfees related to the breach of contract decision. Pursuant to the law-of-the-case doctrine,\nan inferior court must act in accordance with the ruling of a reviewing court when\nconducting subsequent proceedings on the same matter. Nolan v. Nolan (1984), 11 Ohio\nSt.3d 1, 3, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d 410. This doctrine is completely inapplicable to the\ncase at hand. Unick is merely arguing that the incongruity between the sanctions award\nand the final award decision indicates that the trial court's decision was arbitrary, and\ntherefore an abuse of discretion. Moreover, the record does not contain the information\nrequired to review the reasoning behind the trial court's sanctions decision, such as a\ntranscript or the evidence submitted at the sanctions hearing. A comparison between the\ntrial court's two actions is not possible.\n\f                                                                                   - 14 -\n\n\n       {¶45} Given the foregoing, Unick did not meet his burden of proving reasonable\nattorney's fees associated with his action on breach of contract, and his arguments\nregarding the evidence submitted and the reasoning of the trial court are not well-taken.\nUnick's sole assignment of error is therefore meritless. Accordingly, the decision of the\ntrial court is affirmed.\nDonofrio, J., concurs.\nVukovich, J., concurs.\n\f",

Unick did not present competent credible\nevidence of reasonable attorney fees, and therefore did not meet his burden of proof.\nAccordingly, the trial court's denial of Unick's attorney fees is affirmed.\n                             Facts and Procedural History\n       {¶4}   During the spring of 1999, Unick and Kovachik jointly formed Pro-Cision,\nInc. They each invested $25,000.00 in the company, and each had a 50% ownership\ninterest. In order to obtain lines of credit for the company, both Kovachik and Unick\npledged personal assets as collateral. Unick pledged much more than Kovachick,\nincluding his tools and power equipment, his home, and two vehicles. Pursuant to the\nterms of the parties' corporation agreement, each owner had the right of first refusal to\nthe other owner's stock ownership in the event of a buy-out.\n       {¶5}   Soon after forming the company, Unick's son became ill and Unick needed\nto liquidate his stock in the company in order to raise money to care for his son.\nSubsequent to negotiations between the two parties, they entered a Stock Sale\nAgreement on February 7, 2000, wherein Unick was identified as the seller and Pro-\nCision as the purchaser. The agreement required Pro-Cision to pay $15,000 for Unick's\nstock in monthly installments of $275, with a final lump sum payment of $8,400. The\n\f                                                                                         -3-\n\n\nagreement states that Pro-Cision had effected the removal of Unick's name from certain\ncorporate obligations, including a loan from Second National Bank. However, the\nagreement notes that Pro-Cision had been unable to remove Unick's name from an\nobligation to National Machine Tool Financial Corporation, and thus Kovachick personally\njoined Pro-Cision to indemnify Unick from that particular obgligation.\n       {¶6}   The agreement further states that Pro-Cision will indemnify Unick and hold\nhim harmless \"from all loss, cost, damage, or expense, including reasonable attorneys'\nfees arising from\" all liabilities of Pro-Cision and any taxes owed, as well as any\n\"misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or default in any obligation on the part of [Pro-\nCision] under this agreement.\" Finally, the agreement designates responsibility for\nlitigation expenses as follows: \"In the event of a default under this agreement, the\ndefaulting party shall reimburse the nondefaulting party or parties for all costs and\nexpenses reasonably incurred by the nondefaulting party or parties in connection with the\ndefault, including without limitation attorney's fees. Additionally, in the event a suit or\naction is filed to enforce this agreement, the prevailing party or parties shall be\nreimbursed by the other party for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the\nsuit or action, including without limitation, reasonabe attorney's fees at the trial level and\non appeal.\"\n       {¶7}   Pro-Cision initially made a few installment payments per the agreement, but\nquickly ceased paying as required by the agreement. Additionally, the removal of Unick's\nname from the Second National Bank loan did not occur. Despite numerous requests,\nSecond National Bank refused to release Unick as a guarantor, due to Pro-Cision's poor\nfinancial condition.    Unick stated that he discovered the loan issue when he\nunsuccessfully sought to refinance his house, around April of 2000.\n       {¶8}   Unick retained Harrington Hoppe & Mitchell (\"HHM\") to determine his rights\nand potential actions regarding the Stock Sale Agreement. Unick incurred $32,251.72 in\nfees from HHM's services from 2001 to 2008. On April 17, 2002, Unick filed for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy, primarily using the services of another attorney who specialized in bankruptcy\nproceedings, incurring $1,000 in attorney's fees.\n\f                                                                                      -4-\n\n\n       {¶9}   Unick's attorney at the time of the Stock Sale Agreement had represented to\nUnick that he had been released as guarantor of the Second National Bank loan, and\nUnick relied on that statement when executing the agreement. Unick filed a malpractice\nsuit against his original attorney on September 10, 2002, primarily using the services of\nSemple and Eicher throughout the malpractice proceedings. Unick obtained a judgment\nfor $250,000 on September 22, 2004 but settled for a reduced amount of $200,000 due\nto the malpractice insurance coverage limits. The judgment award was deposited into\nUnick's bankruptcy trust, and on March 21, 2005, the bankruptcy court authorized the\ntrustee to pay Eicher $61,201.80 for legal fees and expenses owed by Unick related to\nthe malpractice action.\n       {¶10} On April 13, 2005, represented by HHM, Unick filed a complaint against\nPro-Cision, and against Kovachik individually, claiming breach of contract, promissory\nestoppel, misrepresentation, fraud in the inducement, and anticipatory repudiation.\nDuring the discovery process, Unick filed a Civ.R. 37 motion for sanctions against Pro-\nCision for its failure to comply with court orders for discovery, and requested $1950.50 in\nattorney's fees. The trial court granted the motion on May 17, 2006, but summarily\nconcluded that the reasonable attorney's fees associated with the motion were $450.00.\n       {¶11} On February 28, 2007, Unick filed a Partial Motion for Summary Judgment,\nsolely addressing the breach of contract claim. Unick demanded $9,175.00, which was\nthe amount still due under the parties' repayment clause of the Stock Sale Agreement.\nUnick also demanded $216,720.68 for all losses accrued as a result of Pro-Cision's and\nKovachik's failure to indemnify Unick from the Second National Bank loan, including,\namong other things, all legal expenses during the bankruptcy, malpractice, and breach of\ncontract proceedings up to the present date. According to the docket, on March 21,\n2007, Pro-Cision filed a motion contra summary judgment, and a motion to strike the\nsupporting affidavit from Unick's motion, but both of these motions are missing from the\nrecord.\n       {¶12} On June 22, 2007, the magistrate concluded that Pro-Cision and Kovachik\nhad breached both the payment portion and the indemnification portion of the parties'\n\f                                                                                      -5-\n\n\nagreement. The magistrate concluded that the terms of the agreement obligated Pro-\nCision to pay all damages \"in connection with the default,\" including incidental and\nconsequential damages flowing from the breach.          The magistrate also found that\nKovachik assumed individual liability for the failure to release Unick from the Second\nNational Bank loan. The decision deferred ruling on damages until a later hearing.\n       {¶13} On October 16, 2007, upon consideration of the objections filed by Pro-\nCision and Kovachik, the trial court found that the magistrate erred in determining that\nKovachik had agreed to be held individually accountable for failure to remove Unick's\nname from the Second National Bank loan. The trial court remanded the magistrate's\ndecision with instructions to rule on Pro-Cision's motion to strike and any remaining\nissues.\n       {¶14} On May 13, 2008, upon remand, the magistrate overruled Unick's summary\njudgment motion as against Kovachik, because he was not identified in the agreement as\nthe purchaser, and was only individually identified as a responsible party regarding a\nseparate loan that was not at issue in the case. The magistrate granted Pro-Cision's\nmotion to strike, finding that Unick's affidavit and all other documents regarding specific\ndamages lacked the requisite foundation, and that no evidence was submitted to\nestablish the reasonableness of the claimed attorney fees. The magistrate noted that\nUnick had already received a malpractice verdict and settlement in the amount of\n$200,000 from his former attorney. The magistrate partially sustained Unick's motion\nagainst Pro-Cision for breach of contract, and the damages claim of $9,170.00. The\nmagistrate found that material facts still remained regarding all other issues. On July 22,\n2008, the trial court overruled Unick's objections, and adopted the magistrate's decision.\n       {¶15} In September of 2008, HHM withdrew as counsel, and Eicher filed an entry\nof appearance as counsel for Unick. Unick continued his litigation against Kovachik\nindividually and against Pro-Cision for claims beyond the $9,170 awarded in summary\njudgment, including the claims of promissory estoppel, misrepresentation, fraud in the\ninducement, breach of contract and anticipatory breach. The matter proceeded to trial on\nJanuary 13, 2009.\n\f                                                                                      -6-\n\n\n       {¶16} One of the main issues at trial was the amount of reasonable attorney's fees\nto be awarded as a result of Pro-Cision's breach. Unick argued that but for the fact that\nhe was not released from the Second National Bank debt as contractually provided, he\nwould not have entered into bankruptcy. He argued that all of HHM's fees, all of the fees\naccumulated from the bankruptcy proceedings, and all of the fees of his present attorney\nwere therefore chargeable to Pro-Cision.\n       {¶17} Attorney Donald Loepp was presented by Unick as an expert qualified to\ntestify regarding legal fees. Loepp provided his opinion over Pro-Cision's objection, as\nLoepp had not submitted a report. Loepp described the claimed fees listed in Plaintiff's\nExhibit 4, including $32,251.72 for HHM's service from 2001 to 2008 in various\nproceedings, $1,000.00 for bankruptcy counsel's services, $75,098.88 for Eicher's service\nin the malpractice proceedings, and a flat fee of $15,000.00 for Eicher's service in the\npresent action, starting in August of 2008. Loepp opined that all of the charges in Exhibit\n4 were commensurate with the work that was required and performed.\n       {¶18} Loepp testified that HHM's fees were primarily related to the contract action.\nLoepp noted that the docket indicated that the case has been extremely litigious, and\nopined that HHM would therefore need to perform the extensive services listed, and that\nthe fees charged were reasonable. Loepp guessed that HHM's fees were akin to flat rate\ncharges for each task, and opined that the fees charged for the tasks shown were\nreasonable fees within the legal community. Loepp identified Eicher's $15,000.00 fee as\nrelating to the present proceedings, but offered no further opinion regarding the fee.\n       {¶19} Loepp conceded that the HHM billing had no indication of hours worked or\nof the hourly billing rate for any of their fees. Loepp further agreed that it was not\npossible to surmise HHM's billing rates, or to deduce how many hours had been spent on\nUnick's matters. Loepp admitted that he was aware of the sanctions granted earlier in the\nproceedings, but did not review whether HHM's requested attorney's fees for those\nsanctions were included a second time in the billing in Exhibit 4. Loepp also noted that\nEicher represented Unick in the malpractice action on a contingency basis, and that the\nbankruptcy court had determined and paid that fee out of the $200,000.00 settlement.\n\f                                                                                     -7-\n\n\n       {¶20} On June 3, 2009, the magistrate determined that all of Unick's claims, apart\nfrom Pro-Cision's breach of the Stock Sale Agreement, were meritless. The magistrate\nfound that the fees associated with Unick's bankruptcy and malpractice proceedings were\nnot contemplated in the Stock Sale Agreement. Regarding the remaining fees from HHM\nand Eicher, the magistrate found that there was \"no evidence of time spent or an hourly\nrate for any of the claimed services and it is apparent that the services were in part\nblended with and in some instances directed primarily towards plaintiff's malpractice\nlitigation and bankruptcy.\"\n       {¶21} The magistrate noted that, despite being given full opportunity to present\nadequate evidence to prove the reasonableness of the attorney's fees, Unick left the\nmagistrate \"only able to speculate or surmise how much time was involved for related\nservices, which based upon the nature of the presentation of the evidence, would be\nnecessarily [sic] to extrapolate the rate of charge for the services presented by the\ninvoices.\" The magistrate reaffirmed that Pro-Cision was liable for breach of contract,\nand recommended that judgment be entered in Unick's favor only in the amount of\n$9170.00, plus interest.\n       {¶22} On September 10, 2009, the trial court affirmed the magistrate's decision,\nand Unick filed a timely notice of appeal.\n                              Reasonable Attorney's Fees\n       {¶23} In Unick's sole assignment of error, he asserts:\n       {¶24} \"The trial court committed reversible error in holding the party who is\npursuing payment of attorney's fees pursuant to a written contract must provide evidence\nof actual time expended by the attorney or the actual rate charged by the attorney for\nclaimed fees.\"\n       {¶25} Pursuant to the \"American Rule,\" each party in a lawsuit must generally\nbear its own attorney fees.

The attorney's hourly rate for services,\nas well as the reasonableness of the rate, had been established. Id. at *4. However, the\nprevailing party submitted billing statements that only listed the specific activities of the\nattorney and the total number of hours expended, but did not list the amount of time spent\n\f                                                                                        - 10 -\n\n\nfor each activity. Id. The Eleventh District found that the appellee had presented\ninsufficient evidence to allow a reviewable determination of reasonable attorney fees. Id.\n       {¶32} In Stonehenge, a jury awarded $100,000.00 in attorney's fees to\nStonehenge, which the trial court subsequently reversed pursuant to a Civ.R. 50(B)\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict. Stonehenge at ¶17. At trial, Stonehenge had\npresented evidence as to the reasonableness of the attorney fees solely through the\ntestimony of the company's owner. Id. at ¶44. The owner testified that the total attorney\nfees charged to the company were reasonable because they were comparable to the fee\nestimates that other attorneys had provided for his action. Id. at ¶47. The hourly rates\nhad apparently been provided in certain attorney invoices, but the owner was not able to\ntestify \"whether the hourly rates charged are typical for the market, which hourly rates\nwere charged to Stonehenge, exactly who had worked on the case, or how much\nStonehenge had actually been charged. He did not personally review Stonehenge's\nattorney invoices.\" Id. The reviewing court concluded that the evidence presented was\nnot sufficient for a determination of reasonable attorney fees, and upheld the trial court's\ndecision to deny attorney fees. Id.\n       {¶33} Thus, a complaining party bears the burden of initially proving the number of\nhours an attorney spent on his case, the hourly rate that the attorney charges, and the\nreasonableness of that hourly rate, after which point the trial court may exercise its\ndiscretion to modify the amount pursuant to the factors described in Prof. Cond. R. 1.5.\nPursuant to the application of this rule in Pracker and Stonhenge, when a prevailing party\ndoes not present sufficient evidence to support a request for attorney's fees, the trial court\nhas the discretion to deny the request in its entirety.\n       {¶34} Unick presents a number of arguments in his attempt to demonstrate that\nhe met his burden of proof and that he should have been awarded attorney's fees. He\nargues that he was not obligated to prove the number of hours worked by his attorneys,\nthat the trial court's prior award of attorney fees during a sanctions hearing became the\n\"law of the case\" regarding the reasonableness of fees, that he had the contractual right\n\f                                                                                    - 11 -\n\n\nto collect attorney fees, and that Pro-Cision failed to prove that Unick's requested fees\nwere unreasonable.\n       {¶35} In support of his claim for attorney's fees, Unick presented the testimony of\nLoepp and presented a compendium of legal fees charged by Eicher and HHM as an\nexhibit. The flat fee of $15,000.00 charged by Eicher did not include any explanation of\nhours worked or rates charged, and no further clarification was provided in Loepp's\ntestimony. As for the invoices submitted to Unick by HHM, the documents list various\nactions performed at HHM, such as \"Telephone conference with Mr. McGee, Re:\nBankruptcy, Etc.,\" as well as the date of the action and the initials of the responsible\nattorney. The documents have no indication of the time spent on each action, or of the\nrates charged by the attorneys at HHM.\n       {¶36} Although Loepp opined that the fees charged by HHM were reasonable, he\nadmitted during his testimony that Unick's documentary evidence of HHM's fees had no\nindication of hours worked or rates charged. Loepp agreed that it was not possible to\nsurmise HHM's billing rates, or to deduce how many hours had been spent on Unick's\nmatters. Loepp noted that it was surprising that so much time was spent litigating this\ncase, given that it seemed to be a simple breach of contract action. Loepp's comment on\nthis point indicates that the overall amount of work performed by HHM was excessive\ncompared to what was necessary under typical circumstances, irrespective of the\nreasonableness of the charge for each particular task. Finally, Leopp admitted that he did\nnot know if any of the charges listed by HHM had already been compensated in other\nproceedings.\n       {¶37} The billing records provided for HHM reveal that Unick was attempting to\nrecover attorney fees for the firm's work on the contract case at issue, and also for the\nbankruptcy case, the malpractice case, the fees already awarded pursuant to the\nsanctions motion, and the fees denied under the sanctions motion. The trial court\nexplicitly found that the bankruptcy and the malpractice litigation were not contemplated\nby the parties as damages for a breach of contract. The billing statements also relate to\nthe legal fees accrued in Unick's action against Kovachik in his individual capacity.\n\f                                                                                       - 12 -\n\n\nBecause Unick was not the prevailing party against Kovachik, his attorney fees are not\nrecoverable. Because Unick did not segregate the attorney fees that were actually\napplicable to the present proceedings, the credibility of the HHM billing statements is\nexceedingly, if not completely, undermined.\n       {¶38} Unick did not meet its initial burden of proving hours worked and hourly fee.\nThis alone prevented the trial court from being able to determine an award of attorney\nfees. Had the trial court merely guessed at the amount worked or the hourly fee charged\nby HHM or Eicher, there would be no \"objective basis\" from which the trial court might\nproceed to consider other factors, and it would not be possible for this court to conduct a\nmeaningful review.\n       {¶39} Unick argues that he did meet his burden of proof, despite his lack of\nattorney time records, because he was not obligated to prove the number of hours\nworked by his attorneys. In support, Unick relies on In Re: Estate of Wood (1977), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3775560\"><a href=\"/opinion/4019702/in-re-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 O.O.3d 225, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3775560\"><a href=\"/opinion/4019702/in-re-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In Wood, the party requesting attorney\nfees presented testimony regarding the attorney's hourly rates, the reasonableness of the\ncharges, and an estimation by an expert that the attorney had spent somewhere between\n400 and 500 hours on the Wood's estate, but no actual record of the amount of time the\nattorney had worked on the matter. Id. at 68-70. The Tenth District held that time\nrecords are \"not absolutely mandatory in making a determination of fees[.]\" Id. at 71.\n       {¶40} Wood does provide that there are some rare cases wherein the\ndetermination of reasonable time spent by an attorney does not require proof of hours\nworked. However, this notion simply does not support Unick's inverse argument that a\ntrial court abuses its discretion by declining to award attorney's fees when the litigant has\nfailed to prove the number of hours worked by his attorney. Moreover, the amount of\nevidence missing in the case at hand far surpasses the evidence that was missing in\nWood. Here, not only did Unick fail to provide any time records, he failed to provide any\nestimation of the amount or reasonableness of time spent by his attorneys, he failed to\nprove the rate of the attorneys' charges, and he failed to demonstrate which of the\ncharges in HHM's billing were actually applicable to the breach of contract action.\n\f                                                                                       - 13 -\n\n\n       {¶41} Unick's failure to provide evidence of actual time expended was only one of\nmany reasons that the trial court decided not to award attorney fees. Unick's argument\non this point is not well-taken.\n       {¶42} Additionally, Unick argues that the trial court's denial of attorney fees was an\nabuse of discretion because it disregarded Unick's clear right to attorney fees pursuant to\nhis contract with Pro-Cision. It is true that the contract between the parties allowed the\ntrial court to award attorney fees to the prevailing party in the event of a legal dispute.\nSee McConnell, supra, at 699. However, Unick still had the burden of proving the\nreasonableness of the fees. Stonehenge at ¶45. Because Unick failed to meet his\nburden, he had no right to collect attorney's fees under the contract.\n       {¶43} Unick further argues that he adequately proved his attorney fees because\nPro-Cision did not contest the reasonableness of Unick's attorney fees, and provided no\nevidence to demonstrate that the attorney fees were unreasonable. Contrary to Unick's\nclaim, the record reflects that Pro-Cision did in fact contest Unick's request for attorney's\nfees. Further, Unick bore the burden of first proving the reasonableness of his fees, thus\nhis failure to meet his burden rendered Pro-Cision's lack of evidence immaterial.\n       {¶44} Finally, Unick argues that this court should analogize the law of the case\ndoctrine to his proceedings, and conclude that the trial court's decision to award some\nattorney fees for Civ.R. 37 sanctions obligated the trial court to similarly award attorney\nfees related to the breach of contract decision. Pursuant to the law-of-the-case doctrine,\nan inferior court must act in accordance with the ruling of a reviewing court when\nconducting subsequent proceedings on the same matter. Nolan v. Nolan (1984), 11 Ohio\nSt.3d 1, 3, 11 OBR 1, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. This doctrine is completely inapplicable to the\ncase at hand. Unick is merely arguing that the incongruity between the sanctions award\nand the final award decision indicates that the trial court's decision was arbitrary, and\ntherefore an abuse of discretion. Moreover, the record does not contain the information\nrequired to review the reasoning behind the trial court's sanctions decision, such as a\ntranscript or the evidence submitted at the sanctions hearing. A comparison between the\ntrial court's two actions is not possible.\n\f                                                                                   - 14 -\n\n\n       {¶45} Given the foregoing, Unick did not meet his burden of proving reasonable\nattorney's fees associated with his action on breach of contract, and his arguments\nregarding the evidence submitted and the reasoning of the trial court are not well-taken.\nUnick's sole assignment of error is therefore meritless. Accordingly, the decision of the\ntrial court is affirmed.\nDonofrio, J., concurs.\nVukovich, J., concurs.\n\f</pre>",
