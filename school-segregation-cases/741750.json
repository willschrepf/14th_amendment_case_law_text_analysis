The challenged policy permits race and gender, in addition to other factors, to be taken into account under special circumstances during an admissions lottery. Defendants to the action comprise PUSD, individual members of the PUSD's Board of Education (the \"Board\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and PUSD Superintendent, Vera Vignes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellees allege that PUSD's use of race as an admissions factor violated both the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, &#167; 31 of the California Constitution. In addition, plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to damages under California Civil Code &#167; 52 (the \"Unruh Act\"). PUSD now appeals the district court's order granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs' federal and state constitutional claims and denying PUSD's cross-motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the plaintiffs lack Article III standing. Plaintiffs cross-appeal the district court's dismissal of their state law damages claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the order of the district court granting summary judgment for the plaintiffs and dismiss all of plaintiffs' claims for failure to establish Article III standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Factual Summary</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case concerns PUSD's use of weighted lotteries in its magnet school admissions process in an effort to improve the fairness of voluntary pupil assignments and to maintain student body diversity, without sacrificing eligibility for state and federal desegregation funding. In January 1970, PUSD received the dubious distinction of being the first non-Southern school district to be placed under a consent decree by a federal district court in order to remedy <i>de jure</i> racial segregation within its public school system. <i>Spangler v. Pasadena City Bd. of Educ.,</i> 311 F.Supp. 501 (C.D.Cal.1970). The court's injunction resulted in a radical restructuring of school attendance zones throughout the city, known as the Pasadena Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The injunction lasted for nine years until PUSD was declared unitary and released from judicial supervision by order of this court. 611 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir.1979). We overruled the district court's exercise of its equitable discretion to maintain jurisdiction over the District's integration plan based in part upon the Board's \"representations that it would continue to engage in affirmative action in the future in support of integration.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1241. As a result, PUSD formed its first voluntary integration plan in 1980, updating the plan twice in the 1990s to respond to demographic shifts in the district's population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with its goal of providing an integrated public education environment, PUSD currently operates three magnet, or voluntary, schools: Don Benito Fundamental School (\"Don Benito\") including students in grades kindergarten through five, Norma Coombs Alternative School (\"Norma Coombs\") including students in grades kindergarten through eight, and Marshall Fundamental School (\"Marshall\") including students in grades six through twelve. Although every PUSD student is assigned to a neighborhood school, a student may also apply voluntarily to one or more of the voluntary schools, so long as the individual school's curriculum covers the student's present grade. The opportunity for superior academic performance and special resources make admission to the voluntary schools desirable for students who are willing to forgo the convenience of attending neighborhood schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 24, 1998, the Board approved its Integration Policy and Quality Schooling Plan, thereby amending Board Policy 0460.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> According to the policy, the Board instituted a lottery system for assigning students to the voluntary schools, to be used only if a school received more applications than it had available spaces.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The Board amended its voluntary admissions procedures in response to complaints from parents who were previously required to wait in line in order to secure a place for their children on a \"first come, first served\" basis. When the number of students applying for admission to any particular voluntary school exceeded the number of available spaces, the policy first gave priority to siblings of students already enrolled at the school. If spaces remained available after siblings had been admitted, any remaining unassigned students were to be chosen through a computerized lottery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the Board determined that a lottery was appropriate with regard to any particular school, the policy would permit PUSD to weigh gender, race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, language, and special needs as factors within the lottery process for admission to that school. According to the policy, these factors could only be considered \"when necessary to create an integrated setting.\" Board Policy 0460(d) &#182; 8. The use of these factors was further restricted to the selection of students for the entering grades of each voluntary school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parents were informed of the amended policy by a letter from Superintendent Vignes, dated November 30, 1998. The amended policy was to go into effect beginning with applications submitted in the spring of 1999 for the 1999-2000 school year. The Board provided a three-month window for the submission of applications, opening on January 4, 1999, and closing on March 12, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1999, before the revised admissions policy had been implemented at any voluntary school, Vignes presented a report to the Legislative Council of the California Legislature, documenting the use of state-provided, voluntary desegregation funding by PUSD. The report was required by state law governing the use of desegregation funding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In order to maintain eligibility for state voluntary desegregation funding, PUSD was required to demonstrate how programs receiving funding worked both to alleviate the harmful effects of racial segregation and to improve student academic performance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her report, Vignes recounted the District's history of judicial supervision and proclaimed the District's continuing obligation to integrate its public schools. In addition, Vignes presented statistical showings that PUSD's voluntary schools, as well as other schools receiving desegregation funding to support their student transportation programs, consistently out-performed schools that based their enrollment strictly on neighborhood attendance zones. Finally, Vignes represented the lottery system for voluntary school admission as a new amendment to PUSD's longstanding integration policy, furthering the District's effort to comply with state funding requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 1999, PUSD conducted lotteries for two of the three voluntary schools, Don Benito and Norma Coombs. Marshall High School, which did not run a deficit of available spaces in 1999, admitted all student applicants without resorting to a lottery. The two minor plaintiffs (Kalya Hunter and Michaela Reyes) who applied to Marshall were admitted for the 1999-2000 school year. In addition, three plaintiffs (Jocelyne Alva, Ronald Rucker, and Detrick Standmore) did not apply to any voluntary school for the 1999-2000 academic cycle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No minor plaintiff applying to either Norma Coombs or Don Benito was subjected to a lottery process that used race, ethnicity, gender or any other student characteristic as a factor because the applicant pools were determined to be broadly representative of the District's overall student population.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Two minor plaintiffs (Camden Ren&#233; Amy and Marissa Laraine Amy) applied to Norma Coombs, but they simultaneously informed PUSD that they intended to attend Woodrow Wilson Middle School if that school was able to assemble its International Baccalaureate Program. Because the aforementioned program was established for the 1999-2000 school year, their applications were withdrawn from Norma Coombs. Finally, the remaining minor plaintiff (George MacPherson) applied to Don Benito, was included in the lottery process held in April 1999, and was not selected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Procedural History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scott filed the first amended complaint in this case on March 29, 1999. PUSD responded with a motion to dismiss, arguing that Scott lacked standing to challenge the lottery process. The district court denied that motion, concluding that dismissal based on lack of standing was premature, but providing the defendants leave to pursue the issue at summary judgment. In August 1999, the parties entered an agreement to take limited discovery prior to summary judgment, providing for a second discovery phase if summary judgment was not dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 7, 1999, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, again alleging that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing. Scott filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on all claims, except the damages claim under the Unruh Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the defendants' motion, holding that the revised lottery provisions of the policy constituted a denial of equal treatment sufficient to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement for Article III standing. The court further held that \"whether or not Plaintiffs actually suffered racial discrimination is immaterial\" because the plaintiffs were \"ready and able\" to apply to the voluntary schools in the future and \"a discriminatory policy prevented [them] from doing so on an equal basis.\" Mem. Order (Feb. 7, 2000) at 12. The court concluded that \"[t]he language of BP 0460(d)(8), render[ed] untenable Defendants' position that places were assigned in a race-, ethnic-, or gender-neutral manner,\" because, in order to determine whether an adjustment of the random lottery process is necessary to promote integration, the Board must \"always keep[] an eye on the applicant pool to make sure it is a fair representation of the PUSD's racial, ethnic or gender makeup as a whole.\" <i>Id.</i> at 15. The defendants currently appeal the district court's denial of their motion for summary judgment as well as its grant of summary judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the court issued an injunction against future enforcement of BP 0460(d) &#182; 8 to the extent that it considered race, ethnicity, or gender, it did not invalidate the results of the 1999 admissions process. Following the court's filing of its order on February 7, 2000, PUSD suspended enforcement of the policy. PUSD took this action before making any pupil assignments for the 2000-2001 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 20, 2000, the district court issued an order <i>sua sponte</i> dismissing Scott's claims for damages under the Unruh Act for failure to state a claim. Scott currently appeals the district court's dismissal of the state law damages claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's order granting summary judgment <i>de novo. See Clicks Billiards Inc. v. Sixshooters, Inc.,</i> 251 F.3d 1252 (9th Cir.2001); <i>Robi v. Reed,</i> 173 F.3d 736, 739 (9th Cir.1999). Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). In reviewing summary judgment, we \"must determine whether the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the law.\" <i>Warren v. City of Carlsbad,</i> 58 F.3d 439, 441 (9th Cir.1995), <i>cert. denied,</i> 516 U.S. 1171, 116 S.Ct. 1261, 134 L.Ed.2d 209 (1996); <i>see also Pomerantz v. County of Los Angeles,</i> 674 F.2d 1288, 1290 (9th Cir. 1982) (holding that the same standard applies for review of denial of summary judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because \"[a] district court's decision to grant a permanent injunction involves factual, legal, and discretionary components,\" we evaluate such a decision under three different standards of review. <i>Walters v. Reno,</i> 145 F.3d 1032, 1047 (9th Cir.1998). We review the district court's legal conclusions <i>de novo. Id.</i> Any factual findings supporting the decision to grant the injunction will be reviewed for clear error. <i>Id.</i> We review the scope of the injunction for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> However, the district court may not rely on factual findings made incident to the issuance of a permanent injunction when deciding a motion for summary judgment. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 52(a) (stating that findings of fact are unnecessary on decisions of motions under Rule 56); <i>Rand v. Rowland,</i> 154 F.3d 952, 957 n. 4 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc) (stating that \"[a] district court does not, of course, make `findings of fact' in ruling on a summary judgment motion\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <i>Bothke v. Fluor Eng'rs &amp; Constructors, Inc.,</i> 834 F.2d 804, 810 (9th Cir.1987) (stating that the \"district court was not entitled to make findings of fact\" at summary judgment and holding, therefore, that a prior panel in the same case \"erred in applying the `clearly erroneous' test of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)\"); <i>see also Country Floors v. P'Ship of Gepner &amp; Ford,</i> 930 F.2d 1056, 1062 (3d Cir.1991) (holding that factual determinations made in ruling on a motion for a preliminary injunction cannot be used to decide summary judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Scott had standing to bring a federal equal protection challenge against the District's voluntary school admissions policy. The court then ruled that the policy's authorization of the use of race, as an admissions factor in certain circumstances, violated the test of strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &#167; 1; <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,</i> 515 U.S. 200, 227, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995) (holding that \"all racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor ... are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests\"), and similarly violated state constitutional law, Cal. Const. art. I, &#167; 31. The court also ruled that the policy's authorization of the use of gender as an admissions factor violated equal protection, by failing to satisfy the test of intermediate scrutiny, <i>Craig v. Boren,</i> 429 U.S. 190, 197, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976) (holding that gender classifications \"must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to those objectives\"), and similarly violated state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants continue to challenge standing on appeal. We conclude that the mere existence of the admissions policy, standing alone, is insufficient to satisfy the requirement of Article III standing and that, therefore, we lack jurisdiction over Scott's state and federal claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Article III Standing</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must establish jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> \"Every federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review, even though the parties are prepared to concede it. And if the record discloses that the lower court was without jurisdiction this court will notice the defect, although the parties make no contention concerning it.\" <i>Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona,</i> 520 U.S. 43, 73, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <i>accord Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). The federal courts are \"courts of limited jurisdiction that have not been vested with unlimited open-ended lawmaking powers.\" <i>Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Trans. Workers,</i> 451 U.S. 77, 95, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981). Rather, our jurisdiction is circumscribed by the \"case or controversy\" requirement of Article III standing and by prudential considerations, such as ripeness,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> that arise as we navigate constitutional limitations on our judicial power. U.S. Const. art. III; <i>Abbott Labs. v. Gardner,</i> 387 U.S. 136, 148, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967); <i>see also Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm'n,</i> 220 F.3d 1134, 1138-42 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (discussing the constitutional and prudential elements of the standing and ripeness doctrines).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement of Article III standing is a core component of the separation of powers. <i>See Citizens for a Better Env't,</i> 523 U.S. at 101, 118 S.Ct. 1003; <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 559-60, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). The standing doctrine aids the federal judiciary to avoid intruding impermissibly upon the powers vested in the executive and legislative branches, by preventing courts from issuing advisory opinions not founded upon the facts of a controversy between truly adverse parties. <i>United Public Workers v. Mitchell,</i> 330 U.S. 75, 89-90, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish standing, a plaintiff must first show that she has suffered an \"`injury in fact' &#8212; an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\" <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Second, the injury must be \"fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). Third, \"it must be `likely,' as opposed to merely `speculative,'\" that the injury is remediable by appropriate court action. <i>Id.</i> at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an action challenging the constitutionality of racial and gender classifications,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> the defendant bears the ultimate burden of proving that the classifications satisfy strict and intermediate scrutiny respectively. <i>See Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U.S. 469, 505, 509-11, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (discussing strict scrutiny); <i>United States v.

However, before the burden shifts to the defendant to make such a showing, the plaintiff must first satisfy her burden of demonstrating that she has standing to make the constitutional challenge. <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U.S. at 210-11, 115 S.Ct. 2097.

Scott alleges that, insofar as PUSD continues to perform this monitoring function, it maintains an unconstitutional barrier to individual plaintiffs' admission to the voluntary schools. The district court agreed with this argument, but its ruling is anomalous. Although the district court found that PUSD \"assigned students to the voluntary schools in a race-neutral manner for the 1999/2000 school year,\" the court concluded that it was \"logically impossible\" for the lotteries to have been run in such a manner because PUSD was required to monitor the racial composition of each applicant pool in order to determine whether race should be applied as a corrective admissions factor.

The court failed to consider, for example, whether the putative harm of monitoring would attach even if the District were not authorized to perform a weighted lottery to compensate for imbalances.

First, the plaintiff must articulate a \"`concrete plan' to violate the law in question.\" 220 F.3d at 1139. Scott presented affidavits before the district court representing the intentions of individual plaintiffs to apply to PUSD voluntary schools during the earliest available application cycle. However, a pledge of general intent to place oneself within the purview of a challenged policy that fails to \"specify ... under what circumstances\" that policy might be enforced will \"not rise to the level of an articulated, concrete plan.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Thomas</i> panel ruled that \"[t]he landlords' expressed `intent' to violate the law on some uncertain day in the future &#8212; if and when an unmarried couple attempts to lease one of their rental properties &#8212; can hardly qualify as a concrete plan.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1140. Like the landlord plaintiffs in <i>Thomas,</i> Scott's professed intention to subject herself to a racial or gender weighted lottery is contingent upon an unpredictable set of societal factors that may or may not arise, and thereby trigger the implementation of a weighted lottery, when an individual plaintiff's application for admission to a voluntary school is made. At the next opportunity for a plaintiff to make an application, that student may be subjected to a weighted lottery, or no lottery may be conducted because no school is oversubscribed, or a lottery may be conducted at one or more schools but it may apply no weighted factor. Scott cannot base her plan to incur actual, constitutional injury upon this insurmountable contingency.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, a plaintiff may satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement by demonstrating that government officials \"have communicated a specific warning or threat\" of enforcement. <i>Id.</i> The <i>Thomas</i> panel reiterated that the threat of enforcement \"must at least be `credible,' not simply `imaginary or speculative.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Babbitt,</i> 442 U.S. at 298, 99 S.Ct. 2301). PUSD has given no indication that it intends to apply a weighted factor in any future lottery. That is, the District has not represented to parents that it expects any future applicant pool to be so grossly out of balance with the district-wide student population that the application of a corrective racial or gender factor is imminent. To the contrary, PUSD Superintendent Vignes has stated that race or ethnicity would be applied as an admissions factor only under \"compelling\" circumstances \"where [a] school was so racially identifiable that it was a segregated school or was fast moving in the direction of becoming a segregated school.\" Decl. of Vera Vignes (Jan. 24, 2000) &#182; 11. Vignes further qualified her assessment by stating that PUSD \"ha[s] not yet faced [such] a situation.\" <i>Id.</i> Scott offers no contravening evidence.

Thus, the fact that no individual plaintiff has yet been subjected to a race or gender discriminatory admissions qualification under the policy weakens Scott's claim of standing to seek prospective relief insofar as the lack of prior implementation of the policy leaves us without a basis upon which to infer that the threat to Scott is genuine. <i>See also Lyons,</i> 461 U.S. at 102, 103 S.Ct. 1660 (\"Past wrongs [are] evidence bearing on `whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.'\") (quoting <i>O'Shea,</i> 414 U.S. at 496, 94 S.Ct. 669).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>City of Los Angeles v.

The Court instructively described the difference between the injury requirement for standing to sue for damages and standing to obtain injunctive relief, stating \"[t]hat Lyons may have been illegally choked by the police ... while presumably affording Lyons standing to claim damages... does nothing to establish a real and immediate threat that he would again be stopped [for any offense], by an officer or officers who would illegally choke him.\" <i>Id.</i> at 105, 103 S.Ct. 1660.

The district court's ruling purports to determine that the plaintiffs had standing because they alleged that they faced a barrier in admissions; the court's ruling in fact permits the plaintiffs to bring suit without alleging that such a barrier was erected against them, but merely by alleging that it could be (at some unspecified time in the future, under some unspecified condition).

To what degree PUSD would resort to the use of non-suspect factors before suspect factors or would use targeted recruiting to obviate the need for a weighted lottery at all is a question vital to the resolution of the constitutional issues but unanswerable under the present posture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's ruling on Scott's equal protection claims abstracted this case from its proper factual context, and, as a result, it is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's instruction that strict scrutiny should not be \"fatal in fact.\" <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U.S. at 237, 115 S.Ct. 2097; <i>see also Croson,</i> 488 U.S. at 519, 109 S.Ct. 706 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\"[A] rule of automatic invalidity for racial preferences in almost every case would be a significant break with our precedents that require a case-by-case test.\"). Currently, we have no basis from which to infer how racial or gender criteria might correlate with other criteria, such as socioeconomic status and language, in PUSD's actual implementation of the challenged policy. For example, we know neither if the weighted lottery system will allow for PUSD to make significant racial adjustments in its student body by considering non-suspect criteria, either in tandem with or instead of racial criteria, nor if the district would give deference to non-suspect criteria in order to circumscribe its consideration of race to conform to the requirements of narrow tailoring.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> Moreover, even if the parties had engaged in a second discovery phase, it is unlikely that a sufficient factual basis for adjudication could have been laid relying upon the single academic cycle during which the challenged policy was in effect but did not result in the use of any weighted admissions factor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without knowing the conditions under which such a policy is to be implemented, no court can make a true determination as to whether the policy as practiced uses race in a way that is necessary to satisfy the compelling interest of student-body diversity. <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 313-17, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (opinion of Justice Powell) (describing the importance of diversity in education as \"substantial\"); <i>see also Smith,</i> 233 F.3d at 1201 (reaffirming that Justice Powell's <i>Bakke</i> opinion states the law of this circuit). In addition, we cannot infer whether in the future PUSD may apply race as a factor in its admissions process for a purpose that is appropriately remedial. <i>See Croson,</i> 488 U.S. at 509-10, 109 S.Ct. 706 (discussing the basis for appropriately remedial use of race-based classifications under the Equal Protection Clause).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our judicial review would \"stand on a much surer footing in the context of a specific application\" of the PUSD policy. <i>Toilet Goods,</i> 387 U.S. at 164, 87 S.Ct. 1520. Because Scott maintains that individual plaintiffs have applied and promise to continue to apply to PUSD voluntary schools despite the existence of the policy, and because an actual implementation of the challenged admissions criteria in the future will not ensure that the individual plaintiffs will not be admitted to the school of their choice, we find no hardship to Scott in declining to rule on the equal protection issue at this stage. As the Supreme Court stated when refusing to rule on the merits of Marco Defunis's moot discrimination claim, \"if the admissions procedures of the [school] remain unchanged, there is no reason to suppose that a subsequent case attacking those procedures will not come with relative speed to this Court.\" <i>DeFunis,</i> 416 U.S. at 319, 94 S.Ct. 1704.

By finding that Scott did not have standing to assert her federal equal protection claim, we have determined that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Thus, we have no discretion to retain supplemental jurisdiction over Scott's state law claims. <i>See Herman Family Revocable Trust v. Teddy Bear,</i> 254 F.3d 802, 806 (9th Cir.2001) (\"If the district court dismisses all federal claims on the merits, it has discretion under &#167; 1367(c) to adjudicate the remaining claims; if the court dismisses for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, it has no discretion and must dismiss all claims.\"); <i>see also Musson Theatrical, Inc. v.

Students were permitted to request transfers to other neighborhood schools and permits to attend voluntary schools.

Finally, the policy provided that:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">At sites where the number of students of any major ethnic group varies from the percentage of such students in the overall District student population by +/20%, no additional permits or transfers from this group may be granted into these sites.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">PUSD, Integration Policy and Quality Schooling Plan, Board Policy 0460(c) &#182; 3 [hereinafter \"Board Policy 0460(c) &#182; 3\"].</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Scott has called Board Policy 0460(c) &#182; 3 to our attention in her answering brief, intending to demonstrate that PUSD practiced racial discrimination even in instances where it did not apply the challenged lottery.

Order at 27, addresses Scott's claims of racial and gender discrimination brought under the state and federal constitutions as against the lottery process; the order included no ruling on the transfer policy, and Scott has alleged no facts below supporting her standing to challenge the transfer policy.

In January 1970, PUSD received the dubious distinction of being the first non-Southern school district to be placed under a consent decree by a federal district court in order to remedy <i>de jure</i> racial segregation within its public school system. <i>Spangler v. Pasadena City Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2127039\"><a href=\"/opinion/2127039/spangler-v-pasadena-city-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span> (C.D.Cal.1970). The court's injunction resulted in a radical restructuring of school attendance zones throughout the city, known as the Pasadena Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The injunction lasted for nine years until PUSD was declared unitary and released from judicial supervision by order of this court. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"372967\"><a href=\"/opinion/372967/nancy-anne-spangler-by-her-father-and-next-friend-james-e-spangler-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1979). We overruled the district court's exercise of its equitable discretion to maintain jurisdiction over the District's integration plan based in part upon the Board's \"representations that it would continue to engage in affirmative action in the future in support of integration.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1241. As a result, PUSD formed its first voluntary integration plan in 1980, updating the plan twice in the 1990s to respond to demographic shifts in the district's population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with its goal of providing an integrated public education environment, PUSD currently operates three magnet, or voluntary, schools: Don Benito Fundamental School (\"Don Benito\") including students in grades kindergarten through five, Norma Coombs Alternative School (\"Norma Coombs\") including students in grades kindergarten through eight, and Marshall Fundamental School (\"Marshall\") including students in grades six through twelve. Although every PUSD student is assigned to a neighborhood school, a student may also apply voluntarily to one or more of the voluntary schools, so long as the individual school's curriculum covers the student's present grade. The opportunity for superior academic performance and special resources make admission to the voluntary schools desirable for students who are willing to forgo the convenience of attending neighborhood schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 24, 1998, the Board approved its Integration Policy and Quality Schooling Plan, thereby amending Board Policy 0460.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> According to the policy, the Board instituted a lottery system for assigning students to the voluntary schools, to be used only if a school received more applications than it had available spaces.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The Board amended its voluntary admissions procedures in response to complaints from parents who were previously required to wait in line in order to secure a place for their children on a \"first come, first served\" basis. When the number of students applying for admission to any particular voluntary school exceeded the number of available spaces, the policy first gave priority to siblings of students already enrolled at the school. If spaces remained available after siblings had been admitted, any remaining unassigned students were to be chosen through a computerized lottery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the Board determined that a lottery was appropriate with regard to any particular school, the policy would permit PUSD to weigh gender, race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, language, and special needs as factors within the lottery process for admission to that school. According to the policy, these factors could only be considered \"when necessary to create an integrated setting.\" Board Policy 0460(d) &#182; 8. The use of these factors was further restricted to the selection of students for the entering grades of each voluntary school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parents were informed of the amended policy by a letter from Superintendent Vignes, dated November 30, 1998. The amended policy was to go into effect beginning with applications submitted in the spring of 1999 for the 1999-2000 school year. The Board provided a three-month window for the submission of applications, opening on January 4, 1999, and closing on March 12, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1999, before the revised admissions policy had been implemented at any voluntary school, Vignes presented a report to the Legislative Council of the California Legislature, documenting the use of state-provided, voluntary desegregation funding by PUSD. The report was required by state law governing the use of desegregation funding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In order to maintain eligibility for state voluntary desegregation funding, PUSD was required to demonstrate how programs receiving funding worked both to alleviate the harmful effects of racial segregation and to improve student academic performance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her report, Vignes recounted the District's history of judicial supervision and proclaimed the District's continuing obligation to integrate its public schools. In addition, Vignes presented statistical showings that PUSD's voluntary schools, as well as other schools receiving desegregation funding to support their student transportation programs, consistently out-performed schools that based their enrollment strictly on neighborhood attendance zones. Finally, Vignes represented the lottery system for voluntary school admission as a new amendment to PUSD's longstanding integration policy, furthering the District's effort to comply with state funding requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 1999, PUSD conducted lotteries for two of the three voluntary schools, Don Benito and Norma Coombs. Marshall High School, which did not run a deficit of available spaces in 1999, admitted all student applicants without resorting to a lottery. The two minor plaintiffs (Kalya Hunter and Michaela Reyes) who applied to Marshall were admitted for the 1999-2000 school year. In addition, three plaintiffs (Jocelyne Alva, Ronald Rucker, and Detrick Standmore) did not apply to any voluntary school for the 1999-2000 academic cycle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No minor plaintiff applying to either Norma Coombs or Don Benito was subjected to a lottery process that used race, ethnicity, gender or any other student characteristic as a factor because the applicant pools were determined to be broadly representative of the District's overall student population.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Two minor plaintiffs (Camden Ren&#233; Amy and Marissa Laraine Amy) applied to Norma Coombs, but they simultaneously informed PUSD that they intended to attend Woodrow Wilson Middle School if that school was able to assemble its International Baccalaureate Program. Because the aforementioned program was established for the 1999-2000 school year, their applications were withdrawn from Norma Coombs. Finally, the remaining minor plaintiff (George MacPherson) applied to Don Benito, was included in the lottery process held in April 1999, and was not selected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Procedural History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scott filed the first amended complaint in this case on March 29, 1999. PUSD responded with a motion to dismiss, arguing that Scott lacked standing to challenge the lottery process. The district court denied that motion, concluding that dismissal based on lack of standing was premature, but providing the defendants leave to pursue the issue at summary judgment. In August 1999, the parties entered an agreement to take limited discovery prior to summary judgment, providing for a second discovery phase if summary judgment was not dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 7, 1999, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, again alleging that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing. Scott filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on all claims, except the damages claim under the Unruh Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the defendants' motion, holding that the revised lottery provisions of the policy constituted a denial of equal treatment sufficient to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement for Article III standing. The court further held that \"whether or not Plaintiffs actually suffered racial discrimination is immaterial\" because the plaintiffs were \"ready and able\" to apply to the voluntary schools in the future and \"a discriminatory policy prevented [them] from doing so on an equal basis.\" Mem. Order (Feb. 7, 2000) at 12. The court concluded that \"[t]he language of BP 0460(d)(8), render[ed] untenable Defendants' position that places were assigned in a race-, ethnic-, or gender-neutral manner,\" because, in order to determine whether an adjustment of the random lottery process is necessary to promote integration, the Board must \"always keep[] an eye on the applicant pool to make sure it is a fair representation of the PUSD's racial, ethnic or gender makeup as a whole.\" <i>Id.</i> at 15. The defendants currently appeal the district court's denial of their motion for summary judgment as well as its grant of summary judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the court issued an injunction against future enforcement of BP 0460(d) &#182; 8 to the extent that it considered race, ethnicity, or gender, it did not invalidate the results of the 1999 admissions process. Following the court's filing of its order on February 7, 2000, PUSD suspended enforcement of the policy. PUSD took this action before making any pupil assignments for the 2000-2001 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 20, 2000, the district court issued an order <i>sua sponte</i> dismissing Scott's claims for damages under the Unruh Act for failure to state a claim.

They need only demonstrate that they are ready and able to apply for admission and that the policy threatens to prevent them from applying on an equal basis with other student applicants.

First, Scott alleges that PUSD did in fact subject the plaintiffs to a race- and gender-based admissions process when it monitored the racial and gender composition of the applicant pools for the three schools to which individual plaintiffs applied. Scott alleges that, insofar as PUSD continues to perform this monitoring function, it maintains an unconstitutional barrier to individual plaintiffs' admission to the voluntary schools. The district court agreed with this argument, but its ruling is anomalous. Although the district court found that PUSD \"assigned students to the voluntary schools in a race-neutral manner for the 1999/2000 school year,\" the court concluded that it was \"logically impossible\" for the lotteries to have been run in such a manner because PUSD was required to monitor the racial composition of each applicant pool in order to determine whether race should be applied as a corrective admissions factor.

The court failed to consider, for example, whether the putative harm of monitoring would attach even if the District were not authorized to perform a weighted lottery to compensate for imbalances.

First, the plaintiff must articulate a \"`concrete plan' to violate the law in question.\" 220 F.3d at 1139. Scott presented affidavits before the district court representing the intentions of individual plaintiffs to apply to PUSD voluntary schools during the earliest available application cycle. However, a pledge of general intent to place oneself within the purview of a challenged policy that fails to \"specify ... under what circumstances\" that policy might be enforced will \"not rise to the level of an articulated, concrete plan.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Thomas</i> panel ruled that \"[t]he landlords' expressed `intent' to violate the law on some uncertain day in the future &#8212; if and when an unmarried couple attempts to lease one of their rental properties &#8212; can hardly qualify as a concrete plan.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1140. Like the landlord plaintiffs in <i>Thomas,</i> Scott's professed intention to subject herself to a racial or gender weighted lottery is contingent upon an unpredictable set of societal factors that may or may not arise, and thereby trigger the implementation of a weighted lottery, when an individual plaintiff's application for admission to a voluntary school is made. At the next opportunity for a plaintiff to make an application, that student may be subjected to a weighted lottery, or no lottery may be conducted because no school is oversubscribed, or a lottery may be conducted at one or more schools but it may apply no weighted factor. Scott cannot base her plan to incur actual, constitutional injury upon this insurmountable contingency.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, a plaintiff may satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement by demonstrating that government officials \"have communicated a specific warning or threat\" of enforcement. <i>Id.</i> The <i>Thomas</i> panel reiterated that the threat of enforcement \"must at least be `credible,' not simply `imaginary or speculative.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Babbitt,</i> 442 U.S. at 298, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110099\"><a href=\"/opinion/110099/babbitt-v-farm-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That is, the District has not represented to parents that it expects any future applicant pool to be so grossly out of balance with the district-wide student population that the application of a corrective racial or gender factor is imminent. To the contrary, PUSD Superintendent Vignes has stated that race or ethnicity would be applied as an admissions factor only under \"compelling\" circumstances \"where [a] school was so racially identifiable that it was a segregated school or was fast moving in the direction of becoming a segregated school.\" Decl. of Vera Vignes (Jan. 24, 2000) &#182; 11. Vignes further qualified her assessment by stating that PUSD \"ha[s] not yet faced [such] a situation.\" <i>Id.</i> Scott offers no contravening evidence. Thus, her assessment that BP 0460(d) &#182; 8 threatens a racial or gender-based admissions process in the near future at PUSD voluntary schools is purely speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the <i>Thomas</i> panel held that a claim for prospective relief can be based on a history of discriminatory enforcement of the challenged governmental policy, but the absence of such a history will support a conclusion that a potential injury is not imminent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> 220 F.3d at 1140. Thus, the fact that no individual plaintiff has yet been subjected to a race or gender discriminatory admissions qualification under the policy weakens Scott's claim of standing to seek prospective relief insofar as the lack of prior implementation of the policy leaves us without a basis upon which to infer that the threat to Scott is genuine. <i>See also Lyons,</i> 461 U.S. at 102, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110916\"><a href=\"/opinion/110916/los-angeles-v-lyons/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court instructively described the difference between the injury requirement for standing to sue for damages and standing to obtain injunctive relief, stating \"[t]hat Lyons may have been illegally choked by the police ... while presumably affording Lyons standing to claim damages... does nothing to establish a real and immediate threat that he would again be stopped [for any offense], by an officer or officers who would illegally choke him.\" <i>Id.</i> at 105, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110916\"><a href=\"/opinion/110916/los-angeles-v-lyons/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Currently, we have no basis from which to infer how racial or gender criteria might correlate with other criteria, such as socioeconomic status and language, in PUSD's actual implementation of the challenged policy. For example, we know neither if the weighted lottery system will allow for PUSD to make significant racial adjustments in its student body by considering non-suspect criteria, either in tandem with or instead of racial criteria, nor if the district would give deference to non-suspect criteria in order to circumscribe its consideration of race to conform to the requirements of narrow tailoring.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> Moreover, even if the parties had engaged in a second discovery phase, it is unlikely that a sufficient factual basis for adjudication could have been laid relying upon the single academic cycle during which the challenged policy was in effect but did not result in the use of any weighted admissions factor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without knowing the conditions under which such a policy is to be implemented, no court can make a true determination as to whether the policy as practiced uses race in a way that is necessary to satisfy the compelling interest of student-body diversity. <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 313-17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
