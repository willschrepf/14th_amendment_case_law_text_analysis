That sentiment emerges at times of social upheaval, when ethnic Chinese are often made the \"scapegoats\" for Indonesia's economic and political problems.

In <i>Hartooni,</i> the asylum applicant was a Christian Armenian from Iran. The Iranian government had closed the applicant's Armenian Christian school and forbidden the celebration of Christmas. 21 F.3d at 341. One time, soldiers stoned Hartooni's church while she was inside. <i>Id.</i> Another time, they approached Hartooni and a group of girls, who did not have their hair properly bound, and took some of the girls away, although Hartooni managed to escape. <i>Id.</i> Soldiers also visited Hartooni's family's home to ask about relatives who had fled to the United States, including Hartooni. <i>Id.</i> Although Hartooni was never personally harmed, we held that these incidents, if believed, would be \"enough to satisfy the requirement of a personal connection to the general persecution suffered by Christian Armenians in Iran.\" <i>Id.</i> at 342; <i>see also Hoxha,</i> 319 F.3d at 1181, 1184(holding that the petitioner demonstrated a \"particularized risk\" of persecution on account of his Albanian ethnicity with evidence that he was harassed and threatened, attacked on one occasion by a group of anti-Albanian Serbs, and ordered to appear for an \"informative conversation\" with authorities); <i>Avetova-Elisseva,</i> 213 F.3d at 1197, 1201-02(holding that the petitioner established a \"personalized threat\" of future persecution on account of her Armenian ethnicity with evidence that she was \"harassed and pushed by Russian officers\" and could not get a job because of her ethnicity, and with evidence that an Armenian friend's daughter was raped and beaten).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in <i>Hartooni, Hoxha,</i> and <i>Avetova-Elisseva,</i> Sael's past experiences establish a sufficient personal connection to the general persecution directed against ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. Accordingly, we hold that Sael's credible testimony compels the conclusion that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting Sael's claim of a well-founded fear based on a \"pattern or practice\" of persecution, the BIA relied on two statements in the State Department's 1999 Indonesia Country Report &#8212; one that the Indonesian government \"officially promotes\" ethnic tolerance and a second that \"[r]acially motivated attacks against ethnic Chinese dropped sharply\" in 1999. 1999 Indonesia Country Report &#167; 5 (AR 223). Although we agree with the BIA that these statements could undermine an asylum applicant's claim that there is a \"pattern or practice\" of persecution, <i>Kotasz,</i> 31 F.3d at 852, the statements do not diminish Sael's claim of the general persecution of ethnic Chinese, sufficient to characterize their status as \"disfavored\" in Indonesia. The 1999 Indonesia Country Report confirms that ethnic Chinese are at least a \"disfavored\" minority group. It documents continued resentment, discrimination and ethnic violence; official prohibitions on Chinese schools and associations; and a failure to follow up on recommendations for improvement after the 1998 riots. 1999 Indonesia Country Report &#167;&#167; 1.c, 5 (AR 178, 189-90, 218, 223). It also documents an inadequate government response to inter-religious violence that is often directed against Chinese Christians. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5 (AR 178, 221).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Compared with this evidence, the statements relied on by the BIA have little relevance to Sael's claim. Official discrimination continues, and hundreds of pages of news articles and human rights reports document a centuries-old anti-Chinese sentiment that continues to erupt in violence during periods of social, political or economic difficulty. <i>See, e.g., Indonesia Alert</i> (referring to \"spasms\" of anti-Chinese violence). By relying on a one-year decline that is actually <i>consistent</i> with this cycle of waxing and waning violence, the BIA ignored the central issue raised by Sael's past experiences and by the compelling historical record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> When a minority group's \"disfavored\" status is rooted in centuries of persecution, year-to-year fluctuations cannot reasonably be viewed as disposing of an applicant's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simply put, the two statements emphasized by the BIA are not \"substantial evidence\" for the denial of asylum in Sael's case. <i>Khup v.
