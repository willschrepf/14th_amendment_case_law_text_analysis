District Attorney for the\n\nSuffolk Dist., 466 Mass. 655 (2013) (Diatchenko I), this court\n\nconsidered the constitutionality of a life sentence without\n\nparole when applied to a juvenile homicide offender,3 and,\n\nfollowing Miller v. Alabama, 132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), determined\n\nthat the mandatory imposition of such a sentence violates the\n\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishments in the Eighth\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution as well as art. 26\n\nof the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.4   Diatchenko I, supra\n\n\n     3\n       The term \"juvenile homicide offender\" refers in this\nopinion to a person who has been convicted of murder in the\nfirst degree and was under the age of eighteen at the time that\nhe or she committed the murder.\n     4\n       This court also concluded in Diatchenko v. District\nAttorney for the Suffolk Dist., 466 Mass. 655, 671 (2013)\n(Diatchenko I), that the discretionary imposition of a sentence\n\f                                                                    3\n\n\nat 668.   The court held that a juvenile homicide offender who is\n\nconvicted of murder in the first degree and receives a mandatory\n\nsentence of life in prison must be afforded a \"meaningful\n\nopportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and\n\nrehabilitation,\" and this opportunity must come through\n\nconsideration for release on parole.   Id. at 674, quoting Graham\n\nv. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 75 (2010).\n\n     The court's opinion in Diatchenko I has given rise to\n\nquestions concerning how the opportunity for release on parole\n\nwill be protected for juvenile homicide offenders.\n\nSpecifically, Gregory Diatchenko and Jeffrey S. Roberio,5 each of\n\nwhom was convicted of murder in the first degree many years ago\n\nfor a crime committed when he was seventeen years old,6 argue\n\nthat in order to ensure that their opportunity for release\n\nthrough parole is meaningful, they must have, in connection with\n\na petition for release before the parole board (board), access\n\nto counsel, access to funds for counsel and for expert witnesses\n\n\nof life in prison without parole violates art. 26 of the\nMassachusetts Declaration of Rights, which forbids the\ninfliction of \"cruel or unusual punishments.\"\n     5\n       As discussed infra, in September of 2014, Roberio moved to\nintervene as a petitioner in Gregory Diatchenko's case, and the\nmotion was allowed.\n     6\n       For further discussion of the crimes for which Diatchenko\nand Roberio were convicted, see Commonwealth v. Diatchenko, 387\nMass. 718 (1982), and Commonwealth v. Roberio, 428 Mass. 278\n(1998), S.C., 440 Mass. 245 (2003).\n\f                                                                       4\n\n\nbecause they are indigent, and an opportunity for judicial\n\nreview of the decision on their parole applications.      For the\n\nreasons discussed below, we agree in substance with Diatchenko\n\nand Roberio.7\n\n     1.   Procedural history.   a.   Diatchenko.   In March of 2013,\n\nDiatchenko filed the present action in the county court, seeking\n\na declaration that, because he was convicted of murder in the\n\nfirst degree and was seventeen at the time he committed the\n\noffense, his mandatory sentence of life without parole was\n\nunconstitutional following the United States Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2469.      The single justice\n\nreported the case to the full court.\n\n     The court issued its opinion in December, 2013.     See\n\nDiatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 655.      Having determined that juvenile\n\nhomicide offenders could not validly be sentenced to life in\n\nprison without parole, the court turned to the task of finding\n\nan appropriate way to achieve a constitutionally permissible\n\nresult, while still recognizing the Legislature's primary role\n\n     7\n       We acknowledge the two amicus briefs submitted in support\nof Diatchenko and Roberio by Citizens for Juvenile Justice, the\nChildren's League of Massachusetts, Prisoners' Legal Services of\nMassachusetts, the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth,\nthe Justice Resource Institute, the Coalition for Effective\nPublic Safety, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and\nEconomic Justice, Professor Daniel Medwed, and the Hon. Gail\nGaringer (ret.); as well as the amicus brief submitted in\nsupport of Diatchenko by the Massachusetts Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers.\n\f                                                                       5\n\n\nin establishing sentences for criminal offenses.   The approach\n\nwe took was to declare invalid, as applied to juvenile homicide\n\noffenders, certain language in G. L. c. 265, § 2, creating an\n\nexception to parole eligibility for those convicted of murder in\n\nthe first degree and leaving in full effect the remainder of the\n\nstatute that imposed a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nSee Diatchenko I, supra at 673.   The result was that any\n\njuvenile offender previously convicted of murder in the first\n\ndegree, including Diatchenko, became eligible for parole after\n\nserving fifteen years of his or her sentence.   See id.     See also\n\nG. L. c. 265, § 2, as amended through St. 1982, c. 554, § 3;\n\nG. L. c. 127, § 133A, as amended through St. 1965, c. 766, § 1.\n\nBecause Diatchenko had already served approximately thirty-one\n\nyears of his life sentence, he became eligible for parole\n\nimmediately.   See Diatchenko I, supra.8\n\n    Pursuant to the opinion's rescript, the case was remanded\n\nto the single justice with the direction to enter a judgment\n\n\n    8\n       In Commonwealth v. Brown, 466 Mass. 676 (2013), decided\nthe same day as Diatchenko I, the remedy in Diatchenko I was\nextended to include juvenile offenders sentenced to life in\nprison for murder in the first degree going forward, such that\nthey also are entitled to a parole hearing. Brown, supra at\n688. The Legislature has since responded to these decisions by\namending G. L. c. 265, § 2, and G. L. c. 127, § 133A, to\nincorporate into the statutes parole eligibility for juvenile\noffenders convicted of first-degree murder. See G. L. c. 265,\n§ 2, as amended through St. 2014, c. 189, § 5; G. L. c. 127,\n§ 133A, as amended through St. 2014, c. 189, § 3.\n\f                                                                    6\n\n\nconsistent with the court's opinion in the case and to \"take\n\nsuch further action as is necessary and appropriate.\"   On\n\nFebruary 27, 2014, Diatchenko filed a motion for entry of a\n\njudgment that would include a number of orders of specific\n\nrelief, and also filed a motion for funds to retain an expert in\n\nconnection with his hearing before the board.   The district\n\nattorney for the Suffolk District (district attorney), the chair\n\nof the board, and the Commissioner of Correction (commissioner)\n\nfiled oppositions.   After a hearing, the single justice reserved\n\nand reported Diatchenko's case as well as Roberio's case, next\n\ndiscussed, to the full court.\n\n    In connection with the Diatchenko case, the single justice\n\nreported the following questions:\n\n    \"1. Whether, in order to ensure that the petitioner and\n    other similarly situated juvenile homicide offenders\n    receive the 'meaningful opportunity to obtain release' that\n    is required by the court's opinion [in Diatchenko I], they\n    must be afforded:\n\n    \"a. the right to assistance of counsel at their parole\n    hearings, including the right to have counsel appointed if\n    they are indigent; and\n\n    \"b. the right to public funds, if they are indigent, in\n    order to secure reasonably necessary expert assistance at\n    the hearings.\n\n    \"2. Whether, in order to ensure that the petitioner and\n    other similarly situated juvenile homicide offenders\n    receive the 'meaningful opportunity to obtain release' that\n    is required by the court's opinion, there must be an\n    opportunity for the petitioner or a similarly situated\n    individual who is denied parole to obtain judicial review\n\f                                                                       7\n\n\n    of the parole board's decision, and if so, what form the\n    judicial review will take.\"\n\n    b.    Roberio.   Following the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nMiller, in June, 2013, Roberio sought relief from his mandatory\n\nsentence of life without parole by moving in the Superior Court\n\nfor resentencing under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30, as appearing in 435\n\nMass. 1501 (2001).    He also filed a motion for funds pursuant to\n\nrule 30 (c) (5) to pay an expert neuropsychologist for\n\nassistance in connection with his motion for resentencing.       The\n\nmotion for funds was allowed, but Roberio's motion for\n\nresentencing was stayed pending the release of our decision in\n\nDiatchenko I, at which point he was resentenced to life with\n\nparole eligibility after fifteen years in prison.    Because\n\nRoberio had been in prison for more than fifteen years, he was\n\nimmediately eligible for parole.\n\n    On February 27, 2014, Roberio filed another motion for\n\nfunds pursuant to rule 30 (c) (5) to retain the services of a\n\nsecond neuropsychologist because the previous neuropsychologist\n\nhad died; Roberio sought to retain the expert in order to\n\ncontinue to seek to have his sentence reduced to a term of years\n\nor, alternatively, to assist him in connection with seeking\n\nparole.   A second Superior Court judge allowed the motion after\n\nhearing, but stayed the order to permit the Commonwealth to seek\n\nrelief from the single justice.    On March 10, 2014, the\n\f                                                                      8\n\n\nCommonwealth filed a petition for relief under G. L. c. 211,\n\n§ 3, challenging the orders allowing Roberio's requests for\n\nfunds to retain the experts.     As indicated, on May 23, 2014, the\n\nsingle justice reserved and reported the Roberio case to the\n\nfull court for decision, to be paired with the Diatchenko case.\n\nIn September, 2014, Roberio filed a motion to intervene in the\n\nDiatchenko case.    The single justice allowed the motion.\n\n    2.    Suggestion of mootness.    \"Litigation ordinarily is\n\nconsidered moot when the party claiming to be aggrieved ceases\n\nto have a personal stake in its outcome.\"     Acting Supt. of\n\nBournewood Hosp. v. Baker, 431 Mass. 101, 103 (2000),\n\nquoting Attorney Gen. v. Commissioner of Ins., 403 Mass. 370,\n\n380 (1988).    The chair of the board, the commissioner, and the\n\ndistrict attorney suggest that the case is moot with respect to\n\nDiatchenko because on October 31, 2014, the board approved his\n\napplication for parole, and therefore, they contend, Diatchenko\n\nno longer has a personal stake in the resolution of the present\n\ncase.    See Massachusetts Parole Board, No. W38579, at 1 (Oct.\n\n31, 2014).    However, Diatchenko has not yet been released on\n\nparole; rather, the board required that Diatchenko first spend\n\ntwelve months in a lower security prison before he may be\n\nreleased, so that he may \"transition gradually to the\n\ncommunity.\"    Id. at 7.   Since Diatchenko has not yet been\n\nreleased, he continues to have a personal stake in the outcome\n\f                                                                      9\n\n\nof the case, and therefore his petition is not moot.     Moreover,\n\nRoberio has been permitted to intervene in the Diatchenko case,\n\nand he has not yet had a parole hearing.     Even if the case were\n\nmoot as to Diatchenko, therefore, it is not moot with respect to\n\nRoberio.    We proceed to consider the reported questions and\n\nrelated claims raised on their merits.\n\n     3.    Discussion.   a.   Right to assistance of counsel.   The\n\nfirst reported question asks whether a juvenile homicide\n\noffender must be afforded the assistance of counsel in\n\nconnection with his or her initial parole hearing.9     It is\n\nimportant to view the question in context.     The court's\n\nconclusion in Diatchenko I, that juvenile homicide offenders\n\ncould not permissibly be subjected to life in prison without any\n\nopportunity for parole, flowed from the \"fundamental '\"precept\n\nof justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and\n\nproportioned\" to both the offender and the offense,'\" a central\n\ntenet of the Eighth Amendment and of art. 26.     Diatchenko I, 466\n\nMass. at 669, quoting Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2463.     Drawing from\n\nthe United States Supreme Court's recent decisions that focused\n\non the requirement of proportional sentencing of youth, and in\n\n     9\n       The reported questions do not specify the initial parole\nhearing, but we understand that to be the intended focus, and\nconsider it as such. We therefore do not consider here whether\nthe procedural rights that we discuss in this opinion only apply\nwith respect to a juvenile homicide offender's initial parole\nhearing.\n\f                                                                    10\n\n\nparticular the decisions in Miller and Graham,10 Diatchenko I\n\nobserved that \"children are constitutionally different from\n\nadults for purposes of sentencing\" and that the \"distinctive\n\nattributes of juvenile offenders\" render suspect the traditional\n\njustifications for imposing sentences of life without parole on\n\nthese individuals.   Diatchenko I, supra at 670-671, quoting\n\nMiller, supra at 2465.   Therefore, in Diatchenko I, we held that\n\nDiatchenko and all juvenile homicide offenders serving mandatory\n\nlife sentences deserve at least a \"meaningful opportunity to\n\nobtain release based on demonstrated maturity and\n\nrehabilitation,\" and that accordingly, at the appropriate time,\n\nthey must be considered for parole suitability.     Diatchenko I,\n\nsupra at 671, 674, quoting Graham, 560 U.S. at 75.    In other\n\nwords, the conclusion we reached was that parole eligibility is\n\nan essential component of a constitutional sentence under art.\n\n26 for a juvenile homicide offender subject to mandatory life in\n\nprison.11\n\n\n     10\n       In Miller v. Alabama, 132 S. Ct. 2455, 2469 (2012), as\nnoted previously, the United States Supreme Court held that the\nEighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits\nmandatory sentences of life without parole for those who were\nunder the age of eighteen at the time they committed murder; in\nGraham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 75 (2010), the Court held that\nthose who committed a nonhomicide offense before the age of\neighteen can never receive such sentences.\n     11\n       Justice Spina's dissent argues that because Miller refers\nspecifically to the requirement of proportionality in\n\f                                                                     11\n\n\n       In general, there is no constitutionally protected liberty\n\ninterest in a grant of parole.      See Greenholtz v. Inmates of the\n\nNeb. Penal & Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 7 (1979); Quegan\n\nv. Massachusetts Parole Bd., 423 Mass. 834, 836 (1996); Greenman\n\nv. Massachusetts Parole Bd., 405 Mass. 384, 388 n.3 (1989).\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that in some cases,\n\na liberty interest in parole requiring at least some minimal due\n\nprocess rights may derive from language in a State's parole\n\nstatute that creates a \"protectible expectation of parole.\"      See\n\nGreenholtz, supra at 11-12 (statutory language and structure of\n\nNebraska parole statute created expectancy of release\n\nconstituting liberty interest entitled to protection of due\n\nprocess clause).      See also Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S.\n\n369, 371-372, 381 (1987).\n\n       Here, G. L. c. 127, § 130, does not create an expectation\n\nof release through parole, as Justice Spina's dissent points\n\nout.    See post at      .   Rather, what is at issue is art. 26's\n\n\n\n\"sentencing,\" unless a parole hearing is viewed as part of the\nsentencing process, there can be no constitutional basis for the\nprocedural protections in parole hearings that the petitioners\nseek. See post at     . However, in concluding that all\njuvenile homicide offenders must have access to a \"meaningful\nopportunity to obtain release,\" Diatchenko I identified under\nart. 26 a substantive requirement concerning the nature of the\nsentences that juvenile homicide offenders must receive. See\nDiatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 671, 674, quoting Graham, 560 U.S. at\n75. This requirement goes beyond the procedural issue that\nMiller identified under the Eighth Amendment.\n\f                                                                  12\n\n\nrequirement that a juvenile homicide offender serving a\n\nmandatory life sentence be provided a meaningful opportunity to\n\nobtain release, so that his or her sentence is not effectively\n\none of straight life in prison -- an outcome that art. 26\n\nprohibits.   In this context, where the meaningful opportunity\n\nfor release through parole is necessary in order to conform the\n\njuvenile homicide offender's mandatory life sentence to the\n\nrequirements of art. 26, the parole process takes on a\n\nconstitutional dimension that does not exist for other offenders\n\nwhose sentences include parole eligibility.12\n\n     Thus, for example, in the case of an adult defendant\n\nconvicted of armed robbery and sentenced to a term of not less\n\nthan sixteen nor more than twenty years in prison, the defendant\n\n\n     12\n       The fact that the opportunity for release through parole\nis essential in order to guarantee the constitutionality of a\njuvenile homicide offender's mandatory sentence of life in\nprison does not \"transform[] the conduct of the parole hearing\ninto part of the sentencing process\" in this context, as Justice\nSpina's dissent suggests. See post at     . Rather, for a\njuvenile homicide offender -- as for virtually any offender\nexcept an adult convicted of murder in the first degree -- the\noffender's sentence is fixed at the time of sentencing, and the\nopportunity to seek parole is merely a component of the sentence\nthat the offender receives from a judge. See Commonwealth v.\nCole, 468 Mass. 294, 298-299, 302 (2014). See also G. L.\nc. 279, § 24. Our decision today does not undermine this\nrelationship between sentencing and parole, but rather explores\nfurther the purpose that parole eligibility serves in the\ncontext of a juvenile homicide offender’s mandatory life\nsentence, and the additional protections that juvenile homicide\noffenders require in order to ensure that that purpose is fully\nachieved.\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\nwould be eligible for parole in sixteen years,13 but if the\n\ndefendant were denied a meaningful opportunity for release on\n\nparole, this would not render the sentence cruel or unusual and\n\ntherefore unconstitutional under art. 26.    This is so because a\n\nState has no obligation to provide a parole system, see\n\nGreenholtz, 442 U.S. at 7-8, and if the defendant were to serve\n\nhis or her entire sentence of twenty years with no opportunity\n\nat all for release on parole, that would have been a permissible\n\nsentence for the judge to have imposed at the outset.     The same\n\nis not true for juvenile homicide offenders; under G. L. c. 265,\n\n§ 2, they must be sentenced to life in prison, but art. 26 does\n\nnot allow either the Legislature or a judge to sentence such an\n\noffender to life in prison without the possibility of parole.14\n\n\n     13\n          See G. L. c. 127, § 133; G. L. c. 279, § 24.\n     14\n       Justice Spina's dissent emphasizes, post at    , that our\ndecisions in Diatchenko I, Brown, Commonwealth v. Ray, 467 Mass.\n115 (2014), and Commonwealth v. Keo, 467 Mass. 25 (2014), each\napplied the mandatory life sentence as specified in G. L.\nc. 265, § 2, for murder in the first degree to juvenile homicide\noffenders, albeit with the added instruction that these\noffenders must be eligible for parole in accordance with the\nparole statute. See Ray, supra at 140; Keo, supra at 46-47.\nSee also Diatchenko I, supra at 674 (\"At the appropriate time,\nit is the purview of the . . . board to evaluate the\ncircumstances surrounding the commission of the crime, including\nthe age of the offender, together with all relevant information\npertaining to the offender's character and actions during the\nintervening years since conviction. By this process, a juvenile\nhomicide offender will be afforded a meaningful opportunity to\nbe considered for parole suitability\"). From this, the dissent\nconcludes that these decisions stand for the propositions that\n\f                                                                   14\n\n\n     We turn, then, to the question of what is procedurally\n\nrequired in order to protect a juvenile homicide offender's\n\nexpectation of \"a meaningful opportunity to obtain release based\n\non demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\"   Graham, 560 U.S.\n\nat 75.15   \"The extent of procedural due process which must be\n\n\n\nthe existing parole procedures already afford a meaningful\nopportunity for release and that juvenile homicide offenders are\n\"entitled only to the same parole hearing process as other\ninmates.\" See post at     . The dissent then contends that\ntoday's decision improperly changes course and affords something\nmore. See post at     . We disagree that we have changed\ncourse. The cited decisions focused explicitly on the\nsubstantive punishment that the defendants in those cases must\nreceive; in none of them did the court address any issue\nregarding the nature of the parole process for juvenile homicide\noffenders. See Diatchenko I, supra at 674 n.18 (\"The heart of\nthis case is the constitutional validity of Diatchenko's\nsentence for murder in the first degree\"). Moreover, as\ndiscussed infra, nothing in this opinion suggests that the\nprocedures described in G. L. c. 127, § 133A, no longer apply to\njuvenile homicide offenders. Rather, today's decision\nidentifies additional procedural protections that must be\nafforded to these offenders within the context of the existing\nparole process, and an opportunity for a limited review of the\nboard's decision.\n\n     Similarly, today's decision in no way conflicts with the\nSupreme Court's holdings in Miller and Graham. Each of those\ncases addressed a specific context in which the Eighth Amendment\nprohibits the imposition of a sentence of life without parole on\na juvenile offender. See Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2471; Graham,\n560 U.S. at 75. Parole was not the subject of Miller and\nGraham; life without parole was. Those cases leave open the\nquestion of how to ensure that Miller's and Graham's requirement\nof a \"meaningful opportunity to obtain release\" for certain\njuvenile offenders is to be realized. See Miller, supra at\n2469; Graham, supra at 75.\n     15\n       We emphasize that the offender does not have a\nprotectable expectation that he or she necessarily will be\n\f                                                                   15\n\n\nafforded in any situation varies with the nature of the private\n\nand governmental interests at stake . . . , but basic to due\n\nprocess is the right to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in a\n\nmeaningful manner.'\"     Department of Pub. Welfare v. J.K.B., 379\n\nMass. 1, 3-4 (1979) (J.K.B.), quoting Armstrong v. Manzo, 380\n\nU.S. 545, 552 (1965).     This court has concluded, for example,\n\nthat an \"indigent parent facing the possible loss of a child\n\ncannot be said to have a meaningful right to be heard in a\n\ncontested proceeding without the assistance of counsel.\"\n\nJ.K.B., supra at 4.    See Adoption of Meaghan, 461 Mass. 1006,\n\n1007-1008 (2012) (where child's guardians filed petition for\n\nadoption that, if granted, would terminate parental rights, both\n\nnonconsenting indigent father and consenting child entitled to\n\nappointed counsel to provide meaningful opportunity to be\n\nheard).   See also Guardianship of V.V., 470 Mass. 590, 592-593\n\n(2015).   For reasons we discuss next, the court's reasons for\n\ndeeming appointment of counsel necessary in this context are\n\ninstructive here:     \"[t]he petition may well involve complex\n\nquestions of fact and law, and require the marshalling and\n\nrebutting of sophisticated expert testimony\"; and \"[p]rovision\n\n\n\nreleased at a particular time, or even at all. See Diatchenko\nI, 466 Mass. at 674. As discussed infra, the determination of\nwhether a juvenile homicide offender merits parole requires\nconsideration of many factors, which may or may not indicate\nthat release is appropriate for any particular individual.\n\f                                                                  16\n\n\nof appointed counsel not only safeguards the rights of the\n\nparents, but it assists the court in reaching its decision with\n\nthe 'utmost care' and 'an extra measure of evidentiary\n\nprotection,' required by law.\"   J.K.B., supra, quoting Custody\n\nof a Minor (No. 1), 377 Mass. 876, 877, 884 (1979).\n\n     By statute, the board is required to determine an\n\nindividual's suitability for parole based on whether there is,\n\nin the opinion of the board, a \"reasonable probability that, if\n\n[a] prisoner is released with appropriate conditions and\n\ncommunity supervision, the prisoner will live and remain at\n\nliberty without violating the law and that release is not\n\nincompatible with the welfare of society.\"   G. L. c. 127, § 130.\n\nThe decision is a discretionary one for the board \"with which,\n\nif otherwise constitutionally exercised, the judiciary may not\n\ninterfere.\"16   See Commonwealth v. Cole, 468 Mass. 294, 302\n\n(2014).   In rendering a parole decision, the board is entitled\n\nto obtain significant amounts of information, including the\n\nfollowing:   recommendations from parole staff; the inmate's\n\nprior criminal record; reports concerning the nature and\n\ncircumstances of the offense, such as police reports, grand jury\n\n     16\n       We return to this point infra. Nothing in this opinion\nis intended to suggest that a judge or a court has the authority\nto decide whether a particular juvenile homicide offender is\nentitled to release on parole; judicial review is limited to the\nquestion whether the board has \"constitutionally exercised\" its\ndiscretion. Cole, 468 Mass. at 302.\n\f                                                                    17\n\n\nminutes, and trial transcripts; victim statements; information\n\nabout the inmate's physical, medical, mental, and psychiatric\n\nstatus; disciplinary reports; classification reports; work\n\nevaluations; and records of educational achievements.   See 120\n\nCode Mass Regs. § 300.05 (1997).   See also G. L. c. 127, § 135.\n\nThe Department of Correction (department) maintains much of this\n\ninformation in a so-called \"six-part folder\" for the individual\n\ninmate that dates back to when the inmate was first detained in\n\na Massachusetts correctional institution.   See 103 Code Mass.\n\nRegs. §§ 155.07, 155.08 (2004).    However, an inmate's access to\n\ncertain evaluative information contained in this folder as well\n\nas other types of information available to the board may be\n\nrestricted.   See 103 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 155.10, 157.08 (2005);\n\n120 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 301.04, 500.06 (2001).\n\n    The full board conducts initial parole hearings for\n\nindividuals serving life sentences.   120 Code Mass. Regs.\n\n§ 301.06(1) (2001).   Notice of the hearing is provided to\n\ngovernment officials, including the Attorney General, the office\n\nof the district attorney in whose district the inmate's sentence\n\nwas imposed, the chief of police of the municipality where the\n\ncrime was committed, and the Executive Office of Public Safety,\n\nas well as to the victim or the victim's immediate family\n\nmembers.   See G. L. c. 127, § 133A; 120 Code Mass. Regs.\n\n§ 301.06(3) (2001).   During the parole hearing, the inmate or\n\f                                                                   18\n\n\nhis or her representative has an opportunity to make an opening\n\nstatement, and then the inmate responds to questions from the\n\nboard.    120 Code Mass. Regs. § 301.06(4) (2001).   The board also\n\nmay pose questions to any individual who appears in support of\n\nthe inmate.   Id.   After the inmate has completed his or her\n\npresentation, the victim or victim's family has an opportunity\n\nto speak, as do public officials, and the board is tasked with\n\neliciting \"available evidence and testimony unfavorable to the\n\ninmate upon any relevant subject.\"    Id.   The board may permit\n\nthe inmate to make a closing statement and may allow parties to\n\nsubmit memoranda or other documentation after the hearing.      120\n\nCode Mass. Regs. §§ 301.06(4), (5) (2001).    The board permits\n\nattorneys to represent inmates serving life sentences at their\n\nparole hearings, although currently there is no provision for\n\nproviding counsel to those who are indigent.17    120 Code Mass.\n\nRegs. § 300.08 (1997).\n\n     The question the board must answer for each inmate seeking\n\nparole, namely, whether he or she is likely to reoffend,\n\nrequires the board to weigh multiple factors and consider a wide\n\n\n     17\n       The board and the commissioner recognize in their brief\nthat \"certain benefits flow from access to counsel and experts,\"\nand therefore have taken no position on the first two questions\nreported by the single justice in the Diatchenko case. The\ndistrict attorney for the Suffolk District, however, argues that\nDiatchenko and Roberio are not entitled to counsel, funds to\nretain counsel, or funds to retain experts.\n\f                                                                   19\n\n\nvariety of evidence.   In the case of a juvenile homicide\n\noffender -- at least at the initial parole hearing -- the task\n\nis probably far more complex than in the case of an adult\n\noffender because of \"the unique characteristics\" of juvenile\n\noffenders.   Diatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 674.   See Miller, 132 S.\n\nCt. at 2464.   A potentially massive amount of information bears\n\non these issues, including legal, medical, disciplinary,\n\neducational, and work-related evidence.   In addition, although a\n\nparole hearing is unlike a traditional trial in that it does not\n\ninvolve direct and cross-examination of witnesses by attorneys,\n\nbecause the inmate's parole application may well be opposed by\n\nboth the victim's family and public officials, it would be\n\ndifficult to characterize this as an uncontested proceeding.\n\n     Thus, like a proceeding to terminate parental rights, a\n\nparole hearing for a juvenile homicide offender serving a\n\nmandatory life sentence involves complex and multifaceted issues\n\nthat require the potential marshalling, presentation, and\n\nrebuttal of information derived from many sources.   See J.K.B.,\n\n379 Mass. at 4.   An unrepresented, indigent juvenile homicide\n\noffender will likely lack the skills and resources to gather,\n\nanalyze, and present this evidence adequately.18   Furthermore,\n\n\n     18\n       A juvenile homicide offender -- who will have spent his\nor her entire adult life and presumably some of his or her\nteenage years in prison -- also will likely need to overcome a\n\f                                                                  20\n\n\nalthough parole hearings are not contested in the strictest\n\nsense, the juvenile homicide offender seeking parole is likely\n\nto be required to overcome arguments by both victims' family\n\nmembers and government officials opposed to the offender's\n\nrelease; the former of these parties may present as particularly\n\nsympathetic, while the latter will likely have greater advocacy\n\nskills than the offender seeking parole.19\n\n     In sum, given the challenges involved for a juvenile\n\nhomicide offender serving a mandatory life sentence to advocate\n\neffectively for parole release on his or her own, and in light\n\nof the fact that the offender's opportunity for release is\n\ncritical to the constitutionality of the sentence, we conclude\n\n\n\nhost of personal challenges in order to be able to present a\npersuasive case for parole on his or her own. The challenges\ncould include a lack of formal education, as well as undeveloped\ncritical thinking and organizational skills; a history of\ntrauma, drug use, or mental illness; a limited ability to access\nhis or her own psychiatric or other record information regarding\nthe impact or context of this history; and balancing the need to\ntake responsibility and express remorse for the crime, while at\nthe same time pointing out all the factors that may have made\nhim or her, as a juvenile, less morally culpable. See Russell,\nReview for Release: Juvenile Offenders, State Parole Practices,\nand the Eighth Amendment, 89 Ind. L.J. 373, 419-421 (2014). An\nespecially significant challenge is likely to be the juvenile\noffender's isolation from the outside community, making it\ndifficult to present a solid release plan. See id. at 421.\n     19\n       Additionally, as noted in the context of parental rights\ntermination cases, the availability of counsel in a case may\nhelp to clarify for the decision maker some of the more\ncomplicated issues involved. See Department of Pub. Welfare v.\nJ.K.B., 379 Mass. 1, 4 (1979).\n\f                                                                 21\n\n\nthat this opportunity is not likely to be \"meaningful\" as\n\nrequired by art. 26 without access to counsel.\n\n     Turning to the question of appointment of counsel for\n\nindigent juvenile homicide offenders like Diatchenko and\n\nRoberio, G. L. c. 211D, § 5, authorizes the Committee for Public\n\nCounsel Services (committee) to maintain a system for\n\nappointment of counsel at any stage of a criminal or noncriminal\n\nproceeding in which \"the laws of the commonwealth or the rules\n\nof the supreme judicial court require that a person in such\n\nproceeding be represented by counsel . . . provided . . . that\n\nsuch person is unable to obtain counsel by reason of his\n\nindigency.\"    In light of our conclusion here that a juvenile\n\nhomicide offender serving a mandatory life sentence must have\n\naccess to counsel in connection with an initial application for\n\nparole, § 5D offers legislative authorization and an appropriate\n\nmechanism, through the work of the committee, for the\n\nappointment of counsel for indigent juvenile homicide\n\noffenders.20\n\n\n     20\n       We acknowledge that Quegan v. Massachusetts Parole Bd.,\n423 Mass. 834 (1996), appears to contradict this conclusion.\nSee id. at 840 (\"[The Committee for Public Counsel Services\n(CPCS)] has no right, however, to represent an indigent prisoner\nbefore the parole board unless there is a criminal proceeding\npending in which CPCS represents the prisoner and representation\nof the prisoner-defendant before the parole board is appropriate\nin order to protect the defendant's interests in the pending\ncriminal matter\"). However, Quegan was decided in the context\n\f                                                                  22\n\n\n     b.   Access to funds for expert witnesses.   The second\n\nreported question concerns access to expert witnesses.21\n\nDiatchenko and Roberio contend that, like access to counsel, it\n\nis necessary, in order to secure a meaningful opportunity for\n\nrelease, to have access to the assistance of expert witnesses.\n\nSpecifically, they argue that, as juvenile offenders convicted\n\nof murder, they need experts to be able to explain and offer\n\nopinions on issues concerning the relationship between\n\nneurobiological immaturity and culpability in general as well as\n\nfactors relating to each of their individual and family\n\ncircumstances that may help both to explain past conduct and\n\nassess future risk of reoffending.   As this court acknowledged\n\nin Diatchenko I, scientific research on adolescent brain\n\ndevelopment has revealed \"myriad significant ways that this\n\ndevelopment impacts a juvenile's personality and behavior,\" some\n\nof which suggest decreased moral culpability for certain\n\n\nof a prisoner seeking parole who had no constitutionally\nprotected interest that entitled him to any due process\nprotections. See id. at 836, 839. Here, we have concluded that\na juvenile homicide offender is entitled to representation by\ncounsel in connection with the initial parole hearing. Legal\nrepresentation of an indigent juvenile homicide offender is thus\nrequired by law. See id. at 839. In addition, the court in\nQuegan was interpreting a section of G. L. c. 211D that has\nsince been repealed by the Legislature. See id.; G. L. c. 211D,\n§ 14, repealed by St. 2011, c. 68, § 117.\n     21\n       The second reported question, in substance, raises many\nif not all of the issues of concern to the Commonwealth in its\nG. L. c. 211, § 3, petition in the Roberio case.\n\f                                                                  23\n\n\njuvenile homicide offenders or indicate a greater potential for\n\nthem to mature to a point where they no longer engage in the\n\nbehaviors that led to their crimes.   See Diatchenko I, 466 Mass.\n\nat 669-670.22   While the assistance of a psychologist or other\n\nexpert witness may not be necessary for every juvenile homicide\n\noffender serving a life sentence who seeks parole, in some cases\n\nsuch assistance may be crucial to the juvenile's ability to\n\nobtain a meaningful chance of release.23\n\n\n     22\n       See also Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2464-2465 (research on\nadolescents showing \"transient rashness, proclivity for risk,\nand inability to assess consequences . . . both lessened a\nchild's 'moral culpability' and enhanced the prospect that, as\nthe years go by and neurological development occurs, his\n'deficiencies will be reformed'\" [citation omitted]); Graham,\n560 U.S. at 68 (\"[D]evelopments in psychology and brain science\ncontinue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and\nadult minds. For example, parts of the brain involved in\nbehavior control continue to mature through late adolescence\").\n     23\n       Roberio's case offers a good example of how a juvenile\nhomicide offender's mental health and cognitive development\nhistory could become a central issue in a parole hearing. At\nRoberio's second murder trial, he presented a defense that, at\nthe time of his crime, he lacked the substantial capacity to\nconform his conduct to the requirements of the law due to an\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder, an oppositional\ndefiant disorder, and a learning disability, all of which were\nexacerbated by alcohol use. See Commonwealth v. Roberio, 440\nMass. 245, 247 (2003). A psychological reevaluation of Roberio\nin 2013, when he was forty-four years old, suggested to the\nneuropsychologist performing the evaluation that many of the\nneurological and behavioral challenges Roberio experienced in\nhis teenage years had resolved. In these circumstances, it may\nbe essential that Roberio be in a position to present the board\nwith an expert opinion explaining the path of his apparent\ngrowth in cognitive and emotional maturity and its relationship\nto the question of whether he would be likely to reoffend if\n\f                                                                  24\n\n\n     Neither G. L. c. 211D, § 5, nor any other statute expressly\n\nauthorizes the expenditure of funds for expert witnesses to\n\nassist such a juvenile in the context of a parole hearing.\n\nRoberio argues that the allowance of the fee request is\n\nauthorized under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (5), which in relevant\n\npart provides:   \"The court, after notice to the Commonwealth and\n\nan opportunity to be heard, may also exercise discretion to\n\nallow the defendant costs associated with the preparation and\n\npresentation of a motion under this rule.\"   However, we agree\n\nwith the Commonwealth that in its current form, rule 30 (c) (5)\n\ndoes not authorize the allowance of funds to a defendant to\n\nretain an expert witness in connection with a parole hearing,\n\nbecause a parole hearing is not a \"motion under this rule [i.e.,\n\nrule 30].\"24\n\n     It is also the case that G. L. c. 261, §§ 27A–27G, the\n\nstatutory provisions generally authorizing the payment of public\n\nfunds to cover costs and fees of indigent litigants, apply most\n\ndirectly to costs and fees relating to court proceedings, not\n\nproceedings before administrative or executive agencies like the\n\n\nreleased on parole. As previously indicated, the board\nacknowledges that the availability of expert witnesses may be\nbeneficial in the parole hearing context.\n     24\n       The motions specifically described in Mass. R. Crim. P.\n30, as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), are a motion under\nrule 30 (a) for immediate release or to correct sentence and a\nmotion for a new trial under rule 30 (b).\n\f                                                                    25\n\n\nboard.    See, e.g., Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 89230 v.\n\nSex Offender Registry Bd., 452 Mass. 764, 778-780 (2008).      In\n\naddition, this court has held that G. L. c. 261, § 27C (4),\n\nprovides \"extra fees and costs,\" including funds for expert\n\nwitnesses,25 only in the context of a \"prosecution, defense or\n\nappeal.\"   See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Davis, 410 Mass. 680, 684\n\n(1991).    See also Commonwealth v. Arriaga, 438 Mass. 556, 569\n\n(2003).    However, these cases have generally addressed the\n\navailability of costs for indigent defendants pursuing\n\nnonconstitutionally mandated procedures.26   Moreover, even where\n\na defendant's right to a particular postconviction procedure is\n\nnot constitutionally guaranteed, as is the case, for example,\n\nwith motions for a new trial, this court has still required that\n\nindigent defendants nevertheless have meaningful access to\n\nwhatever postconviction proceedings the State makes available.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Conceicao, 388 Mass. 255, 261-262 (1983).27\n\n\n     25\n       General Laws c. 267, § 27A, defines \"extra fees and\ncosts\" as including fees for expert assistance.\n     26\n       See Commonwealth v. Davis, 410 Mass. 680, 684 & n.7\n(1991) (posttrial motion at issue was not \"constitutionally\nmandated,\" and therefore indigent defendant had \"no\nconstitutional right to State funding to support investigations\nin anticipation of such a motion\").\n     27\n       Justice Spina's dissent notes that the result in\nCommonwealth v. Conceicao, 388 Mass. 255, 261 (1983), was that\ncounsel was not guaranteed for every defendant seeking to file a\nmotion for a new trial, but that provision of counsel to\n\f                                                                   26\n\n\nSee also Reporter's Notes to Rule 30 (c) (5), Mass. Rules of\n\nCourt, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 223 (Thomson Reuters\n\n2014) (discussing 2001 amendments to rule 30 allowing judges\n\ndiscretion to authorize costs for indigent defendants pursuing\n\npostconviction procedures).\n\n    Because the postconviction proceeding at issue here, a\n\nparole hearing for a juvenile homicide offender, is required in\n\norder to ensure that an offender's life sentence conforms to the\n\nproportionality requirements of art. 26, the proceeding is not\n\navailable solely at the discretion of the State.   Rather, it is\n\nconstitutionally mandated, and as such, it requires certain\n\nprotections not guaranteed in all postconviction procedures.     It\n\nis appropriate, therefore, to construe G. L. c. 261, §§ 27A–27G,\n\nto authorize a Superior Court judge, upon motion of a parole-\n\neligible, indigent juvenile homicide offender, to allow for the\n\n\n\nindigent defendants was within the discretion of the motion\njudge. See post at     . While that is true, Conceicao\nemphasized that because \"a State has no obligation to provide a\nprocedure enabling defendants to make motions for a new trial,\nit need not place poor and wealthy defendants on an absolutely\nequal level in terms of the services available to them in\npursuing a motion for a new trial.\" Conceicao, supra. Since\nart. 26 requires that juvenile homicide offenders have a\nmeaningful opportunity for release through parole, that\nreasoning does not apply here. Rather, we cite Conceicao and\nReporter's Notes to Rule 30 (c) (5), Mass. Rules of Court, Rules\nof Criminal Procedure, at 223 (Thomson Reuters 2014), for the\npremise that judges have discretion to authorize costs to\ndefendants when necessary to guarantee meaningful access to\npostconviction procedures.\n\f                                                                   27\n\n\npayment of fees to an expert witness to assist the offender in\n\nconnection with his or her initial parole proceeding in certain\n\nlimited contexts -- specifically, where it is shown that the\n\njuvenile offender requires an expert's assistance in order\n\neffectively to explain the effects of the individual's\n\nneurobiological immaturity and other personal circumstances at\n\nthe time of the crime, and how this information relates to the\n\nindividual's present capacity and future risk of reoffending.\n\nThe judge may exercise discretion to do so when the judge\n\nconcludes that the assistance of the expert is reasonably\n\nnecessary to protect the juvenile homicide offender's meaningful\n\nopportunity for release.28\n\n     c.   Availability of judicial review.   The third reported\n\nquestion asks whether there must be an opportunity for judicial\n\nreview of a decision denying parole to a juvenile homicide\n\noffender and, if so, what form judicial review will take.    The\n\nboard, the commissioner, and the district attorney argue that\n\nart. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights prohibits\n\njudicial review in this context.   Article 30 requires strict\n\nseparation of judicial and executive powers, and the power to\n\n\n     28\n       We request this court's standing advisory committee on\nthe rules of criminal procedure to propose a procedure that will\npermit an indigent juvenile homicide offender to seek funds for\nan expert witness or witnesses to support the offender's\nrequests for parole, consistent with this opinion.\n\f                                                                    28\n\n\ngrant parole, being fundamentally related to the execution of a\n\nprisoner's sentence, lies exclusively within the province of the\n\nexecutive branch.   See Cole, 468 Mass. at 302-303; Commonwealth\n\nv. Amirault, 415 Mass. 112, 116-117 (1993).     However, as we have\n\nnoted, the right of the executive branch to exercise this power\n\nwithout intervention from the judiciary is subject to the\n\nprovision that the power must be \"constitutionally exercised.\"\n\nSee Cole, supra at 302.   This is not to suggest that the board\n\nis unconstitutionally exercising this power currently,29 or is\n\nlikely to do so in the future, but only that this court retains\n\nthe responsibility with respect to parole hearings to ensure\n\nthat any constitutional requirements are met.    Thus, this court\n\nhas never held that art. 30 precludes any type of judicial\n\nreview of parole board decisions.   In fact, Massachusetts courts\n\nhave engaged in limited review of parole proceedings,\n\nconsistently if not frequently.   See, e.g., Quegan, 423 Mass. at\n\n835 (prisoner sought declaration that board may not consider\n\nrefusal to admit guilt in parole determination); Greenman, 405\n\nMass. at 386 (prisoner challenged basis of parole denial as\n\nbeyond board's statutory authority); Blake v. Massachusetts\n\nParole Bd., 369 Mass. 701, 702 (1976) (prisoner sought\n\n\n     29\n       We agree with Justice Cordy's dissent that there is no\n\"hint\" in this record that the board is exercising its authority\nin an unconstitutional manner. See post at     .\n\f                                                                  29\n\n\ndeclaration of right to appear personally before board in order\n\nto argue for early parole eligibility); Doucette v.\n\nMassachusetts Parole Bd., 86 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 532 (2014)\n\n(prisoner pursued civil rights claim alleging violation of due\n\nprocess in parole revocation proceeding as well as certiorari\n\naction challenging merits of board's decision to revoke\n\nparole).30,31\n\n     As previously stated, the parole hearing acquires a\n\nconstitutional dimension for a juvenile homicide offender\n\nbecause the availability of a meaningful opportunity for release\n\non parole is what makes the juvenile's mandatory life sentence\n\nconstitutionally proportionate.   In this particular context,\n\njudicial review of a parole decision is available solely to\n\n     30\n       It bears noting that courts frequently rule on certiorari\npetitions by prisoners claiming that the Department of\nCorrection (department) has violated their constitutional\nrights. See, e.g., Ciampi v. Commissioner of Correction, 452\nMass. 162, 163 (2008); Puleio v. Commissioner of Correction, 52\nMass. App. Ct. 302, 305-306 (2001); Drayton v. Commissioner of\nCorrection, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 135, 135-137 (2001). The board is\nlocated within the department (although not subject to its\njurisdiction). See G. L. c. 27, § 4. Given this, it is\ndifficult to accept the proposition that actions of the\ndepartment are subject to judicial review to assure compliance\nwith the Federal and State Constitutions, but that art. 30\nprohibits any form of judicial review of decisions of the board.\n     31\n       The chair of the board and the commissioner point out\nthat a judge may not \"revise or revoke sentences when the parole\nboard does not act in accordance with a judge's expectations.\"\nSee Commonwealth v. Amirault, 415 Mass. 112, 116 (1993). We\nagree, and we do not suggest anything to the contrary in this\ncase.\n\f                                                                   30\n\n\nensure that the board exercises its discretionary authority to\n\nmake a parole decision for a juvenile homicide offender in a\n\nconstitutional manner, meaning that the art. 26 right of a\n\njuvenile homicide offender to a constitutionally proportionate\n\nsentence is not violated.32\n\n       That being said, the art. 26 right of a juvenile homicide\n\noffender in relation to parole is limited.    To repeat:   it is\n\nnot a guarantee of eventual release, but an entitlement to a\n\nmeaningful opportunity for such release based on demonstrated\n\nmaturity and rehabilitation.    See Diatchenko I, 466 Mass. at\n\n674.    That entitlement arises directly from the recognition that\n\n\n       32\n       In light of Diatchenko I, the board has adopted\nguidelines for parole determinations for juvenile homicide\noffenders serving life sentences, and these guidelines take into\naccount the unique characteristics of youth. See Massachusetts\nParole Board, Guidelines for Life Sentence Decisions (updated\nMar. 3, 2014), available at http://www.mass.gov/eopss/agencies/\nparole-board/guidelines-for-life-sentence-decisions.html\n[http://perma.cc/K33Z-YSEA]. The board is to be commended for\ndoing so, but its adoption of guidelines does not preclude or\nrender unnecessary the need for judicial review. The guidelines\nare not binding and are subject to change. More importantly,\nthe board is not in a position to make a determination that the\nart. 26 right of a juvenile homicide offender to a proportionate\nsentence has been protected.\n\n     Nor does the existence of appeal procedures before the\nboard adequately protect this right. The board's regulations\npermit inmates denied parole to request an appeal before the\nsame hearing panel that rendered the initial denial, or to\nrequest reconsideration by a staff member of the board. See 120\nCode Mass. Regs. §§ 100.00, 304.1 (2001). Neither of these\nprocesses provides the same opportunity for review by a neutral\ndecision maker that judicial review affords.\n\f                                                                     31\n\n\nchildren are constitutionally different from adults, with\n\n\"diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform,\"\n\nMiller, 132 S. Ct. at 2464, based on their \"distinctive\n\nattributes\" of youth.   See Diatchenko I, supra at 660, 671.\n\nThese include children's \"lack of maturity and an underdeveloped\n\nsense of responsibility, leading to recklessness, impulsivity,\n\nand heedless risk-taking\"; vulnerability \"to negative influences\n\nand outside pressures, including from their family and peers;\n\n. . . limited contro[l] over their own environment[;] . . .\n\n[lack of] the ability to extricate themselves from horrific,\n\ncrime-producing settings\"; and unique capacity to change as they\n\ngrow older (citations and quotations omitted).    Id. at 660.\n\nAbsent consideration of these attributes, a juvenile homicide\n\noffender may not be permitted a real chance to demonstrate\n\nmaturity and rehabilitation.   See id. at 675 (Lenk, J.,\n\nconcurring), citing Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2468.    The purpose of\n\njudicial review here is not to substitute a judge's or an\n\nappellate court's opinion for the board's judgment on whether a\n\nparticular juvenile homicide offender merits parole, because\n\nthis would usurp impermissibly the role of the board.      Rather,\n\njudicial review is limited to the question whether the board has\n\ncarried out its responsibility to take into account the\n\nattributes or factors just described in making its decision.\n\f                                                                    32\n\n\n    With this in mind, we consider the form of judicial review\n\nof a board decision denying initial parole to a juvenile\n\nhomicide offender.   Diatchenko and Roberio suggest that judicial\n\nreview in this context should be in the nature of certiorari, as\n\ndescribed in G. L. c. 249, § 4, rather than through an action\n\nfor declaratory relief under G. L. c. 231A.    We agree that\n\ncertiorari is appropriate here, although we do not agree with\n\ntheir view of the scope or standard of that review.\n\n    \"[A] complaint for declaratory relief is an appropriate way\n\nof testing the validity of regulations or the propriety of\n\npractices involving violations of rights, which are consistent\n\nand repeated in nature. . . .   It is not, however, an\n\nappropriate remedy where the validity of an adjudication . . .\n\nin an individual case is being challenged.    There relief in the\n\nnature of certiorari is to be sought.\"   (Citation omitted.)\n\nAverett v. Commissioner of Correction, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 280,\n\n287 (1988), S.C., Averett, petitioner, 404 Mass. 28 (1989).     See\n\nGrady v. Commissioner of Correction, 83 Mass. App. Ct. 126, 135-\n\n136 (2013).   As discussed, the type of limited judicial review\n\ncontemplated would focus on the parole determinations relating\n\nto a particular juvenile homicide offender.   It thus falls into\n\nthe category of cases appropriate for certiorari review.\n\n    The standard of review to be applied is a separate\n\nquestion, because the \"standard of review for an action in the\n\f                                                                      33\n\n\nnature of certiorari depends on 'the nature of the action sought\n\nto be reviewed.'\"     Rivas v. Chelsea Hous. Auth., 464 Mass. 329,\n\n334 (2013), quoting Black Rose, Inc. v. Boston, 433 Mass. 501,\n\n503 (2001).   See G. L. c. 249, § 4.    Because the decision\n\nwhether to grant parole to a particular juvenile homicide\n\noffender is a discretionary determination by the board, see\n\nCole, 468 Mass. at 302; G. L. c. 127, § 130, an abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard is appropriate.    See Forsyth Sch. for Dental\n\nHygienists v. Board of Registration in Dentistry, 404 Mass. 211,\n\n217 (1989) (review of discretionary administration or decision\n\nin certiorari action limited to whether act or decision was\n\n\"arbitrary and capricious\"); Doucette, 86 Mass. App. Ct. at 541.\n\nSee generally L.L. v. Commonwealth, 470 Mass. 169, 185 n.27\n\n(2014).   The question for the reviewing judge will be whether\n\nthe board abused its discretion in the manner in which it\n\nconsidered and dealt with \"the distinctive attributes of youth\n\n[that] diminish the penological justifications for imposing the\n\nharshest sentences on juvenile offenders,\" as they relate to the\n\nparticular circumstances of the juvenile homicide offender\n\nseeking parole.     Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2465.   Accord Diatchenko\n\nI, 466 Mass. at 671.     In this context, a denial of a parole\n\napplication by the board will constitute an abuse of discretion\n\nonly if the board essentially failed to take these factors into\n\naccount, or did so in a cursory way.     A judge may not reverse a\n\f                                                                  34\n\n\ndecision by the board denying a juvenile homicide offender\n\nparole and require that parole be granted.   Rather, if the judge\n\nconcludes that the board's consideration of the juvenile\n\noffender's status as a juvenile and the distinctive attributes\n\nof his or her youth did constitute an abuse of discretion -- was\n\narbitrary and capricious -- a remand to the board for rehearing\n\nwould be appropriate.33\n\n     It remains for us to address Diatchenko's argument that\n\njuvenile homicide offenders seeking review of a parole denial\n\nshould be able to bring an action for certiorari to a single\n\njustice of this court as a matter of course.   Although this\n\ncourt and the Superior Court have concurrent jurisdiction to\n\nentertain actions in the nature of certiorari under G. L.\n\nc. 249, § 4, as with most original actions for certiorari, these\n\nactions are most appropriately brought in the Superior Court.\n\n     Finally, we summarize the scope of our opinion in this\n\ncase, and clarify what the opinion does not say.   First, we\n\n\n     33\n       Justice Spina, in his dissent, expresses concern that\nwithout the affirmative power to grant parole after a denial by\nthe board, this limited form of judicial review has the\npotential to result in an endless cycle of board hearings and\nactions for certiorari, until the board ultimately grants\nparole. See post at     . This outcome is unlikely. Given the\nlimited scope of judicial review in this context, and the\ndeference that must be afforded to the board, we think decisions\nto vacate a parole denial will be rare; moreover, should that\noccur, we assume that at a new hearing, the board will remedy\nthe error or errors that caused the matter to be remanded.\n\f                                                                   35\n\n\nconsider here only the initial parole hearing available to\n\njuvenile homicide offenders.   For the reasons discussed supra,\n\nthe procedural protections of representation by counsel and the\n\nopportunity to obtain expert assistance in connection with that\n\ninitial parole hearing are necessary for such offenders in light\n\nof their mandatory life sentences and the constitutional\n\nrequirement of proportionality in sentencing.   See Diatchenko I,\n\n466 Mass. at 669-671; id. at 675 (Lenk, J., concurring).      In\n\nCommonwealth v. Okoro, post      ,     (2015), also decided\n\ntoday, and for the same reasons, we afford the same procedural\n\nprotections to juvenile offenders convicted of murder in the\n\nsecond degree, who also are subject to mandatory life sentences\n\nwith eligibility for parole.   Nothing in this opinion, however,\n\nis intended to suggest that any other class of offenders is also\n\nentitled to these protections in connection with the parole\n\nhearing process.\n\n    Second, in affording juvenile homicide offenders the\n\nprocedural protections at issue here, we emphasize that the\n\ndetermination whether to grant a parole application of an\n\nindividual juvenile homicide offender is, and remains, a\n\ndiscretionary decision for the board to make.   As previously\n\nnoted, that standard is governed by G. L. c. 127, § 130, which\n\nprohibits a prisoner from receiving parole unless the board\n\nconcludes that if the prisoner is released, \"the prisoner will\n\f                                                                     36\n\n\nlive and remain at liberty without violating the law and that\n\nrelease is not incompatible with the welfare of society.\"\n\n     Third, and relatedly, the board remains fully authorized to\n\ndetermine, consistent with legislative mandates,34 the rules and\n\nprocedures it deems appropriate for the conduct of its parole\n\nhearings, and free to reach whatever decision in each case it\n\ndeems appropriate.    The dissents suggest that in establishing\n\nminimal requirements of due process for juvenile homicide\n\noffenders in their parole hearings, the court interferes\n\nunnecessarily and improperly with the operations of the parole\n\nboard, an executive agency, trenching on principles of\n\nseparation of powers.    Post at    ,    .   Our decision does not\n\ncommit this offense.    Insofar as we conclude that the provision\n\nof counsel and of funds for expert witnesses is required for\n\njuvenile homicide offenders, these are procedures whose sole\n\npurpose is to protect the constitutional entitlement that these\n\njuvenile offenders have to a meaningful opportunity for parole\n\nrelease.35    Finally, the limited judicial review provided here\n\ndoes not authorize judges to substitute their judgment with\n\nrespect to the parole release decision for the board's.     As\n\n     34\n          See, e.g., G. L. c. 127, §§ 130, 133A.\n     35\n       As we have noted, see note 17, supra, the chair of the\nboard and the commissioner recognize \"certain benefits\nflow[ing]\" from these procedures, and do not view them as\ninterfering with the board's authority.\n\f                                                                  37\n\n\ndiscussed, the judiciary's only role in these cases will be to\n\nensure that the board's determination whether to grant or deny\n\nparole to a juvenile homicide offender is \"constitutionally\n\nexercised,\" Cole, 468 Mass. at 302, in the sense that the board\n\nproperly has taken into account the offender's status as a child\n\nwhen the crime was committed.\n\n    4.   Applicability of this decision.    Diatchenko and Roberio\n\nappear to confine their requests to the limited group of\n\nindividuals who were convicted of murder in the first degree and\n\nsentenced to mandatory life without parole prior to the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Miller, and who became eligible for parole\n\npursuant to this court's decision in Diatchenko I.    We do not\n\nshare the view that the decision in this case applies only to\n\nthat limited group.    Rather, it applies more generally to all\n\njuvenile offenders convicted of murder.\n\n    5.   Conclusion.    The matter is remanded to the county\n\ncourt, where the single justice will enter a judgment consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n                                     So ordered.\n\f    SPINA, J. (dissenting, with whom Cordy, J., joins).     I\n\nrespectfully dissent from the decision of the court today.      The\n\ncourt has misconstrued Diatchenko v. District Attorney for the\n\nSuffolk Dist., 466 Mass. 655, 674 (2013) (Diatchenko I), which\n\nrequired only a \"meaningful opportunity to obtain release\" in\n\nthe form of a parole hearing for juveniles convicted of murder\n\nin the first degree.   The court instead has created a path by\n\nwhich such an offender may obtain, as of right, access to\n\ncounsel, funds for expert witnesses, and, if denied parole,\n\njudicial review of the decision of the parole board (board).\n\nThe solution at which the court arrives today ignores previous\n\nstatements of the law on this matter.    Our decision in\n\nDiatchenko I did not create a significant liberty interest in\n\nthe outcome of the parole hearing.    Diatchenko I stood solely\n\nfor the proposition that the exception to parole eligibility in\n\nG. L. c. 127, § 133A, no longer applies to Gregory Diatchenko\n\nand Jeffrey S. Roberio and left the remainder of the statutory\n\nscheme unchanged.   That statutory scheme continues to apply\n\nunaltered to them and similarly situated inmates.\n\n    1.   Meaningful opportunity.     In Diatchenko I, we addressed\n\nthe United States Supreme Court's holding in Miller v. Alabama,\n\n132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), that juveniles convicted of murder in\n\nthe first degree could no longer receive life sentences without\n\f                                                                      2\n\n\nthe possibility of parole unless a court determined they were\n\nincorrigible.   We adopted the language in Miller, first\n\nexpressed in Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 75 (2010), that a\n\njuvenile offender receiving a life sentence must receive \"some\n\nmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated\n\nmaturity and rehabilitation.\"    Inherent in this line of cases is\n\nthe judicial recognition that \"children are constitutionally\n\ndifferent from adults for purposes of sentencing.\"    Diatchenko\n\nI, 466 Mass. at 670, quoting Miller, supra at 2464.     The Supreme\n\nCourt reasoned that a sentence of life in prison without the\n\npossibility of parole removes any penological justification for\n\nthe sentence because it \"forswears altogether the rehabilitative\n\nideal.\"   Graham, supra at 74.\n\n     The court says \"the meaningful opportunity for release\n\nthrough parole is necessary in order to conform the juvenile\n\nhomicide offender's mandatory life sentence to the requirements\n\nof art. 26 [of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights].\"     Ante\n\nat    .   I agree.   After Diatchenko I, a juvenile convicted of\n\nmurder in the first degree, like every juvenile who is sentenced\n\nto incarceration, is eligible for parole, whereas before such a\n\njuvenile was not.    The thrust of Diatchenko I was an expectation\n\nof parole eligibility, and no more.\n\n     The court improperly synthesizes two premises to arrive at\n\na more significant but now constitutionally untenable\n\f                                                                      3\n\n\nconclusion.     The court correctly recognizes that (1) children\n\nare \"constitutionally different from adults for purposes of\n\nsentencing\" and (2) that a life sentence for a juvenile\n\nconvicted of murder in the first degree is cruel and unusual\n\nunder art. 26 without a meaningful opportunity for release\n\nthrough a demonstration of rehabilitation.       Fusing these\n\npropositions together, the court concludes that the \"meaningful\n\nopportunity\" for release for juveniles convicted of murder in\n\nthe first degree has a \"constitutional dimension\" that exists\n\nfor no others and requires \"additional procedural protections.\"\n\nAnte at      & n.14.   This conclusion is erroneous because the\n\ncourt applies the first premise to the second when, in fact, the\n\nsecond premise flows from the first.\n\n    The court states that other sentences, except life\n\nsentences for juveniles convicted of murder in the first degree,\n\n\"include parole eligibility.\"     Ante at    .    The opposite is\n\ntrue.     Parole is an executive action separate and distinct from\n\na judicial sentence.     See Commonwealth v. Cole, 468 Mass. 294,\n\n302 (2014) (\"[The granting of parole] is a function of the\n\nexecutive branch of government with which, if otherwise\n\nconstitutionally exercised, the judiciary may not interfere\").\n\nCf. Simms v. State, 65 Md. App. 685, 689 (1986) (\"A parole is an\n\nact of executive clemency.     It does not involve the sentencing\n\nfunction or any other judicial function\").       Cf. also Knight v.\n\f                                                                    4\n\n\nUnited States, 73 F.3d 117, 119 (7th Cir. 1995), cert. denied,\n\n519 U.S. 827 (1996) (\"Parole is an extension of the\n\n[c]onstitutional grant of clemency power given to the\n\nPresident\"); State v. Hewett, 270 N.C. 348, 352 (1967)\n\n(\"Probation relates to judicial action taken before the prison\n\ndoor is closed, whereas parole relates to executive action taken\n\nafter the door has closed on a convict\").   Were Massachusetts to\n\nabandon its system of parole, art. 26 would only require that\n\njuveniles convicted of murder in the first degree -- and thus\n\nsentenced to life -- be afforded some opportunity for release\n\nfrom imprisonment through a demonstration of rehabilitation, the\n\nonly constitutionally available penological justification for\n\nthe State's harshest penalty.   Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2468 (\"this\n\nmandatory punishment [of life without parole] disregards the\n\npossibility of rehabilitation even when the circumstances most\n\nsuggest it\").   In such a hypothetical scenario, art. 26 would\n\nnot require parole for any juvenile sentenced to a term of years\n\nbecause that sentence -- or any other lesser sentence -- has a\n\npenological justification other than rehabilitation.    See id. at\n\n2465-2466 (outlining penological justifications of sentences as\n\napplied to juveniles).\n\n    In constitutionally guaranteeing that juveniles convicted\n\nof murder in the first degree are eligible for parole, we have\n\nalready previously respected juveniles' constitutional\n\f                                                                        5\n\n\ndistinctiveness from adults convicted of murder in the first\n\ndegree by the imposition of a sentence that is not cruel and\n\nunusual.   By imposing today these additional procedural\n\nprotections, the court reaches beyond the judicial function of\n\nsentencing to regulate the conduct of the initial parole hearing\n\nitself, the manifestation of the executive prerogative to\n\nexecute the sentence.    In so doing, the court transforms the\n\nconduct of the parole hearing into part of the sentencing\n\nprocess, at least for juveniles convicted of murder in the first\n\ndegree, and implicates the action of the board in the sentence\n\nitself.\n\n    The Legislature never intended such a relationship between\n\nsentence and parole.    Moreover, it is something that we\n\nexpressly said in Cole, 468 Mass. at 302, is forbidden, because\n\nsentencing is \"a quintessential judicial power.\"    Id., quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Rodriguez, 461 Mass. 256, 264 (2012).       In Cole,\n\nwe held that the executive branch's imposition of punishments\n\nunder G. L. c. 127, § 133D (c), against those who violated\n\ncommunity parole supervision for life improperly interfered with\n\nthe judicial power to impose a sentence.    Cole, supra.     Today we\n\nare dealing with the opposite scenario, in which the court\n\nsubsumes the executive power to regulate the conduct of a parole\n\nhearing into part of the sentencing process.\n\f                                                                      6\n\n\n    If the court's decision should be considered not to have\n\nrendered the conduct of the initial parole hearing of a juvenile\n\nconvicted of murder in the first degree part of the sentencing\n\nprocess, then the court's justification for \"additional\n\nprocedural protections\" in such a hearing fails because\n\n\"children are constitutionally different from adults for\n\npurposes of sentencing\" (emphasis added).      Diatchenko I, 466\n\nMass. at 670, quoting Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2465.     Parole is not\n\npart of the sentencing process and thus the parole hearing need\n\nnot recognize the difference between children and adults for\n\npurposes of art. 26.\n\n    The Supreme Court specifically identified traditional\n\nparole hearings as capable of providing that \"meaningful\n\nopportunity to obtain release.\"     Graham, 560 U.S. at 75.   In\n\nboth Graham and Miller, the Court even went so far as to\n\nexplicitly state that \"a State is not required to guarantee\n\neventual freedom.\"     Miller 132 S. Ct. at 2469; Graham, supra.\n\nThe term \"meaningful opportunity\" was a warning that the Eighth\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution \"forbid[s] States\n\nfrom making the judgment at the outset that those offenders\n\nnever will be fit to reenter society\" (emphasis added).       Graham,\n\nsupra.   \"The Eighth Amendment does not foreclose the possibility\n\nthat [a juvenile convicted of murder in the first degree] will\n\nremain behind bars for life.\"     Id.   Read together these cases\n\f                                                                   7\n\n\nstand for the proposition that Diatchenko and Roberio, and\n\nsimilarly situated inmates, must be afforded a standard parole\n\nhearing, and by implication, this hearing will provide these\n\nindividuals with the \"meaningful opportunity\" of release.\n\n    This warning is in congruence with the Court's previous\n\nstatements that \"no constitutional or inherent right of a\n\nconvicted person to be conditionally released before the\n\nexpiration of a valid sentence\" exists.   Greenholtz v. Inmates\n\nof the Neb. Penal & Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 7 (1979).\n\nAccord Quegan v. Massachusetts Parole Bd., 423 Mass. 834, 836\n\n(1996).   Indeed, in Diatchenko I we recognized that \"[o]ur\n\ndecision should not be construed to suggest that individuals who\n\nare under the age of eighteen when they commit murder in the\n\nfirst degree necessarily should be paroled once they have served\n\na statutorily designated portion of their sentences.\"\n\nDiatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 674.   These statements cannot be\n\nreconciled with the court's reasoning today that the \"process\"\n\nof the initial parole hearing of a juvenile convicted of murder\n\nin the first degree \"takes on a different constitutional\n\ndimension that does not exist for other offenders whose\n\nsentences include parole eligibility.\"    Ante at    .\n\n    Absent the recognition of a new liberty interest in the\n\noutcome of parole, the court does not explain the constitutional\n\nnecessity of these additional protections but simply inserts a\n\f                                                                     8\n\n\nnew \"constitutional dimension.\"    This \"constitutional dimension\"\n\nidentified by the court is the foundation for the new\n\nconstitutional rule that juveniles convicted of murder in the\n\nfirst degree require different procedural protections from those\n\ngiven to other offenders.   The court provides juveniles under a\n\nmandatory life sentences with enhanced procedures that no others\n\nreceive, yet there has been no suggestion that the parole\n\nhearing others receive falls short of a meaningful opportunity.\n\nWe have never previously stated or hinted at such a difference\n\nin procedural safeguards.   In Diatchenko I, we determined that\n\nthe appropriate remedy to the defendant's challenge under Miller\n\nwas to leave intact as much of the statutory scheme designed by\n\nthe Legislature as possible, so far as it remained\n\nconstitutional.   Diatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 673.    Accordingly,\n\nwe struck down only the provision making juveniles ineligible\n\nfor parole and let the remaining provisions of the statute\n\nstand.   Id.   In Commonwealth v. Brown, 466 Mass. 676 (2013), and\n\nCommonwealth v. Ray, 467 Mass. 115 (2014), we affirmed our\n\nintent to interfere with the enacted legislation as little as\n\npossible and do nothing more than invalidate the exception for\n\nparole eligibility.\n\n    In Brown, this court held that the rules of severability\n\nrequire trial judges to apply the parole statute as written with\n\nthe exclusion of the one unconstitutional provision.     Brown, 466\n\f                                                                      9\n\n\nMass. at 680.   In so doing, this court upheld the trial judge's\n\ndecision to impose \"as much of the sentencing scheme set forth\n\nin [the statute] as would be permissible in light of Miller's\n\nprohibition against mandatory sentences of life without parole\n\nfor juveniles.\"     Id.   We would not have instructed trial judges\n\nto apply the statute in a manner that preserved as much of the\n\nexpressed intent of the Legislature as possible if we intended\n\nto create a process different from that provided for in the\n\nthen-existing statutory scheme.\n\n    More recently, in Ray, we expressed a view that the normal\n\nprocedures governing consideration of parole release would apply\n\nto juveniles convicted of murder in the first degree.      Ray, 467\n\nMass. at 139-140.    \"Pursuant to our holding in Diatchenko, . . .\n\nthe defendant's life sentence remains in force, but the\n\nexception in G. L. c. 265, § 2, rendering him ineligible for\n\nparole, no longer applies.     The defendant is eligible for parole\n\nin accordance with the terms of G. L. c. 127, § 133A.\"        Id.   See\n\nCommonwealth v. Keo, 467 Mass. 25, 47 (2014) (\"the lesser\n\npunishment under G. L. c. 265, § 2, of mandatory life in prison\n\nwith the possibility of parole, set pursuant to the parole\n\neligibility statute in effect at the time of the juvenile\n\noffender's crime, would apply\").     This language strongly\n\nsuggests that the court intended for the remainder of the\n\nstatutory scheme to apply to Diatchenko and Roberio and that\n\f                                                                   10\n\n\nthey are entitled only to the same parole hearing process as\n\nother inmates.\n\n    Undoubtedly, Diatchenko and Roberio have a right to a\n\n\"hearing that shall afford [them] a meaningful opportunity to\n\nobtain release,\" Diatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 674, but only via\n\nthe same processes and established procedures that all other\n\ninmates serving life sentences have, and not through a new\n\nliberty interest in parole with accompanying greater\n\nconstitutional protections.   The court today seemingly \"ignores\n\nthe distinction, adopted by the Supreme Court, between\n\n[potentially] being deprived of a liberty that one already has\n\nand being denied a conditional liberty that one desires.\"\n\nGreenman v. Massachusetts Parole Bd., 405 Mass. 384, 388 n.3\n\n(1989).\n\n    Moreover, in Diatchenko I, we outlined the process\n\nnecessary to afford a juvenile convicted of murder in the first\n\ndegree such a \"meaningful opportunity,\" saying only that\n\n    \"it is the purview of the Massachusetts parole board to\n    evaluate the circumstances surrounding the commission of\n    the crime, including the age of the offender, together with\n    all relevant information pertaining to the offender's\n    character and actions during the intervening years since\n    conviction. By this process, a juvenile homicide offender\n    will be afforded a meaningful opportunity to be considered\n    for parole suitability.\"\n\f                                                                   11\n\n\n466 Mass. at 674.1   We did not hold that the Massachusetts\n\nConstitution requires a new kind of parole hearing; and we said\n\nnothing about changing the standard process in any respect (much\n\nless requiring appointed counsel or granting funds for expert\n\ntestimony) in order for the juvenile offender to obtain his\n\n\"meaningful opportunity.\"   Instead, we said that a process that\n\nconsiders the above mentioned factors provides juvenile\n\noffenders with a \"meaningful opportunity to obtain release.\"\n\n     This understanding is in line with decisions of\n\nMassachusetts and Federal courts that have long held that the\n\npossible release arising under the parole statute does not\n\ncreate a liberty interest in parole.   See Greenman, 405 Mass. at\n\n388 n.3 (\"The individual characteristics of the Massachusetts\n\nstatutory parole scheme do not give rise to a liberty interest\n\nunder Federal law\").   See also Doe v. Massachusetts Parole Bd.,\n\n82 Mass. App. Ct. 851, 858 (2012) (\"A prisoner in the\n\nCommonwealth does not have a liberty interest in the future\n\n\n     1\n       The parole board (board) updated its \"Guidelines for Life\nSentence Decisions,\" available at http://www.mass.gov/eopss/\nagencies/parole-board/guidelines-for-life-sentence-\ndecisions.html [http://perma.cc/K33ZYSEA], most recently on\nMarch 3, 2014. These guidelines reflect the mandates of our\ndecision in Diatchenko v. District Attorney for the Suffolk\nDist., 466 Mass. 655 (2013) (Diatchenko I), specifically\nproviding that \"an inmate who committed the offense as a\njuvenile will be evaluated with recognition of the distinctive\nattributes of youth, including immaturity, impetuosity, and a\nfailure to appreciate risks and consequences.\"\n\f                                                                   12\n\n\ngrant of parole\"); Lynch v. Hubbard, 47 F. Supp. 2d 125, 127-128\n\n(D. Mass. 1999) (Massachusetts parole statute's negative\n\nphrasing prevents an expectation or presumption of release).\n\nEssentially, under G. L. c. 127, § 133A, Diatchenko and Roberio\n\ndo not have an expectation or presumption of release and\n\nDiatchenko I did nothing to overtly change the statutory scheme.\n\nIf we had intended to create an entirely new liberty interest in\n\nparole where there had been none previously, we would have\n\nexplicitly said so.    We did not, and Diatchenko I did not create\n\na liberty interest in parole for juveniles convicted of murder\n\nin the first degree.\n\n    2.   Right to counsel.    The court concludes that juveniles\n\nconvicted of murder in the first degree who seek parole\n\nconstitutionally are entitled to representation by counsel\n\nbecause a parole hearing is a contested, complex proceeding\n\nsimilar to that involving the termination of parental rights.\n\nTherefore, because juveniles convicted of murder in the first\n\ndegree -- imprisoned at a young age -- are unlikely to advocate\n\nas fully as possible for themselves and a parole hearing is\n\nsimilar to a proceeding terminating parental rights, the court\n\nconcludes that constitutionally guaranteed access to counsel\n\nbest ensures that the parole hearing is a \"meaningful\n\nopportunity.\"   I disagree.\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\n     The court's analogy between parental right termination\n\nproceedings and parole hearings does not withstand closer\n\nscrutiny.   The proceedings we examined in Department of Pub.\n\nWelfare v. J.K.B., 379 Mass. 1 (1979), can result in the loss of\n\nrights to conceive and raise one's children -- rights that are\n\n\"essential . . . basic civil rights of man . . . far more\n\nprecious . . . than property rights.\"    Id. at 3, quoting Stanley\n\nv. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972).   In J.K.B., supra at 4,\n\nwe affirmed that one cannot lose a right without due process,\n\nand we ensured that due process be observed by access to counsel\n\nfor indigent parents.   Parole hearings, however, do not result\n\nin the loss of any rights.   As explained above, an expectation\n\nof parole simply does not exist in these proceedings and our\n\ndecision in Diatchenko I has not changed that fact.2   Without an\n\n\n     2\n       The court's acknowledgment that Quegan v. Massachusetts\nParole Bd., 423 Mass. 834, 840 (1996), contradicts its proposed\nfunding mechanism and its rationalization that a juvenile\nconvicted of murder in the first degree is entitled to\nrepresentation \"thus required by law\" stems from characterizing\nthe plaintiff in Quegan as \"a prisoner seeking parole who had no\nconstitutionally protected interest that entitled him to any due\nprocess protections.\" Ante at     n.20. The only reason Quegan\ncontradicts the court's conclusion that G. L. c. 211D, § 5, is\nthe appropriate authorization mechanism is because the court\nbaldly asserts that the class of inmates at issue requires a\ndifferent sort of parole hearing with additional procedural\nprotections from a hearing available to any other class applying\nfor parole. Juveniles convicted of murder in the first degree\ndo not merit anything more than a chance to appear before the\nboard in the same manner as other inmates do. To grant them\ngreater protection creates a perverse incentive.\n\f                                                                  14\n\n\nexpectation of parole, a juvenile convicted of murder in the\n\nfirst degree has no protected liberty interest, or right, to\n\nlose.3\n\n     Our decision in Diatchenko I did not suggest that the\n\ncurrent parole process did not adequately provide a \"meaningful\n\nopportunity to obtain release.\"   We most certainly did not\n\nsuggest that publicly funded counsel is necessary to protect\n\none's interest in a fair hearing.   The right to counsel based in\n\nthe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art.\n\n12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights does not\n\ntraditionally have an application to parole hearings.    The\n\nUnited States Supreme Court explicitly noted that the right to\n\ncounsel does not extend to postconviction collateral\n\nproceedings, see Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 356\n\n(1963), and that \"[i]n the context of parole . . . the\n\nprocedures required are minimal.\"   Swarthout v. Cooke, 131 S.\n\nCt. 859, 862 (2011).\n\n\n\n     3\n       We also consistently have held in our cases dealing with\npostconviction rights in other contexts that a defendant is not\nentitled to a full array of due process. See Commonwealth v.\nArriaga, 438 Mass. 556, 569 (2003) (no right to public funds to\nobtain postconviction relief); Jackson v. Commonwealth, 430\nMass. 260, 264 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1194 (2000) (no\nabsolute right to counsel in moving for new trial); Commonwealth\nv. Conceicao, 388 Mass. 255, 263-264 (1983) (no absolute right\nto appointed counsel in obtaining postconviction relief under\nMass. R. Crim. P. 30, as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 [2001]).\n\f                                                                   15\n\n\n     We consistently have rejected claims that an inmate is\n\nentitled to counsel at parole hearings.   See Cole, 468 Mass. at\n\n306; Quegan v. Massachusetts Parole Bd., 423 Mass. 834, 840\n\n(1996) (no right to representation before board unless there is\n\nindependent and pending criminal proceeding that could be\n\naffected by parole proceedings).4   Parole is not a part of the\n\ncriminal prosecution or the adversarial process, but rather\n\narises subsequently and is supervised by an executive\n\nadministrative agency rather than the court.   Because parole is\n\nseparate and apart from criminal proceedings for those convicted\n\nof murder in the first degree as juveniles, the full breadth of\n\ndue process rights, including the right to counsel, does not\n\napply during such hearings.\n\n     Further, at this juncture, Diatchenko and Roberio have not\n\nmade a sufficient showing that the parole hearing process\n\navailable to them is inadequate or that the unique skills of a\n\nlawyer are necessary in order to have a \"meaningful opportunity\n\nto obtain release.\"   This is particularly so given that the\n\n\n     4\n       Courts in other jurisdictions similarly have rejected\nclaims that an inmate is entitled to counsel at parole release\nhearings. See Warren v. United States Parole Comm'n, 659 F.2d\n183, 195 (D.C. Cir. 1981); Holup v. Gates, 544 F.2d 82, 85 (2d\nCir. 1976); Bearden v. South Carolina, 443 F.2d 1090, 1095 (4th\nCir. 1971). Hawaii is the only State to grant a right to\ncounsel at parole release and review hearings by statute. Haw.\nRev. Stat. § 706-670(3)(b), (c). Should the Massachusetts\nLegislature take similar action, the debate here would be moot.\n\f                                                                   16\n\n\ncurrent parole process requires the board to consider the\n\ncircumstances of the crime, including whether Diatchenko and\n\nRoberio were juveniles at its commission, and whether they have\n\nbeen rehabilitated.   Additionally, numerous inmates convicted of\n\nmurder in the second degree as juveniles have been paroled after\n\nrelease hearings conducted without the aid of appointed counsel.\n\nWhile \"lifer hearings\" certainly require considerable\n\npreparation, the board is not called upon to resolve disputed\n\nissues of fact, strict rules of evidence do not apply, and\n\nwitnesses need not be subjected to cross-examination.\n\n     The court maintains that an attorney is needed to collect\n\nmaterials pertaining to a juvenile homicide offender's criminal\n\nhistory and personal development after conviction.   However, at\n\nthe time of a parole hearing, the factual record in these cases\n\nalready has been well established either in a trial transcript\n\nor in a decision of this court.   Additionally, the Department of\n\nCorrection (department) keeps a historical record containing\n\ndetailed medical, psychiatric, and disciplinary records in each\n\ninmate's six-part folder.   103 Code Mass. Regs. § 155.07 (2014).\n\nThese records are available to Diatchenko and Roberio before\n\ntheir hearings and to the board for review.5   See G. L. c. 127,\n\n\n     5\n       The court highlights that an inmate's access to this\ninformation may be restricted. Ante at     . The issue of what\nmay or may not be restricted in these circumstances is best left\n\f                                                                   17\n\n\n§ 135; 103 Code Mass. Regs. § 157.08 (2005); 120 Code Mass.\n\nRegs. § 300.05(1)(i) (1997).   Finally, and notably, the court\n\ndoes not suggest that the statutory standard for granting parole\n\nor the requirements for membership to the board are\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n    3.   Expert witness funds.   The court also concludes that a\n\nparole-eligible juvenile convicted of murder in the first degree\n\nmay petition a Superior Court judge to authorize the payment of\n\nfees to retain an expert witness to explain effectively \"the\n\neffects of the individual's neurobiological immaturity and other\n\npersonal circumstances at the time of the crime, and how this\n\ninformation relates to the individual's present capacity and\n\nfuture risk of reoffending.\"   Ante at    .   The majority derives\n\nthis right from the same mistaken interpretation that a\n\n\"meaningful opportunity\" of parole grants juveniles convicted of\n\nmurder in the first degree more rights in a parole hearing than\n\nany other class of inmate.   For substantially the same reasons\n\nthat a juvenile convicted of murder in the first degree is not\n\nguaranteed access to counsel, neither is he or she guaranteed\n\naccess to funds for expert witness testimony.\n\n\n\nto another day, but I note that the Department of Correction\nmust \"make every effort to disclose all evaluative information\nwhich is reasonably segregable from\" certain enumerated\ncategories to an inmate. 103 Code Mass. Regs. § 157.08(4)\n(2005).\n\f                                                                    18\n\n\n      The power to allocate and direct public funding among\n\ncompeting public purposes is traditionally within the purview of\n\nthe Legislature.   See Opinion of the Justices, 430 Mass. 1201,\n\n1202 (1999); County of Barnstable v. Commonwealth, 422 Mass. 33,\n\n45 (1996).   The court construes G. L. c. 261, §§ 27A-27G, as\n\nauthorizing the expenditure of public funds because the parole\n\nhearing at issue is constitutionally mandated.      Ante at    .\n\nFor support, the court cites our cases that guaranteed\n\n\"meaningful access to whatever postconviction proceedings the\n\nState makes available\" for indigent defendants who sought\n\npostconviction relief.     Ante at     , citing Commonwealth v.\n\nConceicao, 388 Mass. 255, 261-262 (1983).      At issue in Conceicao\n\nwas the question whether \"meaningful access\" included access to\n\ncounsel as of right.     Id. at 258.   We concluded that the\n\ndecision to grant access to counsel for the preparation of a\n\nmotion for a new trial was within the discretion of the motion\n\njudge.   Id. at 262.   We recommended counsel only in the event\n\nthe defendant demonstrated a colorable or meritorious issue.\n\nId.   Importantly, we recognized that not every inmate need be\n\nplaced on exactly the same footing as any other by providing\n\ncounsel in order to guarantee meaningful access.      Id. at 261.\n\n      General Laws c. 261, § 27C (4), echoes the legislative\n\nacknowledgment that \"meaningful access\" does not necessarily\n\nrequire the blanket authorization of public funds in support of\n\f                                                                      19\n\n\na defendant's efforts following his direct appeal.     This section\n\nauthorizes provision of public funds needed by an indigent\n\napplicant for an \"effective . . . prosecution, defense or\n\nappeal.\"    Yet funds under the statute are generally not\n\navailable to support a defendant's effort to obtain\n\npostconviction relief, because those proceedings are not a part\n\nof the prosecution, defense, or appeal.    See Commonwealth v.\n\nArriaga, 438 Mass. 556, 569 (2003).\n\n     Finally, according to its enabling statute, members of the\n\nboard must come from a diverse background, including the fields\n\nof psychology or psychiatry.    G. L. c. 27, § 4.   Additionally,\n\nat least one member of the board must now have experience in\n\nforensic psychology, St. 2014, c. 189 (1), and the board must\n\nconsider scientific and technical factors at its hearings.      The\n\nboard now is obligated to consider youth-related factors in\n\norder to fulfil the mandates of both Miller and Diatchenko.6\n\nThese requirements assist in ensuring that Diatchenko's and\n\nRoberio's hearings provide a truly \"meaningful opportunity\" for\n\nrelease, without a need for their own experts.\n\n     4.    Certiorari.   The court today establishes judicial\n\nreview of the denial of parole to a juvenile convicted of murder\n\nin the first degree through an action for certiorari.\n\n     6\n       As noted previously, the board has updated its guidelines\nto reflect our decision in Diatchenko I. See note 1, supra.\n\f                                                                    20\n\n\nCertiorari is available when there is \"(1) a judicial or quasi-\n\njudicial proceeding, (2) from which there is no other reasonably\n\nadequate remedy, and (3) a substantial injury or injustice\n\narising from the proceeding under review.\"     Indeck v. Clients'\n\nSec. Bd., 450 Mass. 379, 385 (2008).   Such review conflicts with\n\nour previous understanding of the separation of powers enshrined\n\nin art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.    \"The\n\ngranting of parole, or conditional release from confinement, is\n\na discretionary act of the parole board\" and \"is a function of\n\nthe executive branch of government with which, if otherwise\n\nconstitutionally exercised, the judiciary may not interfere.\"\n\nCole, 468 Mass. at 302.   See Stewart v. Commonwealth, 413 Mass.\n\n664, 669 (1992).   We previously have stated that a statute that\n\n\"impermissibly allocates a power held by only one branch to\n\nanother\" violates art. 30.   Cole, supra.    Today's holding\n\nviolates art. 30 because it permits a judge to \"nullify the\n\ndiscretionary actions of the parole board.\"     Commonwealth v.\n\nAmirault, 415 Mass. 112, 116-117 (1993).     Accord Woods v. State\n\nBd. of Parole, 351 Mass. 556, 559 (1967) (\"Even by a writ of\n\nmandamus, the board may be required merely to consider a\n\nprisoner's petition for parole.   The board may not be required\n\nto exercise any discretion for the benefit of a prisoner\").\n\n    As detailed above, Diatchenko I did not create any\n\nadditional rights for a juvenile convicted of murder in the\n\f                                                                    21\n\n\nfirst degree more expansive than those possessed by any other\n\nclass of inmate.    The use of certiorari to ensure that a parole\n\nhearing provides a \"meaningful opportunity\" for release ignores\n\nthe existence of a \"reasonably adequate remedy.\"     Indeck, 450\n\nMass. at 385.    An inmate may seek relief from decisions of the\n\nboard by means of an action for declaratory relief under G. L.\n\nc. 231A.   See Gangi v. Massachusetts Parole Bd., 468 Mass. 323,\n\n324 (2014); Massachusetts Parole Bd. v. Brusgulis, 403 Mass.\n\n1010, 1011 (1989).    Chapter 231A provides inmates with the\n\nopportunity to challenge the \"practices or procedures [of the\n\nboard] . . . alleged to be in violation of the Constitution of\n\nthe United States or of the constitution or laws of the\n\ncommonwealth.\"    G. L. c. 231A, § 2.   Accordingly, Diatchenko,\n\nRoberio, and similarly situated inmates may contest the board's\n\npractices that fail to consider the unique characteristics of\n\njuvenile offenders as well as displayed growth and change from\n\nadolescence, as required by Diatchenko I.\n\n    Certiorari is limited to correcting substantial errors of\n\nlaw that affect material rights and are apparent on the record.\n\nGloucester v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 408 Mass. 292, 297 (1990).\n\nThe only material right at stake to juveniles convicted of\n\nmurder in the first degree is the expectation of parole\n\neligibility, not the substance of the board's decision.\n\nMoreover, the use of certiorari permits the reviewing court only\n\f                                                                  22\n\n\nto affirm or set aside a decision of the tribunal whose actions\n\nare under review.   Commonwealth v. Ellis, 11 Mass. 462, 466\n\n(1814) (\"this Court . . . can only affirm the proceedings . . .\n\nor quash them\"); Commonwealth v. Blue-Hill Turnpike Corp., 5\n\nMass. 420, 423 (1809) (\"on certiorari we can enter no new\n\njudgment\"); Melvin v. Bridge, 3 Mass. 305, 306 (1807) (\"If the\n\nCourt were to consider these proceedings as certified on a\n\ncertiorari, the plaintiff in error could not be relieved, as a\n\njudgment for costs could not be rendered, but only the\n\nproceedings affirmed or quashed\").   Consequently, lacking any\n\naffirmative power, a court could only set aside a decision of\n\nthe board and then remand the matter to the board, a process\n\nthat could be repeated ad infinitum until the board grants\n\nparole.   See Woods, 351 Mass. at 559.   Not only are courts ill-\n\nequipped to decide whether parole should be granted, but such a\n\ndecision -- both historically and legally -- has been reserved\n\nfor the executive branch.\n\n     The court notes that judicial review by an action for\n\ncertiorari would not encompass whether a particular juvenile\n\nconvicted of murder in the first degree is entitled to release\n\non parole but rather would be limited to the question whether\n\nthe board has \"constitutionally exercised\" its discretion.     Ante\n\nat     n.16, citing Cole, 468 Mass. at 302.   If the reviewing\n\njudge is not concerned with the individual outcome of the matter\n\f                                                                   23\n\n\nbefore him or her, then the judge is by default only reviewing\n\nthe procedure of that matter.   \"[A] complaint for declaratory\n\nrelief is an appropriate way of testing the validity of\n\nregulations or the propriety of practices involving violations\n\nof rights, which are consistent and repeated in nature.\"      Nelson\n\nv. Commissioner of Correction, 390 Mass. 379, 388 n.12 (1983).\n\nThis mechanism has been utilized in previous challenges to the\n\nprocedures by which the board exercises its discretion.    See\n\nQuegan, 423 Mass. at 835; Blake v. Massachusetts Parole Bd., 369\n\nMass. 701, 702-703 (1976).\n\n     The court -- and Diatchenko and Roberio -- do not contend\n\nthat the board has failed in this respect such that a request\n\nfor declaratory relief is warranted at this time.   Importantly,\n\nthe review process for granting parole is currently based on\n\ncomprehensive, individualized assessments.   In determining\n\nwhether a particular inmate is suitable for parole, the board is\n\ncharged by statute with ascertaining the extent to which the\n\ninmate has been rehabilitated, and the extent to which, if\n\nreleased, he or she would pose a risk to the community.7   See\n\n\n     7\n       \"Decisions of the Executive Branch, however serious their\nimpact, do not automatically invoke due process protection;\nthere simply is no constitutional guarantee that all executive\ndecisionmaking must comply with standards that assure error-free\ndeterminations.\" Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Neb. Penal &\nCorrectional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 7 (1979). \"[T]he state may be\nspecific or general in defining the conditions for release and\n\f                                                                    24\n\n\nG. L. c. 127, § 130.   The board performs a \"risk and needs\n\nassessment\" as well.   Id.   In so doing, it has the authority to\n\nreview and evaluate an inmate's entire record.   See Greenman,\n\n405 Mass. at 387.   As required by statute, the board must be\n\nprovided with the complete criminal record of the inmate as well\n\nas reports on the inmate's social, physical, mental, and\n\npsychiatric condition and history.   G. L. c. 127, § 135.\n\nMoreover, in making its determination, the board \"shall consider\n\nwhether, during the period of incarceration, the prisoner has\n\nparticipated in available work opportunities and education or\n\ntreatment programs and demonstrated good behavior.\"   G. L.\n\nc. 127, § 130.   Finally, the board \"shall also consider whether\n\nrisk reduction programs, made available through collaboration\n\nwith criminal justice agencies would minimize the probability of\n\n\n\nthe factors that should be considered by the parole authority.\nIt is thus not surprising that there is no prescribed or defined\ncombination of facts which, if shown, would mandate release on\nparole. . . . In parole releases . . . few certainties exist.\nIn each case, the decision differs from the traditional mold of\njudicial decision-making in that the choice involves a synthesis\nof record facts and personal observation filtered through the\nexperience of the decision maker and leading to a predictive\njudgment as to what is best both for the individual inmate and\nfor the community. This latter conclusion requires the board to\nassess whether, in light of the nature of the crime, the\ninmate's release will minimize the gravity of the offense,\nweaken the deterrent impact on others, and undermine respect for\nthe administration of justice. The entire inquiry is, in a\nsense, an 'equity' type judgment that cannot always be\narticulated in traditional findings\" (footnote omitted). Id.\nat 8.\n\f                                                                     25\n\n\nthe prisoner re-offending once released.\"   Id.    All inmates are\n\nprovided subsequent parole hearings if parole is initially\n\ndenied.   120 Code Mass. Regs. § 300.01 (1997).    These hearings\n\nare open to the public and parole-eligible offenders serving\n\nlife sentences are permitted representation by counsel.     120\n\nCode Mass. Regs. §§ 300.02(2), 300.08 (1997).     Eventually, the\n\nboard's decision becomes a public record.   G. L. c. 127, § 130.\n\n    Further, in January, 2014, in response to Miller, the\n\nLegislature passed \"An Act relative to juvenile life sentences\n\nfor first degree murder\" (act).   St. 2014, c. 189.    The act\n\nimposed a series of statutory changes affecting juveniles\n\nconvicted of murder in the first degree including new sentencing\n\nand parole eligibility standards; mandating that at least one\n\nmember of the board have experience in forensic psychology;\n\nauthorizing the department to provide treatment and programming\n\nfor youthful offenders irrespective of their crimes or duration\n\nof incarceration; and allowing the placement of qualified\n\nyouthful offenders in a minimum security correctional facility,\n\nirrespective of their life sentence.   The act further\n\nestablished a commission to\n\n    \"study and determine the usefulness and practicality of\n    creating a developmental evaluation process for all cases\n    of first degree murder committed by a juvenile [between the\n    ages of fourteen and eighteen]. The evaluation process\n    shall determine the developmental progress and abilities of\n    the juvenile offender at the time of sentencing and parole\n    eligibility and the parole board shall utilize the\n\f                                                                    26\n\n\n    evaluation process for future parole decisions regarding\n    the juvenile offender.\"\n\n    In addition, the board, on its own initiative, amended its\n\n\"Guidelines for Life Sentence Decisions\" (guidelines) in light\n\nof Diatchenko I, requiring consideration of age-related factors\n\nin all parole cases involving juveniles convicted of murder in\n\nthe first degree and incorporating the specific factors that the\n\nconcurring justices considered when evaluating parole\n\nsuitability for such individuals.    See note 1, supra.\n\nAccordingly, inmates like the defendant now must be \"evaluated\n\nwith recognition of the distinctive attributes of youth,\n\nincluding immaturity, impetuosity, and a failure to appreciate\n\nrisks and consequences.\"    See Diatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 675\n\n(Lenk, J., concurring).    The guidelines now provide that the\n\nboard can and should consider, among other things, the specific\n\nfacts of the crime and rehabilitation.    Finally, in determining\n\nwhether the inmate has been rehabilitated, the guidelines\n\nprovide that the board shall consider his or her conduct while\n\nincarcerated.\n\n    Had this court intended to directly oversee the board's\n\nconsideration of parole, we would have specifically provided\n\nguidance concerning the proper balance of the necessary factors\n\nor when to find that parole is warranted.    Yet, we declined to\n\ndo so, specifically holding that it was in the board's \"purview\"\n\f                                                               27\n\n\nto evaluate the unique circumstances and conditions of the\n\ndefendant.   Diatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 674.   See Doe v.\n\nMassachusetts Parole Bd., 82 Mass. App. Ct. 851, 861 (2012).\n\nThis the board has done by revising its guidelines.\n\nAccordingly, a complaint for declaratory relief remains the best\n\nmanner to ensure the meaningfulness of parole hearings by\n\nallowing challenges to procedural elements of these hearings\n\nsuch as the guidelines.   See Nelson, 390 Mass. at 388 n.12.\n\nThere has been no showing that declaratory relief would be\n\nappropriate at this time.\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\f     CORDY, J. (dissenting, with whom Spina, J., joins).    I join\n\nand agree completely with Justice Spina's dissent.   I write\n\nseparately only to underscore my strongly held view that the\n\njudicial branch should not intrude on what is plainly an\n\nexecutive branch function in the absence of a showing that that\n\nbranch has failed to fulfil its legal or constitutional\n\nobligations.   There is not a hint of such a showing in this\n\ncase.    To the contrary, all indicators of executive branch\n\nintentions support the conclusion that \"meaningful\n\nopportunit[ies] to obtain release\" on parole have been and will\n\ncontinue to be provided to individuals serving life sentences\n\nfor murders they committed when they were juveniles.    There is\n\nno demonstrated need for the court to construct and order funded\n\na special parole and appellate process for such prisoners.1\n\n     While the directives in the court's ruling regarding\n\ncounsel, appeals, and the funding of experts may seem relatively\n\nbenign to some, in unnecessarily intruding on the functions of\n\nanother branch the court steps over the line that separates the\n\npowers accorded to each in our constitutional structure -- a\n\nseparation we have proudly proclaimed as a necessary element of\n\na constitutional democracy that ensures our government shall be\n\n     1\n       Indeed, as the court's opinion has noted, Gregory\nDiatchenko already has been granted parole.\n\f                                                                     2\n\n\none of laws and not of men.2    In doing so, the court also fails\n\nto accord the other branches the respect necessary to the proper\n\nfunctioning of a government where each has its own\n\nconstitutional responsibilities.    While the role of the\n\njudiciary may often include being a check on the other branches\n\nwhen they exceed or fail in the execution of those\n\nresponsibilities, it is distinctly not to exercise them.3\n\nAlthough we occasionally declare that the Massachusetts\n\nDeclaration of Rights creates certain duties in other branches,\n\nsuch as ensuring a meaningful opportunity for release on parole,\n\nwe leave it to those branches \"to define the precise nature of\n\nthe task[s] which they face in fulfilling\" those duties.\n\nMcDuffy v. Secretary of the Exec. Office of Educ., 415 Mass.\n\n545, 620 (1993).    To hold that such a meaningful opportunity can\n\nonly occur in the context of a parole hearing with counsel\n\nappointed, experts on retainer, and a special appellate process,\n\n\n     2\n         See art. 29 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\n     3\n       Last year, we were quick to declare that the community\nparole supervision for life law (G. L. c. 127, § 133D [a]) was\nan unconstitutional delegation of a quintessential judicial\nfunction, sentencing, to the parole board, an executive branch\nof government, in violation of the constitutional separation of\npowers clause at issue here. Commonwealth v. Cole, 468 Mass.\n294, 302 (2014). In so doing, we also underscored and confirmed\nthat the granting of parole is \"a discretionary act\" and a\n\"function of the executive branch of government with which, if\notherwise constitutionally exercised, the judiciary may not\ninterfere\" (emphasis added). Id.\n\f                                                                   3\n\n\nis to declare that we know best how to perform the tasks\n\nconstitutionally assigned to others, in the absence of any\n\nevidence of failure or excess.4   This substitution at this\n\njuncture of our judgment for that of the parole board as to the\n\nexpertise and advocacy necessary for it to properly exercise its\n\nexecutive discretion is a slippery slope, and one down which we\n\nshould not embark.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       There is no suggestion in the court's opinion that the\nstandard for determining an individual's suitability for parole\nfor persons convicted of murder when they were juveniles is any\ndifferent from the standard of suitability that any other\nprisoner must satisfy in order to obtain release on parole,\ni.e., that there is a \"reasonable probability that, if the\nprisoner is released with appropriate conditions and community\nsupervision, the prisoner will live and remain at liberty\nwithout violating the law, and that release is not incompatible\nwith the welfare of society.\" G.

Roberio,5 each of\n\nwhom was convicted of murder in the first degree many years ago\n\nfor a crime committed when he was seventeen years old,6 argue\n\nthat in order to ensure that their opportunity for release\n\nthrough parole is meaningful, they must have, in connection with\n\na petition for release before the parole board (board), access\n\nto counsel, access to funds for counsel and for expert witnesses\n\n\nof life in prison without parole violates art. 26 of the\nMassachusetts Declaration of Rights, which forbids the\ninfliction of \"cruel or unusual punishments.\"\n     5\n       As discussed infra, in September of 2014, Roberio moved to\nintervene as a petitioner in Gregory Diatchenko's case, and the\nmotion was allowed.\n     6\n       For further discussion of the crimes for which Diatchenko\nand Roberio were convicted, see Commonwealth v.

For the\n\nreasons discussed below, we agree in substance with Diatchenko\n\nand Roberio.7\n\n     1.   Procedural history.   a.   Diatchenko.   In March of 2013,\n\nDiatchenko filed the present action in the county court, seeking\n\na declaration that, because he was convicted of murder in the\n\nfirst degree and was seventeen at the time he committed the\n\noffense, his mandatory sentence of life without parole was\n\nunconstitutional following the United States Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2469.      The single justice\n\nreported the case to the full court.\n\n     The court issued its opinion in December, 2013.     See\n\nDiatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 655.      Having determined that juvenile\n\nhomicide offenders could not validly be sentenced to life in\n\nprison without parole, the court turned to the task of finding\n\nan appropriate way to achieve a constitutionally permissible\n\nresult, while still recognizing the Legislature's primary role\n\n     7\n       We acknowledge the two amicus briefs submitted in support\nof Diatchenko and Roberio by Citizens for Juvenile Justice, the\nChildren's League of Massachusetts, Prisoners' Legal Services of\nMassachusetts, the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth,\nthe Justice Resource Institute, the Coalition for Effective\nPublic Safety, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and\nEconomic Justice, Professor Daniel Medwed, and the Hon. Gail\nGaringer (ret.); as well as the amicus brief submitted in\nsupport of Diatchenko by the Massachusetts Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers.\n\f                                                                       5\n\n\nin establishing sentences for criminal offenses.   The approach\n\nwe took was to declare invalid, as applied to juvenile homicide\n\noffenders, certain language in G. L. c. 265, § 2, creating an\n\nexception to parole eligibility for those convicted of murder in\n\nthe first degree and leaving in full effect the remainder of the\n\nstatute that imposed a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nSee Diatchenko I, supra at 673.   The result was that any\n\njuvenile offender previously convicted of murder in the first\n\ndegree, including Diatchenko, became eligible for parole after\n\nserving fifteen years of his or her sentence.   See id.     See also\n\nG. L. c. 265, § 2, as amended through St. 1982, c. 554, § 3;\n\nG. L. c. 127, § 133A, as amended through St. 1965, c. 766, § 1.\n\nBecause Diatchenko had already served approximately thirty-one\n\nyears of his life sentence, he became eligible for parole\n\nimmediately.   See Diatchenko I, supra.8\n\n    Pursuant to the opinion's rescript, the case was remanded\n\nto the single justice with the direction to enter a judgment\n\n\n    8\n       In Commonwealth v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013), decided\nthe same day as Diatchenko I, the remedy in Diatchenko I was\nextended to include juvenile offenders sentenced to life in\nprison for murder in the first degree going forward, such that\nthey also are entitled to a parole hearing. Brown, supra at\n688. The Legislature has since responded to these decisions by\namending G. L. c. 265, § 2, and G. L. c. 127, § 133A, to\nincorporate into the statutes parole eligibility for juvenile\noffenders convicted of first-degree murder. See G. L. c. 265,\n§ 2, as amended through St. 2014, c. 189, § 5; G. L. c. 127,\n§ 133A, as amended through St. 2014, c. 189, § 3.\n\f                                                                    6\n\n\nconsistent with the court's opinion in the case and to \"take\n\nsuch further action as is necessary and appropriate.\"   On\n\nFebruary 27, 2014, Diatchenko filed a motion for entry of a\n\njudgment that would include a number of orders of specific\n\nrelief, and also filed a motion for funds to retain an expert in\n\nconnection with his hearing before the board.   The district\n\nattorney for the Suffolk District (district attorney), the chair\n\nof the board, and the Commissioner of Correction (commissioner)\n\nfiled oppositions.   After a hearing, the single justice reserved\n\nand reported Diatchenko's case as well as Roberio's case, next\n\ndiscussed, to the full court.\n\n    In connection with the Diatchenko case, the single justice\n\nreported the following questions:\n\n    \"1. Whether, in order to ensure that the petitioner and\n    other similarly situated juvenile homicide offenders\n    receive the 'meaningful opportunity to obtain release' that\n    is required by the court's opinion [in Diatchenko I], they\n    must be afforded:\n\n    \"a. the right to assistance of counsel at their parole\n    hearings, including the right to have counsel appointed if\n    they are indigent; and\n\n    \"b. the right to public funds, if they are indigent, in\n    order to secure reasonably necessary expert assistance at\n    the hearings.\n\n    \"2. Whether, in order to ensure that the petitioner and\n    other similarly situated juvenile homicide offenders\n    receive the 'meaningful opportunity to obtain release' that\n    is required by the court's opinion, there must be an\n    opportunity for the petitioner or a similarly situated\n    individual who is denied parole to obtain judicial review\n\f                                                                       7\n\n\n    of the parole board's decision, and if so, what form the\n    judicial review will take.\"\n\n    b.    Roberio.   Following the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nMiller, in June, 2013, Roberio sought relief from his mandatory\n\nsentence of life without parole by moving in the Superior Court\n\nfor resentencing under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30, as appearing in </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1501</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001).    He also filed a motion for funds pursuant to\n\nrule 30 (c) (5) to pay an expert neuropsychologist for\n\nassistance in connection with his motion for resentencing.       The\n\nmotion for funds was allowed, but Roberio's motion for\n\nresentencing was stayed pending the release of our decision in\n\nDiatchenko I, at which point he was resentenced to life with\n\nparole eligibility after fifteen years in prison.    Because\n\nRoberio had been in prison for more than fifteen years, he was\n\nimmediately eligible for parole.\n\n    On February 27, 2014, Roberio filed another motion for\n\nfunds pursuant to rule 30 (c) (5) to retain the services of a\n\nsecond neuropsychologist because the previous neuropsychologist\n\nhad died; Roberio sought to retain the expert in order to\n\ncontinue to seek to have his sentence reduced to a term of years\n\nor, alternatively, to assist him in connection with seeking\n\nparole.   A second Superior Court judge allowed the motion after\n\nhearing, but stayed the order to permit the Commonwealth to seek\n\nrelief from the single justice.    On March 10, 2014, the\n\f                                                                      8\n\n\nCommonwealth filed a petition for relief under G. L. c. 211,\n\n§ 3, challenging the orders allowing Roberio's requests for\n\nfunds to retain the experts.     As indicated, on May 23, 2014, the\n\nsingle justice reserved and reported the Roberio case to the\n\nfull court for decision, to be paired with the Diatchenko case.\n\nIn September, 2014, Roberio filed a motion to intervene in the\n\nDiatchenko case.    The single justice allowed the motion.\n\n    2.    Suggestion of mootness.    \"Litigation ordinarily is\n\nconsidered moot when the party claiming to be aggrieved ceases\n\nto have a personal stake in its outcome.\"     Acting Supt. of\n\nBournewood Hosp. v. Baker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (2000),\n\nquoting Attorney Gen. v. Commissioner of Ins., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n380 (1988).    The chair of the board, the commissioner, and the\n\ndistrict attorney suggest that the case is moot with respect to\n\nDiatchenko because on October 31, 2014, the board approved his\n\napplication for parole, and therefore, they contend, Diatchenko\n\nno longer has a personal stake in the resolution of the present\n\ncase.    See Massachusetts Parole Board, No. W38579, at 1 (Oct.\n\n31, 2014).    However, Diatchenko has not yet been released on\n\nparole; rather, the board required that Diatchenko first spend\n\ntwelve months in a lower security prison before he may be\n\nreleased, so that he may \"transition gradually to the\n\ncommunity.\"    Id. at 7.   Since Diatchenko has not yet been\n\nreleased, he continues to have a personal stake in the outcome\n\f                                                                      9\n\n\nof the case, and therefore his petition is not moot.     Moreover,\n\nRoberio has been permitted to intervene in the Diatchenko case,\n\nand he has not yet had a parole hearing.     Even if the case were\n\nmoot as to Diatchenko, therefore, it is not moot with respect to\n\nRoberio.    We proceed to consider the reported questions and\n\nrelated claims raised on their merits.\n\n     3.    Discussion.   a.   Right to assistance of counsel.   The\n\nfirst reported question asks whether a juvenile homicide\n\noffender must be afforded the assistance of counsel in\n\nconnection with his or her initial parole hearing.9     It is\n\nimportant to view the question in context.     The court's\n\nconclusion in Diatchenko I, that juvenile homicide offenders\n\ncould not permissibly be subjected to life in prison without any\n\nopportunity for parole, flowed from the \"fundamental '\"precept\n\nof justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and\n\nproportioned\" to both the offender and the offense,'\" a central\n\ntenet of the Eighth Amendment and of art. 26.     Diatchenko I, 466\n\nMass. at 669, quoting Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2463.     Drawing from\n\nthe United States Supreme Court's recent decisions that focused\n\non the requirement of proportional sentencing of youth, and in\n\n     9\n       The reported questions do not specify the initial parole\nhearing, but we understand that to be the intended focus, and\nconsider it as such. We therefore do not consider here whether\nthe procedural rights that we discuss in this opinion only apply\nwith respect to a juvenile homicide offender's initial parole\nhearing.\n\f                                                                    10\n\n\nparticular the decisions in Miller and Graham,10 Diatchenko I\n\nobserved that \"children are constitutionally different from\n\nadults for purposes of sentencing\" and that the \"distinctive\n\nattributes of juvenile offenders\" render suspect the traditional\n\njustifications for imposing sentences of life without parole on\n\nthese individuals.   Diatchenko I, supra at 670-671, quoting\n\nMiller, supra at 2465.   Therefore, in Diatchenko I, we held that\n\nDiatchenko and all juvenile homicide offenders serving mandatory\n\nlife sentences deserve at least a \"meaningful opportunity to\n\nobtain release based on demonstrated maturity and\n\nrehabilitation,\" and that accordingly, at the appropriate time,\n\nthey must be considered for parole suitability.     Diatchenko I,\n\nsupra at 671, 674, quoting Graham, 560 U.S. at 75.    In other\n\nwords, the conclusion we reached was that parole eligibility is\n\nan essential component of a constitutional sentence under art.\n\n26 for a juvenile homicide offender subject to mandatory life in\n\nprison.11\n\n\n     10\n       In Miller v. Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2959737\"><a href=\"/opinion/2959737/miller-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Florida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150543\"><a href=\"/opinion/150543/graham-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (2010), the Court held that\nthose who committed a nonhomicide offense before the age of\neighteen can never receive such sentences.\n     11\n       Justice Spina's dissent argues that because Miller refers\nspecifically to the requirement of proportionality in\n\f                                                                     11\n\n\n       In general, there is no constitutionally protected liberty\n\ninterest in a grant of parole.

Penal & Correctional Complex, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110085\"><a href=\"/opinion/110085/greenholtz-v-inmates-of-neb-penal-and-correctional-complex/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1979); Quegan\n\nv.

See also Board of Pardons v. Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111914\"><a href=\"/opinion/111914/board-of-pardons-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371-372, 381 (1987).\n\n       Here, G. L. c. 127, § 130, does not create an expectation\n\nof release through parole, as Justice Spina's dissent points\n\nout.    See post at      .   Rather, what is at issue is art. 26's\n\n\n\n\"sentencing,\" unless a parole hearing is viewed as part of the\nsentencing process, there can be no constitutional basis for the\nprocedural protections in parole hearings that the petitioners\nseek. See post at     . However, in concluding that all\njuvenile homicide offenders must have access to a \"meaningful\nopportunity to obtain release,\" Diatchenko I identified under\nart. 26 a substantive requirement concerning the nature of the\nsentences that juvenile homicide offenders must receive. See\nDiatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 671, 674, quoting Graham, 560 U.S. at\n75. This requirement goes beyond the procedural issue that\nMiller identified under the Eighth Amendment.\n\f                                                                  12\n\n\nrequirement that a juvenile homicide offender serving a\n\nmandatory life sentence be provided a meaningful opportunity to\n\nobtain release, so that his or her sentence is not effectively\n\none of straight life in prison -- an outcome that art. 26\n\nprohibits.   In this context, where the meaningful opportunity\n\nfor release through parole is necessary in order to conform the\n\njuvenile homicide offender's mandatory life sentence to the\n\nrequirements of art. 26, the parole process takes on a\n\nconstitutional dimension that does not exist for other offenders\n\nwhose sentences include parole eligibility.12\n\n     Thus, for example, in the case of an adult defendant\n\nconvicted of armed robbery and sentenced to a term of not less\n\nthan sixteen nor more than twenty years in prison, the defendant\n\n\n     12\n       The fact that the opportunity for release through parole\nis essential in order to guarantee the constitutionality of a\njuvenile homicide offender's mandatory sentence of life in\nprison does not \"transform[] the conduct of the parole hearing\ninto part of the sentencing process\" in this context, as Justice\nSpina's dissent suggests. See post at     . Rather, for a\njuvenile homicide offender -- as for virtually any offender\nexcept an adult convicted of murder in the first degree -- the\noffender's sentence is fixed at the time of sentencing, and the\nopportunity to seek parole is merely a component of the sentence\nthat the offender receives from a judge. See Commonwealth v.\nCole, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298-299, 302 (2014). See also G. L.\nc. 279, § 24. Our decision today does not undermine this\nrelationship between sentencing and parole, but rather explores\nfurther the purpose that parole eligibility serves in the\ncontext of a juvenile homicide offender’s mandatory life\nsentence, and the additional protections that juvenile homicide\noffenders require in order to ensure that that purpose is fully\nachieved.\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\nwould be eligible for parole in sixteen years,13 but if the\n\ndefendant were denied a meaningful opportunity for release on\n\nparole, this would not render the sentence cruel or unusual and\n\ntherefore unconstitutional under art. 26.    This is so because a\n\nState has no obligation to provide a parole system, see\n\nGreenholtz, 442 U.S. at 7-8, and if the defendant were to serve\n\nhis or her entire sentence of twenty years with no opportunity\n\nat all for release on parole, that would have been a permissible\n\nsentence for the judge to have imposed at the outset.     The same\n\nis not true for juvenile homicide offenders; under G. L. c. 265,\n\n§ 2, they must be sentenced to life in prison, but art. 26 does\n\nnot allow either the Legislature or a judge to sentence such an\n\noffender to life in prison without the possibility of parole.14\n\n\n     13\n          See G. L. c. 127, § 133; G. L. c. 279, § 24.\n     14\n       Justice Spina's dissent emphasizes, post at    , that our\ndecisions in Diatchenko I, Brown, Commonwealth v. Ray, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">115</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014), and Commonwealth v. Keo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014), each\napplied the mandatory life sentence as specified in G. L.\nc. 265, § 2, for murder in the first degree to juvenile homicide\noffenders, albeit with the added instruction that these\noffenders must be eligible for parole in accordance with the\nparole statute. See Ray, supra at 140; Keo, supra at 46-47.\nSee also Diatchenko I, supra at 674 (\"At the appropriate time,\nit is the purview of the . . . board to evaluate the\ncircumstances surrounding the commission of the crime, including\nthe age of the offender, together with all relevant information\npertaining to the offender's character and actions during the\nintervening years since conviction. By this process, a juvenile\nhomicide offender will be afforded a meaningful opportunity to\nbe considered for parole suitability\"). From this, the dissent\nconcludes that these decisions stand for the propositions that\n\f                                                                   14\n\n\n     We turn, then, to the question of what is procedurally\n\nrequired in order to protect a juvenile homicide offender's\n\nexpectation of \"a meaningful opportunity to obtain release based\n\non demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\"   Graham, 560 U.S.\n\nat 75.15   \"The extent of procedural due process which must be\n\n\n\nthe existing parole procedures already afford a meaningful\nopportunity for release and that juvenile homicide offenders are\n\"entitled only to the same parole hearing process as other\ninmates.\" See post at     . The dissent then contends that\ntoday's decision improperly changes course and affords something\nmore. See post at     . We disagree that we have changed\ncourse. The cited decisions focused explicitly on the\nsubstantive punishment that the defendants in those cases must\nreceive; in none of them did the court address any issue\nregarding the nature of the parole process for juvenile homicide\noffenders. See Diatchenko I, supra at 674 n.18 (\"The heart of\nthis case is the constitutional validity of Diatchenko's\nsentence for murder in the first degree\"). Moreover, as\ndiscussed infra, nothing in this opinion suggests that the\nprocedures described in G. L. c. 127, § 133A, no longer apply to\njuvenile homicide offenders. Rather, today's decision\nidentifies additional procedural protections that must be\nafforded to these offenders within the context of the existing\nparole process, and an opportunity for a limited review of the\nboard's decision.\n\n     Similarly, today's decision in no way conflicts with the\nSupreme Court's holdings in Miller and Graham. Each of those\ncases addressed a specific context in which the Eighth Amendment\nprohibits the imposition of a sentence of life without parole on\na juvenile offender. See Miller, 132 S.

See 103 Code Mass.\n\nRegs. §§ 155.07, 155.08 (2004).    However, an inmate's access to\n\ncertain evaluative information contained in this folder as well\n\nas other types of information available to the board may be\n\nrestricted.   See 103 Code Mass.

Regs.\n\n§ 301.06(1) (2001).   Notice of the hearing is provided to\n\ngovernment officials, including the Attorney General, the office\n\nof the district attorney in whose district the inmate's sentence\n\nwas imposed, the chief of police of the municipality where the\n\ncrime was committed, and the Executive Office of Public Safety,\n\nas well as to the victim or the victim's immediate family\n\nmembers.   See G. L. c. 127, § 133A; 120 Code Mass. Regs.\n\n§ 301.06(3) (2001).   During the parole hearing, the inmate or\n\f                                                                   18\n\n\nhis or her representative has an opportunity to make an opening\n\nstatement, and then the inmate responds to questions from the\n\nboard.    120 Code Mass. Regs. § 301.06(4) (2001).   The board also\n\nmay pose questions to any individual who appears in support of\n\nthe inmate.   Id.   After the inmate has completed his or her\n\npresentation, the victim or victim's family has an opportunity\n\nto speak, as do public officials, and the board is tasked with\n\neliciting \"available evidence and testimony unfavorable to the\n\ninmate upon any relevant subject.\"    Id.   The board may permit\n\nthe inmate to make a closing statement and may allow parties to\n\nsubmit memoranda or other documentation after the hearing.      120\n\nCode Mass. Regs. §§ 301.06(4), (5) (2001).    The board permits\n\nattorneys to represent inmates serving life sentences at their\n\nparole hearings, although currently there is no provision for\n\nproviding counsel to those who are indigent.17    120 Code Mass.\n\nRegs. § 300.08 (1997).\n\n     The question the board must answer for each inmate seeking\n\nparole, namely, whether he or she is likely to reoffend,\n\nrequires the board to weigh multiple factors and consider a wide\n\n\n     17\n       The board and the commissioner recognize in their brief\nthat \"certain benefits flow from access to counsel and experts,\"\nand therefore have taken no position on the first two questions\nreported by the single justice in the Diatchenko case. The\ndistrict attorney for the Suffolk District, however, argues that\nDiatchenko and Roberio are not entitled to counsel, funds to\nretain counsel, or funds to retain experts.\n\f                                                                   19\n\n\nvariety of evidence.   In the case of a juvenile homicide\n\noffender -- at least at the initial parole hearing -- the task\n\nis probably far more complex than in the case of an adult\n\noffender because of \"the unique characteristics\" of juvenile\n\noffenders.   Diatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 674.   See Miller, 132 S.\n\nCt. at 2464.   A potentially massive amount of information bears\n\non these issues, including legal, medical, disciplinary,\n\neducational, and work-related evidence.   In addition, although a\n\nparole hearing is unlike a traditional trial in that it does not\n\ninvolve direct and cross-examination of witnesses by attorneys,\n\nbecause the inmate's parole application may well be opposed by\n\nboth the victim's family and public officials, it would be\n\ndifficult to characterize this as an uncontested proceeding.\n\n     Thus, like a proceeding to terminate parental rights, a\n\nparole hearing for a juvenile homicide offender serving a\n\nmandatory life sentence involves complex and multifaceted issues\n\nthat require the potential marshalling, presentation, and\n\nrebuttal of information derived from many sources.   See J.K.B.,\n\n379 Mass. at 4.   An unrepresented, indigent juvenile homicide\n\noffender will likely lack the skills and resources to gather,\n\nanalyze, and present this evidence adequately.18   Furthermore,\n\n\n     18\n       A juvenile homicide offender -- who will have spent his\nor her entire adult life and presumably some of his or her\nteenage years in prison -- also will likely need to overcome a\n\f                                                                  20\n\n\nalthough parole hearings are not contested in the strictest\n\nsense, the juvenile homicide offender seeking parole is likely\n\nto be required to overcome arguments by both victims' family\n\nmembers and government officials opposed to the offender's\n\nrelease; the former of these parties may present as particularly\n\nsympathetic, while the latter will likely have greater advocacy\n\nskills than the offender seeking parole.19\n\n     In sum, given the challenges involved for a juvenile\n\nhomicide offender serving a mandatory life sentence to advocate\n\neffectively for parole release on his or her own, and in light\n\nof the fact that the offender's opportunity for release is\n\ncritical to the constitutionality of the sentence, we conclude\n\n\n\nhost of personal challenges in order to be able to present a\npersuasive case for parole on his or her own. The challenges\ncould include a lack of formal education, as well as undeveloped\ncritical thinking and organizational skills; a history of\ntrauma, drug use, or mental illness; a limited ability to access\nhis or her own psychiatric or other record information regarding\nthe impact or context of this history; and balancing the need to\ntake responsibility and express remorse for the crime, while at\nthe same time pointing out all the factors that may have made\nhim or her, as a juvenile, less morally culpable. See Russell,\nReview for Release: Juvenile Offenders, State Parole Practices,\nand the Eighth Amendment, 89 Ind. L.J. 373, 419-421 (2014). An\nespecially significant challenge is likely to be the juvenile\noffender's isolation from the outside community, making it\ndifficult to present a solid release plan. See id. at 421.\n     19\n       Additionally, as noted in the context of parental rights\ntermination cases, the availability of counsel in a case may\nhelp to clarify for the decision maker some of the more\ncomplicated issues involved.

Welfare v.\nJ.K.B., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2082916\"><a href=\"/opinion/2082916/department-of-public-welfare-v-jkb/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1979).\n\f                                                                 21\n\n\nthat this opportunity is not likely to be \"meaningful\" as\n\nrequired by art. 26 without access to counsel.\n\n     Turning to the question of appointment of counsel for\n\nindigent juvenile homicide offenders like Diatchenko and\n\nRoberio, G. L. c. 211D, § 5, authorizes the Committee for Public\n\nCounsel Services (committee) to maintain a system for\n\nappointment of counsel at any stage of a criminal or noncriminal\n\nproceeding in which \"the laws of the commonwealth or the rules\n\nof the supreme judicial court require that a person in such\n\nproceeding be represented by counsel . . . provided . . . that\n\nsuch person is unable to obtain counsel by reason of his\n\nindigency.\"    In light of our conclusion here that a juvenile\n\nhomicide offender serving a mandatory life sentence must have\n\naccess to counsel in connection with an initial application for\n\nparole, § 5D offers legislative authorization and an appropriate\n\nmechanism, through the work of the committee, for the\n\nappointment of counsel for indigent juvenile homicide\n\noffenders.20\n\n\n     20\n       We acknowledge that Quegan v. Massachusetts Parole Bd.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996), appears to contradict this conclusion.\nSee id. at 840 (\"[The Committee for Public Counsel Services\n(CPCS)] has no right, however, to represent an indigent prisoner\nbefore the parole board unless there is a criminal proceeding\npending in which CPCS represents the prisoner and representation\nof the prisoner-defendant before the parole board is appropriate\nin order to protect the defendant's interests in the pending\ncriminal matter\"). However, Quegan was decided in the context\n\f                                                                  22\n\n\n     b.   Access to funds for expert witnesses.   The second\n\nreported question concerns access to expert witnesses.21\n\nDiatchenko and Roberio contend that, like access to counsel, it\n\nis necessary, in order to secure a meaningful opportunity for\n\nrelease, to have access to the assistance of expert witnesses.\n\nSpecifically, they argue that, as juvenile offenders convicted\n\nof murder, they need experts to be able to explain and offer\n\nopinions on issues concerning the relationship between\n\nneurobiological immaturity and culpability in general as well as\n\nfactors relating to each of their individual and family\n\ncircumstances that may help both to explain past conduct and\n\nassess future risk of reoffending.   As this court acknowledged\n\nin Diatchenko I, scientific research on adolescent brain\n\ndevelopment has revealed \"myriad significant ways that this\n\ndevelopment impacts a juvenile's personality and behavior,\" some\n\nof which suggest decreased moral culpability for certain\n\n\nof a prisoner seeking parole who had no constitutionally\nprotected interest that entitled him to any due process\nprotections. See id. at 836, 839. Here, we have concluded that\na juvenile homicide offender is entitled to representation by\ncounsel in connection with the initial parole hearing. Legal\nrepresentation of an indigent juvenile homicide offender is thus\nrequired by law. See id. at 839. In addition, the court in\nQuegan was interpreting a section of G. L. c. 211D that has\nsince been repealed by the Legislature. See id.; G. L. c. 211D,\n§ 14, repealed by St. 2011, c. 68, § 117.\n     21\n       The second reported question, in substance, raises many\nif not all of the issues of concern to the Commonwealth in its\nG. L. c. 211, § 3, petition in the Roberio case.\n\f                                                                  23\n\n\njuvenile homicide offenders or indicate a greater potential for\n\nthem to mature to a point where they no longer engage in the\n\nbehaviors that led to their crimes.   See Diatchenko I, 466 Mass.\n\nat 669-670.22   While the assistance of a psychologist or other\n\nexpert witness may not be necessary for every juvenile homicide\n\noffender serving a life sentence who seeks parole, in some cases\n\nsuch assistance may be crucial to the juvenile's ability to\n\nobtain a meaningful chance of release.23\n\n\n     22\n       See also Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2464-2465 (research on\nadolescents showing \"transient rashness, proclivity for risk,\nand inability to assess consequences . . . both lessened a\nchild's 'moral culpability' and enhanced the prospect that, as\nthe years go by and neurological development occurs, his\n'deficiencies will be reformed'\" [citation omitted]); Graham,\n560 U.S. at 68 (\"[D]evelopments in psychology and brain science\ncontinue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and\nadult minds. For example, parts of the brain involved in\nbehavior control continue to mature through late adolescence\").\n     23\n       Roberio's case offers a good example of how a juvenile\nhomicide offender's mental health and cognitive development\nhistory could become a central issue in a parole hearing. At\nRoberio's second murder trial, he presented a defense that, at\nthe time of his crime, he lacked the substantial capacity to\nconform his conduct to the requirements of the law due to an\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder, an oppositional\ndefiant disorder, and a learning disability, all of which were\nexacerbated by alcohol use. See Commonwealth v. Roberio, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247 (2003). A psychological reevaluation of Roberio\nin 2013, when he was forty-four years old, suggested to the\nneuropsychologist performing the evaluation that many of the\nneurological and behavioral challenges Roberio experienced in\nhis teenage years had resolved. In these circumstances, it may\nbe essential that Roberio be in a position to present the board\nwith an expert opinion explaining the path of his apparent\ngrowth in cognitive and emotional maturity and its relationship\nto the question of whether he would be likely to reoffend if\n\f                                                                  24\n\n\n     Neither G. L. c. 211D, § 5, nor any other statute expressly\n\nauthorizes the expenditure of funds for expert witnesses to\n\nassist such a juvenile in the context of a parole hearing.\n\nRoberio argues that the allowance of the fee request is\n\nauthorized under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (5), which in relevant\n\npart provides:   \"The court, after notice to the Commonwealth and\n\nan opportunity to be heard, may also exercise discretion to\n\nallow the defendant costs associated with the preparation and\n\npresentation of a motion under this rule.\"   However, we agree\n\nwith the Commonwealth that in its current form, rule 30 (c) (5)\n\ndoes not authorize the allowance of funds to a defendant to\n\nretain an expert witness in connection with a parole hearing,\n\nbecause a parole hearing is not a \"motion under this rule [i.e.,\n\nrule 30].\"24\n\n     It is also the case that G. L. c. 261, §§ 27A–27G, the\n\nstatutory provisions generally authorizing the payment of public\n\nfunds to cover costs and fees of indigent litigants, apply most\n\ndirectly to costs and fees relating to court proceedings, not\n\nproceedings before administrative or executive agencies like the\n\n\nreleased on parole. As previously indicated, the board\nacknowledges that the availability of expert witnesses may be\nbeneficial in the parole hearing context.\n     24\n       The motions specifically described in Mass.

Rules of Court, Rules\nof Criminal Procedure, at 223 (Thomson Reuters 2014), for the\npremise that judges have discretion to authorize costs to\ndefendants when necessary to guarantee meaningful access to\npostconviction procedures.\n\f                                                                   27\n\n\npayment of fees to an expert witness to assist the offender in\n\nconnection with his or her initial parole proceeding in certain\n\nlimited contexts -- specifically, where it is shown that the\n\njuvenile offender requires an expert's assistance in order\n\neffectively to explain the effects of the individual's\n\nneurobiological immaturity and other personal circumstances at\n\nthe time of the crime, and how this information relates to the\n\nindividual's present capacity and future risk of reoffending.\n\nThe judge may exercise discretion to do so when the judge\n\nconcludes that the assistance of the expert is reasonably\n\nnecessary to protect the juvenile homicide offender's meaningful\n\nopportunity for release.28\n\n     c.   Availability of judicial review.   The third reported\n\nquestion asks whether there must be an opportunity for judicial\n\nreview of a decision denying parole to a juvenile homicide\n\noffender and, if so, what form judicial review will take.    The\n\nboard, the commissioner, and the district attorney argue that\n\nart. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights prohibits\n\njudicial review in this context.   Article 30 requires strict\n\nseparation of judicial and executive powers, and the power to\n\n\n     28\n       We request this court's standing advisory committee on\nthe rules of criminal procedure to propose a procedure that will\npermit an indigent juvenile homicide offender to seek funds for\nan expert witness or witnesses to support the offender's\nrequests for parole, consistent with this opinion.\n\f                                                                    28\n\n\ngrant parole, being fundamentally related to the execution of a\n\nprisoner's sentence, lies exclusively within the province of the\n\nexecutive branch.   See Cole, 468 Mass. at 302-303; Commonwealth\n\nv. Amirault, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2157850\"><a href=\"/opinion/2157850/commonwealth-v-amirault/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 116-117 (1993).     However, as we have\n\nnoted, the right of the executive branch to exercise this power\n\nwithout intervention from the judiciary is subject to the\n\nprovision that the power must be \"constitutionally exercised.\"\n\nSee Cole, supra at 302.   This is not to suggest that the board\n\nis unconstitutionally exercising this power currently,29 or is\n\nlikely to do so in the future, but only that this court retains\n\nthe responsibility with respect to parole hearings to ensure\n\nthat any constitutional requirements are met.    Thus, this court\n\nhas never held that art. 30 precludes any type of judicial\n\nreview of parole board decisions.   In fact, Massachusetts courts\n\nhave engaged in limited review of parole proceedings,\n\nconsistently if not frequently.

To repeat:   it is\n\nnot a guarantee of eventual release, but an entitlement to a\n\nmeaningful opportunity for such release based on demonstrated\n\nmaturity and rehabilitation.    See Diatchenko I, 466 Mass. at\n\n674.    That entitlement arises directly from the recognition that\n\n\n       32\n       In light of Diatchenko I, the board has adopted\nguidelines for parole determinations for juvenile homicide\noffenders serving life sentences, and these guidelines take into\naccount the unique characteristics of youth. See Massachusetts\nParole Board, Guidelines for Life Sentence Decisions (updated\nMar. 3, 2014), available at http://www.mass.gov/eopss/agencies/\nparole-board/guidelines-for-life-sentence-decisions.html\n[http://perma.cc/K33Z-YSEA]. The board is to be commended for\ndoing so, but its adoption of guidelines does not preclude or\nrender unnecessary the need for judicial review. The guidelines\nare not binding and are subject to change. More importantly,\nthe board is not in a position to make a determination that the\nart. 26 right of a juvenile homicide offender to a proportionate\nsentence has been protected.\n\n     Nor does the existence of appeal procedures before the\nboard adequately protect this right. The board's regulations\npermit inmates denied parole to request an appeal before the\nsame hearing panel that rendered the initial denial, or to\nrequest reconsideration by a staff member of the board. See 120\nCode Mass. Regs. §§ 100.00, 304.1 (2001). Neither of these\nprocesses provides the same opportunity for review by a neutral\ndecision maker that judicial review affords.\n\f                                                                     31\n\n\nchildren are constitutionally different from adults, with\n\n\"diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform,\"\n\nMiller, 132 S. Ct. at 2464, based on their \"distinctive\n\nattributes\" of youth.   See Diatchenko I, supra at 660, 671.\n\nThese include children's \"lack of maturity and an underdeveloped\n\nsense of responsibility, leading to recklessness, impulsivity,\n\nand heedless risk-taking\"; vulnerability \"to negative influences\n\nand outside pressures, including from their family and peers;\n\n. . . limited contro[l] over their own environment[;] . . .\n\n[lack of] the ability to extricate themselves from horrific,\n\ncrime-producing settings\"; and unique capacity to change as they\n\ngrow older (citations and quotations omitted).    Id. at 660.\n\nAbsent consideration of these attributes, a juvenile homicide\n\noffender may not be permitted a real chance to demonstrate\n\nmaturity and rehabilitation.   See id. at 675 (Lenk, J.,\n\nconcurring), citing Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2468.    The purpose of\n\njudicial review here is not to substitute a judge's or an\n\nappellate court's opinion for the board's judgment on whether a\n\nparticular juvenile homicide offender merits parole, because\n\nthis would usurp impermissibly the role of the board.      Rather,\n\njudicial review is limited to the question whether the board has\n\ncarried out its responsibility to take into account the\n\nattributes or factors just described in making its decision.\n\f                                                                    32\n\n\n    With this in mind, we consider the form of judicial review\n\nof a board decision denying initial parole to a juvenile\n\nhomicide offender.   Diatchenko and Roberio suggest that judicial\n\nreview in this context should be in the nature of certiorari, as\n\ndescribed in G. L. c. 249, § 4, rather than through an action\n\nfor declaratory relief under G. L. c. 231A.    We agree that\n\ncertiorari is appropriate here, although we do not agree with\n\ntheir view of the scope or standard of that review.\n\n    \"[A] complaint for declaratory relief is an appropriate way\n\nof testing the validity of regulations or the propriety of\n\npractices involving violations of rights, which are consistent\n\nand repeated in nature. . . .

The question for the reviewing judge will be whether\n\nthe board abused its discretion in the manner in which it\n\nconsidered and dealt with \"the distinctive attributes of youth\n\n[that] diminish the penological justifications for imposing the\n\nharshest sentences on juvenile offenders,\" as they relate to the\n\nparticular circumstances of the juvenile homicide offender\n\nseeking parole.     Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2465.   Accord Diatchenko\n\nI, 466 Mass. at 671.     In this context, a denial of a parole\n\napplication by the board will constitute an abuse of discretion\n\nonly if the board essentially failed to take these factors into\n\naccount, or did so in a cursory way.     A judge may not reverse a\n\f                                                                  34\n\n\ndecision by the board denying a juvenile homicide offender\n\nparole and require that parole be granted.   Rather, if the judge\n\nconcludes that the board's consideration of the juvenile\n\noffender's status as a juvenile and the distinctive attributes\n\nof his or her youth did constitute an abuse of discretion -- was\n\narbitrary and capricious -- a remand to the board for rehearing\n\nwould be appropriate.33\n\n     It remains for us to address Diatchenko's argument that\n\njuvenile homicide offenders seeking review of a parole denial\n\nshould be able to bring an action for certiorari to a single\n\njustice of this court as a matter of course.   Although this\n\ncourt and the Superior Court have concurrent jurisdiction to\n\nentertain actions in the nature of certiorari under G. L.\n\nc. 249, § 4, as with most original actions for certiorari, these\n\nactions are most appropriately brought in the Superior Court.\n\n     Finally, we summarize the scope of our opinion in this\n\ncase, and clarify what the opinion does not say.   First, we\n\n\n     33\n       Justice Spina, in his dissent, expresses concern that\nwithout the affirmative power to grant parole after a denial by\nthe board, this limited form of judicial review has the\npotential to result in an endless cycle of board hearings and\nactions for certiorari, until the board ultimately grants\nparole. See post at     . This outcome is unlikely. Given the\nlimited scope of judicial review in this context, and the\ndeference that must be afforded to the board, we think decisions\nto vacate a parole denial will be rare; moreover, should that\noccur, we assume that at a new hearing, the board will remedy\nthe error or errors that caused the matter to be remanded.\n\f                                                                   35\n\n\nconsider here only the initial parole hearing available to\n\njuvenile homicide offenders.   For the reasons discussed supra,\n\nthe procedural protections of representation by counsel and the\n\nopportunity to obtain expert assistance in connection with that\n\ninitial parole hearing are necessary for such offenders in light\n\nof their mandatory life sentences and the constitutional\n\nrequirement of proportionality in sentencing.   See Diatchenko I,\n\n466 Mass. at 669-671; id. at 675 (Lenk, J., concurring).      In\n\nCommonwealth v. Okoro, post      ,     (2015), also decided\n\ntoday, and for the same reasons, we afford the same procedural\n\nprotections to juvenile offenders convicted of murder in the\n\nsecond degree, who also are subject to mandatory life sentences\n\nwith eligibility for parole.   Nothing in this opinion, however,\n\nis intended to suggest that any other class of offenders is also\n\nentitled to these protections in connection with the parole\n\nhearing process.\n\n    Second, in affording juvenile homicide offenders the\n\nprocedural protections at issue here, we emphasize that the\n\ndetermination whether to grant a parole application of an\n\nindividual juvenile homicide offender is, and remains, a\n\ndiscretionary decision for the board to make.   As previously\n\nnoted, that standard is governed by G. L. c. 127, § 130, which\n\nprohibits a prisoner from receiving parole unless the board\n\nconcludes that if the prisoner is released, \"the prisoner will\n\f                                                                     36\n\n\nlive and remain at liberty without violating the law and that\n\nrelease is not incompatible with the welfare of society.\"\n\n     Third, and relatedly, the board remains fully authorized to\n\ndetermine, consistent with legislative mandates,34 the rules and\n\nprocedures it deems appropriate for the conduct of its parole\n\nhearings, and free to reach whatever decision in each case it\n\ndeems appropriate.    The dissents suggest that in establishing\n\nminimal requirements of due process for juvenile homicide\n\noffenders in their parole hearings, the court interferes\n\nunnecessarily and improperly with the operations of the parole\n\nboard, an executive agency, trenching on principles of\n\nseparation of powers.    Post at    ,    .   Our decision does not\n\ncommit this offense.    Insofar as we conclude that the provision\n\nof counsel and of funds for expert witnesses is required for\n\njuvenile homicide offenders, these are procedures whose sole\n\npurpose is to protect the constitutional entitlement that these\n\njuvenile offenders have to a meaningful opportunity for parole\n\nrelease.35    Finally, the limited judicial review provided here\n\ndoes not authorize judges to substitute their judgment with\n\nrespect to the parole release decision for the board's.     As\n\n     34\n          See, e.g., G. L. c. 127, §§ 130, 133A.\n     35\n       As we have noted, see note 17, supra, the chair of the\nboard and the commissioner recognize \"certain benefits\nflow[ing]\" from these procedures, and do not view them as\ninterfering with the board's authority.\n\f                                                                  37\n\n\ndiscussed, the judiciary's only role in these cases will be to\n\nensure that the board's determination whether to grant or deny\n\nparole to a juvenile homicide offender is \"constitutionally\n\nexercised,\" Cole, 468 Mass. at 302, in the sense that the board\n\nproperly has taken into account the offender's status as a child\n\nwhen the crime was committed.\n\n    4.   Applicability of this decision.    Diatchenko and Roberio\n\nappear to confine their requests to the limited group of\n\nindividuals who were convicted of murder in the first degree and\n\nsentenced to mandatory life without parole prior to the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Miller, and who became eligible for parole\n\npursuant to this court's decision in Diatchenko I.    We do not\n\nshare the view that the decision in this case applies only to\n\nthat limited group.    Rather, it applies more generally to all\n\njuvenile offenders convicted of murder.\n\n    5.   Conclusion.    The matter is remanded to the county\n\ncourt, where the single justice will enter a judgment consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n                                     So ordered.\n\f    SPINA, J. (dissenting, with whom Cordy, J., joins).     I\n\nrespectfully dissent from the decision of the court today.      The\n\ncourt has misconstrued Diatchenko v. District Attorney for the\n\nSuffolk Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674 (2013) (Diatchenko I), which\n\nrequired only a \"meaningful opportunity to obtain release\" in\n\nthe form of a parole hearing for juveniles convicted of murder\n\nin the first degree.   The court instead has created a path by\n\nwhich such an offender may obtain, as of right, access to\n\ncounsel, funds for expert witnesses, and, if denied parole,\n\njudicial review of the decision of the parole board (board).\n\nThe solution at which the court arrives today ignores previous\n\nstatements of the law on this matter.    Our decision in\n\nDiatchenko I did not create a significant liberty interest in\n\nthe outcome of the parole hearing.    Diatchenko I stood solely\n\nfor the proposition that the exception to parole eligibility in\n\nG. L. c. 127, § 133A, no longer applies to Gregory Diatchenko\n\nand Jeffrey S.

The Supreme\n\nCourt reasoned that a sentence of life in prison without the\n\npossibility of parole removes any penological justification for\n\nthe sentence because it \"forswears altogether the rehabilitative\n\nideal.\"   Graham, supra at 74.\n\n     The court says \"the meaningful opportunity for release\n\nthrough parole is necessary in order to conform the juvenile\n\nhomicide offender's mandatory life sentence to the requirements\n\nof art. 26 [of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights].\"     Ante\n\nat    .   I agree.   After Diatchenko I, a juvenile convicted of\n\nmurder in the first degree, like every juvenile who is sentenced\n\nto incarceration, is eligible for parole, whereas before such a\n\njuvenile was not.    The thrust of Diatchenko I was an expectation\n\nof parole eligibility, and no more.\n\n     The court improperly synthesizes two premises to arrive at\n\na more significant but now constitutionally untenable\n\f                                                                      3\n\n\nconclusion.     The court correctly recognizes that (1) children\n\nare \"constitutionally different from adults for purposes of\n\nsentencing\" and (2) that a life sentence for a juvenile\n\nconvicted of murder in the first degree is cruel and unusual\n\nunder art. 26 without a meaningful opportunity for release\n\nthrough a demonstration of rehabilitation.       Fusing these\n\npropositions together, the court concludes that the \"meaningful\n\nopportunity\" for release for juveniles convicted of murder in\n\nthe first degree has a \"constitutional dimension\" that exists\n\nfor no others and requires \"additional procedural protections.\"\n\nAnte at      & n.14.   This conclusion is erroneous because the\n\ncourt applies the first premise to the second when, in fact, the\n\nsecond premise flows from the first.\n\n    The court states that other sentences, except life\n\nsentences for juveniles convicted of murder in the first degree,\n\n\"include parole eligibility.\"     Ante at    .

Were Massachusetts to\n\nabandon its system of parole, art. 26 would only require that\n\njuveniles convicted of murder in the first degree -- and thus\n\nsentenced to life -- be afforded some opportunity for release\n\nfrom imprisonment through a demonstration of rehabilitation, the\n\nonly constitutionally available penological justification for\n\nthe State's harshest penalty.   Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2468 (\"this\n\nmandatory punishment [of life without parole] disregards the\n\npossibility of rehabilitation even when the circumstances most\n\nsuggest it\").   In such a hypothetical scenario, art. 26 would\n\nnot require parole for any juvenile sentenced to a term of years\n\nbecause that sentence -- or any other lesser sentence -- has a\n\npenological justification other than rehabilitation.    See id. at\n\n2465-2466 (outlining penological justifications of sentences as\n\napplied to juveniles).\n\n    In constitutionally guaranteeing that juveniles convicted\n\nof murder in the first degree are eligible for parole, we have\n\nalready previously respected juveniles' constitutional\n\f                                                                        5\n\n\ndistinctiveness from adults convicted of murder in the first\n\ndegree by the imposition of a sentence that is not cruel and\n\nunusual.   By imposing today these additional procedural\n\nprotections, the court reaches beyond the judicial function of\n\nsentencing to regulate the conduct of the initial parole hearing\n\nitself, the manifestation of the executive prerogative to\n\nexecute the sentence.    In so doing, the court transforms the\n\nconduct of the parole hearing into part of the sentencing\n\nprocess, at least for juveniles convicted of murder in the first\n\ndegree, and implicates the action of the board in the sentence\n\nitself.\n\n    The Legislature never intended such a relationship between\n\nsentence and parole.    Moreover, it is something that we\n\nexpressly said in Cole, 468 Mass. at 302, is forbidden, because\n\nsentencing is \"a quintessential judicial power.\"    Id., quoting\n\nCommonwealth v.

Today we\n\nare dealing with the opposite scenario, in which the court\n\nsubsumes the executive power to regulate the conduct of a parole\n\nhearing into part of the sentencing process.\n\f                                                                      6\n\n\n    If the court's decision should be considered not to have\n\nrendered the conduct of the initial parole hearing of a juvenile\n\nconvicted of murder in the first degree part of the sentencing\n\nprocess, then the court's justification for \"additional\n\nprocedural protections\" in such a hearing fails because\n\n\"children are constitutionally different from adults for\n\npurposes of sentencing\" (emphasis added).      Diatchenko I, 466\n\nMass. at 670, quoting Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2465.     Parole is not\n\npart of the sentencing process and thus the parole hearing need\n\nnot recognize the difference between children and adults for\n\npurposes of art. 26.\n\n    The Supreme Court specifically identified traditional\n\nparole hearings as capable of providing that \"meaningful\n\nopportunity to obtain release.\"     Graham, 560 U.S. at 75.   In\n\nboth Graham and Miller, the Court even went so far as to\n\nexplicitly state that \"a State is not required to guarantee\n\neventual freedom.\"     Miller 132 S. Ct. at 2469; Graham, supra.\n\nThe term \"meaningful opportunity\" was a warning that the Eighth\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution \"forbid[s] States\n\nfrom making the judgment at the outset that those offenders\n\nnever will be fit to reenter society\" (emphasis added).

Indeed, in Diatchenko I we recognized that \"[o]ur\n\ndecision should not be construed to suggest that individuals who\n\nare under the age of eighteen when they commit murder in the\n\nfirst degree necessarily should be paroled once they have served\n\na statutorily designated portion of their sentences.\"\n\nDiatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 674.   These statements cannot be\n\nreconciled with the court's reasoning today that the \"process\"\n\nof the initial parole hearing of a juvenile convicted of murder\n\nin the first degree \"takes on a different constitutional\n\ndimension that does not exist for other offenders whose\n\nsentences include parole eligibility.\"    Ante at    .\n\n    Absent the recognition of a new liberty interest in the\n\noutcome of parole, the court does not explain the constitutional\n\nnecessity of these additional protections but simply inserts a\n\f                                                                     8\n\n\nnew \"constitutional dimension.\"    This \"constitutional dimension\"\n\nidentified by the court is the foundation for the new\n\nconstitutional rule that juveniles convicted of murder in the\n\nfirst degree require different procedural protections from those\n\ngiven to other offenders.   The court provides juveniles under a\n\nmandatory life sentences with enhanced procedures that no others\n\nreceive, yet there has been no suggestion that the parole\n\nhearing others receive falls short of a meaningful opportunity.\n\nWe have never previously stated or hinted at such a difference\n\nin procedural safeguards.   In Diatchenko I, we determined that\n\nthe appropriate remedy to the defendant's challenge under Miller\n\nwas to leave intact as much of the statutory scheme designed by\n\nthe Legislature as possible, so far as it remained\n\nconstitutional.   Diatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 673.    Accordingly,\n\nwe struck down only the provision making juveniles ineligible\n\nfor parole and let the remaining provisions of the statute\n\nstand.   Id.

Brown, 466\n\f                                                                      9\n\n\nMass. at 680.   In so doing, this court upheld the trial judge's\n\ndecision to impose \"as much of the sentencing scheme set forth\n\nin [the statute] as would be permissible in light of Miller's\n\nprohibition against mandatory sentences of life without parole\n\nfor juveniles.\"     Id.   We would not have instructed trial judges\n\nto apply the statute in a manner that preserved as much of the\n\nexpressed intent of the Legislature as possible if we intended\n\nto create a process different from that provided for in the\n\nthen-existing statutory scheme.\n\n    More recently, in Ray, we expressed a view that the normal\n\nprocedures governing consideration of parole release would apply\n\nto juveniles convicted of murder in the first degree.      Ray, 467\n\nMass. at 139-140.    \"Pursuant to our holding in Diatchenko, . . .\n\nthe defendant's life sentence remains in force, but the\n\nexception in G.

The court concludes that juveniles\n\nconvicted of murder in the first degree who seek parole\n\nconstitutionally are entitled to representation by counsel\n\nbecause a parole hearing is a contested, complex proceeding\n\nsimilar to that involving the termination of parental rights.\n\nTherefore, because juveniles convicted of murder in the first\n\ndegree -- imprisoned at a young age -- are unlikely to advocate\n\nas fully as possible for themselves and a parole hearing is\n\nsimilar to a proceeding terminating parental rights, the court\n\nconcludes that constitutionally guaranteed access to counsel\n\nbest ensures that the parole hearing is a \"meaningful\n\nopportunity.\"   I disagree.\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\n     The court's analogy between parental right termination\n\nproceedings and parole hearings does not withstand closer\n\nscrutiny.

The only reason Quegan\ncontradicts the court's conclusion that G. L. c. 211D, § 5, is\nthe appropriate authorization mechanism is because the court\nbaldly asserts that the class of inmates at issue requires a\ndifferent sort of parole hearing with additional procedural\nprotections from a hearing available to any other class applying\nfor parole. Juveniles convicted of murder in the first degree\ndo not merit anything more than a chance to appear before the\nboard in the same manner as other inmates do. To grant them\ngreater protection creates a perverse incentive.\n\f                                                                  14\n\n\nexpectation of parole, a juvenile convicted of murder in the\n\nfirst degree has no protected liberty interest, or right, to\n\nlose.3\n\n     Our decision in Diatchenko I did not suggest that the\n\ncurrent parole process did not adequately provide a \"meaningful\n\nopportunity to obtain release.\"   We most certainly did not\n\nsuggest that publicly funded counsel is necessary to protect\n\none's interest in a fair hearing.

Hawaii is the only State to grant a right to\ncounsel at parole release and review hearings by statute. Haw.\nRev. Stat. § 706-670(3)(b), (c). Should the Massachusetts\nLegislature take similar action, the debate here would be moot.\n\f                                                                   16\n\n\ncurrent parole process requires the board to consider the\n\ncircumstances of the crime, including whether Diatchenko and\n\nRoberio were juveniles at its commission, and whether they have\n\nbeen rehabilitated.   Additionally, numerous inmates convicted of\n\nmurder in the second degree as juveniles have been paroled after\n\nrelease hearings conducted without the aid of appointed counsel.\n\nWhile \"lifer hearings\" certainly require considerable\n\npreparation, the board is not called upon to resolve disputed\n\nissues of fact, strict rules of evidence do not apply, and\n\nwitnesses need not be subjected to cross-examination.\n\n     The court maintains that an attorney is needed to collect\n\nmaterials pertaining to a juvenile homicide offender's criminal\n\nhistory and personal development after conviction.   However, at\n\nthe time of a parole hearing, the factual record in these cases\n\nalready has been well established either in a trial transcript\n\nor in a decision of this court.   Additionally, the Department of\n\nCorrection (department) keeps a historical record containing\n\ndetailed medical, psychiatric, and disciplinary records in each\n\ninmate's six-part folder.   103 Code Mass. Regs. § 155.07 (2014).\n\nThese records are available to Diatchenko and Roberio before\n\ntheir hearings and to the board for review.5   See G. L. c. 127,\n\n\n     5\n       The court highlights that an inmate's access to this\ninformation may be restricted. Ante at     . The issue of what\nmay or may not be restricted in these circumstances is best left\n\f                                                                   17\n\n\n§ 135; 103 Code Mass.

Finally, and notably, the court\n\ndoes not suggest that the statutory standard for granting parole\n\nor the requirements for membership to the board are\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n    3.   Expert witness funds.   The court also concludes that a\n\nparole-eligible juvenile convicted of murder in the first degree\n\nmay petition a Superior Court judge to authorize the payment of\n\nfees to retain an expert witness to explain effectively \"the\n\neffects of the individual's neurobiological immaturity and other\n\npersonal circumstances at the time of the crime, and how this\n\ninformation relates to the individual's present capacity and\n\nfuture risk of reoffending.\"   Ante at    .   The majority derives\n\nthis right from the same mistaken interpretation that a\n\n\"meaningful opportunity\" of parole grants juveniles convicted of\n\nmurder in the first degree more rights in a parole hearing than\n\nany other class of inmate.   For substantially the same reasons\n\nthat a juvenile convicted of murder in the first degree is not\n\nguaranteed access to counsel, neither is he or she guaranteed\n\naccess to funds for expert witness testimony.\n\n\n\nto another day, but I note that the Department of Correction\nmust \"make every effort to disclose all evaluative information\nwhich is reasonably segregable from\" certain enumerated\ncategories to an inmate. 103 Code Mass.

The court construes G. L. c. 261, §§ 27A-27G, as\n\nauthorizing the expenditure of public funds because the parole\n\nhearing at issue is constitutionally mandated.

At issue in Conceicao\n\nwas the question whether \"meaningful access\" included access to\n\ncounsel as of right.     Id. at 258.   We concluded that the\n\ndecision to grant access to counsel for the preparation of a\n\nmotion for a new trial was within the discretion of the motion\n\njudge.   Id. at 262.   We recommended counsel only in the event\n\nthe defendant demonstrated a colorable or meritorious issue.\n\nId.   Importantly, we recognized that not every inmate need be\n\nplaced on exactly the same footing as any other by providing\n\ncounsel in order to guarantee meaningful access.      Id. at 261.\n\n      General Laws c. 261, § 27C (4), echoes the legislative\n\nacknowledgment that \"meaningful access\" does not necessarily\n\nrequire the blanket authorization of public funds in support of\n\f                                                                      19\n\n\na defendant's efforts following his direct appeal.     This section\n\nauthorizes provision of public funds needed by an indigent\n\napplicant for an \"effective . . . prosecution, defense or\n\nappeal.\"    Yet funds under the statute are generally not\n\navailable to support a defendant's effort to obtain\n\npostconviction relief, because those proceedings are not a part\n\nof the prosecution, defense, or appeal.    See Commonwealth v.\n\nArriaga, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569 (2003).\n\n     Finally, according to its enabling statute, members of the\n\nboard must come from a diverse background, including the fields\n\nof psychology or psychiatry.    G. L. c. 27, § 4.   Additionally,\n\nat least one member of the board must now have experience in\n\nforensic psychology, St. 2014, c. 189 (1), and the board must\n\nconsider scientific and technical factors at its hearings.      The\n\nboard now is obligated to consider youth-related factors in\n\norder to fulfil the mandates of both Miller and Diatchenko.6\n\nThese requirements assist in ensuring that Diatchenko's and\n\nRoberio's hearings provide a truly \"meaningful opportunity\" for\n\nrelease, without a need for their own experts.\n\n     4.

Consequently, lacking any\n\naffirmative power, a court could only set aside a decision of\n\nthe board and then remand the matter to the board, a process\n\nthat could be repeated ad infinitum until the board grants\n\nparole.   See Woods, 351 Mass. at 559.   Not only are courts ill-\n\nequipped to decide whether parole should be granted, but such a\n\ndecision -- both historically and legally -- has been reserved\n\nfor the executive branch.\n\n     The court notes that judicial review by an action for\n\ncertiorari would not encompass whether a particular juvenile\n\nconvicted of murder in the first degree is entitled to release\n\non parole but rather would be limited to the question whether\n\nthe board has \"constitutionally exercised\" its discretion.

Importantly,\n\nthe review process for granting parole is currently based on\n\ncomprehensive, individualized assessments.   In determining\n\nwhether a particular inmate is suitable for parole, the board is\n\ncharged by statute with ascertaining the extent to which the\n\ninmate has been rehabilitated, and the extent to which, if\n\nreleased, he or she would pose a risk to the community.7   See\n\n\n     7\n       \"Decisions of the Executive Branch, however serious their\nimpact, do not automatically invoke due process protection;\nthere simply is no constitutional guarantee that all executive\ndecisionmaking must comply with standards that assure error-free\ndeterminations.\" Greenholtz v.

This latter conclusion requires the board to\nassess whether, in light of the nature of the crime, the\ninmate's release will minimize the gravity of the offense,\nweaken the deterrent impact on others, and undermine respect for\nthe administration of justice.

Eventually, the\n\nboard's decision becomes a public record.   G. L. c. 127, § 130.\n\n    Further, in January, 2014, in response to Miller, the\n\nLegislature passed \"An Act relative to juvenile life sentences\n\nfor first degree murder\" (act).   St. 2014, c. 189.    The act\n\nimposed a series of statutory changes affecting juveniles\n\nconvicted of murder in the first degree including new sentencing\n\nand parole eligibility standards; mandating that at least one\n\nmember of the board have experience in forensic psychology;\n\nauthorizing the department to provide treatment and programming\n\nfor youthful offenders irrespective of their crimes or duration\n\nof incarceration; and allowing the placement of qualified\n\nyouthful offenders in a minimum security correctional facility,\n\nirrespective of their life sentence.   The act further\n\nestablished a commission to\n\n    \"study and determine the usefulness and practicality of\n    creating a developmental evaluation process for all cases\n    of first degree murder committed by a juvenile [between the\n    ages of fourteen and eighteen].

See note 1, supra.\n\nAccordingly, inmates like the defendant now must be \"evaluated\n\nwith recognition of the distinctive attributes of youth,\n\nincluding immaturity, impetuosity, and a failure to appreciate\n\nrisks and consequences.\"    See Diatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 675\n\n(Lenk, J., concurring).    The guidelines now provide that the\n\nboard can and should consider, among other things, the specific\n\nfacts of the crime and rehabilitation.    Finally, in determining\n\nwhether the inmate has been rehabilitated, the guidelines\n\nprovide that the board shall consider his or her conduct while\n\nincarcerated.\n\n    Had this court intended to directly oversee the board's\n\nconsideration of parole, we would have specifically provided\n\nguidance concerning the proper balance of the necessary factors\n\nor when to find that parole is warranted.    Yet, we declined to\n\ndo so, specifically holding that it was in the board's \"purview\"\n\f                                                               27\n\n\nto evaluate the unique circumstances and conditions of the\n\ndefendant.   Diatchenko I, 466 Mass. at 674.   See Doe v.\n\nMassachusetts Parole Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass. App. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 861 (2012).\n\nThis the board has done by revising its guidelines.\n\nAccordingly, a complaint for declaratory relief remains the best\n\nmanner to ensure the meaningfulness of parole hearings by\n\nallowing challenges to procedural elements of these hearings\n\nsuch as the guidelines.   See Nelson, 390 Mass. at 388 n.12.\n\nThere has been no showing that declaratory relief would be\n\nappropriate at this time.\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\f     CORDY, J. (dissenting, with whom Spina, J., joins).    I join\n\nand agree completely with Justice Spina's dissent.   I write\n\nseparately only to underscore my strongly held view that the\n\njudicial branch should not intrude on what is plainly an\n\nexecutive branch function in the absence of a showing that that\n\nbranch has failed to fulfil its legal or constitutional\n\nobligations.   There is not a hint of such a showing in this\n\ncase.    To the contrary, all indicators of executive branch\n\nintentions support the conclusion that \"meaningful\n\nopportunit[ies] to obtain release\" on parole have been and will\n\ncontinue to be provided to individuals serving life sentences\n\nfor murders they committed when they were juveniles.    There is\n\nno demonstrated need for the court to construct and order funded\n\na special parole and appellate process for such prisoners.1\n\n     While the directives in the court's ruling regarding\n\ncounsel, appeals, and the funding of experts may seem relatively\n\nbenign to some, in unnecessarily intruding on the functions of\n\nanother branch the court steps over the line that separates the\n\npowers accorded to each in our constitutional structure -- a\n\nseparation we have proudly proclaimed as a necessary element of\n\na constitutional democracy that ensures our government shall be\n\n     1\n       Indeed, as the court's opinion has noted, Gregory\nDiatchenko already has been granted parole.\n\f                                                                     2\n\n\none of laws and not of men.2    In doing so, the court also fails\n\nto accord the other branches the respect necessary to the proper\n\nfunctioning of a government where each has its own\n\nconstitutional responsibilities.    While the role of the\n\njudiciary may often include being a check on the other branches\n\nwhen they exceed or fail in the execution of those\n\nresponsibilities, it is distinctly not to exercise them.3\n\nAlthough we occasionally declare that the Massachusetts\n\nDeclaration of Rights creates certain duties in other branches,\n\nsuch as ensuring a meaningful opportunity for release on parole,\n\nwe leave it to those branches \"to define the precise nature of\n\nthe task[s] which they face in fulfilling\" those duties.\n\nMcDuffy v. Secretary of the Exec. Office of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2136358\"><a href=\"/opinion/2136358/mcduffy-v-sec-of-the-executive-office-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 620 (1993).    To hold that such a meaningful opportunity can\n\nonly occur in the context of a parole hearing with counsel\n\nappointed, experts on retainer, and a special appellate process,\n\n\n     2\n         See art. 29 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\n     3\n       Last year, we were quick to declare that the community\nparole supervision for life law (G. L. c. 127, § 133D [a]) was\nan unconstitutional delegation of a quintessential judicial\nfunction, sentencing, to the parole board, an executive branch\nof government, in violation of the constitutional separation of\npowers clause at issue here. Commonwealth v. Cole, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">294</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 302 (2014). In so doing, we also underscored and confirmed\nthat the granting of parole is \"a discretionary act\" and a\n\"function of the executive branch of government with which, if\notherwise constitutionally exercised, the judiciary may not\ninterfere\" (emphasis added). Id.\n\f                                                                   3\n\n\nis to declare that we know best how to perform the tasks\n\nconstitutionally assigned to others, in the absence of any\n\nevidence of failure or excess.4   This substitution at this\n\njuncture of our judgment for that of the parole board as to the\n\nexpertise and advocacy necessary for it to properly exercise its\n\nexecutive discretion is a slippery slope, and one down which we\n\nshould not embark.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       There is no suggestion in the court's opinion that the\nstandard for determining an individual's suitability for parole\nfor persons convicted of murder when they were juveniles is any\ndifferent from the standard of suitability that any other\nprisoner must satisfy in order to obtain release on parole,\ni.e., that there is a \"reasonable probability that, if the\nprisoner is released with appropriate conditions and community\nsupervision, the prisoner will live and remain at liberty\nwithout violating the law, and that release is not incompatible\nwith the welfare of society.\" G. L. c. 127, § 130.\n\f</pre>",
