FILED: October 12, 2015\n\n      Spearman, C.J. â€” In 2007, Susan Kirchoff sued the Department of Social\n\nand Health Services (DSHS), alleging that its investigation of her home during\n\n1979-1980 was negligent and resulted in Kirchoff remaining in the home with her\n\nsexually abusive stepfather. The trial court dismissed Kirchoffs claim as time\n\nbarred. Under RCW 4.16.340, a claim based on childhood sexual abuse may be\n\nbrought within three years of the time the victim discovers the causal connection\n\nbetween the wrongful act and her injury. We hold that a genuine question of fact\n\nexists as to when Kirchoff made the causal connection between DSHS's failure\n\nto act and her injury. We reverse and remand.\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/2\n\n\n                                              FACTS\n\n\n        The facts of the case are largely uncontested. In 1979, Susan Kirchoff and\n\nher two older sisters, aged 13, 14, and 17, lived with their mother and their\n\nstepfather, Lotus Cassidy. The middle sister, C.B., disclosed to her school\n\ncounselor that Cassidy was sexually abusing her.1 The counselor contacted\n\nChild Protective Services (CPS).\n\n        Ann Watkins, a CPS social worker, investigated. Cassidy and the girls'\n\nmother denied the abuse and accused C.B. of making up stories to seek\n\nattention. Although the oldest sister, N.B., was pregnant, she denied being\n\nabused by Cassidy and initially denied being sexually active. Watkins stated that\n\nKirchoff also denied the abuse. However, Watkins could not actually recall\n\nspeaking with Kirchoff and the parties disputed whether Watkins ever interviewed\n\nKirchoff.\n\n\n        C.B. did not want to remain in the home, and her mother allowed CPS to\n\nimmediately place her in foster care without a court order. On December 10,\n\n1979, C.B. took a polygraph test that indicated that her allegations about the\n\nsexual abuse were truthful. On January 7, 1980, officers from the Kelso Police\n\nDepartment questioned Cassidy about the allegations. When told that a\n\npolygraph examination confirmed C.B.'s story, Cassidy admitted that he had\n\nengaged in sexual intercourse with both C.B. and N.B. and had \"gotten fresh\"\n\n\n         1 Individuals who were minor children at the time of the allegations and are not parties to\nthis lawsuit are referred to by initials to maintain their privacy.\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/3\n\n\nwith Kirchoff. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 33-34. Cassidy was charged with indecent\n\nliberties in regards to C.B. and returned home to await trial. A dependency\n\nhearing was subsequently held for N.B. and the court ordered her removed from\n\nthe home and placed in foster care.\n\n      At that time, Kirchoff was not aware that CPS had investigated the family\n\nand placed her sisters in foster homes because of the sexual abuse. Cassidy told\n\nKirchoff that everything he did to her and her sisters was pleasurable and was to\n\nprepare them for married life. Kirchoff's mother told her that C.B.'s lies had gotten\n\nthe family in trouble and that C.B. left because she wanted to live in a nicer\n\nhouse. Kirchoff stated that Cassidy continued to abuse her until about April,\n\n1980, when she went to stay with relatives who lived out of state.\n\n       As an adult, Kirchoff experienced symptoms including anxiety, depression,\n\nirritability, and sexual aversions. She sought counseling and received treatment\n\non various occasions. Kirchoff connected her symptoms to the abuse she had\n\nsuffered as a child and worked hard to overcome the symptoms and forgive her\n\nstepfather.\n\n       In 2002, Kirchoff and her husband applied to DSHS for a foster care\n\nlicense and also applied to become adoptive parents. On both applications,\n\nKirchoff stated that she had been sexually abused as a child. She stated that her\n\nsisters had been placed in foster homes because of the abuse and she did not\n\nknow why she had not been placed in foster care.\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/4\n\n\n        In 2007, Kirchoff attended a class offered by DSHS to become a foster\n\nhome licensor. During instruction about the duties of CPS, the instructor used a\n\nhypothetical in which CPS investigated allegations of abuse and removed two\n\ngirls from a home but left a third, who then suffered further abuse. The instructor\n\nstated that this would be deficient performance by CPS. Upon hearing this,\n\nKirchoff asserts that she realized for the first time that CPS had failed in its duty\n\nto protect her from further abuse and that she was injured as a result. After\n\nmaking this connection, Kirchoff felt betrayed. Her symptoms of irritability, anger,\n\nand depression were renewed. She also developed a gambling problem and\n\nfurther sexual aversion.\n\n\n        In 2008, Kirchoff consulted a psychologist, Dr. Laura Brown. Dr. Brown\n\ndiagnosed aggravation of preexisting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n\nattributable to betrayal trauma.2 Betrayal trauma theory explains the trauma\n\nexperienced as a result of feeling betrayed, as, for instance, when an individual\n\nor institution fails in a protective duty. Kirchoff suffered psychological distress as\n\na result of learning that CPS should have protected her, and this distress\n\naggravated her preexisting PTSD. Dr. Brown also stated that it would be \"difficult\n\nto separate\" the treatment necessary as a result of the PTSD that resulted from\n\nbetrayal and the preexisting PTSD due to the abuse. CP at 208. \"When you are\n\ntreating PTSD, you are treating PTSD, so the betrayal trauma aggravates the\n\n\n\n        2 Dr. Brown described all of Ms. Kirchoffs preexisting symptoms as symptoms of PTSD.\nWhile Ms. Kirchoff had received treatment for these symptoms previously, there is no indication\nthat she had received a diagnosis of PTSD prior to meeting with Dr. Brown.\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/5\n\n\ntrauma related to the sexual abuse. You can't in treatment really segregate them\none from the other.\" Id.\n\n         Kirchoff brought suit against DSHS in 2009.3 DSHS moved for summary\n\njudgment on the grounds that Kirchoff's claim was time barred and that she had\n\nfailed to establish the elements of her negligent investigation claim. The trial\n\ncourt granted summary judgment for DSHS. The court ruled that Kirchoff's claim\n\nwas time barred because her 2007 discoveries about DSHS concerned only the\n\nlegal basis for her claim, not facts about DSHS's actions. The trial court also\n\nruled that betrayal trauma was not a qualitatively different harm from that which\n\nKirchoff had previously attributed to the abuse.4 The court did not address\n\nDSHS's argument that Kirchoff had failed to establish the elements of her claim.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n        We review a summary judgment order de novo. Camicia v. Howard S.\n\nWright Constr. Co.. 179 Wn.2d 684, 693, 317 P.3d 987 (2014). Summary\n\njudgment based on the statute of limitations is appropriate only when there is no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding when the statutory period began. Young\n\nSoo Kim v. Choong-Hvun Lee. 174 Wn. App. 319, 323, 300 P.3d 431 (2013); CR\n\n\n\n        3 Kirchoff joined the City of Kelso and Cowlitz County to the suit, but voluntarily dismissed\nthese parties.\n         4 DSHS also argued that Dr. Brown's testimony concerning \"betrayal trauma\" was\ninadmissible under Frve v. United States. 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923). Under the Frve standard,\nexpert testimony is admissible only where both \"the theory underlying the evidence and the\nmethodology used to implement the theory\" are generally accepted in the scientific community.\nLake Chelan Shores Homeowners Ass'n v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 176 Wn. App. 168,\n175, 313 P.3d 408, 412 (2013) (citing State v. Gregory. 158 Wn.2d 759, 829-30, 147 P.3d 1201\n(2006)), review denied, 179 Wn.2d 1019, 318 P.3d 280 (2014).The trial court assumed, without\ndeciding, that the diagnosis of \"betrayal trauma\" satisfied the Frve requirements.\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/6\n\n\n56(c). Where reasonable minds could draw more than one conclusion on the\n\nevidence, summary judgment is not appropriate. Smith v. Safeco Ins. Co., 150\n\nWn.2d 478, 485, 78 P.3d 1274 (2003); Morris v. McNicol, 83 Wn.2d 491, 494-95,\n\n519 P.2d 7 (1974). The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense and the\n\ndefendant bears the burden of proof. Korst v. McMahon. 136 Wn. App. 202, 208,\n\n148 P.3d 1081 (2006). We perform the same inquiry as the trial court, review the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and draw all\n\nreasonable inferences in the nonmoving party's favor. Lakev v. Puget Sound\n\nEnergy, Inc., 176 Wn.2d 909, 922, 296 P.3d 860 (2013).\n\n      RCW 4.16.340 establishes limitations for claims of childhood sexual\n\nabuse. The statute provides in relevant part:\n\n         (1) All claims or causes of action based on intentional conduct\n      brought by any person for recovery of damages for injury\n      suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse shall be\n      commenced within the later of the following periods:\n\n           (a) Within three years of the act alleged to have caused the\n       injury or condition;\n\n          (b) Within three years of the time the victim discovered or\n       reasonably should have discovered that the injury or condition\n      was caused by said act; or\n\n         (c) Within three years of the time the victim discovered that\n      the act caused the injury for which the claim is brought....\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/7\n\n\n\n       At issue in this appeal is subsection (1)(c).5 That subsection applies where\n\nthe victim is aware of the abuse and aware that she suffered harm as a result,\n\nbut discovers a new and qualitatively different injury attributable to the abuse.\n\nCarollo v. Dahl. 157 Wn. App. 796, 801.240P.3d 1172(2010). It also applies\n\nwhere the victim is aware of the abuse and aware of her injury, but discovers a\n\ncausal connection, of which she was previously unaware, between the wrongful\n\nact and her harm. Hollmann. 89 Wn. App. at 325. Kirchhoff contends that her\n\nclaim falls within both applications of subsection (1)(c).\n\n        Kirchofffirst argues that she brought her claim within three years of\n\nsuffering a new injury connected to the abuse, betrayal trauma. A claim of\n\nchildhood sexual abuse may be brought within three years of the time that the\n\nvictim discovers an injury that is \"qualitatively different from other harms\n\nconnected to the abuse which the plaintiff had experienced previously.\" Carollo.\n\n157 Wn. App. at 801. \"[M]ore severe manifestations of a prior injury\" are not\n\nqualitatively different and are not within provision (1)(c). Id. at 803. The trial court\n\nconcluded as a matter of law that Kirchoff had failed to establish that her\n\ndiagnosis of betrayal trauma was qualitatively different from the injuries of which\n\nshe had previously been aware, i.e., anxiety, depression, irritability, etc. The\n\nevidence in the record supports the trial court's ruling.\n\n\n        5 Kirchoff also argues that her claim falls within subsection (b), but the argument is\nwithout merit. It is well settled that that subsection applies to cases involving repressed memory,\n\"where the victim discovers his or her injury or condition was caused by a previously\nundiscovered act.\" Hollmann v. Corcoran. 89 Wn. App. 323, 334, 949 P.2d 386 (1997). That\ncircumstance is not present in this case.\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/8\n\n\n       Kirchoff's expert, Dr. Brown, diagnosed aggravation of preexisting PTSD\n\nattributable to betrayal trauma. Dr. Brown stated that Kirchoff suffered\n\npsychological distress as a result of learning that CPS should have protected her,\n\nand this distress caused her to experience renewed symptoms of PTSD.\n\nHowever, Dr. Brown also stated that Kirchoffs PTSD predated her 2007\n\ndiscovery of DSHS's alleged negligence and that the symptoms had \"waxed and\n\nwaned\" throughout her adult life. Dr. Brown explained betrayal trauma as\n\n\"aggravat[ing] the trauma related to the sexual abuse,\" and stated that the\n\nsymptoms caused by the betrayal trauma could not be segregated from those\n\ncaused by the abuse. CP at 208.\n\n       Because the betrayal trauma resulted in a recurrence and aggravation of a\n\npreexisting injury that Kirchoff was aware of prior to 2007, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt's ruling that the diagnosis of betrayal trauma was not a discovery of a new\n\ninjury within RCW 4.16.340(1 )(c).\n\n       RCW 4.16.340(1 )(c) also applies when a victim discovers the causal link\n\nbetween the wrongful act and her injury. Carollo, 157 Wn. App. at 801. DSHS\n\nargues that RCW 4.16.340(1 )(c) applies only to the discovery of a causal\n\nconnection between the act of abuse and the victim's injury, not to the discovery\n\nof a causal connection between a third party's negligence and the victim's injury.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n      C.J.C. v. Corp. of Catholic Bishop of Yakima. 138 Wn.2d 699, 709-10, 985\n\nP.2d 262 (1999), is instructive. In that case, various religious organizations\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/9\n\n\nargued that RCW 4.16.340 did not apply to negligence claims against third\n\nparties because, by the statute's plain language, it applies to \"[a]ll claims or\n\ncauses of action based on intentional conduct. . ..\" RCW 4.16.340(1); C.J.C\n\n138 Wn.2d at 706-707 (emphasis added). The court rejected this argument\n\nbecause \"an action is 'based on intentional conduct' if intentional sexual abuse is\n\nthe starting point or foundation of the claim.\" ]d. at 709. In a negligence claim\n\nagainst a third party, \"intentional sexual abuse is the predicate conduct. .. .\" jd.\n\nat 709. The Court thus held that \"RCW 4.16.340 encompasses causes of action\n\nsounding in negligence against parties who did not themselves directly\n\nperpetrate acts of childhood sexual abuse, but who allegedly failed to protect\n\nchild victims or to otherwise prevent the abuse.\" ]d. at 714.\n\n       The C.J.C. court noted that this interpretation is consistent with the\n\nstatutory scheme as a whole and with the Legislature's intent \"to provide a broad\n\navenue of redress for victims of childhood sexual abuse who too often were left\n\nwithout a remedy under previous statutes of limitation.\" Id, at 712-713. It is also\n\nconsistent with the \"strong public policy in favor of protecting children against\n\nacts of sexual abuse.\" Id. at 726. The Court further noted that the application of\n\nRCW 4.16.340 to negligence claims \"is consistent with our cases recognizing a\n\nduty to prevent intentionally inflicted harm where the defendant is in a special\n\nrelationship with ... the victim, and where the defendant is or should be aware of\n\nthe risk.\" Id. at 724. In such a case, the focus of the court's inquiry is \"not on\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/10\n\n\nwhere or when the harm occurred, but on whether the [third party] negligently\n\ncaused the harm . . . when the risk was, or should have been, known.\" Id.\n\n       Here, as in C.J.C the intentional act of abuse is the predicate conduct on\n\nwhich the claim is based. Thus, RCW 4.16.340(1 )(c) is equally applicable to the\n\nvictim who makes a causal connection between intentional abusive conduct and\n\ninjury and the victim who makes a causal connection between a third party's\n\nnegligent failure to protect and injury.\n\n       DSHS also argues that the statute of limitations began to run on Kirchoff's\n\nclaim when she discovered the factual basis of her claim. DSHS asserts that\n\nKirchoff had discovered at least by 2002 that her sisters had been placed in\n\nfoster homes due to the abuse and, for reasons unknown to her, she was not.\n\nRelying on Allen v. State. 118 Wn.2d 753, 826 P.2d 200 (1992), DSHS argues\n\nthat based on the facts Kirchoff knew in 2002, she had a duty to inquire whether\n\na cause of action was available to her. DSHS is incorrect.\n\n       Allen, in addressing the general statute of limitation, RCW 4.16.080(2),\n\nheld that \"[t]he action accrues when the plaintiff knows or should know the\n\nrelevant facts, whether or not the plaintiff also knows that these facts are enough\n\nto establish a legal cause of action.\" Allen. 118 Wn.2d at 758. But a different\n\nstatute is involved here. Unlike the general statute of limitation in Allen. RCW\n\n4.16.340(1 )(c) does not impose a duty of discovery on the plaintiff. Allen. 118\n\nWn.2d at 758; Korst. 136 Wn. App. at 207-208; Hollman, 89 Wn. App. at 334.\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/11\n\n\n       While RCW 4.16.340(1 )(b) begins to run when the victim \"discovered or\n\nreasonably should have discovered that the injury or condition was caused by\n\nsaid act,\" subsection (1)(c) omits the phrase \"or should have discovered.\" RCW\n\n4.16.340. This omission is consistent with the Legislature's recognition that the\n\n\"victim of childhood sexual abuse may be unable to understand or make the\n\nconnection between childhood sexual abuse and emotional harm or damage until\n\nmany years after the abuse occurs.\" Laws of 1991, ch. 212, Â§ 1. RCW\n\n4.16.340(1)(c) thus applies a subjective standard, and requires analysis of when\n\nthe victim actually discovered the causal connection. Korst. 136 Wn. App. at 207-\n\n208; Hollman. 89 Wn. App. at 334.6\n\n        In the present case, the inquiry is when in fact Kirchoff discovered the\n\ncausal connection between DSHS's allegedly negligent investigation and her\n\ninjuries. Based on the evidence on the record, a jury could find that Kirchoff did\n\nnot subjectively make the connection between DSHS's failure to act and her\n\ninjury until 2007. Summaryjudgment based on the statute of limitations was thus\n\nimproper.\n\n        DSHS also moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Kirchoff\n\nfailed to establish breach or causation in her negligent investigation claim. The\n\ntrial court did not address this argument, but DSHS urges us to consider it here.\n\n\n          6We also reject Kirchoffs contention that RCW 4.16.340(1 )(c) begins to run when the\nplaintiff discovers her cause of action. She argues that she discovered her cause of action in\n2007 when she learned that DSHS owed her a duty of protection and had breached that duty.\nHowever, the inquiry under (1)(c) is not when the plaintiff discovered a legal claim, but when she\nin fact became aware of a causal connection between the defendant's act and her injury. Korst,\n136 Wn. App. at 207-208; Hollmann, 89 Wn. App. at 325.\n\n\n                                                11\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/12\n\n\nWe may affirm the superior court's ruling on any grounds adequately supported\n\nby the record. Fulton v. Dep't of Soc. & Health Servs.. 169 Wn. App. 137, 147,\n\n279 P.3d 500 (2012).\n\n      A negligent investigation claim arises from the State's statutory duty under\n\nRCW 26.44.050 to investigate allegations of child abuse. Tvner v. Dep't of Soc. &\n\nHealth Servs.. 14 Wn.2d 68, 1 P.3d 1148 (2000). To prevail on a claim for\n\nnegligent investigation, the plaintiff must prove that DSHS conducted a faulty\n\ninvestigation and that the faulty investigation caused a harmful placement\n\ndecision. M.W. v. Dep't of Soc. & Health Servs., 149 Wn.2d 589, 602, 70 P.3d\n\n954 (2003); Petcu v. Dep't of Soc. & Health Servs.. 121 Wn. App. 36, 56, 86 P.3d\n\n1234 (2004). A placement decision is harmful if it removes a child from a\n\nnonabusive home, lets a child remain in an abusive home, or places a child in an\n\nabusive home. M.W.. 149 Wn.2d at 595.\n\n      The record includes statements from Ann Watkins, the investigating social\n\nworker, that the investigation was conducted according to the standards and\n\nprocedures in place at the time, including interviewing Kirchoff separately from\n\nher mother and stepfather. However, this testimony is disputed. Kirchoff and her\n\nmother both stated that CPS never interviewed Kirchoff. The record includes\n\ndeclarations from two experts who opine that CPS conducted a negligent\n\ninvestigation. The record establishes a question offact as to whether DSHS's\n\ninvestigation was negligent.\n\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/13\n\n\n       DSHS also argues that Kirchoff did not establish causation because even\n\nif its investigation was faulty, that investigation was not the cause of Kirchoff\n\nbeing left in her stepfather's home. Watkins stated that at the time in question\n\nCPS did not have the authority to remove a child from her home. However,\n\nWatkins also stated that CPS could, at the time, ask the county prosecutor to\n\nseek dependency. She did not recall if CPS had made such a request concerning\n\nKirchoff or if CPS was involved in the decision to seek a court order removing\n\nN.B., but not Kirchoff, from the home.

FILED: October 12, 2015\n\n      Spearman, C.J. â€” In 2007, Susan Kirchoff sued the Department of Social\n\nand Health Services (DSHS), alleging that its investigation of her home during\n\n1979-1980 was negligent and resulted in Kirchoff remaining in the home with her\n\nsexually abusive stepfather. The trial court dismissed Kirchoffs claim as time\n\nbarred. Under RCW 4.16.340, a claim based on childhood sexual abuse may be\n\nbrought within three years of the time the victim discovers the causal connection\n\nbetween the wrongful act and her injury. We hold that a genuine question of fact\n\nexists as to when Kirchoff made the causal connection between DSHS's failure\n\nto act and her injury. We reverse and remand.\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/2\n\n\n                                              FACTS\n\n\n        The facts of the case are largely uncontested. In 1979, Susan Kirchoff and\n\nher two older sisters, aged 13, 14, and 17, lived with their mother and their\n\nstepfather, Lotus Cassidy. The middle sister, C.B., disclosed to her school\n\ncounselor that Cassidy was sexually abusing her.1 The counselor contacted\n\nChild Protective Services (CPS).\n\n        Ann Watkins, a CPS social worker, investigated. Cassidy and the girls'\n\nmother denied the abuse and accused C.B. of making up stories to seek\n\nattention. Although the oldest sister, N.B., was pregnant, she denied being\n\nabused by Cassidy and initially denied being sexually active. Watkins stated that\n\nKirchoff also denied the abuse. However, Watkins could not actually recall\n\nspeaking with Kirchoff and the parties disputed whether Watkins ever interviewed\n\nKirchoff.\n\n\n        C.B. did not want to remain in the home, and her mother allowed CPS to\n\nimmediately place her in foster care without a court order. On December 10,\n\n1979, C.B. took a polygraph test that indicated that her allegations about the\n\nsexual abuse were truthful. On January 7, 1980, officers from the Kelso Police\n\nDepartment questioned Cassidy about the allegations. When told that a\n\npolygraph examination confirmed C.B.'s story, Cassidy admitted that he had\n\nengaged in sexual intercourse with both C.B. and N.B. and had \"gotten fresh\"\n\n\n         1 Individuals who were minor children at the time of the allegations and are not parties to\nthis lawsuit are referred to by initials to maintain their privacy.\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/3\n\n\nwith Kirchoff. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 33-34. Cassidy was charged with indecent\n\nliberties in regards to C.B. and returned home to await trial. A dependency\n\nhearing was subsequently held for N.B. and the court ordered her removed from\n\nthe home and placed in foster care.\n\n      At that time, Kirchoff was not aware that CPS had investigated the family\n\nand placed her sisters in foster homes because of the sexual abuse. Cassidy told\n\nKirchoff that everything he did to her and her sisters was pleasurable and was to\n\nprepare them for married life. Kirchoff's mother told her that C.B.'s lies had gotten\n\nthe family in trouble and that C.B. left because she wanted to live in a nicer\n\nhouse. Kirchoff stated that Cassidy continued to abuse her until about April,\n\n1980, when she went to stay with relatives who lived out of state.\n\n       As an adult, Kirchoff experienced symptoms including anxiety, depression,\n\nirritability, and sexual aversions. She sought counseling and received treatment\n\non various occasions. Kirchoff connected her symptoms to the abuse she had\n\nsuffered as a child and worked hard to overcome the symptoms and forgive her\n\nstepfather.\n\n       In 2002, Kirchoff and her husband applied to DSHS for a foster care\n\nlicense and also applied to become adoptive parents. On both applications,\n\nKirchoff stated that she had been sexually abused as a child. She stated that her\n\nsisters had been placed in foster homes because of the abuse and she did not\n\nknow why she had not been placed in foster care.\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/4\n\n\n        In 2007, Kirchoff attended a class offered by DSHS to become a foster\n\nhome licensor. During instruction about the duties of CPS, the instructor used a\n\nhypothetical in which CPS investigated allegations of abuse and removed two\n\ngirls from a home but left a third, who then suffered further abuse. The instructor\n\nstated that this would be deficient performance by CPS. Upon hearing this,\n\nKirchoff asserts that she realized for the first time that CPS had failed in its duty\n\nto protect her from further abuse and that she was injured as a result. After\n\nmaking this connection, Kirchoff felt betrayed. Her symptoms of irritability, anger,\n\nand depression were renewed. She also developed a gambling problem and\n\nfurther sexual aversion.\n\n\n        In 2008, Kirchoff consulted a psychologist, Dr. Laura Brown. Dr. Brown\n\ndiagnosed aggravation of preexisting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n\nattributable to betrayal trauma.2 Betrayal trauma theory explains the trauma\n\nexperienced as a result of feeling betrayed, as, for instance, when an individual\n\nor institution fails in a protective duty. Kirchoff suffered psychological distress as\n\na result of learning that CPS should have protected her, and this distress\n\naggravated her preexisting PTSD. Dr. Brown also stated that it would be \"difficult\n\nto separate\" the treatment necessary as a result of the PTSD that resulted from\n\nbetrayal and the preexisting PTSD due to the abuse. CP at 208. \"When you are\n\ntreating PTSD, you are treating PTSD, so the betrayal trauma aggravates the\n\n\n\n        2 Dr. Brown described all of Ms. Kirchoffs preexisting symptoms as symptoms of PTSD.\nWhile Ms. Kirchoff had received treatment for these symptoms previously, there is no indication\nthat she had received a diagnosis of PTSD prior to meeting with Dr. Brown.\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/5\n\n\ntrauma related to the sexual abuse. You can't in treatment really segregate them\none from the other.\" Id.\n\n         Kirchoff brought suit against DSHS in 2009.3 DSHS moved for summary\n\njudgment on the grounds that Kirchoff's claim was time barred and that she had\n\nfailed to establish the elements of her negligent investigation claim. The trial\n\ncourt granted summary judgment for DSHS. The court ruled that Kirchoff's claim\n\nwas time barred because her 2007 discoveries about DSHS concerned only the\n\nlegal basis for her claim, not facts about DSHS's actions. The trial court also\n\nruled that betrayal trauma was not a qualitatively different harm from that which\n\nKirchoff had previously attributed to the abuse.4 The court did not address\n\nDSHS's argument that Kirchoff had failed to establish the elements of her claim.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n        We review a summary judgment order de novo.

Hollmann. 89 Wn. App. at 325. Kirchhoff contends that her\n\nclaim falls within both applications of subsection (1)(c).\n\n        Kirchofffirst argues that she brought her claim within three years of\n\nsuffering a new injury connected to the abuse, betrayal trauma. A claim of\n\nchildhood sexual abuse may be brought within three years of the time that the\n\nvictim discovers an injury that is \"qualitatively different from other harms\n\nconnected to the abuse which the plaintiff had experienced previously.\" Carollo.\n\n157 Wn.

The trial court\n\nconcluded as a matter of law that Kirchoff had failed to establish that her\n\ndiagnosis of betrayal trauma was qualitatively different from the injuries of which\n\nshe had previously been aware, i.e., anxiety, depression, irritability, etc. The\n\nevidence in the record supports the trial court's ruling.\n\n\n        5 Kirchoff also argues that her claim falls within subsection (b), but the argument is\nwithout merit.

That\ncircumstance is not present in this case.\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/8\n\n\n       Kirchoff's expert, Dr. Brown, diagnosed aggravation of preexisting PTSD\n\nattributable to betrayal trauma. Dr. Brown stated that Kirchoff suffered\n\npsychological distress as a result of learning that CPS should have protected her,\n\nand this distress caused her to experience renewed symptoms of PTSD.\n\nHowever, Dr. Brown also stated that Kirchoffs PTSD predated her 2007\n\ndiscovery of DSHS's alleged negligence and that the symptoms had \"waxed and\n\nwaned\" throughout her adult life. Dr. Brown explained betrayal trauma as\n\n\"aggravat[ing] the trauma related to the sexual abuse,\" and stated that the\n\nsymptoms caused by the betrayal trauma could not be segregated from those\n\ncaused by the abuse. CP at 208.\n\n       Because the betrayal trauma resulted in a recurrence and aggravation of a\n\npreexisting injury that Kirchoff was aware of prior to 2007, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt's ruling that the diagnosis of betrayal trauma was not a discovery of a new\n\ninjury within RCW 4.16.340(1 )(c).\n\n       RCW 4.16.340(1 )(c) also applies when a victim discovers the causal link\n\nbetween the wrongful act and her injury.

The court rejected this argument\n\nbecause \"an action is 'based on intentional conduct' if intentional sexual abuse is\n\nthe starting point or foundation of the claim.\" ]d. at 709. In a negligence claim\n\nagainst a third party, \"intentional sexual abuse is the predicate conduct. .. .\" jd.\n\nat 709. The Court thus held that \"RCW 4.16.340 encompasses causes of action\n\nsounding in negligence against parties who did not themselves directly\n\nperpetrate acts of childhood sexual abuse, but who allegedly failed to protect\n\nchild victims or to otherwise prevent the abuse.\" ]d. at 714.\n\n       The C.J.C. court noted that this interpretation is consistent with the\n\nstatutory scheme as a whole and with the Legislature's intent \"to provide a broad\n\navenue of redress for victims of childhood sexual abuse who too often were left\n\nwithout a remedy under previous statutes of limitation.\" Id, at 712-713. It is also\n\nconsistent with the \"strong public policy in favor of protecting children against\n\nacts of sexual abuse.\" Id. at 726. The Court further noted that the application of\n\nRCW 4.16.340 to negligence claims \"is consistent with our cases recognizing a\n\nduty to prevent intentionally inflicted harm where the defendant is in a special\n\nrelationship with ... the victim, and where the defendant is or should be aware of\n\nthe risk.\" Id. at 724. In such a case, the focus of the court's inquiry is \"not on\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/10\n\n\nwhere or when the harm occurred, but on whether the [third party] negligently\n\ncaused the harm . . . when the risk was, or should have been, known.\" Id.\n\n       Here, as in C.J.C the intentional act of abuse is the predicate conduct on\n\nwhich the claim is based. Thus, RCW 4.16.340(1 )(c) is equally applicable to the\n\nvictim who makes a causal connection between intentional abusive conduct and\n\ninjury and the victim who makes a causal connection between a third party's\n\nnegligent failure to protect and injury.\n\n       DSHS also argues that the statute of limitations began to run on Kirchoff's\n\nclaim when she discovered the factual basis of her claim. DSHS asserts that\n\nKirchoff had discovered at least by 2002 that her sisters had been placed in\n\nfoster homes due to the abuse and, for reasons unknown to her, she was not.\n\nRelying on Allen v.

This omission is consistent with the Legislature's recognition that the\n\n\"victim of childhood sexual abuse may be unable to understand or make the\n\nconnection between childhood sexual abuse and emotional harm or damage until\n\nmany years after the abuse occurs.\" Laws of 1991, ch. 212, Â§ 1.

App. at 334.6\n\n        In the present case, the inquiry is when in fact Kirchoff discovered the\n\ncausal connection between DSHS's allegedly negligent investigation and her\n\ninjuries. Based on the evidence on the record, a jury could find that Kirchoff did\n\nnot subjectively make the connection between DSHS's failure to act and her\n\ninjury until 2007. Summaryjudgment based on the statute of limitations was thus\n\nimproper.\n\n        DSHS also moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Kirchoff\n\nfailed to establish breach or causation in her negligent investigation claim. The\n\ntrial court did not address this argument, but DSHS urges us to consider it here.\n\n\n          6We also reject Kirchoffs contention that RCW 4.16.340(1 )(c) begins to run when the\nplaintiff discovers her cause of action. She argues that she discovered her cause of action in\n2007 when she learned that DSHS owed her a duty of protection and had breached that duty.\nHowever, the inquiry under (1)(c) is not when the plaintiff discovered a legal claim, but when she\nin fact became aware of a causal connection between the defendant's act and her injury.

A placement decision is harmful if it removes a child from a\n\nnonabusive home, lets a child remain in an abusive home, or places a child in an\n\nabusive home. M.W.. 149 Wn.2d at 595.\n\n      The record includes statements from Ann Watkins, the investigating social\n\nworker, that the investigation was conducted according to the standards and\n\nprocedures in place at the time, including interviewing Kirchoff separately from\n\nher mother and stepfather. However, this testimony is disputed. Kirchoff and her\n\nmother both stated that CPS never interviewed Kirchoff. The record includes\n\ndeclarations from two experts who opine that CPS conducted a negligent\n\ninvestigation. The record establishes a question offact as to whether DSHS's\n\ninvestigation was negligent.\n\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\fNo. 73666-3-1/13\n\n\n       DSHS also argues that Kirchoff did not establish causation because even\n\nif its investigation was faulty, that investigation was not the cause of Kirchoff\n\nbeing left in her stepfather's home. Watkins stated that at the time in question\n\nCPS did not have the authority to remove a child from her home. However,\n\nWatkins also stated that CPS could, at the time, ask the county prosecutor to\n\nseek dependency. She did not recall if CPS had made such a request concerning\n\nKirchoff or if CPS was involved in the decision to seek a court order removing\n\nN.B., but not Kirchoff, from the home. The record establishes a question of fact\n\nconcerning whether the allegedly negligent investigation caused the harmful\n\nplacement decision.\n\n       Genuine questions of fact exist as to when Kirchoff discovered the causal\n\nconnection between DSHS's allegedly negligent investigation and her injury and\n\nwhether DSHS conducted a negligent investigation that resulted in a harmful\n\nplacement decision. We accordingly reverse and remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \\d\n                                                     V) â‚¬<? f^rsc.y^       I y\\JÂ»\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n                                                       â€”^\n                                          13\n\f</pre>",
