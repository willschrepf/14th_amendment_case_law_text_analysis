Rizzo claims that she was\n\nremoved from her van driving duties at Children’s World because of\n\nher   hearing   impairment.      The   district   court   granted   summary\n\njudgment in favor of Children’s World.            Finding that a genuine\n\nissue of material fact exists as to whether Rizzo is a qualified\n\n\n      1\n       District Judge         for the Eastern District of Louisiana,\nsitting by designation.\n\findividual with a disability, we reverse the district court’s\n\nsummary judgment and remand for trial.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n     Rizzo began working at Children’s World as a teacher’s aide in\n\nMarch 1991.      She had a hearing impairment that required the use of\n\nhearing aids, which she disclosed to Children’s World on her job\n\napplication.      Her duties at Children’s World included assisting in\n\nthe classroom, doing administrative paperwork and driving children\n\nin the Children’s World van.\n\n     In February 1993, a parent complained to Children’s World\n\nDirector Myra Ryan about Rizzo being left alone with children,\n\ngiven her hearing impairment.           The parent also expressed concern\n\nover Rizzo’s ability to drive the van safely.                     Director Ryan\n\ndiscussed the complaint with Rizzo and Rizzo admitted that she had\n\nexperienced further hearing loss and was scheduled to see her\n\ndoctor to determine if stronger hearing aids were necessary.\n\nDirector Ryan asked Rizzo whether she could hear a child choking in\n\nthe back of the van.         Rizzo said that she did not know if she could\n\nhear a choking child, but she thought that it was safe for her to\n\ndrive the children.\n\n     Rizzo was removed from her driving responsibilities until she\n\ncould bring a report from her audiologist stating that it was safe\n\nfor her to drive the van.             On March 11, 1993, Rizzo brought a\n\nreport   from    her    audiologist    which    said   that   she   could    hear\n\nemergency vehicles.          However, the report did not discuss whether\n\nRizzo    could   hear    a    child   choking   at   the   back   of   the   van.\n\n\n                                        2\n\fChildren’s World told Rizzo that before she could drive the van it\n\nneeded that information.             Rizzo said that the audiologist would\n\nhave    to    observe    her    at   work    to   make    that    determination     and\n\nChildren’s World said that this was acceptable.                   Nevertheless, the\n\naudiologist never observed Rizzo and no further report on her\n\nability to hear a choking child was ever sent to Children’s World.\n\n       After    Rizzo’s       removal     from    her   driving    duties,    she   was\n\nassigned food preparation duties previously performed by Children’s\n\nWorld’s cook.      She was asked to work a split shift (early mornings\n\nand late afternoons) and her hours were reduced.                      Rizzo asserts\n\nthat as a result of Children’s World’s actions, she lost respect\n\namong her peers and she was shamed by having to prove that it was\n\nsafe for her to drive the children.\n\n       Children’s World contends that the reason Rizzo worked a split\n\nschedule and cooked meals was that she requested that she not be\n\nplaced in a classroom by herself for more than thirty minutes at a\n\ntime,    and    that    she    not   be    placed   with    school    age    children.\n\nTherefore, their actions were a reasonable accommodation for her\n\ndisability, not discriminatory acts.                     Children’s World further\n\nmaintains that Rizzo remained a full-time employee and was not\n\ndemoted.\n\n       Rizzo resigned her position with Children’s World on May 20,\n\n1993.        She then filed a complaint with the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission, which issued her a right to sue letter.\n\nRizzo then filed suit against Children’s World in federal district\n\ncourt under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42\n\n\n                                            3\n\fU.S.C. § 12101, et seq., alleging that because of her hearing\n\nimpairment   she   was    (1)   wrongfully          demoted,   (2)   discriminated\n\nagainst and (3) wrongfully perceived to be a direct threat to the\n\nhealth or safety of herself or others in the work place.                   She also\n\nalleges   that     Children’s     World        failed     to    make     reasonable\n\naccommodation for her disability.\n\n                    II.    THE DISTRICT COURT OPINION\n\n     The district court applied the McDonnell Douglas Title VII\n\nburden shifting paradigm.2        McDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S.\n\n792 (1973); Texas Dep’t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S.\n\n248 (1981). Applying the McDonnell Douglas framework, the district\n\ncourt found that Rizzo met her prima facie case of showing that\n\n“she was a disabled person who was ‘otherwise qualified’ to perform\n\nher job duties.”    The district court found that she was “otherwise\n\nqualified”   because      she   could,       with    reasonable      accommodation,\n\nperform the essential functions of her position.                       The district\n\ncourt found that there was “a relatively inexpensive device [which]\n\nmight have been placed in the van to amplify sounds coming from\n\nbehind the driver,” thereby accommodating any disability she might\n\nhave.\n\n     Because Rizzo met her prima facie case, the district court\n\n     2\n        We recently made clear that the Title VII burden shifting\nframework applies in ADA cases. Daigle v. Liberty Life Ins. Co.,\n70 F.3d 394, 396 (5th Cir. 1995).      This is the same approach\nfollowed by other circuits. See Newman v. GHS Osteopathic, Inc.,\n60 F.2d 153, 157 (3d Cir. 1995); DeLuca v. Winer Indus., Inc., 53\nF.3d 793, 797 (7th Cir. 1995); Ennis v. National Ass’n of Business\n& Educ. Radio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 57 (4th Cir. 1995); Smith v.\nBarton, 914 F.2d 1330, 1339-40 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 501 U.S.\n1217 (1991).\n\n                                         4\n\fshifted the burden to Children’s World to show a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its decision to temporarily remove her\n\nfrom driving duties.     The district court found that Children’s\n\nWorld met this burden because its statement that it removed Rizzo\n\nbecause she might not hear a choking child was a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason.\n\n       The district court then placed the burden on Rizzo to come\n\n“forward with a genuine issue of fact as to whether Children’s\n\nWorld’s accommodations were discriminatory or unreasonable.”      The\n\ndistrict court found that Rizzo did not meet this burden and, thus,\n\nheld that as a matter of law Children’s World did not violate the\n\nADA.\n\n                       III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       We review district court orders granting summary judgment de\n\nnovo, applying the same standards as the district court. Harper v.\n\nHarris County, Texas, 21 F.3d 597, 599 (5th Cir. 1994).     Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law.”    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n       As we recently said:\n\n                 Summary judgment is proper if the movant\n            demonstrates that there is an absence of genuine\n            issues of material fact. Such a showing entitles\n            the movant to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n            The movant accomplishes this by informing the court\n            of the basis for its motion, and by identifying\n            portions of the record which highlight the absence\n            of genuine factual issues.        Once the movant\n            produces such evidence, the nonmovant must then\n            direct the court’s attention to evidence in the\n            record sufficient to establish that there is a\n            genuine issue of material fact for trial -- that\n\n                                  5\n\f            is, the nonmovant must come forward with evidence\n            establishing each of the challenged elements of its\n            case for which the nonmovant will bear the burden\n            of proof at trial.\n\n                 The nonmovant can satisfy its burden by\n            tendering   depositions,  affidavits,   and   other\n            competent evidence to buttress its claim. . . .\n            Summary judgment is appropriate, therefore, if the\n            nonmovant fails to set forth specific facts, by\n            affidavits or otherwise, to show there is a genuine\n            issue for trial.\n\nTopalian v. Ehrman, 954 F.2d 1125, 1131-31 (5th Cir.1992), cert.\n\ndenied, 506 U.S. 825 (1992) (internal citations omitted).\n\n     When a party moves for summary judgment on an issue for which\n\nit bears the burden of proof at trial, it must demonstrate the\n\nabsence of a fact issue as to that issue.      Lindsey v. Sears Roebuck\n\n& Co., 16 F.3d 616, 618 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\n                              IV. DISCUSSION\n\n     The district court improperly analyzed this case. This is not\n\na circumstantial evidence case, where we apply the McDonnell\n\nDouglas   burden   shifting   framework;   rather,   this   is   a   direct\n\nevidence case.     Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S.\n\n111, 121 (1985).\n\n     A plaintiff can prove discrimination in two ways, either “by\n\ndirect evidence or by an indirect or inferential method of proof.\n\nDiscrimination can be shown indirectly by following the ‘pretext’\n\nmethod of proof set out in McDonnell Douglas.”         Mooney v. Aramco\n\nServices, Co., 54 F.3d 1207, 1216 (5th Cir. 1995)(internal citation\n\nomitted).    “The shifting burdens of proof set forth in McDonnell\n\nDouglas are designed to assure that the plaintiff has his day in\n\ncourt despite the unavailability of direct evidence.”        Trans World\n\n                                    6\n\fAirlines, 469 U.S. at 121 (internal quotations omitted); see\n\nMooney, 54 F.3d at 1217.            “In the rare situation in which the\n\nevidence establishes that an employer openly discriminates against\n\nan individual it is not necessary to apply the mechanical formula\n\nof McDonnell Douglas to establish an inference of discrimination.”\n\nMoore v. U.S.D.A., 55 F.3d 991, 995 (5th Cir. 1995); see Trans\n\nWorld Airlines, 469 U.S. at 121 (“[T]he McDonnell Douglas test is\n\ninapplicable     where    the   plaintiff   presents     direct       evidence      of\n\ndiscrimination.”).\n\n     In the instant case there is direct evidence that Children’s\n\nWorld   made    an   employment     decision   because      of    a       disability.\n\nChildren’s World does not deny that Rizzo was removed from driving\n\nduties because of her hearing impairment.             Therefore, we need not\n\nengage in the McDonnell Douglas presumptions in order to infer\n\ndiscrimination: Children’s World admits that it discriminated.\n\nChildren’s     World,    however,   contends   that    it   had       a    reason   to\n\ndiscriminate. It argues that Rizzo’s driving of the van would pose\n\na direct threat to the children, because she might not be able to\n\nhear if one of them was choking.\n\n     The ADA provides that “[n]o covered entity shall discriminate\n\nagainst a qualified individual with a disability because of the\n\ndisability of such individual in regard to . . . [the] terms,\n\nconditions, and privileges of employment.”             42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).\n\nA “qualified individual with a disability” is “an individual with\n\na disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can\n\nperform the essential functions of the employment position that\n\n\n                                       7\n\fsuch individual holds or desires.”        Id. § 12111(8); Daugherty v.\n\nCity of El Paso, 56 F.3d 695, 696 (5th Cir. 1995), cert. denied,\n\n116 S. Ct. 1263 (1996).\n\n       The fact that the district court incorrectly applied the law\n\ndoes not end our inquiry; we must still examine the record.         If we\n\nfind that there is no genuine issue of material fact, we will\n\naffirm the summary judgment, albeit on different grounds. Brothers\n\nv. Klevenhagen, 28 F.3d 452, 457 n.7 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 115\n\nS. Ct. 639 (1994).     Therefore, we will examine the entire case to\n\ndetermine if there is a fact issue.\n\n       To prevail on her ADA claim, Rizzo must prove that (1) she has\n\na disability; (2) she was         qualified for the job; and (3) an\n\nadverse   employment   decision    was   made   solely   because   of   her\n\ndisability. Doe v. University of Maryland Medical System Corp., 50\n\nF.3d 1261, 1265 (4th Cir. 1995); Chiari v. City of League City, 920\n\nF.2d 311, 315 (5th Cir. 1991) (Rehabilitation Act of 1973 case).\n\nA.     Disability\n\n       A “disability” is “a physical or mental impairment that\n\nsubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities of\n\n[the] individual.” 42 U.S.C. §12112(a). Children’s World does not\n\ncontest that a hearing impairment is a disability, or that Rizzo is\n\ndisabled.    Therefore, summary judgment for Children’s World is\n\ninappropriate on the issue of whether Rizzo is disabled under the\n\nADA.\n\n\n\n\n                                    8\n\fB. Qualified to do the Job\n\n        Rizzo has the burden of proving that she can perform, with or\n\nwithout reasonable accommodation, all of the essential elements of\n\nher job.        Doe,    50   F.3d   at    1264;    Chiarai,      920   F.2d   at   315.\n\nChildren’s World put on summary judgment evidence showing that\n\nRizzo is not a qualified individual with a disability, because she\n\ncould not perform an essential element of the job, namely, driving\n\nthe bus safely.        Children’s World pointed out that Rizzo might not\n\nbe able to hear a child choking in the back of the van, thus she\n\nwas a direct threat to the children.               Rizzo countered by bringing\n\nforth evidence showing that she possessed all required licenses to\n\nbe able to drive the bus.           She also presented testimony from her\n\naudiologist that she could hear emergency vehicles.\n\n        The question is not whether Rizzo could hear a choking child.\n\nThere is no evidence that an essential element of the job is the\n\nability to hear a choking child.3              Instead, the question is whether\n\nthe person is able to safely drive the van and not present a direct\n\nthreat     to   the    children’s        safety.         The    ADA    provides    that\n\n“‘qualification        standards’    may       include    a    requirement    that   an\n\nindividual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety\n\nof other individuals in the work place.”                      42 U.S.C. § 12113(b).\n\nThe regulations define a direct threat as:\n\n\n\n\n    3\n       Indeed, there is no evidence that a choking child makes any\nnoise, let alone exactly what sound the child would make. It is\npossible that even a driver with perfect hearing could not hear a\nchild choking in the back of the van.\n\n                                           9\n\f           a significant risk of substantial harm to the\n           health or safety of the individual or others that\n           cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable\n           accommodation.      The   determination   that   an\n           individual poses a “direct threat” shall be based\n           on an individualized assessment of the individual’s\n           present ability to safely perform the essential\n           functions of the job.    This assessment shall be\n           based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies\n           on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the\n           best available objective evidence. In determining\n           whether an individual would pose a direct threat,\n           the factors to be considered include:\n                (1) The duration of the risk;\n                (2) The nature and severity of the potential\n                harm;\n                (3) The likelihood that the potential harm\n                will occur; and\n                (4) The imminence of the potential harm.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(r); see School Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline,\n\n480 U.S. 273, 287-88 (1987) (Rehabilitation Act of 1973 case).\n\nWhether one is a direct threat is a complicated, fact intensive\n\ndetermination, not a question of law.            To determine whether a\n\nparticular individual performing a particular act poses a direct\n\nrisk to others is a matter for the trier of fact to determine after\n\nweighing all of the evidence about the nature of the risk and the\n\npotential harm.\n\n     An   employee   who   is   a   direct   threat   is   not   a   qualified\n\nindividual with a disability.         As with all affirmative defenses,\n\nthe employer bears the burden of proving that the employee is a\n\ndirect threat. See Interpretive Guidance to 29 C.F.R. § 1630.15(b)\n\n& (c)(“With regard to safety requirements that screen out or tend\n\nto screen out an individual with a disability or a class of\n\nindividuals with disabilities, an employer must demonstrate that\n\nthe requirement, as applied to the individual, satisfies the\n\n\n                                      10\n\f‘direct threat’ standard in section 1630.2(r) in order to show that\n\nthe   requirement     is     job   related      and    consistent    with   business\n\nnecessity”)(emphasis added).               Therefore, to prevail on summary\n\njudgment on the direct threat issue, Children’s World must prove\n\nthat Rizzo is a direct threat as a matter of law.                  Lindsey, 16 F.3d\n\nat 618.\n\n      We previously addressed direct threat in the driving context\n\nin Daugherty, 56 F.3d 695 (ADA case) and Chandler v. City of\n\nDallas, 2 F.3d 1385 (5th Cir. 1993) (Rehabilitation Act of 1973\n\ncase), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1386 (1994).                   Both cases involved\n\ninsulin dependent diabetics who were not allowed to drive city\n\nvehicles.      In     both      cases    government        rules   and    regulations\n\nspecifically prohibited insulin dependent diabetics from driving\n\nfor   the   cities.        In    fact,    the   United      States   Department    of\n\nTransportation regulations prohibit insulin dependent diabetics\n\nfrom operating large trucks or buses.                 49 C.F.R. §§ 383.5, 383.23,\n\n383.71, 391.41 (1994); Daugherty, 56 F.3d at 697.                  Because the risk\n\npresented by insulin dependent drivers is so great, we have held,\n\n“as a matter of law, [that] a driver with insulin dependent\n\ndiabetes . . . presents a genuine substantial risk that he could\n\ninjure himself or others.”              Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1395.\n\n      The situation presented in the instant case is different.\n\nChildren’s    World    has      pointed    us   to    no   statute   or    regulation\n\nregarding hearing-impaired drivers.              Texas has no requirement that\n\nits day care workers meet certain minimum hearing requirements. We\n\ndo not have voluminous caselaw regarding the dangers presented by\n\n\n                                           11\n\fhearing impaired drivers.     Cf. Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1395 (citing\n\ncases regarding dangers posed by insulin dependent diabetics).     No\n\nevidence was presented regarding the ability of anyone to hear a\n\nchoking child while driving a van.      Children’s World only pointed\n\nout a lack of evidence on the issue of Rizzo’s ability to hear a\n\nchoking child.    Rizzo countered with evidence showing that it was\n\nsafe for her to drive the van.         Whether a person who can hear\n\nemergency vehicles, but cannot hear a choking child, is a direct\n\nthreat is a question of fact.     Therefore, there exists a genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to whether Rizzo is a direct threat, and\n\nthus, whether she was a qualified individual with a disability.\n\nBecause there is a genuine issue of material fact, summary judgment\n\nis inappropriate.\n\n     In deciding whether Rizzo’s hearing impairment presents a\n\ndirect threat, the factfinder should of course weigh heavily the\n\nfact that Rizzo drives a van carrying small children.       That any\n\npotential harm will befall children, the most vulnerable members of\n\nour society, will greatly impact the consideration of “[t]he nature\n\nand severity of the potential harm.”      29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(r).   We\n\nwholeheartedly agree with the district judge's statement that “the\n\nhealth and safety of the children [is Children’s World’s] primary\n\nconsideration.”     Our opinion should in no way be interpreted as\n\nlessening the protection offered to children.         Rather, we are\n\nmerely saying that, at this time, there is a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether Rizzo is a direct threat, making\n\nsummary judgment inappropriate.\n\n\n                                  12\n\fC. Adverse Employment Decision\n\n     In addition to proving that she is a qualified individual with\n\na disability, Rizzo must also prove that Children’s World took an\n\nadverse    employment   action   solely     because   of    her    disability.\n\nChildren’s World argues that it took no adverse employment action\n\nat all, but merely worked to accommodate Rizzo’s disability.\n\n     Specifically, Rizzo argues that Children’s World (1) removed\n\nher from her driving duties (2) reduced her hours, (3) forced her\n\nto work a split shift and (4) forced her to work in the kitchen,\n\nwhich she found demeaning.       Children’s World maintains that Rizzo\n\nremained a    full-time   employee    and    her   hourly   wage    was   never\n\nreduced.   Any loss in hours was due to lowered enrollment, as well\n\nas Rizzo’s request to leave early in order to get to another job.\n\nThe split shift was due to Rizzo’s request that she not teach\n\nschool age children and that she not be alone in a classroom for\n\nmore than 30 minutes at a time.      The kitchen work, Children’s World\n\ncontends, was not demeaning, because everyone at the center helped\n\nwith food preparation.\n\n     The ADA prohibits discrimination in the “terms, conditions,\n\nand privileges of employment.”       42 U.S.C. § 12112.       This language\n\nis broad enough to encompass the actions Rizzo has alleged.                 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1630.5 (“[I]t is unlawful for a covered entity to limit,\n\nsegregate, or classify a[n] . . . employee in a way that adversely\n\naffects his or her employment opportunities or status on the basis\n\nof disability.”); Interpretive Guidance to 29 C.F.R. § 1630.5\n\n(“[I]t would be a violation . . . for an employer to limit the\n\n\n                                     13\n\fduties of an employee with a disability based on a presumption ...\n\nabout the abilities of an individual with such a disability.”).\n\nLowering someone’s hours, requiring them to work a split shift and\n\nchanging their duties from that of bus driver to cook is certainly\n\na change in the conditions of employment.\n\n      Children’s World raises several good points to rebut Rizzo’s\n\nclaims.   However, its arguments merely serve to illustrate that a\n\ngenuine issue exists which must be resolved by the jury.        In just\n\none   example,   Rizzo   says   kitchen   work   was   demeaning,   while\n\nChildren’s World claims that everyone helped out in the kitchen.\n\nA factfinder will have to determine whether consigning Rizzo to\n\nkitchen duty was an adverse action taken because of her disability.\n\nThus, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\n\nChildren’s World took an adverse employment action against Rizzo,\n\nand, again, summary judgment is inappropriate.\n\n                             V. CONCLUSION\n\n      We do not doubt that Children's World acted in good faith\n\nthroughout this matter, motivated by what it considered to be\n\nconcern for the children's safety. Nonetheless, there is a genuine\n\nfact issue regarding whether Rizzo poses a direct threat, making\n\nsummary judgment inappropriate.         Therefore, the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                   14\n\f",

Rizzo claims that she was removed from her van driving duties at Children's World because of her hearing impairment.   The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Children's World.   Finding that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Rizzo is a qualified individual with a disability, we reverse the district court's summary judgment and remand for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rizzo began working at Children's World as a teacher's aide in March 1991.   She had a hearing impairment that required the use of hearing aids, which she disclosed to Children's World on her job application.   Her duties at Children's World included assisting in the classroom, doing administrative paperwork and driving children in the Children's World van.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1993, a parent complained to Children's World Director Myra Ryan about Rizzo being left alone with children, given her hearing impairment.   The parent also expressed concern over Rizzo's ability to drive the van safely.   Director Ryan discussed the complaint with Rizzo and Rizzo admitted that she had experienced further hearing loss and was scheduled to see her doctor to determine if stronger hearing aids were necessary.   Director Ryan asked Rizzo whether she could hear a child choking in the back of the van.   Rizzo said that she did not know if she could hear a choking child, but she thought that it was safe for her to drive the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rizzo was removed from her driving responsibilities until she could bring a report from her audiologist stating that it was safe for her to drive the van.   On March 11, 1993, Rizzo brought a report from her audiologist which said that she could hear emergency vehicles.   However, the report did not discuss whether Rizzo could hear a child choking at the back of the van.   Children's World told Rizzo that before she could drive the van it needed that information.   Rizzo said that the audiologist would have to observe her at work to make that determination and Children's World said that this was acceptable.   Nevertheless, the audiologist never observed Rizzo and no further report on her ability to hear a choking child was ever sent to Children's World.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Rizzo's removal from her driving duties, she was assigned food preparation duties previously performed by Children's World's cook.   She was asked to work a split shift (early mornings and late afternoons) and her hours were reduced.   Rizzo asserts that as a result of Children's World's actions, she lost respect among her peers and she was shamed by having to prove that it was safe for her to drive the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Children's World contends that the reason Rizzo worked a split schedule and cooked meals was that she requested that she not be placed in a classroom by herself for more than thirty minutes at a time, and that she not be placed with school age children.   Therefore, their actions were a reasonable accommodation for her disability, not discriminatory acts.   Children's World further maintains that Rizzo remained a full-time employee and was not demoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rizzo resigned her position with Children's World on May 20, 1993.   She then filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which issued her a right to sue letter.   Rizzo then filed suit against Children's World in federal district court under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101, et seq., alleging that because of her hearing impairment she was (1) wrongfully demoted, (2) discriminated against, and (3) wrongfully perceived to be a direct threat to the health or safety of herself or others in the work place.   She also alleges that Children's World failed to make reasonable accommodation for her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE DISTRICT COURT OPINION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court applied the McDonnell Douglas Title VII burden shifting paradigm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  McDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973);  Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).   Applying the McDonnell Douglas framework, the district court found that Rizzo met her prima facie case of showing that \"she was a disabled person who was 'otherwise qualified' to perform her job duties.\"   The district court found that she was \"otherwise qualified\" because she could, with reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of her position.   The district court found that there was \"a relatively inexpensive device [which] might have been placed in the van to amplify sounds coming from behind the driver,\" thereby accommodating any disability she might have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Rizzo met her prima facie case, the district court shifted the burden to Children's World to show a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to temporarily remove her from driving duties.   The district court found that Children's World met this burden because its statement that it removed Rizzo because she might not hear a choking child was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then placed the burden on Rizzo to come \"forward with a genuine issue of fact as to whether Children's World's accommodations were discriminatory or unreasonable.\"   The district court found that Rizzo did not meet this burden and, thus, held that as a matter of law Children's World did not violate the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review district court orders granting summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court.  Harper v. Harris County, Texas, 21 F.3d 597, 599 (5th Cir.1994).   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As we recently said:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is proper if the movant demonstrates that there is an absence of genuine issues of material fact.   Such a showing entitles the movant to summary judgment as a matter of law.   The movant accomplishes this by informing the court of the basis for its motion, and by identifying portions of the record which highlight the absence of genuine factual issues.   Once the movant produces such evidence, the nonmovant must then direct the court's attention to evidence in the record sufficient to establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial--that is, the nonmovant must come forward with evidence establishing each of the challenged elements of its case for which the nonmovant will bear the burden of proof at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nonmovant can satisfy its burden by tendering depositions, affidavits, and other competent evidence to buttress its claim....  Summary judgment is appropriate, therefore, if the nonmovant fails to set forth specific facts, by affidavits or otherwise, to show there is a genuine issue for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Topalian v. Ehrman, 954 F.2d 1125, 1131-31 (5th Cir.1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 825, 113 S.Ct. 82, 121 L.Ed.2d 46 (1992) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a party moves for summary judgment on an issue for which it bears the burden of proof at trial, it must demonstrate the absence of a fact issue as to that issue.  Lindsey v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., 16 F.3d 616, 618 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court improperly analyzed this case.   This is not a circumstantial evidence case, where we apply the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting framework;  rather, this is a direct evidence case.  Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 121, 105 S.Ct. 613, 621-22, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff can prove discrimination in two ways, either \"by direct evidence or by an indirect or inferential method of proof.   Discrimination can be shown indirectly by following the 'pretext' method of proof set out in McDonnell Douglas.\"  Mooney v. Aramco Services, Co., 54 F.3d 1207, 1216 (5th Cir.1995) (internal citation omitted).  \"The shifting burdens of proof set forth in McDonnell Douglas are designed to assure that the plaintiff has his day in court despite the unavailability of direct evidence.\"  Trans World Airlines, 469 U.S. at 121, 105 S.Ct. at 622 (internal quotations omitted);  see Mooney, 54 F.3d at 1217.  \"In the rare situation in which the evidence establishes that an employer openly discriminates against an individual it is not necessary to apply the mechanical formula of McDonnell Douglas to establish an inference of discrimination.\"  Moore v. U.S.D.A., 55 F.3d 991, 995 (5th Cir.1995);  see Trans World Airlines, 469 U.S. at 121, 105 S.Ct. at 621-22 (\"[T]he McDonnell Douglas test is inapplicable where the plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case there is direct evidence that Children's World made an employment decision because of a disability.   Children's World does not deny that Rizzo was removed from driving duties because of her hearing impairment.   Therefore, we need not engage in the McDonnell Douglas presumptions in order to infer discrimination:  Children's World admits that it discriminated.   Children's World, however, contends that it had a reason to discriminate.   It argues that Rizzo's driving of the van would pose a direct threat to the children, because she might not be able to hear if one of them were choking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA provides that \"[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to ... [the] terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a).   A \"qualified individual with a disability\" is \"an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\"   Id. &#167; 12111(8);  Daugherty v. City of El Paso, 56 F.3d 695, 696 (5th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1263, 134 L.Ed.2d 211 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the district court incorrectly applied the law does not end our inquiry;  we must still examine the record.   If we find that there is no genuine issue of material fact, we will affirm the summary judgment, albeit on different grounds.  Brothers v. Klevenhagen, 28 F.3d 452, 457 n. 7 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 639, 130 L.Ed.2d 545 (1994).   Therefore, we will examine the entire case to determine if there is a fact issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail on her ADA claim, Rizzo must prove that (1) she has a disability;  (2) she was qualified for the job;  and (3) an adverse employment decision was made solely because of her disability.  Doe v. University of Maryland Medical System Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1265 (4th Cir.1995);  Chiari v. City of League City, 920 F.2d 311, 315 (5th Cir.1991) (Rehabilitation Act of 1973 case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Disability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"disability\" is \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [the] individual.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a).   Children's World does not contest that a hearing impairment is a disability, or that Rizzo is disabled.   Therefore, summary judgment for Children's World is inappropriate on the issue of whether Rizzo is disabled under the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Qualified to do the Job</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rizzo has the burden of proving that she can perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, all of the essential elements of her job.  Doe, 50 F.3d at 1264;  Chiari, 920 F.2d at 315.   Children's World put on summary judgment evidence showing that Rizzo is not a qualified individual with a disability, because she could not perform an essential element of the job, namely, driving the bus safely.   Children's World pointed out that Rizzo might not be able to hear a child choking in the back of the van, thus she was a direct threat to the children.   Rizzo countered by bringing forth evidence showing that she possessed all required licenses to be able to drive the bus.   She also presented testimony from her audiologist that she could hear emergency vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is not whether Rizzo could hear a choking child.   There is no evidence that an essential element of the job is the ability to hear a choking child.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Instead, the question is whether the person is able to safely drive the van and not present a direct threat to the children's safety.   The ADA provides that \" 'qualification standards' may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the work place.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12113(b).   The regulations define a direct threat as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.   The determination that an individual poses a \"direct threat\" shall be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job.   This assessment shall be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence.   In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The duration of the risk;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The nature and severity of the potential harm;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The likelihood that the potential harm will occur;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) The imminence of the potential harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(r);  see School Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287-88, 107 S.Ct. 1123, 1130-31, 94 L.Ed.2d 307 (1987) (Rehabilitation Act of 1973 case). Whether one is a direct threat is a complicated, fact intensive determination, not a question of law.   To determine whether a particular individual performing a particular act poses a direct risk to others is a matter for the trier of fact to determine after weighing all of the evidence about the nature of the risk and the potential harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An employee who is a direct threat is not a qualified individual with a disability.   As with all affirmative defenses, the employer bears the burden of proving that the employee is a direct threat.   See Interpretive Guidance to 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.15(b) &amp; (c) (\"With regard to safety requirements that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, an employer must demonstrate that the requirement, as applied to the individual, satisfies the 'direct threat' standard in section 1630.2(r) in order to show that the requirement is job related and consistent with business necessity\") (emphasis added).   Therefore, to prevail on summary judgment on the direct threat issue, Children's World must prove that Rizzo is a direct threat as a matter of law.  Lindsey, 16 F.3d at 618.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We previously addressed direct threat in the driving context in Daugherty, 56 F.3d 695 (ADA case) and Chandler v. City of Dallas, 2 F.3d 1385 (5th Cir.1993) (Rehabilitation Act of 1973 case), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1386, 128 L.Ed.2d 61 (1994).   Both cases involved insulin dependent diabetics who were not allowed to drive city vehicles.   In both cases government rules and regulations specifically prohibited insulin dependent diabetics from driving for the cities.   In fact, the United States Department of Transportation regulations prohibit insulin dependent diabetics from operating large trucks or buses.  49 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 383.5, 383.23, 383.71, and 391.41 (1994);  Daugherty, 56 F.3d at 697.   Because the risk presented by insulin dependent drivers is so great, we have held, \"as a matter of law, [that] a driver with insulin dependent diabetes ... presents a genuine substantial risk that he could injure himself or others.\"  Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1395.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation presented in the instant case is different.   Children's World has pointed us to no statute or regulation regarding hearing-impaired drivers.   Texas has no requirement that its day care workers meet certain minimum hearing requirements.   We do not have voluminous caselaw regarding the dangers presented by hearing impaired drivers.   Cf. Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1395 (citing cases regarding dangers posed by insulin dependent diabetics).   No evidence was presented regarding the ability of anyone to hear a choking child while driving a van.   Children's World only pointed out a lack of evidence on the issue of Rizzo's ability to hear a choking child.   Rizzo countered with evidence showing that it was safe for her to drive the van.   Whether a person who can hear emergency vehicles, but cannot hear a choking child, is a direct threat is a question of fact.   Therefore, there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Rizzo is a direct threat, and thus, whether she was a qualified individual with a disability.   Because there is a genuine issue of material fact, summary judgment is inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding whether Rizzo's hearing impairment presents a direct threat, the factfinder should of course weigh heavily the fact that Rizzo drives a van carrying small children.   That any potential harm will befall children, the most vulnerable members of our society, will greatly impact the consideration of \"[t]he nature and severity of the potential harm.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(r).   We wholeheartedly agree with the district judge's statement that \"the health and safety of the children [is Children's World's] primary consideration.\"   Our opinion should in no way be interpreted as lessening the protection offered to children.   Rather, we are merely saying that, at this time, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Rizzo is a direct threat, making summary judgment inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Adverse Employment Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to proving that she is a qualified individual with a disability, Rizzo must also prove that Children's World took an adverse employment action solely because of her disability.   Children's World argues that it took no adverse employment action at all, but merely worked to accommodate Rizzo's disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, Rizzo argues that Children's World (1) removed her from her driving duties, (2) reduced her hours, (3) forced her to work a split shift, and (4) forced her to work in the kitchen, which she found demeaning.   Children's World maintains that Rizzo remained a full-time employee and her hourly wage was never reduced.   Any loss in hours was due to lowered enrollment, as well as Rizzo's request to leave early in order to get to another job.   The split shift was due to Rizzo's request that she not teach school age children and that she not be alone in a classroom for more than 30 minutes at a time.   The kitchen work, Children's World contends, was not demeaning, because everyone at the center helped with food preparation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA prohibits discrimination in the \"terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112.   This language is broad enough to encompass the actions Rizzo has alleged.  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.5 (\"[I]t is unlawful for a covered entity to limit, segregate, or classify a[n] ... employee in a way that adversely affects his or her employment opportunities or status on the basis of disability.\");   Interpretive Guidance to 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.5 (\"[I]t would be a violation ... for an employer to limit the duties of an employee with a disability based on a presumption ... about the abilities of an individual with such a disability.\").   Lowering someone's hours, requiring them to work a split shift and changing their duties from that of bus driver to cook is certainly a change in the conditions of employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Children's World raises several good points to rebut Rizzo's claims.   However, its arguments merely serve to illustrate that a genuine issue exists which must be resolved by the jury.   In just one example, Rizzo says kitchen work was demeaning, while Children's World claims that everyone helped out in the kitchen.   A factfinder will have to determine whether consigning Rizzo to kitchen duty was an adverse action taken because of her disability.   Thus, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Children's World took an adverse employment action against Rizzo, and, again, summary judgment is inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not doubt that Children's World acted in good faith throughout this matter, motivated by what it considered to be concern for the children's safety.   Nonetheless, there is a genuine fact issue regarding whether Rizzo poses a direct threat, making summary judgment inappropriate.   Therefore, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> District Judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We recently made clear that the Title VII burden shifting framework applies in ADA cases.

Rizzo claims that she was removed from her van driving duties at Children's World because of her hearing impairment.   The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Children's World.   Finding that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Rizzo is a qualified individual with a disability, we reverse the district court's summary judgment and remand for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rizzo began working at Children's World as a teacher's aide in March 1991.   She had a hearing impairment that required the use of hearing aids, which she disclosed to Children's World on her job application.   Her duties at Children's World included assisting in the classroom, doing administrative paperwork and driving children in the Children's World van.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1993, a parent complained to Children's World Director Myra Ryan about Rizzo being left alone with children, given her hearing impairment.   The parent also expressed concern over Rizzo's ability to drive the van safely.   Director Ryan discussed the complaint with Rizzo and Rizzo admitted that she had experienced further hearing loss and was scheduled to see her doctor to determine if stronger hearing aids were necessary.   Director Ryan asked Rizzo whether she could hear a child choking in the back of the van.   Rizzo said that she did not know if she could hear a choking child, but she thought that it was safe for her to drive the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rizzo was removed from her driving responsibilities until she could bring a report from her audiologist stating that it was safe for her to drive the van.   On March 11, 1993, Rizzo brought a report from her audiologist which said that she could hear emergency vehicles.   However, the report did not discuss whether Rizzo could hear a child choking at the back of the van.   Children's World told Rizzo that before she could drive the van it needed that information.   Rizzo said that the audiologist would have to observe her at work to make that determination and Children's World said that this was acceptable.   Nevertheless, the audiologist never observed Rizzo and no further report on her ability to hear a choking child was ever sent to Children's World.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Rizzo's removal from her driving duties, she was assigned food preparation duties previously performed by Children's World's cook.   She was asked to work a split shift (early mornings and late afternoons) and her hours were reduced.   Rizzo asserts that as a result of Children's World's actions, she lost respect among her peers and she was shamed by having to prove that it was safe for her to drive the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Children's World contends that the reason Rizzo worked a split schedule and cooked meals was that she requested that she not be placed in a classroom by herself for more than thirty minutes at a time, and that she not be placed with school age children.   Therefore, their actions were a reasonable accommodation for her disability, not discriminatory acts.   Children's World further maintains that Rizzo remained a full-time employee and was not demoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rizzo resigned her position with Children's World on May 20, 1993.   She then filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which issued her a right to sue letter.   Rizzo then filed suit against Children's World in federal district court under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101, et seq., alleging that because of her hearing impairment she was (1) wrongfully demoted, (2) discriminated against, and (3) wrongfully perceived to be a direct threat to the health or safety of herself or others in the work place.   She also alleges that Children's World failed to make reasonable accommodation for her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE DISTRICT COURT OPINION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court applied the McDonnell Douglas Title VII burden shifting paradigm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  McDonnell Douglas v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span> (1981).   Applying the McDonnell Douglas framework, the district court found that Rizzo met her prima facie case of showing that \"she was a disabled person who was 'otherwise qualified' to perform her job duties.\"   The district court found that she was \"otherwise qualified\" because she could, with reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of her position.   The district court found that there was \"a relatively inexpensive device [which] might have been placed in the van to amplify sounds coming from behind the driver,\" thereby accommodating any disability she might have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Rizzo met her prima facie case, the district court shifted the burden to Children's World to show a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to temporarily remove her from driving duties.   The district court found that Children's World met this burden because its statement that it removed Rizzo because she might not hear a choking child was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then placed the burden on Rizzo to come \"forward with a genuine issue of fact as to whether Children's World's accommodations were discriminatory or unreasonable.\"   The district court found that Rizzo did not meet this burden and, thus, held that as a matter of law Children's World did not violate the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Such a showing entitles the movant to summary judgment as a matter of law.   The movant accomplishes this by informing the court of the basis for its motion, and by identifying portions of the record which highlight the absence of genuine factual issues.   Once the movant produces such evidence, the nonmovant must then direct the court's attention to evidence in the record sufficient to establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial--that is, the nonmovant must come forward with evidence establishing each of the challenged elements of its case for which the nonmovant will bear the burden of proof at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nonmovant can satisfy its burden by tendering depositions, affidavits, and other competent evidence to buttress its claim....

Children's World, however, contends that it had a reason to discriminate.

Doe, 50 F.3d at 1264;  Chiari, 920 F.2d at 315.   Children's World put on summary judgment evidence showing that Rizzo is not a qualified individual with a disability, because she could not perform an essential element of the job, namely, driving the bus safely.   Children's World pointed out that Rizzo might not be able to hear a child choking in the back of the van, thus she was a direct threat to the children.   Rizzo countered by bringing forth evidence showing that she possessed all required licenses to be able to drive the bus.   She also presented testimony from her audiologist that she could hear emergency vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is not whether Rizzo could hear a choking child.   There is no evidence that an essential element of the job is the ability to hear a choking child.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Instead, the question is whether the person is able to safely drive the van and not present a direct threat to the children's safety.   The ADA provides that \" 'qualification standards' may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the work place.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12113(b).

Whether one is a direct threat is a complicated, fact intensive determination, not a question of law.   To determine whether a particular individual performing a particular act poses a direct risk to others is a matter for the trier of fact to determine after weighing all of the evidence about the nature of the risk and the potential harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An employee who is a direct threat is not a qualified individual with a disability.   As with all affirmative defenses, the employer bears the burden of proving that the employee is a direct threat.   See Interpretive Guidance to 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.15(b) &amp; (c) (\"With regard to safety requirements that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, an employer must demonstrate that the requirement, as applied to the individual, satisfies the 'direct threat' standard in section 1630.2(r) in order to show that the requirement is job related and consistent with business necessity\") (emphasis added).   Therefore, to prevail on summary judgment on the direct threat issue, Children's World must prove that Rizzo is a direct threat as a matter of law.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></span> (1994).   Both cases involved insulin dependent diabetics who were not allowed to drive city vehicles.   In both cases government rules and regulations specifically prohibited insulin dependent diabetics from driving for the cities.   In fact, the United States Department of Transportation regulations prohibit insulin dependent diabetics from operating large trucks or buses.  49 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 383.5, 383.23, 383.71, and 391.41 (1994);  Daugherty, 56 F.3d at 697.   Because the risk presented by insulin dependent drivers is so great, we have held, \"as a matter of law, [that] a driver with insulin dependent diabetes ... presents a genuine substantial risk that he could injure himself or others.\"  Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1395.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation presented in the instant case is different.   Children's World has pointed us to no statute or regulation regarding hearing-impaired drivers.   Texas has no requirement that its day care workers meet certain minimum hearing requirements.   We do not have voluminous caselaw regarding the dangers presented by hearing impaired drivers.   Cf. Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1395 (citing cases regarding dangers posed by insulin dependent diabetics).   No evidence was presented regarding the ability of anyone to hear a choking child while driving a van.   Children's World only pointed out a lack of evidence on the issue of Rizzo's ability to hear a choking child.   Rizzo countered with evidence showing that it was safe for her to drive the van.   Whether a person who can hear emergency vehicles, but cannot hear a choking child, is a direct threat is a question of fact.   Therefore, there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Rizzo is a direct threat, and thus, whether she was a qualified individual with a disability.   Because there is a genuine issue of material fact, summary judgment is inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding whether Rizzo's hearing impairment presents a direct threat, the factfinder should of course weigh heavily the fact that Rizzo drives a van carrying small children.   That any potential harm will befall children, the most vulnerable members of our society, will greatly impact the consideration of \"[t]he nature and severity of the potential harm.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(r).   We wholeheartedly agree with the district judge's statement that \"the health and safety of the children [is Children's World's] primary consideration.\"   Our opinion should in no way be interpreted as lessening the protection offered to children.   Rather, we are merely saying that, at this time, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Rizzo is a direct threat, making summary judgment inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Adverse Employment Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to proving that she is a qualified individual with a disability, Rizzo must also prove that Children's World took an adverse employment action solely because of her disability.   Children's World argues that it took no adverse employment action at all, but merely worked to accommodate Rizzo's disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, Rizzo argues that Children's World (1) removed her from her driving duties, (2) reduced her hours, (3) forced her to work a split shift, and (4) forced her to work in the kitchen, which she found demeaning.   Children's World maintains that Rizzo remained a full-time employee and her hourly wage was never reduced.   Any loss in hours was due to lowered enrollment, as well as Rizzo's request to leave early in order to get to another job.   The split shift was due to Rizzo's request that she not teach school age children and that she not be alone in a classroom for more than 30 minutes at a time.   The kitchen work, Children's World contends, was not demeaning, because everyone at the center helped with food preparation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA prohibits discrimination in the \"terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112.   This language is broad enough to encompass the actions Rizzo has alleged.  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.5 (\"[I]t is unlawful for a covered entity to limit, segregate, or classify a[n] ... employee in a way that adversely affects his or her employment opportunities or status on the basis of disability.\");   Interpretive Guidance to 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.5 (\"[I]t would be a violation ... for an employer to limit the duties of an employee with a disability based on a presumption ... about the abilities of an individual with such a disability.\").   Lowering someone's hours, requiring them to work a split shift and changing their duties from that of bus driver to cook is certainly a change in the conditions of employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Children's World raises several good points to rebut Rizzo's claims.   However, its arguments merely serve to illustrate that a genuine issue exists which must be resolved by the jury.   In just one example, Rizzo says kitchen work was demeaning, while Children's World claims that everyone helped out in the kitchen.   A factfinder will have to determine whether consigning Rizzo to kitchen duty was an adverse action taken because of her disability.   Thus, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Children's World took an adverse employment action against Rizzo, and, again, summary judgment is inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not doubt that Children's World acted in good faith throughout this matter, motivated by what it considered to be concern for the children's safety.   Nonetheless, there is a genuine fact issue regarding whether Rizzo poses a direct threat, making summary judgment inappropriate.   Therefore, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> District Judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We recently made clear that the Title VII burden shifting framework applies in ADA cases.
