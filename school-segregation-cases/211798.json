(No. CV-87-V-\n1109-N), Robert E. Varner, Judge.\n\nBefore COX, Circuit Judge, KRAVITCH, Senior Circuit Judge, and STAGG*, Senior District Judge.\n\n       KRAVITCH, Senior Circuit Judge:\n\n       The Alabama Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") prohibits inmates who test positive for\n\nthe Human Immunodeficiency Virus (\"HIV\") from participating in most of the educational,\n\nvocational, rehabilitative, religious, and recreational programs offered in state prisons. The\n\nappellant class, which consists of Alabama inmates who are HIV-positive (\"HIV+\" or\n\"seropositive\"), claims that excluding HIV+ prisoners from these programs violates the\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (\"section 504\" or \"the Act\"). A prior panel\n\nof this court, on an appeal by these appellants from a post-trial dismissal of their class action,\n\nremanded the section 504 claim \"for additional findings and clarification by the district court.\"\n\nHarris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1528 (11th Cir.1991). On remand, the district court ruled in favor\n\nof DOC but failed to comply with the panel's mandate. Accordingly, we again vacate the district\n\ncourt's decision and remand.\n\n\n   *\n     Honorable Tom Stagg, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Louisiana,\nsitting by designation.\n\f                                                   I.\n\n          Upon entry into the Alabama prison system, each inmate is tested to determine whether he\n\nor she carries HIV. The state incarcerates men testing positive at the Limestone Correctional Facility\n\n(\"Limestone\") and women testing positive at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women (\"Tutwiler\").\n\nEach of these prisons houses HIV+ inmates in a separate unit. Seropositive prisoners not only live\n\napart from non-infected inmates, but, in addition, \"they have not been able to participate in most of\n\nthe programs available to general population prisoners, while in other cases, the segregated\n\nprogramming provided to them is not comparable.\" Harris, 941 F.2d at 1521-22.1\n\n          Carmen Harris filed suit in 1987 and later became the named plaintiff of the class of\n\nprisoners seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against DOC. The class claimed that Alabama's\n\nHIV policy violated several constitutional provisions and section 504. The district court rejected\n\neach of the class' claims. Harris v. Thigpen, 727 F.Supp. 1564 (M.D.Ala.1990). The prior panel\n\naffirmed the district court's principal constitutional rulings,2 but vacated its statutory ruling. Noting\n\nthe absence of any \"particularized inquiry\" by the district court, the panel established the law of the\n\ncase by remanding for \"full findings of fact and conclusions of law as to each program and activity\n\nfrom which HIV-positive prisoners are being excluded, and a proper weighing of the dangers of\n\ntransmission in each context.\" 941 F.2d at 1527.\n\n          On remand, appellant Onishea was substituted as named plaintiff for Harris, who died during\nthe litigation. The district court held a lengthy trial and, in an opinion discussing each program from\n\nwhich appellants are excluded, ruled that every program satisfied section 504. Onishea v. Herring,\n\nNo. 87-V1109-N, slip op. (M.D.Ala. Dec. 29, 1995) (hereinafter \"Op.\"). Appellants filed a timely\n\nappeal.\n\n   1\n    Specific information regarding the testing and segregation process and the epidemiology of\nHIV infection can be found in Judge Fay's thoughtful and exhaustive opinion in the prior appeal\nof this case. We presume familiarity with that opinion.\n   2\n    The class' constitutional claim concerning access to the courts was remanded for additional\nfactual findings and for clarification of the district court's prior order. Harris, 941 F.2d at 1528.\nThe district court again denied relief on remand, and that issue has not been appealed.\n\n                                                   2\n\f                                                  II.\n\n        Appellants suggest that the district court's opinion contains numerous errors of law and fact\n\nthat call into question the court's ultimate rejection of their section 504 claim. We discuss the\n\nessential statutory elements of a cause of action under the Act and then address the specific\n\nchallenges to the district court's decision.\n\n                                                  A.\n\n        Section 504 states: \"No otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by\n\nreason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\n\nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance....\"\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794. Thus, appellants' prima facie case of unlawful discrimination under the Act\n\nconsists of four elements:\n\n        1) they are \"handicapped\" within the meaning of the Act; 2) they are \"otherwise qualified\";\n        3) they are excluded from programs or activities solely because of the handicap; and 4) the\n        programs or activities from which they are excluded are operated by an agency that receives\n        federal financial assistance.\n\nHarris, 941 F.2d at 1522. Only one of these elements is in dispute in this appeal—whether\n\nappellants are \"otherwise qualified.\" Id. at 1522-24 (holding that being HIV+ is a \"handicap\" and\n\nnoting that latter two requirements were undisputed).\n\n        Deciding whether a person with a contagious disease satisfies the \"otherwise qualified\"\n\nprong of section 504 necessarily begins with Sch. Bd. of Nassau County, Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S.\n273, 107 S.Ct. 1123, 94 L.Ed.2d 307 (1987). In Arline, the Supreme Court explained that a person\n\nis \"otherwise qualified\" if he \"is able to meet all of a program's requirements in spite of his\n\nhandicap.\" Id. at 287 n. 17, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 n. 17 (quoting Southeastern Community College v.\n\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2367, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979)). If the individual has a\n\ncontagious disease, however, the \"otherwise qualified\" element requires \"the district court ... to\n\nconduct an individualized inquiry and make appropriate findings of fact\" to determine whether\n\nintegration would pose \"significant health and safety risks.\" Id. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1131. The\n\nsignificance of the risk turns on\n\n                                                   3\n\f        reasonable medical judgments given the state of medical knowledge[ ] about (a) the nature\n        of the risk (how the disease is transmitted), (b) the duration of the risk (how long is the\n        carrier infectious), (c) the severity of the risk (what is the potential harm to third parties) and\n        (d) the probabilities the disease will be transmitted and will cause varying degrees of harm.\n\nId. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 (internal quotation omitted).3 These factors must be balanced; it is\n\nmore easily justified, for example, for a federal grantee to exclude a person whose terminal illness\n\nis transmitted by casual contact than a person who poses little threat of infecting others or who\n\ncarries a less serious disease.\n\n        Even if a plaintiff is not \"otherwise qualified\" for a program, \"refusal to modify an existing\n\nprogram might become unreasonable and discriminatory\" under the Act. Southeastern Community\n\nCollege v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 413, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2370, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979). That is, even\n\nthough a plaintiff's participation in a federally-funded program poses a significant risk to others, a\n\nplaintiff is nevertheless entitled to relief under the Act if reasonable accommodation will render the\n\nrisk insignificant. Harris, 941 F.2d at 1525. A proposed accommodation, however, need not be\n\nimplemented if it would impose an undue fiscal or administrative burden upon the recipient of\n\nfederal funds or would require the grantee fundamentally to alter its program. Alexander v. Choate,\n\n469 U.S. 287, 299-302, 105 S.Ct. 712, 719-21, 83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985); Arline, 480 U.S. at 287 n.\n\n17, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 n. 17. The reasonable accommodation and undue burden inquiries overlap\n\nsomewhat, and their precise contours are difficult to chart. See Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist.,\n\n63 F.3d 131, 144-48 (2d Cir.1995) (discussing relationship between inquiries). Federal grantees\n\nmust take modest, but not unreasonable, affirmative steps to ensure that disabled persons have\n\n\n   3\n    Subsequent to Arline, Congress amended the Act to clarify that, in the employment context, a\nperson with a contagious disease could be an \"individual with a disability\" unless that person,\n\"by reason of such disease or infection, would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of\nother individuals or who, by reason of the currently contagious disease or infection, is unable to\nperform the duties of the job.\" Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Pub.L. No. 100-259, 102\nStat. 28 (codified at 29 U.S.C. § 706(8)(D)). The intent of this amendment was to codify the\nArline standard. See 134 CONG. REC. S1739 (daily ed. Mar. 2, 1988) (statement of Sen. Harkin)\n(\"[T]he purpose of the amendment was to clarify—and not to modify in any way—the\nprotections of section 504, as they apply to individuals with contagious diseases or infections.\nThe amendment is consistent with the Supreme Court decision in [Arline ].\"); see also EEOC v.\nAmego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 143 (1st Cir.1997).\n\n                                                    4\n\faccess to program benefits. See Davis, 442 U.S. at 407-08, 99 S.Ct. at 2367-68 (holding that grantee\n\nnursing program not required to provide student with personalized faculty assistance in\n\ncommunicating with patients or exemption from certain required courses as reasonable\n\naccommodations); Tatro v. State of Texas, 625 F.2d 557 (5th Cir.1980) (grantee school may be\n\nrequired to perform simple, brief medical procedure for student as a reasonable accommodation).\n\n       Applying these precepts to the facts of the case at bar, appellants are \"otherwise qualified\"\n\nif they are capable of participating in a prison program notwithstanding their disability and if their\n\nparticipation does not pose a significant risk to other inmates. We assess the significance of the risk\n\nby considering the potentially terminal nature of HIV infection, the likelihood that certain behavior\n\nwill result in HIV transmission, and the frequency of such behavior in prison programs. If\n\nappellants are not \"otherwise qualified\" because they present a significant risk, reasonable\n\naccommodations may be available to render such risk insignificant. In prison, such accommodations\n\nwill involve measures designed to prevent high-risk behavior. A prison grantee, however, is not\n\nobliged to undertake those accommodations that prove to be unduly burdensome from an\n\nadministrative or financial standpoint.\n\n                                                  B.\n\n        On remand, the district court found that appellants were not \"otherwise qualified\" for any\n\nof the prison programs from which they have been categorically excluded.4 It also ruled that the\n\naccommodations proposed by appellants either were insufficient to minimize the risk of transmitting\n\nHIV or would pose an unreasonable burden on prison administration. Appellants argue that these\n\nconclusions were erroneous. Specifically, they claim that the district court: (1) allocated the\n\n\n   4\n    Appellants challenge their segregation from numerous programs, including religious\nservices, rehabilitation programs (including drug and alcohol abuse classes), prison visitation,\nvocational classes (ranging from data processing to welding), organized recreational activities,\ndining hall use, medical clinic visits, out-of-the-prison programs, educational programs\n(including GED and college courses), a number of prison jobs (such as data entry, errand\nrunning, kitchen and laundry jobs, maintenance and housekeeping duty, and work in prison\nfactories), and library use. HIV+ prisoners may participate in some of these activities separately;\nother programs are unavailable to seropositive inmates.\n\n                                                  5\n\fburdens of persuasion at trial incorrectly; (2) improperly required appellants to disprove every\n\npossibility of HIV transmission in a program before finding the inmates \"otherwise qualified\"; (3)\n\nwrongly found that a plaintiff is not \"otherwise qualified\" if penological concerns justify\n\ndiscrimination; (4) refused to consider probative evidence that certain programs could be integrated\n\nsafely; (5) misinterpreted the prior panel's opinion by refusing to consider whether certain programs\n\ncould be integrated at all; and (6) mistakenly concluded that any accommodation imposing\n\nadditional costs upon DOC would be an undue financial burden.5\n       Appellants' first argument is unpersuasive, but we conclude that their second and third claims\n\nare meritorious and require us to vacate the district court's decision. We discuss the remaining\n\nclaims because they address errors that would likely occasion a third appeal and remand should they\n\nbe repeated. Claims (1), (2), (3) and (5) are issues of law, which we review de novo, United States\n\nv. Olin Corp., 107 F.3d 1506, 1508 (11th Cir.1997); claim (4) challenges the district court's\n\nexclusion of evidence, which we review for abuse of discretion, Judd v. Rodman, 105 F.3d 1339,\n\n1341 (11th Cir.1997); and claim (6) is an issue of fact, which we review for clear error. Hovsons,\n\nInc. v. Township of Brick, 89 F.3d 1096, 1101 (3d Cir.1996).\n\n   5\n    Appellants also contend that the district court misinterpreted the prior panel's opinion by\nrefusing to consider whether individual members of the appellant class were \"otherwise\nqualified\" or could be made so with reasonable accommodation. They argue that if they can\nshow that one of their number can be integrated safely into a prison program, then the class as a\nwhole is entitled to a declaration that the categorical ban on seropositive inmates' participation in\nthat program violates the Act. This argument is not without appeal, especially in view of section\n504's preference for individualized treatment. See, e.g., Arline, 480 U.S. at 284, 107 S.Ct. at\n1129 (\"The fact that some persons who have contagious diseases may pose a serious health\nthreat to others under certain circumstances does not justify excluding from the coverage of the\nAct all persons with actual or perceived contagious diseases.\"). Moreover, common sense tells\nus that if one class member can establish his or her eligibility for a prison program, then the\ncategorical ban is in tension with section 504's goals. Nevertheless, we conclude that the prior\nopinion in this case precludes an inquiry that focuses on a particular individual's eligibility for\nspecific programs. The panel directed the district court to determine whether appellants were\n\"otherwise qualified\" in light of \"the risk of HIV transmission with regard to each program,\"\n941 F.2d at 1526, and \"to examine as to each program whether \"reasonable accommodations' by\nthe DOC could minimize such a risk to an acceptable level.\" Id. at 1527 (emphasis added).\nBecause the prior panel directed the district court to undertake such an inquiry and because a\nprogram-level assessment of risk in this case is not plainly inconsistent with section 504, see\nArline, 480 U.S. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 (individualized inquiry is necessary \"in most cases,\"\nbut not all), we reject appellants' argument based on the law of the case doctrine.\n\n                                                  6\n\f                                                  1.\n\n        Appellants argue that circuit precedent places the burden on defendants to prove at trial that\n\nplaintiffs are not otherwise qualified or could not be made so with reasonable accommodation, but\n\nthat the district court erroneously placed that burden on appellants. The district court concluded that\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act requires plaintiffs to bear the burden of showing that they are qualified to\n\nparticipate in a program or that an accommodation is available that will make them qualified.\n\nAlthough we do not adopt the district court's reasoning,6 we conclude that it properly allocated the\n\nburdens in the present case.\n\n       In Treadwell v. Alexander, 707 F.2d 473, 475 (11th Cir.1983), we stated that \"[o]nce a\n\nplaintiff shows an employer denied him employment because of physical condition, the burden of\n\npersuasion shifts to the federal employer to show that the criteria used are job related and that [the]\n\nplaintiff could not safely and efficiently perform the essentials of the job.\" We also concluded that\n\na \"federal employer has the ultimate burden of persuasion in showing an inability to accommodate.\"\n\nId. at 478.7 According to appellants, these remarks mean that appellants can carry their trial burden\n\nby demonstrating that they would be able to participate in prison programs if they were not HIV+.\n\nDOC then would have to prove that appellants' seropositivity poses a significant risk that cannot be\n\naccommodated.\n\n       Appellants' contention is inconsistent with both our controlling precedent and the prior\npanel's remand. Recently, we stated unequivocally that a disabled plaintiff must prove that he or she\n\nis \"otherwise qualified\" by showing that he or she is capable of participation in a program, either\n\n   6\n     The district court noted that Treadwell v. Alexander, 707 F.2d 473 (11th Cir.1983), and\nFitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112 (11th Cir.1993), \"appear[ ] to have placed a more\nstringent burden upon defendants in a Rehabilitation Act claim,\" Op. at 20, than did Texas Dep't\nof Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981), in a\nTitle VII case. Consequently, it refused to follow Treadwell and Fitzpatrick, even though it\nthought that they were on point and binding, and even though they came after Burdine. This was\nimproper for obvious reasons.\n   7\n   See also Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d at 1127 n. 17 (dicta) (burden of persuasion on reasonable\naccommodation issue rests with defendant); Prewitt v. United States Postal Serv., 662 F.2d 292,\n308 (5th Cir. Unit A Nov.1981) (same).\n\n                                                  7\n\fwith or without accommodation. Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, Ga., 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th\n\nCir.1997). If accommodation is necessary, \"[t]he plaintiff retains at all times the burden of\n\npersuading the jury that reasonable accommodations were available,\" and if that burden is met, the\n\ndefendant \"has the burden of persuasion on whether an accommodation would impose an undue\n\nhardship.\" Id.; see also Moses v. American Nonwovens, Inc., 97 F.3d 446, 447 (11th Cir.1996)\n\n(same burdens). Likewise, in remanding the instant case, the prior panel held that \"in order to obtain\n\nrelief under section 504 appellants must establish that ... they are \"otherwise qualified'....\" Harris,\n\n941 F.2d at 1522 (emphasis added).\n\n       Treadwell does not command a different result. In that case, this court suggested that a\n\nRehabilitation Act plaintiff need only \"com[e] forward with evidence to make at least a facial\n\nshowing that his handicap can be accommodated\" before the burden of persuasion shifts to the\n\ndefendant. 707 F.2d at 478. The issue the court found dispositive, however, was that the defendant\n\nproffered evidence sufficient to show that the proposed accommodation—reassignment of some of\n\nthe plaintiff's job duties to other workers—would pose an undue burden. Id. Consequently, the panel\n\ndid not have to decide who bore the ultimate burden to show the availability of a reasonable\n\naccommodation.\n\n       Moreover, Treadwell 's dictum is distinguishable; the instant case challenges a federal\n\ngrantee's practice under section 504, whereas Treadwell involved a suit against a federal agency\nunder section 501, 29 U.S.C. § 791(b). Unlike section 504, section 501 requires agencies to\n\nundertake affirmative action in favor of disabled people. See id. According to the Treadwell court,\n\n\"[t]he necessity for providing reasonable accommodation is derived from\" section 501's affirmative\n\naction mandate. 707 F.2d at 477-78. In light of this observation and section 501's purpose, which\n\nis to make the government a model employer, a proof regime different from section 504 is\n\nappropriate. Cf. Overton v. Reilly, 977 F.2d 1190, 1194 (7th Cir.1992) (citing Treadwell and\n\nsuggesting that actions pursuant to sections 501 and 504 are identical, with the possible exception\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fof the burden of persuasion on the issue of reasonable accommodation); Mantolete v. Bolger, 767\n\nF.2d 1416, 1425 (9th Cir.1985) (Rafeedie, J., concurring) (noting differences between sections).\n\n       In sum, we hold that the district court correctly concluded that appellants bear the burden of\n\npersuading the finder of fact that they are \"otherwise qualified\" to participate in prison programs.\n\nThis burden may be satisfied by showing either that their seropositivity poses no significant risk to\n\nothers in the program or that reasonable accommodations are available to reduce the risk to an\n\ninsignificant level. If appellants demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that available\n\naccommodations would make them \"otherwise qualified,\" then DOC would have to prove that the\n\nproposed accommodations pose an undue burden. We realize that \"the evidence probative of the\n\nissue of whether an accommodation ... is reasonable will often be similar (or identical) to the\n\nevidence probative of the issue of whether a resulting hardship ... is undue,\" Willis v. Conopco, 108\n\nF.3d 282, 286 (11th Cir.1997), but note that appellants' burden ordinarily operates at a higher level\n\nof generality. That is, appellants will have to show that the suggested accommodation will diminish\n\nsufficiently the risk of transmission and is reasonable \" \"in the run of cases....' \" Id. at 286 n. 2\n\n(quoting Barth v. Gelb, 2 F.3d 1180, 1187 (D.C.Cir.1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1030, 114 S.Ct.\n\n1538, 128 L.Ed.2d 190 (1994)). DOC would then be required to demonstrate that the proposed\n\naccommodation is unreasonable \"in the context of the particular agency's operations.\" Id.\n\n                                                  2.\n         People with contagious diseases are \"otherwise qualified\" if they meet all of the\n\nprerequisites for program participation and if their participation would not pose a significant danger.\n\nAs stated supra, whether a person poses a significant threat depends on how the infection is\n\ntransmitted, how long carriers are contagious, the potential harm to third parties, and the probability\n\nthat the disease will be transmitted. Arline, 480 U.S. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131. The central issue\n\nbefore the district court on remand concerned the fourth factor—the probability of transmission in\n\nspecific programs. Appellants claim that the district court erroneously applied an unduly exacting\n\nstandard in ruling that they could not be \"otherwise qualified\" for a program if there were any risk\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fof transmission from HIV+ inmates' participation. We agree that the district court demanded proof\n\nbeyond that which the Act requires.\n\n       In Arline, the Supreme Court held that persons with infectious diseases are \"otherwise\n\nqualified\" unless, based upon four factors, their contagion poses \"significant health and safety risks\n\n\" to others, 480 U.S. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1130 (emphasis added). At the same time, however, a\n\nfootnote suggested that one of these factors would have determinative weight in certain cases. The\n\nCourt remarked: \"A person who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to\n\nothers in the workplace will not be otherwise qualified for his or her job if reasonable\n\naccommodation will not eliminate that risk.\" Id. at 287 n. 16, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 n. 16 (emphasis\n\nadded). Thus, the Court seemed to distinguish between significant health risks and significant\n\ntransmission risks and implied that a less than significant risk of transmission, no matter what the\n\ndisease, alone could not suffice to justify a person's exclusion from a federally-funded program.\n\n       The district court resolved the arguable tension between Arline 's significant health risk\n\nstandard and its significant transmission risk footnote by declaring the latter to be a misstatement.\n\nIt opined that \"[a] strict reading of this could suggest that in analyzing whether reasonable\n\naccommodations would render one \"otherwise qualified,' the trial court should ignore the remaining\n\nArline factors ... and consider only the probability of transmission.\" Op. at 47. The district court\n\nthen asked: \"May this Court not weigh the catastrophic nature, duration, and severity against a\nlightweight probability of transmission?\" Id. In the end, the district court concluded that a small\n\npossibility of transmission—but more than a remote theoretical possibility—would suffice to justify\n\nexclusion of HIV+ persons from programs receiving federal funds.\n\n       This circuit's law is to the contrary. In Martinez v. School Bd. of Hillsborough County, Fla.,\n\n861 F.2d 1502 (11th Cir.1988), we held that the district court erred in upholding the exclusion of\n\nan HIV+ child from special education classes. The school board argued that the child might transmit\n\nHIV to her classmates and teachers through saliva, tears, and excrement. The district court found\n\nthat a \"remote theoretical possibility\" of transmission existed in an integrated program and ordered\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fthe student segregated. Id. at 1506. We rejected the district court's analysis because it required too\n\nrigorous a showing; the likelihood of transmission did not \"rise to the \"significant' risk level that\n\nis required\" under section 504. Id. In announcing this standard, we cited the Arline footnote that the\n\ndistrict court in the present case declared irrelevant, and we remanded for \"findings as to the overall\n\nrisk of transmission. ...\" Id. (emphasis added).\n\n       The district court in this case distinguished Martinez, which involved transmission through\n\nmeans that were only theoretically possible (e.g., saliva and tears), from this case, which involves\n\nestablished transmission pathways (e.g., sex and needle sharing). Although correct, this observation\n\ndoes not vitiate Martinez 's announcement of a significant transmission risk test in cases involving\n\nHIV. Moreover, it ignores the fact that the prior panel hearing this case, citing both Martinez and\n\nthe Arline footnote, endorsed the significant risk of transmission standard for this specific set of\n\nfacts,. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1525 (\"If, after reasonable accommodations, a significant risk of\n\ntransmission of the infectious disease still exists, a plaintiff will not be considered \"otherwise\n\nqualified' ....\") (emphasis added).\n\n       The district court bolstered its decision to deviate from the significant risk standard by\n\nreferring to non-circuit precedent, but gave the mistaken impression that courts have uniformly\n\neschewed the significant transmission risk test in HIV cases. We are aware that the Fourth and Fifth\n\nCircuits have declared that HIV+ medical workers who pose a less than significant risk of\ntransmitting HIV may, consistent with section 504, be prohibited from performing invasive\n\nprocedures. See Doe v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1266 (4th Cir.1995) (\"Although\n\nthere may presently be no documented case of surgeon-to-patient transmission, such transmission\n\nclearly is possible.\"); Leckelt v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 909 F.2d 820, 829 (5th Cir.1990) (\"Even though\n\nthe probability that a health care worker will transmit HIV to a patient may be extremely low and\n\ncan be further minimized through the use of universal precautions, there is no cure for HIV or AIDS\n\nat this time, and the potential harm of HIV infection is extremely high.\"). Other courts, however,\n\nhave followed closely the Supreme Court's direction in Arline. See Chalk v. United States Dist.\n\n\n                                                   11\n\fCourt, 840 F.2d 701, 707-08 (9th Cir.1988) (\"As authoritatively construed by the Supreme Court,\n\nsection 504 allows the exclusion of an employee only if there is \"a significant risk of communicating\n\nan infectious disease to others.' \" (quoting Arline, 480 U.S. at 287 n. 16, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 n. 16));\n\nNew York State Ass'n for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 612 F.2d 644, 650 (2d Cir.1979)\n\n(applying significant transmission risk standard to hepatitis B, which has identical transmission\n\npathways as HIV, is easier to transmit, but is rarely fatal); Doe v. Dolton Elementary Sch. Dist. No.\n\n148, 694 F.Supp. 440, 445-46 (N.D.Ill.1988) (holding that student was likely to prevail and was\n\nentitled to injunction where medical evidence showed no significant risk of HIV transmission in\n\nschool).\n\n        Putting previous interpretations of Arline's footnote aside, we are convinced that the Arline\n\nbalancing test itself would require a significant risk of HIV transmission before sanctioning\n\nsegregation. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that transmission of HIV requires intimate, rather\n\nthan casual, human contact that involves the exchange of certain bodily fluids. Harris, 941 F.2d at\n\n1503. At the same time, the record evidence in this case shows that HIV infection is incurable and\n\npotentially fatal.8 Id. at 1502-03. Because the Arline factors point in different directions, then,\n\ndetermining the overall significance of the risk to third parties depends in large part on assessing the\n\nlikelihood of behavior that would allow transmission of HIV. We realize that HIV infection frightens\n\nmost people because of its life-threatening nature. By enacting section 504, however, Congress has\ndirected its grantees to accept some risks and has prohibited them from unduly indulging their fears.\n\nSee Abbott v. Bragdon, 107 F.3d 934, 946-48 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[A] service provider like Dr. Bragdon\n\nis not entitled to demand absolute safety; he can rely upon the direct threat defense only in response\n\nto significant risks.\").\n\n\n   8\n    It was uncontested at trial that the normal progression of HIV infection leads to an\nAIDS-related death. By the time that the facts of this case are considered anew, that fact may\nhave changed. On remand, we leave it to the district court's discretion how best to discharge its\nresponsibility to assess the dangers of HIV infection \"based on reasonable medical judgments\ngiven the state of medical knowledge. ...\" Arline, 480 U.S. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 (internal\nquotation omitted) (emphasis added).\n\n                                                  12\n\f        We therefore conclude that the district court erred in holding that a less than significant risk\n\nof transmitting HIV justifies appellants' segregation from all programs. Further, a review of the\n\ncourt's decision reveals that this legal conclusion permeated its program-specific findings.\n\nThroughout its opinion, the court ruled that appellants were not \"otherwise qualified\" without any\n\nattempt to quantify whether a sufficient risk of transmission existed to warrant categorical\n\nexclusion.9 Because of the number of programs and activities at issue in this appeal, we will not\n\nenumerate here each instance in which the district court based its ruling on a less than significant\n\nrisk of transmission. We offer, instead, three examples that demonstrate the court's failure to\n\nquantify and appropriately balance the risks in each prison program.\n\n        The district court's consideration of the first program is typical of its approach to many of\n\nthe challenged activities. Religious programs are held in the Tutwiler chapel, with inmates\n\nsupervised at all times by the chaplain or his assistants. Appellants argued at trial that the constant\n\nsupervision would prevent any unsafe behavior, as evidenced by the fact that there had been no\n\nincident reports of risky activity during chapel services. Further, they claimed that any remaining\n\nsafety risk could be rendered insignificant by requiring HIV+ inmates to sit apart from general\n\npopulation prisoners. The court concluded that appellants' evidence failed to prove them \"otherwise\n\nqualified\" because the lack of incident reports \"does not prove that potentially high risk behavior\n\n(e.g., passing needles or syringes) never occurred, only that it has not been discovered.\" Op. at 62.10\n\nIn addition, the district court opined that appellants' suggested accommodations did not aid their\n\ncase; the separate sitting arrangements do not guarantee that high-risk behavior will not occur, the\n\n\n   9\n    We are aware that the district court occasionally used the correct legal terminology, but we\nattach no importance to its choice of words because it is apparent that the court would find a\n\"significant\" risk even where it conceded none existed. Compare Op. at 155 (\"this Court holds\nthat integrating the out-of-the-prison programs would present a significant risk of transmitting\nthe deadly HIV virus\"), with id. at 152 (\"The probability that the HIV disease will be transmitted\nis not significant in the [out-of-the-prison] programs where inmates are supervised by\ncorrectional officers....\").\n   10\n   The court repeated this reasoning in its analysis of 27 of 79 programs it considered at\nLimestone and Tutwiler.\n\n                                                  13\n\fdistrict court reasoned, because the civilian supervisors have no authority to discipline prisoners if\n\nthey do not remain separate. Id. at 68.11 These observations, however, rested on conjecture. First,\n\nthe court assumed that inmates in the programs would possess needles or syringes. Second, it\n\nassumed that exchanges of such contraband occur but previously have been undetected. Third, it\n\nassumed that inmates would not obey the dictates of their civilian supervisors, even though civilian\n\npersonnel are instructed to report disciplinary incidents to prison officials. Notably absent was any\n\nattempt to determine whether or how often inmates have secreted contraband into prison programs,\n\nwhether or how often such contraband is able to be exchanged, and whether or how often such\n\nexchanges lead to high-risk activity. The district court created a scenario for transmission sufficient\n\nto satisfy an \"any risk\" standard by stringing its assumptions together, but failed to show that the\n\nscenario satisfies the governing significant transmission risk test.\n\n          Similarly, the district court held that DOC's exclusion of HIV+ inmates from maintenance\n\njobs at Tutwiler was justified. Although the prisoners are not supervised constantly, appellants\n\nargued that the prison job board only allows those inmates with appropriate behavioral histories to\n\nparticipate, thus minimizing the risk of high-risk behavior and, consequently, transmission. The\n\ndistrict court held that appellants are not \"otherwise qualified\" because \"[t]he risk of the job board's\n\nmaking an erroneous decision always exists,\" Op. at 211,12 and because even careful selection of\n\ninmates who do not misbehave would not prevent potentially HIV-transmitting fights between\nseropositive participants and others who oppose integration. Id. at 217.13 Again, the result reached\nby the court reveals the difference between an \"any risk\" standard and a \"significant risk\" standard.\n\nThe court merely speculated about the job board's fallibility without discussing the potential\n\n\n\n   11\n        This rationale appeared 23 times in the opinion.\n   12\n        The court discussed and dismissed the job board on twelve separate occasions in its opinion.\n\n   13\n     The court justified segregation based on the possibility of HIV transmission from fighting in\nsixteen different programs.\n\n                                                   14\n\ffrequency of such errors14 and assumed that inmate violence was likely to occur in the program.\n\nMoreover, although the district court conceded earlier in its opinion that the transmission risk from\n\nviolence is low, it nevertheless found appellants ineligible to participate. The district court's\n\ncombination of these factors may identify a conceivable pathway for transmission, but it does not\n\namount to the quantitative analysis necessary to find a significant risk.\n\n          The district court's willingness to hypothesize is best exemplified by its treatment of certain\n\nout-of-the-prison programs.15 Although inmates are supervised by corrections officers during such\n\nprograms and although the court conceded that \"[t]he probability that the HIV disease will be\n\ntransmitted is not significant\" in supervised programs, Op. at 152, the court nevertheless rejected\n\nappellants' claims that they were \"otherwise qualified.\" The court reasoned:\n\n          [I]n the prison system, one must always be prepared for the unexpected. An automobile or\n          other accident may incapacitate a guard and leave the inmates on the out-of-the-prison detail\n          free to proceed without an escort. An inmate, temporarily healthy but facing the bleak future\n          of all sero-positives, may have controlling impulses vastly different from those of healthy\n          inmates who may be more concerned about the penal aspects of their future.\n\n          ....\n\n          If ... a correctional officer has been incapacitated in an accident, a female inmate with\n          contempt for that officer could purposely implant, while the guard remains unconscious,\n          blood containing HIV organisms from the HIV+ inmate[']s open wounds.\n\nOp. at 153.16 Thus, the court found segregation justified even though the likelihood of transmission\n\nin these programs depends, in this rather fanciful hypothetical situation, upon the unlikely\ncoincidence of possibilities that an accident might occur, a guard might be wounded and rendered\n\nunconscious, and an HIV+ inmate might have both an open wound and a vendetta. It is exactly this\n\n\n\n\n   14\n    The court's speculation is especially inappropriate after it excluded evidence of the job\nboard's effectiveness. See infra section II.B.4.\n   15\n     Such programs include, for example, the Medium Custody Road Squad, in which inmates\nare supervised while cutting grass and picking up trash alongside roadways by an armed guard.\n   16\n        The court used this identical reasoning to reject integration in 6 separate programs.\n\n                                                    15\n\fkind of speculation that the significant transmission risk test guards against and that section 504\n\nprohibits.17\n\n        These examples are by no means exhaustive and should not be read to suggest that proper\n\napplication of the appropriate standard will necessitate seropositive inmates' participation in all (or\n\neven the preceding) programs. To the contrary, the court may find, upon appropriately quantifying\n\nthe risk inherent in certain activities, that integration is inappropriate. Appellants candidly admit,\n\nfor instance, that HIV+ prisoners might properly be excluded from \"runner jobs,\" in which inmates\n\nperform errands for DOC personnel and have tremendous access to various parts of the prison, often\n\nwithout supervision. Appellants' Reply Br. at 12. We only hold that the district court erroneously\n\nrequired appellants to disprove all conceivable (and even fanciful) risks of transmission, and that\n\nthis ruling requires remand for application of the proper standard.\n\n                                                  3.\n\n        Our conclusion that the district court imposed too strict a burden on appellants does not end\n\nthis case. Instead, we must address the court's alternative ruling that prisoners invoking section 504\n\nmust clear a hurdle that non-inmate plaintiffs need not. Specifically, the court held that inmates'\n\nstatutory rights under the Act may be subordinated to correctional concerns, just as some of their\n\nconstitutional rights may be.18 Under Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 2261, 96\n\n   17\n    Indeed, we submit that the district court's guesswork in these programs would fail even its\nown test, which prohibits segregation based on a theoretical risk of transmission.\n   18\n      The dissent, although conceding that the Act applies to state prisons as the law of the case,\nsuggests that \"the issue may merit en banc attention.\" Because the law of the case doctrine\nprecludes us from redeciding this issue, we cannot quarrel here with the Fourth Circuit's recent\ndecision in Amos v. Md. Dep't of Pub. Safety & Correctional Servs., --- F.3d ---- (4th Cir.1997),\nthat the Act does not apply to state prisons. We note, however, that DOC has conceded in this\nlitigation that section 504 is a remedy available to state prisoners. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1522.\nMoreover, other circuits have squarely confronted the issue and held that state prisoners are\nentitled to protection under the Act. See Yeskey v. Comm. of Pa. Dep't of Corrections, 118 F.3d\n168, 174 (3d Cir.1997); Crawford v. Ind. Dep't of Corrections, 115 F.3d 481, 487 (7th\nCir.1997); Bonner v. Lewis, 857 F.2d 559, 562 (9th Cir.1988). The only other circuit to hold\nthat the Act does not apply to state prisoners did so in a cursory manner. In Williams v. Meese,\n926 F.2d 994, 997 (10th Cir.1991), the court held that a federal prisoner was not entitled to\nprotection under section 504 because the \"Federal Bureau of Prisons does not fit the definition of\n\"programs or activities' governed by that section.\" In White v. Colorado, 82 F.3d 364, 367 (10th\n\n                                                  16\n\fL.Ed.2d 64 (1987), \"when a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the\n\nregulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\"19 The district court\n\nheld that appellants were not \"otherwise qualified\" unless they could prove both that they were\n\ncapable of participating safely in the program (\"the Arline test,\" supra ) and that their participation\n\nwould not cause disciplinary problems (\"the Turner test\"). Because the district court found that\n\nthere was a likelihood of violence whenever HIV+ inmates are mixed with general population\n\nprisoners, it concluded that the Turner test rendered appellants not \"otherwise qualified.\"20 This\n\nholding is erroneous.\n\n          The district court's freedom to determine the applicable \"otherwise qualified\" standard was\n\nconstrained by the prior panel's remand. In setting out what appellants had to prove on remand, the\n\nprior panel discussed only the Arline test. Harris, 941 F.2d at 1525-27. Such silence is significant\n\nbecause the court was acutely aware of the Turner test. Immediately prior to discussing section 504,\n\nthe panel rejected appellants' constitutional right to privacy claim under Turner. Id. at 1512-21.\n\nCrucially, appellants' privacy claim attacked the same condition as their Rehabilitation Act\n\nclaim—their segregation. If both causes of action were subject to Turner, then, the court should\n\nhave rejected both upon determining that either failed the Turner test. Because the prior panel did\n\n\nCir.1996), the court cited Williams, without significant discussion, for the categorical proposition\nthat the Act \"does not apply to issues of prison employment.\"\n   19\n        Under Turner, several factors bear on a regulation's validity:\n\n                  (a) whether there is a \"valid, rational connection\" between the regulation and a\n                  legitimate government interest put forward to justify it; (b) whether there are\n                  alternative means of exercising the asserted constitutional right that remain open\n                  to the inmates; (c) whether and the extent to which accommodation of the\n                  asserted right will have an impact on prison staff, inmates and the allocation of\n                  prison resources generally; and (d) whether the regulation represents an\n                  \"exaggerated response\" to prison concerns.\n\n          Harris, 941 F.2d at 1516.\n   20\n     Turner was the sole ground on which the district court rejected appellants' participation in\ncertain programs. See, e.g., Op. at 369-76 (Limestone staff barber jobs). Usually, however, the\ncourt cited Turner as a justification for segregating HIV+ inmates after having found that they\ncould not satisfy Arline.\n\n                                                   17\n\fnot, we conclude that it ruled that the Arline test, unadorned by Turner, was applicable. On remand,\n\nthat standard was the law of the case.21\n\n        As the law of the case, the prior holding bound the district court \"unless the presentation of\n\nnew evidence or an intervening change in the controlling law dictate[d] a different result, or the\n\nappellate decision [was] clearly erroneous and, if implemented, would work a manifest injustice.\"\n\nLitman v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 825 F.2d 1506, 1510 (11th Cir.1987) (en banc), cert. denied, 484\n\nU.S. 1006, 108 S.Ct. 700, 98 L.Ed.2d 652 (1988). Neither circumstance is present in the instant\n\ncase. Since this court's prior opinion, neither this circuit nor the Supreme Court has suggested, much\n\nless held, that the Turner test applies to inmates' claims under the Rehabilitation Act.\n\n        The panel's refusal in Harris to superimpose Turner upon section 504 also was not clearly\n\nerroneous. Although we are aware that two of our sister circuits have stated that Rehabilitation Act\n\nclaims ought to be subject to the Turner test, Torcasio v. Murray, 57 F.3d 1340, 1355-56 (4th\n\nCir.1995) (dicta), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 772, 133 L.Ed.2d 724 (1996); Gates v.\n\nRowland, 39 F.3d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir.1994),22 there are several reasons why the Harris panel's\n\napproach makes better sense. First, although Turner serves to restrain the judiciary from interfering\n\n\n\n\n   21\n     The district court suggested that this court's prior opinion inserted the Turner test sub\nsilentio, citing two occasions where the court referred to the interests of prison officials. See\nHarris, 941 F.2d at 1522 n. 41 (noting the \"congruence of the Act's goals with those of prison\nofficials\"); id. at 1527 (noting that the Act balances rights of disabled inmates against \"the\nlegitimate concerns of the prison-grantee\"). Neither of these statements suggests that the Turner\ntest applies, nor are they inconsistent with applying section 504's test alone; consideration of\nprison needs is appropriate within the statutory framework because the Act's reasonable\naccommodation and undue burden inquiries are always contextual. In Crawford v. Ind. Dep't of\nCorrections, 115 F.3d 481, 487 (7th Cir.1997), for example, the court cited Turner and noted\nthat \"[t]erms like \"reasonable' and \"undue' are relative to circumstances, and the circumstances of\na prison are different from those of a school, an office, or a factory, as the Supreme Court has\nemphasized in the parallel setting of prisoners' constitutional rights.\" The court did not,\nhowever, hold that Turner might render lawful an otherwise clear case of disability\ndiscrimination.\n   22\n    The Third Circuit has \"flagged\" this issue, but has not yet determined whether Turner\napplies to claims under section 504 or the ADA. Yeskey v. Commonwealth of Pa. Dep't of\nCorrections, 118 F.3d 168, 175 (3d Cir.1997).\n\n                                                 18\n\fin prison matters, a job best left to the legislative and administrative branches,23 482 U.S. at 84-85,\n\n107 S.Ct at 2259, rights under the Rehabilitation Act emanate from those branches, and thus ought\n\nnot be subject to Turner 's requirements without a congressional indication to that effect. Cf. Arline\n\nv. Sch. Bd. of Nassau County, 772 F.2d 759, 762 n. 8 (11th Cir.1985) (\"We would be acting beyond\n\nour authority to read into section 504 limitations which Congress chose not to establish when it\n\nclearly could have done so.\"), aff'd, 480 U.S. 273, 107 S.Ct. 1123, 94 L.Ed.2d 307 (1987). Second,\n\nthe Turner test is in some ways duplicative of the inquiry under the Act. Applied in the prison\n\nsetting, section 504's reasonable accommodation and undue burden inquiries, like Turner's inquiry,\n\nconsider the practicalities of accommodating individual rights within established programs and do\n\nnot require integration where it would pose serious problems that cannot be eliminated consistent\n\nwith effective and efficient prison administration. The Act thus mandates judicial consideration of\n\ninterests particular to the prison system. Finally, it has not been this court's practice to subject\n\nprisoners' statutory claims to the Turner test. See, e.g., Gambetta v. Prison Rehabilitative Indus.\n\n& Diversified Enters., Inc., 112 F.3d 1119, 1123 n. 4 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that prisoners not\n\ncategorically excluded from protection of Fair Labor Standards Act; rejecting blanket exemption\n\nfrom statute where program in question serves rehabilitative purpose); Lawson v. Singletary, 85\n\nF.3d 502, 508-11 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that prisoners covered by Religious Freedom Restoration\n\nAct to extent intended by Congress).24\n\n   23\n     Of course, Turner also serves federalism concerns by keeping federal authority out of state\nprison management unless it is clear that Congress intended such an intrusion. See Torcasio, 57\nF.3d at 1345. This reasoning, however, does not justify subjecting the Rehabilitation Act to\nTurner 's limits because we already have decided that the Rehabilitation Act applies to state\nprisons. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1522 n. 41; supra note 18. The dissent takes us to task for\n\"second-guessing the legitimate penological decisions of state authorities.\" Because such review\nof DOC's decisions has been legislatively mandated (or, to use the dissent's more innocuous\nphrase, \"statutorily prompted\") by section 504, however, our inquiry here does not \"run[ ]\nsquarely counter to the most basic notions of comity,\" but rather fulfills the role Congress has\ncreated for the courts.\n   24\n     The court in Lawson actually subjected the inmates' claim to the Turner test, but only\nbecause it determined that Congress so intended. The opinion clearly indicates, however, that\nCongress' intent, and not the simple fact of incarceration, determines the scope of inmates'\nstatutory rights.\n\n                                                  19\n\f       Thus, the district court erred by grafting Turner's constitutional standard onto this court's\n\nstated statutory test. We therefore hold that the district court's judgment cannot be affirmed based\n\nupon its alternative Turner rationale.\n\n                                                  4.\n\n        Appellants next assert that the district court prohibited them from proving that a reasonable\n\naccommodation exists that would make them \"otherwise qualified.\" Specifically, they object to the\n\ncourt's exclusion of evidence of DOC's ability to conduct, as a precondition to program participation,\n\nan individualized assessment of seropositive inmates' propensities to engage in high-risk activities.\n\nWe conclude that the district court erred.\n\n       On several occasions during trial, appellants sought to introduce evidence about the prison\n\nclassification process, but the district court prohibited them from doing so. For instance, appellants\n\nattempted to elicit testimony explaining Limestone's and Tutwiler's \"job boards\" and \"classification\n\nteams,\" which together gather psychological, penological, and behavioral data about all inmates and\n\nconsider such information in making program recommendations and assignments. The district court\n\nruled that, because this case was remanded for a program-by-program assessment of risk, see supra\n\nnote 5, it was precluded from considering evidence about DOC's ability to make, within programs,\n\ninmate-by-inmate determinations of eligibility. The district court therefore assumed that DOC's\n\ncapacity to select inmates who do not pose a significant risk of transmitting HIV was not relevant\nto the case on remand.\n\n       To the contrary, appellants' proffered evidence was central to the question before the district\n\ncourt. One of the things that appellants were required to prove on remand was that, if they could\n\nnot participate in prison programs safely under current conditions, there existed reasonable\n\naccommodations that would allow seropositive prisoners to be integrated safely. A mechanism\n\nwhereby those least likely to engage in high-risk behavior would be selected for a program may be\n\nan accommodation that could reduce the risk of transmission to an insignificant level in a particular\n\nprogram. Further, appellants offered to prove that such accommodation was reasonably affordable\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fand administratively feasible, also relevant to the court's reasonable accommodation determination,\n\nas DOC already classifies prisoners and recommends them for various programs based upon their\n\nindividual histories. Thus, the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence pertinent\n\nto a fundamental issue in the case.25\n\n        We do not lightly upset a district court's order based upon evidentiary error. Rather, \"[w]e\n\noverturn evidentiary rulings only when the moving party has proved a substantial prejudicial effect.\"\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 61; Judd v. Rodman, 105 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.1997). Here, however, we already\n\nhave decided that remand is necessary.         Further, by negating one of appellants' principal\n\narguments—namely, that they could be accommodated reasonably—the district court's error itself\n\nnecessitates remand because it calls into question the propriety of the court's judgment on the merits\n\nwith respect to each program for which appellants suggested individualized assessment as a\n\nreasonable accommodation. \"Since the district judge's ruling precluded [the plaintiff] from\n\nestablishing a prima facie claim, it cannot be characterized as harmless error.\" Allstate Ins. Co. v.\n\nSwann, 27 F.3d 1539, 1544 (11th Cir.1994).\n\n                                                  5.\n\n         The prior panel's remand demanded an inquiry into each prison program from which\n\nappellants had been excluded. The district court, however, instructed the parties that it would not\n\nentertain argument about several programs that are not held on site at Limestone or Tutwiler but that\n\nare available to general population inmates from both facilities. Specifically, the court refused to\n\nconsider appellants' potential integration into work release programs, correctional industries,\n\nresidential substance abuse programs, a sex offender treatment program, and boot camps.26\n\n   25\n     The district court impliedly recognized this error in its opinion by attempting to evaluate\nindividual assessment as a reasonable accommodation. The court then rejected such\naccommodation based upon the fallibility of the selection process. Its ruling, however, is tainted\nby the fact that it excluded evidence tending to shed light on the ability of DOC to predict\nhigh-risk behavior reliably.\n   26\n    The district court also ruled that it would not consider integrating HIV+ prisoners into\ngeneral population housing. Appellants objected to that decision, but did not raise it on appeal.\nWe deem the issue abandoned. See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, 881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n.\n\n                                                 21\n\fAppellants contend that these programs fall within the scope of the remand and that it was therefore\n\nerror to prevent them from proving that they could participate safely.\n\n        Appellants' argument is well taken. The prior panel's remand was not so limited; it directed\n\nthe court to consider \"each program and activity from which HIV-positive prisoners are being\n\nexcluded....\" Harris, 941 F.2d at 1527. Indeed, the panel even mentioned work release as a program\n\nin which appellants have been denied participation. Id. at 1522 n. 40. In view of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct's expansive definition of \"program or activity,\" see 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1)(A) (holding that\n\n\"program or activity\" includes \"all of the operations\" of state agencies and departments receiving\n\nfederal funds), we agree with appellants that the off-site programs appear to have been a proper\n\nsubject for retrial.27 DOC responds that the prior panel ruled that segregated housing did not violate\n\nseropositive inmates' right to privacy and, because these off-site programs are residential in nature,\n\nimpliedly held that such activities fall outside of section 504. This argument proves too much; by\n\nfinding DOC's practices constitutional, this court did not conclude that they comported with section\n\n504. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for a remand to assess whether program\n\nsegregation violated the statute.28\n\n\n6 (1989).\n   27\n     See also 28 C.F.R. § 42.540 (\"program\" includes the operations of department of\ncorrections); Nondiscrimination Based on Handicap in Federally Assisted Programs, 45\nFed.Reg. 37,620, 37,630 (1980) (listing corrections agencies obligated to make, including\nstructural modifications to accommodate disabled persons, \"jails, prisons, reformatories and\ntraining schools, work camps, reception and diagnostic centers, pre-release and work-release\nfacilities, and community-based facilities\").\n   28\n     In rejecting appellants' argument, the district court also relied in part on the fact that, under\nMeachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 224-25, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 2538-39, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976),\ninmates have no constitutional right to be housed at a specific facility. We have no quarrel with\nthe court's statement, as far as it goes. It is true that, absent some state law entitlement to be\nhoused in a particular place, an inmate does not have an interest protected by procedural due\nprocess in avoiding transfer. See id.; Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U.S. 236, 242, 96 S.Ct. 2543,\n2547, 49 L.Ed.2d 466 (1976). To say this, however, does not absolve prison officials of their\nresponsibility to comply with other substantive guarantees of federal law; just as an equal\nprotection challenge would be proper if prison authorities chose to incarcerate blacks and whites\nin separate prisons, see Lee v. Washington, 390 U.S. 333, 88 S.Ct. 994, 19 L.Ed.2d 1212 (1968),\nso, too, is a Rehabilitation Act challenge appropriate where prison authorities choose separate\nfacilities for the disabled.\n\n                                                  22\n\f       Our conclusion does not command that these programs be integrated. We express no opinion\n\non that subject, especially given the emptiness of the record regarding such activities. We hold only\n\nthat the district court must consider whether section 504 mandates integration.\n\n                                                  6.\n\n        The parties and the district court agree that certain programs could be integrated safely by\n\nadding corrections personnel, in some cases a single officer. The district court, however, rejected\n\nappellants' argument that DOC should add staff as an accommodation. Because DOC does not\n\nreceive from the Alabama legislature all of the funds it requests and because its funding had, at the\n\ntime of trial, recently been reduced, the district court found that the addition of even a single\n\ncorrections officer to integrate HIV+ inmates into certain programs would impose an undue burden\n\nupon DOC. This determination was clearly erroneous.\n\n       Appellants carried their burden of showing that hiring an additional officer is financially\n\nreasonable \" \"in the run of cases,' \" Willis v. Conopco, 108 F.3d 282, 286 n. 2. (11th Cir.1997)\n\n(quoting Barth v. Gelb, 2 F.3d 1180, 1187 (D.C.Cir.1993)), by demonstrating that a new officer\n\nwould not occupy an unreasonably large portion of DOC's budget. It is uncontested that DOC's\n\noperating budget was $178 million in 1993 and $163 million in 1994. It is also uncontested that the\n\nfirst-year cost of an additional corrections officer is $24,483. Appellants satisfied their burden by\n\nciting these stipulated figures. See United States v. Bd. of Trustees for the Univ. of Ala., 908 F.2d\n740, 751 (11th Cir.1990) (\"In light of UAB's annual transportation budget of $1.2 million, an\n\nexpenditure of $15,000, plus occasional amounts ..., is not likely to cause an undue burden on\n\nUAB.\") (citations omitted).\n\n       Consequently, to be permitted to segregate HIV+ inmates from a program where a single\n\nofficer would provide adequate safety, it is DOC's duty to demonstrate that hiring one new officer\n\nis unreasonable \" \"in the context of the particular agency's operations.' \" Willis, 108 F.3d at 286 n.\n\n2. This DOC has not done. That DOC receives fewer funds than it requests or that it has fewer\n\nofficers than it would like says nothing about its ability to hire a single officer within its current\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fbudget. Trial evidence indicated that DOC has tremendous spending discretion within its budget\n\nand can request necessary additional funds from the legislature. Additionally, a defense witness\n\nconceded that DOC would save money if it were to discontinue some of the \"separate but equal\"\n\nprograms currently operated for seropositive prisoners. Such funds presumably could finance an\n\nadditional guard to facilitate integration.\n\n        We therefore conclude that, based upon the evidence before it, the district court clearly erred\n\nin finding that any expenditure by DOC to hire additional staff would be an \"undue burden.\" We\n\nleave open on remand the possibility that sufficient evidence may be adduced as to the\n\nunreasonableness of adding even a single guard, but note that DOC must show that such an\n\naccommodation would be unreasonable given the demands of its present budget. See 28 C.F.R. §\n\n42.511(c) (stating that undue hardship inquiry should consider \"(1) [t]he overall size of the\n\nrecipient's program with respect to number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of\n\nbudget; (2)[t]he type of the recipient's operation, including the composition and structure of the\n\nrecipient's workforce; and (3)[t]he nature and cost of the accommodation needed\").29\n\n                                                  C.\n\n        To summarize, we hold that the district court correctly allocated the burdens of persuasion\n\nat trial. We vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings, however,\n\nbecause the district court determined that appellants were not \"otherwise qualified\" based upon two\nerrors of law: (1) the court required appellants to disprove all conceivable risks of transmission in\n\nprison programs, even though the statute requires only the elimination of significant risks; and (2)\n\nthe court disqualified appellants from programs in which penological interests, such as eliminating\n\ncompletely the potential for inmate violence, purportedly justified segregation. On remand, the\n\ndistrict court must reassess whether appellants are \"otherwise qualified\" in light of our decision.\n\nMoreover, the court should consider evidence that demonstrates DOC's ability to integrate programs\n\n   29\n    Although this provision is located in a section of the Department of Justice's Rehabilitation\nAct regulations titled \"Employment\", the first and third factors it suggests are equally relevant to\nevaluating whether an accommodation would be an undue burden in a non-employment case.\n\n                                                  24\n\fby selecting only those individuals unlikely to engage in high-risk behavior. The court also must\n\nexamine the possibility of integrating the off-site programs discussed in section II.B.5. Finally, the\n\ncourt should not find that DOC has satisfied its burden of proving that suggested accommodations\n\nare unreasonable simply upon a showing that DOC receives less than its requested level of funding\n\nfrom the state or upon a showing that DOC has fewer officers than it would like.30\n\n                                                 III.\n\n        Near the beginning of trial on remand, appellants moved to recuse Judge Varner from\n\nhearing the case. They appeal the district court's denial of that motion, claiming that recusal was\n\nrequired because the son of DOC's lead counsel is Judge Varner's law clerk and because Judge\n\nVarner revealed that he discussed the case with his son, a doctor, who expressed his view that there\n\nwas a risk of HIV transmission in some of the programs at issue on retrial. We review the judge's\n\nrecusal ruling for an abuse of discretion. Loranger v. Stierheim, 10 F.3d 776 (11th Cir.1994). On\n\nappeal, appellants forward an additional ground for disqualification; they claim that the judge's trial\n\ncomments evinced a pervasive hostility toward the members of the appellant class. We are\n\nconcerned by the allegation that the judge and his son discussed disputed matters, but avoid deciding\n\nwhether recusal was necessary. The remaining allegations are not disqualifying.\n\n        The relevant provisions of the recusal statute read as follows:\n\n        (a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any\n        proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\n\n        (b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:\n\n\n\n   30\n     We do not reach several issues argued on appeal. First, DOC contends that it may face\nliability in suits by prisoners and the public if programs are integrated and innocents are infected.\nSecond, appellants challenge several of the district court's factual findings, including its reliance\non the \"Ingram Study,\" an inmate opinion survey purporting to show an increased likelihood of\nviolence after integration, and its conclusion that certain behavior (sex between women,, sports,\nfighting, and sharing barbering equipment) posed a high risk of HIV transmission. Third, DOC\nsuggests that the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626, limits appellants' ability to\nsecure sweeping injunctive relief. On remand, the district court is free to examine these issues'\nbearing on the merits of appellants' claims and, if appropriate, on the necessity and scope of\nrelief.\n\n                                                  25\n\f                (1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal\n                knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding....\n\n28 U.S.C. § 455. Appellants argue that Judge Varner's trial comments and the hiring of DOC's\n\ncounsel's son create a reasonable question about the judge's partiality under section 455(a) and that\n\nJudge Varner's discussion with his son gave him knowledge of disputed facts in violation of section\n\n455(b)(1). In the alternative, appellants claim that all of these facts considered together would lead\n\na reasonable person to question the judge's impartiality. See Parker v. Connors Steel Co., 855 F.2d\n\n1510, 1525-26 (11th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1066, 109 S.Ct. 2066, 104 L.Ed.2d 631 (1989)\n\n(adopting totality of the circumstances approach in evaluating allegations under section 455(a)).\n\n         At trial, Judge Varner made a number of comments that appellants claim demonstrate his\n\nbias against inmates with HIV. The parties agree that the judge's bias, if any, did not stem from an\n\nextrajudicial source. As such, recusal under section 455(a) is only required if the comments reveal\n\nan antipathy for appellants intense enough to make fair judgment impossible. Liteky v. United\n\nStates, 510 U.S. 540, 554-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1157, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).\n\n        We conclude that the judge's trial statements do not indicate a bias so severe as to call into\n\nquestion the fairness of the trial. The court opined on numerous occasions that inmates are\n\nunpredictable and untrustworthy, and it also pressed DOC's counsel to elicit trial testimony about\n\nthe horrors of dying from AIDS. The former statement is perhaps an unfair generalization insofar\n\nas it applies to certain members of the appellant class, but it is not proof of severe prejudice. See\nid. (referring, as example of disqualifying bias, to case where district court allegedly professed\n\ndifficulty in objectivity toward German-Americans because their \" \"hearts are reeking with\n\ndisloyalty' \") (quoting Berger v. United States, 255 U.S. 22, 41 S.Ct. 230, 65 L.Ed. 481 (1921)). The\n\nlatter statement is unobjectionable; the court requested evidence on the amount of suffering\n\ninvolved in advanced cases of HIV infection because it believed such information was part of the\n\nlegal test that it had to apply.31\n\n   31\n    Arline 's fourth factor is \"the probabilities the disease will be transmitted and will cause\nvarying degrees of harm.\" 480 U.S. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 (quotation omitted). In chambers,\n\n                                                 26\n\f        Appellants also allege that Judge Varner was obligated to recuse himself under section\n\n455(a) because the fact that his law clerk's father was lead counsel for DOC creates a reasonable\n\nquestion about the judge's impartiality. It is true that a law clerk's involvement in a case and his or\n\nher relationship to one of the parties may constitute grounds for the judge's disqualification. See,\n\ne.g., Parker, 855 F.2d at 1524-25 (recusal was required where judge's clerk was son of senior partner\n\nin firm representing party, the father was himself a former law clerk to the judge, the son held a\n\nhearing with the parties present but not the judge, and the judge thanked the law clerk in his order\n\nfor the clerk's extensive work on the case).\n\n        Law clerk conflicts, however, are not necessarily judicial conflicts, and we conclude that\n\nJudge Varner did not abuse his discretion in denying disqualification on this ground. The court\n\nstated unequivocally in its order that the clerk had no involvement in this case, and the clerk's father\n\nsubmitted an affidavit representing that he instructed his son not to take any action with regard to\n\nthe suit. These averments satisfy us that disqualification was not required. See Parker, 855 F.2d\n\nat 1525 (recusal \"might have been avoided if [the judge] would have taken steps to isolate [the clerk]\n\nfrom this case\"); Hunt v. American Bank & Trust Co., 783 F.2d 1011, 1015-16 (11th Cir.1986) (\"If\n\na clerk has a possible conflict of interest, it is the clerk, not the judge, who must be disqualified.\").\n\n        As a final basis for disqualification, appellants allege that, during an in-chambers status\n\nconference, Judge Varner revealed that he had discussed disputed material issues with his son.\n\nCounsel for appellants testified that \"Judge Varner stated that he had spoken with his son, who is\n\na doctor, about transmission of the virus and that his son had told him that there was a risk of\n\ntransmission in some of the contexts subject to retrial on remand.\" Affidavit of Margaret Winter,\n\nSept. 6, 1994, at 1-2. DOC's counsel rejoined that \"Judge Varner did not make any statement closely\n\nresembling\" appellants' account. Affidavit of David Byrne, Jr., Sept. 8, 1994, at 2. DOC contends\n\n\n\nthe court merely inquired about the phrase \"will cause varying degrees of harm.\" We do not\nnecessarily agree with the court's view of this snippet of Arline (as the balancing test already\naccounts for \"the severity of the risk\"), but appellants unfairly take the court's legal inquiry out\nof context.\n\n                                                   27\n\fthat the discussion in chambers concerned the issue of how HIV can be transmitted, that Judge\n\nVarner expressed his view that the medical community was divided on the issue, and that Judge\n\nVarner also mentioned his son's illegible handwriting, but that the latter statement was unconnected\n\nto the prior discussion about issues for trial. Id. For his part, Judge Varner did not deny that the\n\nconversation took place, nor did he dispute appellants' characterization of the substance of the\n\ndiscussion. Instead, the court held that the conversation could not form the basis for recusal because\n\nof the court's conclusion that the reported statements were not disputed in the case; the court then\n\nquoted portions of this court's prior opinion acknowledging that the risk of HIV transmission exists\n\nin prisons generally. Opinion of Sept. 19, 1994, at 11-12.\n\n        Extrajudicial fact-finding by a judge is improper because it cannot be \"tested by the tools\n\nof the adversary process.\" Edgar v. K.L., 93 F.3d 256, 259 (7th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----,\n\n117 S.Ct. 949, 136 L.Ed.2d 837 (1997). That is, \" \"a judge cannot be, or cannot appear to be,\n\nimpartial if he has personal knowledge of evidentiary facts that are in dispute.' \" United States v.\n\nAlabama, 828 F.2d 1532, 1545 (11th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1210, 108 S.Ct. 2857, 101\n\nL.Ed.2d 894 (1988) (quoting Thode, Reporter's Notes to Code of Judicial Conduct 62 (1973)).\n\nConsequently, section 455(b)(1) creates a self-enforcing duty to recuse if a judge, outside of his or\n\nher judicial capacity, gains knowledge of facts material to the case. Id.\n\n       Whether section 455(b)(1) mandated disqualification is a difficult question based upon the\nrecord before us. We cannot tell from the parties' representations or the court's order what\n\ninformation Judge Varner's doctor-son may have conveyed to him. It is unclear, for instance, what\n\nappellants' counsel meant by the phrase \"some of the contexts subject to retrial on remand.\"\n\nConsequently, we are unable to assess whether the conversation covered the risks of transmission\n\nin prison programs, an issue that is both material to the case and in dispute. Given these\n\ncircumstances, we could remand for a hearing into the nature of the alleged conversation, see Easley\n\nv. University of Mich. Bd. of Regents, 853 F.2d 1351, 1358 (6th Cir.1988), so that we might better\n\nassess whether disqualification was necessary, but we do not do so here. We think it wise to reserve\n\n\n                                                  28\n\fjudgment on whether or not Judge Varner's conversation with his son required recusal under section\n\n455(b)(1). Likewise, we decline appellants' invitation to find Judge Varner's conduct inappropriate\n\nunder section 455(a)'s more general proscription against partiality.\n\n        Instead, we invoke this court's supervisory authority over the courts of this circuit and chart\n\na middle course. Because we are remanding this case for further proceedings, reassignment to a\n\ndifferent judge is an option pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2106, which permits courts of appeals to\n\n\"require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\" In deciding\n\nwhether to reassign, we consider whether the district judge would have difficulty putting his or her\n\nprevious views and feelings about a case aside on remand, whether assignment to a new judge is\n\nappropriate to preserve the appearance of justice, and whether reassignment will create such waste\n\nand duplication as to outweigh its benefits. Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., 123 F.3d 1353 (11th\n\nCir.1997); United States v. Remillong, 55 F.3d 572, 577-78 n. 12 (11th Cir.1995).\n\n        Even a cursory review of the district court's order reveals Judge Varner's unwillingness to\n\nput aside the conclusions he reached after the first trial. In response to the district court's blanket\n\nconclusion after the original trial that appellants were not \"otherwise qualified\" because high-risk\n\nbehavior occurs in prisons, the prior panel directed the district court to examine each challenged\n\nprogram, stating that \"general findings and prison policy\" could not justify segregation. Harris, 941\n\nF.2d at 1527. Nevertheless, on remand, the district court relied heavily on generalization and\n\ndeference to prison policy in rejecting appellants' claims. In each program for which the court\n\ndetermined that appellants were not \"otherwise qualified,\" it found that high-risk behavior and\n\nviolence against seropositive inmates were likely because they occur in prisons generally.32 Further,\n\n\n\n\n   32\n     Specifically, the district court selected segments of this court's prior opinion—wherein the\npanel observed that \"the elimination of high risk behavior ... is impossible,\" id. at 1520, and that\ntotal integration of the prison \"could likely degenerate into active violence,\" id. at 1518—and\nthen stated that there is no reason to believe that these general observations about prison are not\nalso true of specific programs. The court repeated these end-runs around the prior panel's\nremand in discussing no less than 39 of 43 programs at Tutwiler.\n\n                                                  29\n\fthe court gave unbridled deference to the decisions of prison officials, repeating the following\n\nstatement either verbatim or in substance in its analysis of nearly every challenged program:\n\n        This Court is ill-suited to instruct prison officials on the likelihood of the occurrence of high\n        risk behavior. This Court is even more ill-suited to instruct the prison system on when and\n        how to prevent such conduct when they [sic], along with their managers and medical\n        officials, determine that such conduct is likely. Because Defendant/Prison system has\n        decided that such conduct is likely, and because of the catastrophic severity of the\n        consequences if such conduct does occur, this Court holds that integrating [the specific\n        program] would present a significant risk of transmitting the deadly HIV virus.\n\nOp. at 63; see also passim. The district court's deference to policy makers, however, led it to\n\nabandon its judicial role. See, e.g., id. at 461 (\"Regardless of how much evidence is presented, no\n\ncourt will ever be as qualified as prison officials to judge the particular needs of a penal institution.\")\n\n(emphasis added).33\n\n        Reassignment is also necessary to preserve the appearance of justice. First, we believe that\n\nreasonable people would be troubled by the judge's alleged conversation with his doctor-son about\n\nthe case and about disputed evidence in addition to the court's unwillingness to forego\n\ngeneralizations about prison in analyzing particular programs. Although we lack sufficient evidence\n\nto conclude that the discussion mandated recusal, we are convinced that the situation is questionable\n\nenough to warrant reassignment. Second, the court brushed aside both precedent, see supra note 6,\n\nas well as the prior panel's remand, see supra sections II.B.3. & 5, to rule against appellants.\n\nFinally, appellants' other grounds for disqualification, although alone insufficient to mandate recusal,\nadd to the totality of the circumstances and increase the appearance of injustice.\n\n        We are not unmindful that this case is substantial, having spawned a voluminous record and\n\nhaving been litigated for nearly ten years. At the same time, however, we note that the first appeal\n\nof this case disposed of all but one of appellants' constitutional claims, and appellants have not now\n\nappealed the second denial of the remaining claim.                 Thus, the only issue left is the\n\nprogram-by-program analysis under section 504. This will surely involve additional fact finding,\n\n\n   33\n     The court also imposed the Turner test upon appellants' prima facie case, thereby giving\nprison officials added deference. See supra section II.B.3.\n\n                                                    30\n\fbut we are convinced that this additional burden is outweighed by the needs of justice and by\n\nCongress' broad mandate that \"[n]o otherwise qualified handicapped individual ... shall, solely by\n\nreason of his handicap, ... be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving\n\nFederal financial assistance....\" 28 U.S.C. § 794.\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n        Accordingly, the decision of the district court is VACATED. We REMAND for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion and with the direction to the Chief Judge of the Middle\n\nDistrict of Alabama that the case be REASSIGNED to a different district judge for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n        COX, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n        I respectfully disagree with the majority's resolution of five of the issues addressed in its\n\nopinion. First, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 does not require federal-fund grantees and\n\ntheir wards to live with even slight odds of contracting a painful and fatal disease. Second,\n\nprisoners' rights under the Rehabilitation Act, like their constitutional rights, are properly limited\n\nby legitimate penological concerns such as security. Third, the district court correctly concluded\n\nthat providing the additional security necessary to integrate the plaintiffs in all the programs at issue\n\nhere would be an undue burden on the Department of Corrections. Fourth, the district court should\n\nnot be mandated to consider programs requiring residential integration when—as the majority\nfound—the plaintiffs have waived the argument that the district court should have addressed their\n\nrights to residential integration. I would accordingly find no error in the district court's treatment\n\nof these issues. Finally, this action does not merit the extreme measure of reassignment to another\n\ndistrict judge. I agree, however, with the majority's holding that the district court's exclusion of\n\nevidence of prisoner classification as a reasonable accommodation requires remand.1 Thus, I would\n\nvacate the judgment and remand solely for the district court to reconsider whether inmate-specific\n\n\n\n   1\n    See part II.B.4 of the majority opinion.\n\n                                                   31\n\frisk evaluation is a reasonable accommodation in light of the excluded evidence concerning inmate\n\nclassification.\n\n                                              I. Background\n\n          This litigation began ten years ago in reaction to a legislatively mandated AIDS-protection\n\nprogram in Alabama's prison system. Under statute,2 the Alabama prison system tests all entering\n\ninmates for infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which causes AIDS.3 Those\n\ninmates testing positive for the virus are segregated from the general inmate population in \"HIV+\"\n\nunits, one for men at the Limestone Correctional Facility and one for women at the Julia Tutwiler\n\nPrison for Women.4 So segregated, the HIV-positive inmates are unable to participate in many\n\nprograms and activities with the HIV-negative, general population.5\n\n          The plaintiff class challenged this practice as a violation of several constitutional rights and\n\nof § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.6 The district court denied relief after a bench trial. The\n\ncourt concluded that no constitutional rights were violated. It further concluded that the plaintiffs\n\nwere not \"otherwise qualified,\" as required for rights to arise under § 504, to participate in integrated\n\nprograms because their participation would pose a significant HIV-transmission risk. This court\n\naffirmed judgment against the plaintiffs on the constitutional claims. This court held, however, that\n\n§ 504 requires a program-by-program analysis to determine if the plaintiffs merit relief.7 The action\n\nwas remanded to the district court for this fact-finding. This court directed the district court\nespecially to evaluate the risk of HIV transmission in each program. In doing so, the panel\n\n\n\n   2\n    Ala.Code § 22-11A-17(a) (1996 Supp.)\n   3\n    Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1499 (11th Cir.1991).\n   4\n    Id. at 1500.\n   5\n    Id.\n   6\n    Codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. § 794 (1994).\n   7\n    Harris, 941 F.2d at 1523.\n\n                                                    32\n\fnonetheless acknowledged that \"the court's conclusion of the significance of the risk of HIV\n\ntransmission with regard to each program [could] be unaltered.\"8\n\n          The remaining factual dispute at the trial that followed remand (and on this appeal) is\n\nnarrow. Several key facts are undisputed. In the current state of medical knowledge and art, HIV\n\ninfection inevitably progresses to AIDS. AIDS always leads to death, often after lengthy suffering.\n\nThere is likewise no dispute that HIV is transmitted through body fluids, and that transmission by\n\nblood is much more probable than transmission by any other means. The primary disputed issue is\n\nthe likelihood of blood-to-blood contact between HIV-positive and HIV-negative inmates during\n\nthe various programs in which the plaintiffs seek to participate.\n\n          The defendants presented evidence that transmission is possible in any integrated activity.\n\nThey did this in two ways. First, the defendants showed that certain activities inherently raise the\n\npossibility of blood transmission.9 Second, the defendants adduced evidence that high-risk behavior\n\n(such as anal intercourse, sharing of drug needles,10 or tattooing11) or behavior that presents the\n\npossibility of transmission (such as violent bloodshed) may occur in virtually any activity in which\n\nHIV-positive and HIV-negative prisoners mingle without supervision.12 This evidence included\n\ntestimony about and numerous incident reports of high-risk behavior in a variety of settings, from\n\n\n\n\n   8\n    Id. at 1526.\n   9\n   See, e.g., Onishea v. Herring, No. 87V-1109-N, at 31 (M.D.Ala. Dec. 29, 1995) [hereinafter\nOp.]; R.29 at 158 (barbering with unsterilized razors); Op. at 32; R.29 at 167 (sports).\n   10\n    The parties agreed that anal intercourse and sharing hypodermic needles are high-risk\nbehaviors. Op. at 27.\n   11\n        R.29 at 32.\n   12\n     See, e.g., R.29 at 145-46 (\"possibility\" exists during anger-management and\nsubstance-abuse therapy for both violent and needle-sharing behavior); id. at 179 (\"opportunity\"\nexists during data processing classes at Tutwiler for needle-sharing); id. at 177-78 (large size of\nclass and individual attention makes high-risk behavior possible in cosmetology class at\nTutwiler).\n\n                                                  33\n\fbathrooms to the kitchen to the library.13 Defense witnesses provided anecdotal evidence that even\n\nprisoners with strong incentives to behave have nonetheless run risks.14 The defense case also\n\ncontained evidence that HIV-negative prisoners will not easily tolerate integration. This evidence\n\nincluded a 1988 study of Alabama prisoners concluding that HIV-negative inmates may react\n\nviolently to integration15 and corroborating anecdotal evidence.16 Finally, the defendants presented\n\ncircumstantial evidence that Alabama's total segregation policy, one of only two in the nation, is\n\nsuperior to integrated programs in slowing HIV's spread. The all-time seroconversion rate per\n\nthousand prisoners in Alabama's prisons is .00006%, as compared to annual rates of .19, .33, and\n\n.41% in Nevada, Illinois, and Maryland, respectively, all states with integrated populations.17\n\n          The plaintiffs naturally took a different tack. While never categorically denying the\n\npossibility of transmission if a bloody fight breaks out, tattoo needles are shared, sports injuries\n\noccur, or female inmates have sex with each other, they marshaled evidence of the rarity or absence\n\nof any such incidents of transmission.18 They further presented evidence that there are no reported\n\nor witnessed incidents of anal sex, needle-sharing, or other high-risk behavior during any of the\n\nactivities in which they wish to participate.19 The plaintiffs also offered evidence that the degree of\n\n   13\n    See, e.g., R.32 at 191 (syringes smuggled into Limestone wrapped in Kotex pads); Defs.'\nExs. F-5 (needles hidden in library), F-7 (syringe in public bathroom), F-20 (unspecified\nhomosexual act in kitchen over a mixing bowl of peanut butter and jelly).\n   14\n    See R.32 at 295 (runner—who as such held a coveted job among the prisoners—engaged in\nhigh-risk behavior in the HIV unit at Limestone).\n   15\n        See R.36 at 142-43.\n   16\n   For instance, HIV-negative prisoners refused to use the same drafting tools as the\nHIV-positive inmates, for fear of contracting HIV. R.27 at 228.\n   17\n        Op. at 462.\n   18\n     See, e.g., R.27 at 35 (no documented cases of transmission through stabbing); id. at 43-44\n(never a reported incident of transmission via tattoo needles); id. at 36-39 (no confirmed cases\nof sports-related transmission); id. at 18 (only theoretical cases of sexual transmission between\nwomen have been described).\n   19\n     See, e.g., R.25 at 76-77 (no sex or needle-sharing incidents reported in cosmetology class,\njust fistfights); id. at 110 (no incidents except fistfights in sewing factory at Tutwiler); R.32 at\n\n                                                  34\n\fsurveillance in most circumstances makes such behavior implausible. Moreover, the plaintiffs'\n\nanecdotal evidence is that HIV-positive and HIV-negative prisoners in both Limestone and Tutwiler\n\nhave mingled peacefully and without HIV transmission in \"welfare committee\" meetings,20 fire\n\ndrills,21 \"Communicators' Meetings,\"22 and literacy training classes23.\n\n          Based on this record, the parties' approach to measuring the odds of transmission is\n\npredictable. On one hand, the defendants contend that transmission could happen whenever\n\nprisoners mix because of the perpetual potential for high-risk activity or for violence—and the\n\nHIV-negative prisoners' anti-HIV sentiments boost the odds of confrontation and bloodshed.\n\nHIV-positive participation in any of the programs, according to the defendants, thus poses a\n\nsignificant risk of transmission. On the other hand, the plaintiffs argue that none of the defendants'\n\nchthonic scenarios has ever been realized in prison history, and that the defendants' fear of clashes\n\nbetween HIV-positive and HIV-negative inmates is unwarranted in today's enlightened prison\n\nsociety.\n\n          The district court generally took the defendants' view, concluding that the risk of\n\ntransmission in every program was significant. While the court's reasoning was not wholly uniform\n\nfor every program, the court generally reached this result by measuring the odds based on two\n\nbackground findings, rather than extrapolating past incidents of transmission. The first finding is\n\n\n\n258 (no incidents among inmate maintenance workers at Limestone); id. at 251 (no incidents\namong tractor crew at Limestone); id. at 247-48 (no incidents on the \"double-O squad,\" which\nmaintains the prison grounds); id. at 244 (no incidents in \"college by cassette\" classes); id. at\n245 (no disciplinary incidents in the paralegal classes); id. at 246-47 (no incidents at GED and\ncollege graduation ceremonies); R.25 at 205 (no incidents in substance abuse treatment classes).\n\n   20\n        R.28 at 94.\n   21\n        R.33 at 26-27.\n   22\n     Id. at 28-29. On the other hand, one of the plaintiffs' experts also opined that \"there has to\nbe an unlearning process\" at both Tutwiler and Limestone, and that certain activities such as\ndining should therefore not be immediately integrated. See R.25 at 93.\n   23\n        R.33 at 210-12.\n\n                                                 35\n\fthat sex, intravenous drug use, and bloodshed are a perpetual possibility in prison whenever a\n\nsecurity guard trained to stop it is not watching, and that prison life is inherently\n\nunpredictable24—especially when large-scale mixing of HIV-positive and HIV-negative prisoners\n\nin Alabama is untried. The second finding is that HIV is transmitted by sex, intravenous drug use,\n\nand blood-to-blood contact. If these activities can spread HIV, and these activities can occur\n\nbetween HIV-positive and HIV-negative inmates, the court reasoned, then HIV transmission is more\n\nthan a theoretical possibility, even if we have no examples.25\n\n           From this conclusion, the court easily found this risk to be significant. After all, each case\n\nof transmission, however rare, claims at least one life. More lives could follow if the infected\n\ngeneral-population inmate spreads the virus to his dormmates. To support this inference of harm,\n\nthe court pointed to an investigation of a 1991 syphilis outbreak at Limestone in which medical\n\nofficials located 86 prisoners suspected of sexual contact with a single infected inmate.26 Given this\n\ndegree of harm, even slim odds of transmission make the risk significant. As the court put it in\n\nwords echoed throughout its 475-page opinion, \"elimination of high risk behavior is impossible....\n\nBecause the Defendant/Prison system has decided that such conduct is likely, and because of the\n\ncatastrophic severity of the consequences if such conduct does occur, this Court holds that\n\nintegrating the [program under discussion] would present a significant risk of transmitting the deadly\n\nHIV virus. Accordingly, the HIV+ inmates are not \"otherwise qualified.' \"27\n           The court took this otherwise-qualified analysis one step further. As part of its evaluation\n\nof the plaintiffs' qualifications to participate in the programs, it weighed the Department of\n\nCorrection's penological concerns, including the danger of violence that might arise from inmate\n\n\n\n   24\n        See, e.g., Op. at 211.\n   25\n        See id. at 48.\n   26\n        Op. at 464.\n   27\n        Id. at 313-314 (emphasis added); accord, e.g., id. at 82, 277-78.\n\n                                                    36\n\fprejudice toward and fear of HIV-positive prisoners.28 The court looked to Turner v. Safley, which\n\npermits infringement of prisoners' First Amendment rights provided that the prison regulation \"is\n\nreasonably related to a legitimate penological interest,\"29 as a guide to evaluating the Department\n\nof Corrections's interests. In almost every program, the court concluded that the Department of\n\nCorrections could legitimately seek to prevent violence and epidemic HIV by the measures it has\n\ntaken.\n\n           The court continued its analysis, as directed by this court,30 by asking if reasonable\n\naccommodations would make the plaintiffs qualified. Although the court found that in many\n\nprograms the plaintiffs had already been reasonably accommodated by provision of identical, but\n\nsegregated programs,31 the court found as to other programs that the only effective accommodation\n\nwould be additional guards to prevent high-risk behavior. The court concluded, however, that hiring\n\nthe dozens of guards necessary to integrate all the programs safely would place an undue financial\n\nburden on the Department of Corrections.\n\n           The plaintiffs have attacked every step of the analysis. On the \"otherwise qualified\" issue,\n\nthey contend that the district court weighed too heavily the gravity of the harm that could result if\n\nthese small risks are realized, and that the district court improperly took legitimate penological\n\nobjectives into account. Furthermore, they argue that the district court erroneously considered the\n\nburden on the Department of Corrections of accommodating all of the plaintiffs' demands, rather\n\n   28\n        Id. at 15-16.\n   29\n        482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 2261, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987).\n   30\n        Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1527 (11th Cir.1991).\n   31\n     These activities included those such as visitation, classes, haircuts, medical treatment,\nsports, and legal research. Op. at 87 (visitation at Tutwiler); id. at 326 (paralegal training\nclasses at Limestone); id. at. 336 (high-school and college level courses at Limestone); id. at\n341 (GED examination at Limestone); id. at 383 (haircuts at Limestone); id. at 407 (visitation\nat Limestone); id. at 415 (medical treatment at Limestone); id. at 435 (sports at Limestone); id.\nat 444 (legal research at Limestone). The plaintiffs briefly challenge this conclusion, but the\nmajority does not address it. I would affirm the court's finding that providing materially\nidentical activities in a separate location is a reasonable accommodation of the risks posed by the\nplaintiffs' contagious disease.\n\n                                                   37\n\fthan myopically considering whether hiring the few guards necessary to integrate each program\n\nwould individually overburden the entire prison system. These arguments present issues of law and\n\nmixed issues of law and fact; both are reviewed de novo, although findings of fact stand unless\n\nclearly erroneous.32\n\n                                                  * * *\n\n          The plaintiffs raise a final issue unrelated to the merits. They argue that Judge Varner should\n\nhave recused himself from the retrial of this case. Three circumstances, the plaintiffs contend, make\n\nrecusal mandatory: the judge's alleged consultation with his son (who is a physician) concerning\n\nthe facts of this case; the father-son relationship between Judge Varner's law clerk (who did not\n\nwork on this case) and defendants' lead counsel; and finally Judge Varner's asserted bias against the\n\nplaintiffs, as evidenced by a few of the Judge's remarks on the record during the trial. Because none\n\nof these circumstances warrant recusal, I concur in the majority's conclusion on this issue. I would\n\nrefuse, however, to undermine that conclusion by reassigning the action based on the very same\n\nfacts.\n\n                                              II. Discussion\n\n          I break with the majority's analysis of the merits of the claims asserted in this action in three\n\nways.33 These differences correspond to the three different stages of the district court's analysis:\n\nfirst, its determination that the plaintiffs were not otherwise qualified to participate in the relevant\nprograms; second, the court's inquiry into the effect of legitimate penological interests on the\n\nprisoners' Rehabilitation Act rights; and finally its consideration of reasonable accommodations,\n\na step demanded by the finding that the prisoners were not otherwise qualified. The majority holds\n\nthat the district court applied the wrong standard on the first step, improperly added the second step,\n\n   32\n        Kennedy v. Herring, 54 F.3d 678, 682 (11th Cir.1995).\n   33\n    I agree, however, that this court's earlier mandate required the district court to consider\nevidence relating to inmate classification, as that is probative of potential reasonable\naccommodations. I would therefore remand for the limited purpose of permitting the district\ncourt to revisit its reasonable accommodations analysis in light of that evidence and any\ncounterevidence the defendants may choose to offer.\n\n                                                     38\n\fand erroneously found on the last step that the plaintiffs' proposed reasonable accommodations,\n\nconsidered together rather than program by program, are unduly burdensome.\n\n          The majority's first holding requires courts to treat all transmissible illnesses equally,\n\nregardless of their consequences; this does not comport with the law. The second holding requires\n\ncourts to apply identical standards to classrooms, workplaces, and prisons, and thus does not observe\n\nboth the unique importance of security in the prison environment and limited judicial competence\n\nin the penal realm. Finally, the majority's third holding fails to focus the undue burden analysis on\n\nthe unique circumstances of a case—which here means a case in which dozens of correctional\n\nofficers would be needed to accommodate the plaintiffs in all programs, even if one officer would\n\nreasonably accommodate them in one.34\n\n                                A. \"Significant Risk,\" Not \"High Odds\"\n\n          Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,35 under which the plaintiffs seek relief,\n\nrequires a federal-fund grantee reasonably to accommodate a disability only if the disabled person\n\nis \"otherwise qualified\" for the activity.36 As the Supreme Court interpreted the statute in School\n\nBoard v. Arline,37 the \"basic factors\" for determining if the carrier of a contagious disease is\n\notherwise qualified include\n\n          [findings of] facts, based on reasonable medical judgments given the state of medical\n          knowledge, about (a) the nature of the risk (how the disease is transmitted), (b) the duration\n          of the risk (how long is the carrier infectious), (c) the severity of the risk (what is the\n\n   34\n     One further holding from which I dissent requires only brief explanation. The plaintiffs\nclaim that the district court erroneously refused to consider programs such as work release and\nboot camp that required residential integration of the plaintiffs into the general population at\nother facilities. The majority notes correctly that the plaintiffs waived all claims for residential\nintegration by not challenging on appeal the trial court's refusal to consider the issue of\nintegration. Because the plaintiffs have abandoned on appeal any claim for residential\nintegration, this court should not direct the district court—in effect end-running the waiver—to\nconsider all programs requiring residential integration. The court should instead, in light of the\nwaiver, uphold the district court's refusal to consider those programs.\n   35\n        Codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. § 794 (1994).\n   36\n        Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1522 (11th Cir.1991).\n   37\n        480 U.S. 273, 107 S.Ct. 1123, 94 L.Ed.2d 307 (1987).\n\n                                                   39\n\f              potential harm to third parties) and (d) the probabilities the disease will be transmitted and\n              will cause varying degrees of harm.38\n\nThe Court further directed the courts to \"defer to the reasonable medical judgments of public health\n\nofficials.\"39 The point, as the Court put it, is that \"[a] person who poses a significant risk of\n\ncommunicating an infectious disease to others in the workplace will not be otherwise qualified for\n\nhis or her job if reasonable accommodation will not eliminate that risk.\"40\n\n              Contrary to the majority's holding, this standard does not seek simply to identify a certain\n\npercentage possibility of transmission above which the plaintiff is not otherwise qualified. Arline\n\n's selection of factors and its language show that the significance of a risk is a product of the odds\n\nthat transmission will occur and the severity of the consequences. First, Arline 's four factors include\n\nboth \"the severity of the risk\" and the \"the probabilities the disease will be transmitted,\" not just \"the\n\nodds the virus will spread.\" This suggests that each must interplay with the other in the\n\notherwise-qualified inquiry. Second, significance by itself connotes more than size: \"significant\"\n\nmeans \"deserving to be considered,\" \"important,\" \"weighty,\" or \"notable.\"41 It does not just mean\n\n\"big.\"42 And it is the potential gravity of the harm that imbues certain odds of an event with\n\nsignificance. This is indeed common sense: to borrow an analogy from the district court's opinion,\n\nwe are far more likely to consider walking a tightrope to pose a significant risk if the rope is fifty\n\nfeet high than if it is one foot off the ground. This is so even if the odds of losing our balance are\n\nthe same however far we have to fall.\n              In the context of HIV transmission, Arline 's standard thus means that something less than\n\nhigh odds of transmission will make the plaintiffs not otherwise qualified.                   It has been\n\n   38\n        Id. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 (quoting Br. for American Med.

These\n\nhorrendous consequences render even very low odds of transmission enough to make a risk\n\nsignificant. The other circuits that have confronted this issue directly have indeed so interpreted\n\nArline 's standard. The Fourth Circuit has affirmed a district court's conclusion that an HIV-positive\n\nneurosurgery resident could be barred from surgery, notwithstanding the fact that there were no\n\ndocumented cases of surgeon-to-patient HIV transmittal.43 Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has held that\n\na \"small\" chance of blood-to-blood contact between an HIV-positive surgical assistant and his\n\npatients nonetheless constitutes a \"significant\" risk: \"A cognizable risk of permanent duration with\n\nlethal consequences suffices\" to disqualify the assistant.44\n\n        Based on Arline 's standard thus interpreted, the district court's conclusion was correct. First,\n\nthe district court finding of a cognizable possibility of transmission has record support. The court\n\nfound as fact the following: that blood-to-blood contact likely transmits HIV; that violence,\n\nintravenous drug use, and sex may cause blood contact and occur in prisons in the most unlikely and\n\nunexpected places; and that it is impossible to know or surveil much of what goes on. These\n\nsubsidiary findings, which are supported by expert and lay testimony, legitimately support the\n\nconclusion that mixing prisoners raises a cognizable possibility of spreading HIV. \"Conjecture,\" as\n\n\n   43\n    Doe v. University of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1266 (4th Cir.1995). The court\nnoted that the Centers for Disease Control estimate the risk of transmission from an HIV-positive\nsurgeon to a single patient to be between one in 42,000 and one in 417,000.

Woodhaven Learning Ctr., 865 F.2d 930, 941 (8th Cir.1989) (concluding that a\nhepatitis B carrier posed a significant risk, because even though the risk of transmission to those\ntreated immediately after blood-to-blood contact is 2.5%, 1% of those infected would eventually\ndie from the disease). This circuit's law is not to the contrary. Martinez v. School Board, 861\nF.2d 1502, 1506 (11th Cir.1988), which the majority cites as requiring a high probability of\ntransmission to render a plaintiff not otherwise qualified, is distinguishable. Unlike here, the\ndistrict court in that action did not even consider certain transmission risks, such as through\nblood. Instead, the district court found that there was a \"remote theoretical possibility\" of\ntransmission through other bodily fluids and ended the inquiry there. Id. This court held that the\nrisks of transmission through tears, saliva, and urine in the case's classroom setting did not reach\na significant level of risk, but the court remanded for further findings as to the possibility of\nblood transmission. Id. Here, of course, the district court based its finding of significant risk on\nall possible transmission methods.\n\n                                                   41\n\fthe majority calls it, it may be, but the district court has no other option in this case. After all, Arline\n\n's standard requires the court to measure risk. Measuring risk is predicting the future. Unless the\n\njudge is a seer, he must predict the future by drawing inferences from both current conditions and\n\npast events. It may be preferable to extrapolate past events, but in this case that would, in effect,\n\nimpose a somebody-has-to-die-first standard—the risk is not cognizable until someone dies from\n\nthe conditions posing the risk. This court should reject such a standard.\n\n          Next, the district court properly concluded that this risk was significant.             Arline 's\n\nsliding-scale standard authorized the court to cleave to caution and find the risk significant in a case\n\nsuch as this when death is a certain result of the possible event. The district court's conclusion also\n\ncomported with Arline in another significant respect: Arline urges circumspection when a finding\n\nmay contravene the judgment of public health professionals.45 Prison officials charged with\n\nprotecting prisoners' health have determined that this policy is justified, and the court properly\n\nhesitated before rejecting their judgment. The district court's conclusion that the plaintiffs'\n\nparticipation in the programs poses a significant risk to others' health, and that the plaintiffs thus are\n\nnot otherwise qualified, should be upheld.\n\n                                           B. Security Matters\n\n          In its otherwise-qualified inquiry, the district court also reviewed the four factors suggested\n\nin Turner v. Safley46 to determine whether the defendants' security concerns disqualified the\nplaintiffs from participating in the programs.47 The trial court concluded that the likelihood of\ninmate resentment and fear of the HIV-positive prisoners made violence a reasonable worry, and that\n\nthe wardens were therefore justified in separating the HIV-positive prisoners from the HIV-negative.\n\n\n\n   45\n        Arline, 480 U.S. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131.\n   46\n        482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987).\n   47\n     For one program, interstate prisoner exchange, the district court pretermitted the rest of its\notherwise-qualified analysis and concluded that legitimate penological concerns alone warranted\nthe plaintiff's exclusion.

The law-of-the-case doctrine \"comes into play only with respect to issues previously\n\ndetermined.\"48 An appeals court may impliedly resolve an issue.49 But for that resolution to govern\n\nall subsequent proceedings, the issue must necessarily have been decided.50 The doctrine does not\n\nembrace all issues that could have been addressed,51 even if addressing them would have been\n\nappropriate.52\n\n          An implied holding is at best what we have from the first panel's opinion, which is silent on\n\nTurner 's application. And we should not infer any holding at all on Turner from the panel's silence.\n\nAfter all, the issue was not before the court. Following the first trial, the district court denied the\n\nplaintiffs relief on their Rehabilitation Act claim on the finding that the plaintiffs were not otherwise\n\nqualified because \"the probability of transmission, in the prison environment, is significant\" in all\n\nprograms, without an individuated assessment.53 The plaintiffs challenged this conclusion on one\n\n   48\n    Quern v.

Many panels so\n\ndecide.55 Furthermore, whether Turner 's factors may weigh into otherwise-qualified analysis was\n\nnot an issue the court had to resolve before holding that the Rehabilitation Act requires a\n\nprogram-by-program qualifications assessment. There is, therefore, no law of the case relating to\n\nthis issue.\n\n          The issue is accordingly now before this court. This court should hold, as the Ninth Circuit\n\nhas,56 that Turner 's factors are relevant to Rehabilitation Act claims arising in prison. Four reasons\n\nsupport this conclusion. First, Turner 's concerns apply equally to statutory claims even though\n\nTurner 's holding is limited to constitutional claims. In either case, federal judges have no business\n\nsitting in the warden's seat:\n\n          [T]he problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable, and, more to the point,\n          they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree.... Running a prison is an\n          inordinately difficult undertaking that requires expertise, planning, and the commitment of\n          resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive\n          branches of government. Prison administration is, moreover, a task that has been committed\n          to the responsibility of those branches, and separation of powers concerns counsel a policy\n          of judicial restraint. Where a state penal system is involved, federal courts have, as we\n          indicated in Martinez [Procunier v., 416 U.S. 396, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974) ],\n          additional reason to accord deference to the appropriate prison authorities.57\n\n\n\n\n   54\n        Appellants' Br., Harris v. Thigpen, Nos. 90-7083, 90-7100, at 42-50.\n   55\n     See, e.g., United States v.

In both cases, the\n\njudges run into the same problems of lack of experience and expertise when they begin to interfere\n\nwith matters traditionally left to the legislative and executive branches. Here, moreover, Congress's\n\nenactment of the statute does not put a legislative stamp of approval on judicial intrusion into state\n\nprison administration. Congress apparently never thought about prisons when it passed the\n\nRehabilitation Act. The words \"prison\" and \"prisoner\" do not occur in the legislative history.\n\nSection 504 does not mention prisons. In short, \"[t]here is no indication that Congress intended the\n\nAct to apply to prison facilities irrespective of the considerations of the reasonable requirements of\n\neffective prison administration.\"58\n\n          Second, federal judicial second-guessing of the legitimate penological decisions of state\n\nauthorities, even when statutorily prompted, runs squarely counter to the most basic notions of\n\ncomity. Prison administration is a core state function.59 \"It is difficult to imagine an activity in\n\nwhich a State has a stronger interest, or one that is more intricately bound up with state laws,\n\nregulations, and procedures, than the administration of its prisons.\"60 In this realm, federal courts\n\nshould await a clear statement from Congress before construing statutes as a license to dictate state\n\npolicy.61 Taking the Rehabilitation Act's silence as to application in the prison environment to mean\n\nthat its effect in prison is identical to that elsewhere does not comport with this \"clear statement\"\n\nrule.

The Fourth Circuit has indeed held that the\nRehabilitation Act does not apply to state prisons at all because of the Act's lack of an\nappropriate \"clear statement.\" Amos v. Maryland Dep't of Pub. Safety & Correctional Servs., 7\nA.D. Cases 454 (4th Cir.1997). While the applicability of the Rehabilitation Act to state prisons\nis law of the case for this panel, the issue may merit en banc attention.\n\n                                                 45\n\ffactors, which carry an element of deference to prison authorities, provides a means of avoiding\n\nundue interference in state affairs without a clear congressional direction.\n\n          Third, Arline 's standard, born in an action by a teacher plaintiff, is inadequate for the prison\n\nsetting. While Arline acknowledges that the Rehabilitation Act does not require the federal-fund\n\ngrantee, or its wards, to run significant risks of any kind,62 its rule views those risks as solely ones\n\nto health from the disease. In a classroom setting, or in the surgical theater,63 these risks may be the\n\nonly dangers that the communicable disease poses. But in prison, mixing carriers of a virus that is\n\nconsidered loathsome, however wrongly, with those who do not have the virus runs the risk of\n\nviolence. The district court so found, and cases elsewhere show that such violence is not unknown.64\n\nThis danger—whether or not it leads to HIV transmission—warrants consideration along with health\n\nrisks, and Turner 's factors offer a vehicle for taking into account hazards that are unique to the\n\nprison context.\n\n          Fourth, considering Turner 's factors in a prison Rehabilitation Act case is wholly consistent\n\nwith the statute. As Arline 's holding makes clear, § 504 does not command the federal-fund grantee\n\nto endanger its wards.65 And in the employment context from which Arline sprang, Congress has\n\nembraced the principle of safety-threat limitations. This concern for safety enters into § 504 by way\n\n\n   62\n     Arline, 480 U.S. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1130-31 (describing the inquiry under its standard as\n\"essential if § 504 is to achieve its goal of protecting handicapped individuals from deprivations\nbased on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to such\nlegitimate concerns of grantees as avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety\nrisks\") (emphasis added).\n   63\n    See Doe v.

Turner 's factors\n\noffer a means to implement these safety limitations in the prison setting.\n\n          For these reasons, the district court did not err in taking into account the defendants' security\n\nconcerns that lead to segregating the HIV-positive prisoners in the programs at issue. Nor did the\n\ndistrict court err in its analysis of Turner 's factors.69 A key fact-finding, which was adequately\n\nbased on survey evidence and the presence of an intervenor inmate class that opposes integration\n\nof the programs, is that there are still many inmates who would react negatively—indeed,\n\nviolently—to integration. Application of Turner 's four factors to this case's circumstances in light\n\nof this fact supports the district court's conclusion that security concerns disqualify the plaintiffs.\n\nFirst, security is a classically legitimate penological concern, and the court could conclude that\n\nseparating prisoners who, if mixed, would react violently, has a rational connection to preventing\n\nviolence. This factor weighs against the plaintiffs. Turner 's second factor weighs in the plaintiffs'\nfavor: they have no other way of participating in integrated programs. The third factor, however,\n\nweighs heavily against the plaintiffs; the district court could properly conclude, based on sufficient\n\nevidence of inmate prejudice, that mixing HIV-positive and HIV-negative inmates could cause\n\nripple effects that threatened security, either because of anti-HIV prejudice or as a result of the\n\n   66\n        29 U.S.C. § 794(d) (1994).\n   67\n        Codified at 42 U.S.C. § 12113(b) (1994).\n   68\n        Id.; see E.E.O.C. v.

Finally, the\n\ncourt properly concluded that there are no \"obvious, easy alternatives\" here: plaintiffs' implication\n\nthat integration is an easy alternative because other prison facilities follow it does not undermine the\n\ncourt's conclusion. Given its findings concerning the substantially higher seroconversion rates and\n\nincidence of violence elsewhere, the court could properly find that integration elsewhere served the\n\ninterests of security and health less reasonably than the policies under attack here. Thus, the district\n\ncourt's otherwise-qualified findings should be upheld.\n\n                         C. Isolated Versus Global Burden of Accommodation\n\n           The Rehabilitation Act deems a disabled person qualified to participate in an activity if\n\nreasonable accommodations remove any disqualification.70               One of the plaintiffs' primary\n\nreasonable-accommodation suggestions was the hiring of more guards to provide the surveillance\n\nnecessary to prevent the plaintiffs and HIV-negative inmates from engaging in high-risk behavior.\n\nThe district court found that the plaintiffs' recommended level of security staffing would not prevent\n\nhigh-risk behavior, but implied that the Department of Corrections' claimed necessary level of\n\nstaffing—60 additional guards all together—would adequately reduce the risk.71 This level of\n\nstaffing, the court concluded, would place an undue financial and administrative burden on the\n\nalready-strapped prison system.72 This conclusion was based on the effect system-wide of\n\naccommodating the plaintiffs in all the programs at issue: the court emphasized that it would \"see\n\"the forest as well as the individual trees.' \"73 The plaintiffs claim that the district court erred either\nby failing to consider the burden in each program separately or, alternatively, by failing to pick\n\nparticular programs to which limited resources should be allocated.74 The plaintiffs suggest that the\n\n   70\n        Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1525 (11th Cir.1991).\n   71\n        Op. at 51-53.\n   72\n        Id. at 53.\n   73\n        Id. at 51.\n   74\n        Appellants' Br. at 41-42.\n\n                                                    48\n\fcourt should have compared the cost of each individual guard to the Department of Corrections'\n\nentire budget to determine if each guard alone would be a reasonable accommodation.\n\n        The district court did not err. Whether an accommodation imposes an undue burden on a\n\ndefendant is determined by \"the hardships imposed by the plaintiff's preferred accommodation in\n\nthe context of the particular agency's operations.\"75 And cost is a hardship properly taken into\n\naccount in assessing whether the burden on a federal-fund grantee is undue.76 Assessing that cost\n\naccommodation-by-accommodation, and not in the aggregate, effectively defeats the purpose of the\n\nagency-specific analysis: it permits impositions of burdens that could nickel-and-dime an agency\n\nto extinction. That reasoning ignores, rather than examines, the \"context of the particular agency's\n\noperations.\" Thus, if the plaintiffs demand to be accommodated system-wide, the total cost to the\n\nDepartment of Corrections is the relevant cost for determining the agency's burden. Adding 60\n\nguards at Tutwiler and Limestone, as the record suggests are needed to ensure security, would\n\nrequire a nearly 20% increase in guard staffing.77 The district court could conclude based on this\n\nrecord that accommodation by an increase in staffing would place an undue hardship on the\n\nDepartment of Corrections.\n\n        The plaintiffs further fault the district court for not considering whether the Department of\n\nCorrections in fact needed all the guards it currently has stationed where they are currently stationed,\n\nand for not choosing certain programs for integration if it is indeed true that providing all the guards\nnecessary would be an undue burden. The plaintiffs cite no evidence in the record, however, that\n\nindicates that any guards elsewhere are unnecessary. To the contrary, the record suggests that both\n\n\n\n   75\n    Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 286 n. 2 (11th Cir.1997) (emphasis added) (quoting\nBarth v. Gelb, 2 F.3d 1180, 1187 (D.C.Cir.1993)).\n   76\n    See, e.g., Borkowski v. Valley Cent. School Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 138 (2d Cir.1995); Vande\nZande v. State of Wis. Dep't of Admin., 44 F.3d 538, 543 (7th Cir.1995) (both identifying undue\nhardship analysis as a species of cost-benefit inquiry).\n   77\n     The record suggests, moreover, that the additional staffing would be more expensive. To\nget guards for the HIV unit, Limestone must currently pay those guards more. R.32 at 110.\n\n                                                  49\n\fTutwiler and Limestone are already staffed significantly below the optimum.78 Nor do the plaintiffs\n\npropose a basis upon which the district court should have allocated any portion of the necessary\n\nadditional guards. The plaintiffs thus failed to carry their burden of proof that alternate, less\n\nburdensome reasonable accommodations exist by moving correctional officers from other posts to\n\nHIV-protection posts. The district court's conclusion should accordingly be upheld.\n\n                             D. Reassignment to Another District Judge\n\n          The plaintiffs in this case sought Judge Varner's recusal on a variety of grounds. Judge\n\nVarner refused to recuse himself, and the plaintiffs appeal the denial of their motion and suggest,\n\nin the alternative, that the case be assigned on remand to another judge. Among the reasons for this\n\nremedy they point to Judge Varner's remarks on the bench and in his opinion, the judge's law clerk's\n\nfather-son relationship to the defendants' lead counsel, and the judge's possible learning of facts\n\npertinent to the medical issues in this case from the judge's son, a physician. The majority properly\n\nconcludes that the record does not sufficiently evince bias or impropriety that required Judge Varner\n\nto recuse himself under the Supreme Court's interpretation of 28 U.S.C. § 455.79 But the majority\n\nthen adopts a \"middle course\"—reassigning the action—that leaves Judge Varner stained with\n\nimpropriety's brush. This \"middle course\" is extreme and unnecessary in this case.\n\n          Reassignment is rare in this circuit and is generally appropriate only when three factors\n\nweigh in favor of it: (1) whether the original judge would have had difficulty putting his previous\nviews and findings aside; (2) whether reassignment is appropriate to preserve the appearance of\n\njustice; and (3) whether reassignment would entail waste and duplication out of proportion to the\n\ngains realized from reassignment.80 None of these factors points to reassignment in this case.\n\n\n   78\n    Warden Lobmiller of Tutwiler requested 179 guards in 1993 and was authorized to employ\n90. R.35 at 13-14. The Limestone facility is approximately forty guards short of full staffing.\nR.32 at 106.\n   79\n    Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 554-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1157, 127 L.Ed.2d 474\n(1994).\n   80\n        Torkington, 874 F.2d at 1446.\n\n                                                 50\n\f        The first prong is satisfied only by a showing of extreme conduct—for example, when a\n\njudge has willfully refused to follow this court's mandate,81 or when the judge has made such\n\nmistakes that in the court of appeals' eyes the court appears unjust.82 Judge Varner's greatest offense,\n\nhowever, is that he disagreed with the plaintiffs. Far from ignoring this court's mandate, his 475-\n\npage opinion meticulously reviews the individual evidence about the location, circumstances, and\n\nsecurity concerns for dozens and dozens of separate programs. Nor is the appearance of justice\n\nimperiled here. As the majority observes, Judge Varner's remarks do not show any bias mandating\n\nrecusal,83 and the evidence of impropriety is also insufficient to warrant recusal. This court should\n\non this record be as hesitant to direct reassignment as it is to find recusal to be mandated. Finally,\n\nthe extraordinary waste of judicial resources that would result on remand if we shift judges after ten\n\nyears of litigation and two trials counsels leaving the case before Judge Varner. I would therefore\n\nrefuse to direct reassignment to another district judge.\n\n                                           III. Conclusion\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, I would vacate the district court's judgment and remand for the\n\nlimited purpose of permitting the district court to reconsider, in light of plaintiffs' and defendants'\n\nevidence of prisoner classification, whether classification offers the basis for a reasonable\n\n\n   81\n     See, e.g., United States v. Remillong, 55 F.3d 572, 577 (11th Cir.1995) (reassigning case\nafter the district judge \"stubbornly persisted\" in disregard of this court's mandate); Clark v.\nCoats & Clark, 990 F.2d 1217, 1230 (11th Cir.1993) (reassigning case when the district judge's\nopinion \"contained strong language expressing dissatisfaction with this court's decision\").\n   82\n     See, e.g., Chudasama v.

The\n\nappellant class, which consists of Alabama inmates who are HIV-positive (\"HIV+\" or\n\"seropositive\"), claims that excluding HIV+ prisoners from these programs violates the\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (\"section 504\" or \"the Act\"). A prior panel\n\nof this court, on an appeal by these appellants from a post-trial dismissal of their class action,\n\nremanded the section 504 claim \"for additional findings and clarification by the district court.\"\n\nHarris v.

The state incarcerates men testing positive at the Limestone Correctional Facility\n\n(\"Limestone\") and women testing positive at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women (\"Tutwiler\").\n\nEach of these prisons houses HIV+ inmates in a separate unit. Seropositive prisoners not only live\n\napart from non-infected inmates, but, in addition, \"they have not been able to participate in most of\n\nthe programs available to general population prisoners, while in other cases, the segregated\n\nprogramming provided to them is not comparable.\" Harris, 941 F.2d at 1521-22.1\n\n          Carmen Harris filed suit in 1987 and later became the named plaintiff of the class of\n\nprisoners seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against DOC. The class claimed that Alabama's\n\nHIV policy violated several constitutional provisions and section 504. The district court rejected\n\neach of the class' claims. Harris v.

The prior panel\n\naffirmed the district court's principal constitutional rulings,2 but vacated its statutory ruling. Noting\n\nthe absence of any \"particularized inquiry\" by the district court, the panel established the law of the\n\ncase by remanding for \"full findings of fact and conclusions of law as to each program and activity\n\nfrom which HIV-positive prisoners are being excluded, and a proper weighing of the dangers of\n\ntransmission in each context.\" 941 F.2d at 1527.\n\n          On remand, appellant Onishea was substituted as named plaintiff for Harris, who died during\nthe litigation.

We discuss the\n\nessential statutory elements of a cause of action under the Act and then address the specific\n\nchallenges to the district court's decision.\n\n                                                  A.\n\n        Section 504 states: \"No otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by\n\nreason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\n\nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance....\"\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794. Thus, appellants' prima facie case of unlawful discrimination under the Act\n\nconsists of four elements:\n\n        1) they are \"handicapped\" within the meaning of the Act; 2) they are \"otherwise qualified\";\n        3) they are excluded from programs or activities solely because of the handicap; and 4) the\n        programs or activities from which they are excluded are operated by an agency that receives\n        federal financial assistance.\n\nHarris, 941 F.2d at 1522.

They argue that if they can\nshow that one of their number can be integrated safely into a prison program, then the class as a\nwhole is entitled to a declaration that the categorical ban on seropositive inmates' participation in\nthat program violates the Act. This argument is not without appeal, especially in view of section\n504's preference for individualized treatment. See, e.g., Arline, 480 U.S. at 284, 107 S.Ct. at\n1129 (\"The fact that some persons who have contagious diseases may pose a serious health\nthreat to others under certain circumstances does not justify excluding from the coverage of the\nAct all persons with actual or perceived contagious diseases.\"). Moreover, common sense tells\nus that if one class member can establish his or her eligibility for a prison program, then the\ncategorical ban is in tension with section 504's goals. Nevertheless, we conclude that the prior\nopinion in this case precludes an inquiry that focuses on a particular individual's eligibility for\nspecific programs. The panel directed the district court to determine whether appellants were\n\"otherwise qualified\" in light of \"the risk of HIV transmission with regard to each program,\"\n941 F.2d at 1526, and \"to examine as to each program whether \"reasonable accommodations' by\nthe DOC could minimize such a risk to an acceptable level.\" Id. at 1527 (emphasis added).\nBecause the prior panel directed the district court to undertake such an inquiry and because a\nprogram-level assessment of risk in this case is not plainly inconsistent with section 504, see\nArline, 480 U.S. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 (individualized inquiry is necessary \"in most cases,\"\nbut not all), we reject appellants' argument based on the law of the case doctrine.\n\n                                                  6\n\f                                                  1.\n\n        Appellants argue that circuit precedent places the burden on defendants to prove at trial that\n\nplaintiffs are not otherwise qualified or could not be made so with reasonable accommodation, but\n\nthat the district court erroneously placed that burden on appellants. The district court concluded that\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act requires plaintiffs to bear the burden of showing that they are qualified to\n\nparticipate in a program or that an accommodation is available that will make them qualified.\n\nAlthough we do not adopt the district court's reasoning,6 we conclude that it properly allocated the\n\nburdens in the present case.\n\n       In Treadwell v.

Unlike section 504, section 501 requires agencies to\n\nundertake affirmative action in favor of disabled people. See id.

Arline, 480 U.S. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131. The central issue\n\nbefore the district court on remand concerned the fourth factor—the probability of transmission in\n\nspecific programs. Appellants claim that the district court erroneously applied an unduly exacting\n\nstandard in ruling that they could not be \"otherwise qualified\" for a program if there were any risk\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fof transmission from HIV+ inmates' participation. We agree that the district court demanded proof\n\nbeyond that which the Act requires.\n\n       In Arline, the Supreme Court held that persons with infectious diseases are \"otherwise\n\nqualified\" unless, based upon four factors, their contagion poses \"significant health and safety risks\n\n\" to others, 480 U.S. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1130 (emphasis added). At the same time, however, a\n\nfootnote suggested that one of these factors would have determinative weight in certain cases. The\n\nCourt remarked: \"A person who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to\n\nothers in the workplace will not be otherwise qualified for his or her job if reasonable\n\naccommodation will not eliminate that risk.\" Id. at 287 n. 16, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 n. 16 (emphasis\n\nadded). Thus, the Court seemed to distinguish between significant health risks and significant\n\ntransmission risks and implied that a less than significant risk of transmission, no matter what the\n\ndisease, alone could not suffice to justify a person's exclusion from a federally-funded program.\n\n       The district court resolved the arguable tension between Arline 's significant health risk\n\nstandard and its significant transmission risk footnote by declaring the latter to be a misstatement.\n\nIt opined that \"[a] strict reading of this could suggest that in analyzing whether reasonable\n\naccommodations would render one \"otherwise qualified,' the trial court should ignore the remaining\n\nArline factors ... and consider only the probability of transmission.\" Op. at 47. The district court\n\nthen asked: \"May this Court not weigh the catastrophic nature, duration, and severity against a\nlightweight probability of transmission?\" Id. In the end, the district court concluded that a small\n\npossibility of transmission—but more than a remote theoretical possibility—would suffice to justify\n\nexclusion of HIV+ persons from programs receiving federal funds.\n\n       This circuit's law is to the contrary. In Martinez v. School Bd. of Hillsborough County, Fla.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514785\"><a href=\"/opinion/514785/eliana-martinez-by-and-through-her-next-friend-rosa-e-martinez-her/\"><span class=\"volume\">861</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir.1988), we held that the district court erred in upholding the exclusion of\n\nan HIV+ child from special education classes. The school board argued that the child might transmit\n\nHIV to her classmates and teachers through saliva, tears, and excrement. The district court found\n\nthat a \"remote theoretical possibility\" of transmission existed in an integrated program and ordered\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fthe student segregated. Id. at 1506. We rejected the district court's analysis because it required too\n\nrigorous a showing; the likelihood of transmission did not \"rise to the \"significant' risk level that\n\nis required\" under section 504. Id. In announcing this standard, we cited the Arline footnote that the\n\ndistrict court in the present case declared irrelevant, and we remanded for \"findings as to the overall\n\nrisk of transmission. ...\" Id. (emphasis added).\n\n       The district court in this case distinguished Martinez, which involved transmission through\n\nmeans that were only theoretically possible (e.g., saliva and tears), from this case, which involves\n\nestablished transmission pathways (e.g., sex and needle sharing). Although correct, this observation\n\ndoes not vitiate Martinez 's announcement of a significant transmission risk test in cases involving\n\nHIV. Moreover, it ignores the fact that the prior panel hearing this case, citing both Martinez and\n\nthe Arline footnote, endorsed the significant risk of transmission standard for this specific set of\n\nfacts,. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1525 (\"If, after reasonable accommodations, a significant risk of\n\ntransmission of the infectious disease still exists, a plaintiff will not be considered \"otherwise\n\nqualified' ....\") (emphasis added).\n\n       The district court bolstered its decision to deviate from the significant risk standard by\n\nreferring to non-circuit precedent, but gave the mistaken impression that courts have uniformly\n\neschewed the significant transmission risk test in HIV cases. We are aware that the Fourth and Fifth\n\nCircuits have declared that HIV+ medical workers who pose a less than significant risk of\ntransmitting HIV may, consistent with section 504, be prohibited from performing invasive\n\nprocedures.

Epidemiologic evidence indicates that transmission of HIV requires intimate, rather\n\nthan casual, human contact that involves the exchange of certain bodily fluids. Harris, 941 F.2d at\n\n1503. At the same time, the record evidence in this case shows that HIV infection is incurable and\n\npotentially fatal.8 Id. at 1502-03. Because the Arline factors point in different directions, then,\n\ndetermining the overall significance of the risk to third parties depends in large part on assessing the\n\nlikelihood of behavior that would allow transmission of HIV. We realize that HIV infection frightens\n\nmost people because of its life-threatening nature. By enacting section 504, however, Congress has\ndirected its grantees to accept some risks and has prohibited them from unduly indulging their fears.\n\nSee Abbott v. Bragdon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736905\"><a href=\"/opinion/736905/sidney-abbott-v-randon-bragdon-dmd/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 946-48 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[A] service provider like Dr. Bragdon\n\nis not entitled to demand absolute safety; he can rely upon the direct threat defense only in response\n\nto significant risks.\").\n\n\n   8\n    It was uncontested at trial that the normal progression of HIV infection leads to an\nAIDS-related death. By the time that the facts of this case are considered anew, that fact may\nhave changed. On remand, we leave it to the district court's discretion how best to discharge its\nresponsibility to assess the dangers of HIV infection \"based on reasonable medical judgments\ngiven the state of medical knowledge. ...\" Arline, 480 U.S. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 (internal\nquotation omitted) (emphasis added).\n\n                                                  12\n\f        We therefore conclude that the district court erred in holding that a less than significant risk\n\nof transmitting HIV justifies appellants' segregation from all programs. Further, a review of the\n\ncourt's decision reveals that this legal conclusion permeated its program-specific findings.\n\nThroughout its opinion, the court ruled that appellants were not \"otherwise qualified\" without any\n\nattempt to quantify whether a sufficient risk of transmission existed to warrant categorical\n\nexclusion.9 Because of the number of programs and activities at issue in this appeal, we will not\n\nenumerate here each instance in which the district court based its ruling on a less than significant\n\nrisk of transmission. We offer, instead, three examples that demonstrate the court's failure to\n\nquantify and appropriately balance the risks in each prison program.\n\n        The district court's consideration of the first program is typical of its approach to many of\n\nthe challenged activities. Religious programs are held in the Tutwiler chapel, with inmates\n\nsupervised at all times by the chaplain or his assistants. Appellants argued at trial that the constant\n\nsupervision would prevent any unsafe behavior, as evidenced by the fact that there had been no\n\nincident reports of risky activity during chapel services. Further, they claimed that any remaining\n\nsafety risk could be rendered insignificant by requiring HIV+ inmates to sit apart from general\n\npopulation prisoners. The court concluded that appellants' evidence failed to prove them \"otherwise\n\nqualified\" because the lack of incident reports \"does not prove that potentially high risk behavior\n\n(e.g., passing needles or syringes) never occurred, only that it has not been discovered.\" Op. at 62.10\n\nIn addition, the district court opined that appellants' suggested accommodations did not aid their\n\ncase; the separate sitting arrangements do not guarantee that high-risk behavior will not occur, the\n\n\n   9\n    We are aware that the district court occasionally used the correct legal terminology, but we\nattach no importance to its choice of words because it is apparent that the court would find a\n\"significant\" risk even where it conceded none existed. Compare Op. at 155 (\"this Court holds\nthat integrating the out-of-the-prison programs would present a significant risk of transmitting\nthe deadly HIV virus\"), with id. at 152 (\"The probability that the HIV disease will be transmitted\nis not significant in the [out-of-the-prison] programs where inmates are supervised by\ncorrectional officers....\").\n   10\n   The court repeated this reasoning in its analysis of 27 of 79 programs it considered at\nLimestone and Tutwiler.\n\n                                                  13\n\fdistrict court reasoned, because the civilian supervisors have no authority to discipline prisoners if\n\nthey do not remain separate. Id. at 68.11 These observations, however, rested on conjecture. First,\n\nthe court assumed that inmates in the programs would possess needles or syringes. Second, it\n\nassumed that exchanges of such contraband occur but previously have been undetected. Third, it\n\nassumed that inmates would not obey the dictates of their civilian supervisors, even though civilian\n\npersonnel are instructed to report disciplinary incidents to prison officials. Notably absent was any\n\nattempt to determine whether or how often inmates have secreted contraband into prison programs,\n\nwhether or how often such contraband is able to be exchanged, and whether or how often such\n\nexchanges lead to high-risk activity. The district court created a scenario for transmission sufficient\n\nto satisfy an \"any risk\" standard by stringing its assumptions together, but failed to show that the\n\nscenario satisfies the governing significant transmission risk test.\n\n          Similarly, the district court held that DOC's exclusion of HIV+ inmates from maintenance\n\njobs at Tutwiler was justified. Although the prisoners are not supervised constantly, appellants\n\nargued that the prison job board only allows those inmates with appropriate behavioral histories to\n\nparticipate, thus minimizing the risk of high-risk behavior and, consequently, transmission. The\n\ndistrict court held that appellants are not \"otherwise qualified\" because \"[t]he risk of the job board's\n\nmaking an erroneous decision always exists,\" Op. at 211,12 and because even careful selection of\n\ninmates who do not misbehave would not prevent potentially HIV-transmitting fights between\nseropositive participants and others who oppose integration. Id. at 217.13 Again, the result reached\nby the court reveals the difference between an \"any risk\" standard and a \"significant risk\" standard.\n\nThe court merely speculated about the job board's fallibility without discussing the potential\n\n\n\n   11\n        This rationale appeared 23 times in the opinion.\n   12\n        The court discussed and dismissed the job board on twelve separate occasions in its opinion.\n\n   13\n     The court justified segregation based on the possibility of HIV transmission from fighting in\nsixteen different programs.\n\n                                                   14\n\ffrequency of such errors14 and assumed that inmate violence was likely to occur in the program.\n\nMoreover, although the district court conceded earlier in its opinion that the transmission risk from\n\nviolence is low, it nevertheless found appellants ineligible to participate. The district court's\n\ncombination of these factors may identify a conceivable pathway for transmission, but it does not\n\namount to the quantitative analysis necessary to find a significant risk.\n\n          The district court's willingness to hypothesize is best exemplified by its treatment of certain\n\nout-of-the-prison programs.15 Although inmates are supervised by corrections officers during such\n\nprograms and although the court conceded that \"[t]he probability that the HIV disease will be\n\ntransmitted is not significant\" in supervised programs, Op. at 152, the court nevertheless rejected\n\nappellants' claims that they were \"otherwise qualified.\" The court reasoned:\n\n          [I]n the prison system, one must always be prepared for the unexpected. An automobile or\n          other accident may incapacitate a guard and leave the inmates on the out-of-the-prison detail\n          free to proceed without an escort. An inmate, temporarily healthy but facing the bleak future\n          of all sero-positives, may have controlling impulses vastly different from those of healthy\n          inmates who may be more concerned about the penal aspects of their future.\n\n          ....\n\n          If ... a correctional officer has been incapacitated in an accident, a female inmate with\n          contempt for that officer could purposely implant, while the guard remains unconscious,\n          blood containing HIV organisms from the HIV+ inmate[']s open wounds.\n\nOp. at 153.16 Thus, the court found segregation justified even though the likelihood of transmission\n\nin these programs depends, in this rather fanciful hypothetical situation, upon the unlikely\ncoincidence of possibilities that an accident might occur, a guard might be wounded and rendered\n\nunconscious, and an HIV+ inmate might have both an open wound and a vendetta. It is exactly this\n\n\n\n\n   14\n    The court's speculation is especially inappropriate after it excluded evidence of the job\nboard's effectiveness. See infra section II.B.4.\n   15\n     Such programs include, for example, the Medium Custody Road Squad, in which inmates\nare supervised while cutting grass and picking up trash alongside roadways by an armed guard.\n   16\n        The court used this identical reasoning to reject integration in 6 separate programs.\n\n                                                    15\n\fkind of speculation that the significant transmission risk test guards against and that section 504\n\nprohibits.17\n\n        These examples are by no means exhaustive and should not be read to suggest that proper\n\napplication of the appropriate standard will necessitate seropositive inmates' participation in all (or\n\neven the preceding) programs. To the contrary, the court may find, upon appropriately quantifying\n\nthe risk inherent in certain activities, that integration is inappropriate. Appellants candidly admit,\n\nfor instance, that HIV+ prisoners might properly be excluded from \"runner jobs,\" in which inmates\n\nperform errands for DOC personnel and have tremendous access to various parts of the prison, often\n\nwithout supervision. Appellants' Reply Br. at 12. We only hold that the district court erroneously\n\nrequired appellants to disprove all conceivable (and even fanciful) risks of transmission, and that\n\nthis ruling requires remand for application of the proper standard.\n\n                                                  3.\n\n        Our conclusion that the district court imposed too strict a burden on appellants does not end\n\nthis case. Instead, we must address the court's alternative ruling that prisoners invoking section 504\n\nmust clear a hurdle that non-inmate plaintiffs need not. Specifically, the court held that inmates'\n\nstatutory rights under the Act may be subordinated to correctional concerns, just as some of their\n\nconstitutional rights may be.18 Under Turner v.

Because the district court found that\n\nthere was a likelihood of violence whenever HIV+ inmates are mixed with general population\n\nprisoners, it concluded that the Turner test rendered appellants not \"otherwise qualified.\"20 This\n\nholding is erroneous.\n\n          The district court's freedom to determine the applicable \"otherwise qualified\" standard was\n\nconstrained by the prior panel's remand. In setting out what appellants had to prove on remand, the\n\nprior panel discussed only the Arline test. Harris, 941 F.2d at 1525-27. Such silence is significant\n\nbecause the court was acutely aware of the Turner test. Immediately prior to discussing section 504,\n\nthe panel rejected appellants' constitutional right to privacy claim under Turner. Id. at 1512-21.\n\nCrucially, appellants' privacy claim attacked the same condition as their Rehabilitation Act\n\nclaim—their segregation. If both causes of action were subject to Turner, then, the court should\n\nhave rejected both upon determining that either failed the Turner test. Because the prior panel did\n\n\nCir.1996), the court cited Williams, without significant discussion, for the categorical proposition\nthat the Act \"does not apply to issues of prison employment.\"\n   19\n        Under Turner, several factors bear on a regulation's validity:\n\n                  (a) whether there is a \"valid, rational connection\" between the regulation and a\n                  legitimate government interest put forward to justify it; (b) whether there are\n                  alternative means of exercising the asserted constitutional right that remain open\n                  to the inmates; (c) whether and the extent to which accommodation of the\n                  asserted right will have an impact on prison staff, inmates and the allocation of\n                  prison resources generally; and (d) whether the regulation represents an\n                  \"exaggerated response\" to prison concerns.\n\n          Harris, 941 F.2d at 1516.\n   20\n     Turner was the sole ground on which the district court rejected appellants' participation in\ncertain programs. See, e.g., Op. at 369-76 (Limestone staff barber jobs). Usually, however, the\ncourt cited Turner as a justification for segregating HIV+ inmates after having found that they\ncould not satisfy Arline.\n\n                                                   17\n\fnot, we conclude that it ruled that the Arline test, unadorned by Turner, was applicable. On remand,\n\nthat standard was the law of the case.21\n\n        As the law of the case, the prior holding bound the district court \"unless the presentation of\n\nnew evidence or an intervening change in the controlling law dictate[d] a different result, or the\n\nappellate decision [was] clearly erroneous and, if implemented, would work a manifest injustice.\"\n\nLitman v.

Neither of these statements suggests that the Turner\ntest applies, nor are they inconsistent with applying section 504's test alone; consideration of\nprison needs is appropriate within the statutory framework because the Act's reasonable\naccommodation and undue burden inquiries are always contextual.

See Torcasio, 57\nF.3d at 1345. This reasoning, however, does not justify subjecting the Rehabilitation Act to\nTurner 's limits because we already have decided that the Rehabilitation Act applies to state\nprisons. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1522 n. 41; supra note 18. The dissent takes us to task for\n\"second-guessing the legitimate penological decisions of state authorities.\" Because such review\nof DOC's decisions has been legislatively mandated (or, to use the dissent's more innocuous\nphrase, \"statutorily prompted\") by section 504, however, our inquiry here does not \"run[ ]\nsquarely counter to the most basic notions of comity,\" but rather fulfills the role Congress has\ncreated for the courts.\n   24\n     The court in Lawson actually subjected the inmates' claim to the Turner test, but only\nbecause it determined that Congress so intended. The opinion clearly indicates, however, that\nCongress' intent, and not the simple fact of incarceration, determines the scope of inmates'\nstatutory rights.\n\n                                                  19\n\f       Thus, the district court erred by grafting Turner's constitutional standard onto this court's\n\nstated statutory test. We therefore hold that the district court's judgment cannot be affirmed based\n\nupon its alternative Turner rationale.\n\n                                                  4.\n\n        Appellants next assert that the district court prohibited them from proving that a reasonable\n\naccommodation exists that would make them \"otherwise qualified.\" Specifically, they object to the\n\ncourt's exclusion of evidence of DOC's ability to conduct, as a precondition to program participation,\n\nan individualized assessment of seropositive inmates' propensities to engage in high-risk activities.\n\nWe conclude that the district court erred.\n\n       On several occasions during trial, appellants sought to introduce evidence about the prison\n\nclassification process, but the district court prohibited them from doing so. For instance, appellants\n\nattempted to elicit testimony explaining Limestone's and Tutwiler's \"job boards\" and \"classification\n\nteams,\" which together gather psychological, penological, and behavioral data about all inmates and\n\nconsider such information in making program recommendations and assignments. The district court\n\nruled that, because this case was remanded for a program-by-program assessment of risk, see supra\n\nnote 5, it was precluded from considering evidence about DOC's ability to make, within programs,\n\ninmate-by-inmate determinations of eligibility. The district court therefore assumed that DOC's\n\ncapacity to select inmates who do not pose a significant risk of transmitting HIV was not relevant\nto the case on remand.\n\n       To the contrary, appellants' proffered evidence was central to the question before the district\n\ncourt. One of the things that appellants were required to prove on remand was that, if they could\n\nnot participate in prison programs safely under current conditions, there existed reasonable\n\naccommodations that would allow seropositive prisoners to be integrated safely. A mechanism\n\nwhereby those least likely to engage in high-risk behavior would be selected for a program may be\n\nan accommodation that could reduce the risk of transmission to an insignificant level in a particular\n\nprogram. Further, appellants offered to prove that such accommodation was reasonably affordable\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fand administratively feasible, also relevant to the court's reasonable accommodation determination,\n\nas DOC already classifies prisoners and recommends them for various programs based upon their\n\nindividual histories. Thus, the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence pertinent\n\nto a fundamental issue in the case.25\n\n        We do not lightly upset a district court's order based upon evidentiary error. Rather, \"[w]e\n\noverturn evidentiary rulings only when the moving party has proved a substantial prejudicial effect.\"\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 61; Judd v.

Specifically, the court refused to\n\nconsider appellants' potential integration into work release programs, correctional industries,\n\nresidential substance abuse programs, a sex offender treatment program, and boot camps.26\n\n   25\n     The district court impliedly recognized this error in its opinion by attempting to evaluate\nindividual assessment as a reasonable accommodation. The court then rejected such\naccommodation based upon the fallibility of the selection process. Its ruling, however, is tainted\nby the fact that it excluded evidence tending to shed light on the ability of DOC to predict\nhigh-risk behavior reliably.\n   26\n    The district court also ruled that it would not consider integrating HIV+ prisoners into\ngeneral population housing. Appellants objected to that decision, but did not raise it on appeal.\nWe deem the issue abandoned. See Greenbriar, Ltd. v.

The prior panel's remand was not so limited; it directed\n\nthe court to consider \"each program and activity from which HIV-positive prisoners are being\n\nexcluded....\" Harris, 941 F.2d at 1527. Indeed, the panel even mentioned work release as a program\n\nin which appellants have been denied participation. Id. at 1522 n. 40. In view of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct's expansive definition of \"program or activity,\" see 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1)(A) (holding that\n\n\"program or activity\" includes \"all of the operations\" of state agencies and departments receiving\n\nfederal funds), we agree with appellants that the off-site programs appear to have been a proper\n\nsubject for retrial.27 DOC responds that the prior panel ruled that segregated housing did not violate\n\nseropositive inmates' right to privacy and, because these off-site programs are residential in nature,\n\nimpliedly held that such activities fall outside of section 504. This argument proves too much; by\n\nfinding DOC's practices constitutional, this court did not conclude that they comported with section\n\n504. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for a remand to assess whether program\n\nsegregation violated the statute.28\n\n\n6 (1989).\n   27\n     See also 28 C.F.R. § 42.540 (\"program\" includes the operations of department of\ncorrections); Nondiscrimination Based on Handicap in Federally Assisted Programs, 45\nFed.Reg. 37,620, 37,630 (1980) (listing corrections agencies obligated to make, including\nstructural modifications to accommodate disabled persons, \"jails, prisons, reformatories and\ntraining schools, work camps, reception and diagnostic centers, pre-release and work-release\nfacilities, and community-based facilities\").\n   28\n     In rejecting appellants' argument, the district court also relied in part on the fact that, under\nMeachum v.

We express no opinion\n\non that subject, especially given the emptiness of the record regarding such activities.

The district court, however, rejected\n\nappellants' argument that DOC should add staff as an accommodation. Because DOC does not\n\nreceive from the Alabama legislature all of the funds it requests and because its funding had, at the\n\ntime of trial, recently been reduced, the district court found that the addition of even a single\n\ncorrections officer to integrate HIV+ inmates into certain programs would impose an undue burden\n\nupon DOC.

This DOC has not done. That DOC receives fewer funds than it requests or that it has fewer\n\nofficers than it would like says nothing about its ability to hire a single officer within its current\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fbudget. Trial evidence indicated that DOC has tremendous spending discretion within its budget\n\nand can request necessary additional funds from the legislature. Additionally, a defense witness\n\nconceded that DOC would save money if it were to discontinue some of the \"separate but equal\"\n\nprograms currently operated for seropositive prisoners. Such funds presumably could finance an\n\nadditional guard to facilitate integration.\n\n        We therefore conclude that, based upon the evidence before it, the district court clearly erred\n\nin finding that any expenditure by DOC to hire additional staff would be an \"undue burden.\" We\n\nleave open on remand the possibility that sufficient evidence may be adduced as to the\n\nunreasonableness of adding even a single guard, but note that DOC must show that such an\n\naccommodation would be unreasonable given the demands of its present budget. See 28 C.F.R. §\n\n42.511(c) (stating that undue hardship inquiry should consider \"(1) [t]he overall size of the\n\nrecipient's program with respect to number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of\n\nbudget; (2)[t]he type of the recipient's operation, including the composition and structure of the\n\nrecipient's workforce; and (3)[t]he nature and cost of the accommodation needed\").29\n\n                                                  C.\n\n        To summarize, we hold that the district court correctly allocated the burdens of persuasion\n\nat trial. We vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings, however,\n\nbecause the district court determined that appellants were not \"otherwise qualified\" based upon two\nerrors of law: (1) the court required appellants to disprove all conceivable risks of transmission in\n\nprison programs, even though the statute requires only the elimination of significant risks; and (2)\n\nthe court disqualified appellants from programs in which penological interests, such as eliminating\n\ncompletely the potential for inmate violence, purportedly justified segregation. On remand, the\n\ndistrict court must reassess whether appellants are \"otherwise qualified\" in light of our decision.\n\nMoreover, the court should consider evidence that demonstrates DOC's ability to integrate programs\n\n   29\n    Although this provision is located in a section of the Department of Justice's Rehabilitation\nAct regulations titled \"Employment\", the first and third factors it suggests are equally relevant to\nevaluating whether an accommodation would be an undue burden in a non-employment case.\n\n                                                  24\n\fby selecting only those individuals unlikely to engage in high-risk behavior. The court also must\n\nexamine the possibility of integrating the off-site programs discussed in section II.B.5. Finally, the\n\ncourt should not find that DOC has satisfied its burden of proving that suggested accommodations\n\nare unreasonable simply upon a showing that DOC receives less than its requested level of funding\n\nfrom the state or upon a showing that DOC has fewer officers than it would like.30\n\n                                                 III.\n\n        Near the beginning of trial on remand, appellants moved to recuse Judge Varner from\n\nhearing the case. They appeal the district court's denial of that motion, claiming that recusal was\n\nrequired because the son of DOC's lead counsel is Judge Varner's law clerk and because Judge\n\nVarner revealed that he discussed the case with his son, a doctor, who expressed his view that there\n\nwas a risk of HIV transmission in some of the programs at issue on retrial. We review the judge's\n\nrecusal ruling for an abuse of discretion. Loranger v.

On\n\nappeal, appellants forward an additional ground for disqualification; they claim that the judge's trial\n\ncomments evinced a pervasive hostility toward the members of the appellant class. We are\n\nconcerned by the allegation that the judge and his son discussed disputed matters, but avoid deciding\n\nwhether recusal was necessary. The remaining allegations are not disqualifying.\n\n        The relevant provisions of the recusal statute read as follows:\n\n        (a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any\n        proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\n\n        (b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:\n\n\n\n   30\n     We do not reach several issues argued on appeal. First, DOC contends that it may face\nliability in suits by prisoners and the public if programs are integrated and innocents are infected.\nSecond, appellants challenge several of the district court's factual findings, including its reliance\non the \"Ingram Study,\" an inmate opinion survey purporting to show an increased likelihood of\nviolence after integration, and its conclusion that certain behavior (sex between women,, sports,\nfighting, and sharing barbering equipment) posed a high risk of HIV transmission. Third, DOC\nsuggests that the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626, limits appellants' ability to\nsecure sweeping injunctive relief. On remand, the district court is free to examine these issues'\nbearing on the merits of appellants' claims and, if appropriate, on the necessity and scope of\nrelief.\n\n                                                  25\n\f                (1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal\n                knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding....\n\n28 U.S.C. § 455. Appellants argue that Judge Varner's trial comments and the hiring of DOC's\n\ncounsel's son create a reasonable question about the judge's partiality under section 455(a) and that\n\nJudge Varner's discussion with his son gave him knowledge of disputed facts in violation of section\n\n455(b)(1). In the alternative, appellants claim that all of these facts considered together would lead\n\na reasonable person to question the judge's impartiality. See Parker v.

It is true that a law clerk's involvement in a case and his or\n\nher relationship to one of the parties may constitute grounds for the judge's disqualification. See,\n\ne.g., Parker, 855 F.2d at 1524-25 (recusal was required where judge's clerk was son of senior partner\n\nin firm representing party, the father was himself a former law clerk to the judge, the son held a\n\nhearing with the parties present but not the judge, and the judge thanked the law clerk in his order\n\nfor the clerk's extensive work on the case).\n\n        Law clerk conflicts, however, are not necessarily judicial conflicts, and we conclude that\n\nJudge Varner did not abuse his discretion in denying disqualification on this ground. The court\n\nstated unequivocally in its order that the clerk had no involvement in this case, and the clerk's father\n\nsubmitted an affidavit representing that he instructed his son not to take any action with regard to\n\nthe suit. These averments satisfy us that disqualification was not required.

DOC contends\n\n\n\nthe court merely inquired about the phrase \"will cause varying degrees of harm.\" We do not\nnecessarily agree with the court's view of this snippet of Arline (as the balancing test already\naccounts for \"the severity of the risk\"), but appellants unfairly take the court's legal inquiry out\nof context.\n\n                                                   27\n\fthat the discussion in chambers concerned the issue of how HIV can be transmitted, that Judge\n\nVarner expressed his view that the medical community was divided on the issue, and that Judge\n\nVarner also mentioned his son's illegible handwriting, but that the latter statement was unconnected\n\nto the prior discussion about issues for trial. Id. For his part, Judge Varner did not deny that the\n\nconversation took place, nor did he dispute appellants' characterization of the substance of the\n\ndiscussion. Instead, the court held that the conversation could not form the basis for recusal because\n\nof the court's conclusion that the reported statements were not disputed in the case; the court then\n\nquoted portions of this court's prior opinion acknowledging that the risk of HIV transmission exists\n\nin prisons generally.

In response to the district court's blanket\n\nconclusion after the original trial that appellants were not \"otherwise qualified\" because high-risk\n\nbehavior occurs in prisons, the prior panel directed the district court to examine each challenged\n\nprogram, stating that \"general findings and prison policy\" could not justify segregation. Harris, 941\n\nF.2d at 1527. Nevertheless, on remand, the district court relied heavily on generalization and\n\ndeference to prison policy in rejecting appellants' claims. In each program for which the court\n\ndetermined that appellants were not \"otherwise qualified,\" it found that high-risk behavior and\n\nviolence against seropositive inmates were likely because they occur in prisons generally.32 Further,\n\n\n\n\n   32\n     Specifically, the district court selected segments of this court's prior opinion—wherein the\npanel observed that \"the elimination of high risk behavior ... is impossible,\" id. at 1520, and that\ntotal integration of the prison \"could likely degenerate into active violence,\" id. at 1518—and\nthen stated that there is no reason to believe that these general observations about prison are not\nalso true of specific programs. The court repeated these end-runs around the prior panel's\nremand in discussing no less than 39 of 43 programs at Tutwiler.\n\n                                                  29\n\fthe court gave unbridled deference to the decisions of prison officials, repeating the following\n\nstatement either verbatim or in substance in its analysis of nearly every challenged program:\n\n        This Court is ill-suited to instruct prison officials on the likelihood of the occurrence of high\n        risk behavior. This Court is even more ill-suited to instruct the prison system on when and\n        how to prevent such conduct when they [sic], along with their managers and medical\n        officials, determine that such conduct is likely. Because Defendant/Prison system has\n        decided that such conduct is likely, and because of the catastrophic severity of the\n        consequences if such conduct does occur, this Court holds that integrating [the specific\n        program] would present a significant risk of transmitting the deadly HIV virus.\n\nOp. at 63; see also passim. The district court's deference to policy makers, however, led it to\n\nabandon its judicial role. See, e.g., id. at 461 (\"Regardless of how much evidence is presented, no\n\ncourt will ever be as qualified as prison officials to judge the particular needs of a penal institution.\")\n\n(emphasis added).33\n\n        Reassignment is also necessary to preserve the appearance of justice. First, we believe that\n\nreasonable people would be troubled by the judge's alleged conversation with his doctor-son about\n\nthe case and about disputed evidence in addition to the court's unwillingness to forego\n\ngeneralizations about prison in analyzing particular programs. Although we lack sufficient evidence\n\nto conclude that the discussion mandated recusal, we are convinced that the situation is questionable\n\nenough to warrant reassignment. Second, the court brushed aside both precedent, see supra note 6,\n\nas well as the prior panel's remand, see supra sections II.B.3. & 5, to rule against appellants.\n\nFinally, appellants' other grounds for disqualification, although alone insufficient to mandate recusal,\nadd to the totality of the circumstances and increase the appearance of injustice.\n\n        We are not unmindful that this case is substantial, having spawned a voluminous record and\n\nhaving been litigated for nearly ten years. At the same time, however, we note that the first appeal\n\nof this case disposed of all but one of appellants' constitutional claims, and appellants have not now\n\nappealed the second denial of the remaining claim.                 Thus, the only issue left is the\n\nprogram-by-program analysis under section 504. This will surely involve additional fact finding,\n\n\n   33\n     The court also imposed the Turner test upon appellants' prima facie case, thereby giving\nprison officials added deference. See supra section II.B.3.\n\n                                                    30\n\fbut we are convinced that this additional burden is outweighed by the needs of justice and by\n\nCongress' broad mandate that \"[n]o otherwise qualified handicapped individual ... shall, solely by\n\nreason of his handicap, ... be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving\n\nFederal financial assistance....\" 28 U.S.C. § 794.\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n        Accordingly, the decision of the district court is VACATED. We REMAND for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion and with the direction to the Chief Judge of the Middle\n\nDistrict of Alabama that the case be REASSIGNED to a different district judge for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n        COX, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n        I respectfully disagree with the majority's resolution of five of the issues addressed in its\n\nopinion. First, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 does not require federal-fund grantees and\n\ntheir wards to live with even slight odds of contracting a painful and fatal disease. Second,\n\nprisoners' rights under the Rehabilitation Act, like their constitutional rights, are properly limited\n\nby legitimate penological concerns such as security. Third, the district court correctly concluded\n\nthat providing the additional security necessary to integrate the plaintiffs in all the programs at issue\n\nhere would be an undue burden on the Department of Corrections. Fourth, the district court should\n\nnot be mandated to consider programs requiring residential integration when—as the majority\nfound—the plaintiffs have waived the argument that the district court should have addressed their\n\nrights to residential integration. I would accordingly find no error in the district court's treatment\n\nof these issues. Finally, this action does not merit the extreme measure of reassignment to another\n\ndistrict judge. I agree, however, with the majority's holding that the district court's exclusion of\n\nevidence of prisoner classification as a reasonable accommodation requires remand.1 Thus, I would\n\nvacate the judgment and remand solely for the district court to reconsider whether inmate-specific\n\n\n\n   1\n    See part II.B.4 of the majority opinion.\n\n                                                   31\n\frisk evaluation is a reasonable accommodation in light of the excluded evidence concerning inmate\n\nclassification.\n\n                                              I. Background\n\n          This litigation began ten years ago in reaction to a legislatively mandated AIDS-protection\n\nprogram in Alabama's prison system. Under statute,2 the Alabama prison system tests all entering\n\ninmates for infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which causes AIDS.3 Those\n\ninmates testing positive for the virus are segregated from the general inmate population in \"HIV+\"\n\nunits, one for men at the Limestone Correctional Facility and one for women at the Julia Tutwiler\n\nPrison for Women.4 So segregated, the HIV-positive inmates are unable to participate in many\n\nprograms and activities with the HIV-negative, general population.5\n\n          The plaintiff class challenged this practice as a violation of several constitutional rights and\n\nof § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.6 The district court denied relief after a bench trial. The\n\ncourt concluded that no constitutional rights were violated. It further concluded that the plaintiffs\n\nwere not \"otherwise qualified,\" as required for rights to arise under § 504, to participate in integrated\n\nprograms because their participation would pose a significant HIV-transmission risk. This court\n\naffirmed judgment against the plaintiffs on the constitutional claims. This court held, however, that\n\n§ 504 requires a program-by-program analysis to determine if the plaintiffs merit relief.7 The action\n\nwas remanded to the district court for this fact-finding. This court directed the district court\nespecially to evaluate the risk of HIV transmission in each program. In doing so, the panel\n\n\n\n   2\n    Ala.Code § 22-11A-17(a) (1996 Supp.)\n   3\n    Harris v.

Several key facts are undisputed. In the current state of medical knowledge and art, HIV\n\ninfection inevitably progresses to AIDS. AIDS always leads to death, often after lengthy suffering.\n\nThere is likewise no dispute that HIV is transmitted through body fluids, and that transmission by\n\nblood is much more probable than transmission by any other means. The primary disputed issue is\n\nthe likelihood of blood-to-blood contact between HIV-positive and HIV-negative inmates during\n\nthe various programs in which the plaintiffs seek to participate.\n\n          The defendants presented evidence that transmission is possible in any integrated activity.\n\nThey did this in two ways. First, the defendants showed that certain activities inherently raise the\n\npossibility of blood transmission.9 Second, the defendants adduced evidence that high-risk behavior\n\n(such as anal intercourse, sharing of drug needles,10 or tattooing11) or behavior that presents the\n\npossibility of transmission (such as violent bloodshed) may occur in virtually any activity in which\n\nHIV-positive and HIV-negative prisoners mingle without supervision.12 This evidence included\n\ntestimony about and numerous incident reports of high-risk behavior in a variety of settings, from\n\n\n\n\n   8\n    Id. at 1526.\n   9\n   See, e.g., Onishea v. Herring, No. 87V-1109-N, at 31 (M.D.Ala. Dec. 29, 1995) [hereinafter\nOp.]; R.29 at 158 (barbering with unsterilized razors); Op. at 32; R.29 at 167 (sports).\n   10\n    The parties agreed that anal intercourse and sharing hypodermic needles are high-risk\nbehaviors. Op. at 27.\n   11\n        R.29 at 32.\n   12\n     See, e.g., R.29 at 145-46 (\"possibility\" exists during anger-management and\nsubstance-abuse therapy for both violent and needle-sharing behavior); id. at 179 (\"opportunity\"\nexists during data processing classes at Tutwiler for needle-sharing); id. at 177-78 (large size of\nclass and individual attention makes high-risk behavior possible in cosmetology class at\nTutwiler).\n\n                                                  33\n\fbathrooms to the kitchen to the library.13 Defense witnesses provided anecdotal evidence that even\n\nprisoners with strong incentives to behave have nonetheless run risks.14 The defense case also\n\ncontained evidence that HIV-negative prisoners will not easily tolerate integration. This evidence\n\nincluded a 1988 study of Alabama prisoners concluding that HIV-negative inmates may react\n\nviolently to integration15 and corroborating anecdotal evidence.16 Finally, the defendants presented\n\ncircumstantial evidence that Alabama's total segregation policy, one of only two in the nation, is\n\nsuperior to integrated programs in slowing HIV's spread. The all-time seroconversion rate per\n\nthousand prisoners in Alabama's prisons is .00006%, as compared to annual rates of .19, .33, and\n\n.41% in Nevada, Illinois, and Maryland, respectively, all states with integrated populations.17\n\n          The plaintiffs naturally took a different tack. While never categorically denying the\n\npossibility of transmission if a bloody fight breaks out, tattoo needles are shared, sports injuries\n\noccur, or female inmates have sex with each other, they marshaled evidence of the rarity or absence\n\nof any such incidents of transmission.18 They further presented evidence that there are no reported\n\nor witnessed incidents of anal sex, needle-sharing, or other high-risk behavior during any of the\n\nactivities in which they wish to participate.19 The plaintiffs also offered evidence that the degree of\n\n   13\n    See, e.g., R.32 at 191 (syringes smuggled into Limestone wrapped in Kotex pads); Defs.'\nExs. F-5 (needles hidden in library), F-7 (syringe in public bathroom), F-20 (unspecified\nhomosexual act in kitchen over a mixing bowl of peanut butter and jelly).\n   14\n    See R.32 at 295 (runner—who as such held a coveted job among the prisoners—engaged in\nhigh-risk behavior in the HIV unit at Limestone).\n   15\n        See R.36 at 142-43.\n   16\n   For instance, HIV-negative prisoners refused to use the same drafting tools as the\nHIV-positive inmates, for fear of contracting HIV. R.27 at 228.\n   17\n        Op. at 462.\n   18\n     See, e.g., R.27 at 35 (no documented cases of transmission through stabbing); id. at 43-44\n(never a reported incident of transmission via tattoo needles); id. at 36-39 (no confirmed cases\nof sports-related transmission); id. at 18 (only theoretical cases of sexual transmission between\nwomen have been described).\n   19\n     See, e.g., R.25 at 76-77 (no sex or needle-sharing incidents reported in cosmetology class,\njust fistfights); id. at 110 (no incidents except fistfights in sewing factory at Tutwiler); R.32 at\n\n                                                  34\n\fsurveillance in most circumstances makes such behavior implausible. Moreover, the plaintiffs'\n\nanecdotal evidence is that HIV-positive and HIV-negative prisoners in both Limestone and Tutwiler\n\nhave mingled peacefully and without HIV transmission in \"welfare committee\" meetings,20 fire\n\ndrills,21 \"Communicators' Meetings,\"22 and literacy training classes23.\n\n          Based on this record, the parties' approach to measuring the odds of transmission is\n\npredictable. On one hand, the defendants contend that transmission could happen whenever\n\nprisoners mix because of the perpetual potential for high-risk activity or for violence—and the\n\nHIV-negative prisoners' anti-HIV sentiments boost the odds of confrontation and bloodshed.\n\nHIV-positive participation in any of the programs, according to the defendants, thus poses a\n\nsignificant risk of transmission. On the other hand, the plaintiffs argue that none of the defendants'\n\nchthonic scenarios has ever been realized in prison history, and that the defendants' fear of clashes\n\nbetween HIV-positive and HIV-negative inmates is unwarranted in today's enlightened prison\n\nsociety.\n\n          The district court generally took the defendants' view, concluding that the risk of\n\ntransmission in every program was significant. While the court's reasoning was not wholly uniform\n\nfor every program, the court generally reached this result by measuring the odds based on two\n\nbackground findings, rather than extrapolating past incidents of transmission. The first finding is\n\n\n\n258 (no incidents among inmate maintenance workers at Limestone); id. at 251 (no incidents\namong tractor crew at Limestone); id. at 247-48 (no incidents on the \"double-O squad,\" which\nmaintains the prison grounds); id. at 244 (no incidents in \"college by cassette\" classes); id. at\n245 (no disciplinary incidents in the paralegal classes); id. at 246-47 (no incidents at GED and\ncollege graduation ceremonies); R.25 at 205 (no incidents in substance abuse treatment classes).\n\n   20\n        R.28 at 94.\n   21\n        R.33 at 26-27.\n   22\n     Id. at 28-29. On the other hand, one of the plaintiffs' experts also opined that \"there has to\nbe an unlearning process\" at both Tutwiler and Limestone, and that certain activities such as\ndining should therefore not be immediately integrated. See R.25 at 93.\n   23\n        R.33 at 210-12.\n\n                                                 35\n\fthat sex, intravenous drug use, and bloodshed are a perpetual possibility in prison whenever a\n\nsecurity guard trained to stop it is not watching, and that prison life is inherently\n\nunpredictable24—especially when large-scale mixing of HIV-positive and HIV-negative prisoners\n\nin Alabama is untried. The second finding is that HIV is transmitted by sex, intravenous drug use,\n\nand blood-to-blood contact. If these activities can spread HIV, and these activities can occur\n\nbetween HIV-positive and HIV-negative inmates, the court reasoned, then HIV transmission is more\n\nthan a theoretical possibility, even if we have no examples.25\n\n           From this conclusion, the court easily found this risk to be significant. After all, each case\n\nof transmission, however rare, claims at least one life. More lives could follow if the infected\n\ngeneral-population inmate spreads the virus to his dormmates. To support this inference of harm,\n\nthe court pointed to an investigation of a 1991 syphilis outbreak at Limestone in which medical\n\nofficials located 86 prisoners suspected of sexual contact with a single infected inmate.26 Given this\n\ndegree of harm, even slim odds of transmission make the risk significant. As the court put it in\n\nwords echoed throughout its 475-page opinion, \"elimination of high risk behavior is impossible....\n\nBecause the Defendant/Prison system has decided that such conduct is likely, and because of the\n\ncatastrophic severity of the consequences if such conduct does occur, this Court holds that\n\nintegrating the [program under discussion] would present a significant risk of transmitting the deadly\n\nHIV virus. Accordingly, the HIV+ inmates are not \"otherwise qualified.' \"27\n           The court took this otherwise-qualified analysis one step further. As part of its evaluation\n\nof the plaintiffs' qualifications to participate in the programs, it weighed the Department of\n\nCorrection's penological concerns, including the danger of violence that might arise from inmate\n\n\n\n   24\n        See, e.g., Op. at 211.\n   25\n        See id. at 48.\n   26\n        Op. at 464.\n   27\n        Id. at 313-314 (emphasis added); accord, e.g., id. at 82, 277-78.\n\n                                                    36\n\fprejudice toward and fear of HIV-positive prisoners.28 The court looked to Turner v. Safley, which\n\npermits infringement of prisoners' First Amendment rights provided that the prison regulation \"is\n\nreasonably related to a legitimate penological interest,\"29 as a guide to evaluating the Department\n\nof Corrections's interests. In almost every program, the court concluded that the Department of\n\nCorrections could legitimately seek to prevent violence and epidemic HIV by the measures it has\n\ntaken.\n\n           The court continued its analysis, as directed by this court,30 by asking if reasonable\n\naccommodations would make the plaintiffs qualified. Although the court found that in many\n\nprograms the plaintiffs had already been reasonably accommodated by provision of identical, but\n\nsegregated programs,31 the court found as to other programs that the only effective accommodation\n\nwould be additional guards to prevent high-risk behavior. The court concluded, however, that hiring\n\nthe dozens of guards necessary to integrate all the programs safely would place an undue financial\n\nburden on the Department of Corrections.\n\n           The plaintiffs have attacked every step of the analysis. On the \"otherwise qualified\" issue,\n\nthey contend that the district court weighed too heavily the gravity of the harm that could result if\n\nthese small risks are realized, and that the district court improperly took legitimate penological\n\nobjectives into account. Furthermore, they argue that the district court erroneously considered the\n\nburden on the Department of Corrections of accommodating all of the plaintiffs' demands, rather\n\n   28\n        Id. at 15-16.\n   29\n        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because none\n\nof these circumstances warrant recusal, I concur in the majority's conclusion on this issue. I would\n\nrefuse, however, to undermine that conclusion by reassigning the action based on the very same\n\nfacts.\n\n                                              II.

I would therefore remand for the limited purpose of permitting the district\ncourt to revisit its reasonable accommodations analysis in light of that evidence and any\ncounterevidence the defendants may choose to offer.\n\n                                                     38\n\fand erroneously found on the last step that the plaintiffs' proposed reasonable accommodations,\n\nconsidered together rather than program by program, are unduly burdensome.\n\n          The majority's first holding requires courts to treat all transmissible illnesses equally,\n\nregardless of their consequences; this does not comport with the law. The second holding requires\n\ncourts to apply identical standards to classrooms, workplaces, and prisons, and thus does not observe\n\nboth the unique importance of security in the prison environment and limited judicial competence\n\nin the penal realm. Finally, the majority's third holding fails to focus the undue burden analysis on\n\nthe unique circumstances of a case—which here means a case in which dozens of correctional\n\nofficers would be needed to accommodate the plaintiffs in all programs, even if one officer would\n\nreasonably accommodate them in one.34\n\n                                A. \"Significant Risk,\" Not \"High Odds\"\n\n          Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,35 under which the plaintiffs seek relief,\n\nrequires a federal-fund grantee reasonably to accommodate a disability only if the disabled person\n\nis \"otherwise qualified\" for the activity.36 As the Supreme Court interpreted the statute in School\n\nBoard v.

The plaintiffs\nclaim that the district court erroneously refused to consider programs such as work release and\nboot camp that required residential integration of the plaintiffs into the general population at\nother facilities. The majority notes correctly that the plaintiffs waived all claims for residential\nintegration by not challenging on appeal the trial court's refusal to consider the issue of\nintegration. Because the plaintiffs have abandoned on appeal any claim for residential\nintegration, this court should not direct the district court—in effect end-running the waiver—to\nconsider all programs requiring residential integration. The court should instead, in light of the\nwaiver, uphold the district court's refusal to consider those programs.\n   35\n        Codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. § 794 (1994).\n   36\n        Harris v.

Arline\n\n's selection of factors and its language show that the significance of a risk is a product of the odds\n\nthat transmission will occur and the severity of the consequences. First, Arline 's four factors include\n\nboth \"the severity of the risk\" and the \"the probabilities the disease will be transmitted,\" not just \"the\n\nodds the virus will spread.\" This suggests that each must interplay with the other in the\n\notherwise-qualified inquiry. Second, significance by itself connotes more than size: \"significant\"\n\nmeans \"deserving to be considered,\" \"important,\" \"weighty,\" or \"notable.\"41 It does not just mean\n\n\"big.\"42 And it is the potential gravity of the harm that imbues certain odds of an event with\n\nsignificance. This is indeed common sense: to borrow an analogy from the district court's opinion,\n\nwe are far more likely to consider walking a tightrope to pose a significant risk if the rope is fifty\n\nfeet high than if it is one foot off the ground. This is so even if the odds of losing our balance are\n\nthe same however far we have to fall.\n              In the context of HIV transmission, Arline 's standard thus means that something less than\n\nhigh odds of transmission will make the plaintiffs not otherwise qualified.                   It has been\n\n   38\n        Id. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 (quoting Br. for American Med.

These\n\nhorrendous consequences render even very low odds of transmission enough to make a risk\n\nsignificant. The other circuits that have confronted this issue directly have indeed so interpreted\n\nArline 's standard. The Fourth Circuit has affirmed a district court's conclusion that an HIV-positive\n\nneurosurgery resident could be barred from surgery, notwithstanding the fact that there were no\n\ndocumented cases of surgeon-to-patient HIV transmittal.43 Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has held that\n\na \"small\" chance of blood-to-blood contact between an HIV-positive surgical assistant and his\n\npatients nonetheless constitutes a \"significant\" risk: \"A cognizable risk of permanent duration with\n\nlethal consequences suffices\" to disqualify the assistant.44\n\n        Based on Arline 's standard thus interpreted, the district court's conclusion was correct. First,\n\nthe district court finding of a cognizable possibility of transmission has record support. The court\n\nfound as fact the following: that blood-to-blood contact likely transmits HIV; that violence,\n\nintravenous drug use, and sex may cause blood contact and occur in prisons in the most unlikely and\n\nunexpected places; and that it is impossible to know or surveil much of what goes on. These\n\nsubsidiary findings, which are supported by expert and lay testimony, legitimately support the\n\nconclusion that mixing prisoners raises a cognizable possibility of spreading HIV. \"Conjecture,\" as\n\n\n   43\n    Doe v.

Unlike here, the\ndistrict court in that action did not even consider certain transmission risks, such as through\nblood. Instead, the district court found that there was a \"remote theoretical possibility\" of\ntransmission through other bodily fluids and ended the inquiry there. Id. This court held that the\nrisks of transmission through tears, saliva, and urine in the case's classroom setting did not reach\na significant level of risk, but the court remanded for further findings as to the possibility of\nblood transmission.

After all, Arline\n\n's standard requires the court to measure risk. Measuring risk is predicting the future. Unless the\n\njudge is a seer, he must predict the future by drawing inferences from both current conditions and\n\npast events. It may be preferable to extrapolate past events, but in this case that would, in effect,\n\nimpose a somebody-has-to-die-first standard—the risk is not cognizable until someone dies from\n\nthe conditions posing the risk. This court should reject such a standard.\n\n          Next, the district court properly concluded that this risk was significant.             Arline 's\n\nsliding-scale standard authorized the court to cleave to caution and find the risk significant in a case\n\nsuch as this when death is a certain result of the possible event. The district court's conclusion also\n\ncomported with Arline in another significant respect: Arline urges circumspection when a finding\n\nmay contravene the judgment of public health professionals.45 Prison officials charged with\n\nprotecting prisoners' health have determined that this policy is justified, and the court properly\n\nhesitated before rejecting their judgment. The district court's conclusion that the plaintiffs'\n\nparticipation in the programs poses a significant risk to others' health, and that the plaintiffs thus are\n\nnot otherwise qualified, should be upheld.\n\n                                           B.

Many panels so\n\ndecide.55 Furthermore, whether Turner 's factors may weigh into otherwise-qualified analysis was\n\nnot an issue the court had to resolve before holding that the Rehabilitation Act requires a\n\nprogram-by-program qualifications assessment. There is, therefore, no law of the case relating to\n\nthis issue.\n\n          The issue is accordingly now before this court. This court should hold, as the Ninth Circuit\n\nhas,56 that Turner 's factors are relevant to Rehabilitation Act claims arising in prison. Four reasons\n\nsupport this conclusion.

In both cases, the\n\njudges run into the same problems of lack of experience and expertise when they begin to interfere\n\nwith matters traditionally left to the legislative and executive branches. Here, moreover, Congress's\n\nenactment of the statute does not put a legislative stamp of approval on judicial intrusion into state\n\nprison administration. Congress apparently never thought about prisons when it passed the\n\nRehabilitation Act. The words \"prison\" and \"prisoner\" do not occur in the legislative history.\n\nSection 504 does not mention prisons. In short, \"[t]here is no indication that Congress intended the\n\nAct to apply to prison facilities irrespective of the considerations of the reasonable requirements of\n\neffective prison administration.\"58\n\n          Second, federal judicial second-guessing of the legitimate penological decisions of state\n\nauthorities, even when statutorily prompted, runs squarely counter to the most basic notions of\n\ncomity. Prison administration is a core state function.59 \"It is difficult to imagine an activity in\n\nwhich a State has a stronger interest, or one that is more intricately bound up with state laws,\n\nregulations, and procedures, than the administration of its prisons.\"60 In this realm, federal courts\n\nshould await a clear statement from Congress before construing statutes as a license to dictate state\n\npolicy.61 Taking the Rehabilitation Act's silence as to application in the prison environment to mean\n\nthat its effect in prison is identical to that elsewhere does not comport with this \"clear statement\"\n\nrule.

The Fourth Circuit has indeed held that the\nRehabilitation Act does not apply to state prisons at all because of the Act's lack of an\nappropriate \"clear statement.\" Amos v. Maryland Dep't of Pub. Safety & Correctional Servs., 7\nA.D. Cases 454 (4th Cir.1997). While the applicability of the Rehabilitation Act to state prisons\nis law of the case for this panel, the issue may merit en banc attention.\n\n                                                 45\n\ffactors, which carry an element of deference to prison authorities, provides a means of avoiding\n\nundue interference in state affairs without a clear congressional direction.\n\n          Third, Arline 's standard, born in an action by a teacher plaintiff, is inadequate for the prison\n\nsetting. While Arline acknowledges that the Rehabilitation Act does not require the federal-fund\n\ngrantee, or its wards, to run significant risks of any kind,62 its rule views those risks as solely ones\n\nto health from the disease. In a classroom setting, or in the surgical theater,63 these risks may be the\n\nonly dangers that the communicable disease poses. But in prison, mixing carriers of a virus that is\n\nconsidered loathsome, however wrongly, with those who do not have the virus runs the risk of\n\nviolence. The district court so found, and cases elsewhere show that such violence is not unknown.64\n\nThis danger—whether or not it leads to HIV transmission—warrants consideration along with health\n\nrisks, and Turner 's factors offer a vehicle for taking into account hazards that are unique to the\n\nprison context.\n\n          Fourth, considering Turner 's factors in a prison Rehabilitation Act case is wholly consistent\n\nwith the statute. As Arline 's holding makes clear, § 504 does not command the federal-fund grantee\n\nto endanger its wards.65 And in the employment context from which Arline sprang, Congress has\n\nembraced the principle of safety-threat limitations. This concern for safety enters into § 504 by way\n\n\n   62\n     Arline, 480 U.S. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1130-31 (describing the inquiry under its standard as\n\"essential if § 504 is to achieve its goal of protecting handicapped individuals from deprivations\nbased on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to such\nlegitimate concerns of grantees as avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety\nrisks\") (emphasis added).\n   63\n    See Doe v.

Turner 's factors\n\noffer a means to implement these safety limitations in the prison setting.\n\n          For these reasons, the district court did not err in taking into account the defendants' security\n\nconcerns that lead to segregating the HIV-positive prisoners in the programs at issue. Nor did the\n\ndistrict court err in its analysis of Turner 's factors.69 A key fact-finding, which was adequately\n\nbased on survey evidence and the presence of an intervenor inmate class that opposes integration\n\nof the programs, is that there are still many inmates who would react negatively—indeed,\n\nviolently—to integration. Application of Turner 's four factors to this case's circumstances in light\n\nof this fact supports the district court's conclusion that security concerns disqualify the plaintiffs.\n\nFirst, security is a classically legitimate penological concern, and the court could conclude that\n\nseparating prisoners who, if mixed, would react violently, has a rational connection to preventing\n\nviolence. This factor weighs against the plaintiffs. Turner 's second factor weighs in the plaintiffs'\nfavor: they have no other way of participating in integrated programs. The third factor, however,\n\nweighs heavily against the plaintiffs; the district court could properly conclude, based on sufficient\n\nevidence of inmate prejudice, that mixing HIV-positive and HIV-negative inmates could cause\n\nripple effects that threatened security, either because of anti-HIV prejudice or as a result of the\n\n   66\n        29 U.S.C. § 794(d) (1994).\n   67\n        Codified at 42 U.S.C. § 12113(b) (1994).\n   68\n        Id.; see E.E.O.C. v.

Finally, the\n\ncourt properly concluded that there are no \"obvious, easy alternatives\" here: plaintiffs' implication\n\nthat integration is an easy alternative because other prison facilities follow it does not undermine the\n\ncourt's conclusion. Given its findings concerning the substantially higher seroconversion rates and\n\nincidence of violence elsewhere, the court could properly find that integration elsewhere served the\n\ninterests of security and health less reasonably than the policies under attack here. Thus, the district\n\ncourt's otherwise-qualified findings should be upheld.\n\n                         C. Isolated Versus Global Burden of Accommodation\n\n           The Rehabilitation Act deems a disabled person qualified to participate in an activity if\n\nreasonable accommodations remove any disqualification.70               One of the plaintiffs' primary\n\nreasonable-accommodation suggestions was the hiring of more guards to provide the surveillance\n\nnecessary to prevent the plaintiffs and HIV-negative inmates from engaging in high-risk behavior.\n\nThe district court found that the plaintiffs' recommended level of security staffing would not prevent\n\nhigh-risk behavior, but implied that the Department of Corrections' claimed necessary level of\n\nstaffing—60 additional guards all together—would adequately reduce the risk.71 This level of\n\nstaffing, the court concluded, would place an undue financial and administrative burden on the\n\nalready-strapped prison system.72 This conclusion was based on the effect system-wide of\n\naccommodating the plaintiffs in all the programs at issue: the court emphasized that it would \"see\n\"the forest as well as the individual trees.' \"73 The plaintiffs claim that the district court erred either\nby failing to consider the burden in each program separately or, alternatively, by failing to pick\n\nparticular programs to which limited resources should be allocated.74 The plaintiffs suggest that the\n\n   70\n        Harris v.

Whether an accommodation imposes an undue burden on a\n\ndefendant is determined by \"the hardships imposed by the plaintiff's preferred accommodation in\n\nthe context of the particular agency's operations.\"75 And cost is a hardship properly taken into\n\naccount in assessing whether the burden on a federal-fund grantee is undue.76 Assessing that cost\n\naccommodation-by-accommodation, and not in the aggregate, effectively defeats the purpose of the\n\nagency-specific analysis: it permits impositions of burdens that could nickel-and-dime an agency\n\nto extinction. That reasoning ignores, rather than examines, the \"context of the particular agency's\n\noperations.\" Thus, if the plaintiffs demand to be accommodated system-wide, the total cost to the\n\nDepartment of Corrections is the relevant cost for determining the agency's burden. Adding 60\n\nguards at Tutwiler and Limestone, as the record suggests are needed to ensure security, would\n\nrequire a nearly 20% increase in guard staffing.77 The district court could conclude based on this\n\nrecord that accommodation by an increase in staffing would place an undue hardship on the\n\nDepartment of Corrections.\n\n        The plaintiffs further fault the district court for not considering whether the Department of\n\nCorrections in fact needed all the guards it currently has stationed where they are currently stationed,\n\nand for not choosing certain programs for integration if it is indeed true that providing all the guards\nnecessary would be an undue burden. The plaintiffs cite no evidence in the record, however, that\n\nindicates that any guards elsewhere are unnecessary. To the contrary, the record suggests that both\n\n\n\n   75\n    Willis v.

The plaintiffs thus failed to carry their burden of proof that alternate, less\n\nburdensome reasonable accommodations exist by moving correctional officers from other posts to\n\nHIV-protection posts. The district court's conclusion should accordingly be upheld.\n\n                             D. Reassignment to Another District Judge\n\n          The plaintiffs in this case sought Judge Varner's recusal on a variety of grounds. Judge\n\nVarner refused to recuse himself, and the plaintiffs appeal the denial of their motion and suggest,\n\nin the alternative, that the case be assigned on remand to another judge. Among the reasons for this\n\nremedy they point to Judge Varner's remarks on the bench and in his opinion, the judge's law clerk's\n\nfather-son relationship to the defendants' lead counsel, and the judge's possible learning of facts\n\npertinent to the medical issues in this case from the judge's son, a physician. The majority properly\n\nconcludes that the record does not sufficiently evince bias or impropriety that required Judge Varner\n\nto recuse himself under the Supreme Court's interpretation of 28 U.S.C. § 455.79 But the majority\n\nthen adopts a \"middle course\"—reassigning the action—that leaves Judge Varner stained with\n\nimpropriety's brush. This \"middle course\" is extreme and unnecessary in this case.\n\n          Reassignment is rare in this circuit and is generally appropriate only when three factors\n\nweigh in favor of it: (1) whether the original judge would have had difficulty putting his previous\nviews and findings aside; (2) whether reassignment is appropriate to preserve the appearance of\n\njustice; and (3) whether reassignment would entail waste and duplication out of proportion to the\n\ngains realized from reassignment.80 None of these factors points to reassignment in this case.\n\n\n   78\n    Warden Lobmiller of Tutwiler requested 179 guards in 1993 and was authorized to employ\n90.

Far from ignoring this court's mandate, his 475-\n\npage opinion meticulously reviews the individual evidence about the location, circumstances, and\n\nsecurity concerns for dozens and dozens of separate programs. Nor is the appearance of justice\n\nimperiled here. As the majority observes, Judge Varner's remarks do not show any bias mandating\n\nrecusal,83 and the evidence of impropriety is also insufficient to warrant recusal. This court should\n\non this record be as hesitant to direct reassignment as it is to find recusal to be mandated.
