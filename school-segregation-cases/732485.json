Two suits were commenced in 1966.  Our first opinion, by a divided court, appears in Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority, et al., 436 F.2d 306 (7 Cir., 1970).  We there held it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to impose dead lines and to order the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) to use its best efforts to increase the supply of dwelling units as rapidly as possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the second appeal (Gautreaux v. Romney, 448 F.2d 731 (7 Cir., 1971)), we concluded that summary judgment should be granted to plaintiffs on both Counts I (Fifth Amendment) and II (42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000d, Sec. 601 of Civil Rights Act of 1964), and that HUD had violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment by its acquiescence in the pre-1969 site selection procedure of Chicago Housing Authority.  However, we made the following statement: \"[We] again point out that our holding should not be construed as granting a broad license for interference with the programs and actions of an already beleaguered federal agency [HUD] It may well be that the District Judge, in his wise discretion, will conclude that little equitable relief above the entry of a declaratory judgment and a simple 'best efforts' clause will be necessary to remedy the wrongs which have been found to have been committed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court did not choose to follow our suggestions in this respect.  On October 1, 1971, 332 F.Supp. 366, the court signed an order enjoining the defendant, George W. Romney, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from making available to the City of Chicago, any funds for the second period of the Model Cities Program unless the City complied with certain stated conditions.  This order involved the withholding of approximately $26,000,000 in federal funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Funds for the purpose of constructing, maintaining and achieving low rent housing are provided by the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1401 et seq.).  The Secretary of HUD is charged by law with the administration of such funds.  CHA does not provide any housing, low rent or otherwise, with any funds distributed under the Model Cities Programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Model Cities Programs are created under the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. Secs. 3301 et seq.).  Under these Programs the Secretary of HUD is authorized to grant funds for the purpose of enabling cities to undertake various programs for the benefit of low and moderate income people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this legislation, the City of Chicago is and has been carrying on a five-year Model Cities Program.  The City has received or was scheduled to receive $38,000,000 a year to carry on various services, which included numerous educational and job-training programs, health care centers, day care centers and other related activities.  Approximately 4000 people are employed to carry out the Model Cities Program of Chicago and its related activities.  The chief beneficiaries are the poor people of Chicago, many of whom are black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among those greatly benefited by the Model Cities Programs are 4328 CHA tenant families at the Robert Taylor Homes (population 27,030), and the 1444 tenant families at the Washington Park Homes (population 8755), located in the City of Chicago.  These developments are within the near South Side Model Cities target areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no District Court findings that the Chicago Model Cities Program has been improperly administered or that it is tainted with racial discrimination.  Indeed, the plaintiffs have made no such claim.  About 150,000 people are direct beneficiaries of one or more of the Model Cities Programs' activities in the Chicago area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HUD was prepared to release the remaining sum of $26,000,000 to this Model Cities Program.  It would have done so except for this proceeding instituted by plaintiffs.  It is candidly admitted that the purpose of the District Court's order was intended to apply pressure on the City of Chicago to compel it to approve of CHA housing sites.  The decision to release the $26,000,000 for Model Cities Programs was that of George Vavoulis, HUD Regional Director.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Regional Director (Vavoulis) was greatly concerned at the devastating impact upon the city's poor which would follow the cutting off of the Model Cities Programs and which, he felt, would far outweigh the hope of spurring the Chicago City Council into action approving low cost public housing sites in predominantly white areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Intervenor-appellants well state the question before us to be: \"But here one party (HUD) had been ordered to stop financing a program, Model Cities, which is free from taint, in order to force a non-party (City of Chicago) to comply with an order in a case in which it was not a party, nor charged with anything, nor found to have done anything improper and of course, not ordered to do anything.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a Civil Rights case, the Court's task is \"to correct, by a balancing of the individual and collective interests, the condition that offends the Constitution.\"  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1276, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971).  But here there was no balancing of interests.  The rights of the many thousands of beneficiaries of the Model Cities Program were entirely ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court here proceeded as though HUD, in some court proceeding, had been found guilty of some wrongdoing in administering the Model Cities Program in Chicago.  This, of course, is not the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a memo to the District Court, HUD stated with reference to the Housing program: \"Although the city's [Chicago] performance to date has not come up to expectations, nevertheless, the city has made some progress in achieving the housing goals set forth in the letter of intent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HUD also wrote to the District Court: \". . . and since Model Cities money will contribute to essential social services for inter-city residents, it would not be in the best interests of HUD or the citizens of Chicago, to withhold the Model City Funds at this time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it was improper for the District Court to threaten the termination of a program which was not tainted with discriminatory action in order to bring about a cure of a separate program which was found to have been so tainted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, the District Court's order lacked a balancing of the individual and collective interests involved.  The Court ignored the interest of poor people, mostly black, intended by Congress to be the beneficiaries of the Model Cities Programs while seeking enforcement of a timetable for the erection of housing units in white areas which, although laudable, could not be achieved in time to prevent the catastrophe threatened by the District Court's order terminating federal funds to a program not found to be discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our mandate of Gautreaux v. Romney, supra, (Gautreaux II) issued on September 10, 1971, and in the mandate of the earlier companion litigation decided by our Court, Gautreaux v. CHA, supra (Gautreaux I), we found violations of plaintiffs' rights in federal and city programs for low-income public housing to be made available to low-income families in Chicago.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of minimal Model Cities Program involvement with low-cost public housing for low-income families, the District Court, following our mandate in Gautreaux II, found it advisable to terminate the entire Model Cities Program in Chicago in order to bring pressure to bear upon the Chicago Housing Authority, the Chicago City Council and the Mayor of Chicago.  While the Model Cities Program in Chicago does include activities affecting housing and relocation (six of fifty or more Model Cities Program activities) within its broad aim of social, economic and educational assistance to low-income families, these six activities entail expenditures of only $3,000,000 of a total annual budget of $38,000,000 for the Model Cities Program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last of a series of letters between Mr. Vavoulis, the Regional Director of HUD, and the Mayor of Chicago, dated January 6, 1972, the entire annual funding of $20,000,000 for the Neighborhood Development Program (NDP) for 1971 was formally terminated by HUD.  Mr. Vavoulis stated as his rationale for such termination: \"It was our [HUD's] sincere belief that the City and CHA proposals as outlined in the Letter of Intent [May 12, 1971 letter] would lead to a meaningful replacement and expansion of the housing supply for Chicago's low income families . . . that result has not occurred. . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue on this appeal that if HUD was justified in refusing the NDP program, it hardly could have been an abuse of discretion for the District Court to direct HUD to take the same position with respect to the Model Cities Program, owing to the fact that both programs have essentially the same relocation requirements.  What plaintiffs fail to realize in their argument is the fact that relocation and housing is the entire purpose of the NDP program while, as noted previously, relocation and housing-related activities compose only six of fifty or more activities under the Model Cities Program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Board of Public Instruction of Taylor County, Fla. v. Finch, 414 F.2d 1068 (5 Cir., 1969), a case discussed by all parties to this appeal, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare terminated all federally-financed activities because of segregation in elementary schools and high schools in the county.  The Court of Appeals held that schools and programs are not condemned en masse by Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where racial discrimination and segregation are found in isolated activities, but only if such activities utilize federal money for unconstitutional ends.  The Court of Appeals in Taylor County, supra, reasoned that wholesale cutoffs of federal funds from all related federally-funded programs was not required under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Instead, a case-by-case application of principles of nondiscrimination to particular activities should be applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs assert that Section 602 applies to administrative, not to judicial termination of funds, and certainly is not inhibiting on the equitable remedial powers of federal courts.  Yet, Section 602 and the mandate of the Taylor County, supra, decision, prohibit HUD and other federal agencies from doing precisely what the District Court has ordered-enjoining all federal funding from a program where the only possible violations found in Gautreaux I and II might possibly exist in six of fifty or more activities.  Heretofore, no discrimination has been found in these six activities of the Model Cities Program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy of limiting administrative power to terminate federal funds to activities which only are discriminatory or segregated, was not for the protection of the political entity whose funds were severed, but for the innocent beneficiaries of the programs and activities not tainted by discriminatory tactics.  As indicated by the comments of Senator Pastore in debates concerning the adoption of Section 602-\"'. . . We would not have to cut off assistance to 100 people because 1 person was being discriminatory in the administration of the money.\"'  (Quoted 414 F.2d at 1075, 76 n. 12), the aim of the Act was not to deprive needy recipients of funds for nondiscriminatory programs or activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was and is the desire of the United States Government to provide breakfasts, day-care centers, improved and expanded educational facilities and adequate medical facilities for the needy through the Model Cities Programs.  Other Program activities included nondiscriminatory public housing encompassed in six of the fifty activities of the Program.  We believe Congress did not desire a policy of forsaking all the beneficial aspects of the Model Cities Program not tainted by discrimination for one aspect of the Program which could be, but has not yet been found to be discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of HUD that Model Cities funds should be released was supported by the evidence in this case.  In our view, the District Court's judgment and the November 11, 1971 order enjoining all these funds, was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant Romney and the various Intervenor-appellants have appealed both the order of the District Court issued on October 1, 1971 and the injunction granted by the District Court on November 11, 1971 following the issuance of our mandate in Gautreaux II.  Motions were presented by the various appellants to our Court to consolidate the two appeals: that the record of the first appeal stand as the record in the consolidated appeal; that the briefs for the prior appeal stand for the subsequent briefs; that the prior briefing schedule remain in effect and that the time for oral argument similarly remain in effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only motion presented by plaintiffs-appellees was a motion to dismiss the prior appeal of the October 1, 1971 order for reason of mootness.  Plaintiffs argue the order lapsed by its terms upon our issuance of the Gautreaux II mandate, and the substantive issues of both appeals are identical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We feel the motion to dismiss the appeal of the October 1, 1971 order made by plaintiffs-appellees on appeal is persuasive.  The November 11, 1971 injunction incorporated the entirety of the requirements and guidelines of the October 1, 1971 order following the issuance of the Gautreaux II mandate.  Therefore, the appeals numbered 71-1732, 71-1733 and 17-1734 before our Court, appealing the October 1, 1971 order, should be dismissed for reason of mootness.  The issues raised by this appeal are before our Court in this appeal of the November 11, 1971 injunction, Appeal No. 71-1807, and were considered herein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By reason of our finding that the November 11, 1971 injunction granted plaintiffs-appellees was an abuse of discretion by the District Judge, we reverse his judgment and remand this cause to the District Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SPRECHER, Circuit Judge (dissentings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question posed by this appeal is whether a district court can or should cut off federal funds to the City of Chicago under the Model Cities Program because of the city's failure to approve housing sites in predominantly white neighborhoods under the federal Low-Rent Housing Program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Black tenants in and applicants for public housing brought suit in 1966 against the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA).  Plaintiffs charged that CHA intentionally violated 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981 and 1983 in maintaining existing patterns of residential separation of races by its tenant-assignment and site-selection procedures, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting the plaintiffs a summary judgment upon \"thousands of pages of depositions, affidavits and exhibits,\" the district court found: (1) Until 1954, CHA refused to permit black families to reside in four public housing projects located in white neighborhoods and built before 1944.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  (2) Since 1954, CHA had imposed a black quota on the four projects; as of December 31, 1967, black tenants occupied between 1 and 7 percent of the 1,654 units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  (3) As of July, 1968, CHA operated 64 public housing sites with 30,848 units; except for the four segregated white projects, the tenants were 99 percent black.  (4) Exclusive of the four white projects, 99 1/2 percent of the total units operated by CHA were located in areas which were or soon would be substantially all black.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  (5) About 90 percent of the waiting list of 13,000 persons were black.  (6) The City Council under Illinois law must approve all sites prior to acquisition by CHA.  (7) A pre-clearance arrangement existed under which CHA informally submitted sites for family housing to the alderman in whose ward the site was located.  The aldermen to whom sites in white neighborhoods were submitted vetoed these sites on racial grounds.  Between 1954 and 1967 CHA selected sites for 18,784 family units, of which 7,883 were in white areas and 10,901 in black areas.  The City Council rejected 99 1/2 percent of the units proposed for white sites, but only 10 percent of the black units.  (8) There were in the City of Chicago 188,000 white families and 76,000 black families eligible for public housing, but most white families did not choose to move into all-black projects in all-black neighborhoods.

The judgment order was declared to bind not only CHA but also \"those persons, including the members of the City Council of the City of Chicago, in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of this order by personal service or otherwise.\"  Finally, the court required that \"CHA shall affirmatively administer its public housing system . . . to the end of disestablishing the segregated public housing system which has resulted from CHA's unconstitutional site selection and tenant assignment procedures\" and that \"CHA shall use its best efforts to increase the supply of Dwelling Units as rapidly as possible. . . .\" Gautreaux v.

Plaintiffs were advised that CHA had no intention to submit any sites prior to the Chicago mayoralty election scheduled for April, 1971.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 20, 1970, the district court modified the \"best efforts\" provision of the judgment order to require CHA to submit sites for no fewer than 1,500 dwelling units to the City Council on or prior to September 20, 1970.  On appeal, the timetable order (revised to take into account appeal time) was affirmed by this court in Gautreaux v.

Plaintiffs sought a declaration that HUD had \"assisted in the carrying on . . . of a racially discriminatory public housing system, within the City of Chicago\" and an injunction against HUD's making available to CHA any federal funds to be used in connection with or in support of the racially discriminatory aspects of the Chicago public housing system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that case, the district court had dismissed all four counts of the complaint.

Sec. 3301 et seq.).  In approving the first-year grant, HUD advised the city:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>\"The Department . . . expects full compliance by the City and all its agencies . . . with the provisions of any decree finally entered by the U.

On November 19, 1970, a \"team composed of city and HUD regional staff\" had found that, to maintain the July 1, 1969 housing supply level for low-income families, 6,200 new units were required.  However, HUD advised the city that, in view of the difficulty of accomplishing that task, it would accept the reduced figure of 4,300 units \"if the plans to provide the lesser number of units are quite precise.\"  HUD said it would not approve funds for the second year of the Model Cities Program nor funds for the second year of Chicago's Neighborhood Development Program under the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. Secs. 1469-1469c) until the city had provided \"specific plans to overcome this deficit of 4300 units.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter a \"letter of intention\" was signed on May 12, 1971 by the mayor of Chicago, the chairman of CHA and the regional administrator of HUD, indicating in detail how the housing deficiency would be met.  CHA was to acquire sites for 1,700 units under a timetable of 500 units by June 15, 1971, 350 units by September 15, 1971, and 850 units by December 15, 1971.  On June 21, 1971, HUD approved $26 million for the second year of the Model Cities Program (HUD had previously released $12 million) \"on the condition that . . . Chicago Housing Authority will continue to show progress toward the housing goals set forth in the Letter of Intention.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By September 15, 1971, sites for only 288 low-income public housing units in predominantly white areas had been approved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court's opinion in Gautreaux v. Romney, 448 F.2d 731, was handed down September 10, 1971.  On September 17, before the mandate issued, the plaintiffs moved the district court under Rule 62(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for an \"injunction pending appeal.\"  During a four-day hearing, the regional administrator of HUD testified that he had determined to release the Model Cities funds to Chicago.  The court then enjoined HUD from paying Chicago any monies for the second year of the Model Cities Program unless and until 700 housing units had been given City Council approval.  The order was appealed by CHA, the City of Chicago and the Central Advisory Council, an organization representing present tenants in CHA public housing, all of which had intervened in the HUD case prior to the entry of the order (Appeals Nos. 71-1732, 71-1733 and 71-1734).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mandate issued on November 11, 1971 and, on plaintiffs' motion for an order pending final judgment, the district court on the same day entered an order similar to the October 1 order.  It enjoined HUD from paying Chicago any second-year Model Cities Program money unless at least 700 dwelling units in white areas had received City Council approval.  HUD appealed the November 11 order (Appeal No. 71-1807).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first inquiry should be whether the district court possessed sufficient equitable power to enjoin HUD from disbursing Model Cities funds to Chicago until the City Council approved sites for 700 units in predominantly white areas under another HUD-supervised program, the Low-Rent Housing Program (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1401 et seq.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acting as chancellor, a federal district judge has broad and flexible powers of equity to mold each decree to the necessities of the particular case and to remedy the consequences of past constitutional violations.

The Supreme Court has held that school authorities are \"clearly charged with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch.\"  Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 437-438, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 1694, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968).  When local authorities fail in their affirmative obligations, federal courts must step in.  The Supreme Court recently discussed the nature of judicial power in such a situation in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 28, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1282, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>\"The remedy for such segregation may be administratively awkward, inconvenient and even bizarre in some situations and may impose burdens on some; but all awkwardness and inconvenience cannot be avoided in the interim period when remedial adjustments are being made to eliminate the dual school systems. . . .\"In this area, we must of necessity rely to a large extent . . . on the informed judgment of the district courts in the first instance and on courts of appeal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I conclude that the district court in the present case possessed the equitable power to fashion the remedy which he applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A more difficult question is whether the lower court, armed with this power, abused its discretion in cutting off funds to one federal program in order to promote fair housing under another government program.  Although the congressional mandate requiring the affirmative provision of fair housing amply justifies full opening of the judicial arsenal, selection of the weaponry requires a delicate balancing of competing interests and policies. \"No fixed or even substantially fixed guidelines can be established as to how far a court can go, but it must be recognized that there are limits.\"  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 28, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1282, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first and most obvious guideline is what power the executive branch, in affirmatively providing fair housing, has to cut off the funds from one program to achieve fair housing under another program.

The HUD Model Cities Handbook (CDA Letter No. 5) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p>\"The following actions are representative of the type of activities which should be undertaken by local agencies and the community in order to achieve the objective of equal opportunity in housing. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>\"7.

Subsequently, HUD reversed its position and released the $26-million balance for the second-year Model Cities Program, but HUD did in fact cut off the second-year funds in the amount of $20 million for the Neighborhood Development Program because of the city's failure to provide the relocation units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether HUD properly exercised its discretion in determining to release the $26-million Model Cities funds is not the subject of this appeal, although such exercise of discretion is reviewable in a proper case.  Shannon v. United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, 436 F.2d 809, 819 (3rd Cir. 1970).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, for the purpose of this appeal it appears to me that, because HUD had the power to and did condition the release of funds for one program upon the observance of requirements for another program, the district court had a sound guideline to follow when he did the same thing. \"There is of course no question that the Federal Government, unless barred by some controlling constitutional prohibition, may impose the terms and conditions upon which its money allotments to the States shall be disbursed. . . .\" King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 333 n. 34, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 2141, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968).  Here the \"constitutional prohibition\" does not bar the withholding of funds; it tends to impel it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second guideline is balancing competing interests. \"The qualities of mercy and practicality have made equity the instrument for nice adjustment and reconciliation between the public interest and private needs as well as between competing private claims.\"  Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329-330, 64 S.Ct. 587, 592, 88 L.Ed. 754 (1944).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic adjustment of equities here requires a balancing of the positive gains to poor and disadvantaged persons resulting from a disbursement of the Model Cities funds, as against the possible effectiveness of diminishing racially discriminatory housing by the withholding of those funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HUD has capsulized the dire results of stopping the funds in its brief: \"[N]early 4,000 people would lose their jobs and Model Cities services to thousands of people would be halted.  Eighteen day care centers serving 1,100 children would close; hot breakfasts and lunches for over 10,000 school children daily would be discontinued; teachertraining projects and construction of capital programs would be ended. . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have pointed out that the second year of the Chicago Model Cities Program terminated on December 31, 1971, and the $26 million ordered by the district court would not affect services and programs already completed.  I recognize, however, that without being reimbursed for the $26 million already spent, Chicago would be required to raise the lost funds either through increased taxation or by reducing other services in the future, most likely future Model Cities services.  Nor does the fact that CHA and the City of Chicago \"hold the key to the jailhouse door\" and could solve the dilemma very simply by providing the required units of low-rent housing and thereby release the Model Cities funds, alter the stark reality that, if they do not elect to do so, completely innocent people will suffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not everyone agrees on the priorities of the Model Cities Program beneficiaries.  Amici in this case, the Chicago Chapter and Operation Breadbasket of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, have argued that \"4,000 jobs now held by, and which may become lost to model area residents may not be the most crucial issue in this case; certainly not against a background of more than twenty years of deliberate and covert racial discrimination in housing . . . and . . . an invidious, conscious and concerted refusal by the . . . City of Chicago and CHA to now provide additional housing (which would also mean increased employment opportunity) for this City's Black and White low income families.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court's remedy may appear to be harsh and drastic when viewed in isolation, the problem it seeks to alleviate is crucial and monumental.  The failure of HUD and CHA to provide any low-cost public housing for several years, in view of the city's huge housing deficit gauged as long ago as mid-1969, affects black and white alike.  Lack of decent low-income housing is not only a major problem in itself,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> but it is a prodigious spawner of problems for black and white equally: poverty, unemployment, illness, malnutrition, despair, family disunity, crime, violence and civil disorder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When there is added to the appalling problem of lack of low-income housing for everyone, the separate problem of racial discrimination, the amalgam requires priority status, emergency treatment and drastic if not \"bizarre\" remedies.  The specific problem on which this appeal is focused is the increasing concentration of non-whites in the slums and ghettos of the inner city, where they are imprisoned by the \"white suburban noose.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  The prisoners of slums and ghettos endure not only substandard housing, but a higher incidence of death and disease, inferior schools, inferior job opportunities, inferior community services, inferior municipal services, \"all amidst physical decay and psychological outrage.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For many years the public housing program and its federal and local administrators have contributed to the increasing segregation of the black inner city from the white suburbs<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> through discriminatory site selection,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> ghetto highrise monstrosities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> and pervasive footdragging.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The focal problem of racial polarization is not confined to Chicago by any means; it is a national crisis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  The fact remains, however, that in this case CHA (296 F.Supp. 907) and HUD (448 F.2d 731) have been found guilty of deliberately fostering racial discrimination in Chicago.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Model Cities Program is undoubtedly accomplishing much good.  As the Shannon court said, \"[T]here will be instances where a pressing case may be made for the rebuilding of a racial ghetto.\"  Shannon v. United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, 436 F.2d 809, 822 (3rd Cir. 1970).  But as Judge Duffy observed in an earlier Gautreaux opinion, \"the situation before us now already has been held not to constitute such a pressing case, and such is the determinative factor.\" 448 F.2d at 740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The idea of withholding federal funds from one program to enforce another is not entirely novel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  Two of the recommendations of the Douglas Commission were:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p>No. 7: \"The Commission recommends that Congress amend the National Housing Act to change drastically the philosophy, methodology, and financial arrangements for Federal assistance in the provision of low-income housing, by adopting an active approach in dealing with localities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p>No. 12: \"The Commission recommends that the Congress enact legislation to provide that all financial assistance programs (including grants, loans, and loan guarantees) administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development be conditioned upon the existence within the local government area being served of an enforceable open occupancy ordinance, or in lieu thereof, enforceable State legislation providing for open occupancy.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first recommendation was realized with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 25, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1280, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971).  The Douglas Commission, in making recommendation No. 12 above, believed \"it most unlikely that localities would prefer to do without Federal assistance rather than to enact and enforce open housing legislation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court here obviously believed that the remedy would be effective.  He said that he would \"sugar-coat the pill\" to make it attractive to Chicago by requiring the approval of only half as many units as the amount reasonably needed to recapture the Model Cities funds.  Gautreaux v. Romney, 332 F.Supp. 366, 370 (N.D.Ill.1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court has been hearing this controversy on virtually a day-to-day basis since 1966.  His past efforts at molding a remedy have been cautious; in 1969 he abjured from employing a \"drastic kind of relief-that of enjoining the use of federal funds.\" 296 F.Supp. at 915.  Since then, his orders have been ignored and his efforts frustrated.  In our last opinion in this case, we deferred to his \"wise discretion,\" although we cautioned against \"granting a broad license for interference with the programs and actions of an already beleaguered federal agency.\" 448 F.2d at 740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's past remedies have proved to be wise and at least partially effective.  For example, his July 1, 1969 order provided for scattered-site, low-rise housing.  Experts agree that these are now mandatory requirements of new public housing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  Prompted by his order, Chicago and the CHA having made verbal commitments to scattered-site housing; the City Council has approved sites for 288 such units.

Sec. 2000d, Sec. 601 of Civil Rights Act of 1964), and that HUD had violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment by its acquiescence in the pre-1969 site selection procedure of Chicago Housing Authority.  However, we made the following statement: \"[We] again point out that our holding should not be construed as granting a broad license for interference with the programs and actions of an already beleaguered federal agency [HUD] It may well be that the District Judge, in his wise discretion, will conclude that little equitable relief above the entry of a declaratory judgment and a simple 'best efforts' clause will be necessary to remedy the wrongs which have been found to have been committed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court did not choose to follow our suggestions in this respect.

Romney, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from making available to the City of Chicago, any funds for the second period of the Model Cities Program unless the City complied with certain stated conditions.  This order involved the withholding of approximately $26,000,000 in federal funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Funds for the purpose of constructing, maintaining and achieving low rent housing are provided by the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1401 et seq.).  The Secretary of HUD is charged by law with the administration of such funds.  CHA does not provide any housing, low rent or otherwise, with any funds distributed under the Model Cities Programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Model Cities Programs are created under the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. Secs. 3301 et seq.).  Under these Programs the Secretary of HUD is authorized to grant funds for the purpose of enabling cities to undertake various programs for the benefit of low and moderate income people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this legislation, the City of Chicago is and has been carrying on a five-year Model Cities Program.  The City has received or was scheduled to receive $38,000,000 a year to carry on various services, which included numerous educational and job-training programs, health care centers, day care centers and other related activities.  Approximately 4000 people are employed to carry out the Model Cities Program of Chicago and its related activities.  The chief beneficiaries are the poor people of Chicago, many of whom are black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among those greatly benefited by the Model Cities Programs are 4328 CHA tenant families at the Robert Taylor Homes (population 27,030), and the 1444 tenant families at the Washington Park Homes (population 8755), located in the City of Chicago.  These developments are within the near South Side Model Cities target areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no District Court findings that the Chicago Model Cities Program has been improperly administered or that it is tainted with racial discrimination.  Indeed, the plaintiffs have made no such claim.  About 150,000 people are direct beneficiaries of one or more of the Model Cities Programs' activities in the Chicago area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HUD was prepared to release the remaining sum of $26,000,000 to this Model Cities Program.  It would have done so except for this proceeding instituted by plaintiffs.  It is candidly admitted that the purpose of the District Court's order was intended to apply pressure on the City of Chicago to compel it to approve of CHA housing sites.  The decision to release the $26,000,000 for Model Cities Programs was that of George Vavoulis, HUD Regional Director.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Regional Director (Vavoulis) was greatly concerned at the devastating impact upon the city's poor which would follow the cutting off of the Model Cities Programs and which, he felt, would far outweigh the hope of spurring the Chicago City Council into action approving low cost public housing sites in predominantly white areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Intervenor-appellants well state the question before us to be: \"But here one party (HUD) had been ordered to stop financing a program, Model Cities, which is free from taint, in order to force a non-party (City of Chicago) to comply with an order in a case in which it was not a party, nor charged with anything, nor found to have done anything improper and of course, not ordered to do anything.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a Civil Rights case, the Court's task is \"to correct, by a balancing of the individual and collective interests, the condition that offends the Constitution.\"  Swann v.

The rights of the many thousands of beneficiaries of the Model Cities Program were entirely ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court here proceeded as though HUD, in some court proceeding, had been found guilty of some wrongdoing in administering the Model Cities Program in Chicago.  This, of course, is not the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a memo to the District Court, HUD stated with reference to the Housing program: \"Although the city's [Chicago] performance to date has not come up to expectations, nevertheless, the city has made some progress in achieving the housing goals set forth in the letter of intent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HUD also wrote to the District Court: \". . . and since Model Cities money will contribute to essential social services for inter-city residents, it would not be in the best interests of HUD or the citizens of Chicago, to withhold the Model City Funds at this time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it was improper for the District Court to threaten the termination of a program which was not tainted with discriminatory action in order to bring about a cure of a separate program which was found to have been so tainted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, the District Court's order lacked a balancing of the individual and collective interests involved.  The Court ignored the interest of poor people, mostly black, intended by Congress to be the beneficiaries of the Model Cities Programs while seeking enforcement of a timetable for the erection of housing units in white areas which, although laudable, could not be achieved in time to prevent the catastrophe threatened by the District Court's order terminating federal funds to a program not found to be discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our mandate of Gautreaux v. Romney, supra, (Gautreaux II) issued on September 10, 1971, and in the mandate of the earlier companion litigation decided by our Court, Gautreaux v. CHA, supra (Gautreaux I), we found violations of plaintiffs' rights in federal and city programs for low-income public housing to be made available to low-income families in Chicago.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of minimal Model Cities Program involvement with low-cost public housing for low-income families, the District Court, following our mandate in Gautreaux II, found it advisable to terminate the entire Model Cities Program in Chicago in order to bring pressure to bear upon the Chicago Housing Authority, the Chicago City Council and the Mayor of Chicago.  While the Model Cities Program in Chicago does include activities affecting housing and relocation (six of fifty or more Model Cities Program activities) within its broad aim of social, economic and educational assistance to low-income families, these six activities entail expenditures of only $3,000,000 of a total annual budget of $38,000,000 for the Model Cities Program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last of a series of letters between Mr. Vavoulis, the Regional Director of HUD, and the Mayor of Chicago, dated January 6, 1972, the entire annual funding of $20,000,000 for the Neighborhood Development Program (NDP) for 1971 was formally terminated by HUD.  Mr. Vavoulis stated as his rationale for such termination: \"It was our [HUD's] sincere belief that the City and CHA proposals as outlined in the Letter of Intent [May 12, 1971 letter] would lead to a meaningful replacement and expansion of the housing supply for Chicago's low income families . . . that result has not occurred. . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue on this appeal that if HUD was justified in refusing the NDP program, it hardly could have been an abuse of discretion for the District Court to direct HUD to take the same position with respect to the Model Cities Program, owing to the fact that both programs have essentially the same relocation requirements.  What plaintiffs fail to realize in their argument is the fact that relocation and housing is the entire purpose of the NDP program while, as noted previously, relocation and housing-related activities compose only six of fifty or more activities under the Model Cities Program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Board of Public Instruction of Taylor County, Fla. v.

The Court of Appeals held that schools and programs are not condemned en masse by Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where racial discrimination and segregation are found in isolated activities, but only if such activities utilize federal money for unconstitutional ends.  The Court of Appeals in Taylor County, supra, reasoned that wholesale cutoffs of federal funds from all related federally-funded programs was not required under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Instead, a case-by-case application of principles of nondiscrimination to particular activities should be applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs assert that Section 602 applies to administrative, not to judicial termination of funds, and certainly is not inhibiting on the equitable remedial powers of federal courts.  Yet, Section 602 and the mandate of the Taylor County, supra, decision, prohibit HUD and other federal agencies from doing precisely what the District Court has ordered-enjoining all federal funding from a program where the only possible violations found in Gautreaux I and II might possibly exist in six of fifty or more activities.  Heretofore, no discrimination has been found in these six activities of the Model Cities Program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy of limiting administrative power to terminate federal funds to activities which only are discriminatory or segregated, was not for the protection of the political entity whose funds were severed, but for the innocent beneficiaries of the programs and activities not tainted by discriminatory tactics.  As indicated by the comments of Senator Pastore in debates concerning the adoption of Section 602-\"'. . . We would not have to cut off assistance to 100 people because 1 person was being discriminatory in the administration of the money.\"'  (Quoted 414 F.2d at 1075, 76 n. 12), the aim of the Act was not to deprive needy recipients of funds for nondiscriminatory programs or activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was and is the desire of the United States Government to provide breakfasts, day-care centers, improved and expanded educational facilities and adequate medical facilities for the needy through the Model Cities Programs.  Other Program activities included nondiscriminatory public housing encompassed in six of the fifty activities of the Program.  We believe Congress did not desire a policy of forsaking all the beneficial aspects of the Model Cities Program not tainted by discrimination for one aspect of the Program which could be, but has not yet been found to be discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of HUD that Model Cities funds should be released was supported by the evidence in this case.  In our view, the District Court's judgment and the November 11, 1971 order enjoining all these funds, was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant Romney and the various Intervenor-appellants have appealed both the order of the District Court issued on October 1, 1971 and the injunction granted by the District Court on November 11, 1971 following the issuance of our mandate in Gautreaux II.  Motions were presented by the various appellants to our Court to consolidate the two appeals: that the record of the first appeal stand as the record in the consolidated appeal; that the briefs for the prior appeal stand for the subsequent briefs; that the prior briefing schedule remain in effect and that the time for oral argument similarly remain in effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only motion presented by plaintiffs-appellees was a motion to dismiss the prior appeal of the October 1, 1971 order for reason of mootness.

Therefore, the appeals numbered 71-1732, 71-1733 and 17-1734 before our Court, appealing the October 1, 1971 order, should be dismissed for reason of mootness.

(7) A pre-clearance arrangement existed under which CHA informally submitted sites for family housing to the alderman in whose ward the site was located.  The aldermen to whom sites in white neighborhoods were submitted vetoed these sites on racial grounds.  Between 1954 and 1967 CHA selected sites for 18,784 family units, of which 7,883 were in white areas and 10,901 in black areas.  The City Council rejected 99 1/2 percent of the units proposed for white sites, but only 10 percent of the black units.  (8) There were in the City of Chicago 188,000 white families and 76,000 black families eligible for public housing, but most white families did not choose to move into all-black projects in all-black neighborhoods.

However, HUD advised the city that, in view of the difficulty of accomplishing that task, it would accept the reduced figure of 4,300 units \"if the plans to provide the lesser number of units are quite precise.\"  HUD said it would not approve funds for the second year of the Model Cities Program nor funds for the second year of Chicago's Neighborhood Development Program under the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C.

The court then enjoined HUD from paying Chicago any monies for the second year of the Model Cities Program unless and until 700 housing units had been given City Council approval.

I recognize, however, that without being reimbursed for the $26 million already spent, Chicago would be required to raise the lost funds either through increased taxation or by reducing other services in the future, most likely future Model Cities services.  Nor does the fact that CHA and the City of Chicago \"hold the key to the jailhouse door\" and could solve the dilemma very simply by providing the required units of low-rent housing and thereby release the Model Cities funds, alter the stark reality that, if they do not elect to do so, completely innocent people will suffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not everyone agrees on the priorities of the Model Cities Program beneficiaries.  Amici in this case, the Chicago Chapter and Operation Breadbasket of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, have argued that \"4,000 jobs now held by, and which may become lost to model area residents may not be the most crucial issue in this case; certainly not against a background of more than twenty years of deliberate and covert racial discrimination in housing . . . and . . . an invidious, conscious and concerted refusal by the . . . City of Chicago and CHA to now provide additional housing (which would also mean increased employment opportunity) for this City's Black and White low income families.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court's remedy may appear to be harsh and drastic when viewed in isolation, the problem it seeks to alleviate is crucial and monumental.  The failure of HUD and CHA to provide any low-cost public housing for several years, in view of the city's huge housing deficit gauged as long ago as mid-1969, affects black and white alike.  Lack of decent low-income housing is not only a major problem in itself,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> but it is a prodigious spawner of problems for black and white equally: poverty, unemployment, illness, malnutrition, despair, family disunity, crime, violence and civil disorder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When there is added to the appalling problem of lack of low-income housing for everyone, the separate problem of racial discrimination, the amalgam requires priority status, emergency treatment and drastic if not \"bizarre\" remedies.

Since then, his orders have been ignored and his efforts frustrated.  In our last opinion in this case, we deferred to his \"wise discretion,\" although we cautioned against \"granting a broad license for interference with the programs and actions of an already beleaguered federal agency.\" 448 F.2d at 740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's past remedies have proved to be wise and at least partially effective.
