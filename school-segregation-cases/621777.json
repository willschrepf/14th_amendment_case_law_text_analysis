In their Complaint, they asked for a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the Altheimer Public School District and the J. E. Stowers Construction Company from continuing plans to construct, and from constructing, separate elementary schools for white and Negro students.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> They also asked for a temporary and permanent injunction enjoining the School District from continuing the policy, practice, custom and usage of assigning pupils, faculty and administrative staff on a racially discriminatory basis and from continuing any policy or practice of racial discrimination in the operation of the Altheimer School District.  The case was argued before the Honorable J. Smith Henley, Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Pine Bluff Division, on March 31, 1966.  Judge Henley dismissed the Complaint in a momorandum decision handed down June 3, 1966.  The decision was subsequently appealed to this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Altheimer School District includes the town of Altheimer together with a substantial rural area of Jefferson County in the vicinity of the town.  It has a 67% Non-white population with a high concentration of poverty-stricken families-- a majority of whom are Negro.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The District could not be operated in its present manner without substantial federal funds.  In 1965-66, the District had a total enrollment of 1,408 students, of whom 741 were elementary students and 667 were junior and senior high students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the 1965-66 school year, the District maintained totally racially segregated schools.  Negro students were taught in a complex known as the Martin School, and white students in a complex known as the Altheimer School.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The two building complexes are within six blocks of each other.  Both sites serve students from grades one ghrough twelve.  About two-thirds of the students are transported to school by bus from outlying areas.  Each school operates its own bus system with the result that the bus routes are frequently duplicated.  The administrative staff of the District is entirely white except for the Negro principal of Martin High School.  The faculty, before 1965-66, was completely segregated, with white students taught only by white teachers and Negro students only by Negro teachers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the enactment of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the promulgation of guidelines by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (H.E.W.) implementing Title VI, the Altheimer School District submitted a voluntary plan of desegregation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> in April, 1965, which, after amendment, was finally approved by the Commissioner of Education and went into operation in September, 1965.  The plan adopted was the so-called 'freedom of choice'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> plan under which students may express choices for assignments to a particular school, the assignments to be honored as a matter of course unless they result in overcrowding.  In the event of overcrowding or a failure to exercise a choice, a student is supposed to be assigned to the school nearest his home where space is available.  All grades are afforded a choice each year.  The plan also requires the Board of Education to take affirmative steps to implement a desegregation plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the first year's operation of the 'freedom of choice' plan (1965-66), two Negro elementary students and four Negro high school students requested assignment to Altheimer.  No white students requested assignment to Martin.  All the Negro requests were granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1966-67, twenty-three Negro students requested and were granted admittance to Altheimer Elementary School and twenty-four Negro pupils requested and were granted admittance to the Altheimer High School.  No white students requested a transfer to Martin, which remained 100% Negro.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from a few white teachers who teach in the all-Negro school, the faculty of the District remains segregated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court supported its dismissal of the appellants' Complaint on the following grounds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The Board of Education, by adopting a 'freedom of choice' plan under which the doors of the formerly all-white school were opened to Negroes, satisfied the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.  If Briggs v. Elliott, 132 F.Supp. 776 (E.D.S.C.1955) is still good law, the Commissioner of Education is going further than the Constitution requires by seeking to fully integrate public school student bodies and faculties and to eliminate dual school facilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The H.E.W. Guidelines adopted by the School District (the Court stated it assumed they would be enforced and obeyed) are a prompt and reasonable start towards the elimination of unconstitutional racial discrimination within a reasonable time and is within the tolerance, if not beyond, the requirements of Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955) and Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The responsibility for the enforcement of the guidelines rests with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.  Since the guidelines may go beyond what the Constitution requires by requiring that there be full integration of public school student bodies and faculties and the elimination of dual facilities, the Court will leave their enforcement to H.E.W.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VALIDITY OF FREEDOM OF CHOICE PLAN</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants do not challenge the constitutionality of 'freedom of choice' plans per se;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> rather, they urge that the plan is inadequate to accomplish desegregation in this School District and, thus, that the lower court erred in dismissing the Complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we emphasize that this Court has rejected the Briggs approach.  Judge Gibson, writing in Kemp v. Beasley, 352 F.2d 14, 21 (8th Cir. 1965), stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In support of their 'freedom of choice' plan the Board places great reliance in the dicta found in Briggs v. Elliott, 132 F.Supp. 776, 777 (E.D.S.C.1955) to the effect 'the Constitution, in other words, does not require integration.  It merely forbids discrimination.'  Therefore, they argue that as long as the Negro is not required to attend the Negro school his constitutional rights have not been violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We cannot accept the position advanced by the Board on this matter.  The dictum in Briggs has not been followed or adopted by this Circuit and it is logically inconsistent with Brown and subsequent decisional law on the subject.  This well known dictum may be applicable in some logical areas where geographic zones permit of themselves without discrimination a segregated school system, but must be equally inapplicable if applied to school systems where the geographic or attendance zones are bi-racially populated. * * *'  See Dove v. Parham, 282 F.2d 256, 258 (8th Cir. 1960).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Briggs dictum also been rejected by the Fifth Circuit, United States et al. v. Jefferson County Bd. of Education et al., Civil No. 23345, 1966, 372 F.2d 836, rehearing held March, 1967, 380 F.2d 385; Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District 348 F.2d 729, 730, n. 5 (5th Cir. 1965); the Tenth Circuit in Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public Schools et al. v. Dowell et al., Civil No. 8523, 10th Cir., 1967 375 F.2d 158 and the Third Circuit in Evans v. Ennis, 281 F.2d 385 (3rd Cir. 1960), cert denied 364 U.S. 802, 81 S.Ct. 27, 5 L.Ed.2d 36 (1961).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, we have made it clear that a Board of Education does not satisfy its constitutional obligation to desegregate by simply opening the doors of a formerly all-white school to Negroes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Thus, in cases where we have approved the 'freedom of choice' plan, we have required (1) that students have the right to an annual choice and that if they fail to make a choice, they be assigned to a school on a non-racial basis, (2) that Boards of Education refrain from interfering with the student's 'freedom of choice,' and (3) that faculties and operating staffs be desegregated.  See e.g., Kemp v. Beasley, supra; Clark v. Board of Education of Little Rock School Dist.,369 F.2d 661 (8th Cir. 1966).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thirdly, this Court has stated that it will rely heavily on H.E.W. Guidelines.  In this case, however, the record indicates that compliance has been less than complete.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, this Court has made it clear that under their continuing responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of parties who appeal to it for protection, District Courts should retain jurisdiction in school segregation cases to insure (1) that a constitutionally acceptable plan is adopted, and (2) that it is operated in a constitutionally permissible fashion so that the goal of a desegregated, non-racially operated school system is rapidly and finally achieved.  Clark v. Board of Education of Little Rock School Dist., supra 369 F.2d at 671.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellee School District will not be fully desegregated nor the appellants assured of their rights under the Constitution so long as the Martin School clearly remains identifiable as a Negro school.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment are not satisfied by having one segregated and one desegregated school in a District.  We are aware that it will be difficult to desegregate the Martin School.  However, while the Difficulties are perhaps largely traditional in nature, the Board of Education has taken no steps since Brown to attempt to change its identity from a racial to a non-racial school.  It has made no effort to employ or assign white faculty members to Martin, and it has maintained a transportation policy which encourages the identification of Martin as a Negro school.  It has even failed to provide the school with sufficient funds, resulting in heavier class loads for its teachers, inferior library facilities and a lower scholastic rating.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  The construction program, which served as the basis of the appellants' Complaint, emphasized the intention of the Board of Education to maintain a racially segregated school system.  Under such circumstances, it is understandable that no white students can be expected to transfer to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the light of this background, the appellants urge that the 'freedom of choice' plan cannot effectively desegregate the schools in this District.  They ask that we require the Board of Education to take action immediately to integrate all of the elementary classes at one site and the secondary classes at the other.  Though this solution has great appeal because of its simplicity, and obvious efficiency, we are not prepared to hold at this time, in view of our recent decisions in Smith v. Board of Education of Morrilton Sch. Dist. No. 32, 365 F.2d 770 (8th Cir. 1966); Clark v. Board of Education of Little Rock, supra; and Kemp v. Beasley, supra, that desegregation in accordance with the Constitution cannot be accomplished if students are permitted to attend the schools of their choice.  See also, Lee et al. v. Macon County Board of Education et al., Civil No. 604-E, 267 F.Supp. 458 (D.C.E.D.Ala.1967).  In so solding, we make it clear, however, that we do not give our approval to the manner in which the Altheimer School District has met its responsibilities to desegregate the school system in the past, and we emphasize that if the plan is to be successful in the future, the Board of Education must remove every impediment to the exercise of a meaningful choice by students, and it must take action to eliminate those policies and practices which discourage the desegregation of the school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn then to consider the steps which must be taken by the appellee School District to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities, and to eliminate present obstacles to a 'free choice' by parents and students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">FACULTY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The faculty of the District is still largely segregated on the basis of race.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Not a single Negro serves as a classroom teacher in either the elementary or secondary white school.  Only one fulltime and three part-time white teachers are currently teaching in the Negro school.  Two additional white teachers perform some administrative and counselling duties in the Negro school.  A visitation program between teachers of the schools was initiated in 1965.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negro teachers are paid less than white teachers of comparable education, training, teaching experience and tasks,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> and they teach larger classes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board of Education took no steps to desegregate the faculty in the decade from Brown to the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and has taken only token steps since 1964.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only three Negro teachers and six white teachers, currently employed by the Board, were on the faculty at the time of Brown.  Thus, the Board has had numerous opportunities to desegregate the faculty when hiring and assigning new teachers.  Instead of doing so, it continued to hire and assign on the basis of race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Board of Education committed itself before the District Court and this Court to equalize salaries, no similar commitment has been made with respect to the class size or faculty desegregation;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> indeed, the superintendent of schools stated that he did not intend to reassign any of the teachers to a school other than the ones in which they were teaching at present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court, in Brown v. County School Board of Frederick County, Va.,245 F.Supp. 549, 560 (W.D.Va.1965), stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'* * * the presence of all Negro teachers in a school attended solely by Negro pupils in the past denotes that school a 'colored school' just as certainly as if the words were printed across its entrance in six-inch letters. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be added, that the converse is also true, that an all-white faculty in a school attended exclusively by whites in the past denotes that school as a 'white school.'The failure of the Board to take any steps towards desegregation of the faculty for more than a decade after Brown I and II, and the statement of the superintendent of schools that he does not intend to reassign faculty members within the school system make it highly probable that faculties will not be desegregated unless such action in compelled by this Court or by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Regardless of the steps which may be taken by H.E.W. to secure compliance, we will not avoid our responsibility in the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court and four Circuit Courts, including our own, have made it clear that a school District may not continue a segregated teaching staff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083, supra, the Court indicated problems relating to relocating staff to be one reason for permitting the desegregation process to proceed with all deliberate speed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, 345 F.2d 310 (4th Cir. 1965), the Fourth Circuit refused to consider the issue of faculty assignment by race.  The supreme Court, in a per curiam reversal of that case, 382 U.S. 103, 86 S.Ct. 224, 15 L.Ed.2d 187 (1965) held that faculty segregation had a direct impact on a desegregation plan, and that it was improper for the trial court to approve a desegregation plan without inquiring into the matter of faculty segregation.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court in a unanimous opinion, commented that 'there is not merit to the suggestion that the relation between faculty allocation on an alleged racial basis and the adequacy of the desegregation plans is entirely speculative.'  It emphasized the urgency of its ruling by stating that 'delays in desegregation of school systems are no longer tolerable.'  382 U.S., supra, at 105, 86 S.Ct. at 226.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Rogers v. Paul, 382 U.S. 198, 86 S.Ct. 358, 15 L.Ed.2d 265 (1965), the Supreme Court extended the undelayed right to challenge teacher segregation to students who had not yet themselves been affected by the school board's gradual desegregation plan.  In protecting the right of students to be taught in schools staffed on a non-racial basis, the Court, at page 200, 86 S.Ct. at 360, said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'* * * Two theories would give students not yet in desegregated grades sufficient interest to challenge racial allocation of faculty: (1) that racial allocation of faculty denies them equality of educational opportunity without regard to segregation of pupils; and (2) that it renders inadequate an otherwise constitutional pupil desegregation plan soon to be applied to their grades. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Circuits have also held that race must be eliminated as a basis for the employment and assignment of teachers, administrators and other personnel.

The Court recognizes the validity of the plaintiffs' complaint regarding the Board's failure to integrate the teaching staff.  Such discrimination is proscribed by Brown and also the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Smith v. Board of Education of Morrilton Sch. Dist. No. 32, supra, 365 F.2d at 778, Judge Blackmun said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It is our firm conclusion that the reach of the Brown decisions, although they specifically concerned only pupil discrimination, clearly extends to the proscription of the employment and assignment of public school teachers on a racial basis.  (Citing cases.)  This is particularly evident from the Supreme Court's positive indications that non-discriminatory allocation of faculty is indispensable to the validity of a desegregation plan. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And, in Clark v. Board of Education of Little Rock School Dist., supra, 369 F.2d at 669-670, Judge Gibson stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We agree that faculty segregation encourages pupil segregation and is detrimental to achieving a constitutionally required non-racially operated school system.  It is clear that the Board may not continue to operate a segregated teaching staff. * * *  It is also clear that the time for delay is past.  The desegregation of the teaching staff should have begun many years ago.  At this point the Board is going to have to take accelerated and positive action to end discriminatory practices in staff assignment and recruitment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'* * * We are not content at this late date to approve a desegregation plan that contains only a statement of general good intention.  We deem a positive commitment to a reasonable program aimed at ending segregation of the teaching staff to be necessary for the final approval of a constitutionally adequate desegregation plan. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From these decisions, it is clear that affirmative action must be taken by the Board of Education to eliminate segregation of the faculty.  While this may well be the most difficult problem in the desegregation process,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> it has been made more difficult by the failure of the Board to desegregate the faculties by filling vacancies on a non-racial basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot permit the difficulties involved in desegregating the faculties to deter us from achieving what the Constitution requires.  To facilitate faculty desegregation, we urge that the full understanding and cooperation of the Negro and white faculty be sought.  Experience has indicated that where an effort is made to obtain such cooperation, it is given, that the task is made easier and that the results are more productive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">FACILITIES</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The New Construction:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The School Board began discussions regarding construction of new elementary classrooms in 1957.  The planning for these classrooms proceeded on the basis that since the Martin and Altheimer Elementary Schools would continue to be segregated, a larger number of classrooms were needed for the Martin complex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Final action on construction was not taken until after April, 1965, at which time the Board decided to construct two new buildings, each containing eight elementary classrooms and related facilities at the Martin site, and a single building containing six elementary classrooms and related facilities at the Altheimer site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A school bond election was scheduled for September 28, 1965.  Prior to the election, one P.T.A. meeting was held at each school for discussion of the building program.  The 'Pine Bluff Commercial,' a newspaper of local distribution, carried stories of the construction plans in the July 22, September 26, and September 28, 1965, issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the bond election, a mimeographed notice urging parents to vote on the issue was sent home with the school child.  Proper legal notices of the election also appeared in the local newspapers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only 230 voters cast ballots in the election in which the bond issue was approved.  Following approval, the Board contracted with the J. E. Stowers Construction Company for building the facilities.  Five days after letting of the contract, the appellants filed the present suit to enjoin construction, contending that the building plan would tend to perpetuate racial segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The school superintendent testified that the Board (1) did not consider alternative building plans, (2) did not consider whether the construction would aid or hinder desegregation, and (3) was mainly concerned with the need to build the facilities.  He stated that by adopting the 'freedom of choice' plan, the Board had done all that was necessary to comply with the law.  He said that the Board would meet any problem of overcrowding when it arose but that at present, there was space for approximately sixty or seventy additional students at the Altheimer complex.  He indicated that if the number of applicants for either school exceeded available space, those pupils living nearest the overcrowded school would be assigned to it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' expert witness<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> stated that if the school construction was permitted as planned, segregation in the District would be prolonged.  He declared that there was no educational, financial, or other legitimate basis for the maintenance of two separate school complexes within such a small District or for additional construction of elementary buildings to serve two separate student bodies.  He maintained that the most practical way of eliminating segregation within the District would be to concentrate the elementary students at the Martin site and the secondary students at the Altheimer site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge rejected these arguments.  In dismissing the Complaint, he stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'If the defendant District can use freedom of choice, subject to the restrictions and requirements of the new guidelines, to bring about desegregation, as the Court holds that it can, there is no constitutional objection to the District's constructing buildings on both of its sites or on the Altheimer site.  As desegregation proceeds under the guidelines, it is clear that both sites will be used for the benefit of students of both races.  It must be remembered that when two school sites rather than one were established, the maintenance of dual school systems was generally if not universally considered to be constitutional, and there is nothing in the constitution which says that the District must now abandon one of its sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'As stated, the two sites are close together, and they can be used conveniently as components of the unitary school system which is now foreseeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The Court is not concerned here with whether it is wise or economical for the District to maintain the two sites or to construct elementary classroom buildings on both sites.  The Court is not convinced that in planning the new construction and in adhering to its plan following the passage of the Act the Board was motivated by a desire to perpetuate segregation, or that the effect of the construction will have that effect.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot agree with the reasons advanced by the trial court in support of its decision.  (1) The court's conclusion that both sites (unless clearly required) will be used for the benefit of both races is totally unsupported by the evidence and is contradicted by the court in its opinion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  (2) The District is not being asked to abandon one of its sites, but rather to use one site for an elementary school and the other for a secondary school.  (3) The testimony of the appellants that there was no economic or education justification for the Board's action stands virtually uncontradicted.  (4) The small vote on the bond election, the fact no survey of the Negro community was made, and the evidence that the Board never considered alternative plans which might have encouraged desegregation indicate to us a complete lack of community involvement in the decision to construct the new buildings, and a desire to retain the status quo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do the facts sustain the trial court's finding that the new buildings were not designed to perpetuate segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new buildings were the product of a ten-year building program begun when the District operated on a segregated basis.  The Board made no changes in the plans in response to the mandate of the Supreme Court in Brown or any subsequent decisions by either the Supreme Court or this Court.  Nor did the Civil Rights Act of 1964 cause the Board to alter its plans even though it finally agreed to desegregate the school system by indicating acceptance of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The traditional attendance patterns were assured by the addition of about twice the number of classrooms at the Negro site than at the white site, the ratio of classrooms to white and non-white students being 6/198 and 16/534, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court determined that if given a choice, white students would remain in an all-white school or a predominantly all-white school.  The superintendent's testimony indicates the Board was also aware of this axiom.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  Nevertheless, classroom space at the traditionally all-white Altheimer complex was limited to six classrooms.  This action sharply brough home to the Negro community the Board's expectation that their present and future children were to continue attending the traditionally all-Negro Martin School, and that there would not be room for them at Altheimer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Board limited the size of Altheimer Elementary School to the point where it is impossible for it to meet the standards established in the H.E.W. Guidelines.  Under the guidelines, an enrollment of from 150 to 180 students in a minority situation by the fall of 1967 would be deemed satisfactory progress.  Since no white students can be expected to request a transfer to Martin under the 'freedom of choice' plan, all 150 to 180 would be Negroes enrolling at Altheimer.  Overcrowding would be the result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  If overcrowding occurs, either individual white students will have to be assigned to Martin, one or more entire grades transferred to Martin, or the appellants' suggestion of using one site for elementary classes and the other for secondary classes adopted.  Any of the alternatives will be difficult, for there will be little, if any, time for planning and preparation.  This difficulty would have been avoided if the appellee School District based its construction plans on factors other than a desire to preserve a dual school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would add that the lower court should have recognized the problems inherent in the Board's construction plans and required them to be modified to meet constitutional standards.  Undue reliance on the 'deliberate speed' language in the Brown case, plus adherence to the dictum in Briggs, has resulted in a decision which makes it more difficult to achieve a non-racially operated school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that school construction is a proper matter for judicial consideration.  Wheeler v. Durham City Board of Education, 346 F.2d 768 (4th Cir. 1965); Board of Public Instruction of Duval County, Fla., et al. v. Braxton et al., supra, 326 F.2d at 620.  It is also clear that new school construction cannot be used to perpetuate segregation.  In Wheeler v. Durham City Board of Education, supra, 346 F.2d at 774, the Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'From remarks of the trial judge appearing in the record, we think he was fully aware of the possibility that a school construction program might be so directed as to perpetuate segregation. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying upon Wheeler, the District Court in Wright v. County School Board of Greenville County, Va., 252 F.Supp. 378, 384 (E.D.Va.1966) said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This court is loathe to enjoin the construction of any schools.  Virginia, in common with many other states, needs school facilities.  New construction, however, cannot be used to perpetuate segregation. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the construction of the new classrooms by the Board of Education had the effect of helping to perpetuate a segregated school system and should not have been permitted by the lower court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact remains, however, that error or no, new elementary classroom buildings have been constructed on the two sites and a plan which permits the best possible use of existing facilities in a constitutional manner must now be devised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">TRANSPORTATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board of Education transports rural students to and from their homes precisely as it did during the many years it operated a segregated school system.  It was inefficient and costly then.  It is just as inefficient and costly now.  Running two school buses down the same country road, one to pick up and deliver Martin students and the other to pick up and deliver next door neighbors attending Altheimer, is a Luxury that this impoverished school could not afford in the past and cannot afford now.  The difference is that, before Brown, the Board had the same right to operate segregated school buses as it had to operate segregated schools.  While we have no authority to strike down transportation systems because they are costly and inefficient, we must strike them down if their operation serves to discourage the desegregation of the school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been said that the school bus is a principal factor in perpetuating school segregation in many areas of the South.  See, United States et al. v. Macon County Board of Education et al., supra; Franklin v. Barbour County Board of Education, 259 F.Supp. 545 (M.D.Ala.1966); Harris v.Crenshaw County Board of Education, 259 F.Supp. 167 (M.D.Ala.1966); Carr v. Montgomery County Board of Education, 253 F.Supp. 306 (M.D.Ala.1966); Harris v. Bullock County Board of Education, 253 F.Supp. 276 (M.D.Ala.1966); Wright v. County School Board of Greenville County, 252 F.Supp. 378 (E.D.Va.1966); 53 Va.L.Rev.82 82 (1967); 1 Racial Isolation in the Public Schools, a report of the United States Commission on Civil Rights (1967), p. 67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reasoning compels a finding that the school bus is so being used here.  Neither students nor adults can be expected to interpret the Board's action in continuation of this expensive and inefficient system as being anything other than an act designed to maintain, insofar as it is possible, the segregated transportation of students.  While we approve, at this time, the right of students to select the school that they desire to attend, we do not approve of their right to select the bus in which they ride to school.  The appellee School District has an obligation to operate its buses on a non-racial basis and we do not believe it has done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not confronted here with a situation in which the appellee School District id being asked to bus children from one neighborhood to another to overcome the effects of defacto segregation, caused by racially segregated housing patterns, thus Downs v.

See 'SURVEY OF SCHOOL DESEGREGATION IN THE SOUTHERN AND BORDER STATES 1965-66,' United States Commission on Civil Rights (February 1966), at 29.  During hearings before the Special Subcommittee on Civil Rights of the House Judiciary Committee, in Washington, D.C., December 14, 15 and 16, 1966, Assistant Commissioner of Education David Seeley, head of the Equal Educational Opportunities Program, said he felt a sense of guilt that he and his staff had allowed the term 'freedom of choice' to be perpetuated since there was in no sense really a 'free choice' in an atmosphere of oppression.  He further pointed out that the choice invariably was between a 'Negro school' and a 'white school' rather than two typical community schools.  Commissioner of Education Harold Howe, II, obsrrved at these same hearings that such plans unfairly place the 'burden of desegregation' on Negro children and their parents, and are also 'not a good way to organize' school systems since they involve many elements of inconvenience and inefficiency.

These are: (1) by a desegregation order of a Federal Court, or (2) by a voluntary desegregation such as that adopted here.  Under the plan here, the School District must provide assurance that it will comply with applicable requirements and implement a desegregation plan to eliminate the dual school system and all other forms of discrimination as expeditiously as possible.  Specifically, the Board agrees to: (1) remove any segregation or other form of discrimination affecting students in connection with all services, facilities, activities and programs that may be conducted or sponsored by or affiliated with the schools of the system; (2) route and schedule transportation on the basis of such factors as enconomy and efficiency, and not so as to impede desegregation; (3) conduct special education programs without segregation; (4) take steps to encourage community support and prepare students, teachers and other personnel for the successful desegregation of the school system; and (5) within their authority, provide protection of persons exercising rights under the plan</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Tentative acceptance of the 'freedom of Choice' mothod for desegregation of public method for desegregation of public schools has been voiced by this Court.

School authorities who have heretofore operated dual school systems for Negroes and whites must assume the duty of eliminating the effects of dualism before a freedom of choice plan can be super-imposed upon the pre-existing situation and approved as a final plan of desegregation.  It is not enough to open the previously all-white schools to Negro students who desire to go there while all-Negro schools continue to be maintained as such.  Inevitably, Negro children will be encouraged to remain in 'their school,' built for Negroes and maintained for Negroes with all-Negro teachers and administrative personnel.  See Bradley v. School Bd. supra, 4 Cir., 345 F.2d at 324 (dissenting opinion).

In their Complaint, they asked for a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the Altheimer Public School District and the J. E. Stowers Construction Company from continuing plans to construct, and from constructing, separate elementary schools for white and Negro students.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> They also asked for a temporary and permanent injunction enjoining the School District from continuing the policy, practice, custom and usage of assigning pupils, faculty and administrative staff on a racially discriminatory basis and from continuing any policy or practice of racial discrimination in the operation of the Altheimer School District.  The case was argued before the Honorable J. Smith Henley, Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Pine Bluff Division, on March 31, 1966.  Judge Henley dismissed the Complaint in a momorandum decision handed down June 3, 1966.  The decision was subsequently appealed to this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Altheimer School District includes the town of Altheimer together with a substantial rural area of Jefferson County in the vicinity of the town.  It has a 67% Non-white population with a high concentration of poverty-stricken families-- a majority of whom are Negro.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The District could not be operated in its present manner without substantial federal funds.  In 1965-66, the District had a total enrollment of 1,408 students, of whom 741 were elementary students and 667 were junior and senior high students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the 1965-66 school year, the District maintained totally racially segregated schools.  Negro students were taught in a complex known as the Martin School, and white students in a complex known as the Altheimer School.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The two building complexes are within six blocks of each other.  Both sites serve students from grades one ghrough twelve.  About two-thirds of the students are transported to school by bus from outlying areas.  Each school operates its own bus system with the result that the bus routes are frequently duplicated.  The administrative staff of the District is entirely white except for the Negro principal of Martin High School.  The faculty, before 1965-66, was completely segregated, with white students taught only by white teachers and Negro students only by Negro teachers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the enactment of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the promulgation of guidelines by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (H.E.W.) implementing Title VI, the Altheimer School District submitted a voluntary plan of desegregation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> in April, 1965, which, after amendment, was finally approved by the Commissioner of Education and went into operation in September, 1965.  The plan adopted was the so-called 'freedom of choice'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> plan under which students may express choices for assignments to a particular school, the assignments to be honored as a matter of course unless they result in overcrowding.  In the event of overcrowding or a failure to exercise a choice, a student is supposed to be assigned to the school nearest his home where space is available.  All grades are afforded a choice each year.  The plan also requires the Board of Education to take affirmative steps to implement a desegregation plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the first year's operation of the 'freedom of choice' plan (1965-66), two Negro elementary students and four Negro high school students requested assignment to Altheimer.

See e.g., Kemp v. Beasley, supra; Clark v. Board of Education of Little Rock School Dist.,<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"273964\"><a href=\"/opinion/273964/delores-clark-v-the-board-of-education-of-the-little-rock-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span> (8th Cir. 1966).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thirdly, this Court has stated that it will rely heavily on H.E.W.

Clark v. Board of Education of Little Rock School Dist., supra 369 F.2d at 671.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellee School District will not be fully desegregated nor the appellants assured of their rights under the Constitution so long as the Martin School clearly remains identifiable as a Negro school.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment are not satisfied by having one segregated and one desegregated school in a District.  We are aware that it will be difficult to desegregate the Martin School.  However, while the Difficulties are perhaps largely traditional in nature, the Board of Education has taken no steps since Brown to attempt to change its identity from a racial to a non-racial school.  It has made no effort to employ or assign white faculty members to Martin, and it has maintained a transportation policy which encourages the identification of Martin as a Negro school.  It has even failed to provide the school with sufficient funds, resulting in heavier class loads for its teachers, inferior library facilities and a lower scholastic rating.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  The construction program, which served as the basis of the appellants' Complaint, emphasized the intention of the Board of Education to maintain a racially segregated school system.  Under such circumstances, it is understandable that no white students can be expected to transfer to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the light of this background, the appellants urge that the 'freedom of choice' plan cannot effectively desegregate the schools in this District.  They ask that we require the Board of Education to take action immediately to integrate all of the elementary classes at one site and the secondary classes at the other.  Though this solution has great appeal because of its simplicity, and obvious efficiency, we are not prepared to hold at this time, in view of our recent decisions in Smith v. Board of Education of Morrilton Sch. Dist. No. 32, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"273014\"><a href=\"/opinion/273014/clement-s-smith-and-the-arkansas-teachers-association-inc-and-margaret/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span> (8th Cir. 1966); Clark v. Board of Education of Little Rock, supra; and Kemp v.

In so solding, we make it clear, however, that we do not give our approval to the manner in which the Altheimer School District has met its responsibilities to desegregate the school system in the past, and we emphasize that if the plan is to be successful in the future, the Board of Education must remove every impediment to the exercise of a meaningful choice by students, and it must take action to eliminate those policies and practices which discourage the desegregation of the school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn then to consider the steps which must be taken by the appellee School District to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities, and to eliminate present obstacles to a 'free choice' by parents and students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">FACULTY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The faculty of the District is still largely segregated on the basis of race.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Not a single Negro serves as a classroom teacher in either the elementary or secondary white school.

While this may well be the most difficult problem in the desegregation process,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> it has been made more difficult by the failure of the Board to desegregate the faculties by filling vacancies on a non-racial basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot permit the difficulties involved in desegregating the faculties to deter us from achieving what the Constitution requires.  To facilitate faculty desegregation, we urge that the full understanding and cooperation of the Negro and white faculty be sought.

The planning for these classrooms proceeded on the basis that since the Martin and Altheimer Elementary Schools would continue to be segregated, a larger number of classrooms were needed for the Martin complex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Final action on construction was not taken until after April, 1965, at which time the Board decided to construct two new buildings, each containing eight elementary classrooms and related facilities at the Martin site, and a single building containing six elementary classrooms and related facilities at the Altheimer site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A school bond election was scheduled for September 28, 1965.  Prior to the election, one P.T.A. meeting was held at each school for discussion of the building program.  The 'Pine Bluff Commercial,' a newspaper of local distribution, carried stories of the construction plans in the July 22, September 26, and September 28, 1965, issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the bond election, a mimeographed notice urging parents to vote on the issue was sent home with the school child.  Proper legal notices of the election also appeared in the local newspapers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only 230 voters cast ballots in the election in which the bond issue was approved.  Following approval, the Board contracted with the J. E. Stowers Construction Company for building the facilities.  Five days after letting of the contract, the appellants filed the present suit to enjoin construction, contending that the building plan would tend to perpetuate racial segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The school superintendent testified that the Board (1) did not consider alternative building plans, (2) did not consider whether the construction would aid or hinder desegregation, and (3) was mainly concerned with the need to build the facilities.  He stated that by adopting the 'freedom of choice' plan, the Board had done all that was necessary to comply with the law.  He said that the Board would meet any problem of overcrowding when it arose but that at present, there was space for approximately sixty or seventy additional students at the Altheimer complex.  He indicated that if the number of applicants for either school exceeded available space, those pupils living nearest the overcrowded school would be assigned to it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' expert witness<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> stated that if the school construction was permitted as planned, segregation in the District would be prolonged.  He declared that there was no educational, financial, or other legitimate basis for the maintenance of two separate school complexes within such a small District or for additional construction of elementary buildings to serve two separate student bodies.  He maintained that the most practical way of eliminating segregation within the District would be to concentrate the elementary students at the Martin site and the secondary students at the Altheimer site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge rejected these arguments.  In dismissing the Complaint, he stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'If the defendant District can use freedom of choice, subject to the restrictions and requirements of the new guidelines, to bring about desegregation, as the Court holds that it can, there is no constitutional objection to the District's constructing buildings on both of its sites or on the Altheimer site.  As desegregation proceeds under the guidelines, it is clear that both sites will be used for the benefit of students of both races.  It must be remembered that when two school sites rather than one were established, the maintenance of dual school systems was generally if not universally considered to be constitutional, and there is nothing in the constitution which says that the District must now abandon one of its sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'As stated, the two sites are close together, and they can be used conveniently as components of the unitary school system which is now foreseeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The Court is not concerned here with whether it is wise or economical for the District to maintain the two sites or to construct elementary classroom buildings on both sites.  The Court is not convinced that in planning the new construction and in adhering to its plan following the passage of the Act the Board was motivated by a desire to perpetuate segregation, or that the effect of the construction will have that effect.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot agree with the reasons advanced by the trial court in support of its decision.  (1) The court's conclusion that both sites (unless clearly required) will be used for the benefit of both races is totally unsupported by the evidence and is contradicted by the court in its opinion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  (2) The District is not being asked to abandon one of its sites, but rather to use one site for an elementary school and the other for a secondary school.  (3) The testimony of the appellants that there was no economic or education justification for the Board's action stands virtually uncontradicted.  (4) The small vote on the bond election, the fact no survey of the Negro community was made, and the evidence that the Board never considered alternative plans which might have encouraged desegregation indicate to us a complete lack of community involvement in the decision to construct the new buildings, and a desire to retain the status quo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do the facts sustain the trial court's finding that the new buildings were not designed to perpetuate segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new buildings were the product of a ten-year building program begun when the District operated on a segregated basis.  The Board made no changes in the plans in response to the mandate of the Supreme Court in Brown or any subsequent decisions by either the Supreme Court or this Court.  Nor did the Civil Rights Act of 1964 cause the Board to alter its plans even though it finally agreed to desegregate the school system by indicating acceptance of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The traditional attendance patterns were assured by the addition of about twice the number of classrooms at the Negro site than at the white site, the ratio of classrooms to white and non-white students being 6/198 and 16/534, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court determined that if given a choice, white students would remain in an all-white school or a predominantly all-white school.  The superintendent's testimony indicates the Board was also aware of this axiom.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  Nevertheless, classroom space at the traditionally all-white Altheimer complex was limited to six classrooms.  This action sharply brough home to the Negro community the Board's expectation that their present and future children were to continue attending the traditionally all-Negro Martin School, and that there would not be room for them at Altheimer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Board limited the size of Altheimer Elementary School to the point where it is impossible for it to meet the standards established in the H.E.W. Guidelines.  Under the guidelines, an enrollment of from 150 to 180 students in a minority situation by the fall of 1967 would be deemed satisfactory progress.  Since no white students can be expected to request a transfer to Martin under the 'freedom of choice' plan, all 150 to 180 would be Negroes enrolling at Altheimer.  Overcrowding would be the result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  If overcrowding occurs, either individual white students will have to be assigned to Martin, one or more entire grades transferred to Martin, or the appellants' suggestion of using one site for elementary classes and the other for secondary classes adopted.  Any of the alternatives will be difficult, for there will be little, if any, time for planning and preparation.  This difficulty would have been avoided if the appellee School District based its construction plans on factors other than a desire to preserve a dual school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would add that the lower court should have recognized the problems inherent in the Board's construction plans and required them to be modified to meet constitutional standards.  Undue reliance on the 'deliberate speed' language in the Brown case, plus adherence to the dictum in Briggs, has resulted in a decision which makes it more difficult to achieve a non-racially operated school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that school construction is a proper matter for judicial consideration.

It was inefficient and costly then.  It is just as inefficient and costly now.  Running two school buses down the same country road, one to pick up and deliver Martin students and the other to pick up and deliver next door neighbors attending Altheimer, is a Luxury that this impoverished school could not afford in the past and cannot afford now.  The difference is that, before Brown, the Board had the same right to operate segregated school buses as it had to operate segregated schools.  While we have no authority to strike down transportation systems because they are costly and inefficient, we must strike them down if their operation serves to discourage the desegregation of the school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been said that the school bus is a principal factor in perpetuating school segregation in many areas of the South.

During hearings before the Special Subcommittee on Civil Rights of the House Judiciary Committee, in Washington, D.C., December 14, 15 and 16, 1966, Assistant Commissioner of Education David Seeley, head of the Equal Educational Opportunities Program, said he felt a sense of guilt that he and his staff had allowed the term 'freedom of choice' to be perpetuated since there was in no sense really a 'free choice' in an atmosphere of oppression.  He further pointed out that the choice invariably was between a 'Negro school' and a 'white school' rather than two typical community schools.  Commissioner of Education Harold Howe, II, obsrrved at these same hearings that such plans unfairly place the 'burden of desegregation' on Negro children and their parents, and are also 'not a good way to organize' school systems since they involve many elements of inconvenience and inefficiency.

It is not enough to open the previously all-white schools to Negro students who desire to go there while all-Negro schools continue to be maintained as such.  Inevitably, Negro children will be encouraged to remain in 'their school,' built for Negroes and maintained for Negroes with all-Negro teachers and administrative personnel.  See Bradley v.
