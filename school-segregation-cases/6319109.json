LICENSE\n\nSUSPENDED.\n\n\n\n      Charles L. Harrington and David J. Grace, Des Moines, for\n\ncomplainant.\n\n\n\n      Thomas G. Crabb, Des Moines, for respondent.\n\f                                     2\n\nCADY, Chief Justice.\n\n      The Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board charged\n\nRodney H. Powell with multiple violations of the Iowa Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct stemming from multiple trust fund infractions. A\n\ndivision of the Grievance Commission of the Supreme Court of Iowa\n\nfound Powell violated these rules and recommended that he receive a\n\npublic reprimand.    On our review of the commission’s report, we find\n\nPowell violated the rules of professional conduct. We suspend his license\n\nto practice law for a period of three months.\n      I. Factual Findings and Prior Proceedings.\n\n      Rodney Powell is an Iowa lawyer. He is sixty-six years old. Powell\n\nwas admitted to the Iowa bar in 1973, following his graduation from law\n\nschool, but did not begin practicing law in Iowa until 1988.      Powell\n\nserved in the Air Force until 1977 and was employed by a legal services\n\norganization in Missouri until he moved to Des Moines in 1988.        He\n\npracticed with a Des Moines firm after moving to Iowa until he opened\n\nhis own law firm in 1996. Powell worked mostly as a sole practitioner,\n\nbut employed associates for a period of time. He was disciplined in 2007\n\nfor a variety of unethical actions involved in the collection of fees. He\n\nreceived a private admonition in 2005 for charging an excessive fee and a\n\nprivate admonition in 2010 for failing to make an accounting before\n\nwithdrawing fees from his trust account.\n\n      In 2010, a bookkeeper with Powell’s law firm reported to the Board\n\nthat Powell was improperly using his office trust account. A subsequent\n\naudit revealed a trust account shortage. Additional audits also revealed\n\na shortage, and another office bookkeeper made another complaint to the\n\nBoard.\n\f                                    3\n\n      In response, we temporarily suspended Powell from the practice of\n\nlaw on October 21, 2011, and a trustee was appointed to take control of\n\nPowell’s trust account.   See Iowa Ct. R. 35.4.    The trustee ultimately\n\ndetermined the account was short approximately $43,000.         The Board\n\nfiled a complaint against Powell on February 28, 2012, alleging Powell\n\nviolated a variety of trust fund rules, including Iowa Rule of Professional\n\nConduct 32:1.15 (governing the safekeeping of property, including client\n\nfunds placed in a trust account), as well as Iowa Court Rules 45.1\n\n(imposing requirements for the maintenance of client trust accounts and\nthe deposit of funds), 45.2(2) (maintaining records, providing an\n\naccounting, and returning funds), and 45.7 (establishing rules governing\n\nadvance fees).\n\n      On March 21, 2012, Powell filed a petition to lift the temporary\n\nsuspension. He paid the shortage in his trust account by obtaining a\n\nloan and claimed the shortage resulted from sloppy procedures and\n\noversight.   Powell also submitted evidence that he had adopted\n\nsubstantial measures to avoid future trust accounting problems.        On\n\nMay 18, 2012, we lifted the temporary suspension order.\n\n      The complaint filed by the Board proceeded to a hearing before a\n\ndivision of the grievance commission. The evidence largely supported the\n\nallegations of the complaint.    From 2007 to 2011, Powell repeatedly\n\ndeposited client funds in the form of advance fees into the operating\n\naccount of the firm when the funds should have been deposited in the\n\ntrust account of the firm. While some of the misdirected funds were the\n\nresult of a temporary banking process that automatically deposited client\n\nfunds paid through a credit card into the firm operating account, Powell\n\nwas extremely slow to correct the problem. In fact, for the most part, he\n\nseemed to ignore it. Additionally, some of the mishandled fees were the\n\f                                     4\n\nresult of simple inattention, as well as purposeful actions by Powell.\n\nPowell also paid himself numerous legal fees before they were earned and\n\noften transferred funds from the trust account into the operating account\n\nwithout notice to the client and without an accompanying accounting of\n\nthe fee. These actions were frequently taken when Powell needed money\n\nfor the operating account. Powell compounded his trust fund problem by\n\nfailing to adequately manage the bookkeeping practices of the firm.\n\n         Powell also mishandled nonretainer-client funds. He once wrote a\n\ncheck from his trust account to purchase a bond on behalf of a client\nafter he deposited the client’s funds into his operating account. Another\n\ntime, he used a portion of client funds placed in his trust account for the\n\npurpose of paying a property settlement and the attorney fees of\n\nopposing counsel pursuant to a stipulated decree for dissolution of\n\nmarriage to pay his own attorney fees. Powell claimed he did not know\n\nthe funds were given to him by the client to pay the obligations under the\n\ndecree.     On occasions, Powell’s client trust account records showed\n\ncredits for client funds deposited in his operating account.     In short,\n\nPowell basically ignored the rules and procedures for maintaining a trust\n\naccount over a prolonged period of time.\n\n         Powell recently implemented corrective measures and now operates\n\nhis trust account in conformance with the required rules. He maintains\n\nconfidence in his current staff and has not had problems with his trust\n\naccount since his reinstatement.         No client suffered harm from his\n\nactions, and no clients filed a complaint against him for his conduct.\n\nPowell is nearing retirement and has performed a significant amount of\n\npro bono legal services for individuals and nonprofit companies over the\n\nyears.\n\f                                         5\n\n       The commission found Powell violated rule 32:1.15 by failing to\n\nsegregate trust funds into a separate trust account. It also found Powell\n\nviolated Iowa Court Rule 45.1 by failing to deposit client funds into his\n\ntrust account, violated court rule 45.2(2) by failing to maintain complete\n\ntrust account records and make full accountings,1 and violated court\n\nrule 45.7 by failing to notify clients of the withdrawal of advanced funds.\n\nBased largely on the seven-month interim suspension, the Board\n\nrecommended that Powell receive a public reprimand for his unethical\n\nconduct.\n       II. Scope of Review.\n\n       We review attorney disciplinary proceedings de novo.                    Iowa\n\nSupreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Casey, 761 N.W.2d 53, 55 (Iowa\n\n2009) (per curiam). The Board must prove disciplinary violations by a\n\nconvincing preponderance of the evidence.               Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y\n\nDisciplinary Bd. v. Conrad, 723 N.W.2d 791, 792 (Iowa 2006). We give\n\nrespectful      consideration     to    the     commission’s       findings     and\n\nrecommendations, but are not bound by them. Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y\n\nDisciplinary Bd. v. Wheeler, 824 N.W.2d 505, 509 (Iowa 2012).\n\n       III. Ethical Violations.\n\n       We agree with the commission that Powell violated rule 32:1.15,\n\nand the Iowa Court Rules governing trust funds. However, the evidence\n\nfailed to support a finding that Powell had no colorable claim to the\n\nfunds he removed from his trust account or failed to place in his trust\n\naccount. Instead, consistent with the charges brought by the Board, he\n\n       1Prior  to the date of Powell’s hearing, rule 45.2(2) was amended to provide\ngreater guidance to attorneys seeking to comply with trust accounting and record-\nkeeping requirements. Compare Iowa R. Prof’l Conduct 45.2(2) (2011), with Iowa R.\nProf’l Conduct 45.2(2)–(3) (2012).      Because Powell’s hearing occurred after the\namendment of the rule, we evaluate his alleged misconduct in light of subsections (2)\nand (3) of the current rule. See Iowa R. Prof’l Conduct 35.26.\n\f                                    6\n\nrepeatedly failed to comply with the rules and procedures governing trust\n\naccounts. The fighting question turns on the sanction that should result\n\nfrom the violations, largely in light of the temporary seven-month\n\nsuspension served by Powell prior to and during the pendency of this\n\nproceeding.\n\n      IV. Sanctions.\n\n      While we strive to achieve consistency in the discipline of Iowa\n\nlawyers who violate our rules of professional conduct, we also\n\nunderstand that the sanction to result in each individual case must rest\non its individual circumstances. See id. at 511; see also Iowa Supreme\n\nCt. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Earley, 729 N.W.2d 437, 443 (Iowa 2007). In\n\ndetermining the appropriate sanction, we are obligated to\n\n      “consider the nature of the violations, the attorney’s fitness\n      to continue in the practice of law, the protection of society\n      from those unfit to practice law, the need to uphold public\n      confidence in the justice system, deterrence, maintenance of\n      the reputation of the bar as a whole, and any aggravating or\n      mitigating circumstances.”\n\nWheeler, 824 N.W.2d at 511 (quoting Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary\n\nBd. v. Ireland, 748 N.W.2d 498, 502 (Iowa 2008)).\n\n      Broadly, this case involves conduct by a lawyer in improperly\n\nremoving client funds from a trust account and failing to deposit advance\n\nfees into the trust account. Within this broad category of conduct, we\n\nrecognize that a revocation normally results when the conduct of the\n\noffending lawyer constitutes conversion or theft. See Iowa Supreme Ct.\n\nBd. of Prof’l Ethics & Conduct v. Gottschalk, 553 N.W.2d 322, 325 (Iowa\n\n1996). For example, in Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board\n\nv. Reilly, 708 N.W.2d 82, 83, 85 (Iowa 2006), we revoked an attorney’s\n\nlicense to practice law, as opposed to imposing a suspension, for\n\nconverting $99,736.75 from his client trust account, which represented\n\f                                          7\n\nclient proceeds of a settlement claim on behalf of a minor child.2                We\n\nrecognized a consistent pattern in our cases over the years of imposing\n\nrevocation for the conversion of client funds. Id. at 84.\n\n       Yet, when the case involves client funds held as an advance fee\n\nand the conduct of the attorney involves the conversion of the funds\n\nbefore they were earned, we generally impose discipline in the form of a\n\nsuspension.     See id. (citing cases imposing a suspension for conduct\n\ninvolving client funds in which the attorney had a colorable future claim\n\nor did not take the funds for personal use).\n       While the conduct in both categories is serious, less serious\n\nsanctions    are   normally     appropriate     when     the   offending    conduct\n\nessentially involves a violation of our rule that fees paid in advance\n\ncannot normally be taken by a lawyer before the fee is earned. Id. This\n\nconduct also often spills into companion trust fund violations governing\n\nthe notice and accounting requirements that must accompany the\n\nwithdrawal of trust funds.        See Iowa Ct. R. 45.7.         Thus, we make a\n\ndistinction for purposes of sanctions between conduct involving trust\n\nfund violations and conduct in the nature of stealing.\n\n       2In Reilly, the attorney settled a claim of a minor child for $137,500. 708\nN.W.2d at 83. He received a settlement draft and deposited it in his firm’s trust\naccount. Id. Two checks were then written on the trust account to pay the attorney’s\ncontingent fee and the law firm’s expenses in pursuing the claim. Id. The amount that\nremained in the trust account—$99,736.75—was to be paid to a conservatorship\nestablished for the benefit of the minor child. Id. Instead, a few weeks later, Reilly\nwithdrew $9000 of the funds held for the child in the trust account by writing two\nchecks on the account. A few weeks later, he withdrew the remaining $90,736.75 by\nwriting one check on the trust account and depositing it in his personal bank account.\nId. The attorney was a gambling addict that left him in constant need of funds. Id. at\n85. He had no colorable claim to the funds removed from his trust account after his\nfees and expenses had been paid. Approximately eight months later, the attorney\nattempted to make reimbursement to the child by depositing the funds he had removed\nfrom the trust account into a conservatorship account managed by an investment firm.\nId. at 83. However, the transaction was accomplished through a check-kiting scheme\nthat ultimately victimized one of the banks he used to accomplish the scheme. Id. The\ncommission recommended a three-year suspension. Id. at 82.\n\f                                    8\n\n      The Board brought this case as a trust fund violation, primarily\n\ninvolving the taking of fees before they are earned.       Normally, this\n\nconduct supports a suspension ranging from a few months to a year or\n\nbeyond.   See Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Parrish, 801\n\nN.W.2d 580, 588–89 (Iowa 2011) (citing cases); Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y\n\nDisciplinary Bd. v. Isaacson, 750 N.W.2d 104, 109–10 (Iowa 2008); Iowa\n\nSupreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. McCann, 712 N.W.2d 89, 97 (Iowa\n\n2006) (citing cases).      The commission believed the seven-month\n\ntemporary suspension served by Powell in this case supports the\nimposition of a public reprimand.\n\n      Generally, prior discipline is considered to be an aggravating factor\n\nin determining the appropriate sanction.        Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y\n\nDisciplinary Bd. v. McCuskey, 814 N.W.2d 250, 258 (Iowa 2012).\n\nHowever, prior discipline is not an aggravating factor when it is\n\nintertwined in the current case. Id. Moreover, an interim suspension for\n\nconduct involved in a case can be considered as a mitigating factor in\n\ndetermining the length and adequacy of a suspension as a sanction in\n\nthe case. Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Conroy, 795 N.W.2d\n\n502, 506–07 (Iowa 2011).\n\n      This case has both aggravating and mitigating factors. Powell has\n\ncommitted unethical conduct in the past, but has also freely given his\n\ntime and professional assistance to nonprofit organizations and low-\n\nincome individuals in need of legal assistance.    Additionally, no client\n\nfunds were lost in this case, and Powell’s trust accounting records and\n\nprocedures appear to be in good order. We have recognized these factors\n\nin mitigation of discipline in the past. Gottschalk, 553 N.W.2d at 325.\n\n      Considering all the factors and circumstances, we conclude Powell\n\nshould be suspended for a period of three months. While the interim\n\f                                     9\n\nseven-month suspension weighs heavily in this case as recognized by the\n\ncommission, so do the years of utter disregard by Powell for the trust\n\nfund rules and practices.    Having considered the length and extent of\n\nPowell’s unethical conduct and his prolonged indifference to the ethical\n\nrequirements of collecting and maintaining advance fees, the seven-\n\nmonth interim suspension that was imposed in this case to promptly\n\nprotect the public and straighten out his accounting records is\n\ninsufficient to meet the goals and purposes of discipline. Powell engaged\n\nin conduct that displayed contempt for our rules governing trust\naccounts and placed client funds at risk. His conduct also diminished\n\nthe honor and integrity of our profession.     The public understandably\n\nloses trust in the profession when lawyers fail to properly protect funds\n\nrequired to be held in trust.      In the end, an additional period of\n\nsuspension is needed to uphold public confidence in the justice system\n\nand maintain the reputation of the bar. See Wheeler, 824 N.W.2d at 511.\n\n      V. Conclusion.\n\n      We suspend Powell’s license to practice law in this state with no\n\npossibility of reinstatement for three months from the date of the filing of\n\nthis opinion. This suspension shall apply to all facets of the practice of\n\nlaw. Iowa Ct. R. 35.13(3).\n\n      Upon application for reinstatement, Powell shall have the burden\n\nto show he has not practiced law during the period of suspension and\n\nthat he meets the requirements of Iowa Court Rule 35.14. The costs of\n\nthis proceeding are assessed against Powell pursuant to rule 35.27(1).\n\n      LICENSE SUSPENDED.\n\n      All justices concur except Wiggins, J., who dissents.\n\f                                    10\n\n              #12–1516, Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Powell\n\nWIGGINS, Justice (dissenting).\n\n      The majority characterizes Powell’s misconduct as accounting\n\nerrors and that any monies Powell used from his trust account were\n\nunearned   fees.    This   characterization   is   contrary   to   both   the\n\ncommission’s findings and the record. Some of the funds in the trust\n\naccount were not advances for fees he was going to earn in the future.\n\nFor example, in the representation of Belden, Powell received a credit\n\ncard payment from Belden’s parents totaling $26,000 to cover the\nretainer fee and bond money for their son’s representation. Powell never\n\nhad a colorable claim to the bond money.\n\n      In the Linder matter, Linder provided Powell’s associate, Katherine\n\nDaman, who was handling his dissolution of marriage case, with the sum\n\nof $39,990 for disbursement to Linder’s ex-wife. Pursuant to the terms\n\nof the property settlement in the dissolution decree, Linder was required\n\nto pay his ex-wife’s legal fees. Of the $39,990 Powell received to transmit\n\nto Linder’s ex-wife, Powell only transferred $25,000.\n\n      In other words, Powell’s alleged accounting errors caused him to\n\nuse client’s money, of which he had no colorable claim, to support his\n\nlaw office. We have previously characterized this conduct as conversion.\n\nSee, e.g., Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Adams, 809 N.W.2d\n\n543, 545–46 (Iowa 2012) (revoking the license of an attorney who had no\n\ncolorable future claim to client funds taken on two occasions); Iowa\n\nSupreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Wengert, 790 N.W.2d 94, 102–03\n\n(Iowa 2010) (revoking the license of an attorney who misappropriated\n\nclient funds and had no colorable claim to the monies); Iowa Supreme Ct.\n\nAtt’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Earley, 774 N.W.2d 301, 308–09 (Iowa 2009)\n\n(revoking the license of an attorney who had no colorable claim to\n\f                                    11\n\n$32,500 in client funds that disappeared from the client trust account);\n\nIowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Reilly, 708 N.W.2d 82, 84–85\n\n(Iowa 2006) (revoking the license of an attorney who established a check-\n\nkiting scheme to misappropriate client funds to which he had no\n\ncolorable future claim). Therefore, it is improper for the court to adopt a\n\nrule distinguishing between conduct involving trust fund violations and\n\nconduct characterized as stealing. Our jurisprudence demonstrates that\n\nsuch conduct can be, and often is, one in the same. An attorney can\n\nsteal just as easily by cooking the books as by directly tapping into a\nclient’s bank account.     We should not reward with leniency those\n\nattorneys who steal by devising evasive accounting practices, while\n\nsimultaneously imposing the harshest discipline on attorneys who steal\n\nclient monies through more transparent means.        Call it by any other\n\nname, but stealing is stealing.\n\n      Through electronic fund transfers, Powell automatically deposited\n\nthese unearned fees and money belonging to clients in the firm’s\n\noperating account.    He did not timely (and in some instances, ever)\n\ntransfer those monies from the firm’s operating account to the trust\n\naccount.   Although funds did not always transfer from the operating\n\naccount to the trust account, Powell frequently would award a client a\n\ntrust account balance, which created the illusion that the account\n\ncontained the advance fee deposit. When a client’s advance fee and other\n\nfunds belonging to a client remained in the firm’s operating account,\n\nPowell still wrote trust account checks on behalf of that client.      The\n\nresult of this accounting scheme was that eleven to twelve of his clients\n\nhad negative balances in the trust account. Powell does not dispute this.\n\n      Most seriously, Powell’s bookkeeper, Leslie Hudson, testified that\n\nwhenever Powell needed money for the firm’s operating account, he\n\f                                  12\n\nwould dip into the trust money.        Powell acknowledged in his own\n\ntestimony that he used the trust account funds, consisting of advance\n\nfees and money belonging to the clients, in the operating account to pay\n\nfirm bills. Moreover, Powell’s bookkeeper tried to remedy the problem,\n\nbut Powell refused to do so. On several occasions, Powell’s bookkeeper\n\nattempted to have Powell sign a check to transfer the money to the trust\n\naccount, but Powell made excuses and ultimately did not sign the check.\n\n      Another telling sign that Powell was knowingly using client funds\n\nfor his own use was his response to the various audits conducted by the\nClient Security Commission.     In 2006, the commission audited his\n\naccounts and gave him a clean bill of health on his books. This baseline\n\nestablishes that he knew how to properly handle client funds and not\n\nuse such monies for his own purposes.         After the first audit, the\n\ncommission found:\n\n            He first came to the attention of the Client Security\n      Commission (Commission) regarding trust account issues in\n      approximately November 2009. Mary Kaye Gooding, his\n      bookkeeper at that time, called the Commission and stated\n      that Powell was not handling his trust account properly.\n\n            Successive audits by Commission auditor Allen Davey\n      followed.    Davey testified—and Exhibits 1 and 26\n      substantiate—that as of August 31, 2010, Powell had a\n      shortage of approximately $20,000 in his trust account. An\n      updated audit conducted four months later revealed a\n      $16,000 shortage as of December 31, 2010. A supplemental\n      audit as of August 21, 2011, placed the shortage at\n      approximately $34,778.28.\n\n             In mid-2011, Denise Dooley—who was briefly one of\n      Powell’s bookkeepers—called the Commission to again report\n      ongoing issues with Powell’s trust accounts. That prompted\n      the Office of Professional Regulation to ask the Board to\n      petition the Court and request an interim suspension of\n      Powell    under   Attorney    Discipline,  Disability, and\n      Reinstatement Rule 35.4.\n\f                                     13\n            ....\n\n           The Court ordered Fifth Judicial District Chief Judge\n      Arthur E. Gamble to appoint a trustee for Powell’s trust\n      account. Judge Gamble appointed practicing attorney, part-\n      time magistrate, and experienced trustee Jeffrey Lipman\n      (Lipman) to take control of the account.\n\n            Lipman verified that the amount due and owing to the\n      trust account was now somewhere between $42,000 and\n      $44,000.\n\n(Citations omitted.)\n\n      I can believe that accounting errors may have caused the first\n\naudit after 2006 to reveal bookkeeping issues.     Nevertheless, after the\n\nfirst audit brought these accounting problems to his attention, Powell\n\ncontinued to use client funds for his own personal use. The state of his\n\nfinancial affairs was so bad that his own bookkeeper had to report him,\n\nand we temporarily suspended his license. In the end, he used between\n\n$42,000 and $44,000 of trust funds for his own use. That means he\n\nconverted more than $20,000 in client funds for his own purposes,\n\nbecause the first audit already revealed a $20,000 shortfall.    I cannot\n\nattribute this additional conversion to mere accounting problems.\n\n      In the end, the commission made the finding that “Powell indirectly\n\nconcedes that client money repeatedly went in the firm operating account\n\nand was used to pay bills when it should have been deposited into the\n\ntrust account.” The commission also found: “One witness testified that\n\nwhen Powell needed money for the firm’s operating account he would\n\ntransfer the trust money of certain clients. Powell in large corroborated\n\ntheir testimony.”      This is a clear admission and finding that Powell\n\nintentionally converted clients’ funds for his own use.\n\n      As to the automatic deposit issue regarding credit card charges,\n\nthe commission made the following finding:\n\f                                    14\n             Powell’s former employees also testified that when they\n      made Powell aware of the credit card automatic deposit\n      issue, he failed to diligently follow up with the bank to get\n      the problem corrected. In responding to these allegations\n      Powell alternatively claims (1) the bank where the firm’s\n      credit card account was set up to not have the technology to\n      credit advance payment to the firm’s trust account, and (2)\n      the bank would not get back to him with answers when he\n      contacted it with questions about directing automatic fund\n      deposits.\n\n            The Division finds the employee testimony on this\n      allegation more credible than Powell’s. Once Powell was\n      aware that the credit card, electronic fund transfers were\n      automatically depositing in the firm operating account\n      instead of in the firm trust account, he was obligated to\n      properly stop the bleeding. He did not and he offers no\n      credible justification for any delay in fixing the problem.\n\n(Citations omitted.)\n\n      The logical explanation for his delay in fixing the problem is that\n\nhe needed the money to operate his law office.         As the commission\n\ndetermined, Powell hid all his transgressions from his clients by routinely\n\ntransferring trust account money “to the firm operating account without\n\nnotice to the affected client . . . of what fees were earned, when they were\n\nearned, and why they were earned.” The commission further found that\n\nthe facts supporting the allegation that Powell converted client funds to\n\npay office expenses “are overwhelming.”\n\n      Accordingly, on this record, I would agree with the commission’s\n\nfindings and make the factual finding that Powell knowingly converted\n\nclients’ funds to his own use.    Although some of the funds that were\n\nconverted may have been for advanced fees, some of the money belonged\n\nto his clients to pay third parties. His actions constitute theft as defined\n\nby the Code, which provides in relevant part:\n\n             A person commits theft when the person does any of\n      the following:\n\n            ....\n\f                                    15\n             2. Misappropriates property which the person has in\n      trust, or property of another which the person has in the\n      person’s possession or control, whether such possession or\n      control is lawful or unlawful, by using or disposing of it in a\n      manner which is inconsistent with or a denial of the trust or\n      of the owner’s rights in such property, or conceals found\n      property, or appropriates such property to the person’s own\n      use, when the owner of such property is known to the\n      person.\n\nIowa Code § 714.1(2) (2011).\n\n      We revoke the license of attorneys who misappropriate funds from\n\ntheir clients. See, e.g., Adams, 809 N.W.2d at 546; Wengert, 790 N.W.2d\n\nat 104; Earley, 774 N.W.2d at 308–09; Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y\n\nDisciplinary Bd. v.

Bd. of\n\nProf’l Ethics & Conduct v. Lett, 674 N.W.2d 139, 144–45 (Iowa 2004);\n\nIowa Supreme Ct. Bd. of Prof’l Ethics & Conduct v. Leon, 602 N.W.2d 336,\n\n339 (Iowa 1999).\n\n      In one of these cases where we revoked an attorney’s license, the\n\nattorney, Reilly, withdrew money from the client trust account over a\n\ntwo-month period and used it for his own personal use.         Reilly, 708\n\nN.W.2d at 83. Months later, Reilly made restitution of the funds, and\n\nthere was no harm to the client. Id. There, we found Reilly violated the\n\nsame trust account rules as the majority finds Powell did. Id. at 84. The\n\ncommission only recommended a suspension. Id. at 82. In response to\n\nthat recommendation, we reaffirmed our position that we are free to\n\nimpose a lesser or greater suspension than recommended by the\n\ncommission.    Id. at 84.   We examined the caselaw and determined\n\nmisappropriation of a client’s funds by itself warrants a revocation of an\n\nattorney’s license. Id. In another recent case, we revoked the license of\n\f                                     16\n\nan attorney, Adams, who disbursed trust account funds to himself on\n\ntwo occasions, without having a colorable claim to the funds and used\n\nthose client funds for his own purposes. Adams, 809 N.W.2d at 545–46.\n\nYet another example involved an attorney who was holding funds for a\n\nclient to settle a real estate matter and misappropriated the funds from\n\nthe trust account to be used in the real estate transaction for her own\n\nuse. Lett, 674 N.W.2d at 142, 144–45.\n\n      Powell’s conduct in this case is no different from Reilly’s, Adams’,\n\nand Lett’s conduct. He used funds in the trust account that clients gave\nto him to pay third parties. As I previously stated:\n\n      We, as a court and as the regulatory body for our profession,\n      have an obligation to protect the public from dishonest\n      attorneys. I echo the beginning of this dissent—dishonesty\n      is a trait that disqualifies a person from the practice of law. A\n      person who uses his law license to steal money or aids\n      another to do so is per se unfit to practice law. Cases like\n      this give the public the perception that a license to practice\n      law is a license to steal.\n\nIowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Bieber, 824 N.W.2d 514, 534\n\n(Iowa 2012) (Wiggins, J., dissenting).\n\n      Accordingly, I would revoke Powell’s license.\n\f",

Powell with multiple violations of the Iowa Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct stemming from multiple trust fund infractions. A\n\ndivision of the Grievance Commission of the Supreme Court of Iowa\n\nfound Powell violated these rules and recommended that he receive a\n\npublic reprimand.    On our review of the commission’s report, we find\n\nPowell violated the rules of professional conduct. We suspend his license\n\nto practice law for a period of three months.\n      I. Factual Findings and Prior Proceedings.\n\n      Rodney Powell is an Iowa lawyer. He is sixty-six years old. Powell\n\nwas admitted to the Iowa bar in 1973, following his graduation from law\n\nschool, but did not begin practicing law in Iowa until 1988.      Powell\n\nserved in the Air Force until 1977 and was employed by a legal services\n\norganization in Missouri until he moved to Des Moines in 1988.        He\n\npracticed with a Des Moines firm after moving to Iowa until he opened\n\nhis own law firm in 1996. Powell worked mostly as a sole practitioner,\n\nbut employed associates for a period of time. He was disciplined in 2007\n\nfor a variety of unethical actions involved in the collection of fees. He\n\nreceived a private admonition in 2005 for charging an excessive fee and a\n\nprivate admonition in 2010 for failing to make an accounting before\n\nwithdrawing fees from his trust account.\n\n      In 2010, a bookkeeper with Powell’s law firm reported to the Board\n\nthat Powell was improperly using his office trust account. A subsequent\n\naudit revealed a trust account shortage. Additional audits also revealed\n\na shortage, and another office bookkeeper made another complaint to the\n\nBoard.\n\f                                    3\n\n      In response, we temporarily suspended Powell from the practice of\n\nlaw on October 21, 2011, and a trustee was appointed to take control of\n\nPowell’s trust account.   See Iowa Ct. R. 35.4.    The trustee ultimately\n\ndetermined the account was short approximately $43,000.         The Board\n\nfiled a complaint against Powell on February 28, 2012, alleging Powell\n\nviolated a variety of trust fund rules, including Iowa Rule of Professional\n\nConduct 32:1.15 (governing the safekeeping of property, including client\n\nfunds placed in a trust account), as well as Iowa Court Rules 45.1\n\n(imposing requirements for the maintenance of client trust accounts and\nthe deposit of funds), 45.2(2) (maintaining records, providing an\n\naccounting, and returning funds), and 45.7 (establishing rules governing\n\nadvance fees).\n\n      On March 21, 2012, Powell filed a petition to lift the temporary\n\nsuspension. He paid the shortage in his trust account by obtaining a\n\nloan and claimed the shortage resulted from sloppy procedures and\n\noversight.   Powell also submitted evidence that he had adopted\n\nsubstantial measures to avoid future trust accounting problems.        On\n\nMay 18, 2012, we lifted the temporary suspension order.\n\n      The complaint filed by the Board proceeded to a hearing before a\n\ndivision of the grievance commission. The evidence largely supported the\n\nallegations of the complaint.    From 2007 to 2011, Powell repeatedly\n\ndeposited client funds in the form of advance fees into the operating\n\naccount of the firm when the funds should have been deposited in the\n\ntrust account of the firm. While some of the misdirected funds were the\n\nresult of a temporary banking process that automatically deposited client\n\nfunds paid through a credit card into the firm operating account, Powell\n\nwas extremely slow to correct the problem. In fact, for the most part, he\n\nseemed to ignore it. Additionally, some of the mishandled fees were the\n\f                                     4\n\nresult of simple inattention, as well as purposeful actions by Powell.\n\nPowell also paid himself numerous legal fees before they were earned and\n\noften transferred funds from the trust account into the operating account\n\nwithout notice to the client and without an accompanying accounting of\n\nthe fee. These actions were frequently taken when Powell needed money\n\nfor the operating account. Powell compounded his trust fund problem by\n\nfailing to adequately manage the bookkeeping practices of the firm.\n\n         Powell also mishandled nonretainer-client funds. He once wrote a\n\ncheck from his trust account to purchase a bond on behalf of a client\nafter he deposited the client’s funds into his operating account. Another\n\ntime, he used a portion of client funds placed in his trust account for the\n\npurpose of paying a property settlement and the attorney fees of\n\nopposing counsel pursuant to a stipulated decree for dissolution of\n\nmarriage to pay his own attorney fees. Powell claimed he did not know\n\nthe funds were given to him by the client to pay the obligations under the\n\ndecree.     On occasions, Powell’s client trust account records showed\n\ncredits for client funds deposited in his operating account.     In short,\n\nPowell basically ignored the rules and procedures for maintaining a trust\n\naccount over a prolonged period of time.\n\n         Powell recently implemented corrective measures and now operates\n\nhis trust account in conformance with the required rules. He maintains\n\nconfidence in his current staff and has not had problems with his trust\n\naccount since his reinstatement.         No client suffered harm from his\n\nactions, and no clients filed a complaint against him for his conduct.\n\nPowell is nearing retirement and has performed a significant amount of\n\npro bono legal services for individuals and nonprofit companies over the\n\nyears.\n\f                                         5\n\n       The commission found Powell violated rule 32:1.15 by failing to\n\nsegregate trust funds into a separate trust account. It also found Powell\n\nviolated Iowa Court Rule 45.1 by failing to deposit client funds into his\n\ntrust account, violated court rule 45.2(2) by failing to maintain complete\n\ntrust account records and make full accountings,1 and violated court\n\nrule 45.7 by failing to notify clients of the withdrawal of advanced funds.\n\nBased largely on the seven-month interim suspension, the Board\n\nrecommended that Powell receive a public reprimand for his unethical\n\nconduct.\n       II. Scope of Review.\n\n       We review attorney disciplinary proceedings de novo.                    Iowa\n\nSupreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1991244\"><a href=\"/opinion/1991244/iowa-supreme-court-atty-disciplinary-bd-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 55 (Iowa\n\n2009) (per curiam). The Board must prove disciplinary violations by a\n\nconvincing preponderance of the evidence.               Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y\n\nDisciplinary Bd. v. Conrad, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1929751\"><a href=\"/opinion/1929751/iowa-supreme-ct-atty-disc-bd-v-conrad/\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 792 (Iowa 2006). We give\n\nrespectful      consideration     to    the     commission’s       findings     and\n\nrecommendations, but are not bound by them. Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y\n\nDisciplinary Bd. v. Wheeler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 509 (Iowa 2012).\n\n       III. Ethical Violations.\n\n       We agree with the commission that Powell violated rule 32:1.15,\n\nand the Iowa Court Rules governing trust funds. However, the evidence\n\nfailed to support a finding that Powell had no colorable claim to the\n\nfunds he removed from his trust account or failed to place in his trust\n\naccount. Instead, consistent with the charges brought by the Board, he\n\n       1Prior  to the date of Powell’s hearing, rule 45.2(2) was amended to provide\ngreater guidance to attorneys seeking to comply with trust accounting and record-\nkeeping requirements. Compare Iowa R. Prof’l Conduct 45.2(2) (2011), with Iowa R.\nProf’l Conduct 45.2(2)–(3) (2012).      Because Powell’s hearing occurred after the\namendment of the rule, we evaluate his alleged misconduct in light of subsections (2)\nand (3) of the current rule. See Iowa R. Prof’l Conduct 35.26.\n\f                                    6\n\nrepeatedly failed to comply with the rules and procedures governing trust\n\naccounts. The fighting question turns on the sanction that should result\n\nfrom the violations, largely in light of the temporary seven-month\n\nsuspension served by Powell prior to and during the pendency of this\n\nproceeding.\n\n      IV. Sanctions.\n\n      While we strive to achieve consistency in the discipline of Iowa\n\nlawyers who violate our rules of professional conduct, we also\n\nunderstand that the sanction to result in each individual case must rest\non its individual circumstances. See id. at 511; see also Iowa Supreme\n\nCt. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Earley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1811622\"><a href=\"/opinion/1811622/ia-supreme-court-atty-disc-bd-v-earley/\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 443 (Iowa 2007). In\n\ndetermining the appropriate sanction, we are obligated to\n\n      “consider the nature of the violations, the attorney’s fitness\n      to continue in the practice of law, the protection of society\n      from those unfit to practice law, the need to uphold public\n      confidence in the justice system, deterrence, maintenance of\n      the reputation of the bar as a whole, and any aggravating or\n      mitigating circumstances.”\n\nWheeler, 824 N.W.2d at 511 (quoting Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary\n\nBd. v. Ireland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2141305\"><a href=\"/opinion/2141305/ia-s-ct-atty-disciplinary-bd-v-ireland/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 502 (Iowa 2008)).\n\n      Broadly, this case involves conduct by a lawyer in improperly\n\nremoving client funds from a trust account and failing to deposit advance\n\nfees into the trust account. Within this broad category of conduct, we\n\nrecognize that a revocation normally results when the conduct of the\n\noffending lawyer constitutes conversion or theft. See Iowa Supreme Ct.\n\nBd. of Prof’l Ethics & Conduct v. Gottschalk, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1857752\"><a href=\"/opinion/1857752/iowa-supreme-court-bd-v-gottschalk/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 325 (Iowa\n\n1996). For example, in Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board\n\nv. Reilly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1313698\"><a href=\"/opinion/1313698/iowa-supreme-ct-atty-disc-bd-v-reilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 83, 85 (Iowa 2006), we revoked an attorney’s\n\nlicense to practice law, as opposed to imposing a suspension, for\n\nconverting $99,736.75 from his client trust account, which represented\n\f                                          7\n\nclient proceeds of a settlement claim on behalf of a minor child.2                We\n\nrecognized a consistent pattern in our cases over the years of imposing\n\nrevocation for the conversion of client funds. Id. at 84.\n\n       Yet, when the case involves client funds held as an advance fee\n\nand the conduct of the attorney involves the conversion of the funds\n\nbefore they were earned, we generally impose discipline in the form of a\n\nsuspension.     See id. (citing cases imposing a suspension for conduct\n\ninvolving client funds in which the attorney had a colorable future claim\n\nor did not take the funds for personal use).\n       While the conduct in both categories is serious, less serious\n\nsanctions    are   normally     appropriate     when     the   offending    conduct\n\nessentially involves a violation of our rule that fees paid in advance\n\ncannot normally be taken by a lawyer before the fee is earned. Id. This\n\nconduct also often spills into companion trust fund violations governing\n\nthe notice and accounting requirements that must accompany the\n\nwithdrawal of trust funds.        See Iowa Ct. R. 45.7.         Thus, we make a\n\ndistinction for purposes of sanctions between conduct involving trust\n\nfund violations and conduct in the nature of stealing.\n\n       2In Reilly, the attorney settled a claim of a minor child for $137,500. 708\nN.W.2d at 83. He received a settlement draft and deposited it in his firm’s trust\naccount. Id. Two checks were then written on the trust account to pay the attorney’s\ncontingent fee and the law firm’s expenses in pursuing the claim. Id. The amount that\nremained in the trust account—$99,736.75—was to be paid to a conservatorship\nestablished for the benefit of the minor child. Id. Instead, a few weeks later, Reilly\nwithdrew $9000 of the funds held for the child in the trust account by writing two\nchecks on the account. A few weeks later, he withdrew the remaining $90,736.75 by\nwriting one check on the trust account and depositing it in his personal bank account.\nId. The attorney was a gambling addict that left him in constant need of funds. Id. at\n85. He had no colorable claim to the funds removed from his trust account after his\nfees and expenses had been paid. Approximately eight months later, the attorney\nattempted to make reimbursement to the child by depositing the funds he had removed\nfrom the trust account into a conservatorship account managed by an investment firm.\nId. at 83. However, the transaction was accomplished through a check-kiting scheme\nthat ultimately victimized one of the banks he used to accomplish the scheme. Id. The\ncommission recommended a three-year suspension. Id. at 82.\n\f                                    8\n\n      The Board brought this case as a trust fund violation, primarily\n\ninvolving the taking of fees before they are earned.       Normally, this\n\nconduct supports a suspension ranging from a few months to a year or\n\nbeyond.   See Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v.

The commission believed the seven-month\n\ntemporary suspension served by Powell in this case supports the\nimposition of a public reprimand.\n\n      Generally, prior discipline is considered to be an aggravating factor\n\nin determining the appropriate sanction.        Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y\n\nDisciplinary Bd. v. McCuskey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 (Iowa 2012).\n\nHowever, prior discipline is not an aggravating factor when it is\n\nintertwined in the current case. Id. Moreover, an interim suspension for\n\nconduct involved in a case can be considered as a mitigating factor in\n\ndetermining the length and adequacy of a suspension as a sanction in\n\nthe case. Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Conroy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">502</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506–07 (Iowa 2011).\n\n      This case has both aggravating and mitigating factors. Powell has\n\ncommitted unethical conduct in the past, but has also freely given his\n\ntime and professional assistance to nonprofit organizations and low-\n\nincome individuals in need of legal assistance.    Additionally, no client\n\nfunds were lost in this case, and Powell’s trust accounting records and\n\nprocedures appear to be in good order. We have recognized these factors\n\nin mitigation of discipline in the past. Gottschalk, 553 N.W.2d at 325.\n\n      Considering all the factors and circumstances, we conclude Powell\n\nshould be suspended for a period of three months. While the interim\n\f                                     9\n\nseven-month suspension weighs heavily in this case as recognized by the\n\ncommission, so do the years of utter disregard by Powell for the trust\n\nfund rules and practices.    Having considered the length and extent of\n\nPowell’s unethical conduct and his prolonged indifference to the ethical\n\nrequirements of collecting and maintaining advance fees, the seven-\n\nmonth interim suspension that was imposed in this case to promptly\n\nprotect the public and straighten out his accounting records is\n\ninsufficient to meet the goals and purposes of discipline. Powell engaged\n\nin conduct that displayed contempt for our rules governing trust\naccounts and placed client funds at risk. His conduct also diminished\n\nthe honor and integrity of our profession.     The public understandably\n\nloses trust in the profession when lawyers fail to properly protect funds\n\nrequired to be held in trust.      In the end, an additional period of\n\nsuspension is needed to uphold public confidence in the justice system\n\nand maintain the reputation of the bar. See Wheeler, 824 N.W.2d at 511.\n\n      V. Conclusion.\n\n      We suspend Powell’s license to practice law in this state with no\n\npossibility of reinstatement for three months from the date of the filing of\n\nthis opinion. This suspension shall apply to all facets of the practice of\n\nlaw. Iowa Ct. R. 35.13(3).\n\n      Upon application for reinstatement, Powell shall have the burden\n\nto show he has not practiced law during the period of suspension and\n\nthat he meets the requirements of Iowa Court Rule 35.14. The costs of\n\nthis proceeding are assessed against Powell pursuant to rule 35.27(1).\n\n      LICENSE SUSPENDED.\n\n      All justices concur except Wiggins, J., who dissents.\n\f                                    10\n\n              #12–1516, Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Powell\n\nWIGGINS, Justice (dissenting).\n\n      The majority characterizes Powell’s misconduct as accounting\n\nerrors and that any monies Powell used from his trust account were\n\nunearned   fees.    This   characterization   is   contrary   to   both   the\n\ncommission’s findings and the record. Some of the funds in the trust\n\naccount were not advances for fees he was going to earn in the future.\n\nFor example, in the representation of Belden, Powell received a credit\n\ncard payment from Belden’s parents totaling $26,000 to cover the\nretainer fee and bond money for their son’s representation. Powell never\n\nhad a colorable claim to the bond money.\n\n      In the Linder matter, Linder provided Powell’s associate, Katherine\n\nDaman, who was handling his dissolution of marriage case, with the sum\n\nof $39,990 for disbursement to Linder’s ex-wife. Pursuant to the terms\n\nof the property settlement in the dissolution decree, Linder was required\n\nto pay his ex-wife’s legal fees. Of the $39,990 Powell received to transmit\n\nto Linder’s ex-wife, Powell only transferred $25,000.\n\n      In other words, Powell’s alleged accounting errors caused him to\n\nuse client’s money, of which he had no colorable claim, to support his\n\nlaw office. We have previously characterized this conduct as conversion.\n\nSee, e.g., Iowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v.

Therefore, it is improper for the court to adopt a\n\nrule distinguishing between conduct involving trust fund violations and\n\nconduct characterized as stealing. Our jurisprudence demonstrates that\n\nsuch conduct can be, and often is, one in the same. An attorney can\n\nsteal just as easily by cooking the books as by directly tapping into a\nclient’s bank account.     We should not reward with leniency those\n\nattorneys who steal by devising evasive accounting practices, while\n\nsimultaneously imposing the harshest discipline on attorneys who steal\n\nclient monies through more transparent means.        Call it by any other\n\nname, but stealing is stealing.\n\n      Through electronic fund transfers, Powell automatically deposited\n\nthese unearned fees and money belonging to clients in the firm’s\n\noperating account.    He did not timely (and in some instances, ever)\n\ntransfer those monies from the firm’s operating account to the trust\n\naccount.   Although funds did not always transfer from the operating\n\naccount to the trust account, Powell frequently would award a client a\n\ntrust account balance, which created the illusion that the account\n\ncontained the advance fee deposit. When a client’s advance fee and other\n\nfunds belonging to a client remained in the firm’s operating account,\n\nPowell still wrote trust account checks on behalf of that client.      The\n\nresult of this accounting scheme was that eleven to twelve of his clients\n\nhad negative balances in the trust account. Powell does not dispute this.\n\n      Most seriously, Powell’s bookkeeper, Leslie Hudson, testified that\n\nwhenever Powell needed money for the firm’s operating account, he\n\f                                  12\n\nwould dip into the trust money.        Powell acknowledged in his own\n\ntestimony that he used the trust account funds, consisting of advance\n\nfees and money belonging to the clients, in the operating account to pay\n\nfirm bills. Moreover, Powell’s bookkeeper tried to remedy the problem,\n\nbut Powell refused to do so. On several occasions, Powell’s bookkeeper\n\nattempted to have Powell sign a check to transfer the money to the trust\n\naccount, but Powell made excuses and ultimately did not sign the check.\n\n      Another telling sign that Powell was knowingly using client funds\n\nfor his own use was his response to the various audits conducted by the\nClient Security Commission.     In 2006, the commission audited his\n\naccounts and gave him a clean bill of health on his books. This baseline\n\nestablishes that he knew how to properly handle client funds and not\n\nuse such monies for his own purposes.         After the first audit, the\n\ncommission found:\n\n            He first came to the attention of the Client Security\n      Commission (Commission) regarding trust account issues in\n      approximately November 2009. Mary Kaye Gooding, his\n      bookkeeper at that time, called the Commission and stated\n      that Powell was not handling his trust account properly.\n\n            Successive audits by Commission auditor Allen Davey\n      followed.    Davey testified—and Exhibits 1 and 26\n      substantiate—that as of August 31, 2010, Powell had a\n      shortage of approximately $20,000 in his trust account. An\n      updated audit conducted four months later revealed a\n      $16,000 shortage as of December 31, 2010. A supplemental\n      audit as of August 21, 2011, placed the shortage at\n      approximately $34,778.28.\n\n             In mid-2011, Denise Dooley—who was briefly one of\n      Powell’s bookkeepers—called the Commission to again report\n      ongoing issues with Powell’s trust accounts. That prompted\n      the Office of Professional Regulation to ask the Board to\n      petition the Court and request an interim suspension of\n      Powell    under   Attorney    Discipline,  Disability, and\n      Reinstatement Rule 35.4.\n\f                                     13\n            ....\n\n           The Court ordered Fifth Judicial District Chief Judge\n      Arthur E. Gamble to appoint a trustee for Powell’s trust\n      account. Judge Gamble appointed practicing attorney, part-\n      time magistrate, and experienced trustee Jeffrey Lipman\n      (Lipman) to take control of the account.\n\n            Lipman verified that the amount due and owing to the\n      trust account was now somewhere between $42,000 and\n      $44,000.\n\n(Citations omitted.)\n\n      I can believe that accounting errors may have caused the first\n\naudit after 2006 to reveal bookkeeping issues.     Nevertheless, after the\n\nfirst audit brought these accounting problems to his attention, Powell\n\ncontinued to use client funds for his own personal use. The state of his\n\nfinancial affairs was so bad that his own bookkeeper had to report him,\n\nand we temporarily suspended his license. In the end, he used between\n\n$42,000 and $44,000 of trust funds for his own use. That means he\n\nconverted more than $20,000 in client funds for his own purposes,\n\nbecause the first audit already revealed a $20,000 shortfall.    I cannot\n\nattribute this additional conversion to mere accounting problems.\n\n      In the end, the commission made the finding that “Powell indirectly\n\nconcedes that client money repeatedly went in the firm operating account\n\nand was used to pay bills when it should have been deposited into the\n\ntrust account.” The commission also found: “One witness testified that\n\nwhen Powell needed money for the firm’s operating account he would\n\ntransfer the trust money of certain clients. Powell in large corroborated\n\ntheir testimony.”      This is a clear admission and finding that Powell\n\nintentionally converted clients’ funds for his own use.\n\n      As to the automatic deposit issue regarding credit card charges,\n\nthe commission made the following finding:\n\f                                    14\n             Powell’s former employees also testified that when they\n      made Powell aware of the credit card automatic deposit\n      issue, he failed to diligently follow up with the bank to get\n      the problem corrected. In responding to these allegations\n      Powell alternatively claims (1) the bank where the firm’s\n      credit card account was set up to not have the technology to\n      credit advance payment to the firm’s trust account, and (2)\n      the bank would not get back to him with answers when he\n      contacted it with questions about directing automatic fund\n      deposits.\n\n            The Division finds the employee testimony on this\n      allegation more credible than Powell’s. Once Powell was\n      aware that the credit card, electronic fund transfers were\n      automatically depositing in the firm operating account\n      instead of in the firm trust account, he was obligated to\n      properly stop the bleeding. He did not and he offers no\n      credible justification for any delay in fixing the problem.\n\n(Citations omitted.)\n\n      The logical explanation for his delay in fixing the problem is that\n\nhe needed the money to operate his law office.         As the commission\n\ndetermined, Powell hid all his transgressions from his clients by routinely\n\ntransferring trust account money “to the firm operating account without\n\nnotice to the affected client . . . of what fees were earned, when they were\n\nearned, and why they were earned.” The commission further found that\n\nthe facts supporting the allegation that Powell converted client funds to\n\npay office expenses “are overwhelming.”\n\n      Accordingly, on this record, I would agree with the commission’s\n\nfindings and make the factual finding that Powell knowingly converted\n\nclients’ funds to his own use.    Although some of the funds that were\n\nconverted may have been for advanced fees, some of the money belonged\n\nto his clients to pay third parties. His actions constitute theft as defined\n\nby the Code, which provides in relevant part:\n\n             A person commits theft when the person does any of\n      the following:\n\n            ....\n\f                                    15\n             2.

Reilly, 708\n\nN.W.2d at 83. Months later, Reilly made restitution of the funds, and\n\nthere was no harm to the client. Id. There, we found Reilly violated the\n\nsame trust account rules as the majority finds Powell did. Id. at 84. The\n\ncommission only recommended a suspension. Id. at 82. In response to\n\nthat recommendation, we reaffirmed our position that we are free to\n\nimpose a lesser or greater suspension than recommended by the\n\ncommission.    Id. at 84.   We examined the caselaw and determined\n\nmisappropriation of a client’s funds by itself warrants a revocation of an\n\nattorney’s license. Id. In another recent case, we revoked the license of\n\f                                     16\n\nan attorney, Adams, who disbursed trust account funds to himself on\n\ntwo occasions, without having a colorable claim to the funds and used\n\nthose client funds for his own purposes. Adams, 809 N.W.2d at 545–46.\n\nYet another example involved an attorney who was holding funds for a\n\nclient to settle a real estate matter and misappropriated the funds from\n\nthe trust account to be used in the real estate transaction for her own\n\nuse. Lett, 674 N.W.2d at 142, 144–45.\n\n      Powell’s conduct in this case is no different from Reilly’s, Adams’,\n\nand Lett’s conduct. He used funds in the trust account that clients gave\nto him to pay third parties. As I previously stated:\n\n      We, as a court and as the regulatory body for our profession,\n      have an obligation to protect the public from dishonest\n      attorneys. I echo the beginning of this dissent—dishonesty\n      is a trait that disqualifies a person from the practice of law. A\n      person who uses his law license to steal money or aids\n      another to do so is per se unfit to practice law. Cases like\n      this give the public the perception that a license to practice\n      law is a license to steal.\n\nIowa Supreme Ct. Att’y Disciplinary Bd. v.
