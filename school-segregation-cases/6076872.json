Joseph contends that the trial court erroneously\n\nclassified his business as community property. He asserts that the trial court\n\ndouble counted the business's bank accounts.         He argues that the overall\n\ndistribution of property is inequitable, considering the judgments against him. We\n\naffirm and award attorney fees to Stephanie.\n\n                                     FACTS\n\n       Joseph and Stephanie Vandal were married on August 4, 2000. Joseph's1\n\ntwo young children from his prior marriage lived half of the time with the couple.\n\nStephanie became a stay-at-home mother to care for the children.\n\n       The couple had a son together, who was born on June 25, 2002. Their son\n\nhas been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.\n\n\n\n      1 We refer to the parties by their first names for clarity. No disrespect is\nintended.\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/2\n\n\n       During the marriage, the couple's sole source of income was Joseph's\n\nbusiness. Joseph started his own business as a certified public accountant(CPA)\n\nin 1989 and incorporated it in 1991. He received a salary of approximately $70,000\n\nfrom the business.\n\n       Joseph and Stephanie separated on August 2, 2014. Stephanie filed for\n\ndissolution. After trial, the court entered lengthy findings of fact and conclusions\n\nof law. The court found that the parties' community property included: the\n\nproceeds from the sale of the former family home; the business known as Joseph\n\nJ. Vandal, CPA, P.S., together with its bank accounts and fungible assets; specific\n\nfurniture and personal property; a 2007 BMW; and funds in bank accounts at the\n\ntime of the parties' separation or as transferred after separation from community\n\nfunds. Stephanie's share of the community property was worth $211,646, while\n\nJoseph's was $787,007. Accordingly, the court awarded Stephanie a $287,680\n\nequalizing payment.2\n\n       Joseph appeals.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\n       Joseph argues that the trial court erroneously classified the business as\n\ncommunity property.      Br. of Appellant, 7.     He contends that even if this\n\ncharacterization was proper, the trial court erred by awarding him the business's\n\nbank accounts twice. He further asserts that the overall distribution of assets was\n\n\n\n\n      2 The court noted that this payment could also be viewed as a $175,513\nequalizing payment, plus reimbursement for mortgage payments in the amount of\n$17,167, plus reimbursement of the increase in the line of credit of $95,000.\n\n                                            2\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/3\n\n\ninequitable, especially the maintenance award to Stephanie. Stephanie argues\n\nthat she is entitled to attorney fees on appeal.\n\n  I.   Community Property\n\n       Joseph argues that the trial court erred in characterizing his business as\n\ncommunity property. He asserts that because the business was established\n\nbefore the marriage, it was presumed to be separate property, and the burden was\n\non Stephanie to prove otherwise. Joseph challenges the findings offact supporting\n\nthis characterization and the conclusions of law on this issue.3\n\n       A court's characterization of property as separate or community is a\n\nquestion of law reviewed de novo. In re Marriage of Griswold, 112 Wn. App. 333,\n\n339, 48 P.3d 1018 (2002).         But, factual findings upon which the court's\n\ncharacterization of property is based are reviewed for substantial evidence. Id.\n\nSubstantial evidence is evidence of sufficient quantity to persuade a rational\n\nperson of the truth of the stated premise. Id.\n\n       The character of property as separate or community property is determined\n\nas of the date that the property was acquired. In re Estate of Borghi, 167 Wn.2d\n\n480,484, 219 P.3d 932(2009). Once property is established as separate property,\n\na presumption arises that it remained separate property. Id. But, this presumption\n\ncan be rebutted with sufficient evidence that the owner intended to change the\n\nproperty from separate to community property. Id.\n\n\n\n\n       3 Specifically, Joseph challenges findings of fact 2.8.2.3, 2.8.2.4, 2.8.2.5,\n2.8.2.6, and 2.8.2.7 and conclusions of law 3.4.5.1(f), 3.4.5.2(a), and 3.4.5.4(e).\n\n                                             3\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/4\n\n\n      Here, the court characterized Joseph's business, Joseph J. Vandal CPA\n\nP.S., as community property. The business does audits and tax returns for\n\ncondominium homeowners' associations (HOAs). Joseph began the business in\n\n1989 and incorporated it in 1991, before the marriage. Thus, it was separate\n\nproperty at the time of the marriage.\n\n      But, the court determined that the business lost its characterization as\n\nseparate property. The court found that community funds were paid into the\n\nbusiness. And, many community and family expenses were paid through the\n\nbusiness during the marriage. While Joseph characterized these payments as\n\nloans and said that the accounts were reconciled at the end of the year, no records\n\nverified this allegation. Consequently, the court did not find Joseph's testimony to\n\nbe credible. The court further found that almost the entirety of the business's value\n\nwas based on the goodwill generated by Joseph's toil. The valuation experts and\n\nJoseph testified that the clientele of the business required constant renewal. And,\n\nthe court found that Joseph's salary of $70,000 was inadequate to compensate the\n\ncommunity for his labor. Adopting primarily the analysis of Stephanie's expert,\n\nSteven Kessler, the trial court found the value of the business was $446,000, and\n\nawarded it to Joseph.\n\n       A. Commingling\n\n       Joseph argues that the trial court's findings are not supported by substantial\n\nevidence. First, he contends that the minimal commingling between the business\n\naccounts and community accounts does not support characterizing the business\n\nas community property.\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/5\n\n\n       Where separate property is commingled with community property with no\n\neffort to keep the two separate, it becomes community property. In re Marriage of\n\nSkarbek, 100 Wn. App. 444, 448, 997 P.2d 447 (2000). Commingled funds are\n\npresumed to be community property. Id. The burden is on the spouse claiming\n\nseparate funds to clearly and convincingly trace the funds to a separate property\n\nsource. Id.\n\n       Joseph testified about the commingling of business and community funds.\n\nHe said that all of the income earned from the business went to the community.\n\nStephanie would sign checks for community expenses. Joseph would then write\n\na check from the business into their joint account. He would write \"loan\" on the\n\ncheck to indicate that it was money coming from the business.4 The community\n\npaid its expenses in this way, including the mortgage, line of credit, utilities, plastic\n\nsurgery, vacation rentals, and their son's schooling. This evidence supports the\n\ntrial court's finding of fact 2.8.2.4.\n\n       Joseph also testified that he used an equity line of credit secured by the\n\nfamily house for the business. He explained that when there was a deficit with the\n\nbusiness, he would use this equity line of credit. During his deposition, he\n\nestimated that around $100,000 had been drawn from the equity line of credit for\n\nshortages in the business. This evidence supports the trial court's finding of fact\n\n2.8.2.3.\n\n       4No evidence was presented that these loans were ever repaid or that the\naccounts were otherwise reconciled. As such, the trial court found that Joseph's\ntestimony that these expenses were loans was not credible. Credibility\ndeterminations are for the trier of the fact, and this court will not review them on\nappeal. In re Marriage of Burrill, 113 Wn. App. 863, 868, 56 P.3d 993(2002).\n\n                                               5\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/6\n\n\n       Joseph argues that the commingling of business and community funds does\n\nnot establish that the business became community property. But, Joseph failed to\n\nproduce records at trial to show that the loans from the business to the community\n\nwere ever reconciled. Nor did he show that these funds were treated as loans for\n\npurposes of federal taxes. These records would have been in Joseph's control,\n\nyet he—a CPA—did not produce them.              We conclude that the extensive\n\ncommingling of funds suggests that the business lost its nature as separate\n\nproperty.\n\n       B. Goodwill\n\n       Second, Joseph argues that the value of the business was not primarily\n\nbased on his own labor. Joseph argues that much of the company's goodwill is\n\nbased on the creation of systems that he set up early on and allowed the company\n\nto largely run itself.\n\n       Washington recognizes professional goodwill as an intangible property\n\nsubject to division in a dissolution. In re Marriage of Brooks, 51 Wn. App. 882,\n\n884,756 P.2d 161 (1988). Goodwill is often defined as an expectation of continued\n\npatronage. In re Marriage of Hall, 103 Wn.2d 236, 239, 692 P.2d 175 (1984).\n\nGoodwill is a property or asset that supplements the earning capacity of another\n\nasset, a business, or a profession. Id. at 241. It is a distinct asset, not merely a\n\nfactor contributing to the value of a business. Id. Where goodwill is acquired\n\nduring marriage, it may be community property. See Brooks, 51 Wn. App. at 888-\n\n89.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/7\n\n\n      Both parties' experts testified about the valuation of Joseph's business,\n\nincluding the goodwill. Kessler, Stephanie's expert, used the excess earnings\n\napproach to determine the amount of goodwill in the business. Kessler began by\n\ncalculating the net tangible assets of the business, which reflects Joseph's net\n\ninvestment in the practice.    Once he determined the business's sustainable\n\nearnings, the next step was to determine a market based compensation for\n\nJoseph. Kessler selected a compensation of $200,000 to represent Joseph's\n\nunique skillset.   Using a capitalization rate of 22 percent, Kessler found the\n\ngoodwill value to be $496,234. He valued the business at $534,598.\n\n       Douglas McDaniel, Joseph's expert, also testified about the valuation of the\n\nbusiness. McDaniel used the excess earnings approach method as well. But,\n\nMcDaniel used a different capitalization rate of 26.8 percent. And, he used a\n\ndifferent market based compensation of $235,000. Under this approach, McDaniel\n\ncame up with a goodwill value of $255,078. McDaniel valued the business at\n\n$271,466.\n\n      The court did not fully adopt either expert's analysis. Instead, it adopted\n\nMcDaniel's capitalization rate of 26.8 percent to reflect the risk inherent in the\n\nbusiness. Otherwise, the court adopted Kessler's analysis. Kessler submitted a\n\nrevised business valuation based on the court's order. Using this capitalization\n\nrate, the indicated goodwill value was $407,356. The indicated value of the\n\nbusiness was $445,720.\n\n       The risk inherent in the business included the fact that Joseph has to go up\n\nfor bid every year, and there are competitors. Joseph testified about this risk. He\n\n\n                                            7\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/8\n\n\nexplained that every year the business has to go out for bid. Then, they have to\n\nfollow up and meet with the clients. He recognized that his clients do not have\n\nmuch loyalty to him, because the HOA boards and the condominium management\n\ncompanies change frequently. His clients' loyalty is also extremely price sensitive:\n\nif they can save even $300, then they will switch accountants nine times out of ten.\n\nAnd, he said that a lot of how he gets new clients is \"just going out there, shaking\n\nhands.\"\n\n       Joseph presented no evidence of the value of the business's goodwill prior\n\nto the marriage. He could have produced records to establish that the company's\n\ngoodwill was not the result of his own labor. But, he did not do so. We conclude\n\nthat the experts' testimony supported the finding that the value of the business was\n\nbased almost entirely on goodwill. And, Joseph's client base had constant\n\nturnover, requiring him to constantly go out and form new relationships with new\n\nclients.\n\n       Joseph's toil was community labor. See In re Marriage of Lindemann, 92\n\nWn. App.64, 76-77, 960 P.2d 966(1998)(increased value in cohabitant's business\n\nwas community in character because it had been achieved by community labor).\n\nThus, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that the\n\nbusiness's goodwill was developed by community labor.\n\n       C. Compensation to Community\n\n       Third, Joseph asserts that the community was more than adequately\n\ncompensated for his toil. He contends that the finding of fact which sets out his\n\nsalary is misleading. Joseph argues that since all of the substantial funds used by\n\n\n                                            8\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/9\n\n\nthe community came from the business—approximately $318,000 per year—the\n\ncommunity received far more compensation than merely Joseph's salary.\n\n      The community is entitled to the economic benefit of a spouse's services.\n\nPollock v. Pollock, 7 Wn. App. 394, 401, 499 P.2d 231 (1972). Consequently, if a\n\nspouse \"seeks to retain the separate character of income derived from a\n\ncombination of his separate business and his post-marital personal services with\n\nrespect thereto, he is required to make a contemporaneous segregation of the\n\nincome so derived as between the community and his separate estate.\" Id. This\n\ncan be done by allocating a reasonable, fair salary to the community. Id.; Brooks,\n\n51 Wn. App. at 886-87. Whether a salary is fair depends largely on the earnings\n\nof the business at the time. Brooks, 51 Wn. App. at 887.\n\n      Here, Joseph made no attempt to keep the business's income separate\n\nfrom the community, as discussed above. He admits that his salary of $70,000\n\nwas insufficient to compensate him for his labor. He admits that community\n\nexpenses were paid from the business's income rather than merely from his salary.\n\nThus, the trial court's finding that Joseph's salary alone was inadequate to\n\ncompensate the community for his labor is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n      The    trial   court's findings   regarding   commingling, goodwill, and\n\ncompensation to the community are supported by substantial evidence. The\n\nmajority of the business's value was derived from goodwill. This goodwill was\n\ncreated by Joseph's labor and was a community asset. Joseph did not adequately\n\ncompensate the community for his toil. And, he did not produce records at trial to\n\nshow that community and business funds were treated separately. Therefore, we\n\n\n                                            9\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/10\n\n\nconclude that there was clear, cogent, and convincing evidence to overcome the\n\npresumption of separate property. The trial court did not err in characterizing the\n\nbusiness as community property.\n\n II.   Double Counting\n\n       Joseph argues that the trial court erred by double counting assets that it\n\nawarded to him. He contends that the trial court awarded him the business's bank\n\naccounts twice. This is so, he asserts, because the valuation of the business\n\nincluded the business's bank accounts, yet the trial court awarded both the value\n\nof the business and its bank accounts to Joseph.\n\n       The trial court has broad discretion to distribute property in a dissolution\n\nproceeding. In re Marriage of Wallace, 111 Wn. App. 697, 707, 45 P.3d 1131\n\n(2002). A party challenging a property distribution must demonstrate that the trial\n\ncourt manifestly abused its discretion. Id.\n\n       Joseph raised the issue of potential double counting after the trial court\n\nissued its memorandum opinion. He supported this with a declaration of his expert,\n\nwho stated that the bank accounts were included in the value of the business.\n\nDuring the hearing to enter the final orders, the trial court invited Joseph to move\n\nfor reconsideration on this issue. Joseph did not do so. Nor did he attempt to\n\nidentify and trace the allegedly double counted funds at the hearing.\n\n       Joseph still has not identified and traced these funds on appeal. Instead,\n\nhe simply asserts that the court must have double counted funds, because it\n\ncounted the business's bank accounts twice. But, Joseph's argument overlooks\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/11\n\n\nthe different dates between the valuation of the business and the valuation of the\n\nbank accounts.\n\n        The experts included the liquid assets of the business in their valuations.\n\nHowever, both experts used a valuation date of December 31, 2014. In awarding\n\nthe business's bank accounts to Joseph, the trial court used a valuation date of\n\nAugust 2, 2014, the date of separation. In fact, the trial court valued the bank\n\naccounts as of the date of separation to account for Joseph's extensive\n\npostseparation withdrawals, which were made in violation of a temporary\n\nrestraining order. During the five months that passed between the trial court's\n\nvaluation date and the business's valuation date, Joseph withdrew funds across\n\naccounts, and the business was still operating. Because Joseph never provided\n\nrecords that could identify the exact funds he claims were counted twice, we\n\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n III.   Maintenance\n\n        Joseph contends that the trial court set his continuing financial obligations,\n\nincluding maintenance, beyond his earnings. While he does not challenge any of\n\nthe findings offact supporting these obligations except those previously discussed,\n\nJoseph contends that the overall distribution is inequitable.\n\n        RCW 26.09.090(1) permits the trial court to grant a maintenance order for\n\neither spouse, in such amounts and for such periods of time as the court deems\n\njust. The court must consider all relevant factors including: the financial resources\n\nof the party seeking maintenance and that party's ability to meet his or her needs\n\nindependently; the time necessary to obtain education or training to enable the\n\n\n                                             11\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/12\n\n\nparty to find employment; the standard of living established during the marriage;\n\nthe duration of the marriage; the age, health, and financial obligations of the party\n\nseeking maintenance; and the ability of the party from whom maintenance is\n\nsought to meet his or her needs while still meeting those of the other party. ROW\n\n26.09.090(1)(a)-(f).\n\n       An award of maintenance is within the broad discretion of the trial court. In\n\nre Marriage of Terry, 79 Wn. App. 866, 869, 905 P.2d 935 (1995). The only\n\nlimitation on the amount and duration of maintenance under RCW 26.09.090 is\n\nthat the award must be just. In re Marriage of Bulicek, 59 Wn. App. 630, 633, 800\n\nP.2d 394 (1990). We will find an abuse of discretion only if the trial court bases its\n\naward or denial of spousal maintenance on untenable grounds or for untenable\n\nreasons. Terry, 79 Wn. App. at 869.\n\n       The trial court ordered Joseph to pay maintenance to Stephanie in the\n\namount of $9,000 per month for 72 months. It based this on the fact that both\n\nparties are in good health, but Stephanie did not work outside the home during the\n\nmarriage. While Stephanie intends to go back to school to obtain a master's\n\ndegree and teaching certificate, this will take about five years. The parties had a\n\nhigh standard of living during the marriage, and Joseph's income is $26,501 per\n\nmonth. And, the court found that Joseph's income far exceeds his personal living\n\nexpenses.\n\n       Joseph does not challenge any of these findings, and therefore they are\n\nverities on appeal. In re Marriage of Petrie, 105 Wn. App. 268, 275, 19 P.3d 443\n\n(2001)(unchallenged findings offact are verities on appeal). But, he contends that\n\n\n                                             12\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/13\n\n\nthe court should have considered his debts and other judgments when determining\n\nthe overall distribution. Joseph points out that in addition to the $9,000 per month\n\nmaintenance order, he also has to pay $1,034 per month in child support for their\n\nchild and health insurance for the child. And, he is $90,000 in debt on the business\n\nline of credit, which requires monthly payments of about $2,400.\n\n       Joseph also points to the judgments against him: $175,513.25 as an\n\nequalizing payment to Stephanie to arrive at a 50/50 division of community\n\nproperty, $95,000 to Stephanie to reimburse her for withdrawals on the home line\n\nof credit, $17,167.12 to reimburse Stephanie for mortgage payments, and\n\n$101,691.39 to reimburse their son for withdrawals from his UTMA (uniform\n\ntransfer to minors) account. He suggests that he cannot pay off these judgments\n\nwhile making the required monthly payments.            And, he alleges that the\n\nmaintenance award is a windfall, because Stephanie will receive the benefit of the\n\njudgments in addition to considerable personal property.\n\n       This court has previously upheld maintenance awards to spouses who\n\nreceived significant property awards. See, e.g., In re Marriage of Wright, 179 Wn.\n\nApp. 257, 261, 270, 319 P.3d 45 (2013). In Wright, the trial court awarded\n\n$8,526,834 in community property to the wife, along with a $1.7 million equalizing\n\npayment and maintenance of $1 million spread over three years. Id. at 261. It\n\nawarded $8,657,042 in community property and $979,966 in separate property to\n\nthe husband. Id. The husband argued that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding maintenance, because the wife did not demonstrate financial need in\n\nlight of the property awarded. Id. at 269. The Court of Appeals rejected this\n\n\n                                            13\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/14\n\n\nargument, noting that financial need is not a prerequisite to maintenance. Id. at\n\n269-70.\n\n        Given the trial court's findings regarding Joseph's salary of $26,501.47 per\n\nmonth, the middle range length of the marriage, the parties' standard of living\n\nduring the marriage, and Stephanie's role as caregiver for the children during the\n\nmarriage, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding\n\n$9,000 in monthly maintenance. The award is just in light of the parties' financial\n\npositions.\n\n        This is so even in light of the judgments against Joseph. The trial court may\n\nproperly consider a spouse's waste or concealment of assets in making a property\n\ndistribution. Wallace, 111 Wn. App. at 708. Here, Joseph violated the temporary\n\nrestraining order put in place after the parties separated by withdrawing large sums\n\nof money from community accounts. The parties separated on August 2, 2014.\n\nOn September 15, 2014, the court entered a temporary order imposing financial\n\nrestraints on the parties. Under these restraints, the parties were prohibited from\n\ntransferring property or withdrawing any monies from checking accounts of either\n\nor both parties, unless in the ordinary course of business or for the necessities of\n\nlife.   And, the parties were ordered notify the other of any extraordinary\n\nexpenditures. The court also ordered that Joseph was responsible for paying both\n\nmortgages on the family home.\n\n        In violation of this order, Joseph withdrew a total of $130,691 from\n\ncommunity accounts. He failed to pay the first and second mortgages on the family\n\nhome. Consequently, the mortgages were in arrears in the amount of $17,167\n\n\n                                             14\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/15\n\n\nwhen the home was sold, thereby reducing the proceeds from the sale. Joseph\n\nalso drew $95,000 on the equity line of credit secured by the family home after\n\nseparation. And, Joseph completely emptied the son's UTMA account, which\n\ncontained $101,691 at the time of separation.\n\n      These judgments against Joseph do not make the maintenance award\n\nunjust. The judgments stemmed from Joseph's actions taken in direct violation of\n\na court order. It was not an abuse of discretion to hold him accountable for those\n\nactions.\n\nIV.   Attorney Fees\n\n      Stephanie asserts that this court should award her attorney fees on appeal.\n\nShe contends that she should not be required to use the maintenance and property\n\nassets awarded to her to defend the trial court's decisions. Both parties have\n\nsubmitted financial declarations so that we may determine whether to award\n\nattorney fees and costs.5\n\n       Under RCW 26.09.140, a court has discretion to award attorney fees to\n\neither party depending on the parties' financial resources. The court should\n\nbalance the financial need of the requesting party against the other party's ability\n\nto pay. In re Marriage of Pennamen, 135 Wn. App. 790, 807-08, 146 P.3d 466\n\n(2006).\n\n      Stephanie's financial declaration lists her monthly gross income, which\n\nconsists of maintenance and child support, as $10,034. Her total net income is\n\n\n\n      5 Stephanie moved to strike Joseph's financial declaration as untimely.\nJoseph filed a response, requesting an extension. We deny the motion to strike,\nand we consider both parties' financial declarations.\n\n                                            15\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/16\n\n\n$8,394. Stephanie lists monthly expenses totaling $8,400. And, she states that\n\nshe has no savings to protect her in case of an emergency. Joseph has not made\n\nthe equalizing payments that could alter Stephanie's financial position.\n\n       Joseph's financial declaration states that his monthly gross income is\n\n$23,673. His monthly net income, after taxes and maintenance, is $10,203. He\n\nlists his monthly household expenses as $7,853. Joseph also asserts that he has\n\nmonthly payments totaling $3,060.60 toward his other debts.\n\n         However, Joseph's listed personal monthly debt payments, such as car and\n\nhealth insurance, were historically paid through the business, not personally,\n\nbased on the evidence presented at trial. This is supported by the fact that Joseph\n\ndid not list these expenses on the financial declaration submitted to the court\n\nbelow.\n\n       Therefore, we conclude that Stephanie has financial need and that Joseph\n\nhas the ability to pay her attorney fees. We award Stephanie her appellate attorney\n\nfees and costs, subject to her compliance with RAP 18.1(d).\n\n       We affirm.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f",

Joseph contends that the trial court erroneously\n\nclassified his business as community property. He asserts that the trial court\n\ndouble counted the business's bank accounts.         He argues that the overall\n\ndistribution of property is inequitable, considering the judgments against him. We\n\naffirm and award attorney fees to Stephanie.\n\n                                     FACTS\n\n       Joseph and Stephanie Vandal were married on August 4, 2000. Joseph's1\n\ntwo young children from his prior marriage lived half of the time with the couple.\n\nStephanie became a stay-at-home mother to care for the children.\n\n       The couple had a son together, who was born on June 25, 2002. Their son\n\nhas been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.\n\n\n\n      1 We refer to the parties by their first names for clarity. No disrespect is\nintended.\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/2\n\n\n       During the marriage, the couple's sole source of income was Joseph's\n\nbusiness. Joseph started his own business as a certified public accountant(CPA)\n\nin 1989 and incorporated it in 1991. He received a salary of approximately $70,000\n\nfrom the business.\n\n       Joseph and Stephanie separated on August 2, 2014. Stephanie filed for\n\ndissolution. After trial, the court entered lengthy findings of fact and conclusions\n\nof law. The court found that the parties' community property included: the\n\nproceeds from the sale of the former family home; the business known as Joseph\n\nJ. Vandal, CPA, P.S., together with its bank accounts and fungible assets; specific\n\nfurniture and personal property; a 2007 BMW; and funds in bank accounts at the\n\ntime of the parties' separation or as transferred after separation from community\n\nfunds. Stephanie's share of the community property was worth $211,646, while\n\nJoseph's was $787,007. Accordingly, the court awarded Stephanie a $287,680\n\nequalizing payment.2\n\n       Joseph appeals.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\n       Joseph argues that the trial court erroneously classified the business as\n\ncommunity property.      Br. of Appellant, 7.     He contends that even if this\n\ncharacterization was proper, the trial court erred by awarding him the business's\n\nbank accounts twice. He further asserts that the overall distribution of assets was\n\n\n\n\n      2 The court noted that this payment could also be viewed as a $175,513\nequalizing payment, plus reimbursement for mortgage payments in the amount of\n$17,167, plus reimbursement of the increase in the line of credit of $95,000.\n\n                                            2\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/3\n\n\ninequitable, especially the maintenance award to Stephanie. Stephanie argues\n\nthat she is entitled to attorney fees on appeal.\n\n  I.   Community Property\n\n       Joseph argues that the trial court erred in characterizing his business as\n\ncommunity property. He asserts that because the business was established\n\nbefore the marriage, it was presumed to be separate property, and the burden was\n\non Stephanie to prove otherwise. Joseph challenges the findings offact supporting\n\nthis characterization and the conclusions of law on this issue.3\n\n       A court's characterization of property as separate or community is a\n\nquestion of law reviewed de novo. In re Marriage of Griswold, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n339, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2602262\"><a href=\"/opinion/2602262/in-re-marriage-of-griswold/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002).         But, factual findings upon which the court's\n\ncharacterization of property is based are reviewed for substantial evidence. Id.\n\nSubstantial evidence is evidence of sufficient quantity to persuade a rational\n\nperson of the truth of the stated premise. Id.\n\n       The character of property as separate or community property is determined\n\nas of the date that the property was acquired. In re Estate of Borghi, 167 Wn.2d\n\n480,484, 219 P.3d 932(2009). Once property is established as separate property,\n\na presumption arises that it remained separate property. Id. But, this presumption\n\ncan be rebutted with sufficient evidence that the owner intended to change the\n\nproperty from separate to community property. Id.\n\n\n\n\n       3 Specifically, Joseph challenges findings of fact 2.8.2.3, 2.8.2.4, 2.8.2.5,\n2.8.2.6, and 2.8.2.7 and conclusions of law 3.4.5.1(f), 3.4.5.2(a), and 3.4.5.4(e).\n\n                                             3\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/4\n\n\n      Here, the court characterized Joseph's business, Joseph J. Vandal CPA\n\nP.S., as community property. The business does audits and tax returns for\n\ncondominium homeowners' associations (HOAs). Joseph began the business in\n\n1989 and incorporated it in 1991, before the marriage. Thus, it was separate\n\nproperty at the time of the marriage.\n\n      But, the court determined that the business lost its characterization as\n\nseparate property. The court found that community funds were paid into the\n\nbusiness. And, many community and family expenses were paid through the\n\nbusiness during the marriage. While Joseph characterized these payments as\n\nloans and said that the accounts were reconciled at the end of the year, no records\n\nverified this allegation. Consequently, the court did not find Joseph's testimony to\n\nbe credible. The court further found that almost the entirety of the business's value\n\nwas based on the goodwill generated by Joseph's toil. The valuation experts and\n\nJoseph testified that the clientele of the business required constant renewal. And,\n\nthe court found that Joseph's salary of $70,000 was inadequate to compensate the\n\ncommunity for his labor. Adopting primarily the analysis of Stephanie's expert,\n\nSteven Kessler, the trial court found the value of the business was $446,000, and\n\nawarded it to Joseph.\n\n       A. Commingling\n\n       Joseph argues that the trial court's findings are not supported by substantial\n\nevidence. First, he contends that the minimal commingling between the business\n\naccounts and community accounts does not support characterizing the business\n\nas community property.\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/5\n\n\n       Where separate property is commingled with community property with no\n\neffort to keep the two separate, it becomes community property. In re Marriage of\n\nSkarbek, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1195344\"><a href=\"/opinion/1195344/in-re-marriage-of-skarbek/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). Commingled funds are\n\npresumed to be community property. Id. The burden is on the spouse claiming\n\nseparate funds to clearly and convincingly trace the funds to a separate property\n\nsource. Id.\n\n       Joseph testified about the commingling of business and community funds.\n\nHe said that all of the income earned from the business went to the community.\n\nStephanie would sign checks for community expenses. Joseph would then write\n\na check from the business into their joint account. He would write \"loan\" on the\n\ncheck to indicate that it was money coming from the business.4 The community\n\npaid its expenses in this way, including the mortgage, line of credit, utilities, plastic\n\nsurgery, vacation rentals, and their son's schooling. This evidence supports the\n\ntrial court's finding of fact 2.8.2.4.\n\n       Joseph also testified that he used an equity line of credit secured by the\n\nfamily house for the business. He explained that when there was a deficit with the\n\nbusiness, he would use this equity line of credit. During his deposition, he\n\nestimated that around $100,000 had been drawn from the equity line of credit for\n\nshortages in the business. This evidence supports the trial court's finding of fact\n\n2.8.2.3.\n\n       4No evidence was presented that these loans were ever repaid or that the\naccounts were otherwise reconciled. As such, the trial court found that Joseph's\ntestimony that these expenses were loans was not credible. Credibility\ndeterminations are for the trier of the fact, and this court will not review them on\nappeal. In re Marriage of Burrill, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 868, 56 P.3d 993(2002).\n\n                                               5\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/6\n\n\n       Joseph argues that the commingling of business and community funds does\n\nnot establish that the business became community property. But, Joseph failed to\n\nproduce records at trial to show that the loans from the business to the community\n\nwere ever reconciled. Nor did he show that these funds were treated as loans for\n\npurposes of federal taxes. These records would have been in Joseph's control,\n\nyet he—a CPA—did not produce them.              We conclude that the extensive\n\ncommingling of funds suggests that the business lost its nature as separate\n\nproperty.\n\n       B. Goodwill\n\n       Second, Joseph argues that the value of the business was not primarily\n\nbased on his own labor. Joseph argues that much of the company's goodwill is\n\nbased on the creation of systems that he set up early on and allowed the company\n\nto largely run itself.\n\n       Washington recognizes professional goodwill as an intangible property\n\nsubject to division in a dissolution. In re Marriage of Brooks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n884,756 P.2d 161 (1988). Goodwill is often defined as an expectation of continued\n\npatronage.

Id. at 241. It is a distinct asset, not merely a\n\nfactor contributing to the value of a business. Id. Where goodwill is acquired\n\nduring marriage, it may be community property. See Brooks, 51 Wn. App. at 888-\n\n89.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/7\n\n\n      Both parties' experts testified about the valuation of Joseph's business,\n\nincluding the goodwill. Kessler, Stephanie's expert, used the excess earnings\n\napproach to determine the amount of goodwill in the business. Kessler began by\n\ncalculating the net tangible assets of the business, which reflects Joseph's net\n\ninvestment in the practice.    Once he determined the business's sustainable\n\nearnings, the next step was to determine a market based compensation for\n\nJoseph. Kessler selected a compensation of $200,000 to represent Joseph's\n\nunique skillset.   Using a capitalization rate of 22 percent, Kessler found the\n\ngoodwill value to be $496,234. He valued the business at $534,598.\n\n       Douglas McDaniel, Joseph's expert, also testified about the valuation of the\n\nbusiness. McDaniel used the excess earnings approach method as well. But,\n\nMcDaniel used a different capitalization rate of 26.8 percent. And, he used a\n\ndifferent market based compensation of $235,000. Under this approach, McDaniel\n\ncame up with a goodwill value of $255,078. McDaniel valued the business at\n\n$271,466.\n\n      The court did not fully adopt either expert's analysis. Instead, it adopted\n\nMcDaniel's capitalization rate of 26.8 percent to reflect the risk inherent in the\n\nbusiness. Otherwise, the court adopted Kessler's analysis. Kessler submitted a\n\nrevised business valuation based on the court's order. Using this capitalization\n\nrate, the indicated goodwill value was $407,356. The indicated value of the\n\nbusiness was $445,720.\n\n       The risk inherent in the business included the fact that Joseph has to go up\n\nfor bid every year, and there are competitors. Joseph testified about this risk. He\n\n\n                                            7\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/8\n\n\nexplained that every year the business has to go out for bid. Then, they have to\n\nfollow up and meet with the clients. He recognized that his clients do not have\n\nmuch loyalty to him, because the HOA boards and the condominium management\n\ncompanies change frequently. His clients' loyalty is also extremely price sensitive:\n\nif they can save even $300, then they will switch accountants nine times out of ten.\n\nAnd, he said that a lot of how he gets new clients is \"just going out there, shaking\n\nhands.\"\n\n       Joseph presented no evidence of the value of the business's goodwill prior\n\nto the marriage. He could have produced records to establish that the company's\n\ngoodwill was not the result of his own labor. But, he did not do so. We conclude\n\nthat the experts' testimony supported the finding that the value of the business was\n\nbased almost entirely on goodwill. And, Joseph's client base had constant\n\nturnover, requiring him to constantly go out and form new relationships with new\n\nclients.\n\n       Joseph's toil was community labor. See In re Marriage of Lindemann, 92\n\nWn. App.64, 76-77, 960 P.2d 966(1998)(increased value in cohabitant's business\n\nwas community in character because it had been achieved by community labor).\n\nThus, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that the\n\nbusiness's goodwill was developed by community labor.\n\n       C. Compensation to Community\n\n       Third, Joseph asserts that the community was more than adequately\n\ncompensated for his toil. He contends that the finding of fact which sets out his\n\nsalary is misleading. Joseph argues that since all of the substantial funds used by\n\n\n                                            8\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/9\n\n\nthe community came from the business—approximately $318,000 per year—the\n\ncommunity received far more compensation than merely Joseph's salary.\n\n      The community is entitled to the economic benefit of a spouse's services.\n\nPollock v. Pollock, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 401, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1418954\"><a href=\"/opinion/1418954/pollock-v-pollock/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972). Consequently, if a\n\nspouse \"seeks to retain the separate character of income derived from a\n\ncombination of his separate business and his post-marital personal services with\n\nrespect thereto, he is required to make a contemporaneous segregation of the\n\nincome so derived as between the community and his separate estate.\" Id. This\n\ncan be done by allocating a reasonable, fair salary to the community. Id.; Brooks,\n\n51 Wn. App. at 886-87. Whether a salary is fair depends largely on the earnings\n\nof the business at the time. Brooks, 51 Wn. App. at 887.\n\n      Here, Joseph made no attempt to keep the business's income separate\n\nfrom the community, as discussed above. He admits that his salary of $70,000\n\nwas insufficient to compensate him for his labor. He admits that community\n\nexpenses were paid from the business's income rather than merely from his salary.\n\nThus, the trial court's finding that Joseph's salary alone was inadequate to\n\ncompensate the community for his labor is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n      The    trial   court's findings   regarding   commingling, goodwill, and\n\ncompensation to the community are supported by substantial evidence. The\n\nmajority of the business's value was derived from goodwill. This goodwill was\n\ncreated by Joseph's labor and was a community asset. Joseph did not adequately\n\ncompensate the community for his toil. And, he did not produce records at trial to\n\nshow that community and business funds were treated separately. Therefore, we\n\n\n                                            9\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/10\n\n\nconclude that there was clear, cogent, and convincing evidence to overcome the\n\npresumption of separate property. The trial court did not err in characterizing the\n\nbusiness as community property.\n\n II.   Double Counting\n\n       Joseph argues that the trial court erred by double counting assets that it\n\nawarded to him. He contends that the trial court awarded him the business's bank\n\naccounts twice. This is so, he asserts, because the valuation of the business\n\nincluded the business's bank accounts, yet the trial court awarded both the value\n\nof the business and its bank accounts to Joseph.\n\n       The trial court has broad discretion to distribute property in a dissolution\n\nproceeding. In re Marriage of Wallace, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 707, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2638676\"><a href=\"/opinion/2638676/in-re-marriage-of-wallace/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(2002). A party challenging a property distribution must demonstrate that the trial\n\ncourt manifestly abused its discretion. Id.\n\n       Joseph raised the issue of potential double counting after the trial court\n\nissued its memorandum opinion. He supported this with a declaration of his expert,\n\nwho stated that the bank accounts were included in the value of the business.\n\nDuring the hearing to enter the final orders, the trial court invited Joseph to move\n\nfor reconsideration on this issue. Joseph did not do so. Nor did he attempt to\n\nidentify and trace the allegedly double counted funds at the hearing.\n\n       Joseph still has not identified and traced these funds on appeal. Instead,\n\nhe simply asserts that the court must have double counted funds, because it\n\ncounted the business's bank accounts twice. But, Joseph's argument overlooks\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/11\n\n\nthe different dates between the valuation of the business and the valuation of the\n\nbank accounts.\n\n        The experts included the liquid assets of the business in their valuations.\n\nHowever, both experts used a valuation date of December 31, 2014. In awarding\n\nthe business's bank accounts to Joseph, the trial court used a valuation date of\n\nAugust 2, 2014, the date of separation. In fact, the trial court valued the bank\n\naccounts as of the date of separation to account for Joseph's extensive\n\npostseparation withdrawals, which were made in violation of a temporary\n\nrestraining order. During the five months that passed between the trial court's\n\nvaluation date and the business's valuation date, Joseph withdrew funds across\n\naccounts, and the business was still operating. Because Joseph never provided\n\nrecords that could identify the exact funds he claims were counted twice, we\n\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n III.   Maintenance\n\n        Joseph contends that the trial court set his continuing financial obligations,\n\nincluding maintenance, beyond his earnings. While he does not challenge any of\n\nthe findings offact supporting these obligations except those previously discussed,\n\nJoseph contends that the overall distribution is inequitable.\n\n        RCW 26.09.090(1) permits the trial court to grant a maintenance order for\n\neither spouse, in such amounts and for such periods of time as the court deems\n\njust. The court must consider all relevant factors including: the financial resources\n\nof the party seeking maintenance and that party's ability to meet his or her needs\n\nindependently; the time necessary to obtain education or training to enable the\n\n\n                                             11\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/12\n\n\nparty to find employment; the standard of living established during the marriage;\n\nthe duration of the marriage; the age, health, and financial obligations of the party\n\nseeking maintenance; and the ability of the party from whom maintenance is\n\nsought to meet his or her needs while still meeting those of the other party. ROW\n\n26.09.090(1)(a)-(f).\n\n       An award of maintenance is within the broad discretion of the trial court. In\n\nre Marriage of Terry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 869, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1375032\"><a href=\"/opinion/1375032/in-re-marriage-of-terry/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). The only\n\nlimitation on the amount and duration of maintenance under RCW 26.09.090 is\n\nthat the award must be just. In re Marriage of Bulicek, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 633, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612412\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612412/in-the-matter-of-marriage-of-bulicek/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990). We will find an abuse of discretion only if the trial court bases its\n\naward or denial of spousal maintenance on untenable grounds or for untenable\n\nreasons. Terry, 79 Wn. App. at 869.\n\n       The trial court ordered Joseph to pay maintenance to Stephanie in the\n\namount of $9,000 per month for 72 months. It based this on the fact that both\n\nparties are in good health, but Stephanie did not work outside the home during the\n\nmarriage. While Stephanie intends to go back to school to obtain a master's\n\ndegree and teaching certificate, this will take about five years. The parties had a\n\nhigh standard of living during the marriage, and Joseph's income is $26,501 per\n\nmonth. And, the court found that Joseph's income far exceeds his personal living\n\nexpenses.\n\n       Joseph does not challenge any of these findings, and therefore they are\n\nverities on appeal. In re Marriage of Petrie, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(2001)(unchallenged findings offact are verities on appeal). But, he contends that\n\n\n                                             12\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/13\n\n\nthe court should have considered his debts and other judgments when determining\n\nthe overall distribution. Joseph points out that in addition to the $9,000 per month\n\nmaintenance order, he also has to pay $1,034 per month in child support for their\n\nchild and health insurance for the child. And, he is $90,000 in debt on the business\n\nline of credit, which requires monthly payments of about $2,400.\n\n       Joseph also points to the judgments against him: $175,513.25 as an\n\nequalizing payment to Stephanie to arrive at a 50/50 division of community\n\nproperty, $95,000 to Stephanie to reimburse her for withdrawals on the home line\n\nof credit, $17,167.12 to reimburse Stephanie for mortgage payments, and\n\n$101,691.39 to reimburse their son for withdrawals from his UTMA (uniform\n\ntransfer to minors) account. He suggests that he cannot pay off these judgments\n\nwhile making the required monthly payments.            And, he alleges that the\n\nmaintenance award is a windfall, because Stephanie will receive the benefit of the\n\njudgments in addition to considerable personal property.\n\n       This court has previously upheld maintenance awards to spouses who\n\nreceived significant property awards. See, e.g., In re Marriage of Wright, 179 Wn.\n\nApp. 257, 261, 270, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013). In Wright, the trial court awarded\n\n$8,526,834 in community property to the wife, along with a $1.7 million equalizing\n\npayment and maintenance of $1 million spread over three years. Id. at 261. It\n\nawarded $8,657,042 in community property and $979,966 in separate property to\n\nthe husband. Id. The husband argued that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding maintenance, because the wife did not demonstrate financial need in\n\nlight of the property awarded. Id. at 269. The Court of Appeals rejected this\n\n\n                                            13\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/14\n\n\nargument, noting that financial need is not a prerequisite to maintenance. Id. at\n\n269-70.\n\n        Given the trial court's findings regarding Joseph's salary of $26,501.47 per\n\nmonth, the middle range length of the marriage, the parties' standard of living\n\nduring the marriage, and Stephanie's role as caregiver for the children during the\n\nmarriage, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding\n\n$9,000 in monthly maintenance. The award is just in light of the parties' financial\n\npositions.\n\n        This is so even in light of the judgments against Joseph. The trial court may\n\nproperly consider a spouse's waste or concealment of assets in making a property\n\ndistribution. Wallace, 111 Wn. App. at 708. Here, Joseph violated the temporary\n\nrestraining order put in place after the parties separated by withdrawing large sums\n\nof money from community accounts. The parties separated on August 2, 2014.\n\nOn September 15, 2014, the court entered a temporary order imposing financial\n\nrestraints on the parties. Under these restraints, the parties were prohibited from\n\ntransferring property or withdrawing any monies from checking accounts of either\n\nor both parties, unless in the ordinary course of business or for the necessities of\n\nlife.   And, the parties were ordered notify the other of any extraordinary\n\nexpenditures. The court also ordered that Joseph was responsible for paying both\n\nmortgages on the family home.\n\n        In violation of this order, Joseph withdrew a total of $130,691 from\n\ncommunity accounts. He failed to pay the first and second mortgages on the family\n\nhome. Consequently, the mortgages were in arrears in the amount of $17,167\n\n\n                                             14\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/15\n\n\nwhen the home was sold, thereby reducing the proceeds from the sale. Joseph\n\nalso drew $95,000 on the equity line of credit secured by the family home after\n\nseparation. And, Joseph completely emptied the son's UTMA account, which\n\ncontained $101,691 at the time of separation.\n\n      These judgments against Joseph do not make the maintenance award\n\nunjust. The judgments stemmed from Joseph's actions taken in direct violation of\n\na court order. It was not an abuse of discretion to hold him accountable for those\n\nactions.\n\nIV.   Attorney Fees\n\n      Stephanie asserts that this court should award her attorney fees on appeal.\n\nShe contends that she should not be required to use the maintenance and property\n\nassets awarded to her to defend the trial court's decisions. Both parties have\n\nsubmitted financial declarations so that we may determine whether to award\n\nattorney fees and costs.5\n\n       Under RCW 26.09.140, a court has discretion to award attorney fees to\n\neither party depending on the parties' financial resources. The court should\n\nbalance the financial need of the requesting party against the other party's ability\n\nto pay. In re Marriage of Pennamen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

Her total net income is\n\n\n\n      5 Stephanie moved to strike Joseph's financial declaration as untimely.\nJoseph filed a response, requesting an extension. We deny the motion to strike,\nand we consider both parties' financial declarations.\n\n                                            15\n\fNo. 74930-7-1/16\n\n\n$8,394. Stephanie lists monthly expenses totaling $8,400. And, she states that\n\nshe has no savings to protect her in case of an emergency. Joseph has not made\n\nthe equalizing payments that could alter Stephanie's financial position.\n\n       Joseph's financial declaration states that his monthly gross income is\n\n$23,673. His monthly net income, after taxes and maintenance, is $10,203. He\n\nlists his monthly household expenses as $7,853. Joseph also asserts that he has\n\nmonthly payments totaling $3,060.60 toward his other debts.\n\n         However, Joseph's listed personal monthly debt payments, such as car and\n\nhealth insurance, were historically paid through the business, not personally,\n\nbased on the evidence presented at trial. This is supported by the fact that Joseph\n\ndid not list these expenses on the financial declaration submitted to the court\n\nbelow.\n\n       Therefore, we conclude that Stephanie has financial need and that Joseph\n\nhas the ability to pay her attorney fees. We award Stephanie her appellate attorney\n\nfees and costs, subject to her compliance with RAP 18.1(d).\n\n       We affirm.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f</pre>",
