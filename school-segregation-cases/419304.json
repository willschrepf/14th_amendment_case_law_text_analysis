Johnson, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct.\n\n2475, 132 L.Ed.2d 762 (1995).            Because the district court did not\n\nhave       the   benefit of   Miller     when   it   adopted   the   challenged\n\nredistricting plan, we remand the case to allow the district court\n\nto reevaluate the plan under Miller.\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Over a decade ago, this case originated as a class-action\n\nbrought by black citizens of Alabama (\"Dillard\") to challenge the\n\n\n\n\n       *\n      Honorable Joseph F. Weis, Jr., Senior U.S. Circuit Judge\nfor the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\fat-large voting systems1 used to elect county commissioners in nine\n\nAlabama counties.2      In 1987, Dillard amended the complaint by\n\nadding the City of Greensboro, Alabama (\"Greensboro\"),3 among other\ncities, counties and county school boards, as a defendant and\n\nalleging that the at-large system used to elect the Greensboro city\n\ncouncil violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as\n\namended, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1994).        Section 2 provides that no state\n\nor political subdivision may impose or apply a voting qualification\n\nor prerequisite to voting or any standard, practice, or procedure\n\nthat \"results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any\n\ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(a).        Dillard claims that, under the at-large\n\nsystem, \"the political processes ... are not equally open to\n\nparticipation     by   [blacks]   ...    in     that   [blacks]   have   less\n\nopportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in\n\nthe   political   process   and   to    elect   representatives    of    their\n\nchoice.\"   42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).\n\n\n      1\n      At-large voting systems use multimember voting districts\nwhere constituents vote for more than one candidate, and all\nelected candidates represent the same district rather than their\nindividual districts. This system often makes it difficult for\nminority groups to elect candidates of their choice because they\ndo not make up a majority of the population. Such a procedure\nalso is known to result in a dilution of voting power. See\nRogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 616-17, 102 S.Ct. 3272, 3275, 73\nL.Ed.2d 1012 (1982).\n      2\n      For a synopsis of the procedural history of this action,\nsee Dillard v. Baldwin County Board of Education, 686 F.Supp.\n1459 (M.D.Ala.1988).\n      3\n      Greensboro is located in Hale County in western Alabama.\nAccording to the 1990 census, Greensboro has a total population\nof 3,047. Blacks comprise 62% of the population and 56% of the\nvoting age population.\n\f     Pursuant to a 1987 consent decree, Greensboro conceded that\n\nits at-large system violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 4\nTo   remedy    this   violation,    Greensboro     and    Dillard    submitted\n\ncompeting     redistricting   plans.     R1-1-1;         Supp.   R1-492.   The\n\ndistrict court referred the case to a United States magistrate\n\njudge to serve as a special master in the case.              Two evidentiary\n\nhearings were conducted by the magistrate judge in 1988, but no\n\nredistricting plan was adopted.         In May 1992, the parties agreed\n\nthat the plans that had been submitted to the court in 1988 could\n\nno longer be used because of demographic changes identified in the\n\n1990 census. Consequently, new plans were submitted by Dillard and\n\nGreensboro.        The   court     adopted   Greensboro's        single-member\n\ndistricting plan on an interim basis.5\n\n     Greensboro conducted municipal elections in 1992 pursuant to\n\nthis interim plan.\n\n     The 1992 plan had five districts; in three of them, African-\n     Americans were a majority of the voting age population.\n     District 1 contained a black voting age population of 83%;\n     District 2 contained a black voting age population of 58%;\n     and District 3 contained a black voting age population of 75%.\n     Districts 1 and 3 elected black councilmembers in 1992, and\n     District 2 elected a white candidate over a black candidate.\n\nDillard v. City of Greensboro, 865 F.Supp. 773, 774 (M.D.Ala.1994).\n\n     4\n      The parties in the amended class action agreed for the\ndistrict court to treat 165 out of the 183 jurisdictions\nchallenged as individual lawsuits, with separate files and civil\naction numbers. Greensboro is one of those 165 jurisdictions.\nDillard v. Baldwin County Bd. of Edu., 686 F.Supp. at 1461.\n     5\n      Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires that the United\nStates Attorney General preclear any plan proposed by a State or\npolitical subdivision that is subject to 42 U.S.C. § 1973b. 42\nU.S.C. § 1973c. The Code of Federal Regulations, however,\nprovides that a federal court may authorize the emergency interim\nuse of a redistricting plan without first getting approval of the\nAttorney General. 28 C.F.R. § 51.18(c) (1995).\n\fIn December 1992, the Attorney General concluded that the 1992 plan\n\nimproperly \"fragmented black population concentrations in order to\n\nlower the black percentage in District 2,\" and refused to preclear\n\nthe plan.   R2-66-2 (emphasis added).     The Attorney General pointed\n\nto the fact that \"a black-supported candidate in District 2 was\n\ndefeated\" as evidence of racial gerrymandering.          Id.\n\n     In   August   1993,   Greensboro   submitted   a   new    plan   to   the\n\nAttorney General for preclearance.        The 1993 plan created three\n\nmajority-black districts.     District 1 contained a black voting age\n\npopulation of 83%;         District 2 contained a black voting age\n\npopulation of 63%;     and District 3 contained a black voting age\n\npopulation of 73%.     Once again, the Attorney General refused to\n\npreclear the plan under section 5.         The Attorney General found\n\nthat, although the black voting age population of District 2 had\n\nbeen increased from 58% to 63%, the 1993 plan still improperly\n\nhindered blacks from electing candidates of their choice.                  The\n\nAttorney General made the following observations:\n\n     [T]he opportunity for black voters to elect a representative\n     of their choice in [District 2] appears to have been\n     constrained deliberately, taking into account the continued\n     fragmentation of black population concentrations, the pattern\n     of racially polarized voting and the reduced electoral\n     participation by black persons, which is traceable to a\n     history of discrimination.\n\n          The city has provided no satisfactory explanation for\n     limiting black electoral opportunities in this manner.\n     Indeed, the city was aware of several alternative plans that\n     created three districts in which black voters constituted a\n     greater majority of the voting age population in a third\n     district than in proposed District 2. While the city was not\n     required under the Voting Rights Act to adopt any specific\n     alternative plan, it is not free to adopt a districting plan\n     which, as would appear here, is calculated to limit black\n     voting strength.\n\nR2-90-Attach. at 2.\n\f     In January 1994, Dillard filed a renewed motion for further\n\nrelief and requested that the magistrate judge recommend adopting\n\nDillard's plan, submitted twice previously, in 1991 and 1993.   On\n\nOctober 11, 1994, the district court approved the magistrate\n\njudge's recommendation, adopted the single-member redistricting\n\nplan proposed by Dillard, and ordered immediate new elections.6\n\nThe plan adopted by the district court in 1994 and currently at\n\nissue in this appeal has three majority-black districts containing\n\nblack voting age populations in the respective districts of 85%,\n\n80% and 76%.   Greensboro claims that the district court erred in\n\nadopting Dillard's plan because it allegedly is a race-conscious\n\neffort to guarantee direct proportionality of representation by\n\nmanipulating district lines.7\n\n                           II. ANALYSIS\n\n     The issue before this court is whether the redistricting plan\n\nproposed by Dillard and approved by the district court in 1994\n\n     6\n      A plan prepared and adopted by a federal court to remedy a\nsection 2 violation is not subject to the preclearance\nrequirements of section 5. McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U.S. 130,\n138, 101 S.Ct. 2224, 2230, 68 L.Ed.2d 724 (1981).\n\n          Greensboro moved for a stay of the district court's\n     order pending the outcome of this appeal. That stay was\n     denied by the district court. Dillard v. City of\n     Greensboro, 870 F.Supp. 1031 (M.D.Ala.1994).\n     7\n      Dillard cites United States v. Hays, --- U.S. ----, 115\nS.Ct. 2431, 132 L.Ed.2d 635 (1995), in support of his contention\nthat Greensboro has no standing to challenge the district court's\ndecision. In Hayes, the Court held that plaintiffs, who were not\nresidents of the district that was the focus of their racial\ngerrymandering claim and could not demonstrate that they had been\nsubjected to racial classification, did not have standing to\nchallenge Louisiana's congressional redistricting plan. Id. at -\n---, 115 S.Ct. at 2437. Here, Greensboro is a defendant in the\naction and properly appeals the final decision of the district\ncourt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\fconstitutes a violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act or\n\nfails to correct Greensboro's violation of section 2.         We examine\n\nthe findings of the district court under the \"clearly erroneous\"\n\nstandard.    Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. at 627, 102 S.Ct. at 3281;\n\nDillard v. Crenshaw County, 831 F.2d 246, 248 (11th Cir.1987).\n\nWhen   evaluating    whether   Dillard's   proposed   plan   provides   an\n\nadequate remedy for the section 2 violation, the district court\n\nmust determine that the remedy itself satisfies section 2. Dillard\n\nv. Crenshaw County, 831 F.2d at 249 (citing Edge v. Sumter County\n\nSch. Dist., 775 F.2d 1509, 1510 (11th Cir.1985) (stating that a\n\n\"district court could not validly adopt a reapportionment plan\n\nwithout determining whether the plan complied with Section 2 of the\n\nVoting Rights Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1973\")).\n\nA. Application of Miller\n\n       The Supreme Court's decision in Miller governs our analysis of\n\nthis case.    At the heart of     Miller is the Court's determination\n\nthat, when those drawing voting district lines use race as the\n\n\"predominant\" factor or place more value on race than on other\n\ntraditional considerations, such as compactness and contiguity, the\n\nvoting districts must satisfy strict scrutiny, \"our most rigorous\n\nand exacting standard of constitutional review.\"        Id. at ----, 115\n\nS.Ct. at 2490.      At issue in   Miller was Georgia's congressional\n\nredistricting plan;    specifically, \"whether Georgia's new Eleventh\n\nDistrict gives rise to a valid equal protection claim ... and, if\n\nso, whether it can be sustained nonetheless as narrowly tailored to\n\nserve a compelling governmental interest.\"      Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct.\n\nat 2482.      In 1991, the Georgia General Assembly submitted a\n\fcongressional        redistricting      plan    to    the       Attorney           General   for\n\npreclearance as required by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nId. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2483.              The plan called for an increase in\n\nthe number of majority-black districts from one to two.                               Id.    The\n\nAttorney   General      refused       preclearance,         however,          and     \"noted    a\n\nconcern    that      Georgia    had    created       only       two        majority-minority\n\ndistricts, and that the proposed plan did not \"recognize' certain\n\nminority populations by placing them in a majority-black district.\"\n\nId. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2483-84 (citation omitted).                              The General\n\nAssembly then submitted a second plan to the Attorney General for\n\npreclearance, but the Justice Department, concluding \"that Georgia\n\nhad \"failed to explain adequately' its failure to create a third\n\nmajority-minority district,\" again refused preclearance. Id. at --\n\n--, 115 S.Ct. at 2484 (citation omitted).                   For the third time, the\n\nGeneral    Assembly      attempted      to     create       a    plan        that    would     be\n\nacceptable      to     the     Attorney       General.                It     created     three\n\nmajority-minority districts using as a model the \"max-black\" plan\n\nproffered by the American Civil Liberties Union.                             Id.    This final\n\nplan formed an Eleventh District that was drawn predominantly based\n\non race.      Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2485.\n\n     The      Court    began    its    analysis       of        the    Georgia        plan     by\n\nsummarizing its holding in a previous redistricting case, Shaw v.\n\nReno, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993).                                   In\n\nShaw,   the    Court    applied       the    Equal    Protection             Clause    of    the\n\nFourteenth Amendment in the voting rights context and held that\n\n\"redistricting legislation that is so bizarre on its face that it\n\nis \"unexplainable on grounds other than race' ... demands the same\n\fclose scrutiny that we give other state laws that classify citizens\n\nby race.\"       Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2825 (quoting                 Arlington\n\nHeights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266, 97\n\nS.Ct. 555, 564, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977)).                 In     Miller, the Court\n\nclarified Shaw:       \"Just as the State may not, absent extraordinary\n\njustification, segregate citizens on the basis of race in its\n\npublic parks ... so did we recognize in Shaw that it may not\n\nseparate its citizens into different voting districts on the basis\n\nof race.\"      Miller, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2486 (citations\n\nomitted).      In     Miller,   the   Court    warned    federal      courts    that\n\nreviewing redistricting legislation \"represents a serious intrusion\n\non the most vital of local functions.\"            Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at\n\n2488.   The Court also noted that it is often difficult for a court\n\nto distinguish \"between being aware of racial considerations and\n\nbeing motivated by them.\"        Id.\n\nB. District Court's Analysis of the Plan\n\n     Dillard attempts to distinguish this case from Miller by\n\narguing   in    his    supplemental    brief    that,        unlike   Miller,    the\n\nGreensboro plan was adopted by a federal district court, not a\n\nlegislature.        We do not find any merit in this distinction.\n\nWhether a redistricting plan is adopted by a court or a legislature\n\ndoes not affect a party's right to challenge the plan. Admittedly,\n\nwe are faced with an unusual factual situation here.                      In most\n\nvoting rights cases, the redistricting plan that is challenged is\n\none developed by a legislature.          Here, the plan was developed by\n\nDillard, adopted by the district court, and is now challenged by\n\nGreensboro.      Despite the unusual posture of the case, however, we\n\ffind that Greensboro has equal standing with Dillard to challenge\n\nthe district court's plan.\n\n     If   the   district       court   determines     on   remand    that   racial\n\ngerrymandering exists, then the redistricting plan will be the\n\nsubject of strict scrutiny.            Under the strict scrutiny test, the\n\nplan must be shown to be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling\n\nstate interest.     This test will be satisfied if evidence of past\n\ndiscrimination is shown and there is a sufficient evidentiary basis\n\nto establish that the plan is narrowly tailored to remedy that\n\ndiscrimination.     Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2491.\n\n     The Supreme Court requires that district courts evaluate\n\nredistricting     plans    in     terms    of      \"traditional      race-neutral\n\ndistricting principles, including but not limited to compactness,\n\ncontiguity,     respect   for    political       subdivisions   or   communities\n\ndefined by actual shared interests.\"               Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at\n\n2488.     Our   review    of    the    record,    particularly      the   hearings\n\nconducted by the magistrate judge in 1988, 1992 and 1993, show an\n\noverwhelming emphasis on race with little or no examination of\n\nrace-neutral districting principles.              Particularly disturbing is\n\nthe testimony regarding the propensity of black voters allegedly to\n\nvote only for black candidates:\n\n     Q: Mr. Gray, you are taking it as a given that in a black\n     majority district, the voters, if you endorse a black\n     candidate because of his race, that the voters should likewise\n     favor the black candidate simply because he is black?\n\n     A: That's probably a fair assessment.\n\n                                        ....\n\n     Q: [The COURT]: Under your plan [the plan ultimately adopted\n     by the district court], you're guaranteed three black council\n     persons.\n\f     A: [Jerome GRAY]:   Yes.\n\nR6-60;    R6-72.\n\n     Q: [Def. Counsel]: Well, do you agree or disagree that your\n     plan you favor is certainly a form of gerrymandering, with the\n     view of achieving very high majorities of black voters?\n\n     A: [Singleton, resident of Greensboro]: I would disagree with\n     you.\n\n     Q: Well, isn't that its purpose, to achieve and to obtain very\n     high majorities of black voters, in excess of 80 percent, in\n     at least three of the council districts?\n\n     A: Sure, it is.\n\n     Q: And to do that, you've drawn very specific lines to achieve\n     that purpose?\n\n     A: Yes.\n\nR7-36.\n\n     Q [The Court]: What is it about this plan that the City has\n     proposed that leads you to believe that in District 2,\n     African-Americans would not have an opportunity to elect a\n     candidate of their choice?\n\n     A [Singleton]: Well, I think that in District 2, that the\n     City has not really looked at the majority voting age in that\n     community, and based on the lives [sic] in which it was drawn,\n     we feel that there was not enough people, African-Americans,\n     in that district based on their lines, to successfully elect\n     an African-American in that district.\n\nR7-48-49. This testimony reflects precisely the racially pejorative\n\npredisposition that the Supreme Court sought to eradicate in\n\nMiller:\n\n     When the State assigns voters on the basis of race, it engages\n     in the offensive and demeaning assumption that voters of a\n     particular race, because of their race, \"think alike, share\n     the same political interests, and will prefer the same\n     candidates at the polls.\" ... Race-based assignments \"embody\n     stereotypes that treat individuals as the product of their\n     race, evaluating their thoughts and efforts—their very worth\n     as citizens—according to a criterion barred to the Government\n     by history and the Constitution.\"\n\nMiller, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2486 (citations omitted).\n\f      The district judge's order adopting Dillard's plan in its\n\nentirety also seems to focus on race.                 The judge reasons as\n\nfollows:\n\n      Unlike the city's plans, however, the plaintiffs' plan does\n      everything reasonably possible to maximize black voting\n      strength. If the plaintiffs' plan does not conform to § 2 in\n      providing a complete remedy for minority vote dilution and an\n      equal opportunity for minorities to elect candidates of their\n      choice, it is hard to know what would.\n\n                                       ....\n\n      [T]he court notes that it does not base its decision to adopt\n      the plaintiffs' plan on a finding that the Voting Rights Act\n      can only be complied with if black voters choose black\n      candidates. The purpose of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act is\n      not to assure the election of black candidates.\n\nDillard    v.   Greensboro,   865   F.Supp.    at   778.     The   judge   also\n\nexpresses a troubling reluctance to draw his own plan or tailor\n\nDillard's plan at all:        \"Notwithstanding its preference to avoid\n\ndrawing a new plan, the court would have to undertake that task if\n\nthe plan proposed by the plaintiffs was invalid for some reason.\"\n\nId. at 777. The court's determination that Dillard's redistricting\n\nplan is not invalid is manifestly conclusory.\n\n      The judge emphasized that the Attorney General remarked that\n\na   \"black-supported    candidate,\"      not   a    \"black   candidate,\"   was\n\ndefeated in District 2.        Under    Miller, this distinction is not\n\nvalid because it assumes that all blacks will support the same\n\ncandidate.8        Neither    the   magistrate       judge's    reports    and\n\n      8\n      We acknowledge that the magistrate judge did express some\nconcern over the issue of compactness and respect for political\nsubdivisions during the 1993 hearing and contiguity was discussed\nto some extent in the 1992 hearing. See, e.g., R6-17-18, 46, R7-\n76. In his final order, the district judge concluded that \"the\nplaintiffs' plan does not violate constitutional or statutory\nstandards,\" but he did not make satisfactory evidentiary findings\non this issue. Dillard, 865 F.Supp. at 777.\n\frecommendations nor the district court's orders reflect an adequate\n\nanalysis of the testimony or plans with regard to traditional\n\ndistricting principles. The redistricting plan must be reevaluated\n\nby the district court in light of Miller.9\n\nC. Department of Justice Preclearance\n\n     The Supreme Court in Miller also criticized the Justice\n\nDepartment's preclearance procedures and found it \"inappropriate\n\nfor a court engaged in constitutional scrutiny to accord deference\n\nto the Justice Department's interpretation of the Act.\" Miller, --\n\n- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2491.                The Court found that the\n\nJustice Department had been driven by the objectionable policy of\n\nmaximizing the number of majority black districts rather than\n\n\"grounding its objections [to proposed plans] on evidence of a\n\ndiscriminatory purpose.\"        Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2492.         \"In\n\nutilizing   §   5    to   require   States   to   create   majority-minority\n\ndistricts wherever possible, the Department of Justice expanded its\n\nauthority under the statute beyond what Congress intended and we\n\nhave upheld.\"       Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2493.\n\n     When a federal court reviews a redistricting plan, it intrudes\n\n\"on the most vital of local functions\" and must accord legislatures\n\n     9\n      While neither the magistrate judge nor the district court\nhad the benefit of Miller when evaluating the redistricting\nplans, the Supreme Court's decision in Shaw was available and\nshould have guided the court's reasoning.\n\n          We note that the Supreme Court granted certiorari and\n     heard oral argument in two cases that also may prove to be\n     relevant in the district court's reevaluation of the plan.\n     Shaw v. Hunt, 861 F.Supp. 408 (E.D.N.C.1994), cert. granted\n     --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2639, 132 L.Ed.2d 878 (1995); Vera\n     v. Richards, 861 F.Supp. 1304 (S.D.Tex.1994), cert. granted\n     sub. nom., Bush v. Vera, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2639, 132\n     L.Ed.2d 877 (1995).\n\fthe presumption of good faith \"until a claimant makes a showing\n\nsufficient to support [its] allegation\" that the legislature's\n\ndecisionmaking is race-based.   Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2488.   The\n\ndistrict court made every attempt to defer to the legislature when\n\napproving the 1992 and 1993 plans, but the court found itself\n\nthwarted at each turn by the Attorney General's rejection of those\n\nplans.\n\n     Although we acknowledge that the district court in this case\n\nmust have been frustrated by the Attorney General's rejection of\n\ntwo plans that the court believed to be adequate remedies, the\n\ndistrict court's heavy reliance on finding a plan that will satisfy\n\nthe concerns of the Attorney General conflicts with the admonition\n\nof Miller:\n\n     [O]rdinarily the court would take seriously concerns about\n     packing minorities into districts.      In this situation,\n     however, the Attorney General objected to a district with a\n     black voting age population of 63% because of, among other\n     factors, \"the reduced electoral participation by black\n     persons, which is traceable to a history of discrimination\";\n     therefore, any plan the court adopts to cure that objection\n     will necessarily contain districts with a great many blacks.\n\nDillard, 865 F.Supp. at 778.    From the district court's order, it\n\nis difficult to infer anything other than that the purpose of\n\nadopting Dillard's plan was to satisfy the Attorney General.\n\n                         III. CONCLUSION\n\n     In this appeal, Greensboro challenges the district court's\n\nadoption of Dillard's redistricting plan, which it contends is\n\nracially configured to guarantee the election of black-supported\n\ncandidates.   If the district court determines that race was the\n\npredominant factor in Dillard's redistricting plan, then     Miller\n\nrequires that the plan be subjected to strict scrutiny.       For a\n\fredistricting plan to withstand strict scrutiny under the Voting\n\nRights Act, the racially gerrymandered districts must be found to\n\nbe narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest. Miller, ---\n\nU.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2491.    We emphasize that we are not\n\nexpressing any opinion as to whether the Dillard plan ultimately\n\nwill meet the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause.    Our\n\ndecision is limited to the conclusion that because neither the\n\nmagistrate judge nor the district court had the benefit of Miller\n\nwith its reiteration of the importance of examining principles of\n\ncompactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions in\n\nanalyzing the redistricting plan, it is necessary to remand the\n\ncase.\n\n     We VACATE the decision of the district court and REMAND this\n\ncase for a reevaluation of the proposed redistricting plans in\n\nlight of Miller.\n\f",

Because the district court did not\n\nhave       the   benefit of   Miller     when   it   adopted   the   challenged\n\nredistricting plan, we remand the case to allow the district court\n\nto reevaluate the plan under Miller.\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Over a decade ago, this case originated as a class-action\n\nbrought by black citizens of Alabama (\"Dillard\") to challenge the\n\n\n\n\n       *\n      Honorable Joseph F. Weis, Jr., Senior U.S. Circuit Judge\nfor the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\fat-large voting systems1 used to elect county commissioners in nine\n\nAlabama counties.2      In 1987, Dillard amended the complaint by\n\nadding the City of Greensboro, Alabama (\"Greensboro\"),3 among other\ncities, counties and county school boards, as a defendant and\n\nalleging that the at-large system used to elect the Greensboro city\n\ncouncil violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as\n\namended, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1994).        Section 2 provides that no state\n\nor political subdivision may impose or apply a voting qualification\n\nor prerequisite to voting or any standard, practice, or procedure\n\nthat \"results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any\n\ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(a).        Dillard claims that, under the at-large\n\nsystem, \"the political processes ... are not equally open to\n\nparticipation     by   [blacks]   ...    in     that   [blacks]   have   less\n\nopportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in\n\nthe   political   process   and   to    elect   representatives    of    their\n\nchoice.\"   42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).\n\n\n      1\n      At-large voting systems use multimember voting districts\nwhere constituents vote for more than one candidate, and all\nelected candidates represent the same district rather than their\nindividual districts. This system often makes it difficult for\nminority groups to elect candidates of their choice because they\ndo not make up a majority of the population. Such a procedure\nalso is known to result in a dilution of voting power. See\nRogers v.

Blacks comprise 62% of the population and 56% of the\nvoting age population.\n\f     Pursuant to a 1987 consent decree, Greensboro conceded that\n\nits at-large system violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 4\nTo   remedy    this   violation,    Greensboro     and    Dillard    submitted\n\ncompeting     redistricting   plans.     R1-1-1;         Supp.   R1-492.   The\n\ndistrict court referred the case to a United States magistrate\n\njudge to serve as a special master in the case.              Two evidentiary\n\nhearings were conducted by the magistrate judge in 1988, but no\n\nredistricting plan was adopted.         In May 1992, the parties agreed\n\nthat the plans that had been submitted to the court in 1988 could\n\nno longer be used because of demographic changes identified in the\n\n1990 census. Consequently, new plans were submitted by Dillard and\n\nGreensboro.        The   court     adopted   Greensboro's        single-member\n\ndistricting plan on an interim basis.5\n\n     Greensboro conducted municipal elections in 1992 pursuant to\n\nthis interim plan.\n\n     The 1992 plan had five districts; in three of them, African-\n     Americans were a majority of the voting age population.\n     District 1 contained a black voting age population of 83%;\n     District 2 contained a black voting age population of 58%;\n     and District 3 contained a black voting age population of 75%.\n     Districts 1 and 3 elected black councilmembers in 1992, and\n     District 2 elected a white candidate over a black candidate.\n\nDillard v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 774 (M.D.Ala.1994).\n\n     4\n      The parties in the amended class action agreed for the\ndistrict court to treat 165 out of the 183 jurisdictions\nchallenged as individual lawsuits, with separate files and civil\naction numbers. Greensboro is one of those 165 jurisdictions.\nDillard v. Baldwin County Bd. of Edu., 686 F.Supp. at 1461.\n     5\n      Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires that the United\nStates Attorney General preclear any plan proposed by a State or\npolitical subdivision that is subject to 42 U.S.C. § 1973b. 42\nU.S.C. § 1973c. The Code of Federal Regulations, however,\nprovides that a federal court may authorize the emergency interim\nuse of a redistricting plan without first getting approval of the\nAttorney General. 28 C.F.R. § 51.18(c) (1995).\n\fIn December 1992, the Attorney General concluded that the 1992 plan\n\nimproperly \"fragmented black population concentrations in order to\n\nlower the black percentage in District 2,\" and refused to preclear\n\nthe plan.   R2-66-2 (emphasis added).     The Attorney General pointed\n\nto the fact that \"a black-supported candidate in District 2 was\n\ndefeated\" as evidence of racial gerrymandering.          Id.\n\n     In   August   1993,   Greensboro   submitted   a   new    plan   to   the\n\nAttorney General for preclearance.        The 1993 plan created three\n\nmajority-black districts.     District 1 contained a black voting age\n\npopulation of 83%;         District 2 contained a black voting age\n\npopulation of 63%;     and District 3 contained a black voting age\n\npopulation of 73%.     Once again, the Attorney General refused to\n\npreclear the plan under section 5.         The Attorney General found\n\nthat, although the black voting age population of District 2 had\n\nbeen increased from 58% to 63%, the 1993 plan still improperly\n\nhindered blacks from electing candidates of their choice.                  The\n\nAttorney General made the following observations:\n\n     [T]he opportunity for black voters to elect a representative\n     of their choice in [District 2] appears to have been\n     constrained deliberately, taking into account the continued\n     fragmentation of black population concentrations, the pattern\n     of racially polarized voting and the reduced electoral\n     participation by black persons, which is traceable to a\n     history of discrimination.\n\n          The city has provided no satisfactory explanation for\n     limiting black electoral opportunities in this manner.\n     Indeed, the city was aware of several alternative plans that\n     created three districts in which black voters constituted a\n     greater majority of the voting age population in a third\n     district than in proposed District 2. While the city was not\n     required under the Voting Rights Act to adopt any specific\n     alternative plan, it is not free to adopt a districting plan\n     which, as would appear here, is calculated to limit black\n     voting strength.\n\nR2-90-Attach. at 2.\n\f     In January 1994, Dillard filed a renewed motion for further\n\nrelief and requested that the magistrate judge recommend adopting\n\nDillard's plan, submitted twice previously, in 1991 and 1993.   On\n\nOctober 11, 1994, the district court approved the magistrate\n\njudge's recommendation, adopted the single-member redistricting\n\nplan proposed by Dillard, and ordered immediate new elections.6\n\nThe plan adopted by the district court in 1994 and currently at\n\nissue in this appeal has three majority-black districts containing\n\nblack voting age populations in the respective districts of 85%,\n\n80% and 76%.   Greensboro claims that the district court erred in\n\nadopting Dillard's plan because it allegedly is a race-conscious\n\neffort to guarantee direct proportionality of representation by\n\nmanipulating district lines.7\n\n                           II. ANALYSIS\n\n     The issue before this court is whether the redistricting plan\n\nproposed by Dillard and approved by the district court in 1994\n\n     6\n      A plan prepared and adopted by a federal court to remedy a\nsection 2 violation is not subject to the preclearance\nrequirements of section 5.

In 1991, the Georgia General Assembly submitted a\n\fcongressional        redistricting      plan    to    the       Attorney           General   for\n\npreclearance as required by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nId. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2483.              The plan called for an increase in\n\nthe number of majority-black districts from one to two.                               Id.    The\n\nAttorney   General      refused       preclearance,         however,          and     \"noted    a\n\nconcern    that      Georgia    had    created       only       two        majority-minority\n\ndistricts, and that the proposed plan did not \"recognize' certain\n\nminority populations by placing them in a majority-black district.\"\n\nId. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2483-84 (citation omitted).                              The General\n\nAssembly then submitted a second plan to the Attorney General for\n\npreclearance, but the Justice Department, concluding \"that Georgia\n\nhad \"failed to explain adequately' its failure to create a third\n\nmajority-minority district,\" again refused preclearance. Id. at --\n\n--, 115 S.Ct. at 2484 (citation omitted).                   For the third time, the\n\nGeneral    Assembly      attempted      to     create       a    plan        that    would     be\n\nacceptable      to     the     Attorney       General.                It     created     three\n\nmajority-minority districts using as a model the \"max-black\" plan\n\nproffered by the American Civil Liberties Union.                             Id.    This final\n\nplan formed an Eleventh District that was drawn predominantly based\n\non race.      Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2485.\n\n     The      Court    began    its    analysis       of        the    Georgia        plan     by\n\nsummarizing its holding in a previous redistricting case, Shaw v.\n\nReno, --- U.S. ----, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112905\"><a href=\"/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In     Miller, the Court\n\nclarified Shaw:       \"Just as the State may not, absent extraordinary\n\njustification, segregate citizens on the basis of race in its\n\npublic parks ... so did we recognize in Shaw that it may not\n\nseparate its citizens into different voting districts on the basis\n\nof race.\"      Miller, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2486 (citations\n\nomitted).      In     Miller,   the   Court    warned    federal      courts    that\n\nreviewing redistricting legislation \"represents a serious intrusion\n\non the most vital of local functions.\"            Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at\n\n2488.   The Court also noted that it is often difficult for a court\n\nto distinguish \"between being aware of racial considerations and\n\nbeing motivated by them.\"        Id.\n\nB. District Court's Analysis of the Plan\n\n     Dillard attempts to distinguish this case from Miller by\n\narguing   in    his    supplemental    brief    that,        unlike   Miller,    the\n\nGreensboro plan was adopted by a federal district court, not a\n\nlegislature.        We do not find any merit in this distinction.\n\nWhether a redistricting plan is adopted by a court or a legislature\n\ndoes not affect a party's right to challenge the plan. Admittedly,\n\nwe are faced with an unusual factual situation here.                      In most\n\nvoting rights cases, the redistricting plan that is challenged is\n\none developed by a legislature.          Here, the plan was developed by\n\nDillard, adopted by the district court, and is now challenged by\n\nGreensboro.      Despite the unusual posture of the case, however, we\n\ffind that Greensboro has equal standing with Dillard to challenge\n\nthe district court's plan.\n\n     If   the   district       court   determines     on   remand    that   racial\n\ngerrymandering exists, then the redistricting plan will be the\n\nsubject of strict scrutiny.            Under the strict scrutiny test, the\n\nplan must be shown to be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling\n\nstate interest.     This test will be satisfied if evidence of past\n\ndiscrimination is shown and there is a sufficient evidentiary basis\n\nto establish that the plan is narrowly tailored to remedy that\n\ndiscrimination.     Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2491.\n\n     The Supreme Court requires that district courts evaluate\n\nredistricting     plans    in     terms    of      \"traditional      race-neutral\n\ndistricting principles, including but not limited to compactness,\n\ncontiguity,     respect   for    political       subdivisions   or   communities\n\ndefined by actual shared interests.\"               Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at\n\n2488.     Our   review    of    the    record,    particularly      the   hearings\n\nconducted by the magistrate judge in 1988, 1992 and 1993, show an\n\noverwhelming emphasis on race with little or no examination of\n\nrace-neutral districting principles.              Particularly disturbing is\n\nthe testimony regarding the propensity of black voters allegedly to\n\nvote only for black candidates:\n\n     Q: Mr. Gray, you are taking it as a given that in a black\n     majority district, the voters, if you endorse a black\n     candidate because of his race, that the voters should likewise\n     favor the black candidate simply because he is black?\n\n     A: That's probably a fair assessment.\n\n                                        ....\n\n     Q: [The COURT]: Under your plan [the plan ultimately adopted\n     by the district court], you're guaranteed three black council\n     persons.\n\f     A: [Jerome GRAY]:   Yes.\n\nR6-60;    R6-72.\n\n     Q: [Def. Counsel]: Well, do you agree or disagree that your\n     plan you favor is certainly a form of gerrymandering, with the\n     view of achieving very high majorities of black voters?\n\n     A: [Singleton, resident of Greensboro]: I would disagree with\n     you.\n\n     Q: Well, isn't that its purpose, to achieve and to obtain very\n     high majorities of black voters, in excess of 80 percent, in\n     at least three of the council districts?\n\n     A: Sure, it is.\n\n     Q: And to do that, you've drawn very specific lines to achieve\n     that purpose?\n\n     A: Yes.\n\nR7-36.\n\n     Q [The Court]: What is it about this plan that the City has\n     proposed that leads you to believe that in District 2,\n     African-Americans would not have an opportunity to elect a\n     candidate of their choice?\n\n     A [Singleton]: Well, I think that in District 2, that the\n     City has not really looked at the majority voting age in that\n     community, and based on the lives [sic] in which it was drawn,\n     we feel that there was not enough people, African-Americans,\n     in that district based on their lines, to successfully elect\n     an African-American in that district.\n\nR7-48-49. This testimony reflects precisely the racially pejorative\n\npredisposition that the Supreme Court sought to eradicate in\n\nMiller:\n\n     When the State assigns voters on the basis of race, it engages\n     in the offensive and demeaning assumption that voters of a\n     particular race, because of their race, \"think alike, share\n     the same political interests, and will prefer the same\n     candidates at the polls.\" ... Race-based assignments \"embody\n     stereotypes that treat individuals as the product of their\n     race, evaluating their thoughts and efforts—their very worth\n     as citizens—according to a criterion barred to the Government\n     by history and the Constitution.\"\n\nMiller, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2486 (citations omitted).\n\f      The district judge's order adopting Dillard's plan in its\n\nentirety also seems to focus on race.                 The judge reasons as\n\nfollows:\n\n      Unlike the city's plans, however, the plaintiffs' plan does\n      everything reasonably possible to maximize black voting\n      strength. If the plaintiffs' plan does not conform to § 2 in\n      providing a complete remedy for minority vote dilution and an\n      equal opportunity for minorities to elect candidates of their\n      choice, it is hard to know what would.\n\n                                       ....\n\n      [T]he court notes that it does not base its decision to adopt\n      the plaintiffs' plan on a finding that the Voting Rights Act\n      can only be complied with if black voters choose black\n      candidates. The purpose of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act is\n      not to assure the election of black candidates.\n\nDillard    v.   Greensboro,   865   F.Supp.    at   778.     The   judge   also\n\nexpresses a troubling reluctance to draw his own plan or tailor\n\nDillard's plan at all:        \"Notwithstanding its preference to avoid\n\ndrawing a new plan, the court would have to undertake that task if\n\nthe plan proposed by the plaintiffs was invalid for some reason.\"\n\nId. at 777. The court's determination that Dillard's redistricting\n\nplan is not invalid is manifestly conclusory.\n\n      The judge emphasized that the Attorney General remarked that\n\na   \"black-supported    candidate,\"      not   a    \"black   candidate,\"   was\n\ndefeated in District 2.        Under    Miller, this distinction is not\n\nvalid because it assumes that all blacks will support the same\n\ncandidate.8        Neither    the   magistrate       judge's    reports    and\n\n      8\n      We acknowledge that the magistrate judge did express some\nconcern over the issue of compactness and respect for political\nsubdivisions during the 1993 hearing and contiguity was discussed\nto some extent in the 1992 hearing. See, e.g., R6-17-18, 46, R7-\n76. In his final order, the district judge concluded that \"the\nplaintiffs' plan does not violate constitutional or statutory\nstandards,\" but he did not make satisfactory evidentiary findings\non this issue. Dillard, 865 F.Supp. at 777.\n\frecommendations nor the district court's orders reflect an adequate\n\nanalysis of the testimony or plans with regard to traditional\n\ndistricting principles. The redistricting plan must be reevaluated\n\nby the district court in light of Miller.9\n\nC. Department of Justice Preclearance\n\n     The Supreme Court in Miller also criticized the Justice\n\nDepartment's preclearance procedures and found it \"inappropriate\n\nfor a court engaged in constitutional scrutiny to accord deference\n\nto the Justice Department's interpretation of the Act.\" Miller, --\n\n- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2491.                The Court found that the\n\nJustice Department had been driven by the objectionable policy of\n\nmaximizing the number of majority black districts rather than\n\n\"grounding its objections [to proposed plans] on evidence of a\n\ndiscriminatory purpose.\"        Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2492.         \"In\n\nutilizing   §   5    to   require   States   to   create   majority-minority\n\ndistricts wherever possible, the Department of Justice expanded its\n\nauthority under the statute beyond what Congress intended and we\n\nhave upheld.\"       Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2493.\n\n     When a federal court reviews a redistricting plan, it intrudes\n\n\"on the most vital of local functions\" and must accord legislatures\n\n     9\n      While neither the magistrate judge nor the district court\nhad the benefit of Miller when evaluating the redistricting\nplans, the Supreme Court's decision in Shaw was available and\nshould have guided the court's reasoning.\n\n          We note that the Supreme Court granted certiorari and\n     heard oral argument in two cases that also may prove to be\n     relevant in the district court's reevaluation of the plan.\n     Shaw v.

Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2488.   The\n\ndistrict court made every attempt to defer to the legislature when\n\napproving the 1992 and 1993 plans, but the court found itself\n\nthwarted at each turn by the Attorney General's rejection of those\n\nplans.\n\n     Although we acknowledge that the district court in this case\n\nmust have been frustrated by the Attorney General's rejection of\n\ntwo plans that the court believed to be adequate remedies, the\n\ndistrict court's heavy reliance on finding a plan that will satisfy\n\nthe concerns of the Attorney General conflicts with the admonition\n\nof Miller:\n\n     [O]rdinarily the court would take seriously concerns about\n     packing minorities into districts.      In this situation,\n     however, the Attorney General objected to a district with a\n     black voting age population of 63% because of, among other\n     factors, \"the reduced electoral participation by black\n     persons, which is traceable to a history of discrimination\";\n     therefore, any plan the court adopts to cure that objection\n     will necessarily contain districts with a great many blacks.\n\nDillard, 865 F.Supp. at 778.    From the district court's order, it\n\nis difficult to infer anything other than that the purpose of\n\nadopting Dillard's plan was to satisfy the Attorney General.\n\n                         III. CONCLUSION\n\n     In this appeal, Greensboro challenges the district court's\n\nadoption of Dillard's redistricting plan, which it contends is\n\nracially configured to guarantee the election of black-supported\n\ncandidates.   If the district court determines that race was the\n\npredominant factor in Dillard's redistricting plan, then     Miller\n\nrequires that the plan be subjected to strict scrutiny.       For a\n\fredistricting plan to withstand strict scrutiny under the Voting\n\nRights Act, the racially gerrymandered districts must be found to\n\nbe narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest. Miller, ---\n\nU.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2491.    We emphasize that we are not\n\nexpressing any opinion as to whether the Dillard plan ultimately\n\nwill meet the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause.    Our\n\ndecision is limited to the conclusion that because neither the\n\nmagistrate judge nor the district court had the benefit of Miller\n\nwith its reiteration of the importance of examining principles of\n\ncompactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions in\n\nanalyzing the redistricting plan, it is necessary to remand the\n\ncase.\n\n     We VACATE the decision of the district court and REMAND this\n\ncase for a reevaluation of the proposed redistricting plans in\n\nlight of Miller.\n\f</pre>",
