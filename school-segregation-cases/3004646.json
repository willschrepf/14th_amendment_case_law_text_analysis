Donnersberger,\n       Defendant-Appellee.                                         )   Judge Presiding\n\n\n       PRESIDING JUSTICE McBRIDE delivered the opinion of the court:\n\n       In 1999, Albert C. Hanna sued the City of Chicago, complaining that real property he\n\nowned in the Lincoln Central neighborhood was unconstitutionally downzoned from R5 to SD-\n\n19 by the city council’s amendment of the municipal zoning ordinance. Although the circuit\n\ncourt dismissed Hanna’s first amended complaint for failure to state a claim and failure to give\n\nnotice to all property owners within 250 feet of the property, we reversed the ruling in part and\n\nremanded the cause in mid 2002 for further proceedings. Hanna v. City of Chicago, 331 Ill. App.\n\n3d 295 (2002), appeal denied, 201 Ill. 2d 566 (2002). On remand, Hanna twice stated in written\n\nopposition to motions filed by the City that the “ultimate” and “effective” relief he was seeking\n\nwas reversion to the R5 category, or its current equivalent, RM5. In 2006, the city council\n\nrezoned Hanna’s neighborhood to RM5 and the circuit court dismissed his action as moot.\n\nHanna argues his action is not moot or should be addressed under the public interest exception to\n\nthe mootness doctrine.\n\n       The following facts come from our prior opinion and the record currently on appeal. The\n\f1-06-3348\n\nLincoln Central neighborhood is north of downtown Chicago in the 43rd aldermanic ward, and is\n\ngenerally bounded on the west by Halstead Street, on the northeast by Lincoln Avenue, on the\n\nsoutheast by the former Ogden Avenue, and on the south by North Avenue. There are at least\n\n3,500 dwelling units within its boundaries. Hanna’s property consists of four lots located at\n\n1742-50 North Mohawk Street. He purchased the lots in 1971 and erected a five-story brick\n\napartment building containing 26 units. At the time, the neighborhood was zoned R5, with no\n\nbuilding height restrictions, and the minimum lot area (MLA) per dwelling was 400 square feet\n\nwith a maximum floor area ratio (FAR) of 2.2 (allowing construction of buildings roughly 2.2\n\ntimes the size of the lot).\n\n        The zoning remained R5 until 1998, when the city council amended the municipal zoning\n\nordinance with an “overlay district” applicable to Lincoln Central called the “Lincoln Central\n\nSpecial District” or SD-19, which enhanced the restrictions on new construction in the\n\nneighborhood. Under SD-19, the building height was limited to 43 feet, the MLA was increased\n\nto 1,000 feet, and the FAR was reduced to 1.7. In practical terms, the rezoning reduced the size\n\nand bulk of new buildings and decreased the density of new dwelling units. According to Hanna,\n\nthe 1998 rezoning was done at the urging of various property owners who formed a\n\nneighborhood association known as the Lincoln Central Association.1 On June 4, 1999, Hanna\n\n\n        1\n            Hanna does not reside in the 26-unit apartment building, but instead makes his home\n\nless than two miles north in a three-story single-family residence at 541 West Deming Place.\n\nHanna brought a separate action against the City when the Deming Place property was rezoned in\n\n1997 from R5 to R4. Hanna prevailed in the Deming Place rezoning action; however, his\n\n                                                 2\n\f1-06-3348\n\nbegan the current lawsuit, alleging that the rezoning to SD-19 violated his rights under the\n\nIllinois Constitution. Hanna indicated he did not intend to redevelop his property, but the\n\nrezoning rendered his Mohawk Street apartment building a nonconforming structure and\n\ndeprived him of the highest and best possible use of his property. Hanna’s lawsuit had been\n\npending for five years when the City did away with SD-19, first by adopting on May 27, 2004, a\n\nnew Chicago Zoning Ordinance which abolished all “R” zoning categories in Chicago in favor of\n\nnew categories (Chicago Municipal Code §17-1-1406-A (eff. August 1, 2004)), and later that\n\nyear, on November 3, 2004, by recategorizing the neighborhood as RM4.5. Hanna, however,\n\namended his complaint, for the seventh time, in order to add claims against the 2004 rezoning to\n\nRM4.5. As we stated earlier, when the City filed motions for partial summary judgment and\n\ndismissal of Hanna’s seventh amended complaint, he responded that the “effective” and\n\n“ultimate” relief he had been seeking was reversion to R5 or its current equivalent RM5. More\n\n\npetition for approximately $1 million in attorney fees and $160,000 in costs was denied, and we\n\nrejected his appeal. Hanna v. City of Chicago, No. 1-01-3093 (2005) (unpublished order under\n\nSupreme Court Rule 23), appeal denied, 215 Ill. 2d 596 (2005). Hanna also unsuccessful sued to\n\nrecover those fees and costs in federal court. Hanna v. City of Chicago, No. 03-C-2321 (N.D.\n\nIll., August 27, 2003). He also turned to the courts in 1987 when he sued his Deming Place\n\nneighbor to enforce the subdivision’s 50-foot building setback line created in 1860. Hanna v.\n\nAmerican National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago, 266 Ill. App. 3d 544 (1994), appeal denied,\n\n158 Ill. 2d 551 (1994). Hanna owns a 24-unit apartment building at 1216-1220 North Dearborn\n\nAvenue which is not affected by the zoning for Lincoln Central or Deming environs.\n\n                                                 3\n\f1-06-3348\n\nspecifically, in a response brief filed January 28, 2005, to the City’s motion for partial summary\n\njudgment, Hanna stated:\n\n               “[I]f the Court finds both [RM4.5] and SD19 invalid, the zoning\n\n               will revert back to its pre-SD19 zoning of R5 (or its current\n\n               equivalent of RM5), by operation of law.\n\n                       This is the ultimate relief Hanna has been seeking all along,\n\n               and is thus ‘effective’ for him.” (Emphasis in original.)\n\nHanna repeated these statements in the response brief he filed May 27, 2005, to the City’s motion\n\nto dismiss and strike certain counts in Hanna’s then-current pleading.\n\n       In late 2005, the alderman of the 43rd Ward sought to change the neighborhood’s zoning\n\nfrom RM4.5 to RM5, which would increase the maximum building height to 45 feet and the\n\nFAR to 2.0. After notification letters had been sent out by the City and a community meeting\n\nwas convened and attended by approximately 80 residents, the alderman sent property owners a\n\nsecond notification, which included more detail and a request for further community input\n\nregarding the rezoning. The alderman indicated the Lincoln Central neighborhood association\n\n“worked very hard” to help establish the SD-19 zoning and that the City was spending\n\nconsiderable public resources defending the classification in litigation with an unnamed plaintiff.\n\nSix years of litigation had been “protracted and expensive” and a trial would add to those costs\n\nand possibly result in “an unwelcome decision if the plaintiff were to prevail.” The City’s\n\nDepartment of Planning and Development and Department of Law were recommending that the\n\nlitigation be resolved expeditiously by rezoning to RM5, and the alderman had begrudgingly\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f1-06-3348\n\nagreed, even though “[m]any people in the neighborhood would like to see more restrictive not\n\nless restrictive zoning regulations.” According to notes from the December 13, 2005, meeting of\n\nthe zoning committee of the Lincoln Central Association, the neighborhood organization\n\nsupported the proposed rezoning, with the caveat that if “the lawsuit continue[d] in spite of this\n\nupzoning, [the group] would request that zoning be returned to RM4.5.\" On January 11, 2006,\n\nthe city council passed the RM5 zoning amendment, which became effective on February 8,\n\n2006.\n\n        Hanna, nevertheless, filed an eighth amended complaint, adding claims against the 2006\n\nrezoning and restating his claims against the 1998 and 2004 changes. In 3 of the 11 counts, he\n\nsought judicial declarations that one or all of the rezonings violated his constitutional rights to\n\nsubstantive and procedural due process and equal protection under the law and constituted\n\nimpermissible spot zoning, and in the remaining eight counts, he sought to permanently enjoin\n\nenforcement of the rezonings. The City responded with a motion to dismiss the action, arguing\n\nHanna’s claims had been mooted by the latest rezoning and that the courts were unable to grant\n\nhim any further relief. The City cited Hanna’s statements regarding his “ultimate” and\n\n“effective” relief, characterized these statements as judicial admissions, and argued that Hanna\n\nhad obtained what he had been seeking. The City further argued that in any event, the court\n\ncould not grant Hanna any additional relief because the original R5 zoning category had been\n\nabolished by the City’s adoption of the new Chicago Zoning Ordinance, which Hanna was not\n\nchallenging, 2 and no existing zoning category would grant rights equivalent to the old R5\n\n\n        2\n            Hanna did attempt to challenge the constitutionality of the new Chicago Zoning\n\n                                                  5\n\f1-06-3348\n\nclassification. In response, Hanna conceded, “The City has, technically, ‘mooted’ Hanna’s\n\npersonal claim for a rezoning to R-5, or RM-5,\" but he contended his statements identifying RM5\n\nas his “ultimate relief” were mere legal conclusions instead of judicial admissions, and that his\n\naction was not moot because the City had not met its burden of “an absolute clear showing that\n\nthe wrongful conduct alleged [could] not be expected to recur.” Hanna also contended the 2006\n\nrezoning amounted to “legislative sl[e]ight of hand” aimed solely at ending his lawsuit, which he\n\nargued was an improper, unconstitutional motivation. In the alternative, Hanna argued his action\n\nshould be addressed under the public interest exception to mootness, in order to give future\n\nguidance to City officials regarding the constitutionality of the municipality’s zoning policies and\n\npractices. The circuit court granted the City’s motion to dismiss on October 17, 2006, ruling that\n\nthe statements regarding Hanna’s relief were binding judicial admissions, that the 2006 rezoning\n\neffectively granted Hanna all his requested relief and was not done for an improper purpose, that\n\nthe 2006 rezoning mooted the action because the City was not asserting the constitutionality of\n\nthe 1998 and 2004 rezoning or its right to enforce those rezonings in the future, and that the\n\naction did not warrant application of the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine.\n\n       The granting of a motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2-619(a)(9) of the Code of Civil\n\n\nOrdinance, which in relevant part rezoned all R5 property to RM5. That separate action, Hanna\n\nv. City of Chicago, No. 06-CH-23366, was dismissed by Judge Kathleen M. Pantle on June 12,\n\n2007, due to Hanna’s admitted failure to comply with the notice provision in section 11-13-8 of\n\nthe Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-13-8 (West 2006)). Hanna is currently appealing the\n\ndismissal (No. 1-07-1960) and recently filed his opening appellate brief.\n\n                                                 6\n\f1-06-3348\n\nProcedure is reviewed de novo. Sadler v. Creekmur, 354 Ill. App. 3d 1029, 1039 (2004); 735\n\nILCS 5/2-619(a)(9) (West 2006). Dismissal pursuant to section 2-619(a)(9) should be entered\n\nwhen the plaintiff’s claim is barred by “affirmative matter avoiding the legal effect of or\n\ndefeating the claim” (735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(9) (West 2006)), such as when a defense is presented\n\nthat “negates an alleged cause of action completely.” ChiCorp, Inc. v. Bower, 336 Ill. App. 3d\n\n132, 136 (2002). When the issues have ceased to exist and there is no longer an actual\n\ncontroversy between the parties, the alleged cause of action has been negated and should be\n\ndismissed as moot. People ex rel. Newdelman v. Weaver, 50 Ill. 2d 237, 241 (1972). Mootness\n\noccurs once the plaintiff has secured what he basically sought and a resolution of the issues could\n\nnot have any practical effect on the existing controversy. Newdelman, 50 Ill. 2d at 241. A\n\nmooted action should be dismissed out of “concern that parties to a resolved dispute lack a\n\nsufficient personal stake in the outcome to assure that there is an adversarial relationship that\n\nsharpens the presentation of issues upon which the courts largely depend for illumination of\n\ndifficult questions.” Fisch v. Loews Cineplex Theatres, Inc., 365 Ill. App. 3d 537, 539 (2005).\n\n       In ChiCorp, for example, the plaintiff filed suit against the Illinois Department of\n\nRevenue seeking income taxes and interest paid under protest and an order stating that the statute\n\nwhich required these payments was unconstitutional. ChiCorp, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 135. The\n\nDepartment prevailed on a section 2-619(a)(9) motion to dismiss the action on the basis of\n\nmootness, in which it stated it would return the money paid, plus interest, and would not attempt\n\nto recover those funds in the future from the plaintiff. ChiCorp, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 135-36; 735\n\nILCS 5/2-619(a)(9) (West 2000). On appeal, the plaintiff contended it was nonetheless entitled\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f1-06-3348\n\nto a judicial determination of the correctness of the tax statute, regardless of the Department’s\n\ndecision not to assess the tax. ChiCorp, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 136. The appellate court rejected this\n\ncontention because the pleadings and facts of the case showed that the parties were in agreement\n\nabout the disposition of the money, which meant “there was no longer an actual case or\n\ncontroversy existing between the parties.” ChiCorp, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 137. A decision\n\nregarding the additional issues, when there was no longer a controversy before the court, would\n\nhave resulted in an improper, advisory opinion. ChiCorp, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 137.\n\n       Another relevant example is Duncan Publishing, Inc. v. City of Chicago, 304 Ill. App. 3d\n\n778, 780-82 (1999), where a publisher sought the production of certain public records from\n\nvarious departments of the City of Chicago pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act\n\n(5 ILCS 140/1 et seq. (West 1996)), and received the last of them after filing suit. The appellate\n\npanel affirmed the entry of summary judgment for City, reasoning that any controversy over the\n\nCity’s production of documents “clearly ceased to exist once the City tendered those documents\n\nto [the publisher].” Duncan Publishing, 304 Ill. App. 3d at 782. Although the plaintiff also\n\nsought costs and attorney fees, the appellate court characterized the request as an ancillary issue\n\nwhich did not rescue the substantive issue from mootness. Duncan Publishing, 304 Ill. App. 3d\n\nat 782-83.\n\n       Hanna’s first specific contention is that a defendant cannot render an action moot merely\n\nby voluntarily ceasing the challenged conduct and bears the burden of making an “absolutely\n\nclear” showing that the conduct could not reasonably be expected to recur. Cohan v. CityCorp,\n\n266 Ill. App. 3d 626, 629 (1993). See also Fryzel v. Chicago Title & Trust Co., 173 Ill. App. 3d\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f1-06-3348\n\n788, 794 (1988) (mere voluntary cessation of allegedly unlawful conduct cannot moot a case, as\n\nthe defendant would then be free to resume the practices complained of). He points to the fact\n\nthat the Lincoln Central neighborhood group supported the 2006 rezoning to RM5 and contends\n\nthe group has “threatened to rezone his Property again if the rezoning *** does not end [this\n\nlitigation].” He also emphasizes that his real estate has been rezoned three times in the last\n\ndecade and cites a statement Paul Woznicki made when he was deposed in connection with this\n\nsuit on July 29, 2004, “[W]hen I was the zoning administrator, they were up 400 [sic] -- 450\n\namendments made just to the maps, and I heard that that’s mushroomed to six or seven hundred\n\nor eight hundred annually.” Hanna concludes the City failed to meet its burden and that the\n\nmotion to dismiss his 11-count complaint should have been denied on this point alone. We do\n\nnot find Hanna’s argument persuasive because the facts and relevant case law are not in his\n\nfavor.\n\n         Hanna’s allegations regarding the 1998 and 2004 rezonings are indisputably moot\n\nbecause those zoning ordinances no longer exist and the City has expressed no intention to\n\nenforce them. Pertinent here is Village of Palatine v. LaSalle National Bank, 112 Ill. App. 3d\n\n885, 887-88 (1983), in which a real estate developer challenged a municipal flood plain\n\nordinance and building height ordinance which together prevented the construction of phases II\n\nand III of the Baybrook apartment complex on a 35-acre tract in Palatine, Illinois. The trial judge\n\ndeclared both ordinances invalid as applied to the Baybrook project and enjoined the\n\nmunicipality from enforcing them. Village of Palatine, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 890. The municipality\n\nappealed, but also amended its flood plain ordinance by adopting the most recent Illinois\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f1-06-3348\n\nDepartment of Transportation Flood Plain maps. Village of Palatine, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 890.\n\nUnder those maps, the Baybrook construction project was no longer in a designated flood plain.\n\nVillage of Palatine, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 890. The change ended the appeal as to the flood plain\n\nordinance, because “courts will not determine the question of the validity of an ordinance which\n\nis no longer in force and which can not be applied to the complaining parties.” Village of\n\nPalatine, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 891. The only issue to be decided was the validity of the\n\nunamended building height ordinance. Village of Palatine, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 892. Given that\n\nthe 1998 and 2004 zoning ordinances no longer exist, we should not determine their validity.\n\nFurthermore, Hanna is relying on cases which are readily distinguishable. In the first case, the\n\ndefendant banks agreed to waive the service fee at issue, but “maintain[ed] the right to assess the\n\nvery same charge” in the future.” Cohan, 266 Ill. App. 3d at 630. In the second case, the\n\ndefendant trust company agreed to let state examiners review certain account records, but\n\n“continue[d] to insist upon the right to withhold such accounts” and “inescapably le[ft] open the\n\npossibility that [it might] refuse a similar examination in the future.” Fryzel, 173 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n794. In contrast, the current defendant is not asserting the constitutionality of the 1998 or 2004\n\nrezoning to Hanna’s property, nor its right to enforce those rezonings in the future. The present\n\nappeal is also analogous to the one described in Fisch, in which the plaintiffs sought an\n\ninjunction requiring a national chain of movie theaters to publish the approximate length or the\n\nspecific start time of commercial advertisements, movie previews, and feature films, so that\n\nconsumers would not unwittingly arrive early and become a captive audience to advertisers.\n\nFisch, 365 Ill. App. 3d at 537-38. The circuit court dismissed the action as one based on a de\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f1-06-3348\n\nminimis injury (Fisch, 365 Ill. App. 3d at 538), and the appellate court never reached the\n\narguments regarding this ruling, because during the appellate process, any actual controversy\n\nended when the national chain began publishing its movie listings with the statement that “ ‘the\n\nfeature presentation will start 10 or 15 minutes after the published showtime.’ ” Fisch, 365 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 539. Once the plaintiffs had secured what they sought -- reasonable notice of the true\n\nstarting times of movies shown at the defendants’ theaters -- the controversy ended. Fisch, 365\n\nIll. App. 3d at 540. Like Hanna, the plaintiffs argued their action was not moot, because without\n\nan injunction the national chain was free to reverse its policy at any point in time. Fisch, 365 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 540. Nevertheless, the court did not find this argument persuasive because the\n\nnational chain “ha[d] not asserted, insisted upon, or maintained the right to omit reasonable\n\nnotice of the actual starting times from their movie listings in the future,” and had instead\n\npublicly announced its new policy and notified an Illinois legislator of the policy’s\n\nimplementation. Fisch, 365 Ill. App. 3d at 540. Considering the facts in light of this precedent,\n\nwe conclude the voluntary cessation doctrine does not aid Hanna’s appeal regarding the 1998 and\n\n2004 rezonings.\n\n       With respect to the 2006 rezoning, Hanna is relying primarily on the meeting minutes of\n\nthe Lincoln Central neighborhood association which indicate that if rezoning to RM5 did not end\n\nthis lawsuit, the group would ask for their neighborhood be returned to the RM4.5 designation.\n\nThe meeting minutes do not help Hanna because the group will not act on its intention if we\n\naffirm the trial court’s mootness finding. More importantly, the community association does not\n\nhave the power to rezone the neighborhood and it does not speak for the City. The fact that the\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f1-06-3348\n\ncity council has rezoned Lincoln Central and other neighborhoods in the recent past does not\n\nsuggest the city council intends to rezone Lincoln Central in the future, particularly when the\n\ncurrent rezoning has resulted in the dismissal of what the local alderman deemed a “protracted\n\nand expensive” lawsuit with one of Lincoln Central’s property owners. Furthermore, while the\n\ncase Hanna cites to, Cohan, characterizes the showing required of a defendant as a “burden”\n\n(Cohan, 266 Ill. App. 3d at 629), case law illustrates that the task is not a difficult one. Rather\n\nthan proving a negative -- that it is “absolutely clear that [the allegedly unlawful] behavior could\n\nnot reasonably be expected to recur” (Cohan, 266 Ill. App. 3d at 629) -- it is enough for a public\n\ndefendant to show that there is no basis for concluding it will “ ‘return to [its] old tricks once the\n\ncoast is clear.’ ” La Salle National Bank, N.A. v. City of Lake Forest, 297 Ill. App. 3d 36, 45\n\n(1998), quoting Magnuson v. City of Hickory Hills, 933 F.2d 562, 565 (7th Cir. 1991). It has\n\nbeen said that “[w]hen the defendants are public officials, *** greater stock [is placed] in their\n\nacts of self-correction, so long as they appear genuine” (Magnuson, 933 F.2d at 565), and we\n\nread this statement to apply equally to the current municipal defendant. The City has made the\n\nnecessary showing. Nothing in the record suggest this defendant has temporarily ceased\n\noffensive conduct only until “the coast is clear” (see La Salle National Bank, 297 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n45 and the voluntary cessation doctrine does not aid Hanna’s appeal regarding the 2006 rezoning\n\nto RM5.\n\n       Even though the specific controversy between Hanna and the City has been resolved,\n\nHanna next insists “[a]fter seven years of litigation, and [incurring] over $1 million in litigation\n\ncosts, [he] is entitled to a judicial resolution of his claims” and that the matter should not be\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f1-06-3348\n\nconcluded without the entry of declaratory or permanent injunctive relief in his favor. In contrast\n\nto his earlier, concise statements regarding what constituted effective relief in this instance,\n\nHanna now contends he is entitled to a broad, generally worded court order:\n\n               “ ‘Effective relief’ for Hanna is thus a finding, via injunctive\n\n               and/or declaratory relief, that the City cannot excuse one\n\n               unconstitutional act by engaging in another; that the City cannot\n\n               downzone to satisfy the wishes of a few; that the City, without a\n\n               comprehensive plan, cannot simply downzone property on a whim;\n\n               that the City cannot enact zoning policies that deprive its citizens\n\n               of reasonably affordable housing; that the City cannot enact zoning\n\n               practices that decrease tax and other revenues while simultaneously\n\n               increasing per capita taxes and debt; and that the City cannot\n\n               respond to a citizen’s court challenge by backing off its\n\n               unconstitutional policies, inch-by-inch, until it has achieved its\n\n               objective of creating neighborhoods accessible only to the rich,\n\n               white[,] and influential.”\n\nElsewhere in his brief, Hanna states:\n\n               “The declaratory judgment and injunctive relief Hanna seeks will\n\n               ostensibly include specific findings (a) that changing zoning to\n\n               satisfy the wishes of a small community organization does not\n\n               comport with constitutional guarantees of due process, (b) that\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f1-06-3348\n\n               downzoning over and over again without the benefit of a\n\n               comprehensive plan is harmful and wrong, (c) that zoning policies\n\n               that perpetuate racial, social and economic segregation are\n\n               unconstitutional, (d) that zoning without adequate study and\n\n               planning is backwards, (e) that enacting zoning ordinances that\n\n               deprive the City of desperately needed housing and population in\n\n               order to create pockets of wealthy neighborhoods occupied by the\n\n               rich, white and influential is wrong, (f) that the City must consider\n\n               the fiscal impact of its zoning policies before choking off real\n\n               estate, utility and other tax revenues (generated by people and\n\n               housing) it so badly needs, while simultaneously increasing per\n\n               capita taxes and costs of City services, and finally (g) that it is\n\n               improper to back off a litigant’s challenge by replacing one\n\n               unconstitutional rezoning with another until the City can find a\n\n               way to persuade the trial court that the plaintiff’s claims are moot.\n\n               ”\n\nWhat Hanna characterizes as a “finding” or a “specific finding[]” is actually personal\n\ncommentary about the way the City approaches property zoning and lawsuits. Instead of\n\nsharpening the issues, he now claims entitlement to court orders that vaguely encompass not only\n\nhis Lincoln Central real estate, but also municipal zoning policies and practices in general, and\n\neven municipal litigation management. Hanna’s request for declarations and injunctions that are\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f1-06-3348\n\nimprecise and unworkable in practice suggests why litigation usually ends when the issues of a\n\ncase become moot. See Fisch, 365 Ill. App. 3d at 539 (“parties to a resolved dispute lack a\n\nsufficient personal stake in the outcome to assure that there is an adversarial relationship that\n\nsharpens the presentation of issues”). We conclude that the city council, not the judiciary, has\n\nthe authority, expertise, resources, and public input necessary to establish this jurisdiction’s\n\nzoning policies and ordinances.\n\n               “ ‘Courts are ill equipped to determine what the public policy\n\n               should be. Seldom are all interested parties, all facts, and all issues\n\n               present in a single case, where the court can rationally balance all\n\n               the factors necessary to establish a policy good for society.\n\n               Further, establishing public policy may entail the balancing of\n\n               political interests. This is a function of the legislature, not the\n\n               courts.’ ” Board of Education of Dolton School District 14 v.\n\n               Miller, 349 Ill. App. 3d 806, 812 (2004) (holding that trial court’s\n\n               order directing board of education to build sidewalks on public\n\n               rights-of-way for “public health and safety” violated the\n\n               constitutional doctrine of separation of powers), quoting Dixon\n\n               Distributing Co. v. Hanover Insurance Co., 244 Ill. App. 3d 837,\n\n               852 (1993).\n\n“When the legislature has declared, by law, the public policy of the [s]tate, the judicial\n\ndepartment must remain silent, and if a modification or change in such policy is desired the law-\n\n\n                                                  15\n\f1-06-3348\n\nmaking department must be applied to, and not the judiciary, whose function is to declare the law\n\nbut not to make it.” Collins v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 232 Ill. 37, 44 (1908).\n\nPerpetuating this lawsuit so that Hanna may attempt to elevate his personal zoning policy\n\npreferences over Chicago’s citizens and their elected officials is not an appropriate use of the\n\njudicial system.\n\n       Hanna’s next contention is that the court erred when it determined the statements about\n\nHanna’s “ultimate” and “effective” relief amounted to judicial admissions. Hanna asks us to\n\nconclude these were merely arguments his attorney made in a certain context and that they did\n\nnot amount to “concrete facts” within Hanna’s personal knowledge. See, e.g., In re Estate of\n\nRennick, 181 Ill. 2d 395, 406 (1998). He further argues that once the city council “changed the\n\nfacts of this case” by rezoning Lincoln Central to RM5, he was “forced to amend his pleadings\n\nand the relief he sought, “in order to more specifically allege that the City’s zoning practices and\n\npolicies are unconstitutional.”\n\n       We do not need to resolve whether the argumentative statements regarding Hanna’s\n\nultimate and effective relief constituted judicial admissions, as Hanna’s latest pleading (“Eighth\n\nAmended Verified Complaint for Injunctive and Other Relief”) clearly shows he was seeking\n\ndeclaratory judgments and injunctive relief to that effect. The pleading indicates Hanna wanted\n\nthe 1998, 2004, and 2006 municipal zoning amendments applicable to the Lincoln Central\n\nneighborhood declared unconstitutional, and therefore invalid, so that his own Lincoln Central\n\nproperty would be restored to its preamendment designation of R5, or its current equivalent\n\nunder the unchallenged citywide new Chicago Zoning Ordinance, RM5. After considering the\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f1-06-3348\n\nfacts of this case, the pertinent principles, and the parties’ arguments, we find that the circuit\n\ncourt properly dismissed Hanna’s action as moot because there was no longer an actual case or\n\ncontroversy between the parties once the city council amended the municipal zoning ordinance to\n\nreflect the RM5 designation for the Lincoln Central neighborhood. Once the pleading and facts\n\nof this case showed that Hanna had secured the substantive relief he sought, which was to negate\n\nthe effects of the three rezonings applicable to his residential neighborhood, the trial court\n\nproperly declined to resolve the constitutional issues simply to establish precedent or to offer\n\nguidance for future actions.\n\n       Hanna further argues that even if the mootness doctrine is applied, we should invoke the\n\npublic interest exception in order to resolve his constitutional arguments. Three criteria will\n\ndetermine whether the public interest exception is appropriate: (1) the question is of a public\n\nnature, (2) an authoritative resolution is desirable for the purpose of guiding public officers in the\n\nperformance of their duties, and (3) the question is likely to recur. Sharma v. Zollar, 265 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 1022, 1028 (1994). A clear showing of each factor is necessary to bring a case within\n\nthis exception, and the exception is invoked only on rare occasions (ChiCorp, 336 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n139) involving “an extraordinary degree of public concern.” Sharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1028.\n\n       An analogous case is Sharma, in which a physician’s action regarding the denial of his\n\nrequest to subpoena individuals during a disciplinary proceeding was rendered moot by the\n\ndismissal of the underlying charges against him. Sharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1023. The\n\nphysician’s need for the requested subpoenas had been eliminated and his right to them became\n\n“theoretical and, thus, moot.” Sharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1028. In the appellate court, the\n\n\n                                                  17\n\f1-06-3348\n\nphysician contended that while the status of his medical license was no longer in doubt, a\n\ncontroversy continued to exist regarding his due process rights to the requested subpoenas.\n\nSharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1026-27. However, the court refused to reach the constitutional\n\nrights issue, emphasizing that when it becomes “apparent that an opinion cannot affect the results\n\nas to the parties or controversy before it, the court should not resolve the question merely for the\n\nsake of setting a precedent or to govern potential future cases.” Sharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n1027. See also Sadler, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 1040 (“a court should not resolve a question just to set\n\nprecedent or to provide guidance for future actions”). The case failed the third criterion for\n\nemploying the public interest exception because the physician’s right to the issuance of\n\nsubpoenas would not recur once the charges against him had been dismissed. Sharma, 265 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 1029. Furthermore, while the general question of an applicant or licensee’s right to\n\nthe issuance of subpoenas might exist as to future litigants, the court held that that issue could be\n\nproperly reviewed “at a later date, in the context of an actual controversy, when charges are\n\npending and when effectual relief can be granted.” Sharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1029. The court\n\ncontrasted the situation with Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 125, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 161, 93 S. Ct.\n\n705, 713 (1973), where the question of abortion rights was addressed because the short gestation\n\nperiod of a human fetus meant the issue was capable of repetition to the plaintiff as well as the\n\ngeneral public, yet evading review. Sharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1029. Other cases found to\n\nsatisfy the three factors and involve the requisite “extraordinary degree of public concern and\n\ninterest” (La Salle National Bank v. City of Chicago, 3 Ill. 2d 375, 380 (1954)) concerned “life\n\nand death issues raised in the context of governmental action impending on religious beliefs,”\n\n\n                                                 18\n\f1-06-3348\n\npublic health concerns, or the need to develop case law to guide public officials regarding issues\n\nsuch as involuntary commitments or the use of Department of Corrections facilities to house\n\njuveniles. Sharma, 265 Ill App. 3d at 1029.\n\n        We also find guidance in the zoning case discussed above concerning the Baybrook\n\napartment construction project. There, the court declined to invoke the public interest exception\n\nto the mootness doctrine because (1) “any recurrence of the question of the validity of the [flood\n\nplain] ordinance would involve its application to [real] property other than Baybrook, with\n\ndifferent physical characteristics and different proposed uses” and (2) a determination of the\n\nfacial validity of the ordinance would have only limited utility in guiding the actions of public\n\nofficials. Village of Palatine, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 891-92.\n\n        Based on these authorities, we find the public interest exception is not appropriately\n\napplied to Hanna’s zoning action because the issues presented are not likely to recur to him on a\n\nrepeated basis. If it is true, as he argues, it is “a virtual certainty” the City will subsequently\n\n“engage[] in the type of arbitrary and irrational zoning policies and procedures challenged in\n\nHanna’s Complaint,” then the City’s conduct can be reviewed in the context of an actual\n\ncontroversy, when the plaintiff has a stake in the outcome and effectual relief can be granted.\n\nSharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1029.\n\n        Hanna mistakenly contends “a similar scenario” justified invocation of the public interest\n\nexception in Johnson v. Edgar, 176 Ill. 2d 499 (1997). That case is dissimilar, in part because it\n\ninvolved legislation which two circuit court judges had separately determined was enacted in\n\nviolation of the constitutional prohibition on bills that encompass more than one subject.\n\n\n                                                   19\n\f1-06-3348\n\nJohnson, 176 Ill. 2d at 502. After the judges permanently enjoined enforcement of the public act,\n\nthe two cases were consolidated on appeal to the supreme court. Johnson, 176 Ill. 2d at 502.\n\nDuring the appeal, the legislation was partially amended, which ordinarily would have mooted\n\nthe appeal. Johnson, 176 Ill. 2d at 512. The parties agreed, however, that the criteria for the\n\npublic interest exception were satisfied. Johnson, 176 Ill. 2d at 513. Furthermore, the issue had\n\nbeen raised in at least one other case that was already pending in the trial court and the portion of\n\nthe legislation which was not amended was still open to challenge on the same basis. Johnson,\n\n176 Ill. 2d at 513. “Consequently, resolution of the [constitutional] challenge by [the supreme]\n\ncourt [would] be of assistance to both the lower courts and the public officers who [were] faced\n\nwith questions regarding the validity of the Act’s many provisions.” Johnson, 176 Ill. 2d at 513.\n\nIn contrast, the present action was not tried on the merits and was rendered moot during the\n\npleading stage when the plaintiff received the precise relief he was seeking. In addition, only the\n\nplaintiff, who has turned to the state and federal courts numerous times, contends the issues are\n\nstill worth litigating. Also, there is no indication in the record on appeal that the three rezonings\n\nof the plaintiff’s neighborhood are the basis of some other plaintiff’s complaint and should be\n\naddressed on an urgent basis to assist the trial court or public officials dealing with life-or-death\n\nissues, public health concerns, or other time-sensitive matters.\n\n       Moreover, Hanna’s reliance on Berrios v. Rybacki, 190 Ill. App. 3d 338 (1989), Morrison\n\nv. Chicago Board of Education, 188 Ill. App. 3d 588 (1989), and People ex rel. Wallace v.\n\nLabrenz, 411 Ill. 618 (1952), all nonzoning cases, is similarly misplaced. As the trial judge aptly\n\nremarked, these cases involved questions of significant importance affecting the rights of a great\n\n\n                                                  20\n\f1-06-3348\n\nnumber of citizens and questions that were highly likely to recur. Berrios presented a question of\n\ninterest to every employee and employer litigating workers’ compensation claims in Illinois:\n\nwhether certain directives issued by the Illinois Industrial Commission were void because they\n\nviolated the Illinois Administrative Procedures Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 127, par. 1001 et\n\nseq.) Berrios, 190 Ill. App. 3d at 344. Morrison “easily [came within] the public interest\n\nexception,” because it concerned the minimum age for admission to public school in Illinois and\n\nthus affected potential kindergartners, as well as their families, and the school teachers and\n\nadministrators. Morrison, 188 Ill. App. 3d at 590-92. The issue in Labrenz was whether parents\n\ncould refuse on religious grounds blood transfusions for their critically ill infant and therefore\n\nimplicated not only the balance between governmental action and the religious beliefs of\n\nindividual citizens, but also presented a life-or-death issue which was likely to recur and become\n\nmoot by ordinary standards before it could be addressed by the courts. Labrenz, 411 Ill. at 623.\n\nHanna cannot show that the zoning classification of his neighborhood has comparably broad\n\nimpact on the public at large and urgently requires authoritative resolution.\n\n       Finally, Hanna contends “the City rezoned to RM5 to get Hanna out of court” and he\n\ncites Amoco Oil Co. v. Village of Schaumburg, 277 Ill. App. 3d 926 (1995) for the proposition\n\nthat it is unconstitutional as a matter of law to enact an ordinance in order to resolve a lawsuit.\n\nHanna’s argument begs the question as to how conscientious public officials could permissibly\n\nresolve litigation that requires legislative action. Nevertheless, he argues that it was a “critical\n\nfact” in Amoco Oil that the municipality’s reason for legislating was to “get the case out of\n\nfederal court.” He urges this court to determine the City cannot legislate in order to end\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f1-06-3348\n\nlitigation, and, thus, give him effective relief and provide future guidance to public officials\n\nregarding the constitutional bounds of their powers.\n\n       The City does not concede that its sole motivation for the 2006 rezoning was to end this\n\nlawsuit and contends that the alderman’s December 2005 letter to neighborhood residents\n\nregarding the rezoning provides insight into the author’s perspective, but does not indicate the\n\nentire the city council shares her views. Assuming for the purposes of argument that the letter\n\nreveals the motivation for the 2006 rezoning, the City contends Amoco Oil is both factually and\n\nlegally distinguishable. Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d 926.\n\n       We find the City’s arguments persuasive. The alderman’s letter does not suggest she is\n\ncomprehensively stating her reasons for proposing the 2006 rezoning, nor does she purport to\n\nspeak for the entire the city council. Moreover, Hanna is misstating Amoco Oil’s holding\n\n(Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d 926), and the case is too different from the present matter to be\n\ncontrolling. The municipality in Amoco Oil first adopted an ordinance indicating it was taking\n\n20% of the landowner’s property without compensation, as a condition for granting a special use\n\npermit allowing the landowner to redevelop the lot. Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 930. The\n\nlandowner, however, objected to the conditional granting and filed suit in federal court. Amoco\n\nOil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 930. The federal judge denied the landowner’s motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction, on the grounds that the landowner had a sufficient remedy at law for money damages,\n\nbut nonetheless conveyed its inclinations about the merits of the lawsuit:\n\n               “[I]f the public officials know that their actions are not supported\n\n               by the law and persist anyway, driven by some impression that they\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f1-06-3348\n\n               can attach these conditions because zoning ordinances constitute\n\n               some kind of public favor to be dispensed, that is certainly against\n\n               public policy.” Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 930.\n\nShortly thereafter, the municipality adopted an ordinance repealing the first ordinance, and the\n\nfederal court dismissed the action. Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 930-31. In other words, the\n\nmunicipality passed the repealing ordinance in an effort to deny the property owner any relief -- if\n\nthe municipality had its way, the landowner would have neither the special use permit necessary\n\nto redevelop its property nor any legal recourse. The landowner filed suit in state court,\n\nchallenging both the conditional granting and subsequent revocation of the special use permit.\n\nAmoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 927. The evidence presented at trial led the state appellate court\n\nto conclude the municipality’s attempted exaction of 20% of the property without just\n\ncompensation was an unconstitutional taking. Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 944. The court\n\nalso agreed “that the repealer ordinance was merely a transparent litigation tactic used to divest\n\nthe Federal court of continuing jurisdiction” (Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 934) and that it was\n\nnot a reasonable exercise of legislative authority to “repeal a zoning ordinance solely on the\n\ngrounds that the putative holder of a special use permit failed to comply with an unconstitutional\n\nexaction of property” (Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 945). Thus, Amoco Oil does not stand for\n\nthe proposition that it is per se unconstitutional to legislate in order to resolve a lawsuit. Hanna\n\nhas not only misstated the court’s holding, but also cited authority with no factual resemblance to\n\nhis own dispute with the City. Here, the City of Chicago did not attempt to take a portion of\n\nHanna’s Mohawk Street property without just compensation, deny him the ability to redevelop\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f1-06-3348\n\nthe real estate, and deprive him to any legal recourse. Instead, the city council has given Hanna\n\nas much as possible under the current municipal zoning ordinance, conveyed what Hanna (or\n\nHanna’s attorney) deemed his effective and ultimate relief, and mooted the need for any further\n\nlitigation about the zoning classification applicable to his Mohawk Street land. Thus, the more\n\npertinent cases are ones such as Village of Skokie v. Gianoulis, 260 Ill. App. 3d 287, 298 (1994),\n\nThompson v. Cook County Zoning Board of Appeals, 96 Ill. App. 3d 561, 572 (1981), 2700\n\nIrving Park Building Corp. v. City of Chicago, 395 Ill. 138, 147 (1946), and Grand Trunk\n\nWestern Ry. Co. v. Industrial Comm’n, 291 Ill. 167, 172 (1919), all of which indicate the courts\n\ncannot inquire into the factors which motivated a legislative body to act; courts may only\n\nconsider whether legislation has a reasonable relation to public health, comfort, safety and\n\nwelfare, or is unreasonable, arbitrary, or fraudulent. Hanna’s contention that the most recent\n\nrezoning was enacted to end lengthy, costly litigation does not implicate any of these concerns.\n\n       For these reasons, we find the circuit court properly rejected Hanna’s invocation of the\n\npublic interest exception to the mootness doctrine.\n\n       Having rejected all of the appellant’s contentions, we affirm the dismissal of his action.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n       GORDON and O’MALLEY, concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\f",

On remand, Hanna twice stated in written\n\nopposition to motions filed by the City that the “ultimate” and “effective” relief he was seeking\n\nwas reversion to the R5 category, or its current equivalent, RM5. In 2006, the city council\n\nrezoned Hanna’s neighborhood to RM5 and the circuit court dismissed his action as moot.\n\nHanna argues his action is not moot or should be addressed under the public interest exception to\n\nthe mootness doctrine.\n\n       The following facts come from our prior opinion and the record currently on appeal. The\n\f1-06-3348\n\nLincoln Central neighborhood is north of downtown Chicago in the 43rd aldermanic ward, and is\n\ngenerally bounded on the west by Halstead Street, on the northeast by Lincoln Avenue, on the\n\nsoutheast by the former Ogden Avenue, and on the south by North Avenue. There are at least\n\n3,500 dwelling units within its boundaries. Hanna’s property consists of four lots located at\n\n1742-50 North Mohawk Street. He purchased the lots in 1971 and erected a five-story brick\n\napartment building containing 26 units. At the time, the neighborhood was zoned R5, with no\n\nbuilding height restrictions, and the minimum lot area (MLA) per dwelling was 400 square feet\n\nwith a maximum floor area ratio (FAR) of 2.2 (allowing construction of buildings roughly 2.2\n\ntimes the size of the lot).\n\n        The zoning remained R5 until 1998, when the city council amended the municipal zoning\n\nordinance with an “overlay district” applicable to Lincoln Central called the “Lincoln Central\n\nSpecial District” or SD-19, which enhanced the restrictions on new construction in the\n\nneighborhood. Under SD-19, the building height was limited to 43 feet, the MLA was increased\n\nto 1,000 feet, and the FAR was reduced to 1.7. In practical terms, the rezoning reduced the size\n\nand bulk of new buildings and decreased the density of new dwelling units. According to Hanna,\n\nthe 1998 rezoning was done at the urging of various property owners who formed a\n\nneighborhood association known as the Lincoln Central Association.1 On June 4, 1999, Hanna\n\n\n        1\n            Hanna does not reside in the 26-unit apartment building, but instead makes his home\n\nless than two miles north in a three-story single-family residence at 541 West Deming Place.\n\nHanna brought a separate action against the City when the Deming Place property was rezoned in\n\n1997 from R5 to R4. Hanna prevailed in the Deming Place rezoning action; however, his\n\n                                                 2\n\f1-06-3348\n\nbegan the current lawsuit, alleging that the rezoning to SD-19 violated his rights under the\n\nIllinois Constitution. Hanna indicated he did not intend to redevelop his property, but the\n\nrezoning rendered his Mohawk Street apartment building a nonconforming structure and\n\ndeprived him of the highest and best possible use of his property. Hanna’s lawsuit had been\n\npending for five years when the City did away with SD-19, first by adopting on May 27, 2004, a\n\nnew Chicago Zoning Ordinance which abolished all “R” zoning categories in Chicago in favor of\n\nnew categories (Chicago Municipal Code §17-1-1406-A (eff. August 1, 2004)), and later that\n\nyear, on November 3, 2004, by recategorizing the neighborhood as RM4.5. Hanna, however,\n\namended his complaint, for the seventh time, in order to add claims against the 2004 rezoning to\n\nRM4.5. As we stated earlier, when the City filed motions for partial summary judgment and\n\ndismissal of Hanna’s seventh amended complaint, he responded that the “effective” and\n\n“ultimate” relief he had been seeking was reversion to R5 or its current equivalent RM5. More\n\n\npetition for approximately $1 million in attorney fees and $160,000 in costs was denied, and we\n\nrejected his appeal. Hanna v. City of Chicago, No. 1-01-3093 (2005) (unpublished order under\n\nSupreme Court Rule 23), appeal denied, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2021554\"><a href=\"/opinion/2021554/gallina-v-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005). Hanna also unsuccessful sued to\n\nrecover those fees and costs in federal court. Hanna v. City of Chicago, No. 03-C-2321 (N.D.\n\nIll., August 27, 2003). He also turned to the courts in 1987 when he sued his Deming Place\n\nneighbor to enforce the subdivision’s 50-foot building setback line created in 1860.

Hanna owns a 24-unit apartment building at 1216-1220 North Dearborn\n\nAvenue which is not affected by the zoning for Lincoln Central or Deming environs.\n\n                                                 3\n\f1-06-3348\n\nspecifically, in a response brief filed January 28, 2005, to the City’s motion for partial summary\n\njudgment, Hanna stated:\n\n               “[I]f the Court finds both [RM4.5] and SD19 invalid, the zoning\n\n               will revert back to its pre-SD19 zoning of R5 (or its current\n\n               equivalent of RM5), by operation of law.\n\n                       This is the ultimate relief Hanna has been seeking all along,\n\n               and is thus ‘effective’ for him.” (Emphasis in original.)\n\nHanna repeated these statements in the response brief he filed May 27, 2005, to the City’s motion\n\nto dismiss and strike certain counts in Hanna’s then-current pleading.\n\n       In late 2005, the alderman of the 43rd Ward sought to change the neighborhood’s zoning\n\nfrom RM4.5 to RM5, which would increase the maximum building height to 45 feet and the\n\nFAR to 2.0. After notification letters had been sent out by the City and a community meeting\n\nwas convened and attended by approximately 80 residents, the alderman sent property owners a\n\nsecond notification, which included more detail and a request for further community input\n\nregarding the rezoning. The alderman indicated the Lincoln Central neighborhood association\n\n“worked very hard” to help establish the SD-19 zoning and that the City was spending\n\nconsiderable public resources defending the classification in litigation with an unnamed plaintiff.\n\nSix years of litigation had been “protracted and expensive” and a trial would add to those costs\n\nand possibly result in “an unwelcome decision if the plaintiff were to prevail.” The City’s\n\nDepartment of Planning and Development and Department of Law were recommending that the\n\nlitigation be resolved expeditiously by rezoning to RM5, and the alderman had begrudgingly\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f1-06-3348\n\nagreed, even though “[m]any people in the neighborhood would like to see more restrictive not\n\nless restrictive zoning regulations.” According to notes from the December 13, 2005, meeting of\n\nthe zoning committee of the Lincoln Central Association, the neighborhood organization\n\nsupported the proposed rezoning, with the caveat that if “the lawsuit continue[d] in spite of this\n\nupzoning, [the group] would request that zoning be returned to RM4.5.\" On January 11, 2006,\n\nthe city council passed the RM5 zoning amendment, which became effective on February 8,\n\n2006.\n\n        Hanna, nevertheless, filed an eighth amended complaint, adding claims against the 2006\n\nrezoning and restating his claims against the 1998 and 2004 changes. In 3 of the 11 counts, he\n\nsought judicial declarations that one or all of the rezonings violated his constitutional rights to\n\nsubstantive and procedural due process and equal protection under the law and constituted\n\nimpermissible spot zoning, and in the remaining eight counts, he sought to permanently enjoin\n\nenforcement of the rezonings. The City responded with a motion to dismiss the action, arguing\n\nHanna’s claims had been mooted by the latest rezoning and that the courts were unable to grant\n\nhim any further relief. The City cited Hanna’s statements regarding his “ultimate” and\n\n“effective” relief, characterized these statements as judicial admissions, and argued that Hanna\n\nhad obtained what he had been seeking. The City further argued that in any event, the court\n\ncould not grant Hanna any additional relief because the original R5 zoning category had been\n\nabolished by the City’s adoption of the new Chicago Zoning Ordinance, which Hanna was not\n\nchallenging, 2 and no existing zoning category would grant rights equivalent to the old R5\n\n\n        2\n            Hanna did attempt to challenge the constitutionality of the new Chicago Zoning\n\n                                                  5\n\f1-06-3348\n\nclassification. In response, Hanna conceded, “The City has, technically, ‘mooted’ Hanna’s\n\npersonal claim for a rezoning to R-5, or RM-5,\" but he contended his statements identifying RM5\n\nas his “ultimate relief” were mere legal conclusions instead of judicial admissions, and that his\n\naction was not moot because the City had not met its burden of “an absolute clear showing that\n\nthe wrongful conduct alleged [could] not be expected to recur.” Hanna also contended the 2006\n\nrezoning amounted to “legislative sl[e]ight of hand” aimed solely at ending his lawsuit, which he\n\nargued was an improper, unconstitutional motivation. In the alternative, Hanna argued his action\n\nshould be addressed under the public interest exception to mootness, in order to give future\n\nguidance to City officials regarding the constitutionality of the municipality’s zoning policies and\n\npractices. The circuit court granted the City’s motion to dismiss on October 17, 2006, ruling that\n\nthe statements regarding Hanna’s relief were binding judicial admissions, that the 2006 rezoning\n\neffectively granted Hanna all his requested relief and was not done for an improper purpose, that\n\nthe 2006 rezoning mooted the action because the City was not asserting the constitutionality of\n\nthe 1998 and 2004 rezoning or its right to enforce those rezonings in the future, and that the\n\naction did not warrant application of the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine.\n\n       The granting of a motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2-619(a)(9) of the Code of Civil\n\n\nOrdinance, which in relevant part rezoned all R5 property to RM5. That separate action, Hanna\n\nv. City of Chicago, No. 06-CH-23366, was dismissed by Judge Kathleen M. Pantle on June 12,\n\n2007, due to Hanna’s admitted failure to comply with the notice provision in section 11-13-8 of\n\nthe Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-13-8 (West 2006)). Hanna is currently appealing the\n\ndismissal (No. 1-07-1960) and recently filed his opening appellate brief.\n\n                                                 6\n\f1-06-3348\n\nProcedure is reviewed de novo.

A\n\nmooted action should be dismissed out of “concern that parties to a resolved dispute lack a\n\nsufficient personal stake in the outcome to assure that there is an adversarial relationship that\n\nsharpens the presentation of issues upon which the courts largely depend for illumination of\n\ndifficult questions.” Fisch v.

ChiCorp, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 135. The\n\nDepartment prevailed on a section 2-619(a)(9) motion to dismiss the action on the basis of\n\nmootness, in which it stated it would return the money paid, plus interest, and would not attempt\n\nto recover those funds in the future from the plaintiff. ChiCorp, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 135-36; 735\n\nILCS 5/2-619(a)(9) (West 2000).

ChiCorp, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 136. The appellate court rejected this\n\ncontention because the pleadings and facts of the case showed that the parties were in agreement\n\nabout the disposition of the money, which meant “there was no longer an actual case or\n\ncontroversy existing between the parties.” ChiCorp, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 137. A decision\n\nregarding the additional issues, when there was no longer a controversy before the court, would\n\nhave resulted in an improper, advisory opinion. ChiCorp, 336 Ill.

The appellate\n\npanel affirmed the entry of summary judgment for City, reasoning that any controversy over the\n\nCity’s production of documents “clearly ceased to exist once the City tendered those documents\n\nto [the publisher].” Duncan Publishing, 304 Ill.

He points to the fact\n\nthat the Lincoln Central neighborhood group supported the 2006 rezoning to RM5 and contends\n\nthe group has “threatened to rezone his Property again if the rezoning *** does not end [this\n\nlitigation].” He also emphasizes that his real estate has been rezoned three times in the last\n\ndecade and cites a statement Paul Woznicki made when he was deposed in connection with this\n\nsuit on July 29, 2004, “[W]hen I was the zoning administrator, they were up 400 [sic] -- 450\n\namendments made just to the maps, and I heard that that’s mushroomed to six or seven hundred\n\nor eight hundred annually.” Hanna concludes the City failed to meet its burden and that the\n\nmotion to dismiss his 11-count complaint should have been denied on this point alone. We do\n\nnot find Hanna’s argument persuasive because the facts and relevant case law are not in his\n\nfavor.\n\n         Hanna’s allegations regarding the 1998 and 2004 rezonings are indisputably moot\n\nbecause those zoning ordinances no longer exist and the City has expressed no intention to\n\nenforce them. Pertinent here is Village of Palatine v. LaSalle National Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2174100\"><a href=\"/opinion/2174100/village-of-palatine-v-lasalle-natl-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

The trial judge\n\ndeclared both ordinances invalid as applied to the Baybrook project and enjoined the\n\nmunicipality from enforcing them. Village of Palatine, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 890. The municipality\n\nappealed, but also amended its flood plain ordinance by adopting the most recent Illinois\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f1-06-3348\n\nDepartment of Transportation Flood Plain maps. Village of Palatine, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 890.\n\nUnder those maps, the Baybrook construction project was no longer in a designated flood plain.\n\nVillage of Palatine, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 890. The change ended the appeal as to the flood plain\n\nordinance, because “courts will not determine the question of the validity of an ordinance which\n\nis no longer in force and which can not be applied to the complaining parties.” Village of\n\nPalatine, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 891. The only issue to be decided was the validity of the\n\nunamended building height ordinance. Village of Palatine, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 892. Given that\n\nthe 1998 and 2004 zoning ordinances no longer exist, we should not determine their validity.\n\nFurthermore, Hanna is relying on cases which are readily distinguishable. In the first case, the\n\ndefendant banks agreed to waive the service fee at issue, but “maintain[ed] the right to assess the\n\nvery same charge” in the future.” Cohan, 266 Ill. App. 3d at 630. In the second case, the\n\ndefendant trust company agreed to let state examiners review certain account records, but\n\n“continue[d] to insist upon the right to withhold such accounts” and “inescapably le[ft] open the\n\npossibility that [it might] refuse a similar examination in the future.” Fryzel, 173 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n794. In contrast, the current defendant is not asserting the constitutionality of the 1998 or 2004\n\nrezoning to Hanna’s property, nor its right to enforce those rezonings in the future. The present\n\nappeal is also analogous to the one described in Fisch, in which the plaintiffs sought an\n\ninjunction requiring a national chain of movie theaters to publish the approximate length or the\n\nspecific start time of commercial advertisements, movie previews, and feature films, so that\n\nconsumers would not unwittingly arrive early and become a captive audience to advertisers.\n\nFisch, 365 Ill. App. 3d at 537-38. The circuit court dismissed the action as one based on a de\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f1-06-3348\n\nminimis injury (Fisch, 365 Ill. App. 3d at 538), and the appellate court never reached the\n\narguments regarding this ruling, because during the appellate process, any actual controversy\n\nended when the national chain began publishing its movie listings with the statement that “ ‘the\n\nfeature presentation will start 10 or 15 minutes after the published showtime.’ ” Fisch, 365 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 539. Once the plaintiffs had secured what they sought -- reasonable notice of the true\n\nstarting times of movies shown at the defendants’ theaters -- the controversy ended. Fisch, 365\n\nIll. App. 3d at 540. Like Hanna, the plaintiffs argued their action was not moot, because without\n\nan injunction the national chain was free to reverse its policy at any point in time. Fisch, 365 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 540. Nevertheless, the court did not find this argument persuasive because the\n\nnational chain “ha[d] not asserted, insisted upon, or maintained the right to omit reasonable\n\nnotice of the actual starting times from their movie listings in the future,” and had instead\n\npublicly announced its new policy and notified an Illinois legislator of the policy’s\n\nimplementation. Fisch, 365 Ill. App. 3d at 540. Considering the facts in light of this precedent,\n\nwe conclude the voluntary cessation doctrine does not aid Hanna’s appeal regarding the 1998 and\n\n2004 rezonings.\n\n       With respect to the 2006 rezoning, Hanna is relying primarily on the meeting minutes of\n\nthe Lincoln Central neighborhood association which indicate that if rezoning to RM5 did not end\n\nthis lawsuit, the group would ask for their neighborhood be returned to the RM4.5 designation.\n\nThe meeting minutes do not help Hanna because the group will not act on its intention if we\n\naffirm the trial court’s mootness finding. More importantly, the community association does not\n\nhave the power to rezone the neighborhood and it does not speak for the City. The fact that the\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f1-06-3348\n\ncity council has rezoned Lincoln Central and other neighborhoods in the recent past does not\n\nsuggest the city council intends to rezone Lincoln Central in the future, particularly when the\n\ncurrent rezoning has resulted in the dismissal of what the local alderman deemed a “protracted\n\nand expensive” lawsuit with one of Lincoln Central’s property owners. Furthermore, while the\n\ncase Hanna cites to, Cohan, characterizes the showing required of a defendant as a “burden”\n\n(Cohan, 266 Ill. App. 3d at 629), case law illustrates that the task is not a difficult one. Rather\n\nthan proving a negative -- that it is “absolutely clear that [the allegedly unlawful] behavior could\n\nnot reasonably be expected to recur” (Cohan, 266 Ill. App. 3d at 629) -- it is enough for a public\n\ndefendant to show that there is no basis for concluding it will “ ‘return to [its] old tricks once the\n\ncoast is clear.’ ” La Salle National Bank, N.A. v.

It has\n\nbeen said that “[w]hen the defendants are public officials, *** greater stock [is placed] in their\n\nacts of self-correction, so long as they appear genuine” (Magnuson, 933 F.2d at 565), and we\n\nread this statement to apply equally to the current municipal defendant. The City has made the\n\nnecessary showing. Nothing in the record suggest this defendant has temporarily ceased\n\noffensive conduct only until “the coast is clear” (see La Salle National Bank, 297 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n45 and the voluntary cessation doctrine does not aid Hanna’s appeal regarding the 2006 rezoning\n\nto RM5.\n\n       Even though the specific controversy between Hanna and the City has been resolved,\n\nHanna next insists “[a]fter seven years of litigation, and [incurring] over $1 million in litigation\n\ncosts, [he] is entitled to a judicial resolution of his claims” and that the matter should not be\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f1-06-3348\n\nconcluded without the entry of declaratory or permanent injunctive relief in his favor. In contrast\n\nto his earlier, concise statements regarding what constituted effective relief in this instance,\n\nHanna now contends he is entitled to a broad, generally worded court order:\n\n               “ ‘Effective relief’ for Hanna is thus a finding, via injunctive\n\n               and/or declaratory relief, that the City cannot excuse one\n\n               unconstitutional act by engaging in another; that the City cannot\n\n               downzone to satisfy the wishes of a few; that the City, without a\n\n               comprehensive plan, cannot simply downzone property on a whim;\n\n               that the City cannot enact zoning policies that deprive its citizens\n\n               of reasonably affordable housing; that the City cannot enact zoning\n\n               practices that decrease tax and other revenues while simultaneously\n\n               increasing per capita taxes and debt; and that the City cannot\n\n               respond to a citizen’s court challenge by backing off its\n\n               unconstitutional policies, inch-by-inch, until it has achieved its\n\n               objective of creating neighborhoods accessible only to the rich,\n\n               white[,] and influential.”\n\nElsewhere in his brief, Hanna states:\n\n               “The declaratory judgment and injunctive relief Hanna seeks will\n\n               ostensibly include specific findings (a) that changing zoning to\n\n               satisfy the wishes of a small community organization does not\n\n               comport with constitutional guarantees of due process, (b) that\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f1-06-3348\n\n               downzoning over and over again without the benefit of a\n\n               comprehensive plan is harmful and wrong, (c) that zoning policies\n\n               that perpetuate racial, social and economic segregation are\n\n               unconstitutional, (d) that zoning without adequate study and\n\n               planning is backwards, (e) that enacting zoning ordinances that\n\n               deprive the City of desperately needed housing and population in\n\n               order to create pockets of wealthy neighborhoods occupied by the\n\n               rich, white and influential is wrong, (f) that the City must consider\n\n               the fiscal impact of its zoning policies before choking off real\n\n               estate, utility and other tax revenues (generated by people and\n\n               housing) it so badly needs, while simultaneously increasing per\n\n               capita taxes and costs of City services, and finally (g) that it is\n\n               improper to back off a litigant’s challenge by replacing one\n\n               unconstitutional rezoning with another until the City can find a\n\n               way to persuade the trial court that the plaintiff’s claims are moot.\n\n               ”\n\nWhat Hanna characterizes as a “finding” or a “specific finding[]” is actually personal\n\ncommentary about the way the City approaches property zoning and lawsuits. Instead of\n\nsharpening the issues, he now claims entitlement to court orders that vaguely encompass not only\n\nhis Lincoln Central real estate, but also municipal zoning policies and practices in general, and\n\neven municipal litigation management. Hanna’s request for declarations and injunctions that are\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f1-06-3348\n\nimprecise and unworkable in practice suggests why litigation usually ends when the issues of a\n\ncase become moot. See Fisch, 365 Ill. App. 3d at 539 (“parties to a resolved dispute lack a\n\nsufficient personal stake in the outcome to assure that there is an adversarial relationship that\n\nsharpens the presentation of issues”). We conclude that the city council, not the judiciary, has\n\nthe authority, expertise, resources, and public input necessary to establish this jurisdiction’s\n\nzoning policies and ordinances.\n\n               “ ‘Courts are ill equipped to determine what the public policy\n\n               should be.

Hanna asks us to\n\nconclude these were merely arguments his attorney made in a certain context and that they did\n\nnot amount to “concrete facts” within Hanna’s personal knowledge. See, e.g., In re Estate of\n\nRennick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2085276\"><a href=\"/opinion/2085276/in-re-estate-of-rennick/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406 (1998). He further argues that once the city council “changed the\n\nfacts of this case” by rezoning Lincoln Central to RM5, he was “forced to amend his pleadings\n\nand the relief he sought, “in order to more specifically allege that the City’s zoning practices and\n\npolicies are unconstitutional.”\n\n       We do not need to resolve whether the argumentative statements regarding Hanna’s\n\nultimate and effective relief constituted judicial admissions, as Hanna’s latest pleading (“Eighth\n\nAmended Verified Complaint for Injunctive and Other Relief”) clearly shows he was seeking\n\ndeclaratory judgments and injunctive relief to that effect. The pleading indicates Hanna wanted\n\nthe 1998, 2004, and 2006 municipal zoning amendments applicable to the Lincoln Central\n\nneighborhood declared unconstitutional, and therefore invalid, so that his own Lincoln Central\n\nproperty would be restored to its preamendment designation of R5, or its current equivalent\n\nunder the unchallenged citywide new Chicago Zoning Ordinance, RM5. After considering the\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f1-06-3348\n\nfacts of this case, the pertinent principles, and the parties’ arguments, we find that the circuit\n\ncourt properly dismissed Hanna’s action as moot because there was no longer an actual case or\n\ncontroversy between the parties once the city council amended the municipal zoning ordinance to\n\nreflect the RM5 designation for the Lincoln Central neighborhood. Once the pleading and facts\n\nof this case showed that Hanna had secured the substantive relief he sought, which was to negate\n\nthe effects of the three rezonings applicable to his residential neighborhood, the trial court\n\nproperly declined to resolve the constitutional issues simply to establish precedent or to offer\n\nguidance for future actions.\n\n       Hanna further argues that even if the mootness doctrine is applied, we should invoke the\n\npublic interest exception in order to resolve his constitutional arguments. Three criteria will\n\ndetermine whether the public interest exception is appropriate: (1) the question is of a public\n\nnature, (2) an authoritative resolution is desirable for the purpose of guiding public officers in the\n\nperformance of their duties, and (3) the question is likely to recur. Sharma v. Zollar, 265 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 1022, 1028 (1994). A clear showing of each factor is necessary to bring a case within\n\nthis exception, and the exception is invoked only on rare occasions (ChiCorp, 336 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n139) involving “an extraordinary degree of public concern.” Sharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1028.\n\n       An analogous case is Sharma, in which a physician’s action regarding the denial of his\n\nrequest to subpoena individuals during a disciplinary proceeding was rendered moot by the\n\ndismissal of the underlying charges against him. Sharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1023. The\n\nphysician’s need for the requested subpoenas had been eliminated and his right to them became\n\n“theoretical and, thus, moot.” Sharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1028. In the appellate court, the\n\n\n                                                  17\n\f1-06-3348\n\nphysician contended that while the status of his medical license was no longer in doubt, a\n\ncontroversy continued to exist regarding his due process rights to the requested subpoenas.\n\nSharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1026-27. However, the court refused to reach the constitutional\n\nrights issue, emphasizing that when it becomes “apparent that an opinion cannot affect the results\n\nas to the parties or controversy before it, the court should not resolve the question merely for the\n\nsake of setting a precedent or to govern potential future cases.” Sharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n1027. See also Sadler, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 1040 (“a court should not resolve a question just to set\n\nprecedent or to provide guidance for future actions”). The case failed the third criterion for\n\nemploying the public interest exception because the physician’s right to the issuance of\n\nsubpoenas would not recur once the charges against him had been dismissed. Sharma, 265 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 1029. Furthermore, while the general question of an applicant or licensee’s right to\n\nthe issuance of subpoenas might exist as to future litigants, the court held that that issue could be\n\nproperly reviewed “at a later date, in the context of an actual controversy, when charges are\n\npending and when effectual relief can be granted.” Sharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1029. The court\n\ncontrasted the situation with Roe v. Wade, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108713\"><a href=\"/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 125, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108713\"><a href=\"/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Sharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1029. Other cases found to\n\nsatisfy the three factors and involve the requisite “extraordinary degree of public concern and\n\ninterest” (La Salle National Bank v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2195466\"><a href=\"/opinion/2195466/la-salle-nat-bank-v-city-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 380 (1954)) concerned “life\n\nand death issues raised in the context of governmental action impending on religious beliefs,”\n\n\n                                                 18\n\f1-06-3348\n\npublic health concerns, or the need to develop case law to guide public officials regarding issues\n\nsuch as involuntary commitments or the use of Department of Corrections facilities to house\n\njuveniles. Sharma, 265 Ill App. 3d at 1029.\n\n        We also find guidance in the zoning case discussed above concerning the Baybrook\n\napartment construction project. There, the court declined to invoke the public interest exception\n\nto the mootness doctrine because (1) “any recurrence of the question of the validity of the [flood\n\nplain] ordinance would involve its application to [real] property other than Baybrook, with\n\ndifferent physical characteristics and different proposed uses” and (2) a determination of the\n\nfacial validity of the ordinance would have only limited utility in guiding the actions of public\n\nofficials. Village of Palatine, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 891-92.\n\n        Based on these authorities, we find the public interest exception is not appropriately\n\napplied to Hanna’s zoning action because the issues presented are not likely to recur to him on a\n\nrepeated basis. If it is true, as he argues, it is “a virtual certainty” the City will subsequently\n\n“engage[] in the type of arbitrary and irrational zoning policies and procedures challenged in\n\nHanna’s Complaint,” then the City’s conduct can be reviewed in the context of an actual\n\ncontroversy, when the plaintiff has a stake in the outcome and effectual relief can be granted.\n\nSharma, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 1029.\n\n        Hanna mistakenly contends “a similar scenario” justified invocation of the public interest\n\nexception in Johnson v. Edgar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2144018\"><a href=\"/opinion/2144018/johnson-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997). That case is dissimilar, in part because it\n\ninvolved legislation which two circuit court judges had separately determined was enacted in\n\nviolation of the constitutional prohibition on bills that encompass more than one subject.\n\n\n                                                   19\n\f1-06-3348\n\nJohnson, 176 Ill. 2d at 502. After the judges permanently enjoined enforcement of the public act,\n\nthe two cases were consolidated on appeal to the supreme court. Johnson, 176 Ill. 2d at 502.\n\nDuring the appeal, the legislation was partially amended, which ordinarily would have mooted\n\nthe appeal. Johnson, 176 Ill. 2d at 512. The parties agreed, however, that the criteria for the\n\npublic interest exception were satisfied. Johnson, 176 Ill. 2d at 513. Furthermore, the issue had\n\nbeen raised in at least one other case that was already pending in the trial court and the portion of\n\nthe legislation which was not amended was still open to challenge on the same basis. Johnson,\n\n176 Ill. 2d at 513. “Consequently, resolution of the [constitutional] challenge by [the supreme]\n\ncourt [would] be of assistance to both the lower courts and the public officers who [were] faced\n\nwith questions regarding the validity of the Act’s many provisions.” Johnson, 176 Ill. 2d at 513.\n\nIn contrast, the present action was not tried on the merits and was rendered moot during the\n\npleading stage when the plaintiff received the precise relief he was seeking. In addition, only the\n\nplaintiff, who has turned to the state and federal courts numerous times, contends the issues are\n\nstill worth litigating. Also, there is no indication in the record on appeal that the three rezonings\n\nof the plaintiff’s neighborhood are the basis of some other plaintiff’s complaint and should be\n\naddressed on an urgent basis to assist the trial court or public officials dealing with life-or-death\n\nissues, public health concerns, or other time-sensitive matters.\n\n       Moreover, Hanna’s reliance on Berrios v.

Berrios presented a question of\n\ninterest to every employee and employer litigating workers’ compensation claims in Illinois:\n\nwhether certain directives issued by the Illinois Industrial Commission were void because they\n\nviolated the Illinois Administrative Procedures Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 127, par. 1001 et\n\nseq.) Berrios, 190 Ill. App. 3d at 344. Morrison “easily [came within] the public interest\n\nexception,” because it concerned the minimum age for admission to public school in Illinois and\n\nthus affected potential kindergartners, as well as their families, and the school teachers and\n\nadministrators. Morrison, 188 Ill. App. 3d at 590-92. The issue in Labrenz was whether parents\n\ncould refuse on religious grounds blood transfusions for their critically ill infant and therefore\n\nimplicated not only the balance between governmental action and the religious beliefs of\n\nindividual citizens, but also presented a life-or-death issue which was likely to recur and become\n\nmoot by ordinary standards before it could be addressed by the courts. Labrenz, 411 Ill. at 623.\n\nHanna cannot show that the zoning classification of his neighborhood has comparably broad\n\nimpact on the public at large and urgently requires authoritative resolution.\n\n       Finally, Hanna contends “the City rezoned to RM5 to get Hanna out of court” and he\n\ncites Amoco Oil Co. v. Village of Schaumburg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2093059\"><a href=\"/opinion/2093059/amoco-oil-co-v-village-of-schaumburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995) for the proposition\n\nthat it is unconstitutional as a matter of law to enact an ordinance in order to resolve a lawsuit.\n\nHanna’s argument begs the question as to how conscientious public officials could permissibly\n\nresolve litigation that requires legislative action. Nevertheless, he argues that it was a “critical\n\nfact” in Amoco Oil that the municipality’s reason for legislating was to “get the case out of\n\nfederal court.” He urges this court to determine the City cannot legislate in order to end\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f1-06-3348\n\nlitigation, and, thus, give him effective relief and provide future guidance to public officials\n\nregarding the constitutional bounds of their powers.\n\n       The City does not concede that its sole motivation for the 2006 rezoning was to end this\n\nlawsuit and contends that the alderman’s December 2005 letter to neighborhood residents\n\nregarding the rezoning provides insight into the author’s perspective, but does not indicate the\n\nentire the city council shares her views. Assuming for the purposes of argument that the letter\n\nreveals the motivation for the 2006 rezoning, the City contends Amoco Oil is both factually and\n\nlegally distinguishable. Amoco Oil, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2093059\"><a href=\"/opinion/2093059/amoco-oil-co-v-village-of-schaumburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n       We find the City’s arguments persuasive. The alderman’s letter does not suggest she is\n\ncomprehensively stating her reasons for proposing the 2006 rezoning, nor does she purport to\n\nspeak for the entire the city council. Moreover, Hanna is misstating Amoco Oil’s holding\n\n(Amoco Oil, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2093059\"><a href=\"/opinion/2093059/amoco-oil-co-v-village-of-schaumburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">), and the case is too different from the present matter to be\n\ncontrolling. The municipality in Amoco Oil first adopted an ordinance indicating it was taking\n\n20% of the landowner’s property without compensation, as a condition for granting a special use\n\npermit allowing the landowner to redevelop the lot. Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 930. The\n\nlandowner, however, objected to the conditional granting and filed suit in federal court. Amoco\n\nOil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 930. The federal judge denied the landowner’s motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction, on the grounds that the landowner had a sufficient remedy at law for money damages,\n\nbut nonetheless conveyed its inclinations about the merits of the lawsuit:\n\n               “[I]f the public officials know that their actions are not supported\n\n               by the law and persist anyway, driven by some impression that they\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f1-06-3348\n\n               can attach these conditions because zoning ordinances constitute\n\n               some kind of public favor to be dispensed, that is certainly against\n\n               public policy.” Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 930.\n\nShortly thereafter, the municipality adopted an ordinance repealing the first ordinance, and the\n\nfederal court dismissed the action. Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 930-31. In other words, the\n\nmunicipality passed the repealing ordinance in an effort to deny the property owner any relief -- if\n\nthe municipality had its way, the landowner would have neither the special use permit necessary\n\nto redevelop its property nor any legal recourse. The landowner filed suit in state court,\n\nchallenging both the conditional granting and subsequent revocation of the special use permit.\n\nAmoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 927. The evidence presented at trial led the state appellate court\n\nto conclude the municipality’s attempted exaction of 20% of the property without just\n\ncompensation was an unconstitutional taking. Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 944. The court\n\nalso agreed “that the repealer ordinance was merely a transparent litigation tactic used to divest\n\nthe Federal court of continuing jurisdiction” (Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 934) and that it was\n\nnot a reasonable exercise of legislative authority to “repeal a zoning ordinance solely on the\n\ngrounds that the putative holder of a special use permit failed to comply with an unconstitutional\n\nexaction of property” (Amoco Oil, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 945). Thus, Amoco Oil does not stand for\n\nthe proposition that it is per se unconstitutional to legislate in order to resolve a lawsuit. Hanna\n\nhas not only misstated the court’s holding, but also cited authority with no factual resemblance to\n\nhis own dispute with the City. Here, the City of Chicago did not attempt to take a portion of\n\nHanna’s Mohawk Street property without just compensation, deny him the ability to redevelop\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f1-06-3348\n\nthe real estate, and deprive him to any legal recourse. Instead, the city council has given Hanna\n\nas much as possible under the current municipal zoning ordinance, conveyed what Hanna (or\n\nHanna’s attorney) deemed his effective and ultimate relief, and mooted the need for any further\n\nlitigation about the zoning classification applicable to his Mohawk Street land. Thus, the more\n\npertinent cases are ones such as Village of Skokie v. Gianoulis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2047626\"><a href=\"/opinion/2047626/village-of-skokie-v-gianoulis/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.
