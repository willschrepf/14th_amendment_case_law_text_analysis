Asemani’s pro se civil\n\nrights action, wherein he challenged various incidents that allegedly occurred while he\n\nwas incarcerated at LSCI-Allenwood. Asemani filed a motion for reconsideration on\n\nMarch 21, 2005, raising one issue: the District Court’s failure to specifically address his\n\nallegation that the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) placed him in administrative segregation as\n\na protective measure for more than 90 days without seeking approval from the BOP\n\nregional correctional administrator. The District Court denied the motion. Asemani\n\ntimely appealed.1\n\n       We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review the District Court’s\n\n\n\n\n   1\n     Although Asemani’s motion for reconsideration, filed within ten business days of the\nDistrict Court order granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, preserved\nreview of that underlying judgment, see Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A), we read his notice of\nappeal as seeking review only of the denial of his motion for reconsideration. Assuming\nthat Asemani had intended to challenge the underlying judgment, we nevertheless would\nhave summarily affirmed that decision, as the District Court properly determined that\nthere was no merit to his complaints about placement in administrative segregation, the\ndenial of dental care, retaliatory conduct, and the deduction of funds from his prison\naccount.\n\n                                             2\n\fdenial of Asemani’s motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. See Max’s\n\nSeafood Café v. Quinteros, 176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir. 1999). A motion for\n\nreconsideration filed pursuant to Rule 59(e) may be granted on one of the following\n\ngrounds: “(1) an intervening change in the controlling law; (2) the availability of new\n\nevidence that was not available . . . ; or (3) the need to correct a clear error of law or fact\n\nor to prevent injustice.” Id. at 677.\n\n       On June 14, 2002, Asemani alleged that he was sexually assaulted by a Physician’s\n\nAssistant at LSCI-Allenwood. Pursuant to BOP policy, Asemani was immediately moved\n\nfor his own protection to administrative segregation in the Special Housing Unit. He\n\nremained there until October 25, 2002, when his allegation was determined to be\n\nmeritless and the investigation closed. In his amended complaint, Asemani claimed that\n\nhe was housed in administrative segregation in retaliation for accusing the Physician’s\n\nAssistant of sexual assault, rather than for his own protection. The District Court\n\nconcluded that Asemani failed to provide any support for his claims of retaliation and\n\nthat, under the circumstances, his approximately four-month confinement in\n\nadministrative segregation did not constitute an “atypical and significant hardship.”\n\nRather than challenge these conclusions in his motion for reconsideration, Asemani\n\nargued that his constitutional rights were violated because prison officials did not seek or\n\nobtain BOP approval to continue his protective custody beyond 90 days as required by\n\none of its own Program Statements. Asemani argued that reconsideration was warranted\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fbecause the District Court failed to specifically address his Program Statement claim.\n\n       It is clear that this claim involves neither an intervening change in controlling law\n\nnor any newly discovered evidence. Moreover, the District Court did not commit a clear\n\nerror of law or create an injustice. The relevant inquiry was whether Asemani’s\n\nconfinement in administrative segregation imposed an atypical and significant hardship\n\non him in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life. See Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S.\n\n472, 484 (1995). The District Court’s conclusion that no such hardship existed\n\nencompassed Asemani’s allegations based on the Program Statement. See Wilkinson v.\n\nAustin, 545 U.S. 209, 223 (2005) (observing that “the touchstone of the inquiry into the\n\nexistence of a protected, state-created liberty interest in avoiding restrictive conditions of\n\nconfinement is not the language of regulations regarding those conditions but the nature\n\nof those conditions themselves in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.”\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the District Court’s order\n\ndenying the motion for reconsideration.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f",
