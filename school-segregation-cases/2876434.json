GIBSON, and MURPHY, Circuit Judges.\n                               ___________\n\nMURPHY, Circuit Judge.\n\n      This case involves competing interests under the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1499. Robert and Ann\nClynes sued the Fort Zumwalt public school district to obtain reimbursement\nfor the cost of sending their son Nicholas to a private school for learning\ndisabled children for the 1991-92 and 1992-93 school years. The district\ncourt awarded reimbursement to the Clynes, but denied their additional\nclaims for damages and interest. Both sides appeal from the aspects of the\njudgment unfavorable to them. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\f                                    I.\n\n      Nicholas Clynes was diagnosed with a learning disability in reading\nand math when he was in kindergarten at Hawthorne school, which is part of\nthe Fort Zumwalt school district. The school responded by developing an\nindividualized educational plan (IEP) each year as required by IDEA to set\nout a curriculum to address his disabilities. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414a(5).\nThe IEPs placed Nicholas in a classroom for learning disabled students part\nof each school day for individualized instruction in reading and math, but\nhe spent the rest of the day with non-disabled students. Nicholas attended\nHawthorne from kindergarten through third grade, and each year the school\naltered the amount of specialized instruction he received in response to\nhis needs.\n\n      Nicholas' parents attended meetings each year in which the IEPs were\ndiscussed.    The school district provided the Clynes with a written\nexplanation of their rights under IDEA, and Mrs. Clynes later testified\nthat she had read this information. In May 1991, the Clynes met with\ndistrict representatives to discuss the IEP for 1991-92. They expressed\nconcern with their son's progress and the way his needs were being\naddressed at Hawthorne. They did not sign the IEP and told the district\nthat they had enrolled Nicholas for summer school at Churchill, a private\nschool for the learning disabled.      Mrs. Clynes testified that she had\nindicated at the meeting that she preferred postponing any final decision\non the IEP until \"the first or second week of the fall, at that time I will\nhave more information.\" The IEP itself stated that it would be reviewed\nin September.\n\n      During the summer of 1991 Nicholas was admitted by Churchill for the\nschool year that would begin in the fall of 1991. In August the Clynes\ninformed the school district that Nicholas was going to attend Churchill\nfor the 1991-92 school year. He attended the school from the summer of\n1991 through at least the spring of 1993.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f      IDEA requires that a disabled child be provided with access to a free\nappropriate public education. Board of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 203\n(1982). Parents who believe their child's education falls short of the\nfederal standard may obtain a state administrative due process hearing, and\nin some cases may be awarded reimbursement to pay for private school costs.\nSee 20 U.S.C. 1415(b)(2) (review process);     School Comm. of Burlington,\nMass. v. Department of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 372 (1985) (reimbursement).\nThe final determination of the state administrative process may be appealed\nto federal district court, 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(2), and that court is to make\nan independent decision of the issues based on a preponderance of the\nevidence, giving \"due weight\" to the state administrative proceedings.\nRowley, 458 U.S. at 205-06. The level of deference accorded to the state\nproceedings is less than required under the substantial evidence test\ncommonly applied in federal administrative law cases, but consideration\nshould be given to the fact that the state hearing panel has had the\nopportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses. Independent Sch.\nDist. No. 283 v. S.D., 88 F.3d 556, 561 (8th Cir. 1996). Where there is\na conflict between the findings and conclusions of the hearing panel and\nthe final reviewing officer, a court may choose to credit the hearing\npanel's findings based on observation of the witnesses and reject the\nreviewing officer's analysis if it does not appear to give sufficient\nweight to the views of the professional educators.       See id.   Finally,\ncourts are not to \"substitute their own notions of sound educational policy\nfor those of the school authorities which they review.\" Rowley, 458 U.S.\nat 206.\n\n      The Clynes invoked the administrative process to seek reimbursement\nfor the cost of sending Nicholas to Churchill for the 1991-92 and 1992-93\nschool years. At the state hearing, both sides presented testimony and\noffered documentary evidence, and the hearing panel, composed of two\neducators and a lay person, applied the federal legal standard under IDEA.\nThe panel denied the Clynes' claim for reimbursement for both school years,\nconcluding that Nicholas had been making progress at Hawthorne, his\ndisability did not warrant complete segregation from non-disabled students,\nand the school district was prepared to provide a free adequate public\neducation to Nicholas.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f      The Clynes appealed this decision to a state level review officer\n(SLRO). The SLRO stated that it was not clear that the hearing panel had\ndetermined whether the education offered to Nicholas by the district was\nappropriate and that the panel had improperly placed the burden on the\nClynes to show that their son was regressing at Hawthorne.         The SLRO\ninferred that the district had not offered an adequate education program\nfor 1991-92 because the panel had proposed significant changes in the 1992-\n93 IEP as a result of Nicholas’ experience at Churchill.          The SLRO\ndescribed the prior IEPs as \"hit and miss\" and as not having produced a\ndemonstrable plan of progress. He believed the district had not identified\nproblem areas or applied appropriate resources in order to achieve\nsatisfactory results and that it had not explained why Nicholas'\nperformance is \"the best that can be expected from him.\" The SLRO reversed\nthe hearing panel decision with regard to the 1991-92 school year and\nordered reimbursement through the end of October 1992.1       Reimbursement\nbeyond that time would only be available if the Clynes could demonstrate\nthat they had been required to pre-pay tuition at Churchill without the\nright of refund.\n\n      The school district appealed the SLRO's decision to federal court.\nAfter a hearing the district court awarded reimbursement to the Clynes for\nboth the 1991-92 and 1992-93 school years, as well as the 1991 summer\nschool session. The court concluded that the 1991-92 IEP had not offered\nNicholas a free appropriate public education and that Nicholas' education\nat Churchill complied with IDEA.      It examined Nicholas' grades, test\nscores, and advancement from grade to grade at Hawthorne and found that\nNicholas had not benefited \"sufficiently\" from his education there and that\nthe 1991-92 IEP was inadequate. The IEP merely increased Nicholas' time\nin the learning disabled classroom and continued the past methods of\nteaching him to read, but it did not sufficiently address his needs or his\nbehavioral problems. The court also\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       The SLRO's award included reimbursement for the 1991 summer school session\nbecause he found Nicholas' participation in that session had been necessary in order to\nattend Churchill for the next school year.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fbelieved the 1992-93 IEP did not comply with IDEA requirements because it\ndid not offer appropriate reading instruction, was not designed to enable\nNicholas to \"recognize and accept his learning disabilities,\" and did not\noffer a completely segregated environment, which the court believed was the\nonly appropriate environment for him. It primarily based its order of\nreimbursement for the 1992-93 school year, however, on the fact that the\nIEP had not been developed until after Nicholas had started the year at\nChurchill, and the Clynes had contracted to pay for the entire year.\n\n                                   II.\n\n      Whether a school district has offered a free appropriate public\neducation is a mixed question of fact and law and the district court's\nultimate determination is reviewed de novo. Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist.\nv. Wartenberg, 59 F.3d 884, 891 (9th Cir. 1995) Hampton Sch. Dist. v.\nDobrowolski, 976 F.2d 48, 52 (1st Cir. 1992); but see Doyle v. Arlington\nCounty Sch. Bd., 953 F.2d 100, 105 (4th Cir. 1991) (\"whether or not a\nprogram is appropriate is a matter of fact\"). The standard of review in\nthis circuit is de novo as to the ultimate finding of the district court.\nSee Petersen v. Hastings Pub. Sch., 31 F.3d 705, 707-08 (8th Cir. 1994).\n      IDEA requires a school district to offer an educational program\n\"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational\nbenefits.\" Petersen, 31 F.3d at 707 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206-07).\nParents who believe their child will not receive an educational benefit\nunder an IEP may enroll the child in a private school and later obtain\nreimbursement for those costs if a federal court concludes (1) the school\ndistrict did not offer a free appropriate public education; and (2) the\nprivate school placement complied with IDEA. Florence County Sch. Dist.\nFour v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 13-14 (1993). Parents who enroll their child\nin private school without the approval of the public school district do so\nwith the risk they will not receive reimbursement for their costs. School\nComm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 373-74; Florence County, 510 U.S. at 15.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f      The goal of IDEA is to provide access to public education for all\nhandicapped students. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 179-81. Congress provided\nlimited resources to the states to implement the policy of educating all\ndisabled students, and the sufficiency of that education must be evaluated\nin light of the available resources. A.W. v. Northwest R-1 Sch. Dist., 813\nF.2d 158, 164 (8th Cir. 1987); see also Rowley, 458 U.S. at 179-81\n(intention to reach all unserved disabled students).         IDEA does not\nrequire that a school either maximize a student's potential or provide the\nbest possible education at public expense. Rowley at 203; A.W., 813 F.2d\nat 163-64.      The statute only requires that a public school provide\nsufficient specialized services so that the student benefits from his\neducation. Rowley, 458 U.S. at 195. IDEA's goal is \"more to open the door\nof public education to handicapped children on appropriate terms than to\nguarantee any particular level of education once inside.\"2 Id. at 192.\nIDEA requires disabled students to be educated with non-disabled students\nwhenever possible.     Id. at 202.     In determining whether a disabled\nstudent's education is sufficient under IDEA, courts must consider the\nnature of the student's disability. Id.\n      The district court made extensive factual findings based on a hearing\nand on evidence presented to the state hearing panel. The school district\ndiagnosed Nicholas as being delayed in reading and math by one year or more\nat the end of his first year at Hawthorne, and he subsequently repeated\nfirst grade.3 In May 1991, when Nicholas was in third grade, his reading\nskills were at the second grade level, his word attack skills (which enable\nreaders to identify words they have not seen before) were at the first\ngrade level, and he could not write a complete sentence. He had received\nthree Ds\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        The SLRO stated that the district must show that it has \"either produced\nsatisfactory results or has an explanation why the student's performance is the best that\ncan be expected from him.\" Under IDEA a school district is not required to maximize\na student's potential.\n      3\n       There was testimony at the state hearing that school authorities had wanted\nNicholas to repeat kindergarten, but that the Clynes insisted that Hawthorne promote\nhim to first grade.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fand an F in reading that year and mostly Cs in all other subjects. A\nstandardized test administered in September 1991, after Nicholas left\nHawthorne, placed his reading skills in the second to ninth percentile.\nNicholas' teachers at Hawthorne primarily used Dolch sight lists (visual\ncues and context) to teach him to read, but they also used phonics\n(auditory cues) to help him recognize words. Hawthorne emphasized use of\nthe Dolch sight lists because Nicholas was more successful with this\nmethod, but he had not learned how to read long words that he did not\nrecognize by sight. The school decreased the amount of time Nicholas spent\nin the learning disabled classroom from 26 percent in his second year in\nfirst grade to 13 percent of his time in third grade.\n\n      The district court found Nicholas had behavioral difficulties at\nHawthorne.   Evaluations of Nicholas done when he was in second grade\ncharacterized him as poorly motivated, easily frustrated, and feeling\ndifferent from his peers. The 1991-92 IEP placed him with non-disabled\nstudents for the majority of the day.      The court noted the following\nstatements of district personnel: his third grade teacher had said \"his\nattitude is reflected in his [poor] grades;\" his \"reading grade reflects\nhis effort;\" \"[h]e needs to stop the excuses & just work;\" and \"[o]ften he\nappears to be apathetic about school.\" The court also found that one of\nNicholas' teachers told Mrs. Clynes she did not know what else she could\ndo since Nicholas had chosen not to learn, and the director of special\neducation told her that some children are non-readers.\n\n      The district argues that Nicholas had made progress at Hawthorne and\nthe IEPs were sufficient to confer an educational benefit. The court erred\nby requiring a program to maximize Nicholas’ ability, by comparing his\nprogress to non-disabled students, and by failing to examine the IEPs from\nthe perspective of the time when they were written. The comments made by\neducators that were critical of Nicholas’ attitude should not have been\ninterpreted to mean that they had given up on addressing his problems, but\nrather as simply reflecting his behavior. Furthermore, the district court\ndid not properly consider IDEA’s requirement for educating disabled\nstudents in the least restrictive environment.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f      The Clynes respond by pointing out that Nicholas’ reading skills were\nvery weak when he left Hawthorne, that the public school system did not\neffectively address their concerns, and that the district had given up on\neducating him. Although the state hearing panel ruled in favor of the\ndistrict, it had recommended that it incorporate techniques used by the\nChurchill school.     The Clynes argue this recommendation necessarily\nsupports the inference that the 1991-92 IEP did not offer a free\nappropriate public education because it was generally different from the\nChurchill program. The 1992-93 IEP in turn was inadequate because it did\nnot incorporate the Churchill program as the state hearing panel had\nsuggested. The Clynes also contrast the benefits Nicholas received from\nhis education at Churchill with his difficulties at Hawthorne.\n\n      After studying the underlying factual findings of the district court\nin light of the record and legal standards under IDEA, we conclude that the\nschool district did offer Nicholas a free appropriate public education as\nrequired by Congress. Although Nicholas may well have benefited more from\nhis education at Churchill than at Hawthorne, and he did not read as well\nas his non-disabled peers or as his parents hoped, IDEA does not require\nthe best possible education or superior results. The statutory goal is to\nmake sure that every affected student receive a publicly funded education\nthat benefits the student. Nicholas' record at Hawthorne indicates that\nhe was making progress and that the 1991-92 IEP would have provided\neducational benefit to him. Despite his learning disabilities in reading\nand math, Nicholas earned passing marks in third grade4 and mostly Cs in\nmathematics. Although Nicholas did not have well developed word attack\nskills, his overall reading skills had improved, and he had been promoted\nto fourth grade just before his parents removed him from Hawthorne. See\nRowley at 203 (grades and advancement from grade to grade \"an important\nfactor[s] in determining educational benefit\"). The 1991-92 IEP called for\n\n\n\n\n      4\n       Nicholas received one failing grade in spelling in one quarter and another in\nreading in a different quarter, but he earned passing grades in both subjects in the other\nthree quarters.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fNicholas to spend over one quarter of each school day in the specialized\nlearning disabled classroom in order to address his disabilities, double\nthe amount of the previous year.     See id. at 196 (noting that Congress\n\"equated an 'appropriate education' to the receipt of some specialized\neducational services\"). The Hawthorne IEP set goals in word recognition,\ncomprehension, language skills and math, and the specialized education\nprovided was reasonably calculated to enable him to benefit from his public\neducation.5\n\n      The teaching methods used by Hawthorne were likely to confer an\neducational benefit. Although the district court was disturbed by the\nlevel of Nicholas' word attack skills and the emphasis on Dolch sight lists\nfor his reading instruction, it did not focus on the fact that the 1991-92\nIEP set goals for word attack or on the testimony that phonics was also to\nbe used. The court’s criticism of the educational methods used by the\ndistrict was not based on findings of the state educators who reviewed the\nmatter. Courts \"lack the specialized knowledge and experience necessary\nto resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy,\"\nRowley, 458 U.S. at 208 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted),\nand they must \"avoid imposing their view of preferable educational\nmethods.\"    Id. at 207.      No state educational authority criticized\nHawthorne's method of teaching Nicholas how to read. Both of the state\neducational experts on the hearing panel found that Nicholas had benefited\nfrom the instruction provided at Hawthorne.      As long as a student is\nbenefiting from his education, it is up to the educators to determine the\nappropriate educational methodology. Id. at 208.\n\n      Placement of disabled students in segregated environments is\nappropriate \"only when the nature or severity of the disability is such\nthat education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and\nservices cannot be achieved satisfactorily.\" 20\n\n\n\n\n      5\n        The increase in specialized education for 1991-92 and the district's willingness\nto review the IEP to consider what was learned from Nicholas' experience at summer\nschool belies the Clynes' assertion that the district had given up on educating Nicholas.\n\n                                          -9-\n\fU.S.C. § 1412 (5). Although Nicholas' behavior may have been affected by\nhis interaction with non-disabled peers, none of the state educational\nexperts concluded that Nicholas needed a segregated environment. The SLRO\nattributed his poor behavior to his difficulty in academic classes, not to\nhis association with non-disabled students, and the hearing panel indicated\nthat Nicholas should not be segregated from non-disabled students. The\n1991-92 IEP would have allowed Nicholas to interact with non-disabled\nstudents while providing educational benefit to him, and the conclusion of\nthe state educational reviewers that a segregated environment was not\nappropriate for him is another factor indicating that the Hawthorne program\ncomplied with IDEA.\n\n      Even though the 1991-92 IEP met IDEA's requirements, the school\ndistrict offered to improve it in the fall of 1991, but the Clynes removed\nNicholas from Hawthorne before the district had an opportunity to review\nthe IEP and attempt to come to agreement with them. Mrs. Clynes testified\nthat in May 1991 she told the school district that she did not agree with\nthe 1991-92 IEP, would not sign it, and would like it to be reviewed in the\nfall of 1991 in light of Nicholas’ summer program at Churchill. The 1991-92\nIEP itself stated that it was to be reviewed in September 1991, but before\nthat time came the Clynes informed the school district in August that\nNicholas had been enrolled in Churchill for the year. The abrupt removal\nof Nicholas from Hawthorne prevented the district from following through\non the request made by the Clynes for a review in the fall and from\nresponding to their then current concerns.6   See Evans v. District No. 17,\n841 F.2d 824, 831-32 (8th Cir. 1988) (no failure to provide free\nappropriate public education where the school district had not been given\nan opportunity to change the child's educational placement).\n\n\n\n\n      6\n        Contrary to the dissent's contention that the school district was unwilling to\nexplore any different approaches, there is evidence that the school district would have\naltered Nicholas' IEP upon his return from the summer at Churchill. The IEP developed\nin 1992 called for changes in his instruction as a result of his experience at Churchill.\n\n                                          -10-\n\f      In sum, the Clynes were not entitled to reimbursement from public\nfunds for the costs of sending Nicholas to private school in the summer of\n1991 and the 1991-92 school year. The 1991-92 IEP called for an increase\nin special educational services in Nicholas' areas of disability while\nadvancing IDEA’s mainstreaming purpose by placing him with non-disabled\nstudents for a substantial portion of the school day.     The IEP outlined\nhis particular needs and responded to them in compliance with IDEA, and\nHawthorne had agreed to consider possible improvements after Nicholas\nreturned from summer school.\n\n      The Clynes removed Nicholas from Hawthorne without the permission of\nthe school district before they sought review under IDEA, thus putting\nthemselves at risk that they would not be reimbursed for private school\ncosts. Evans, 841 F.2d at 832. Parents may not obtain reimbursement for\nthe time a child is placed in private school without the permission of the\nschool district if it is ultimately determined that the proposed IEP met\nthe IDEA requirements.     See   Burlington Sch. Comm., 471 U.S. at 374;\nEvans, 841 F.2d at 832; see also 34 C.F.R. § 300.403 (1997) (no requirement\nfor state to pay private school costs if child has available free\nappropriate public education).        Since the 1991-92 IEP met IDEA\nrequirements, the Clynes were not entitled under federal law to\nreimbursement for either the the 1991-92 or 1992-93 school years.7\n\n\n\n\n      7\n        The 1992-93 IEP developed by the school district also met IDEA requirements.\nIn August 1992, the school district offered to meet with the Clynes to resolve the issues\nrelating to Nicholas' educational placement, and they met that month. Nicholas was re-\nevaluated by the school district in September, and although he was enrolled at\nChurchill and his parents had not yet sought review by the state hearing panel, his IEP\nwas revised in October. The IEP called for double the amount of individualized special\neducation compared to the 1991-92 IEP, and four times the amount he had received in\n1990-91. The 1992-93 IEP set goals in, among other things, decoding, vocabulary,\ncomprehension, and written expression. At the same time, he was placed with non-\ndisabled students in non-academic subjects.\n\n                                          -11-\n\f                                   III.\n\n      The issues raised by the Clynes in their cross-appeal are without\nmerit.    They appeal the denial of their claim for reimbursement for\ninterest on loans they took out to pay for Nicholas' private school\neducation at Churchill.     We need not decide whether interest is ever\navailable under IDEA because by enrolling Nicholas at Churchill without the\npermission of the school district, the Clynes took the risk that they would\nnot receive reimbursement from public funds for their loans, let alone for\nthe interest on them. They also appeal the dismissal of their claims for\ndamages under IDEA, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.\n§12132; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of\n1973, § 794, for physical illness and emotional distress caused by the\ndistrict’s allegedly incompetent and unprofessional failure to provide\nNicholas with an adequate education.      The damage claim cannot succeed\nbecause the district offered Nicholas a free appropriate public education,\nand damages are not available for IDEA violations. Heidemann v. Rother,\n84 F.3d 1021, 1033 (8th Cir. 1996). We affirm the rulings of the district\ncourt on these issues.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n      For the reasons discussed, the public school district was not\nobligated to reimburse the Clynes for Nicholas' education at the Churchill\nprivate school, and the Clynes have not shown that the district court erred\nin denying them relief on their cross- appeal. We affirm in part, reverse\nin part, and remand for entry of judgment in favor of the school district.\n\n\nFloyd R. Gibson, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n      I agree that our decision in Heidemann v. Rother, 84 F.3d 1021, 1033\n(8th Cir. 1996), precludes the Clyneses from recovering damages in this\naction, and I can\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fconceive of no authority that would allow them compensation for interest\non loans they took out to pay for Nicholas's private schooling. Therefore,\nI concur in Part III of the Court's opinion. Nonetheless, because I would\naffirm the district court's judgment in toto, I respectfully dissent from\nPart II of the opinion.\n\n      IDEA makes available federal money to assist the states in educating\ndisabled children. See Board of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 179 (1982).\nTo share in these funds, participating states must agree to offer a \"free\nappropriate public education\" to all disabled children.       20 U.S.C. §\n1412(1) (1994). As a measure to ensure that Congressional goals are met,\nIDEA directs local school districts, in consultation with parents,\nteachers, and, where appropriate, the child himself, to develop an\n\"individualized education program\" (\"IEP\") for each disabled student. Id.\n§ 1401(18), (20).     An IEP satisfies IDEA's requirement of a free and\nappropriate education so long as it \"consists of educational instruction\nspecially designed to meet the unique needs of the [disabled] child,\nsupported by such services as are necessary to permit the child 'to\nbenefit' from the instruction.\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at 188-89.\n\n      If parents feel that their child's IEP does not afford a free\nappropriate public education, they may, under certain circumstances,\nunilaterally place the child in a private school pending administrative and\njudicial review of the IEP. See School Comm. of Burlington v. Department\nof Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985). This is, at least from a financial\nperspective, a perilous maneuver, for as the majority correctly recognizes,\nparents are entitled to reimbursement for the costs of enrolling their\ndisabled child in a private facility \"only if a federal court concludes\nboth that the public placement violated IDEA, and that the private school\nplacement was proper under the Act.\" Florence County Sch. Dist. Four v.\nCarter, 510 U.S. 7, 15 (1993). Applying this test to the facts of the\ninstant case, I agree with Judge Gunn that the Clyneses are entitled to\ncompensation for the expenses they incurred in sending Nicholas to the\nChurchill School.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f      Before proceeding to the merits of this appeal, a word must be said\nabout the applicable standard of review. We have described federal review\nof the state administrative process as a \"quite narrow\" endeavor. Petersen\nv. Hastings Pub. Sch., 31 F.3d 705, 707 (8th Cir. 1994). This is because\nthe federal courts do not possess \"the specialized knowledge and experience\nnecessary to resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational\npolicy,\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at 208 (quotations omitted), and we must\ntherefore give \"due weight\" to the state proceedings, id. at 206. In IDEA\ncases originating from a state such as Missouri, which has created a two-\ntiered administrative system, we must give deference to the opinion of the\nstate level review officer (\"SLRO\"), who is the person empowered to issue\na final decision for the state. See Thomas v. Cincinnati Bd. of Educ., 918\nF.2d 618, 624 (6th Cir. 1990)(\"[T]he only logical position, under Rowley\nand general principles of administrative law, is that federal courts are\nrequired to defer to the final decision of the state authorities, in this\ncase that of the SLRO.\"); Karl v. Board of Educ., 736 F.2d 873, 877 (2d\nCir. 1984)(\"We believe Rowley requires that federal courts defer to the\nfinal decision of the state authorities, and that deference may not be\neschewed merely because a decision is not unanimous or the reviewing\nauthority disagrees with the hearing officer.\"); cf. Independent Sch.\nDist. No. 283 v. S.D., 88 F.3d 556, 561 (8th Cir. 1996)(declining to\ndefinitively answer this question); Carlisle Area Sch. v. Scott P., 62 F.3d\n520, 528-30 (3d Cir. 1995)(deeming it appropriate to defer to opinion of\nstate appeals panel, but assuming that the federal courts should accord\nsomewhat less consideration to an appeals panel ruling that disregards a\nhearing officer's credibility findings which find support in the record),\ncert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 1419 (1996). Likewise, though the majority is\ncorrect in stating that we should examine de novo a district court's\nultimate determination of whether an IEP is appropriate, we are bound by\na district court's underlying factual findings unless they are clearly\nerroneous. See Yankton Sch. Dist. v. Schramm, 93 F.3d 1369, 1374 (8th Cir.\n1996).\n\n        In light of the detailed factual findings made by the district\ncourt, and giving \"due weight\" to the SLRO's determination that the IEP for\nthe 1991-1992 school year\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fwas inappropriate, I am unable to conclude that Fort Zumwalt provided\nNicholas a free appropriate public education for that period. The district\ncourt found that from September of 1989 to May of 1991 Nicholas's word\nattack skills had not risen above a first grade level, see Fort Zumwalt\nSch. Dist. v. Missouri State Bd. of Educ., 923 F. Supp. 1216, 1222 (E.D.\nMo. 1996), and a standardized test administered in September of 1991\nrevealed   that his reading proficiency ranked in the second to ninth\npercentile, see id. at 1224. At the close of his fifth year in the Fort\nZumwalt School District, Nicholas Clynes, at the age of ten, still did not\nknow the alphabet, could not recite the days of the week, and could not\nidentify the months of the year.8 See id. at 1222. It is true, as the\nmajority points out, that Fort Zumwalt promoted Nicholas to the fourth\ngrade, but it is notable that in third grade Nicholas did not receive a\nmark above a \"C.\" See id. at 1221. By the end of the year, Nicholas had\nfailed Spelling and had managed to raise a failing grade in Reading for the\nthird quarter to a \"D\" for the final quarter. See id.\n\n      In the face of these disturbing trends, Fort Zumwalt prepared an IEP\nfor 1991-1992 that did not propose any significant changes in Nicholas's\neducational placement. See id. at 1222. The IEP did set goals in word\nattack skills, but Nicholas's resource room instructor, Miss Ruhr,\ntestified that she would continue to emphasize the child's ability to\nrecognize the meaning of sighted words, a method that had failed miserably\nin the past to enhance Nicholas's reading aptitude.       See id.   At the\nmeeting to discuss the IEP, the Clyneses expressed concern with Nicholas's\ninability to read and asked what alternatives were available to their son.\nSee id.; App. at 459-60. The district reacted by attributing Nicholas's\nacademic shortcomings to his own poor attitude and refusal to put forth the\nrequisite effort. See Fort Zumwalt, 923 F. Supp. at 1222. Miss Ruhr\nstated that she had \"tried everything\" and did not \"know what else to do\";\nin her\n\n\n\n\n      8\n       At Nicholas's state due process hearing, his father, Robert Clynes, testified that\nthe child had mastered these tasks within two weeks after entering the Churchill\nSchool. App. at 477.\n\n                                          -15-\n\fopinion, Nicholas had \"chosen not to learn.\" See id.; App. at 26. Alarmed\nby this response, Mrs. Clynes later telephoned Pat Moore, Fort Zumwalt's\ndirector of special education, to discuss Nicholas's meager progress. See\nFort Zumwalt, 923 F. Supp. at 1222. Mrs. Moore informed the worried mother\nthat some children are simply \"non-readers\" despite the district's best\nefforts.    See id.   After deciding that the district had given up on\n         9\nNicholas, the Clyneses enrolled the child in the Churchill School.\n\n      I agree with the SLRO and the district court that the IEP for 1991-\n1992 was not designed to provide \"personalized instruction with sufficient\nsupport services to permit [Nicholas] to benefit educationally from that\ninstruction.\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at 203. By submitting an IEP substantially\nsimilar to others that had previously produced so few positive results, and\nby exhibiting an unwillingness to explore any different approaches,10 Fort\n\n\n      9\n       Mrs. Clynes's testimony regarding her conversation with Mrs. Moore provides\nrevealing insight into the parents' point of view:\n\n             At that time, you know, [after Mrs. Moore had made the remark]\n      about the non-reader, I then asked her if she had any knowledge of\n      Churchill. She said, \"Yes, I'm aware of Churchill but, no, I don't per se\n      know the programs, or anything like that,\" and I had let her know that,\n      \"I'm quite concerned that something needs to be done,\" that I had been to\n      my pediatrician, that, you know, \"He is recommending that Nick needs\n      more help in this area,\" and she made no offer whatsoever of maybe I\n      need to sit down with you, maybe we need to get together and see if\n      there's a better program for your son, at which time I proceeded to hang\n      up from her, call my husband and say, \"That's it, no one gives a blank\n      about our son, it's time for us to take control,\" and I did.\n\nApp. at 435-36.\n      10\n          The majority contends that \"[n]o state educational authority criticized [the\ndistrict]'s method of teaching Nicholas how to read,\" but the SLRO's decision included\nthe following admonition:\n\n             The various IEPs show a hit and miss approach to dealing with\n      [Nicholas's] failures. There was no focused effort to follow up on failures\n      and to produce a plan of progress that could be clearly demonstrated. The\n\n                                         -16-\n\fZumwalt did not extend to Nicholas the free and appropriate\n\n\n\n\n      District is not under any obligation to make Nicholas an honor student,\n      however it should demonstrate that it has identified the problem areas,\n      applied the appropriate resources and has either produced satisfactory\n      results or has an explanation why the student's performance is the best\n      that can be expected from him.\n\nApp. at 34-35 (emphasis added). While this might not be an outright condemnation of\nFort Zumwalt's teaching methods, it comes very close, and it certainly discloses the\nSLRO's assessment that the IEP was clearly deficient. Cf., e.g., 20 U.S.C. §\n1401(20)(F) (instructing that an IEP should contain \"appropriate objective criteria and\nevaluation procedures and schedules for determining, on at least an annual basis,\nwhether instructional objectives are being achieved\").\n\n                                         -17-\n\feducation mandated by IDEA. To be sure, Nicholas was steadily advancing\nfrom grade to grade in the Fort Zumwalt schools, and the Supreme Court has\nstressed that \"[t]he grading and advancement system . . . constitutes an\nimportant factor in determining educational benefit,\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at\n203, but Nicholas's achievements, particularly in the area of reading\nskills, can at best be described as trivial. This cannot be the sort of\neducation Congress had in mind when it enacted IDEA.        See Mrs. B. v.\nMilford Bd. of Educ., 103 F.3d 1114, 1120-21 (2d Cir. 1997)(reasoning that\nthe Rowley standard contemplates more than mere trivial advancement); Polk\nv. Central Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16, 853 F.2d 171, 183 (3d Cir.\n1988)(\"[W]hen the Supreme Court said 'some benefit' in Rowley, it did not\nmean 'some' as opposed to 'none.' Rather, 'some' connotes an amount of\nbenefit greater than mere trivial advancement.\"), cert denied, 488 U.S.\n1030 (1989); Hall v. Vance County Bd. of Educ., 774 F.2d 629, 636 (4th Cir.\n1985)(\"Clearly, Congress did not intend that a school system could\ndischarge its duty under [IDEA] by providing a program that produces some\nminimal academic advancement, no matter how trivial.\"); cf. Rowley, 458\nU.S. at 203 n.25 (\"We do not hold today that every [disabled] child who is\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fadvancing from grade to grade in a regular public school system is\nautomatically receiving a 'free appropriate public education.'\").    The\nmajority, in resolving that Fort Zumwalt did offer Nicholas a free\nappropriate public education, not only does disservice to Congressional\nintent, but also disregards the deference we are required to give to the\nconclusion reached by the SLRO.11\n\n\n\n\n      11\n         The Court does not seem to place dispositive weight upon our decision in\nEvans v. District No. 17, 841 F.2d 824 (8th Cir. 1988), but the Court does suggest that\nthe Clyneses did not comply with the notice requirement we announced in that case.\nI disagree. In Evans, we affirmed the district court's denial of reimbursement to parents\nwho had precipitously enrolled their child in a private school, explaining that \"[a]\nschool district should be on notice of disagreements and given an opportunity to make\na voluntary decision to change or alter the educational placement of a [disabled] child.\"\nId. at 831-32. We acknowledged, however, that parents may independently choose an\nappropriate private placement \"if it is likely that no change would be made which\nwould benefit [the child] (if the school district had made it clear that no change in the\nplacement would occur).\" Id. at 832.\n\n        Unlike the claimants in Evans, see id. at 831, the Clyneses specifically requested\nsome alternative placement for Nicholas. See App. at 460 (\"[A]t th[e IEP] meeting I\nsaid, 'Well, what else can you offer, self-contained?'\"); App. at 475-76 (\"During the\n[IEP] meeting we said we were very dissatisfied with what was happening with Nick,\nhe still wasn't learning. We asked them at that point in time what other programs they\nhad, and my wife mentioned self-contained, and they said at that point in time Nick was\nnot a candidate for self-contained.\"); App. at 435-36 (\"I had let [Pat Moore] know that,\n'I'm quite concerned that something needs to be done,' that I had been to my\npediatrician, that, you know, 'He is recommending that Nick needs more help in this\narea,' and she made no offer [of help].\"). The position adopted by Nicholas's educators\nin answer to these pleas, as disclosed by statements at the IEP meeting and Mrs.\nMoore's comments to Mrs. Clynes, evidenced a likelihood that \"no change would be\nmade which would benefit [Nicholas],\" Evans, 841 F.2d at 832, and there is absolutely\nno reason to believe that the district would have drastically altered its stance had it\nreceived one more opportunity to assess the IEP. Consequently, I do not think\nEvans stands as an impediment to reimbursement in this case.\n\n                                          -19-\n\f      In sum, I think the district court properly decided that the 1991-\n1992 IEP was deficient. I additionally believe the Churchill School was\nwithout a doubt an appropriate placement for Nicholas (the facts confirm\nhis improvement at that school),12 and I would thus hold that the Clyneses\nare entitled to reimbursement for the summer of 1991 and the 1991-92 school\nyear. Furthermore, because the district did not prepare the 1992-93 IEP\nuntil after the Clyneses had contractually committed to send Nicholas to\nChurchill for that term, I would also approve reimbursement for the 1992-93\nschool year.     To the extent the majority has decided otherwise, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\nA true copy:\n\n      Attest:\n\n             CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n      12\n         Having determined that Fort Zumwalt did offer Nicholas a free appropriate\npublic education, the majority has apparently found it unnecessary to evaluate the\npropriety of placement at the Churchill School. The Court does, though, mention\nIDEA's mainstreaming requirement. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(5) (1994). I would hold\nthat the preference for mainstreaming is honored where parents send their child to an\nacademy, such as the Churchill School, which employs a curriculum designed to\nprepare the student for a return to a regular classroom environment.\n\n                                        -20-\n\f",

Robert and Ann\nClynes sued the Fort Zumwalt public school district to obtain reimbursement\nfor the cost of sending their son Nicholas to a private school for learning\ndisabled children for the 1991-92 and 1992-93 school years. The district\ncourt awarded reimbursement to the Clynes, but denied their additional\nclaims for damages and interest. Both sides appeal from the aspects of the\njudgment unfavorable to them. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\f                                    I.\n\n      Nicholas Clynes was diagnosed with a learning disability in reading\nand math when he was in kindergarten at Hawthorne school, which is part of\nthe Fort Zumwalt school district. The school responded by developing an\nindividualized educational plan (IEP) each year as required by IDEA to set\nout a curriculum to address his disabilities. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414a(5).\nThe IEPs placed Nicholas in a classroom for learning disabled students part\nof each school day for individualized instruction in reading and math, but\nhe spent the rest of the day with non-disabled students. Nicholas attended\nHawthorne from kindergarten through third grade, and each year the school\naltered the amount of specialized instruction he received in response to\nhis needs.\n\n      Nicholas' parents attended meetings each year in which the IEPs were\ndiscussed.    The school district provided the Clynes with a written\nexplanation of their rights under IDEA, and Mrs. Clynes later testified\nthat she had read this information. In May 1991, the Clynes met with\ndistrict representatives to discuss the IEP for 1991-92. They expressed\nconcern with their son's progress and the way his needs were being\naddressed at Hawthorne. They did not sign the IEP and told the district\nthat they had enrolled Nicholas for summer school at Churchill, a private\nschool for the learning disabled.      Mrs. Clynes testified that she had\nindicated at the meeting that she preferred postponing any final decision\non the IEP until \"the first or second week of the fall, at that time I will\nhave more information.\" The IEP itself stated that it would be reviewed\nin September.\n\n      During the summer of 1991 Nicholas was admitted by Churchill for the\nschool year that would begin in the fall of 1991. In August the Clynes\ninformed the school district that Nicholas was going to attend Churchill\nfor the 1991-92 school year. He attended the school from the summer of\n1991 through at least the spring of 1993.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f      IDEA requires that a disabled child be provided with access to a free\nappropriate public education.

Finally,\ncourts are not to \"substitute their own notions of sound educational policy\nfor those of the school authorities which they review.\" Rowley, 458 U.S.\nat 206.\n\n      The Clynes invoked the administrative process to seek reimbursement\nfor the cost of sending Nicholas to Churchill for the 1991-92 and 1992-93\nschool years. At the state hearing, both sides presented testimony and\noffered documentary evidence, and the hearing panel, composed of two\neducators and a lay person, applied the federal legal standard under IDEA.\nThe panel denied the Clynes' claim for reimbursement for both school years,\nconcluding that Nicholas had been making progress at Hawthorne, his\ndisability did not warrant complete segregation from non-disabled students,\nand the school district was prepared to provide a free adequate public\neducation to Nicholas.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f      The Clynes appealed this decision to a state level review officer\n(SLRO). The SLRO stated that it was not clear that the hearing panel had\ndetermined whether the education offered to Nicholas by the district was\nappropriate and that the panel had improperly placed the burden on the\nClynes to show that their son was regressing at Hawthorne.         The SLRO\ninferred that the district had not offered an adequate education program\nfor 1991-92 because the panel had proposed significant changes in the 1992-\n93 IEP as a result of Nicholas’ experience at Churchill.          The SLRO\ndescribed the prior IEPs as \"hit and miss\" and as not having produced a\ndemonstrable plan of progress. He believed the district had not identified\nproblem areas or applied appropriate resources in order to achieve\nsatisfactory results and that it had not explained why Nicholas'\nperformance is \"the best that can be expected from him.\" The SLRO reversed\nthe hearing panel decision with regard to the 1991-92 school year and\nordered reimbursement through the end of October 1992.1       Reimbursement\nbeyond that time would only be available if the Clynes could demonstrate\nthat they had been required to pre-pay tuition at Churchill without the\nright of refund.\n\n      The school district appealed the SLRO's decision to federal court.\nAfter a hearing the district court awarded reimbursement to the Clynes for\nboth the 1991-92 and 1992-93 school years, as well as the 1991 summer\nschool session. The court concluded that the 1991-92 IEP had not offered\nNicholas a free appropriate public education and that Nicholas' education\nat Churchill complied with IDEA.      It examined Nicholas' grades, test\nscores, and advancement from grade to grade at Hawthorne and found that\nNicholas had not benefited \"sufficiently\" from his education there and that\nthe 1991-92 IEP was inadequate. The IEP merely increased Nicholas' time\nin the learning disabled classroom and continued the past methods of\nteaching him to read, but it did not sufficiently address his needs or his\nbehavioral problems. The court also\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       The SLRO's award included reimbursement for the 1991 summer school session\nbecause he found Nicholas' participation in that session had been necessary in order to\nattend Churchill for the next school year.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fbelieved the 1992-93 IEP did not comply with IDEA requirements because it\ndid not offer appropriate reading instruction, was not designed to enable\nNicholas to \"recognize and accept his learning disabilities,\" and did not\noffer a completely segregated environment, which the court believed was the\nonly appropriate environment for him. It primarily based its order of\nreimbursement for the 1992-93 school year, however, on the fact that the\nIEP had not been developed until after Nicholas had started the year at\nChurchill, and the Clynes had contracted to pay for the entire year.\n\n                                   II.\n\n      Whether a school district has offered a free appropriate public\neducation is a mixed question of fact and law and the district court's\nultimate determination is reviewed de novo.

The statute only requires that a public school provide\nsufficient specialized services so that the student benefits from his\neducation. Rowley, 458 U.S. at 195. IDEA's goal is \"more to open the door\nof public education to handicapped children on appropriate terms than to\nguarantee any particular level of education once inside.\"2 Id. at 192.\nIDEA requires disabled students to be educated with non-disabled students\nwhenever possible.     Id. at 202.     In determining whether a disabled\nstudent's education is sufficient under IDEA, courts must consider the\nnature of the student's disability. Id.\n      The district court made extensive factual findings based on a hearing\nand on evidence presented to the state hearing panel. The school district\ndiagnosed Nicholas as being delayed in reading and math by one year or more\nat the end of his first year at Hawthorne, and he subsequently repeated\nfirst grade.3 In May 1991, when Nicholas was in third grade, his reading\nskills were at the second grade level, his word attack skills (which enable\nreaders to identify words they have not seen before) were at the first\ngrade level, and he could not write a complete sentence. He had received\nthree Ds\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        The SLRO stated that the district must show that it has \"either produced\nsatisfactory results or has an explanation why the student's performance is the best that\ncan be expected from him.\" Under IDEA a school district is not required to maximize\na student's potential.\n      3\n       There was testimony at the state hearing that school authorities had wanted\nNicholas to repeat kindergarten, but that the Clynes insisted that Hawthorne promote\nhim to first grade.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fand an F in reading that year and mostly Cs in all other subjects. A\nstandardized test administered in September 1991, after Nicholas left\nHawthorne, placed his reading skills in the second to ninth percentile.\nNicholas' teachers at Hawthorne primarily used Dolch sight lists (visual\ncues and context) to teach him to read, but they also used phonics\n(auditory cues) to help him recognize words. Hawthorne emphasized use of\nthe Dolch sight lists because Nicholas was more successful with this\nmethod, but he had not learned how to read long words that he did not\nrecognize by sight. The school decreased the amount of time Nicholas spent\nin the learning disabled classroom from 26 percent in his second year in\nfirst grade to 13 percent of his time in third grade.\n\n      The district court found Nicholas had behavioral difficulties at\nHawthorne.   Evaluations of Nicholas done when he was in second grade\ncharacterized him as poorly motivated, easily frustrated, and feeling\ndifferent from his peers. The 1991-92 IEP placed him with non-disabled\nstudents for the majority of the day.      The court noted the following\nstatements of district personnel: his third grade teacher had said \"his\nattitude is reflected in his [poor] grades;\" his \"reading grade reflects\nhis effort;\" \"[h]e needs to stop the excuses & just work;\" and \"[o]ften he\nappears to be apathetic about school.\" The court also found that one of\nNicholas' teachers told Mrs. Clynes she did not know what else she could\ndo since Nicholas had chosen not to learn, and the director of special\neducation told her that some children are non-readers.\n\n      The district argues that Nicholas had made progress at Hawthorne and\nthe IEPs were sufficient to confer an educational benefit. The court erred\nby requiring a program to maximize Nicholas’ ability, by comparing his\nprogress to non-disabled students, and by failing to examine the IEPs from\nthe perspective of the time when they were written. The comments made by\neducators that were critical of Nicholas’ attitude should not have been\ninterpreted to mean that they had given up on addressing his problems, but\nrather as simply reflecting his behavior. Furthermore, the district court\ndid not properly consider IDEA’s requirement for educating disabled\nstudents in the least restrictive environment.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f      The Clynes respond by pointing out that Nicholas’ reading skills were\nvery weak when he left Hawthorne, that the public school system did not\neffectively address their concerns, and that the district had given up on\neducating him. Although the state hearing panel ruled in favor of the\ndistrict, it had recommended that it incorporate techniques used by the\nChurchill school.     The Clynes argue this recommendation necessarily\nsupports the inference that the 1991-92 IEP did not offer a free\nappropriate public education because it was generally different from the\nChurchill program. The 1992-93 IEP in turn was inadequate because it did\nnot incorporate the Churchill program as the state hearing panel had\nsuggested. The Clynes also contrast the benefits Nicholas received from\nhis education at Churchill with his difficulties at Hawthorne.\n\n      After studying the underlying factual findings of the district court\nin light of the record and legal standards under IDEA, we conclude that the\nschool district did offer Nicholas a free appropriate public education as\nrequired by Congress. Although Nicholas may well have benefited more from\nhis education at Churchill than at Hawthorne, and he did not read as well\nas his non-disabled peers or as his parents hoped, IDEA does not require\nthe best possible education or superior results. The statutory goal is to\nmake sure that every affected student receive a publicly funded education\nthat benefits the student. Nicholas' record at Hawthorne indicates that\nhe was making progress and that the 1991-92 IEP would have provided\neducational benefit to him. Despite his learning disabilities in reading\nand math, Nicholas earned passing marks in third grade4 and mostly Cs in\nmathematics. Although Nicholas did not have well developed word attack\nskills, his overall reading skills had improved, and he had been promoted\nto fourth grade just before his parents removed him from Hawthorne. See\nRowley at 203 (grades and advancement from grade to grade \"an important\nfactor[s] in determining educational benefit\"). The 1991-92 IEP called for\n\n\n\n\n      4\n       Nicholas received one failing grade in spelling in one quarter and another in\nreading in a different quarter, but he earned passing grades in both subjects in the other\nthree quarters.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fNicholas to spend over one quarter of each school day in the specialized\nlearning disabled classroom in order to address his disabilities, double\nthe amount of the previous year.     See id. at 196 (noting that Congress\n\"equated an 'appropriate education' to the receipt of some specialized\neducational services\"). The Hawthorne IEP set goals in word recognition,\ncomprehension, language skills and math, and the specialized education\nprovided was reasonably calculated to enable him to benefit from his public\neducation.5\n\n      The teaching methods used by Hawthorne were likely to confer an\neducational benefit. Although the district court was disturbed by the\nlevel of Nicholas' word attack skills and the emphasis on Dolch sight lists\nfor his reading instruction, it did not focus on the fact that the 1991-92\nIEP set goals for word attack or on the testimony that phonics was also to\nbe used. The court’s criticism of the educational methods used by the\ndistrict was not based on findings of the state educators who reviewed the\nmatter. Courts \"lack the specialized knowledge and experience necessary\nto resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy,\"\nRowley, 458 U.S. at 208 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted),\nand they must \"avoid imposing their view of preferable educational\nmethods.\"    Id. at 207.      No state educational authority criticized\nHawthorne's method of teaching Nicholas how to read. Both of the state\neducational experts on the hearing panel found that Nicholas had benefited\nfrom the instruction provided at Hawthorne.      As long as a student is\nbenefiting from his education, it is up to the educators to determine the\nappropriate educational methodology. Id. at 208.\n\n      Placement of disabled students in segregated environments is\nappropriate \"only when the nature or severity of the disability is such\nthat education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and\nservices cannot be achieved satisfactorily.\" 20\n\n\n\n\n      5\n        The increase in specialized education for 1991-92 and the district's willingness\nto review the IEP to consider what was learned from Nicholas' experience at summer\nschool belies the Clynes' assertion that the district had given up on educating Nicholas.\n\n                                          -9-\n\fU.S.C. § 1412 (5). Although Nicholas' behavior may have been affected by\nhis interaction with non-disabled peers, none of the state educational\nexperts concluded that Nicholas needed a segregated environment. The SLRO\nattributed his poor behavior to his difficulty in academic classes, not to\nhis association with non-disabled students, and the hearing panel indicated\nthat Nicholas should not be segregated from non-disabled students. The\n1991-92 IEP would have allowed Nicholas to interact with non-disabled\nstudents while providing educational benefit to him, and the conclusion of\nthe state educational reviewers that a segregated environment was not\nappropriate for him is another factor indicating that the Hawthorne program\ncomplied with IDEA.\n\n      Even though the 1991-92 IEP met IDEA's requirements, the school\ndistrict offered to improve it in the fall of 1991, but the Clynes removed\nNicholas from Hawthorne before the district had an opportunity to review\nthe IEP and attempt to come to agreement with them. Mrs. Clynes testified\nthat in May 1991 she told the school district that she did not agree with\nthe 1991-92 IEP, would not sign it, and would like it to be reviewed in the\nfall of 1991 in light of Nicholas’ summer program at Churchill. The 1991-92\nIEP itself stated that it was to be reviewed in September 1991, but before\nthat time came the Clynes informed the school district in August that\nNicholas had been enrolled in Churchill for the year. The abrupt removal\nof Nicholas from Hawthorne prevented the district from following through\non the request made by the Clynes for a review in the fall and from\nresponding to their then current concerns.6   See Evans v.

The 1991-92 IEP called for an increase\nin special educational services in Nicholas' areas of disability while\nadvancing IDEA’s mainstreaming purpose by placing him with non-disabled\nstudents for a substantial portion of the school day.     The IEP outlined\nhis particular needs and responded to them in compliance with IDEA, and\nHawthorne had agreed to consider possible improvements after Nicholas\nreturned from summer school.\n\n      The Clynes removed Nicholas from Hawthorne without the permission of\nthe school district before they sought review under IDEA, thus putting\nthemselves at risk that they would not be reimbursed for private school\ncosts. Evans, 841 F.2d at 832. Parents may not obtain reimbursement for\nthe time a child is placed in private school without the permission of the\nschool district if it is ultimately determined that the proposed IEP met\nthe IDEA requirements.     See   Burlington Sch. Comm., 471 U.S. at 374;\nEvans, 841 F.2d at 832; see also 34 C.F.R. § 300.403 (1997) (no requirement\nfor state to pay private school costs if child has available free\nappropriate public education).        Since the 1991-92 IEP met IDEA\nrequirements, the Clynes were not entitled under federal law to\nreimbursement for either the the 1991-92 or 1992-93 school years.7\n\n\n\n\n      7\n        The 1992-93 IEP developed by the school district also met IDEA requirements.\nIn August 1992, the school district offered to meet with the Clynes to resolve the issues\nrelating to Nicholas' educational placement, and they met that month. Nicholas was re-\nevaluated by the school district in September, and although he was enrolled at\nChurchill and his parents had not yet sought review by the state hearing panel, his IEP\nwas revised in October. The IEP called for double the amount of individualized special\neducation compared to the 1991-92 IEP, and four times the amount he had received in\n1990-91. The 1992-93 IEP set goals in, among other things, decoding, vocabulary,\ncomprehension, and written expression. At the same time, he was placed with non-\ndisabled students in non-academic subjects.\n\n                                          -11-\n\f                                   III.\n\n      The issues raised by the Clynes in their cross-appeal are without\nmerit.    They appeal the denial of their claim for reimbursement for\ninterest on loans they took out to pay for Nicholas' private school\neducation at Churchill.     We need not decide whether interest is ever\navailable under IDEA because by enrolling Nicholas at Churchill without the\npermission of the school district, the Clynes took the risk that they would\nnot receive reimbursement from public funds for their loans, let alone for\nthe interest on them. They also appeal the dismissal of their claims for\ndamages under IDEA, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.\n§12132; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of\n1973, § 794, for physical illness and emotional distress caused by the\ndistrict’s allegedly incompetent and unprofessional failure to provide\nNicholas with an adequate education.

At the close of his fifth year in the Fort\nZumwalt School District, Nicholas Clynes, at the age of ten, still did not\nknow the alphabet, could not recite the days of the week, and could not\nidentify the months of the year.8 See id. at 1222. It is true, as the\nmajority points out, that Fort Zumwalt promoted Nicholas to the fourth\ngrade, but it is notable that in third grade Nicholas did not receive a\nmark above a \"C.\" See id. at 1221. By the end of the year, Nicholas had\nfailed Spelling and had managed to raise a failing grade in Reading for the\nthird quarter to a \"D\" for the final quarter. See id.\n\n      In the face of these disturbing trends, Fort Zumwalt prepared an IEP\nfor 1991-1992 that did not propose any significant changes in Nicholas's\neducational placement. See id. at 1222. The IEP did set goals in word\nattack skills, but Nicholas's resource room instructor, Miss Ruhr,\ntestified that she would continue to emphasize the child's ability to\nrecognize the meaning of sighted words, a method that had failed miserably\nin the past to enhance Nicholas's reading aptitude.       See id.   At the\nmeeting to discuss the IEP, the Clyneses expressed concern with Nicholas's\ninability to read and asked what alternatives were available to their son.\nSee id.; App. at 459-60. The district reacted by attributing Nicholas's\nacademic shortcomings to his own poor attitude and refusal to put forth the\nrequisite effort. See Fort Zumwalt, 923 F. Supp. at 1222. Miss Ruhr\nstated that she had \"tried everything\" and did not \"know what else to do\";\nin her\n\n\n\n\n      8\n       At Nicholas's state due process hearing, his father, Robert Clynes, testified that\nthe child had mastered these tasks within two weeks after entering the Churchill\nSchool. App. at 477.\n\n                                          -15-\n\fopinion, Nicholas had \"chosen not to learn.\" See id.; App. at 26. Alarmed\nby this response, Mrs. Clynes later telephoned Pat Moore, Fort Zumwalt's\ndirector of special education, to discuss Nicholas's meager progress. See\nFort Zumwalt, 923 F. Supp. at 1222. Mrs. Moore informed the worried mother\nthat some children are simply \"non-readers\" despite the district's best\nefforts.    See id.   After deciding that the district had given up on\n         9\nNicholas, the Clyneses enrolled the child in the Churchill School.\n\n      I agree with the SLRO and the district court that the IEP for 1991-\n1992 was not designed to provide \"personalized instruction with sufficient\nsupport services to permit [Nicholas] to benefit educationally from that\ninstruction.\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at 203. By submitting an IEP substantially\nsimilar to others that had previously produced so few positive results, and\nby exhibiting an unwillingness to explore any different approaches,10 Fort\n\n\n      9\n       Mrs. Clynes's testimony regarding her conversation with Mrs. Moore provides\nrevealing insight into the parents' point of view:\n\n             At that time, you know, [after Mrs. Moore had made the remark]\n      about the non-reader, I then asked her if she had any knowledge of\n      Churchill. She said, \"Yes, I'm aware of Churchill but, no, I don't per se\n      know the programs, or anything like that,\" and I had let her know that,\n      \"I'm quite concerned that something needs to be done,\" that I had been to\n      my pediatrician, that, you know, \"He is recommending that Nick needs\n      more help in this area,\" and she made no offer whatsoever of maybe I\n      need to sit down with you, maybe we need to get together and see if\n      there's a better program for your son, at which time I proceeded to hang\n      up from her, call my husband and say, \"That's it, no one gives a blank\n      about our son, it's time for us to take control,\" and I did.\n\nApp. at 435-36.\n      10\n          The majority contends that \"[n]o state educational authority criticized [the\ndistrict]'s method of teaching Nicholas how to read,\" but the SLRO's decision included\nthe following admonition:\n\n             The various IEPs show a hit and miss approach to dealing with\n      [Nicholas's] failures. There was no focused effort to follow up on failures\n      and to produce a plan of progress that could be clearly demonstrated. The\n\n                                         -16-\n\fZumwalt did not extend to Nicholas the free and appropriate\n\n\n\n\n      District is not under any obligation to make Nicholas an honor student,\n      however it should demonstrate that it has identified the problem areas,\n      applied the appropriate resources and has either produced satisfactory\n      results or has an explanation why the student's performance is the best\n      that can be expected from him.\n\nApp. at 34-35 (emphasis added). While this might not be an outright condemnation of\nFort Zumwalt's teaching methods, it comes very close, and it certainly discloses the\nSLRO's assessment that the IEP was clearly deficient. Cf., e.g., 20 U.S.C. §\n1401(20)(F) (instructing that an IEP should contain \"appropriate objective criteria and\nevaluation procedures and schedules for determining, on at least an annual basis,\nwhether instructional objectives are being achieved\").\n\n                                         -17-\n\feducation mandated by IDEA. To be sure, Nicholas was steadily advancing\nfrom grade to grade in the Fort Zumwalt schools, and the Supreme Court has\nstressed that \"[t]he grading and advancement system . . . constitutes an\nimportant factor in determining educational benefit,\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at\n203, but Nicholas's achievements, particularly in the area of reading\nskills, can at best be described as trivial.

Rowley, 458\nU.S. at 203 n.25 (\"We do not hold today that every [disabled] child who is\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fadvancing from grade to grade in a regular public school system is\nautomatically receiving a 'free appropriate public education.'\").    The\nmajority, in resolving that Fort Zumwalt did offer Nicholas a free\nappropriate public education, not only does disservice to Congressional\nintent, but also disregards the deference we are required to give to the\nconclusion reached by the SLRO.11\n\n\n\n\n      11\n         The Court does not seem to place dispositive weight upon our decision in\nEvans v.

In Evans, we affirmed the district court's denial of reimbursement to parents\nwho had precipitously enrolled their child in a private school, explaining that \"[a]\nschool district should be on notice of disagreements and given an opportunity to make\na voluntary decision to change or alter the educational placement of a [disabled] child.\"\nId. at 831-32. We acknowledged, however, that parents may independently choose an\nappropriate private placement \"if it is likely that no change would be made which\nwould benefit [the child] (if the school district had made it clear that no change in the\nplacement would occur).\" Id. at 832.\n\n        Unlike the claimants in Evans, see id. at 831, the Clyneses specifically requested\nsome alternative placement for Nicholas. See App. at 460 (\"[A]t th[e IEP] meeting I\nsaid, 'Well, what else can you offer, self-contained?'\"); App. at 475-76 (\"During the\n[IEP] meeting we said we were very dissatisfied with what was happening with Nick,\nhe still wasn't learning. We asked them at that point in time what other programs they\nhad, and my wife mentioned self-contained, and they said at that point in time Nick was\nnot a candidate for self-contained.\"); App. at 435-36 (\"I had let [Pat Moore] know that,\n'I'm quite concerned that something needs to be done,' that I had been to my\npediatrician, that, you know, 'He is recommending that Nick needs more help in this\narea,' and she made no offer [of help].\"). The position adopted by Nicholas's educators\nin answer to these pleas, as disclosed by statements at the IEP meeting and Mrs.\nMoore's comments to Mrs. Clynes, evidenced a likelihood that \"no change would be\nmade which would benefit [Nicholas],\" Evans, 841 F.2d at 832, and there is absolutely\nno reason to believe that the district would have drastically altered its stance had it\nreceived one more opportunity to assess the IEP. Consequently, I do not think\nEvans stands as an impediment to reimbursement in this case.\n\n                                          -19-\n\f      In sum, I think the district court properly decided that the 1991-\n1992 IEP was deficient. I additionally believe the Churchill School was\nwithout a doubt an appropriate placement for Nicholas (the facts confirm\nhis improvement at that school),12 and I would thus hold that the Clyneses\nare entitled to reimbursement for the summer of 1991 and the 1991-92 school\nyear. Furthermore, because the district did not prepare the 1992-93 IEP\nuntil after the Clyneses had contractually committed to send Nicholas to\nChurchill for that term, I would also approve reimbursement for the 1992-93\nschool year.     To the extent the majority has decided otherwise, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\nA true copy:\n\n      Attest:\n\n             CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n      12\n         Having determined that Fort Zumwalt did offer Nicholas a free appropriate\npublic education, the majority has apparently found it unnecessary to evaluate the\npropriety of placement at the Churchill School. The Court does, though, mention\nIDEA's mainstreaming requirement. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(5) (1994). I would hold\nthat the preference for mainstreaming is honored where parents send their child to an\nacademy, such as the Churchill School, which employs a curriculum designed to\nprepare the student for a return to a regular classroom environment.\n\n                                        -20-\n\f</pre>",
