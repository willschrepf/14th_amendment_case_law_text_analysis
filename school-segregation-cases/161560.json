The Plaintiffs, four not-for-profit membership corporations that provide services to\n\ncommunity action agencies receiving Head Start grants, filed suit alleging the so-called Designation\n\nRenewal System is unconstitutional and violates the Administrative Procedures Act. The Court\n\nrejected the Plaintiffs’ challenges, and entered final judgment in favor of the Defendants on July 9,\n\n2012. Nearly two months after the entry of final judgment and one month after filing their notice of\n\nappeal, the Plaintiffs now ask the Court to bar HHS from implementing the Designation Renewal\n\nSystem while Plaintiffs’ appeal is pending.

Opin.,\n\nECF No. [30], at 2-9. In short, Head Start is a national program that provides health, educational,\n\nnutritional, and other services to children of low income families in order to promote school\n\nreadiness. Admin. Record (“A.R.”) 03326 (DRS Final Rule). In some locations, umbrella agencies\n\nreceive Head Start grants, but delegate the provision of actual services to member agencies. A.R.\n\n00284 (Oct. 2008 Advisory Comm. Report). In this case, the members of the Plaintiff organizations,\n\nknown as community action agencies, receive grants directly from the Head Start program. Am.\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 2-5. Regardless of the grant structure, the agency responsible for directly providing\n\nservices is known as a “Head Start agency.” A.R. 03345 (DRS Final Rule). In order to monitor the\n\nquality of services provided by grantees and delegate agencies, the Head Start program conducts\n\nfour types of reviews (1) reviews of newly designated Head Start agencies following the first year of\n\nproviding services; (2) triennial reviews, evaluating each Head Start agency at least once during a\n\nthree year period; (3) follow-up reviews of Head Start agencies found to have at least one deficiency\n\nor significant areas of non-compliance; and (4) unannounced on-site visits. 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(c)(1);\n\nsee also 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(c)(2) (detailing the composition of review teams and areas of\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          Because the Court finds the balance of the equities weigh heavily against granting the\nrequested injunction, the Court does not reach the Defendants’ claim that the scope of the requested\ninjunction is overly broad. Defs.’ Opp’n at 15.\n\n                                                 2\n\fassessment). On-site reviews may lead to identification of two types of violations: deficiencies and\n\nnon-compliances. A deficiency is defined as\n\n       (A)     A systemic or substantial material failure of an agency in an area of\n               performance that the Secretary determines involves-\n\n               (i)     a threat to the health, safety, or civil rights of children or staff;\n\n               (ii)    a denial to parents of the exercise of their full roles and\n                       responsibilities related to program operations;\n\n               (iii)   a failure to comply with standards related to early childhood\n                       development and health services, family and community partnerships,\n                       or program design and management;\n\n               (iv)    the misuse of funds received under this subchapter;\n\n               (v)     loss of legal status (as determined by the Secretary) or financial\n                       viability, loss of permits, debarment from receiving Federal grants or\n                       contracts, or the improper use of federal funds; or\n\n               (vi)    failure to meet any other Federal or State requirement that the agency\n                       has shown an unwillingness or inability to correct, after notice from\n                       the Secretary, within the period specified;\n\n       (B)     systemic or material failure of the governing body of an agency to fully\n               exercise its legal and fiduciary responsibilities; or\n\n       (C)     an unresolved area of noncompliance.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9832(2). If a Head Start agency is found to violate “Federal or State requirements . . .\n\nin ways that do not constitute a deficiency,” the agency will be labeled as “non-compliant.” 45\n\nC.F.R. § 1304.61(a). The Secretary “will notify the grantee promptly, in writing, of the finding,\n\nidentifying the area or areas of noncompliance to be corrected and specifying the period in which\n\nthey must be corrected.” Id. A non-compliance will be re-classified as a deficiency if the grantee\n\nfails “to correct the specified areas of noncompliance within the prescribed time period.” Id. §\n\n1304.61(b).\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f       As part of the various types of program reviews set forth in the statute, teams of monitors\n\nperform on-site inspections evaluating each Head Start agency’s compliance with “program,\n\nadministrative, financial management, and other requirements.” 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(c)(1); A.R.\n\n03331 (DRS Final Rule). If issues are identified on-site, the monitoring team will speak to agency\n\npersonnel during the process of the review. A.R. 03332; e.g., A.R. 01604 (“[T]he Site Director at\n\nthe [Head Start agency] confirmed the metal screws protruding from the fenceposts posed a safety\n\nhazard.”). The review team submits evaluation materials to HHS, and experts from the Office of\n\nHead Start and ACF determine if the agency is non-compliant or deficient. A.R. 03332. “The Act\n\ndoes not provide for an appeal of deficiency findings.” Id. However,\n\n       [G]rantees currently have the opportunity to discuss the progress of the monitoring\n       review while the review team is on site. Although the final determination is not\n       made during the on-site review, grantees consistently are informed of the opportunity\n       to provide additional input when concerns are identified while the team is on-site.\n\nId. If an agency fails to correct the deficiency within the relevant time frame, HHS will issue a letter\n\nof termination, which may be appealed to the Departmental Appeals Board. Id. § 9836a(e)(1)(C);\n\nA.R. 03331.\n\n       Historically, Head Start grants were issued for a single year but automatically renewed each\n\nyear until the grantee relinquished the grant or HHS terminated the grant. A.R. 00001 (Proposed\n\nDRS Rule). The Government Accountability Office issued a report in 2005 criticizing this practice,\n\nfinding that “[w]hen grants are allowed to remain with poorly performing grantees, children being\n\nserved may not be getting the ‘head start’ they deserve because the grantees continuously fail to\n\nmeet program and financial management standards.” Id. As part of the Improving Head Start for\n\nSchool Readiness Act of 2007, Congress instructed the Defendants in this action, the United States\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of HHS\n\n                                                   4\n\f(collectively, “Defendants” or “the Secretary”), to promulgate regulations requiring low-performing\n\ngrantees to compete for five-year grants, rather than receive automatic renewal of their grants under\n\nthe Head Start program. 42 U.S.C. § 9836(c)(1). The resulting Designation Renewal System\n\nrequires recipients of Head Start grants to compete for new five-year grants if, among other things,\n\nthe grantees received one or more “deficiency” findings during the relevant time period.3 Plaintiffs\n\nfiled suit against HHS and Secretary Sebelius in her official capacity, alleging that the so-called\n\n“single deficiency trigger” is invalid because it (1) is impermissibly retroactive; (2) deprives\n\nPlaintiffs of protected property and liberty interests without due process; and (3) is arbitrary and\n\ncapricious. Am. Compl., ECF No. [8], ¶¶ 71-79. The Court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nthe Defendants on all claims on July 9, 2012. See generally 7/9/12 Mem. Opin., ECF No. [30]. The\n\nPlaintiffs now ask the Court to enjoin the awarding of new grants in geographic areas covered by\n\nPlaintiffs’ member agencies pursuant to the DRS.\n\n                                     II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       In evaluating the Plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction pending appeal, the Court evaluates four\n\nfactors: (1) the Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits of their appeal; (2) any irreparable\n\nharm to the Plaintiffs absent a stay; (3) whether issuing a stay would substantially harm the other\n\ninterested parties; and (4) the public’s interest. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          In addition to the single deficiency trigger, the final rule requires a Head Start agency to\ncompete for a new grant if the agency (1) fails to establish appropriate program goals; (2) fails to\ntake specified steps to achieve “school readiness goals”; (3) receives classroom observation scores\nbelow a certain threshold; (4) has its state or local operating licenses revoked; (5) is suspended from\nthe Head Start or Early Head Start program by ACF; (6) is barred from receiving state or federal\nfunds; or (7) is at risk of failing to function as a going concern at any point in the twelve months\nprior to designation under the DRS. A.R. 3346 (DRS Final Rule, 45 C.F.R. § 1307.3(b)-(g)).\n\n                                                  5\n\fTours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1977). These factors “have typically been evaluated on a\n\nsliding scale.” Davis v. Pension Ben. Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1291 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\n                                         III. DISCUSSION\n\n       A.      Plaintiffs Fail to Show a Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n\n       The Plaintiffs contend they are likely to succeed with their appeal because the Court erred in\n\nthree ways: (1) finding the Plaintiffs did not have a protected property interest in automatic renewal\n\nof their grants; (2) finding HHS provided sufficient due process before depriving the Plaintiffs of\n\ntheir protected property interest; and (3) finding Congress did not expressly preclude the Defendants\n\nfrom promulgating a single-deficiency trigger as part of the DRS. None of these arguments are\n\npersuasive.\n\n               1.      Plaintiffs’ Due Process Claim\n\n       Initially, the Plaintiff contends the Court erred in finding the language of the Reauthorization\n\ndid not create a sufficient substantive predicate to create a protected interest in automatic renewal of\n\ntheir Head Start Grants. The Plaintiffs cite Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983), for the proposition\n\nthat “broadly or generally worded laws and rules can comprise sufficient ‘substantive predicates’ for\n\nthe purposes of determining the existence or absence of a property interest.” Pls.’ Mot. at 8. In\n\nHewitt, the Supreme Court concluded that the combination of “unmistakably mandatory character,\n\nrequiring the certain procedures ‘shall,’ ‘will,’ or ‘must’ be employed,” used in conjunction with\n\n“specific substantive predicates”—namely that administrative segregation will not occur absent “the\n\nneed for control” or “the threat of a serious disturbance”—“demands a conclusion that the State has\n\ncreated a protected liberty interest.” 459 U.S. at 472 (quoting 37 PA Code § 95.103(b)(3)).\n\n       The language in the Reauthorization Act is far cry from the statute at issue in Hewitt. “High\n\nquality and comprehensive” is not a specific substantive predicate. “High quality” is significantly\n                                                   6\n\fmore vague that “the need for control.” Congress recognized as such when it required the\n\nDefendants to convene an expert panel to provide guidance as to what the term means. For the\n\nreasons stated in the Court’s prior Memorandum Opinion, the Reauthorization Act did not create a\n\nsufficient substantive predicate so as to create a protected property interest in automatic renewal of\n\nHead Start grants.\n\n       The Plaintiffs further contend that the DRS itself sufficiently limited HHS’s discretion so as\n\nto create a protected property interest. The Court notes that the Plaintiffs failed to raise this\n\nargument in their motion for summary judgment. Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. [16-1], at 32-36.\n\nEven if the Court were to accept this argument, the Plaintiffs are still afforded sufficient due\n\nprocess. 7/9/12 Mem. Opin. at 24-29.\n\n       Contrary to the Plaintiffs’ assertion, the Court never concluded that Head Start\n\nagencies/grantees must have an opportunity to challenge HHS’s finding of an underlying DRS\n\ntrigger. Rather, assuming the Plaintiffs are correct that there are inconsistencies or other issues with\n\nthe on-site review process, the Court found the opportunity Head Start agencies are provided is\n\nsufficient due process to avoid any erroneous deprivation that might occur from requiring a grantee\n\nto re-compete. Missing from the Plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction is the proper legal framework\n\nfor evaluating their due process claim: the three-factor balancing test articulated in Mathews v.\n\nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). See 7/9/12 Mem. Opin. at 25-29. On balance, the Plaintiff still fails\n\nto demonstrate that any additional procedures are necessary to satisfy due process.\n\n       Before addressing the relevant factors, the Court notes that the Plaintiffs take issue with what\n\nprocedures are actually provided by HHS before a deficiency finding is issued. Specifically, the\n\nPlaintiffs argue that there is no evidence in the record to indicate that grantees “have an ‘opportunity\n\nto respond’ to an on-site review team’s identification of potential deficiencies.” Pls.’ Mot. at 8. To\n                                                   7\n\fthe contrary, the Administrative Record reflects the fact that on-site review teams discuss potential\n\nissues with responsible officials at the relevant Head Start agency before any deficiency finding is\n\nmade. E.g., A.R. 1604 (“The Health Content Expert/Health Coordinator at Community United Head\n\nStart and Day Care, Inc., and the Site Director at the Mather Early Learning Center confirmed the\n\nmetal screws protruding from the fenceposts posed a safety hazard.”); id. (“An observation at the\n\nOakfield Child Enrichment Center found an unlabeled inhaler with no child’s name or prescription\n\ndirectives in an unlocked first aid kit. The Director, Administrator, and teacher confirmed the\n\nmedication was not in a locked box and was not labeled with prescription directives.”). The\n\nPlaintiffs fail to point to any evidence to refute the fact that “grantees consistently are informed of\n\nthe opportunity to provide additional input when concerns are identified while the team is onsite.”\n\nA.R. 3332 (Final Rule, Response to Comment 5). Moreover, the Plaintiffs cite no authority for their\n\nassertion that the Plaintiffs must be provided an opportunity to provide evidence to the agency board\n\nresponsible for making the final deficiency determination. Head Start agencies are notified of issues\n\nidentified while the review team is on-site, and the relevant officials at the Head Start agencies have\n\nan opportunity to provide input, which is transmitted to the relevant decision-making body at HHS.\n\nE.g., A.R. 1604 (citing interviews with relevant Head Start Agency personnel by the on-site review\n\nteam as part of the deficiency finding). Plaintiffs have not argued that the on-site review teams do\n\nnot accurately transmit information provided by Head Start agencies to the final decision makers or\n\notherwise shown that due process further requires an opportunity to present additional information\n\ndirectly to the HHS officials making the final deficiency determination. The Head Start agencies are\n\nplaced on notice by the on-site review teams that an issue may lead to a non-compliance or\n\ndeficiency finding, and relevant officials from the Head Start agencies have an opportunity to\n\nrespond.\n                                                  8\n\f       In terms of the Mathews factors, the degree of potential deprivation is still slight: erroneous\n\ndeprivation of a grantee’s “right” to automatic renewal at best causes the grantee to expend minimal\n\ntime and effort to apply for a grant for the next cycle. The Plaintiffs contend that “Defendants’\n\ndesignation of grantees as ‘poor performers’ or ‘low performing’ will impair those grantees’ ability\n\nto compete for continued Head Start funding.” Pls.’ Mot. at 10. Assuming for purposes of this\n\nargument that Plaintiffs’ contention is correct—which it is not, see infra at Section III.B.—it only\n\nholds true for grantees that were properly identified as having one or more deficiency findings. If\n\nthe deficiency finding was erroneous, then there is no reason to believe the grantee would be at a\n\ndisadvantage in the re-competition process; the review board evaluating the applications for the\n\ngrants will be able to see the grantee is capable of providing high quality services in the future. In\n\nother words, the cost of requiring competition is minimal, and the risk of terminating grants for\n\nagencies wrongfully labeled as not providing high quality and comprehensive services is slight.\n\n       Second, the existing procedures are fair and reliable. The Plaintiffs take issue with HHS’s\n\nlegal determinations, but not their factual findings; thus there is no reason to believe additional\n\nopportunities to be heard will increase the “fairness” or “reliability” of the on-site review or\n\ndeficiency finding process. The Plaintiffs simply quote their own assertions from their initial\n\nmotion, and simply ignore the Court’s thorough analysis of the deficiency findings in the record.\n\n7/9/12 Mem. Opin. at 27-28. The Plaintiffs re-assert their position that the deficiency finding\n\nagainst the Child Development Council of Franklin County was in error. Pls.’ Mot. at 13. However,\n\non the present record, the Court cannot find that HHS was unwarranted in issuing a deficiency\n\nfinding after a grantee spent in excess of $41,000 on gift cards for employee Christmas gifts. Decl.\n\nof M. James, ECF No. [16-12], ¶ 23. The fact that the Child Development Council’s internal\n\nguidelines purportedly authorized the expenditure does not make this use of Head Start funds in this\n                                                  9\n\fmanner any less egregious. To the extent the deficiency finding against the Community Action\n\nCommission of Fayette County was somehow in error, the Plaintiffs fail to explain how any\n\nadditional procedures would have prevented the same outcome. The Declaration submitted from the\n\nagencies Executive Director, Bambi Baugh, reflects the fact that over the course of a year, the\n\nagency worked with HHS personnel to try and resolve the non-compliance/deficiency at issue. Decl.\n\nof B. Baugh, ECF No. [16-8], ¶¶ 15-20. There is nothing in the record to indicate (1) the Plaintiffs\n\nlacked notice and an opportunity to respond before the deficiency finding was issued; or that (2) any\n\nadditional procedures would have changed the result. The Court does not assume that on-site review\n\nteams and HHS officials never make mistakes. But at the same time, Matthews does not require\n\nperfect procedures in order to satisfy due process. To the extent the deficiency finding process is\n\nimperfect, on balance, additional procedures are not warranted.\n\n       Moreover, the Plaintiff offers no authority as to why the Court should ignore the\n\nAdministrative Record in favor of Congressional findings regarding an on-site monitoring system\n\nthat no longer exists. Pls.’ Mot. at 11-12. This is particularly true given the fact that Congress (1)\n\namended the definition of deficiency and the monitoring process; and (2) explicitly required HHS to\n\nconsider on-site review data in designing the DRS system, 42 U.S.C. § 9836(c)(1)(B). The Plaintiffs\n\nalso emphasize that under the new on-site review system in place since the 2007 Reauthorization,\n\nthe number of deficiency findings “more than doubled.” Pls.’ Mot. at 12. The Plaintiffs contend\n\nthat this increase in findings “is inconsistent with a conclusion” that the Defendants are properly\n\nimplementing the deficiency definition as modified by the 2007 Reauthorization. The increase in\n\ndeficiency findings could just as easily be read to reflect that HHS is more consistently identifying\n\nsystemic or substantial material failures across Head Start grantees, or that in light of economic\n\nconditions between 2008 and 2010, grantees were less able to correct issues that were identified as\n                                                 10\n\fdeficiencies by on-site teams. In other words, without more, the Court cannot draw the conclusion\n\nthe Plaintiffs urge from that statistic.\n\n        Notably, in their motion for an injunction, the Plaintiffs never address the third Mathews\n\nfactor---the administrative burden and other societal costs that would accompany the additional\n\nproposed safeguards. 7/9/12 Mem. Opin. at 28. To the extent the Plaintiffs have identified any\n\nincorrect deficiency finding, the Plaintiffs have never argued that an additional hearing before the\n\nHHS officials would have led to a different outcome. On balance, the risk and cost of erroneous\n\ndeprivation is slim, the current procedures are overall fair and reliable, and the administrative costs\n\nof increased procedures outweigh what little fairness might be gained by additional procedural\n\nprotections. Accordingly, the Court finds once again that the Plaintiffs have minimal likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits of their due process claim.\n\n                2.      Plaintiffs’ Administrative Procedures Act Claim\n\n        The Plaintiffs also claim they are likely to succeed on the merits of their Administrative\n\nProcedures Act claim upon appeal. In reference to the Court’s Chevron analysis, the Plaintiffs\n\nattempt to revive an argument that was first raised in their reply brief, but remains unpersuasive.\n\nThe Court need not waste its and the parties’ time repeating the entirety of its prior analysis. 7/9/12\n\nMem. Opin. at 29-40. In short, the Plaintiffs contend that the Court should have found that, under\n\nthe first step of Chevron, the statute was ambiguous as to the Secretary’s authority to promulgate a\n\nsingle-deficiency trigger as part of the final DRS. As an initial matter, the Plaintiffs offer no\n\nauthority to support their claim that when a statute unambiguously grants discretion to the\n\nDefendants to promulgate certain rules, that the content of those rules is later reviewed under the\n\nfirst step of Chevron as opposed to the second step of Chevron. Even if the Court were to undertake\n\nthis analysis, the Plaintiffs fail to articulate how the statute itself is ambiguous as to the single-\n                                                  11\n\fdeficiency trigger. The Plaintiffs in essence look to the legislative history in order to create\n\nambiguity in an otherwise clear statute. Assuming arguendo that the statute was ambiguous on this\n\nfront, the problem with the Plaintiffs’ argument is that the legislative history does not indicate that\n\n“Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural\n\nRes. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984). To the contrary, the House Committee Report\n\nexplicitly left open the possibility that the Secretary could enact a single deficiency trigger:\n\n       The Committee includes the triennial review as part of this system because this\n       extensive review generally contains a wealth of information. However, the\n       Committee strongly encourages the expert panel and the Secretary to use this\n       information more thoughtfully than simply tabulating whether a grantee has been\n       deemed deficient or not.\n\nH.R. Rep. 110-67, at 61 (2007). The Plaintiffs’ argument would require the Court to find that strong\n\nencouragement from a Committee is equivalent to explicitly barring HHS from taking a specific\n\ncourse of action. The Plaintiffs cite Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner, 357 U.S. 28 (1958) for the\n\nproposition that “Courts have found similar explanatory statements in committee reports to be\n\n‘persuasive indications’ of Congress’s wishes in vacating agency interpretations of law that run\n\ncontrary to those wishes.” Pls.’ Mot. at 17. However, Colony pre-dated Chevron, and the legislative\n\nhistory was but one of several reasons the Court rejected the Tax Commissioner’s interpretation of\n\nthe statute. The Plaintiffs did not cite a single case in which “encouragement” from Congress in the\n\nlegislative history, absent more, was accepted as a direct and controlling statement from Congress\n\nfor Chevron purposes that invalidates an agency interpretation that declined to follow Congress’\n\nrecommendation. The Court cannot overlook the fact the Committee recommended against a\n\nparticular course of action as opposed to prohibiting it. Therefore, the Court finds the Plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to show a likelihood of success on their Administrative Procedures Claim on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f       The Court cannot say that the Plaintiffs’ have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits. CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 746 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1995). On this basis alone, the Court could dispose of the Plaintiffs’ motion. See Apotex, Inc. v.\n\nFood & Drug Admin., 449 F.3d 1249, 1253-54 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Nevertheless, the Court shall\n\nbriefly address the other factors relevant to the Plaintiffs’ request.\n\n       B.      Plaintiffs Will Not Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent an Injunction Pending Appeal\n\n       The Plaintiffs contend that their member agencies will suffer irreparable harm if the DRS\n\ngoes into effect pending resolution of the Plaintiffs’ appeal because HHS “ha[s] structured the DRS\n\nin a manner that virtually guarantees that grantees required to recompete will lose their designation\n\nas Head Start agencies.” Pls.’ Mot. at 18. The Court explained at length in its prior opinion why\n\nthis argument is faulty: in short, the Plaintiffs’ argument conflates two different standards in two\n\nseparate sections of the statute. 7/9/12 Mem. Opin. at 23-24 (comparing 42 U.S.C. § 9836(c)\n\n(regarding the requirements for the DRS) with 42 U.S.C. § 9836(d)(3) (indicating preference should\n\nbe given to certain applications in areas in which no grantee receives automatic renewal)).\n\nMoreover, as the Defendants note, participation in the competition process is triggered by the\n\ngrantees’ past deficiencies, the results of the competition process are based on the applicant’s\n\nprospective ability to provide services, and the Plaintiffs emphasize that their member agencies have\n\ncorrected any previously identified deficiencies. There is nothing in the record to support the\n\ncontention that it is “virtually guaranteed” that grantees forced to re-compete will not receive new\n\ngrants on the basis of the designation to re-compete in and of itself.4\n\n\n       4\n         To the extent grantees forced to re-compete actually provide lower-quality services than\nothers competing for grants, then the grantees may not receive new grants as part of DRS\ncompetition process. Defs.’ Opp’n at 6-7. It is the quality of the services the applicant can provide,\nnot designation under the DRS itself, that is outcome determinative.\n                                                  13\n\f        The Plaintiffs further contend that “the adverse business consequences of placement on the\n\nRecompete List for the Plaintiffs’ members will intensify in the months to come if the Court does\n\nnot enjoin the competition process pending resolution of the appeal.” Pls.’ Mot. at 21. However, the\n\nPlaintiffs fail to cite any examples of contracts, funding, or other “business consequences” that\n\nmight occur in the coming months, apart from the termination of the grants if member agencies are\n\nnot selected. The Plaintiffs’ member agencies were notified in early 2012 that they would be forced\n\nto re-compete, and the final round of applications closed in August 2012. The Plaintiffs provide no\n\nexplanation as to why now, eight months after the member agencies were designated for\n\ncompetition, unspecified “business consequences” will “intensify,” or the member agencies’ “ability\n\nto attract and retain staff” will be further impaired. Id. Moreover, the Plaintiffs fail to explain why\n\nany of these effects are irreparable. At best, the Plaintiffs have “only vaguely sketch[ed] the\n\ncontours” of the asserted harms. Cuomo v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory. Comm’n, 772 F.2d 972, 976\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1985). The Plaintiffs’ motion falls far short of showing that the injuries they face are\n\n“both certain and great.” Id. (citations omitted). Therefore, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs’ face a\n\nminor risk of irreparable injury absent an injunction pending appeal.\n\n        C.      Risk of Substantial Harm to Other Interested Parties\n\n        The Plaintiffs assert that “the adverse impact of an injunction on HHS would be\n\ninsubstantial.” Pls.’ Mot. at 21. Staying the DRS pending appeal would amount to more than\n\nsimply pressing the pause button on the re-competition process. If the Court of Appeals upholds the\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of the Defendants, the delay will have made the information in\n\nthe grant applications stale, requiring a new round of applications and review before grants can be\n\nfinally awarded. Decl. of S. Pinckney, ECF No. [34-1], ¶¶ 10-11. The delay would ultimately\n\nrequire the expenditure of significant resources and further delay in naming grantees and service\n                                                   14\n\fproviders. Id. Even if the injunction was limited to only those geographic areas covered by\n\nPlaintiffs’ member agencies that are subject to re-competition, this would still amount to re-doing\n\nthe entire grant application and review process for over 10% of the geographic areas receiving Head\n\nStart grants subject to competition. Id. at ¶ 9. Weighed against the potential irreparable injury\n\narticulated by the Plaintiffs, the Court finds the substantial risk of harm to other interested parties\n\noutweighs the risk of harm to the Plaintiffs. As such, the balance of harms favors denying the\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion.5\n\n        D.      Public Interest\n\n        As in most cases, the public interest is essentially a wash. The public has a vested interest in\n\nensuring that Federal Agencies enforce laws enacted by Congress. In other words, the final factor\n\nfavors whatever party prevails on appeal. Serono Labs., Inc. v. Shalala, 158 F.3d 1313, 1326 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1998) (noting that “the public interest, also offers [Plaintiff] no support because it is inextricably\n\nlinked with the merits of the case”). Additionally, the public has a vested interest in ensuring that\n\nHead Start agencies are providing high quality services, including a safe environment for the\n\nchildren receiving services. Insofar as the Plaintiffs’ member agencies have been cited for\n\ndeficiencies regarding safety violations, implementation of the DRS will provide HHS the\n\nopportunity to evaluate these agencies’ capacities for providing a safe environment in the future. In\n\nthis respect, the public has a vested interest in permitting the re-competition process to move\n\nforward. Thus, the public interest weighs in favor of denying the requested injunctions.\n\n\n        5\n           It is also worth noting that enjoining the DRS would delay providing grants to agencies\n(other than those represented by the Plaintiffs) that would receive grants as part of the DRS\ncompetition. Thus to the extent the lack of an injunction impairs the business interests of the\nPlaintiffs, that injury is counterbalanced by the injury to other grantees whose funds will be delayed\nby the injunction. See Serono Labs., Inc. v. Shalala, 158 F.3d 1313, 1326 (D.C. Cir. 1998).\n\n                                                    15\n\f                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds Plaintiffs failed to establish that an injunction\n\npending appeal is warranted. The Plaintiffs failed to show any likelihood of success on the merits,\n\nwhich weighs heavily against granting the Plaintiffs’ motion. The Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate\n\nthey will suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction. Conversely, the Defendants would have to\n\nexpend significant resources if the competition process was enjoined, and the injunction would\n\nsignificantly delay naming new grantees to provide Head Start services. Ultimately, the public\n\ninterest weighs against an injunction. On balance, the Court finds the equities do not weigh in favor\n\nof enjoining implementation of the DRS pending resolution of the Plaintiffs’ appeal. Accordingly,\n\nPlaintiffs’ [33] Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal is DENIED.\n\n       An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n                                                         /s/\n                                                      COLLEEN KOLLAR-KOTELLY\n                                                      UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f",

Opin.,\n\nECF No. [30], at 2-9. In short, Head Start is a national program that provides health, educational,\n\nnutritional, and other services to children of low income families in order to promote school\n\nreadiness. Admin. Record (“A.R.”) 03326 (DRS Final Rule). In some locations, umbrella agencies\n\nreceive Head Start grants, but delegate the provision of actual services to member agencies. A.R.\n\n00284 (Oct. 2008 Advisory Comm. Report). In this case, the members of the Plaintiff organizations,\n\nknown as community action agencies, receive grants directly from the Head Start program. Am.\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 2-5. Regardless of the grant structure, the agency responsible for directly providing\n\nservices is known as a “Head Start agency.” A.R. 03345 (DRS Final Rule). In order to monitor the\n\nquality of services provided by grantees and delegate agencies, the Head Start program conducts\n\nfour types of reviews (1) reviews of newly designated Head Start agencies following the first year of\n\nproviding services; (2) triennial reviews, evaluating each Head Start agency at least once during a\n\nthree year period; (3) follow-up reviews of Head Start agencies found to have at least one deficiency\n\nor significant areas of non-compliance; and (4) unannounced on-site visits. 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(c)(1);\n\nsee also 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(c)(2) (detailing the composition of review teams and areas of\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          Because the Court finds the balance of the equities weigh heavily against granting the\nrequested injunction, the Court does not reach the Defendants’ claim that the scope of the requested\ninjunction is overly broad. Defs.’ Opp’n at 15.\n\n                                                 2\n\fassessment). On-site reviews may lead to identification of two types of violations: deficiencies and\n\nnon-compliances. A deficiency is defined as\n\n       (A)     A systemic or substantial material failure of an agency in an area of\n               performance that the Secretary determines involves-\n\n               (i)     a threat to the health, safety, or civil rights of children or staff;\n\n               (ii)    a denial to parents of the exercise of their full roles and\n                       responsibilities related to program operations;\n\n               (iii)   a failure to comply with standards related to early childhood\n                       development and health services, family and community partnerships,\n                       or program design and management;\n\n               (iv)    the misuse of funds received under this subchapter;\n\n               (v)     loss of legal status (as determined by the Secretary) or financial\n                       viability, loss of permits, debarment from receiving Federal grants or\n                       contracts, or the improper use of federal funds; or\n\n               (vi)    failure to meet any other Federal or State requirement that the agency\n                       has shown an unwillingness or inability to correct, after notice from\n                       the Secretary, within the period specified;\n\n       (B)     systemic or material failure of the governing body of an agency to fully\n               exercise its legal and fiduciary responsibilities; or\n\n       (C)     an unresolved area of noncompliance.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9832(2). If a Head Start agency is found to violate “Federal or State requirements . . .\n\nin ways that do not constitute a deficiency,” the agency will be labeled as “non-compliant.” 45\n\nC.F.R. § 1304.61(a). The Secretary “will notify the grantee promptly, in writing, of the finding,\n\nidentifying the area or areas of noncompliance to be corrected and specifying the period in which\n\nthey must be corrected.” Id. A non-compliance will be re-classified as a deficiency if the grantee\n\nfails “to correct the specified areas of noncompliance within the prescribed time period.” Id. §\n\n1304.61(b).\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f       As part of the various types of program reviews set forth in the statute, teams of monitors\n\nperform on-site inspections evaluating each Head Start agency’s compliance with “program,\n\nadministrative, financial management, and other requirements.” 42 U.S.C. § 9836a(c)(1); A.R.\n\n03331 (DRS Final Rule). If issues are identified on-site, the monitoring team will speak to agency\n\npersonnel during the process of the review. A.R. 03332; e.g., A.R. 01604 (“[T]he Site Director at\n\nthe [Head Start agency] confirmed the metal screws protruding from the fenceposts posed a safety\n\nhazard.”). The review team submits evaluation materials to HHS, and experts from the Office of\n\nHead Start and ACF determine if the agency is non-compliant or deficient. A.R. 03332. “The Act\n\ndoes not provide for an appeal of deficiency findings.” Id. However,\n\n       [G]rantees currently have the opportunity to discuss the progress of the monitoring\n       review while the review team is on site. Although the final determination is not\n       made during the on-site review, grantees consistently are informed of the opportunity\n       to provide additional input when concerns are identified while the team is on-site.\n\nId. If an agency fails to correct the deficiency within the relevant time frame, HHS will issue a letter\n\nof termination, which may be appealed to the Departmental Appeals Board. Id. § 9836a(e)(1)(C);\n\nA.R. 03331.\n\n       Historically, Head Start grants were issued for a single year but automatically renewed each\n\nyear until the grantee relinquished the grant or HHS terminated the grant. A.R. 00001 (Proposed\n\nDRS Rule). The Government Accountability Office issued a report in 2005 criticizing this practice,\n\nfinding that “[w]hen grants are allowed to remain with poorly performing grantees, children being\n\nserved may not be getting the ‘head start’ they deserve because the grantees continuously fail to\n\nmeet program and financial management standards.” Id. As part of the Improving Head Start for\n\nSchool Readiness Act of 2007, Congress instructed the Defendants in this action, the United States\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of HHS\n\n                                                   4\n\f(collectively, “Defendants” or “the Secretary”), to promulgate regulations requiring low-performing\n\ngrantees to compete for five-year grants, rather than receive automatic renewal of their grants under\n\nthe Head Start program. 42 U.S.C. § 9836(c)(1). The resulting Designation Renewal System\n\nrequires recipients of Head Start grants to compete for new five-year grants if, among other things,\n\nthe grantees received one or more “deficiency” findings during the relevant time period.3 Plaintiffs\n\nfiled suit against HHS and Secretary Sebelius in her official capacity, alleging that the so-called\n\n“single deficiency trigger” is invalid because it (1) is impermissibly retroactive; (2) deprives\n\nPlaintiffs of protected property and liberty interests without due process; and (3) is arbitrary and\n\ncapricious. Am. Compl., ECF No. [8], ¶¶ 71-79. The Court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nthe Defendants on all claims on July 9, 2012. See generally 7/9/12 Mem. Opin., ECF No. [30]. The\n\nPlaintiffs now ask the Court to enjoin the awarding of new grants in geographic areas covered by\n\nPlaintiffs’ member agencies pursuant to the DRS.\n\n                                     II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       In evaluating the Plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction pending appeal, the Court evaluates four\n\nfactors: (1) the Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits of their appeal; (2) any irreparable\n\nharm to the Plaintiffs absent a stay; (3) whether issuing a stay would substantially harm the other\n\ninterested parties; and (4) the public’s interest. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          In addition to the single deficiency trigger, the final rule requires a Head Start agency to\ncompete for a new grant if the agency (1) fails to establish appropriate program goals; (2) fails to\ntake specified steps to achieve “school readiness goals”; (3) receives classroom observation scores\nbelow a certain threshold; (4) has its state or local operating licenses revoked; (5) is suspended from\nthe Head Start or Early Head Start program by ACF; (6) is barred from receiving state or federal\nfunds; or (7) is at risk of failing to function as a going concern at any point in the twelve months\nprior to designation under the DRS.

Plaintiffs Fail to Show a Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n\n       The Plaintiffs contend they are likely to succeed with their appeal because the Court erred in\n\nthree ways: (1) finding the Plaintiffs did not have a protected property interest in automatic renewal\n\nof their grants; (2) finding HHS provided sufficient due process before depriving the Plaintiffs of\n\ntheir protected property interest; and (3) finding Congress did not expressly preclude the Defendants\n\nfrom promulgating a single-deficiency trigger as part of the DRS. None of these arguments are\n\npersuasive.\n\n               1.      Plaintiffs’ Due Process Claim\n\n       Initially, the Plaintiff contends the Court erred in finding the language of the Reauthorization\n\ndid not create a sufficient substantive predicate to create a protected interest in automatic renewal of\n\ntheir Head Start Grants. The Plaintiffs cite Hewitt v. Helms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983), for the proposition\n\nthat “broadly or generally worded laws and rules can comprise sufficient ‘substantive predicates’ for\n\nthe purposes of determining the existence or absence of a property interest.” Pls.’ Mot. at 8. In\n\nHewitt, the Supreme Court concluded that the combination of “unmistakably mandatory character,\n\nrequiring the certain procedures ‘shall,’ ‘will,’ or ‘must’ be employed,” used in conjunction with\n\n“specific substantive predicates”—namely that administrative segregation will not occur absent “the\n\nneed for control” or “the threat of a serious disturbance”—“demands a conclusion that the State has\n\ncreated a protected liberty interest.” 459 U.S. at 472 (quoting 37 PA Code § 95.103(b)(3)).\n\n       The language in the Reauthorization Act is far cry from the statute at issue in Hewitt. “High\n\nquality and comprehensive” is not a specific substantive predicate. “High quality” is significantly\n                                                   6\n\fmore vague that “the need for control.” Congress recognized as such when it required the\n\nDefendants to convene an expert panel to provide guidance as to what the term means. For the\n\nreasons stated in the Court’s prior Memorandum Opinion, the Reauthorization Act did not create a\n\nsufficient substantive predicate so as to create a protected property interest in automatic renewal of\n\nHead Start grants.\n\n       The Plaintiffs further contend that the DRS itself sufficiently limited HHS’s discretion so as\n\nto create a protected property interest. The Court notes that the Plaintiffs failed to raise this\n\nargument in their motion for summary judgment. Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. [16-1], at 32-36.\n\nEven if the Court were to accept this argument, the Plaintiffs are still afforded sufficient due\n\nprocess. 7/9/12 Mem. Opin. at 24-29.\n\n       Contrary to the Plaintiffs’ assertion, the Court never concluded that Head Start\n\nagencies/grantees must have an opportunity to challenge HHS’s finding of an underlying DRS\n\ntrigger. Rather, assuming the Plaintiffs are correct that there are inconsistencies or other issues with\n\nthe on-site review process, the Court found the opportunity Head Start agencies are provided is\n\nsufficient due process to avoid any erroneous deprivation that might occur from requiring a grantee\n\nto re-compete. Missing from the Plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction is the proper legal framework\n\nfor evaluating their due process claim: the three-factor balancing test articulated in Mathews v.\n\nEldridge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976). See 7/9/12 Mem. Opin. at 25-29. On balance, the Plaintiff still fails\n\nto demonstrate that any additional procedures are necessary to satisfy due process.\n\n       Before addressing the relevant factors, the Court notes that the Plaintiffs take issue with what\n\nprocedures are actually provided by HHS before a deficiency finding is issued. Specifically, the\n\nPlaintiffs argue that there is no evidence in the record to indicate that grantees “have an ‘opportunity\n\nto respond’ to an on-site review team’s identification of potential deficiencies.” Pls.’ Mot. at 8. To\n                                                   7\n\fthe contrary, the Administrative Record reflects the fact that on-site review teams discuss potential\n\nissues with responsible officials at the relevant Head Start agency before any deficiency finding is\n\nmade. E.g., A.R. 1604 (“The Health Content Expert/Health Coordinator at Community United Head\n\nStart and Day Care, Inc., and the Site Director at the Mather Early Learning Center confirmed the\n\nmetal screws protruding from the fenceposts posed a safety hazard.”); id. (“An observation at the\n\nOakfield Child Enrichment Center found an unlabeled inhaler with no child’s name or prescription\n\ndirectives in an unlocked first aid kit. The Director, Administrator, and teacher confirmed the\n\nmedication was not in a locked box and was not labeled with prescription directives.”). The\n\nPlaintiffs fail to point to any evidence to refute the fact that “grantees consistently are informed of\n\nthe opportunity to provide additional input when concerns are identified while the team is onsite.”\n\nA.R. 3332 (Final Rule, Response to Comment 5). Moreover, the Plaintiffs cite no authority for their\n\nassertion that the Plaintiffs must be provided an opportunity to provide evidence to the agency board\n\nresponsible for making the final deficiency determination. Head Start agencies are notified of issues\n\nidentified while the review team is on-site, and the relevant officials at the Head Start agencies have\n\nan opportunity to provide input, which is transmitted to the relevant decision-making body at HHS.\n\nE.g., A.R. 1604 (citing interviews with relevant Head Start Agency personnel by the on-site review\n\nteam as part of the deficiency finding). Plaintiffs have not argued that the on-site review teams do\n\nnot accurately transmit information provided by Head Start agencies to the final decision makers or\n\notherwise shown that due process further requires an opportunity to present additional information\n\ndirectly to the HHS officials making the final deficiency determination. The Head Start agencies are\n\nplaced on notice by the on-site review teams that an issue may lead to a non-compliance or\n\ndeficiency finding, and relevant officials from the Head Start agencies have an opportunity to\n\nrespond.\n                                                  8\n\f       In terms of the Mathews factors, the degree of potential deprivation is still slight: erroneous\n\ndeprivation of a grantee’s “right” to automatic renewal at best causes the grantee to expend minimal\n\ntime and effort to apply for a grant for the next cycle. The Plaintiffs contend that “Defendants’\n\ndesignation of grantees as ‘poor performers’ or ‘low performing’ will impair those grantees’ ability\n\nto compete for continued Head Start funding.” Pls.’ Mot. at 10. Assuming for purposes of this\n\nargument that Plaintiffs’ contention is correct—which it is not, see infra at Section III.B.—it only\n\nholds true for grantees that were properly identified as having one or more deficiency findings. If\n\nthe deficiency finding was erroneous, then there is no reason to believe the grantee would be at a\n\ndisadvantage in the re-competition process; the review board evaluating the applications for the\n\ngrants will be able to see the grantee is capable of providing high quality services in the future. In\n\nother words, the cost of requiring competition is minimal, and the risk of terminating grants for\n\nagencies wrongfully labeled as not providing high quality and comprehensive services is slight.\n\n       Second, the existing procedures are fair and reliable. The Plaintiffs take issue with HHS’s\n\nlegal determinations, but not their factual findings; thus there is no reason to believe additional\n\nopportunities to be heard will increase the “fairness” or “reliability” of the on-site review or\n\ndeficiency finding process. The Plaintiffs simply quote their own assertions from their initial\n\nmotion, and simply ignore the Court’s thorough analysis of the deficiency findings in the record.\n\n7/9/12 Mem. Opin. at 27-28. The Plaintiffs re-assert their position that the deficiency finding\n\nagainst the Child Development Council of Franklin County was in error. Pls.’ Mot. at 13. However,\n\non the present record, the Court cannot find that HHS was unwarranted in issuing a deficiency\n\nfinding after a grantee spent in excess of $41,000 on gift cards for employee Christmas gifts. Decl.\n\nof M. James, ECF No. [16-12], ¶ 23. The fact that the Child Development Council’s internal\n\nguidelines purportedly authorized the expenditure does not make this use of Head Start funds in this\n                                                  9\n\fmanner any less egregious. To the extent the deficiency finding against the Community Action\n\nCommission of Fayette County was somehow in error, the Plaintiffs fail to explain how any\n\nadditional procedures would have prevented the same outcome. The Declaration submitted from the\n\nagencies Executive Director, Bambi Baugh, reflects the fact that over the course of a year, the\n\nagency worked with HHS personnel to try and resolve the non-compliance/deficiency at issue. Decl.\n\nof B. Baugh, ECF No. [16-8], ¶¶ 15-20. There is nothing in the record to indicate (1) the Plaintiffs\n\nlacked notice and an opportunity to respond before the deficiency finding was issued; or that (2) any\n\nadditional procedures would have changed the result. The Court does not assume that on-site review\n\nteams and HHS officials never make mistakes. But at the same time, Matthews does not require\n\nperfect procedures in order to satisfy due process. To the extent the deficiency finding process is\n\nimperfect, on balance, additional procedures are not warranted.\n\n       Moreover, the Plaintiff offers no authority as to why the Court should ignore the\n\nAdministrative Record in favor of Congressional findings regarding an on-site monitoring system\n\nthat no longer exists. Pls.’ Mot. at 11-12. This is particularly true given the fact that Congress (1)\n\namended the definition of deficiency and the monitoring process; and (2) explicitly required HHS to\n\nconsider on-site review data in designing the DRS system, 42 U.S.C. § 9836(c)(1)(B). The Plaintiffs\n\nalso emphasize that under the new on-site review system in place since the 2007 Reauthorization,\n\nthe number of deficiency findings “more than doubled.” Pls.’ Mot. at 12. The Plaintiffs contend\n\nthat this increase in findings “is inconsistent with a conclusion” that the Defendants are properly\n\nimplementing the deficiency definition as modified by the 2007 Reauthorization. The increase in\n\ndeficiency findings could just as easily be read to reflect that HHS is more consistently identifying\n\nsystemic or substantial material failures across Head Start grantees, or that in light of economic\n\nconditions between 2008 and 2010, grantees were less able to correct issues that were identified as\n                                                 10\n\fdeficiencies by on-site teams. In other words, without more, the Court cannot draw the conclusion\n\nthe Plaintiffs urge from that statistic.\n\n        Notably, in their motion for an injunction, the Plaintiffs never address the third Mathews\n\nfactor---the administrative burden and other societal costs that would accompany the additional\n\nproposed safeguards. 7/9/12 Mem. Opin. at 28. To the extent the Plaintiffs have identified any\n\nincorrect deficiency finding, the Plaintiffs have never argued that an additional hearing before the\n\nHHS officials would have led to a different outcome. On balance, the risk and cost of erroneous\n\ndeprivation is slim, the current procedures are overall fair and reliable, and the administrative costs\n\nof increased procedures outweigh what little fairness might be gained by additional procedural\n\nprotections. Accordingly, the Court finds once again that the Plaintiffs have minimal likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits of their due process claim.\n\n                2.      Plaintiffs’ Administrative Procedures Act Claim\n\n        The Plaintiffs also claim they are likely to succeed on the merits of their Administrative\n\nProcedures Act claim upon appeal. In reference to the Court’s Chevron analysis, the Plaintiffs\n\nattempt to revive an argument that was first raised in their reply brief, but remains unpersuasive.\n\nThe Court need not waste its and the parties’ time repeating the entirety of its prior analysis. 7/9/12\n\nMem. Opin. at 29-40. In short, the Plaintiffs contend that the Court should have found that, under\n\nthe first step of Chevron, the statute was ambiguous as to the Secretary’s authority to promulgate a\n\nsingle-deficiency trigger as part of the final DRS. As an initial matter, the Plaintiffs offer no\n\nauthority to support their claim that when a statute unambiguously grants discretion to the\n\nDefendants to promulgate certain rules, that the content of those rules is later reviewed under the\n\nfirst step of Chevron as opposed to the second step of Chevron. Even if the Court were to undertake\n\nthis analysis, the Plaintiffs fail to articulate how the statute itself is ambiguous as to the single-\n                                                  11\n\fdeficiency trigger. The Plaintiffs in essence look to the legislative history in order to create\n\nambiguity in an otherwise clear statute. Assuming arguendo that the statute was ambiguous on this\n\nfront, the problem with the Plaintiffs’ argument is that the legislative history does not indicate that\n\n“Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural\n\nRes. Def. Council, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 842 (1984). To the contrary, the House Committee Report\n\nexplicitly left open the possibility that the Secretary could enact a single deficiency trigger:\n\n       The Committee includes the triennial review as part of this system because this\n       extensive review generally contains a wealth of information. However, the\n       Committee strongly encourages the expert panel and the Secretary to use this\n       information more thoughtfully than simply tabulating whether a grantee has been\n       deemed deficient or not.\n\nH.R. Rep. 110-67, at 61 (2007). The Plaintiffs’ argument would require the Court to find that strong\n\nencouragement from a Committee is equivalent to explicitly barring HHS from taking a specific\n\ncourse of action. The Plaintiffs cite Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105710\"><a href=\"/opinion/105710/colony-inc-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1958) for the\n\nproposition that “Courts have found similar explanatory statements in committee reports to be\n\n‘persuasive indications’ of Congress’s wishes in vacating agency interpretations of law that run\n\ncontrary to those wishes.” Pls.’ Mot. at 17. However, Colony pre-dated Chevron, and the legislative\n\nhistory was but one of several reasons the Court rejected the Tax Commissioner’s interpretation of\n\nthe statute. The Plaintiffs did not cite a single case in which “encouragement” from Congress in the\n\nlegislative history, absent more, was accepted as a direct and controlling statement from Congress\n\nfor Chevron purposes that invalidates an agency interpretation that declined to follow Congress’\n\nrecommendation. The Court cannot overlook the fact the Committee recommended against a\n\nparticular course of action as opposed to prohibiting it. Therefore, the Court finds the Plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to show a likelihood of success on their Administrative Procedures Claim on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f       The Court cannot say that the Plaintiffs’ have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits. CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698645\"><a href=\"/opinion/698645/cityfed-financial-corp-v-office-of-thrift-supervision-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 746 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1995). On this basis alone, the Court could dispose of the Plaintiffs’ motion. See Apotex, Inc. v.\n\nFood & Drug Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186708\"><a href=\"/opinion/186708/apotex-inc-v-fda/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1253-54 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Nevertheless, the Court shall\n\nbriefly address the other factors relevant to the Plaintiffs’ request.\n\n       B.      Plaintiffs Will Not Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent an Injunction Pending Appeal\n\n       The Plaintiffs contend that their member agencies will suffer irreparable harm if the DRS\n\ngoes into effect pending resolution of the Plaintiffs’ appeal because HHS “ha[s] structured the DRS\n\nin a manner that virtually guarantees that grantees required to recompete will lose their designation\n\nas Head Start agencies.” Pls.’ Mot. at 18. The Court explained at length in its prior opinion why\n\nthis argument is faulty: in short, the Plaintiffs’ argument conflates two different standards in two\n\nseparate sections of the statute. 7/9/12 Mem. Opin. at 23-24 (comparing 42 U.S.C. § 9836(c)\n\n(regarding the requirements for the DRS) with 42 U.S.C. § 9836(d)(3) (indicating preference should\n\nbe given to certain applications in areas in which no grantee receives automatic renewal)).\n\nMoreover, as the Defendants note, participation in the competition process is triggered by the\n\ngrantees’ past deficiencies, the results of the competition process are based on the applicant’s\n\nprospective ability to provide services, and the Plaintiffs emphasize that their member agencies have\n\ncorrected any previously identified deficiencies. There is nothing in the record to support the\n\ncontention that it is “virtually guaranteed” that grantees forced to re-compete will not receive new\n\ngrants on the basis of the designation to re-compete in and of itself.4\n\n\n       4\n         To the extent grantees forced to re-compete actually provide lower-quality services than\nothers competing for grants, then the grantees may not receive new grants as part of DRS\ncompetition process. Defs.’ Opp’n at 6-7. It is the quality of the services the applicant can provide,\nnot designation under the DRS itself, that is outcome determinative.\n                                                  13\n\f        The Plaintiffs further contend that “the adverse business consequences of placement on the\n\nRecompete List for the Plaintiffs’ members will intensify in the months to come if the Court does\n\nnot enjoin the competition process pending resolution of the appeal.” Pls.’ Mot. at 21. However, the\n\nPlaintiffs fail to cite any examples of contracts, funding, or other “business consequences” that\n\nmight occur in the coming months, apart from the termination of the grants if member agencies are\n\nnot selected. The Plaintiffs’ member agencies were notified in early 2012 that they would be forced\n\nto re-compete, and the final round of applications closed in August 2012. The Plaintiffs provide no\n\nexplanation as to why now, eight months after the member agencies were designated for\n\ncompetition, unspecified “business consequences” will “intensify,” or the member agencies’ “ability\n\nto attract and retain staff” will be further impaired. Id. Moreover, the Plaintiffs fail to explain why\n\nany of these effects are irreparable. At best, the Plaintiffs have “only vaguely sketch[ed] the\n\ncontours” of the asserted harms. Cuomo v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory. Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"458541\"><a href=\"/opinion/458541/mario-m-cuomo-governor-of-the-state-of-new-york-and-county-of-suffolk-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">972</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 976\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1985). The Plaintiffs’ motion falls far short of showing that the injuries they face are\n\n“both certain and great.” Id. (citations omitted). Therefore, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs’ face a\n\nminor risk of irreparable injury absent an injunction pending appeal.\n\n        C.      Risk of Substantial Harm to Other Interested Parties\n\n        The Plaintiffs assert that “the adverse impact of an injunction on HHS would be\n\ninsubstantial.” Pls.’ Mot. at 21. Staying the DRS pending appeal would amount to more than\n\nsimply pressing the pause button on the re-competition process. If the Court of Appeals upholds the\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of the Defendants, the delay will have made the information in\n\nthe grant applications stale, requiring a new round of applications and review before grants can be\n\nfinally awarded. Decl. of S. Pinckney, ECF No. [34-1], ¶¶ 10-11. The delay would ultimately\n\nrequire the expenditure of significant resources and further delay in naming grantees and service\n                                                   14\n\fproviders. Id. Even if the injunction was limited to only those geographic areas covered by\n\nPlaintiffs’ member agencies that are subject to re-competition, this would still amount to re-doing\n\nthe entire grant application and review process for over 10% of the geographic areas receiving Head\n\nStart grants subject to competition. Id. at ¶ 9. Weighed against the potential irreparable injury\n\narticulated by the Plaintiffs, the Court finds the substantial risk of harm to other interested parties\n\noutweighs the risk of harm to the Plaintiffs. As such, the balance of harms favors denying the\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion.5\n\n        D.      Public Interest\n\n        As in most cases, the public interest is essentially a wash. The public has a vested interest in\n\nensuring that Federal Agencies enforce laws enacted by Congress. In other words, the final factor\n\nfavors whatever party prevails on appeal. Serono Labs., Inc. v. Shalala, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184662\"><a href=\"/opinion/184662/serono-labs-inc-v-ferring-pharm-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1326 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1998) (noting that “the public interest, also offers [Plaintiff] no support because it is inextricably\n\nlinked with the merits of the case”). Additionally, the public has a vested interest in ensuring that\n\nHead Start agencies are providing high quality services, including a safe environment for the\n\nchildren receiving services. Insofar as the Plaintiffs’ member agencies have been cited for\n\ndeficiencies regarding safety violations, implementation of the DRS will provide HHS the\n\nopportunity to evaluate these agencies’ capacities for providing a safe environment in the future. In\n\nthis respect, the public has a vested interest in permitting the re-competition process to move\n\nforward. Thus, the public interest weighs in favor of denying the requested injunctions.\n\n\n        5\n           It is also worth noting that enjoining the DRS would delay providing grants to agencies\n(other than those represented by the Plaintiffs) that would receive grants as part of the DRS\ncompetition. Thus to the extent the lack of an injunction impairs the business interests of the\nPlaintiffs, that injury is counterbalanced by the injury to other grantees whose funds will be delayed\nby the injunction. See Serono Labs., Inc. v. Shalala, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184662\"><a href=\"/opinion/184662/serono-labs-inc-v-ferring-pharm-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1326 (D.C. Cir. 1998).\n\n                                                    15\n\f                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds Plaintiffs failed to establish that an injunction\n\npending appeal is warranted. The Plaintiffs failed to show any likelihood of success on the merits,\n\nwhich weighs heavily against granting the Plaintiffs’ motion. The Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate\n\nthey will suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction. Conversely, the Defendants would have to\n\nexpend significant resources if the competition process was enjoined, and the injunction would\n\nsignificantly delay naming new grantees to provide Head Start services. Ultimately, the public\n\ninterest weighs against an injunction. On balance, the Court finds the equities do not weigh in favor\n\nof enjoining implementation of the DRS pending resolution of the Plaintiffs’ appeal. Accordingly,\n\nPlaintiffs’ [33] Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal is DENIED.\n\n       An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n                                                         /s/\n                                                      COLLEEN KOLLAR-KOTELLY\n                                                      UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f</pre>",
