On September 8, 2011, plaintiff\n                    homeowners’ association, Bridgestone Lakes Community\n                    Improvement Association filed suit for breach of fiduciary\n                    duty against the subdivision’s developer and three\n                    individuals who sat simultaneously on the homeowners’\n                    first board and on the developer’s board. (CR 5). They\n                    also brought claims for fraud and fraudulent concealment,\n                    (CR 7), negligence, gross negligence and willful\n                    misconduct. (CR 8). In addition, Plaintiffs brought a\n                    declaratory judgment action that they did not have to\n                    indemnify Defendants for attorneys’ fees. (CR 8). The\n                    Board members brought a counterclaim for indemnity.\n                    (CR 13).\n\nSummary Judgment:   On December 21, 2012, Judge Schaffer granted\n                    interlocutory summary judgment against the Plaintiffs on\n                    claims based on the failure to construct the pond according\n                    to plans approved by the Bridgestone MUD and its\n                    engineer. (CR SUPP3 3; CR Supp2 3). Plaintiffs brought\n                    multiple motions for rehearing/motions for new trial, and\n                    Plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Petition claiming the\n                    pond was not built according to the plans approved by the\n                    City and County. (CR SUPP 492). On April 3, 2013,\n                    Defendants filed a Motion for No-Evidence summary\n                    judgment (CR SUPP 164), and on March 21, 2013\n                    Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking\n                    indemnity (CR SUPP 32) and a Supplemental Motion for\n                    Summary Judgment. (CR SUPP 39). On March 7, 2014,\n                    Judge Schaffer dismissed Plaintiffs’ claims against the\n                    defendants based on the no evidence MSJ. (CR 97). The\n                    Judge filed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on\n                    June 10, 2014. (CR 297). A bench trial was held on the\n                    award of indemnity (RR 1: 1-94; RR 2) and Final\n                    Judgment was signed on June 27, 2014. (CR 318).\n\n                                   v\n\fPost-Trial:   Judgment was modified slightly as to the amount of the\n              attorneys’ fees. (CR 325). Notice of Appeal was filed on\n              July 24, 2014. (CR 336).\n\n\n\n\n                            vi\n\f                     STATEMENT ON ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n      These decisions rest purely on a matter of law and Appellant believes that\n\noral argument is not needed. However, if it is granted to Appellees, Appellant\n\nrequests oral argument.\n\n\n                      ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW\n\n\n      The trial court committed reversible error when it granted Summary Judgment\n\non Appellant’s claims concerning the variable slope of the pond’s sides, as the claims\n\nconcerning the variable slopes were not raised in the motion for summary judgment.\n\n      The trial court’s denial of the Second Motion for Rehearing and New Trial\n\nwas an abuse of discretion because the March 27, 2013 Request for Rehearing and\n\nMotion for New Trial showed that Plaintiff’s claims were not patently unmeritorious\n\nand that, once allowed discovery, they were able to raise fact issues on the elements\n\nof duty and causation, and for the equitable reason that opponent interfered with the\n\ndiscovery process making the new evidence not available earlier.\n\n      The trial court’s grant of the No Evidence Summary Judgment (CR 97) was\n\nharmful error because, at the time it was granted, the Fourth Amended Petition (CR\n\nSUPP 492) was the live pleading, and Plaintiffs had raised a fact issue of the\n\nelements of duty and causation (CR SUPP2 27) attacked by Defendants’ Motion for\n\nNo Evidence Summary Judgment. (CR SUPP 164).\n\n                                          vii\n\f      The trial court’s award of $94,990.73 in indemnity was excessive, and\n\nharmful error, because: (1) some of the fees were for labor that was purely\n\nunnecessary; (2) a multiplier of 0.5 times the total fees should have been applied\n\nrather than 0.75 because the three Board members who qualified for indemnity\n\nshould have been counted as one party because the work that was done for one of\n\nthem could have been used for the others without any more time being expended;\n\nand (3) in some matters the Board members were not the prevailing party so as to\n\nqualify for indemnity of the associated fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                         viii\n\f                           No. 14-14-00604-CV\n                          On Appeal to the Fourteenth Court\n                                  Of Appeals\n                                Houston, Texas\n\n\n                    Bridgestone Lakes Community Improvement\n                                 Association, Inc.\n                                    Appellant\n\n                                            v.\n\n               Bridgestone Lakes Development Company, Inc., et al\n                                   Appellees\n\n\n                ON APPEAL FROM CAUSE NO. 2011-53723-CV\n                    IN THE 152nd DISTRICT COURT OF\n                        HARRIS COUNTY. TEXAS\n\n\nTO THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      COMES NOW, APPELLANT, (hereinafter “the homeowners’ association”),\n\nand presents this, its Appellant’s Brief.\n\n\n                             STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Bridgestone Lakes Community Improvement Association, Inc. (“the\n\nhomeowners”) is a non-profit corporation composed of persons who reside and own\n\nhomes in the Bridgestone Lakes Subdivision, a small subdivision in the northern part\n\fof Harris County, Texas.     (CR SUPP2 4).       Bridgestone Lakes Development\n\nCompany, Inc. (‘the developer”) is the developer of the subdivision who built the\n\nhomes around a retention pond in a manner that violated good practices for building\n\nsuch ponds. (CR SUPP2 4). The homeowners complaint was not just that such poor\n\nbuilding caused added erosion of the sides of the pond. The homeowners’ prime\n\ncomplaint was these bad practices caused astronomical repair costs, which the\n\nhomeowners could not afford.1 They also complained that the early Board Members,\n\nwho also served on the Board of the Developer, fraudulently withheld information\n\nabout the settlement between the Developer and the Homeowners’ Association,\n\nrequiring that the new (homeowner) Board Members ratify the Agreement which\n\nwas unfair and very costly to the Homeowners’ Association – not just committing\n\nfraud but also breaches of their fiduciary duty and willful acts. (CR SUPP 2 3-10;\n\nCR SUPP 492-515). The flaws in the pond include: (1) the failure to put in a\n\nmaintenance berm, so that repairs could be done to the pond with heavy equipment,\n\nrather than by hand; (2) fencing off of the pond, again requiring hand rather than\n\n\n1\n  Excerpt from the deposition of Mr. Conner:\nQ: “…now we’re not saying that Mr. Hudson had anything to do with the nutria (a\nburrowing animal) but…did it cost more money to treat the nutria because there\nwas a sidewalk there, fencing and a lack of a berm.\nA: “Yes, I would say that it did. The means of treatment, rather than being more\nmechanical, in other words being able to go in with earth equipment…and\nexcavate the caves and then recompact…the only thing that could go in in a cost\neffective manner was a urethane injection system which we could carry down the\nsidewalk.” (CR Supp1 : 61)\n                                         2\n\fmachine repairs; (3) putting a sidewalk and fence immediately adjacent to the pond,\n\nthus increasing the slope angle on the pond; and (4) creating an inconsistent angle\n\nof the pond slope, from 2:1 to 3:1, resulting in inconsistent and increased erosion.\n\n(CR SUPP 2 3-10; CR SUPP 492-515).\n\n      Robert A. Hudson, Claudia J. Hudson and Tiffany A. Roath were individuals\n\nwho were on the Homeowners’ Association Board and were simultaneously on the\n\nboard of the Developer. (CR SUPP2 3-10; CR SUPP 7). This Board of Directors of\n\nthe homeowners signed a settlement agreement concerning the detention pond\n\nduring the tenure of the Hudsons and Ms. Roath. (CR Supp 74; CR SUPP 513). The\n\nsettlement agreement admitted that, “the Developer constructed the Section 1\n\nDetention Facilities in a manner that varies from the Approved Plans, and,\n\n“Stormwater Solutions has advised the parties that the variations from the Approved\n\nPlans will result in increased cost of Maintenance Work and an increased likelihood\n\nof requiring Major Maintenance Work.” (CR Supp1 : 74). In return for a $25,000\n\ndeposit by the Developer (which was a small amount of the actual costs)(CR SUPP\n\n633-34), the homeowners, led by Mr. Hudson, agreed not to hold the developer\n\nresponsible and agreed to have the Homeowners’ Association take over the repair\n\ncosts of the pond. (CR SUPP 506). The original Board kept quiet about their\n\nagreement with the Developer, and had the oncoming Board (i.e. Plaintiffs) accept\n\nall of their decisions, without knowing the existence of and ramifications of this\n\n\n                                         3\n\fAgreement. (CR SUPP2 19). The new board was asked to, and did, sign an\n\nagreement that made all of the old board’s actions final – without knowing what\n\nthese actions were. (CR SUPP2 6). When the new board found that the old board\n\nknew that the pond was built incorrectly and that the old board had agreed to accept\n\nsky-high maintenance costs, this lawsuit came about. (CR SUPP 526).\n\n      The Court awarded summary judgment to defendants on all of the\n\nhomeowners’ claims on December 21, 2012. (CR SUPP 3 3). Then, the Court\n\nawarded summary judgment on the No Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n(Fourth Amendment Petition) on March 7, 2014. (CR 97). A bench trial was had\n\non the old board members’ counterclaim for indemnity. (RR1; RR2). The Articles\n\nof Incorporation for Bridgestone Lakes Community Improvement Association, Inc.\n\nprovide for indemnification of board members “except in relation to matters as to\n\nwhich he shall be judged in such action, suit, or proceedings to be liable for gross\n\nnegligence or willful misconduct in the performance of duty.           BYLAWS    OF\n\nBRIDGESTONE LAKES COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT ASS’N, INC., art. XI, § 5. (RR2, Ex.\n\n1). Segregation of fees was the major issue of the bench trial. Because the interest\n\nof the old board members were identical, the homeowners’ argued that the actual\n\nfees should be split 50:50, with indemnity for only 50% of the total fees generated.\n\n(The developer was not eligible for indemnity.) The defendants argued that 75% of\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fthe total fees should be indemnified. (RR 1). The Court awarded 75% of the total\n\nfees as indemnification. (CR 325).\n\n\n                          SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Summary judgment is not proper on any claim not explicitly raised in the\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment. Defendants’ First Motion for Summary Judgment\n\nonly addressed the absence of duty and causation in regard to the homeowners’\n\nclaims that the absence of a berm caused damages and the sidewalk in the slope area\n\ncaused damages. It did not address, at all, the homeowners’ claims that the varying\n\nslopes of the pond caused damages. The homeowners were not required to raise a\n\nfact issue on causation or duty on this claim until it was raised in the motion for\n\nsummary judgment.      This affects summary judgment on all causes of action.\n\nGranting a summary judgment on causes of action not addressed in the motion is\n\nreversible error.\n\n      It should be reversible error not to grant a new trial where new evidence shows\n\nthat there were fact issues on all contested elements and the opponent’s interference\n\nwith the discovery process is the reason the new evidence was not formerly\n\navailable. The Second Motion for New Trial/ Motion for Rehearing established that\n\nthere was evidence of duty and causation on all causes of action and only because\n\nthe attorney for BMUD had “silenced” a material witness had the Plaintiffs not been\n\nable to bring this evidence forward in a timely manner.\n                                          5\n\f      Collateral estoppel did not apply to the Motion for No Evidence Summary\n\nJudgment and Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment. A different allegation\n\nwas at issue: that the Developer did not build the Detention Pond according to the\n\nPlans submitted to the City and County. Additionally, this had not been fully and\n\nfairly litigated earlier in the litigation. Evidence presented by Plaintiff raised a fact\n\nissue on duty and causation for each cause of action so summary judgment on the\n\nFourth Amended Original Petition was reversible error.\n\n      Finally, the attorneys’ fees awarded for indemnity were excessive. Only the\n\nindividual Defendants were entitled to indemnity under the Bylaws, and Plaintiffs\n\nargued that the legal fees incurred should have been multiplied by a multiplier of 0.5\n\nrather than 0.75 because the work done for the individuals was identical, making it\n\nhalf of total work done. Additionally, some of the work done, like preparation of a\n\njury charge when Defendants knew this was not a jury trial, was not reasonable and\n\nnecessary, and some amounts of time spent were excessive.\n\n\n                           APPELLANT’S ARGUMENTS\n\nFIRST ISSUE\n     The trial court committed reversible error when it granted summary\n     Judgment on Appellant’s claims concerning the variable slope of the\n     pond’s sides, as the claims concerning the variable slopes were not\n     raised in the motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      The Supreme Court has mandated the following standards for reviewing a\n\nmotion for summary judgment:\n\n      1) The movant for summary judgment has the burden of showing that there\n         is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a\n         matter of law.\n      2) In deciding whether there is a disputed material fact issue precluding\n         summary judgment, evidence favorable to the non-movant will be taken\n         as true; and\n      3) Every reasonable inference must be indulged in favor of the nonmovant\n         and any doubts resolved in its favor.\n\nNixon v. Mr. Property Management Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548-49 (Tex. 1985); see\n\nalso, Clark v. Pruitt, 820 S.W.2d 903, 905-06 (Tex. App. – Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n1991, no writ).\n\nARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES ON FIRST ISSUE\n\n      Appellees’ first motion for summary judgment attacked Appellant’s claims\n\nthat it was wrongful to fail to put in a thirty-foot maintenance berm and a sidewalk\n\nthat increased erosion in the pond. (CR SUPP1 8). In relation to the breach of\n\nfiduciary duty cause of action, Appellees attacked Appellant’s claims that “…the\n\nDefendants failed to build a thirty (30) foot maintenance berm, then they put in a\n\nsidewalk, which created more of a slope angle on the pond, which in turn increased\n\nthe rate of erosion.” (CR SUPP1 9). No mention of Appellant’s claim that anything\n\nto do with the variable slopes of the pond sides could be a breach of fiduciary duty-\n\n                                          7\n\for not a breach of fiduciary duty. With respect to the fraud action, Appellees\n\nattacked Appellant’s claims that the old board did not reveal “the fact that they failed\n\nto put in a thirty (30) foot maintenance berm and they put in a sidewalk that increased\n\nerosion in the pond.” (CRSUPP1 10). No mention that failure to tell the new board\n\nabout the variable slopes did – or did not – make a tenable fraud claim. With respect\n\nto Appellant’s negligence, gross negligence and willful misconduct claims, again,\n\nAppellees attack only “Plaintiff[’s] claims ‘that the Defendants’ failure to build a\n\nthirty (30) foot maintenance berm and their decision to build a sidewalk that\n\nincreased erosion…[was wrongful]” (CR SUPP 10). They make no mention of the\n\nvariable slopes of the pond. On the next page of the motion, Appellees continue,\n\n“As this Court knows, the existence of duty and causation of damages (due to the\n\nbreach of such duty) are questions of law for a trial court to determine from facts\n\nsurrounding the occurrence in question, which in this case is the purported duty to\n\nconstruct a thirty (30) foot maintenance berm and the presence of a sidewalk on\n\nside slope causing erosion. (CR SUPP 11, #12). On page CR SUPP 12, again they\n\nmention only the thirty (30) foot berm. (CR SUPP1 12, #13). On page CR SUPP1\n\n15, again the Appellees mention that “the presence of a sidewalk on the side slope\n\ndid not cause any damages repaired by Storm Water Solutions.” (CR SUPP1 15,\n\n#15). No mention of the variable slopes claimed by Appellant is made.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      A summary judgment motion must define the issues and put the non-moving\n\nparty on notice with adequate information to oppose the motion. Eckler v. Gen.\n\nCouncil of Assemblies of God, 784 S.W. 2d 935, 937 (Tex. App. – San Antonio 1990,\n\nwrit denied). How is a non-movant going to have adequate information to oppose\n\nan effort to eliminate their claims concerning the variable slopes, if all the movant\n\ntalks about is a thirty-foot berm and a sidewalk? The movant cannot hide the\n\ngrounds of attack under a bushel barrel of totally different attacks. The duty and\n\ncausation related to the uneven slopes would have been proven to exist by the\n\nDetention Pond Maintenance Agreement executed while Defendants were still on\n\nthe Board, (this was done so that BMUD would “approve” the pond and accept\n\nownership of the pond, CR SUPP 2 7). But there was no reason to raise it because\n\nDefendants had not attacked the duty and causation of the 2:1 to 3:1 slopes. An\n\nappellate court cannot read between the lines, infer or glean from the pleadings or\n\nthe proof any grounds for granting summary judgment other than those grounds\n\nexpressly set forth before the trial court. McConnell v. Southside Indep. School Dist.,\n\n858 S.W.2d 337, 343 (Tex. 1993). Summary judgment cannot be granted on the\n\nclaims about differing slopes.\n\n      An example where a movant failed to address all claims and was denied total\n\nsummary judgment occurred in Clark v. Pruitt, 820 S.W.2d 903 (Tex. App. –\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1991, no writ). Clark’s pleadings had raised estoppel as a\n\n\n                                          9\n\fcounter-affirmative defense to a limitations defense, and Pruitt did not address\n\nestoppel in his affidavit or his brief. Id. The appellate court reversed the summary\n\njudgment. Granting a summary judgment on causes of action not addressed in the\n\nmotion is reversible error. Desert Palm Properties, N.V. v. McFarlane, No. 01-92-\n\n00967-CV, 1994 Tex. App. LEXIS 2951 (Tex. App. – Houston [1st Dist.] Dec. 8,\n\n1994, writ denied). The first summary judgment should be reversed.\n\n\nSECOND ISSUE\n\n      The trial court’s denial of the Second Motion for Rehearing and New\n      Trial was an abuse of discretion because the March 27, 2013\n      Request for Rehearing and Motion for New Trial showed that\n      Plaintiff’s claims were not patently unmeritorious and that, once\n      allowed discovery, they were able to raise fact issues on the elements\n      of duty and causation.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      The summary judgment standard would apply to a Motion for Rehearing.\n\nAbuse of discretion is the correct standard to apply to a motion for new trial. A trial\n\ncourt has wide discretion in granting a new trial, and the trial court’s discretion will\n\nnot be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of manifest abuse of discretion.\n\nChampion Int’l Corp. v. Twelfth Court of Appeals, 762 S.W.2d 898, 899 (Tex. 1988).\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES ON SECOND ISSUE\n\n      Regarding the Motion for Summary Judgment entered December 21, 2012,\n\n(CR SUPP 3 3), Plaintiff filed two Motions for Rehearing and Motions for New\n\nTrial. This appellate issue pertains to the Second Motion for Rehearing and Motion\n\nfor New Trial, filed on March 27, 2013, (CR SUPP 41) and the Supplement filed the\n\nnext day. (CR SUPP 97).\n\n      The first cause of action in which duty has been brought into question by the\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment was breach of fiduciary duty. Summary judgment\n\nwas granted based on the Defendants having negated the existence of a fiduciary\n\nduty that could be breached. The Third Amended Original Petition alleged that all\n\nthree defendants were members of the Homeowners’ Association Board and the\n\nDetention Pond Maintenance Agreement (CR SUPP 74) showed Robert Hudson to\n\nhave been president of this Board. (CR SUPP 85-86). A fiduciary relationship is not\n\nlimited to cases where legal relations create a fiduciary duty as a matter of law,\n\nalthough Plaintiff would argue that this is such a case. A fiduciary relationship exists\n\nin all cases in which influence has been acquired and abused, in which confidence\n\nhas been reposed and betrayed and the origin of the confidence is immaterial. Noell\n\nv. City of Carrollton, 431 S.W. 3d 682 (Tex. App. – Dallas 2014, pet. denied). Here,\n\nthe homeowners trusted the Board to look out for their interests vis-à-vis the\n\n                                          11\n\fDeveloper and the “outside world”. This was sufficient to bring about a fiduciary\n\nduty or duty of utmost good faith and fair dealing. KCM Fin. LLC v. Bradshaw, No.\n\n13-0199, 2015 Tex. LEXIS 220 (Tex. Mar. 6, 2015). Moreover, self-dealing would\n\nbe a breach. All individuals were also employed by the Developer. Had they\n\ndecided to fix the pond according to Storm Water Solutions recommendations, the\n\ncost - $126,716 (CR SUPP 96) – would have been born mostly by the developer. By\n\nwaiting and not fixing the pond, the cost would be born by the homeowners. (CR\n\nSUPP 54, 57). This is at least some evidence of causation of damages. This shows\n\nthe breach of fiduciary duty claim not to have been a patently unmeritorious claim –\n\nthe only kind summary judgment is supposed to eliminate.\n\n      The next claim brought by the Plaintiff is fraud. Fraud is not only committed\n\nby a knowing misrepresentation; it is also committed by failure to make a\n\nrepresentation when one has a duty to do so. Greenberg Traurig of N.Y., P.C. v.\n\nMoody, 161 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. App. – Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.). One has a\n\nduty to disclose a material fact when there is a confidential (i.e. fiduciary)\n\nrelationship. Id. The signature on the Detention Pond Maintenance Agreement\n\nshows Robert Hudson to be the president of the Homeowners’ Board. (CR SUPP\n\n85-86). The summary judgment did not show Roath and Claudia Hudson not to be\n\nas the Plaintiff alleged, i.e. they were members of the Homeowners’ Association\n\nBoard, too. (CR SUPP2 6). The Maintenance Agreement showed that there was a\n\n\n                                        12\n\fmaterial fact to be told: the pond was not constructed as per plans (CR SUPP 52,\n\n74) and it would cost more to maintain or fix. (CR SUPP 74). The affidavit of Ms.\n\nWilkinson testified that they were not told, despite the fact that they had a\n\nresponsibility, as discussed above, for utmost goof faith and fair dealing. (CR SUPP\n\n57, 90, 96). Therefore they had a duty to tell the oncoming board this material fact,\n\nso they could either take care of it or sue the developer – theirs was a fiduciary\n\nrelationship which gave rise to a duty to “tell” and they didn’t. The summary\n\njudgment did not show that there was no duty to tell which was breached. Likewise,\n\nfor the same reasons, the summary judgment did not discount the causation of the\n\ndamages. (CR SUPP 54, 58, 61, 63, 77).\n\n      The next cause of action which the summary judgment had attacked was\n\nnegligence/gross negligence/willful conduct. In determining whether the defendant\n\nwas under a duty, the court will consider several interrelated factors, including the\n\nrisk, the foreseeability and the likelihood of injury weighed against the social utility\n\nof the actor’s conduct, the magnitude of the burden of guarding against the injury,\n\nand the consequences of placing the burden on the defendant…of all these factors,\n\nforeseeability of the risk is “the foremost and dominant consideration. Greater\n\nHouston Transp. Co. v. Phillips, 801 S.W.2d 523, 525 (Tex. 1990). Even a volunteer\n\nowes a duty to act non-negligently. Bodin v. Tenneco Oil Co., 373 S.W.2d 350 (Tex.\n\nApp – Corpus Christi 1963, writ ref’d n.r.e.). When the cost to fix the pond became\n\n\n                                          13\n\fknown, (CR SUPP 96), and the cause of the problem became known, (CR SUPP 54),\n\nand the fact that repairs would cost more if the pond were left as it was, (CR SUPP\n\n54, 57, 61), it was foreseeable that the costs of leaving it as it was would bury a small\n\nhomeowners’ association in costs and the ordinary prudent person would pay the\n\ncosts to completely fix the pond at a time when the Developer was still on the Board\n\nand the Developer would have to pay most of the costs. Given the foreseeability,\n\nparticularly, there was a duty to act non-negligently. The evidence of causation is\n\nas listed for the other causes of action. Summary judgment should not have been\n\ngranted on the negligence cause of action.\n\n      Gross negligence, to be the ground for exemplary damages, should be the\n\nentire want to care which would raise the belief that the act or omission complained\n\nof was the result of a conscious indifference to the right or welfare of the persons\n\naffected by it. Trans. Ins. Co. v. Moriel, 879 S.W.2d 10 (Tex. 1994). Given the\n\nactual knowledge that Defendants had, (CR SUPP 54, 58), and the large risk\n\n($126,716 for a small homeowners’ association – or any homeowners’ association\n\n(CR SUPP 96), and the lack of positive social utility of leaving it unfixed, and the\n\nminor imposition on a developer who has been a developer for many years –\n\nindicating substantial wealth – Defendants had a duty to not be grossly negligent.\n\nFactors that showed causation are the same as for the other torts. Summary judgment\n\nshould not have been entered on gross negligence.\n\n\n                                           14\n\f      Lastly, Jones and Carter and Storm Water Solutions confirmed that the pond\n\nwasn’t “right” and Defendant was made aware of the problem of huge costs. (CR\n\nSUPP 53-54, 58, 77, 90 and told how to fix it. (CR SUPP 96). Defendants failure\n\nto fix the pond was nothing short of willful misconduct. The same factors that\n\ngenerate a duty for gross negligence do so also for willful conduct. The same factors\n\nthat show causation for the other torts do so for willful conduct. Summary judgment\n\nshould not have been granted on willful conduct.\n\n      Defendants point to various pieces of evidence counter to Plaintiff’s evidence.\n\nHowever, all this establishes is that there are fact issues on some points. Conner\n\ntestified that the developer constructed the pond in a manner not according to his\n\nown plans.    (CR SUPP 52).       Then he testified that he couldn’t know if the\n\nBridgestone MUD engineers would have looked at the plans. (CR SUPP 103).\n\nConner currently does water utility operations, (CR SUPP 51) and Defendant\n\ndeveloper could be a possible client in the future. A summary judgment may be\n\nbased on the testimonial evidence of an interested witness is it is uncontroverted, or\n\non the expert testimony of an interested witness if the evidence is clear, positive,\n\ndirect, otherwise credible and free from contradictions and inconsistencies and could\n\nbe readily controverted. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c). The testimony about whether\n\nBMUD ever approved the plans is testimonial evidence. It is not uncontroverted,\n\nhowever: first Conner says he knows, then he says he doesn’t know. (CR SUPP\n\n\n                                         15\n\f103). This does not undermine Plaintiff’s causes of action. If evidence requires the\n\nCourt to assess credibility or resolve which time the witness was telling the truth, it\n\nis not proper for summary judgment. Reagan Nat’l Adver. of Austin, Inc. v. Lakeway\n\n620 Partners LP, No. 03-00-00719-CV, 2001 Texas App. LEXIS 4375 (Tex. App.\n\n– Austin June 29, 2001, pet. denied). Additionally, the Detention Pond Maintenance\n\nAgreement said the developers varied from the approved plans and say that these\n\nplans were approved by the District, BMUD. (CR SUPP 74, 76). This does not\n\nnegate any causes of action.\n\n      Defendant complains that evidence is heresay, but they did not get a ruling on\n\ntheir hearsay objection. A party seeking to exclude evidence must obtain a written\n\nruling on the objection. Stovall & Assoc. v. Hibbs Fin Ctr., Ltd., 409 S.W.3d 790,\n\n797 (Tex. App. – Dallas 2013, no pet.). Defendants did not do so for any of the\n\nalleged “hearsay.” (CR SUPP 50, et seq.) Moreover, business records that have\n\nbecome another entity’s primary record of the underlying transaction may be\n\nadmissible pursuant to TEX. R. EVID. R. 803 (6). Therefore, the estimate of costs\n\nto do remedial work on the pond, done by Storm Water Solutions, an engineering\n\nand water utility company, (CR. SUPP. 69), became the admissible business records\n\nto show causation of the inaccuracies in making the pond. (CR. SUPP. 96).\n\nLikewise, an email and its attachments are admissible as admissions of a party\n\nopponent. Direct Value, L.L.C. v. Stock Bldg. Sup., 388 S.W.3d, 391 n.5 (Tex. App.\n\n\n                                          16\n\f– Amarillo 2012, no pet.). A statement by a party’s agent or servant concerning the\n\nmatter within the scope of his agency or employment may be offered as an admission\n\nof the party itself. Trencor, Inc. v. Cornech Mach. Co., 115 S.W.3d 145, 151 (Tex.\n\nApp. – Fort Worth 2003, pet. denied). Therefore, the email from an engineer\n\n(Glessinger) at Storm Water Solutions while in the Defendants employ, that said\n\nrepairs would be more expensive because of the design, provides some evidence of\n\ncausation. (CR SUPP 90, 63). Exact cost estimates (CR SUPP 54, 57, 61, 77, 95-\n\n96) raise a fact issue against settlement boilerplate that says,” The cost of\n\nmaintenance work is uncertain and difficult to ascertain.” Causation and damages\n\nare for the trier of fact to determine.\n\n      Finally, Defendants claimed that Conner was not an engineer and was unfit to\n\ngive expert testimony. While Conner did testify that he did not know as much as an\n\nengineer, he was manager for Bridgestone MUD and currently does water utility\n\noperations. (CR SUPP 50-51). One would expect him to be familiar with costs,\n\npond maintenance, and proper construction of ponds. So he is qualified as an expert\n\nin those areas. However, this is not an area of expertise for expert testimony. The\n\nlogic is simple: Draw a one inch horizontal line. Draw a second one about an inch\n\naway. Draw two lines, at right angles, each starting at the right end of the one inch\n\nline. Make the first one two inches and the second one three inches. Now connect\n\nthe open sides to form a hypotenuse for each triangle. The hypotenuse is the slope\n\n\n                                          17\n\fof the pond wall. Any person of average eyesight can tell that the “three inch”\n\ntriangle is steeper than the “two inch triangle” (slopes vary around the pond) and can\n\ntell whether the slope is nearer to a 3:1 slope or a 2:1 slope. Conner’s testimony did\n\nnot need to be expert testimony. Simply by watching the areas with different slopes,\n\nhe couldn’t give a mathematical rate of ccx3/per hour but – he visited the pond at\n\nleast once a week (CR SUPP 50) – he could see which one was eroding faster.\n\n      Finally, testimony that Hudson was made aware of the problem with the side\n\nslopes and the increased costs is not hearsay, because it would have been Conner\n\ntelling him. At deposition, he was available for questioning.\n\n      Even this prime witness had not been deposed at the time summary judgment\n\nwas filed. Rarely is summary judgment allowed when most of the discovery has not\n\ncommenced. Ms. Rice’s Affidavit explained the need for Mr. Conner’s testimony,\n\nTenneco Inc. v. Enterprise Prods., 925 S.W.2d 640, 647 (Tex. 1996)(a party who\n\ncontends that it has not had time for discovery must file either an affidavit explaining\n\nthe need for further discovery…). She explained that the attorney for BMUD\n\nactively interfered with her getting any testimony from Mr. Conner, the prime\n\nwitness in the case. (CR SUPP 23-24). Interference with the discovery process is a\n\nserious matter. Judges have broad discretion whether to grant a new trial but they\n\ndo not have the discretion to allow discovery interference to change the result of a\n\ncase that, when the evidence comes in (as soon as possible after decision) makes it\n\n\n                                          18\n\fpainfully obvious that there are multiple fact issues that would preclude summary\n\njudgment. A motion for New Trial is an equitable proceeding. Such a result is\n\ninequitable and raises issues of judicial inefficiency for results that are likely to be\n\noverturned on appeal. Counsel did not find case authority saying that it is an abuse\n\nof discretion to deny a Motion for New Trial where: (1) discovery was interfered\n\nwith by the other side and (2) once discovery was obtained, it showed there were\n\nfact issues on all the elements in contention in the motion for summary judgment.\n\nHowever, this would be a narrow ruling, applicable only where there has been\n\ndiscovery interference, and it would follow guiding rules and principles to do equity\n\nand conserve judicial economy. For these reasons, the second denial of a Motion\n\nfor New Trial and Rehearing should be reversed, as should the First Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment.\n\nTHIRD ISSUE\n\n      The trial court’s grant of the No Evidence Summary Judgment (CR 97) was\n      harmful error because, at the time it was granted, the Fourth Amended\n      Petition (CR SUPP 492) was the live pleading, and Plaintiffs had raised a\n      fact issue of the elements of duty and causation (CR SUPP2 27) attacked by\n      Defendants’ Motion for No Evidence Summary Judgment. (CR SUPP\n      164).\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      Once a no-evidence motion for summary judgment is filed, the burden shifts\n\nto the non-moving party to present evidence raising an issue of material fact as to\n                                          19\n\fthe elements (duty and causation) specified in the motion. The evidence presented\n\nby the motion and response is reviewed in the light most favorable to the party\n\nagainst whom the summary judgment was rendered, crediting evidence favorable to\n\nthat party if reasonable jurors could and disregarding contrary evidence unless\n\nreasonable jurors could not. Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 581-82\n\n(Tex. 2006).\n\nARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES ON THIRD ISSUE\n\n   1. Collateral Estoppel\n      The Fourth Amended Original Petition changed the previous pleadings by\n\nclaiming that the Defendants erred by building the pond counter to the plans\n\napproved by the City of Houston and Harris County.\n\n      Defendants in their No Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment claimed that\n\ncollateral estoppel applied to bar Plaintiff’s claims. The essential elements of\n\ncollateral estoppel are: the facts sought to be litigated in the second action were fully\n\nand fairly litigated in the prior action; those facts were essential to the judgment in\n\nthe first action, and the parties were cast as adversaries in the first action. Cole v.\n\nG.O. Assoc., Ltd, 847 S.W.2d 429 (Tex. App. – Fort Worth 1993, writ denied). To\n\nmake a determination whether the facts in a case were litigated, the court considers\n\nthe following facts: whether the parties were fully heard, whether the court supported\n\nits decision with reasoned opinion, and whether the decision was subject to appeal\n\n                                           20\n\for was in fact reviewed on appeal. Id. An ultimate issue essential to the judgment\n\ndoes not refer to a claim or cause of action, but to factual determinations submitted\n\nto the jury that are necessary to form a basis of judgment. Housing Auth. of the CCC\n\nv. Massey, 878 S.W.2d 624, 627 (Tex. App. – Corpus Christi 1994, no writ).\n\n      The ultimate issue in the Fourth Amended Petition is that “Developer failed\n\nto build the Section 1 Detention Pond as per the plans that the Developer submitted\n\nto the City and County in 2001 and resubmitted in 2008 and the Defendants failed\n\nto reveal this to the new board members. (CR SUPP 497). This is a different fact\n\nthan having failed to build the pond to the plans submitted to BMUD. Therefore\n\ncollateral estoppel doesn’t apply.\n\n      Also, the facts in a case were not fully and fairly litigated. Mr. Conner testified\n\nthat he didn’t know if the plans were submitted to BMUD, but they were to the City.\n\n(CR SUPP 52). Other than that, there was no mention of plans submitted to the City\n\nand there has been no appeal until now. Collateral estoppel does not apply.\n\n      Comparison with the plans possibly approved by BMUD, (CR SUPP 74), the\n\nplans approved by the City did require a 3:1 slope, no sidewalk or fences. “The 2001\n\nand 2008 Plans that the Developer submitted to the City and County indicate that\n\nthere is a 3 to 1 slope around the pond…and the sidewalk and fence were not in the\n\nplans that the Developer submitted to the City and County in 2001 and 2008…before\n\nthe Section 1 Pond was completed the Defendant, Robert Hudson was made aware\n\n\n                                           21\n\fof the problem with the side slopes, fences and sidewalks, but he failed to correct\n\nthe problems. All of the Defendants failed to insure that the pond was built properly\n\nand their decisions regarded the pond protected the interests of the Developer and\n\nbenefitted the Developer financially.” (CR SUPP 498).\n\n   2. Duty & Causation Evidence\n\n      Because the discrepancy between the BMUD Plans and reality, and the\n\ndiscrepancy between the Houston/Harris County Plans and reality were the same,\n\nthe Court is directed to take judicial notice of the exhibits against summary judgment\n\nthat were presented with the Second Motion for Rehearing. (CR SUPP 50, et seq.)\n\nThese also function as exhibits against summary judgment on the Fourth Amended\n\nPetition. A builder owes a duty of ordinary care in the building of its product in a\n\ngood and workmanlike manner. Jim Walter Homes, Inc. v. Reid, 703 S.W.2d 701\n\n(Tex. App. – Corpus Christi 1985, no writ). To determine whether one has a duty\n\nnot to be grossly negligent, one looks at several interrelated factors, including the\n\nrisk, the foreseeability and the likelihood of injury weighed against the social utility\n\nof the actor’s conduct, the magnitude of the burden of guarding against the injury,\n\nand the consequences of placing the burden on the defendant…of all these factors,\n\nforeseeability of the risk is “the foremost and dominant consideration. Greater\n\nHouston Transp. Co., 801 S.W.2d at 525. Gross negligence includes two elements:\n\n(1) viewed objectively from the actor’s standpoint, the act or omission must involve\n\n\n                                          22\n\fan extreme degree of risk, considering the probability and magnitude of the potential\n\nharm to others, and (2) the actor must have actual, subjective awareness of the risk\n\ninvolved, but nevertheless proceed in conscious indifference to the rights, safety or\n\nwelfare of others. Mobil Oil Corp. v. Ellender, 968 S.W.2d 917 (Tex. 1998). There\n\nis no question that the Defendants, as Board Members knew that the Homeowners’\n\nAssociation faced an extreme degree of risk - $126,716 (CR SUPP 96) if the Board\n\ndid not fix the pond. It was foreseeable that they would actually have to pay extra\n\nmoney. (CR SUPP 54). Likewise,          the     Board   proceeded     with    conscious\n\nindifference not to make the repairs but to enter into an agreement where the\n\nhomeowners would be required to make the repairs. (CR SUPP 60). The Plaintiff\n\nhas raised more than a scintilla of evidence on the existence of duty and causation\n\nfor gross negligence.\n\n          Likewise, the Board had a duty not to commit willful misconduct. The\n\njust-discussed factors argue for a duty. Also, the utility of failing to correct the pond\n\nwas negative. (See, e.g. CR SUPP 61). And the burden on a developer could not\n\npossibly be as great as it would be on sixty-some-odd homeowners. The Plaintiff\n\nhas raised more than a scintilla of evidence of duty and causation on willful conduct.\n\n      Adopted herein by reference are the references to evidence by which Plaintiff\n\nraised more than a scintilla of an existence of duty and causation on the other causes\n\nof action. (See, infra, pp. 10-12).\n\n\n                                           23\n\fFOURTH ISSUE\n\n      The trial court’s award of $94,990.73 in indemnity was excessive, and\n      harmful error.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n    The Fourth Issue argues that fees are excessive for several reasons: (1) First\n\noff, no indemnity is owed at this time because Plaintiff has raised a fact issue on duty\n\nand causation in the Third Issue and less indemnity is owed because the First Issue\n\neliminated one of the claims on which summary judgment was attempted. Issues\n\nThree and Four should be sent back to the finder of fact in the trial court and, because\n\nthe indemnity agreement makes indemnity due only when it cannot be proven that\n\nDefendants did not commit gross negligence or willful acts, indemnity is premature.\n\nThus, the standard of review is de novo, and award of indemnity is premature.\n\n      Second, some of the fees were for work that was purely unnecessary. The\n\nstandard of review in remittitur cases is sufficiency of the evidence. Mission Park\n\nFuneral Chapel, Inc. v. Gallegos, No. 04-00-00459-CV, 2001 Tex. App. LEXIS\n\n2978 (Tex. App. – San Antonio May 9, 2001, no pet.).\n\n      Third, a multiplier of 0.5 should have been applied to the total bill because all\n\nthe Board member’s interests were identical and you should only have to do the same\n\nthing once for all three. The Developer was not entitled to indemnity. Again, the\n\nstandard of review in remittitur cases is sufficiency of the evidence. Id.\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\f      Finally, in some matters the Board members were not the prevailing party. I\n\ncould find no authority on this, but believe it to be a de novo review.\n\n\nARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES ON FOURTH ISSUE\n\n\n      A trial to the bench was had on indemnity. (RR1, RR2).\n      Section 5 of the Bylaws provides for indemnification as follows:\n       “The Association shall indemnify any Director, officer, or employee of the\nAssociation against expenses actually and necessarily incurred by him and any\namount paid in satisfaction of judgments in connection with any action, suit or\nproceedings, whether civil or criminal in nature, in which he is made a party by\nreason of being or having been a Director, officer or employee…except in relation\nto matters as to which he shall be judged in such action, suit or proceeding to be\nliable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of duty.” (CR\n27).\n      Because Plaintiff has taken steps in this appeal to overturn the No Evidence\n\nSummary Judgment on the issues of duty and causation for the causes of action of\n\ngross negligence and willful misconduct, it would be premature to indemnify any of\n\nthe Defendants. (Of course, by the terms of the Bylaws, the Developer is not eligible\n\nfor this indemnity.)\n\n      If such time comes as indemnity is an issue, there are other arguments against\n\nfull indemnity. Firstly, the interests for Robert Hudson, Claudia Hudson and Tiffany\n\nRoath were identical in this case. Plaintiff would argue that, like with jury charges\n\nand “strikes”, identical interests should be grouped together. Therefore, half of the\n\ntotal bill is reimburseable as indemnity and half is not because it is attributable to\n\n\n                                          25\n\fwork on the Developer’s behalf, an interest somewhat different from that of the\n\nBoard Members in that he may have done different acts and he is not eligible for\n\nindemnity.\n\n      Counsel for Defendant brought up the point that the judgment will be awarded\n\n“jointly and severally.” This is a red herring. What we are indemnifying is attorney\n\nlabor, quantified in hours, not payment of damages, as there presently are none. If\n\nPlaintiff is successful in its challenges and goes on to full trial, indemnification of a\n\njudgment may be an issue. But it is premature at this juncture. Therefore the\n\npossibility of joint and several damages has nothing to do with quantifying how\n\nmuch attorney labor was needed for what party.\n\n      Some of the labor expended simply wasn’t reasonable and necessary. Counsel\n\nfor Plaintiff testified to this at trial. (RR1). A total of $50,643.77 was not reasonable\n\nand necessary. Among items that were not reasonable and necessary are everything\n\nto do with a jury. A jury demand was made, (RR1 19-20), but no jury fee was ever\n\npaid. Defendants knew they weren’t having a jury, but counsel went on to do 22.35\n\nhrs (invoice 43332) on a jury charge and motion in limine. The Depositions on\n\nWritten Questions were for the benefit of the Developer (invoices 42975,\n\n43067)(RR1 23-32), so should not be paid to the Board Members. The amount of\n\ntime on invoice 43171 for a Motion for Summary Judgment was not reasonable\n\nbecause it was a simple motion with little research. (RR1 33). The Motion to Quash\n\n\n                                           26\n\fthe Conner Deposition was not necessary as Plaintiff still needed it for its rehearing\n\nand Defendants’ Counterclaim was on file. (RR1 37)(Invoice 43348). The Motion\n\nto Dismiss and Motion for Sanctions were not necessary. (RR1 40)(Invoice 43469,\n\n43559, 43676). Invoice 43412 only benefitted the developer. Rule 91a attorney’s\n\nfees are only awarded if you are successful, so they should not be awarded. (RR1\n\n41). The total amount of fees is $120,645.69. (RR1 55). Deducting those fees that\n\nwere not reasonable and necessary is: $120,645.69 - $ 50,643.77= $70,001.92.\n\nThen, by the apportionment formula discussed above, this should be $35.000.96 or\n\nhalf of the $70K to go toward indemnification. This Court should order a remittitur,\n\nif it orders any fees at all.\n\n\n                                CONCLUSION & PRAYER\n\n       This was a case where the Developer and the Developer’s hand-picked board\n\nmembers knew they had built a Detention Pond wrong and knew that they were\n\nsticking the homeowners for substantial extra costs. Through summary judgments\n\nlong before discovery had gotten off the ground they: (1) wrongfully got a first\n\nsummary judgment on grounds not addressed in the Motion; (2) defeated a motion\n\nfor new trial where the evidence showed that the first summary judgment shouldn’t\n\nhave been granted at all; (3) wrongfully got a no evidence summary judgment when\n\nthere was evidence of duty and causation; and (4) obtained an indemnity award for\n\nfar more than they deserved.\n                                         27\n\f      Plaintiff asks that the first summary judgment be reversed, the motion for new\n\ntrial be granted, the no evidence summary judgment be reversed, this case be\n\nreturned to the trial court for trial, and, if indemnity is still awarded, that it be for a\n\nmuch lower sum in keeping with reasonable and necessary fees. Plaintiff asks for\n\nsuch other and further relief as may be just.\n\n                                                 Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                 _____/s/ MB CHIMENE__________\n                                                 THE CHIMENE LAW FIRM\n                                                 Michele Barber Chimene\n                                                 TBN 04207500\n                                                 2827 Linkwood Dr.\n                                                 Houston, TX. 77025\n                                                 PH: 832 940-1471; no fax\n                                                 michelec@airmail.net\n\n\n                                                 LAW OFFICES OF M.

P. 166a(c)…………………………………………………………………………………\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                iv\n\f                    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nTrial:              This case involves a subdivision’s improperly-built\n                    retention pond.      On September 8, 2011, plaintiff\n                    homeowners’ association, Bridgestone Lakes Community\n                    Improvement Association filed suit for breach of fiduciary\n                    duty against the subdivision’s developer and three\n                    individuals who sat simultaneously on the homeowners’\n                    first board and on the developer’s board. (CR 5). They\n                    also brought claims for fraud and fraudulent concealment,\n                    (CR 7), negligence, gross negligence and willful\n                    misconduct. (CR 8). In addition, Plaintiffs brought a\n                    declaratory judgment action that they did not have to\n                    indemnify Defendants for attorneys’ fees. (CR 8). The\n                    Board members brought a counterclaim for indemnity.\n                    (CR 13).\n\nSummary Judgment:   On December 21, 2012, Judge Schaffer granted\n                    interlocutory summary judgment against the Plaintiffs on\n                    claims based on the failure to construct the pond according\n                    to plans approved by the Bridgestone MUD and its\n                    engineer. (CR SUPP3 3; CR Supp2 3). Plaintiffs brought\n                    multiple motions for rehearing/motions for new trial, and\n                    Plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Petition claiming the\n                    pond was not built according to the plans approved by the\n                    City and County. (CR SUPP 492). On April 3, 2013,\n                    Defendants filed a Motion for No-Evidence summary\n                    judgment (CR SUPP 164), and on March 21, 2013\n                    Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking\n                    indemnity (CR SUPP 32) and a Supplemental Motion for\n                    Summary Judgment. (CR SUPP 39). On March 7, 2014,\n                    Judge Schaffer dismissed Plaintiffs’ claims against the\n                    defendants based on the no evidence MSJ. (CR 97). The\n                    Judge filed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on\n                    June 10, 2014. (CR 297). A bench trial was held on the\n                    award of indemnity (RR 1: 1-94; RR 2) and Final\n                    Judgment was signed on June 27, 2014. (CR 318).\n\n                                   v\n\fPost-Trial:   Judgment was modified slightly as to the amount of the\n              attorneys’ fees. (CR 325). Notice of Appeal was filed on\n              July 24, 2014.

However, if it is granted to Appellees, Appellant\n\nrequests oral argument.\n\n\n                      ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW\n\n\n      The trial court committed reversible error when it granted Summary Judgment\n\non Appellant’s claims concerning the variable slope of the pond’s sides, as the claims\n\nconcerning the variable slopes were not raised in the motion for summary judgment.\n\n      The trial court’s denial of the Second Motion for Rehearing and New Trial\n\nwas an abuse of discretion because the March 27, 2013 Request for Rehearing and\n\nMotion for New Trial showed that Plaintiff’s claims were not patently unmeritorious\n\nand that, once allowed discovery, they were able to raise fact issues on the elements\n\nof duty and causation, and for the equitable reason that opponent interfered with the\n\ndiscovery process making the new evidence not available earlier.\n\n      The trial court’s grant of the No Evidence Summary Judgment (CR 97) was\n\nharmful error because, at the time it was granted, the Fourth Amended Petition (CR\n\nSUPP 492) was the live pleading, and Plaintiffs had raised a fact issue of the\n\nelements of duty and causation (CR SUPP2 27) attacked by Defendants’ Motion for\n\nNo Evidence Summary Judgment. (CR SUPP 164).\n\n                                          vii\n\f      The trial court’s award of $94,990.73 in indemnity was excessive, and\n\nharmful error, because: (1) some of the fees were for labor that was purely\n\nunnecessary; (2) a multiplier of 0.5 times the total fees should have been applied\n\nrather than 0.75 because the three Board members who qualified for indemnity\n\nshould have been counted as one party because the work that was done for one of\n\nthem could have been used for the others without any more time being expended;\n\nand (3) in some matters the Board members were not the prevailing party so as to\n\nqualify for indemnity of the associated fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                         viii\n\f                           No. 14-14-00604-CV\n                          On Appeal to the Fourteenth Court\n                                  Of Appeals\n                                Houston, Texas\n\n\n                    Bridgestone Lakes Community Improvement\n                                 Association, Inc.\n                                    Appellant\n\n                                            v.\n\n               Bridgestone Lakes Development Company, Inc., et al\n                                   Appellees\n\n\n                ON APPEAL FROM CAUSE NO. 2011-53723-CV\n                    IN THE 152nd DISTRICT COURT OF\n                        HARRIS COUNTY. TEXAS\n\n\nTO THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      COMES NOW, APPELLANT, (hereinafter “the homeowners’ association”),\n\nand presents this, its Appellant’s Brief.\n\n\n                             STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Bridgestone Lakes Community Improvement Association, Inc. (“the\n\nhomeowners”) is a non-profit corporation composed of persons who reside and own\n\nhomes in the Bridgestone Lakes Subdivision, a small subdivision in the northern part\n\fof Harris County, Texas.     (CR SUPP2 4).       Bridgestone Lakes Development\n\nCompany, Inc. (‘the developer”) is the developer of the subdivision who built the\n\nhomes around a retention pond in a manner that violated good practices for building\n\nsuch ponds. (CR SUPP2 4). The homeowners complaint was not just that such poor\n\nbuilding caused added erosion of the sides of the pond. The homeowners’ prime\n\ncomplaint was these bad practices caused astronomical repair costs, which the\n\nhomeowners could not afford.1 They also complained that the early Board Members,\n\nwho also served on the Board of the Developer, fraudulently withheld information\n\nabout the settlement between the Developer and the Homeowners’ Association,\n\nrequiring that the new (homeowner) Board Members ratify the Agreement which\n\nwas unfair and very costly to the Homeowners’ Association – not just committing\n\nfraud but also breaches of their fiduciary duty and willful acts. (CR SUPP 2 3-10;\n\nCR SUPP 492-515). The flaws in the pond include: (1) the failure to put in a\n\nmaintenance berm, so that repairs could be done to the pond with heavy equipment,\n\nrather than by hand; (2) fencing off of the pond, again requiring hand rather than\n\n\n1\n  Excerpt from the deposition of Mr. Conner:\nQ: “…now we’re not saying that Mr. Hudson had anything to do with the nutria (a\nburrowing animal) but…did it cost more money to treat the nutria because there\nwas a sidewalk there, fencing and a lack of a berm.\nA: “Yes, I would say that it did. The means of treatment, rather than being more\nmechanical, in other words being able to go in with earth equipment…and\nexcavate the caves and then recompact…the only thing that could go in in a cost\neffective manner was a urethane injection system which we could carry down the\nsidewalk.” (CR Supp1 : 61)\n                                         2\n\fmachine repairs; (3) putting a sidewalk and fence immediately adjacent to the pond,\n\nthus increasing the slope angle on the pond; and (4) creating an inconsistent angle\n\nof the pond slope, from 2:1 to 3:1, resulting in inconsistent and increased erosion.\n\n(CR SUPP 2 3-10; CR SUPP 492-515).\n\n      Robert A. Hudson, Claudia J. Hudson and Tiffany A. Roath were individuals\n\nwho were on the Homeowners’ Association Board and were simultaneously on the\n\nboard of the Developer. (CR SUPP2 3-10; CR SUPP 7). This Board of Directors of\n\nthe homeowners signed a settlement agreement concerning the detention pond\n\nduring the tenure of the Hudsons and Ms. Roath. (CR Supp 74; CR SUPP 513). The\n\nsettlement agreement admitted that, “the Developer constructed the Section 1\n\nDetention Facilities in a manner that varies from the Approved Plans, and,\n\n“Stormwater Solutions has advised the parties that the variations from the Approved\n\nPlans will result in increased cost of Maintenance Work and an increased likelihood\n\nof requiring Major Maintenance Work.” (CR Supp1 : 74). In return for a $25,000\n\ndeposit by the Developer (which was a small amount of the actual costs)(CR SUPP\n\n633-34), the homeowners, led by Mr. Hudson, agreed not to hold the developer\n\nresponsible and agreed to have the Homeowners’ Association take over the repair\n\ncosts of the pond. (CR SUPP 506). The original Board kept quiet about their\n\nagreement with the Developer, and had the oncoming Board (i.e. Plaintiffs) accept\n\nall of their decisions, without knowing the existence of and ramifications of this\n\n\n                                         3\n\fAgreement. (CR SUPP2 19). The new board was asked to, and did, sign an\n\nagreement that made all of the old board’s actions final – without knowing what\n\nthese actions were. (CR SUPP2 6). When the new board found that the old board\n\nknew that the pond was built incorrectly and that the old board had agreed to accept\n\nsky-high maintenance costs, this lawsuit came about. (CR SUPP 526).\n\n      The Court awarded summary judgment to defendants on all of the\n\nhomeowners’ claims on December 21, 2012. (CR SUPP 3 3). Then, the Court\n\nawarded summary judgment on the No Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n(Fourth Amendment Petition) on March 7, 2014. (CR 97). A bench trial was had\n\non the old board members’ counterclaim for indemnity. (RR1; RR2). The Articles\n\nof Incorporation for Bridgestone Lakes Community Improvement Association, Inc.\n\nprovide for indemnification of board members “except in relation to matters as to\n\nwhich he shall be judged in such action, suit, or proceedings to be liable for gross\n\nnegligence or willful misconduct in the performance of duty.           BYLAWS    OF\n\nBRIDGESTONE LAKES COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT ASS’N, INC., art. XI, § 5. (RR2, Ex.\n\n1). Segregation of fees was the major issue of the bench trial. Because the interest\n\nof the old board members were identical, the homeowners’ argued that the actual\n\nfees should be split 50:50, with indemnity for only 50% of the total fees generated.\n\n(The developer was not eligible for indemnity.) The defendants argued that 75% of\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fthe total fees should be indemnified. (RR 1). The Court awarded 75% of the total\n\nfees as indemnification. (CR 325).\n\n\n                          SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Summary judgment is not proper on any claim not explicitly raised in the\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment. Defendants’ First Motion for Summary Judgment\n\nonly addressed the absence of duty and causation in regard to the homeowners’\n\nclaims that the absence of a berm caused damages and the sidewalk in the slope area\n\ncaused damages. It did not address, at all, the homeowners’ claims that the varying\n\nslopes of the pond caused damages. The homeowners were not required to raise a\n\nfact issue on causation or duty on this claim until it was raised in the motion for\n\nsummary judgment.      This affects summary judgment on all causes of action.\n\nGranting a summary judgment on causes of action not addressed in the motion is\n\nreversible error.\n\n      It should be reversible error not to grant a new trial where new evidence shows\n\nthat there were fact issues on all contested elements and the opponent’s interference\n\nwith the discovery process is the reason the new evidence was not formerly\n\navailable. The Second Motion for New Trial/ Motion for Rehearing established that\n\nthere was evidence of duty and causation on all causes of action and only because\n\nthe attorney for BMUD had “silenced” a material witness had the Plaintiffs not been\n\nable to bring this evidence forward in a timely manner.\n                                          5\n\f      Collateral estoppel did not apply to the Motion for No Evidence Summary\n\nJudgment and Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment. A different allegation\n\nwas at issue: that the Developer did not build the Detention Pond according to the\n\nPlans submitted to the City and County. Additionally, this had not been fully and\n\nfairly litigated earlier in the litigation. Evidence presented by Plaintiff raised a fact\n\nissue on duty and causation for each cause of action so summary judgment on the\n\nFourth Amended Original Petition was reversible error.\n\n      Finally, the attorneys’ fees awarded for indemnity were excessive. Only the\n\nindividual Defendants were entitled to indemnity under the Bylaws, and Plaintiffs\n\nargued that the legal fees incurred should have been multiplied by a multiplier of 0.5\n\nrather than 0.75 because the work done for the individuals was identical, making it\n\nhalf of total work done. Additionally, some of the work done, like preparation of a\n\njury charge when Defendants knew this was not a jury trial, was not reasonable and\n\nnecessary, and some amounts of time spent were excessive.\n\n\n                           APPELLANT’S ARGUMENTS\n\nFIRST ISSUE\n     The trial court committed reversible error when it granted summary\n     Judgment on Appellant’s claims concerning the variable slope of the\n     pond’s sides, as the claims concerning the variable slopes were not\n     raised in the motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      The Supreme Court has mandated the following standards for reviewing a\n\nmotion for summary judgment:\n\n      1) The movant for summary judgment has the burden of showing that there\n         is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a\n         matter of law.\n      2) In deciding whether there is a disputed material fact issue precluding\n         summary judgment, evidence favorable to the non-movant will be taken\n         as true; and\n      3) Every reasonable inference must be indulged in favor of the nonmovant\n         and any doubts resolved in its favor.\n\nNixon v.

App. – Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n1991, no writ).\n\nARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES ON FIRST ISSUE\n\n      Appellees’ first motion for summary judgment attacked Appellant’s claims\n\nthat it was wrongful to fail to put in a thirty-foot maintenance berm and a sidewalk\n\nthat increased erosion in the pond. (CR SUPP1 8). In relation to the breach of\n\nfiduciary duty cause of action, Appellees attacked Appellant’s claims that “…the\n\nDefendants failed to build a thirty (30) foot maintenance berm, then they put in a\n\nsidewalk, which created more of a slope angle on the pond, which in turn increased\n\nthe rate of erosion.” (CR SUPP1 9). No mention of Appellant’s claim that anything\n\nto do with the variable slopes of the pond sides could be a breach of fiduciary duty-\n\n                                          7\n\for not a breach of fiduciary duty. With respect to the fraud action, Appellees\n\nattacked Appellant’s claims that the old board did not reveal “the fact that they failed\n\nto put in a thirty (30) foot maintenance berm and they put in a sidewalk that increased\n\nerosion in the pond.” (CRSUPP1 10). No mention that failure to tell the new board\n\nabout the variable slopes did – or did not – make a tenable fraud claim. With respect\n\nto Appellant’s negligence, gross negligence and willful misconduct claims, again,\n\nAppellees attack only “Plaintiff[’s] claims ‘that the Defendants’ failure to build a\n\nthirty (30) foot maintenance berm and their decision to build a sidewalk that\n\nincreased erosion…[was wrongful]” (CR SUPP 10). They make no mention of the\n\nvariable slopes of the pond. On the next page of the motion, Appellees continue,\n\n“As this Court knows, the existence of duty and causation of damages (due to the\n\nbreach of such duty) are questions of law for a trial court to determine from facts\n\nsurrounding the occurrence in question, which in this case is the purported duty to\n\nconstruct a thirty (30) foot maintenance berm and the presence of a sidewalk on\n\nside slope causing erosion. (CR SUPP 11, #12). On page CR SUPP 12, again they\n\nmention only the thirty (30) foot berm. (CR SUPP1 12, #13). On page CR SUPP1\n\n15, again the Appellees mention that “the presence of a sidewalk on the side slope\n\ndid not cause any damages repaired by Storm Water Solutions.” (CR SUPP1 15,\n\n#15). No mention of the variable slopes claimed by Appellant is made.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      A summary judgment motion must define the issues and put the non-moving\n\nparty on notice with adequate information to oppose the motion. Eckler v. Gen.\n\nCouncil of Assemblies of God, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1636576\"><a href=\"/opinion/1636576/eckler-v-gen-coun-of-assemblies-of-god/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 937 (Tex. App. – San Antonio 1990,\n\nwrit denied). How is a non-movant going to have adequate information to oppose\n\nan effort to eliminate their claims concerning the variable slopes, if all the movant\n\ntalks about is a thirty-foot berm and a sidewalk? The movant cannot hide the\n\ngrounds of attack under a bushel barrel of totally different attacks. The duty and\n\ncausation related to the uneven slopes would have been proven to exist by the\n\nDetention Pond Maintenance Agreement executed while Defendants were still on\n\nthe Board, (this was done so that BMUD would “approve” the pond and accept\n\nownership of the pond, CR SUPP 2 7). But there was no reason to raise it because\n\nDefendants had not attacked the duty and causation of the 2:1 to 3:1 slopes. An\n\nappellate court cannot read between the lines, infer or glean from the pleadings or\n\nthe proof any grounds for granting summary judgment other than those grounds\n\nexpressly set forth before the trial court.

Summary judgment cannot be granted on the\n\nclaims about differing slopes.\n\n      An example where a movant failed to address all claims and was denied total\n\nsummary judgment occurred in Clark v. Pruitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1522041\"><a href=\"/opinion/1522041/clark-v-pruett/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">903</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App. –\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1991, no writ). Clark’s pleadings had raised estoppel as a\n\n\n                                          9\n\fcounter-affirmative defense to a limitations defense, and Pruitt did not address\n\nestoppel in his affidavit or his brief. Id. The appellate court reversed the summary\n\njudgment. Granting a summary judgment on causes of action not addressed in the\n\nmotion is reversible error. Desert Palm Properties, N.V. v. McFarlane, No. 01-92-\n\n00967-CV, 1994 Tex. App. LEXIS 2951 (Tex. App. – Houston [1st Dist.] Dec. 8,\n\n1994, writ denied). The first summary judgment should be reversed.\n\n\nSECOND ISSUE\n\n      The trial court’s denial of the Second Motion for Rehearing and New\n      Trial was an abuse of discretion because the March 27, 2013\n      Request for Rehearing and Motion for New Trial showed that\n      Plaintiff’s claims were not patently unmeritorious and that, once\n      allowed discovery, they were able to raise fact issues on the elements\n      of duty and causation.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      The summary judgment standard would apply to a Motion for Rehearing.\n\nAbuse of discretion is the correct standard to apply to a motion for new trial. A trial\n\ncourt has wide discretion in granting a new trial, and the trial court’s discretion will\n\nnot be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of manifest abuse of discretion.\n\nChampion Int’l Corp. v. Twelfth Court of Appeals, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2469603\"><a href=\"/opinion/2469603/champion-international-corp-v-twelfth-court-of-appeals/\"><span class=\"volume\">762</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 899 (Tex. 1988).\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES ON SECOND ISSUE\n\n      Regarding the Motion for Summary Judgment entered December 21, 2012,\n\n(CR SUPP 3 3), Plaintiff filed two Motions for Rehearing and Motions for New\n\nTrial. This appellate issue pertains to the Second Motion for Rehearing and Motion\n\nfor New Trial, filed on March 27, 2013, (CR SUPP 41) and the Supplement filed the\n\nnext day. (CR SUPP 97).\n\n      The first cause of action in which duty has been brought into question by the\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment was breach of fiduciary duty. Summary judgment\n\nwas granted based on the Defendants having negated the existence of a fiduciary\n\nduty that could be breached. The Third Amended Original Petition alleged that all\n\nthree defendants were members of the Homeowners’ Association Board and the\n\nDetention Pond Maintenance Agreement (CR SUPP 74) showed Robert Hudson to\n\nhave been president of this Board. (CR SUPP 85-86). A fiduciary relationship is not\n\nlimited to cases where legal relations create a fiduciary duty as a matter of law,\n\nalthough Plaintiff would argue that this is such a case. A fiduciary relationship exists\n\nin all cases in which influence has been acquired and abused, in which confidence\n\nhas been reposed and betrayed and the origin of the confidence is immaterial.

App. – Dallas 2014, pet. denied). Here,\n\nthe homeowners trusted the Board to look out for their interests vis-à-vis the\n\n                                          11\n\fDeveloper and the “outside world”. This was sufficient to bring about a fiduciary\n\nduty or duty of utmost good faith and fair dealing. KCM Fin. LLC v. Bradshaw, No.\n\n13-0199, 2015 Tex. LEXIS 220 (Tex. Mar. 6, 2015). Moreover, self-dealing would\n\nbe a breach. All individuals were also employed by the Developer. Had they\n\ndecided to fix the pond according to Storm Water Solutions recommendations, the\n\ncost - $126,716 (CR SUPP 96) – would have been born mostly by the developer. By\n\nwaiting and not fixing the pond, the cost would be born by the homeowners. (CR\n\nSUPP 54, 57). This is at least some evidence of causation of damages. This shows\n\nthe breach of fiduciary duty claim not to have been a patently unmeritorious claim –\n\nthe only kind summary judgment is supposed to eliminate.\n\n      The next claim brought by the Plaintiff is fraud. Fraud is not only committed\n\nby a knowing misrepresentation; it is also committed by failure to make a\n\nrepresentation when one has a duty to do so. Greenberg Traurig of N.Y., P.C. v.\n\nMoody, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2342919\"><a href=\"/opinion/2342919/greenberg-traurig-of-new-york-v-moody/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App. – Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.). One has a\n\nduty to disclose a material fact when there is a confidential (i.e. fiduciary)\n\nrelationship. Id. The signature on the Detention Pond Maintenance Agreement\n\nshows Robert Hudson to be the president of the Homeowners’ Board. (CR SUPP\n\n85-86). The summary judgment did not show Roath and Claudia Hudson not to be\n\nas the Plaintiff alleged, i.e. they were members of the Homeowners’ Association\n\nBoard, too. (CR SUPP2 6). The Maintenance Agreement showed that there was a\n\n\n                                        12\n\fmaterial fact to be told: the pond was not constructed as per plans (CR SUPP 52,\n\n74) and it would cost more to maintain or fix. (CR SUPP 74). The affidavit of Ms.\n\nWilkinson testified that they were not told, despite the fact that they had a\n\nresponsibility, as discussed above, for utmost goof faith and fair dealing. (CR SUPP\n\n57, 90, 96). Therefore they had a duty to tell the oncoming board this material fact,\n\nso they could either take care of it or sue the developer – theirs was a fiduciary\n\nrelationship which gave rise to a duty to “tell” and they didn’t. The summary\n\njudgment did not show that there was no duty to tell which was breached. Likewise,\n\nfor the same reasons, the summary judgment did not discount the causation of the\n\ndamages. (CR SUPP 54, 58, 61, 63, 77).\n\n      The next cause of action which the summary judgment had attacked was\n\nnegligence/gross negligence/willful conduct. In determining whether the defendant\n\nwas under a duty, the court will consider several interrelated factors, including the\n\nrisk, the foreseeability and the likelihood of injury weighed against the social utility\n\nof the actor’s conduct, the magnitude of the burden of guarding against the injury,\n\nand the consequences of placing the burden on the defendant…of all these factors,\n\nforeseeability of the risk is “the foremost and dominant consideration.

Given the\n\nactual knowledge that Defendants had, (CR SUPP 54, 58), and the large risk\n\n($126,716 for a small homeowners’ association – or any homeowners’ association\n\n(CR SUPP 96), and the lack of positive social utility of leaving it unfixed, and the\n\nminor imposition on a developer who has been a developer for many years –\n\nindicating substantial wealth – Defendants had a duty to not be grossly negligent.\n\nFactors that showed causation are the same as for the other torts. Summary judgment\n\nshould not have been entered on gross negligence.\n\n\n                                           14\n\f      Lastly, Jones and Carter and Storm Water Solutions confirmed that the pond\n\nwasn’t “right” and Defendant was made aware of the problem of huge costs. (CR\n\nSUPP 53-54, 58, 77, 90 and told how to fix it. (CR SUPP 96). Defendants failure\n\nto fix the pond was nothing short of willful misconduct. The same factors that\n\ngenerate a duty for gross negligence do so also for willful conduct. The same factors\n\nthat show causation for the other torts do so for willful conduct. Summary judgment\n\nshould not have been granted on willful conduct.\n\n      Defendants point to various pieces of evidence counter to Plaintiff’s evidence.\n\nHowever, all this establishes is that there are fact issues on some points. Conner\n\ntestified that the developer constructed the pond in a manner not according to his\n\nown plans.    (CR SUPP 52).       Then he testified that he couldn’t know if the\n\nBridgestone MUD engineers would have looked at the plans. (CR SUPP 103).\n\nConner currently does water utility operations, (CR SUPP 51) and Defendant\n\ndeveloper could be a possible client in the future. A summary judgment may be\n\nbased on the testimonial evidence of an interested witness is it is uncontroverted, or\n\non the expert testimony of an interested witness if the evidence is clear, positive,\n\ndirect, otherwise credible and free from contradictions and inconsistencies and could\n\nbe readily controverted. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c). The testimony about whether\n\nBMUD ever approved the plans is testimonial evidence. It is not uncontroverted,\n\nhowever: first Conner says he knows, then he says he doesn’t know. (CR SUPP\n\n\n                                         15\n\f103). This does not undermine Plaintiff’s causes of action. If evidence requires the\n\nCourt to assess credibility or resolve which time the witness was telling the truth, it\n\nis not proper for summary judgment. Reagan Nat’l Adver. of Austin, Inc. v. Lakeway\n\n620 Partners LP, No. 03-00-00719-CV, 2001 Texas App. LEXIS 4375 (Tex. App.\n\n– Austin June 29, 2001, pet. denied). Additionally, the Detention Pond Maintenance\n\nAgreement said the developers varied from the approved plans and say that these\n\nplans were approved by the District, BMUD. (CR SUPP 74, 76). This does not\n\nnegate any causes of action.\n\n      Defendant complains that evidence is heresay, but they did not get a ruling on\n\ntheir hearsay objection. A party seeking to exclude evidence must obtain a written\n\nruling on the objection. Stovall & Assoc. v.

Moreover, business records that have\n\nbecome another entity’s primary record of the underlying transaction may be\n\nadmissible pursuant to TEX. R. EVID. R. 803 (6). Therefore, the estimate of costs\n\nto do remedial work on the pond, done by Storm Water Solutions, an engineering\n\nand water utility company, (CR. SUPP. 69), became the admissible business records\n\nto show causation of the inaccuracies in making the pond. (CR.

Therefore, the email from an engineer\n\n(Glessinger) at Storm Water Solutions while in the Defendants employ, that said\n\nrepairs would be more expensive because of the design, provides some evidence of\n\ncausation. (CR SUPP 90, 63). Exact cost estimates (CR SUPP 54, 57, 61, 77, 95-\n\n96) raise a fact issue against settlement boilerplate that says,” The cost of\n\nmaintenance work is uncertain and difficult to ascertain.” Causation and damages\n\nare for the trier of fact to determine.\n\n      Finally, Defendants claimed that Conner was not an engineer and was unfit to\n\ngive expert testimony. While Conner did testify that he did not know as much as an\n\nengineer, he was manager for Bridgestone MUD and currently does water utility\n\noperations. (CR SUPP 50-51). One would expect him to be familiar with costs,\n\npond maintenance, and proper construction of ponds. So he is qualified as an expert\n\nin those areas. However, this is not an area of expertise for expert testimony. The\n\nlogic is simple: Draw a one inch horizontal line. Draw a second one about an inch\n\naway. Draw two lines, at right angles, each starting at the right end of the one inch\n\nline. Make the first one two inches and the second one three inches. Now connect\n\nthe open sides to form a hypotenuse for each triangle. The hypotenuse is the slope\n\n\n                                          17\n\fof the pond wall. Any person of average eyesight can tell that the “three inch”\n\ntriangle is steeper than the “two inch triangle” (slopes vary around the pond) and can\n\ntell whether the slope is nearer to a 3:1 slope or a 2:1 slope. Conner’s testimony did\n\nnot need to be expert testimony. Simply by watching the areas with different slopes,\n\nhe couldn’t give a mathematical rate of ccx3/per hour but – he visited the pond at\n\nleast once a week (CR SUPP 50) – he could see which one was eroding faster.\n\n      Finally, testimony that Hudson was made aware of the problem with the side\n\nslopes and the increased costs is not hearsay, because it would have been Conner\n\ntelling him. At deposition, he was available for questioning.\n\n      Even this prime witness had not been deposed at the time summary judgment\n\nwas filed. Rarely is summary judgment allowed when most of the discovery has not\n\ncommenced. Ms. Rice’s Affidavit explained the need for Mr. Conner’s testimony,\n\nTenneco Inc. v. Enterprise Prods., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1768079\"><a href=\"/opinion/1768079/tenneco-inc-v-enterprise-products-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 647 (Tex. 1996)(a party who\n\ncontends that it has not had time for discovery must file either an affidavit explaining\n\nthe need for further discovery…). She explained that the attorney for BMUD\n\nactively interfered with her getting any testimony from Mr. Conner, the prime\n\nwitness in the case. (CR SUPP 23-24). Interference with the discovery process is a\n\nserious matter. Judges have broad discretion whether to grant a new trial but they\n\ndo not have the discretion to allow discovery interference to change the result of a\n\ncase that, when the evidence comes in (as soon as possible after decision) makes it\n\n\n                                          18\n\fpainfully obvious that there are multiple fact issues that would preclude summary\n\njudgment. A motion for New Trial is an equitable proceeding. Such a result is\n\ninequitable and raises issues of judicial inefficiency for results that are likely to be\n\noverturned on appeal. Counsel did not find case authority saying that it is an abuse\n\nof discretion to deny a Motion for New Trial where: (1) discovery was interfered\n\nwith by the other side and (2) once discovery was obtained, it showed there were\n\nfact issues on all the elements in contention in the motion for summary judgment.\n\nHowever, this would be a narrow ruling, applicable only where there has been\n\ndiscovery interference, and it would follow guiding rules and principles to do equity\n\nand conserve judicial economy. For these reasons, the second denial of a Motion\n\nfor New Trial and Rehearing should be reversed, as should the First Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment.\n\nTHIRD ISSUE\n\n      The trial court’s grant of the No Evidence Summary Judgment (CR 97) was\n      harmful error because, at the time it was granted, the Fourth Amended\n      Petition (CR SUPP 492) was the live pleading, and Plaintiffs had raised a\n      fact issue of the elements of duty and causation (CR SUPP2 27) attacked by\n      Defendants’ Motion for No Evidence Summary Judgment. (CR SUPP\n      164).\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      Once a no-evidence motion for summary judgment is filed, the burden shifts\n\nto the non-moving party to present evidence raising an issue of material fact as to\n                                          19\n\fthe elements (duty and causation) specified in the motion. The evidence presented\n\nby the motion and response is reviewed in the light most favorable to the party\n\nagainst whom the summary judgment was rendered, crediting evidence favorable to\n\nthat party if reasonable jurors could and disregarding contrary evidence unless\n\nreasonable jurors could not.

Collateral Estoppel\n      The Fourth Amended Original Petition changed the previous pleadings by\n\nclaiming that the Defendants erred by building the pond counter to the plans\n\napproved by the City of Houston and Harris County.\n\n      Defendants in their No Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment claimed that\n\ncollateral estoppel applied to bar Plaintiff’s claims. The essential elements of\n\ncollateral estoppel are: the facts sought to be litigated in the second action were fully\n\nand fairly litigated in the prior action; those facts were essential to the judgment in\n\nthe first action, and the parties were cast as adversaries in the first action. Cole v.\n\nG.O.

App. – Fort Worth 1993, writ denied). To\n\nmake a determination whether the facts in a case were litigated, the court considers\n\nthe following facts: whether the parties were fully heard, whether the court supported\n\nits decision with reasoned opinion, and whether the decision was subject to appeal\n\n                                           20\n\for was in fact reviewed on appeal. Id. An ultimate issue essential to the judgment\n\ndoes not refer to a claim or cause of action, but to factual determinations submitted\n\nto the jury that are necessary to form a basis of judgment.

App. – Corpus Christi 1994, no writ).\n\n      The ultimate issue in the Fourth Amended Petition is that “Developer failed\n\nto build the Section 1 Detention Pond as per the plans that the Developer submitted\n\nto the City and County in 2001 and resubmitted in 2008 and the Defendants failed\n\nto reveal this to the new board members. (CR SUPP 497). This is a different fact\n\nthan having failed to build the pond to the plans submitted to BMUD. Therefore\n\ncollateral estoppel doesn’t apply.\n\n      Also, the facts in a case were not fully and fairly litigated. Mr. Conner testified\n\nthat he didn’t know if the plans were submitted to BMUD, but they were to the City.\n\n(CR SUPP 52). Other than that, there was no mention of plans submitted to the City\n\nand there has been no appeal until now. Collateral estoppel does not apply.\n\n      Comparison with the plans possibly approved by BMUD, (CR SUPP 74), the\n\nplans approved by the City did require a 3:1 slope, no sidewalk or fences. “The 2001\n\nand 2008 Plans that the Developer submitted to the City and County indicate that\n\nthere is a 3 to 1 slope around the pond…and the sidewalk and fence were not in the\n\nplans that the Developer submitted to the City and County in 2001 and 2008…before\n\nthe Section 1 Pond was completed the Defendant, Robert Hudson was made aware\n\n\n                                           21\n\fof the problem with the side slopes, fences and sidewalks, but he failed to correct\n\nthe problems. All of the Defendants failed to insure that the pond was built properly\n\nand their decisions regarded the pond protected the interests of the Developer and\n\nbenefitted the Developer financially.” (CR SUPP 498).\n\n   2. Duty & Causation Evidence\n\n      Because the discrepancy between the BMUD Plans and reality, and the\n\ndiscrepancy between the Houston/Harris County Plans and reality were the same,\n\nthe Court is directed to take judicial notice of the exhibits against summary judgment\n\nthat were presented with the Second Motion for Rehearing. (CR SUPP 50, et seq.)\n\nThese also function as exhibits against summary judgment on the Fourth Amended\n\nPetition.

App. – Corpus Christi 1985, no writ). To determine whether one has a duty\n\nnot to be grossly negligent, one looks at several interrelated factors, including the\n\nrisk, the foreseeability and the likelihood of injury weighed against the social utility\n\nof the actor’s conduct, the magnitude of the burden of guarding against the injury,\n\nand the consequences of placing the burden on the defendant…of all these factors,\n\nforeseeability of the risk is “the foremost and dominant consideration. Greater\n\nHouston Transp. Co., 801 S.W.2d at 525. Gross negligence includes two elements:\n\n(1) viewed objectively from the actor’s standpoint, the act or omission must involve\n\n\n                                          22\n\fan extreme degree of risk, considering the probability and magnitude of the potential\n\nharm to others, and (2) the actor must have actual, subjective awareness of the risk\n\ninvolved, but nevertheless proceed in conscious indifference to the rights, safety or\n\nwelfare of others.

There\n\nis no question that the Defendants, as Board Members knew that the Homeowners’\n\nAssociation faced an extreme degree of risk - $126,716 (CR SUPP 96) if the Board\n\ndid not fix the pond. It was foreseeable that they would actually have to pay extra\n\nmoney. (CR SUPP 54). Likewise,          the     Board   proceeded     with    conscious\n\nindifference not to make the repairs but to enter into an agreement where the\n\nhomeowners would be required to make the repairs. (CR SUPP 60). The Plaintiff\n\nhas raised more than a scintilla of evidence on the existence of duty and causation\n\nfor gross negligence.\n\n          Likewise, the Board had a duty not to commit willful misconduct. The\n\njust-discussed factors argue for a duty. Also, the utility of failing to correct the pond\n\nwas negative. (See, e.g. CR SUPP 61). And the burden on a developer could not\n\npossibly be as great as it would be on sixty-some-odd homeowners. The Plaintiff\n\nhas raised more than a scintilla of evidence of duty and causation on willful conduct.\n\n      Adopted herein by reference are the references to evidence by which Plaintiff\n\nraised more than a scintilla of an existence of duty and causation on the other causes\n\nof action. (See, infra, pp. 10-12).\n\n\n                                           23\n\fFOURTH ISSUE\n\n      The trial court’s award of $94,990.73 in indemnity was excessive, and\n      harmful error.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n    The Fourth Issue argues that fees are excessive for several reasons: (1) First\n\noff, no indemnity is owed at this time because Plaintiff has raised a fact issue on duty\n\nand causation in the Third Issue and less indemnity is owed because the First Issue\n\neliminated one of the claims on which summary judgment was attempted. Issues\n\nThree and Four should be sent back to the finder of fact in the trial court and, because\n\nthe indemnity agreement makes indemnity due only when it cannot be proven that\n\nDefendants did not commit gross negligence or willful acts, indemnity is premature.\n\nThus, the standard of review is de novo, and award of indemnity is premature.\n\n      Second, some of the fees were for work that was purely unnecessary. The\n\nstandard of review in remittitur cases is sufficiency of the evidence. Mission Park\n\nFuneral Chapel, Inc. v. Gallegos, No. 04-00-00459-CV, 2001 Tex. App. LEXIS\n\n2978 (Tex. App. – San Antonio May 9, 2001, no pet.).\n\n      Third, a multiplier of 0.5 should have been applied to the total bill because all\n\nthe Board member’s interests were identical and you should only have to do the same\n\nthing once for all three. The Developer was not entitled to indemnity. Again, the\n\nstandard of review in remittitur cases is sufficiency of the evidence. Id.\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\f      Finally, in some matters the Board members were not the prevailing party. I\n\ncould find no authority on this, but believe it to be a de novo review.\n\n\nARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES ON FOURTH ISSUE\n\n\n      A trial to the bench was had on indemnity. (RR1, RR2).\n      Section 5 of the Bylaws provides for indemnification as follows:\n       “The Association shall indemnify any Director, officer, or employee of the\nAssociation against expenses actually and necessarily incurred by him and any\namount paid in satisfaction of judgments in connection with any action, suit or\nproceedings, whether civil or criminal in nature, in which he is made a party by\nreason of being or having been a Director, officer or employee…except in relation\nto matters as to which he shall be judged in such action, suit or proceeding to be\nliable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of duty.” (CR\n27).\n      Because Plaintiff has taken steps in this appeal to overturn the No Evidence\n\nSummary Judgment on the issues of duty and causation for the causes of action of\n\ngross negligence and willful misconduct, it would be premature to indemnify any of\n\nthe Defendants. (Of course, by the terms of the Bylaws, the Developer is not eligible\n\nfor this indemnity.)\n\n      If such time comes as indemnity is an issue, there are other arguments against\n\nfull indemnity. Firstly, the interests for Robert Hudson, Claudia Hudson and Tiffany\n\nRoath were identical in this case. Plaintiff would argue that, like with jury charges\n\nand “strikes”, identical interests should be grouped together. Therefore, half of the\n\ntotal bill is reimburseable as indemnity and half is not because it is attributable to\n\n\n                                          25\n\fwork on the Developer’s behalf, an interest somewhat different from that of the\n\nBoard Members in that he may have done different acts and he is not eligible for\n\nindemnity.\n\n      Counsel for Defendant brought up the point that the judgment will be awarded\n\n“jointly and severally.” This is a red herring. What we are indemnifying is attorney\n\nlabor, quantified in hours, not payment of damages, as there presently are none. If\n\nPlaintiff is successful in its challenges and goes on to full trial, indemnification of a\n\njudgment may be an issue. But it is premature at this juncture. Therefore the\n\npossibility of joint and several damages has nothing to do with quantifying how\n\nmuch attorney labor was needed for what party.\n\n      Some of the labor expended simply wasn’t reasonable and necessary. Counsel\n\nfor Plaintiff testified to this at trial. (RR1). A total of $50,643.77 was not reasonable\n\nand necessary. Among items that were not reasonable and necessary are everything\n\nto do with a jury. A jury demand was made, (RR1 19-20), but no jury fee was ever\n\npaid. Defendants knew they weren’t having a jury, but counsel went on to do 22.35\n\nhrs (invoice 43332) on a jury charge and motion in limine. The Depositions on\n\nWritten Questions were for the benefit of the Developer (invoices 42975,\n\n43067)(RR1 23-32), so should not be paid to the Board Members. The amount of\n\ntime on invoice 43171 for a Motion for Summary Judgment was not reasonable\n\nbecause it was a simple motion with little research. (RR1 33). The Motion to Quash\n\n\n                                           26\n\fthe Conner Deposition was not necessary as Plaintiff still needed it for its rehearing\n\nand Defendants’ Counterclaim was on file. (RR1 37)(Invoice 43348). The Motion\n\nto Dismiss and Motion for Sanctions were not necessary. (RR1 40)(Invoice 43469,\n\n43559, 43676). Invoice 43412 only benefitted the developer. Rule 91a attorney’s\n\nfees are only awarded if you are successful, so they should not be awarded. (RR1\n\n41). The total amount of fees is $120,645.69. (RR1 55). Deducting those fees that\n\nwere not reasonable and necessary is: $120,645.69 - $ 50,643.77= $70,001.92.\n\nThen, by the apportionment formula discussed above, this should be $35.000.96 or\n\nhalf of the $70K to go toward indemnification. This Court should order a remittitur,\n\nif it orders any fees at all.\n\n\n                                CONCLUSION & PRAYER\n\n       This was a case where the Developer and the Developer’s hand-picked board\n\nmembers knew they had built a Detention Pond wrong and knew that they were\n\nsticking the homeowners for substantial extra costs. Through summary judgments\n\nlong before discovery had gotten off the ground they: (1) wrongfully got a first\n\nsummary judgment on grounds not addressed in the Motion; (2) defeated a motion\n\nfor new trial where the evidence showed that the first summary judgment shouldn’t\n\nhave been granted at all; (3) wrongfully got a no evidence summary judgment when\n\nthere was evidence of duty and causation; and (4) obtained an indemnity award for\n\nfar more than they deserved.\n                                         27\n\f      Plaintiff asks that the first summary judgment be reversed, the motion for new\n\ntrial be granted, the no evidence summary judgment be reversed, this case be\n\nreturned to the trial court for trial, and, if indemnity is still awarded, that it be for a\n\nmuch lower sum in keeping with reasonable and necessary fees. Plaintiff asks for\n\nsuch other and further relief as may be just.\n\n                                                 Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                 _____/s/ MB CHIMENE__________\n                                                 THE CHIMENE LAW FIRM\n                                                 Michele Barber Chimene\n                                                 TBN 04207500\n                                                 2827 Linkwood Dr.\n                                                 Houston, TX. 77025\n                                                 PH: 832 940-1471; no fax\n                                                 michelec@airmail.net\n\n\n                                                 LAW OFFICES OF M.
