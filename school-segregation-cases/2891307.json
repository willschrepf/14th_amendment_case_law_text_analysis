They all claim to be members of the Church of the New Song (CONS) at ISP.\nCONS was founded in the early 1970s by a federal prisoner named Harry Theriault.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fThough Theriault testified that CONS was initially established as a \"game,\" Theriault\nv. Carlson, 339 F. Supp. 375, 377 (N.D. Ga. 1972), vacated, 495 F.2d 390 (5th Cir.\n1974), in that case CONS was recognized as a religion protected by the First\nAmendment. After a \"trial run\" in federal penal institutions in Georgia and Texas,\nhowever, a federal district court in Texas determined that CONS was \"not . . . a\nreligion, but rather . . . a masquerade designed to obtain First Amendment protection\nfor acts which otherwise would be unlawful and/or reasonably disallowed by the\nvarious prison authorities but for the attempts . . . to classify them as 'religious' and,\ntherefore, presumably protected by the First Amendment.\" Theriault v. Silber, 453\nF. Supp. 254, 260, 261 (W.D. Tex.), appeal dismissed, 579 F.2d 302 (5th Cir. 1978),\ncert. denied, 440 U.S. 917 (1979). In contrast, this Court in 1974 recognized CONS\nas a religion protected by the First Amendment and upheld a district court's order\nmandating its equal treatment with other religions at the prison. Remmers v. Brewer,\n494 F.2d 1277 (8th Cir.) (per curiam), aff'g 361 F. Supp. 537 (S.D. Iowa 1973), cert.\ndenied, 419 U.S. 1012 (1974).1 Because of the Remmers decision, we suspend\ndisbelief and proceed on the assumption, mandated by Remmers, that CONS is a\nreligion.\n\n       The current controversy arose when ISP officials refused to permit food trays\nprepared for CONS' \"celebration of life\" banquet to be taken to CONS members who\nwere in lock-up at the time of the banquet. Plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 (2000) claiming that ISP officials had violated their First Amendment rights\nand were in contempt of the decree set forth in Remmers. Defendants, all prison\nofficials, counterclaimed and sought a declaratory judgment to prevent plaintiffs from\n\n\n\n      1\n        We note that in Remmers the district court relied heavily on the Georgia\nfederal district court's opinion in Theriault v. Carlson, 339 F. Supp. 375, 377 (N.D.\nGa. 1972), vacated, 495 F.2d 390 (5th Cir. 1974). At the time our Court affirmed the\ndistrict court's decision in Remmers, Theriault had not yet been vacated by the Fifth\nCircuit.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fparticipating in CONS activities.2 The District Court denied the counterclaim and\nentered an order requiring defendants to permit CONS inmates in lock-up to receive\ntrays of food from the banquet. Defendants appeal both the entry of the order and the\ndenial of declaratory relief. Plaintiffs cross-appeal the District Court's decision to\nallow certain evidence to be admitted under seal and to enter an order protective of\nconfidential informants.\n\n                                           I.\n\n       In order to present a valid First Amendment claim against ISP officials,\nplaintiffs have the burden of establishing that the alleged religious belief or ritual in\nquestion—here the receipt of food from a feast for the \"celebration of life\"—is based\non a teaching of the CONS religion, that their belief in the teaching is sincerely held,\nand that the governmental action in question actually infringes upon the individual\nprisoners' free exercise of this belief. Hamilton v. Schriro, 74 F.3d 1545, 1550 (8th\nCir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 874 (1996). In its first order, the District Court found\nthat the \"celebration of life\" feast was rooted in religion and thus was a religious\nbelief protected under the First Amendment. Our review of such a finding is for clear\nerror. Iron Eyes v. Henry, 907 F.2d 810, 813 (8th Cir. 1990). Because there is\ninsufficient evidence in the record to show that CONS instructs its adherents to hold\nsuch a feast, we conclude the District Court clearly erred in finding that the\nrequirement of a feast for the \"celebration of life\" is a belief rooted in the CONS\nreligion.\n\n       The record is filled with conflicting testimony by plaintiffs regarding the\nsignificance of the \"celebration of life\" feast in the CONS religion. Plaintiffs first\n\n\n      2\n        Defendants have not asserted a claim that Remmers should be overruled, even\nthough new evidence appears to be available to show that CONS is a sham religion\nthat exists only in the prison context and serves as a cover for gang activity.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fclaimed that a feast was required for \"a Spring Celebration in honor of nature's\nrenewal of life.\" (Appellants' App. at 61). Plaintiffs then asserted that the\n\"celebration of life\" commemorated the day on which the CONS was founded.\nFinally, plaintiffs contended that it was one and the same as the Sacred Unity Feast\nreferenced in the Paratestament, a partial text of which is the sole written statement\nof CONS theology and ritual that the record in this case contains.3 Given plaintiffs'\nconflicting accounts of the meaning of the celebration, it is difficult to credit the\nclaim that the \"celebration of life\" feast is rooted in the CONS religion. The District\nCourt's finding that it was so rooted was premised upon its clearly erroneous\nsubsidiary finding that the celebration has direct support in the Paratestament. The\ncourt arrived at this finding by accepting plaintiffs' argument that the \"celebration of\nlife\" feast is one and the same as the Sacred Unity Feast.\n\n        Having read the portions of the Paratestament that the record on appeal\ncontains with some care, we conclude that without doubt the Sacred Unity Feast is\nnot one and the same as the \"celebration of life\" feast, which all sides appear to agree\nis not mentioned as such in the Paratestament. According to the Paratestament, after\n\"the [h]undred and forty-four thousand Revelation ministers have been sealed as\nprophesied\" there will \"be held a supper of the great God.\" (Id. at 240). It is only\nafter the sealing4 of these thousands of Revelation ministers that the Sacred Unity\nFeast is to become an annual occurrence: \"After this, each year on the same date the\nSeminary of the Fountainhead5 in all purlieus will hold the Annual Sacred Unity Feast\n. . . .\" (Id. at 241). Plaintiffs point to this reference to the Sacred Unity Feast as\nsupport for their annual \"celebration of life,\" but it is apparent that the Sacred Unity\n\n\n      3\n       Indeed, the record on appeal contains only thirteen pages of the Paratestament.\nInternal page numbers suggest the entire document is considerably longer.\n      4\n          We do not pause to delve into the meaning of \"sealing\" in this context.\n      5\n          Similarly, we do not pause to inquire into the makeup of the \"Seminary.\"\n\n                                           -6-\n\fFeast is to be held only after the hundred and forty-four thousand Revelation\nministers have been sealed. There is no evidence to show that this condition\nprecedent has been satisfied. Inasmuch as the \"celebration of life\" is not mentioned\nanywhere in any CONS text to which our attention has been directed, partaking of a\nbanquet for the \"celebration of life\" cannot be regarded as the exercise of a prescribed\nritual of the CONS religion. Accordingly, the prison officials did not violate the\nplaintiffs' First Amendment rights by denying banquet trays to CONS members in\nlock-up. If a sincerely-held belief was implicated, it was not a belief grounded in\nCONS theology or its prescribed rituals as revealed by the materials the parties have\nput forward for our examination.\n\n       Even assuming arguendo that CONS somehow ordains a special \"celebration\nof life\" banquet, ISP's ban on providing trays of food to CONS members in lock-up\ndoes not violate any prisoner's free-exercise rights. Prison regulations may infringe\nupon prisoners' constitutional rights so long as such regulations are reasonably related\nto legitimate penological interests. Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987). There\nmust be a rational connection between the challenged regulation and the interest put\nforth to justify it. Id. Three other relevant factors are (1) the continued availability\nof other means of exercising the right, (2) the effect that accommodation of the right\nwould have on other prisoners, on prison staff, and on prison resources, and (3) the\nexistence of ready alternatives to the challenged regulation. Id. at 90. We review de\nnovo a district court's application of Turner to the facts before it. Iron Eyes, 907 F.2d\nat 813. We must accord great deference to the judgment of prison officials,\nparticularly with respect to decisions that implicate institutional security. Turner, 482\nU.S. at 84–85; Iron Eyes, 907 F.2d at 812.\n\n       Defendants argue that they prohibited special trays of food from being taken\ninto the lock-up unit in order to keep contraband out of the unit. A security director\nat the prison testified that health regulations prevented staff from thoroughly\nsearching the food trays to ensure that they were not being used to deliver contraband.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fThe concern about contraband is particularly acute with respect to banquet food for\nthe \"celebration of life\" because CONS members have previously sent contraband\ninto the lock-up unit through a variety of illicit methods. We have recognized\ninstitutional security as \"the most compelling governmental interest in a prison\nsetting.\" Ochs v. Thalacker, 90 F.3d 293, 296 (8th Cir. 1996). In the present case,\nthere is a rational connection between the ban on permitting food trays from the\nCONS banquet to be taken to CONS members in lock-up and the governmental\ninterest in maintaining prison security by adopting measures designed to keep\ncontraband items out of the lock-up unit.\n\n       Similarly, the other three Turner factors support the finding that the ban was\nreasonably related to the legitimate penological interest of preserving institutional\nsecurity. First, although the District Court found that denying trays of banquet food\nto CONS members in lock-up \"effectively denies them any opportunity to participate\nin the Celebration of Life feast,\" the Court framed the issue too narrowly. Thus, its\nfinding misses the point. The critical question for Turner purposes is whether the\nprison officials' actions deny prisoners their free-exercise rights without leaving open\nsufficient alternative avenues for religious exercise. See, e.g., Iron Eyes, 907 F.2d at\n815 (noting that Turner balance favors prison officials when regulation does not\npreclude inmates from practicing at least some of the tenets of their religion). There\nis nothing in the record showing that CONS mandates any particular menu for the\n\"celebration of life\" feast, so lock-up inmates apparently can commemorate the event\nwith their ordinary prison meals. Furthermore, members in lock-up continue to be\nable to practice other CONS beliefs despite not being able to partake of the banquet\nfood.\n\n       Turning to another Turner factor, permitting special trays of food to be taken\nto lock-up burdens prison resources by increasing the demands on staff time because\nof the necessity of searching such trays for contraband. Finally, there do not exist\nready alternatives to the challenged ban. Thorough searches of the banquet food\n\n                                          -8-\n\fwould not only burden prison staff but also might run afoul of health regulations.\nAdditionally, there is the inherent difficulty of searching trays of food thoroughly for\nsmall items of contraband hidden in the food itself. Moreover, banquet foods may by\ntheir very nature contain contraband items such as bones, which are banned from the\nlock-up unit because of the danger they may be fashioned into weapons.\n\n\n\n       Under our deferential review of prison administrators' actions, all of the Turner\nfactors favor the conclusion that the ban on delivering food trays from the\n\"celebration of life\" banquet to CONS members in lock-up is reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests, and thus there is no impermissible infringement on\nthe free-exercise rights of any CONS member. The denial of \"celebration of life\"\nfood trays to CONS adherents in lock-up therefore does not violate the Remmers\ninjunction.\n\n                                          II.\n\n       We deal next with plaintiffs' challenge to the District Court's decision to allow\ncertain evidence, including depositions from confidential prison informants, to be\nreceived into evidence under seal and pursuant to a protective order that barred\ndisclosure of the substance of the testimony or the deponents' identities to plaintiffs\nand the public. We are satisfied the court did not abuse its discretion in this regard.\nAny right of access to records from civil proceedings, if it exists (a question we never\nhave decided), is not absolute. Webster Groves Sch. Dist. v. Pulitzer Publ'g Co., 898\nF.2d 1371, 1376 (8th Cir. 1990); see also In re Search Warrant for Secretarial Area\nOutside Office of Gunn, 855 F.2d 569, 574 (8th Cir. 1988). A compelling\ngovernmental interest permits a court to take evidence under seal as long as the court\nmakes specific findings regarding the necessity of such a step. Gunn, 855 F.2d at\n574. Here, the District Court found that the preservation of institutional security and\nthe protection of confidential informants from acts of retaliation for giving evidence\n\n                                          -9-\n\fwere compelling interests necessitating the decision to issue a protective order and\nseal portions of the record. Cf. Brown v. Kuhlmann, 142 F.3d 529, 537–38 (2d Cir.\n1998) (recognizing preservation of undercover officer's safety as a compelling\ninterest sufficient to permit closure of courtroom during officer's testimony). We note\nthat only a minor portion of the evidence has been sealed as a result of the challenged\nruling. Furthermore, this evidence was sealed only after it was determined that\nredaction would be insufficient to protect prison security and informant safety.\nAccordingly, we sustain the challenged ruling. Cf. Rodriguez v. Schneider, No.\n00-0307, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 2458 (2d Cir. Feb. 11, 2003) (prison inmate not\nentitled to information regarding confidential informants in order to buttress a\nretaliation claim under § 1983).\n\n                                          III.\n\n       Finally, we turn to defendants' claim that the District Court's dismissal of their\nrequest for declaratory relief should be reversed. Specifically, the defendants'\ncounterclaim asked the court for a declaration that would allow prison officials to bar\nall plaintiffs from participating in CONS services, study groups, lay ministry, and\nbanquets. We find no abuse of discretion in the District Court's dismissal of the\nrequested declaration. First, such a declaration would likely fail under Turner\nbecause of its breadth; it would leave inmates with few avenues for the free exercise\nof the CONS religion. Cf. Ward v. Walsh, 1 F.3d 873, 878 (9th Cir. 1993) (noting\nthat leaving an inmate with the ability to pray privately and no other means of\nexercising his beliefs probably would not be sufficient under Turner to constitute\nadequate alternative methods of exercising the right to religion), cert. denied, 510\nU.S. 1192 (1994). Second, and alone dispositive of the counterclaim, we believe that\nsuch a broad declaration cannot issue so long as our Court's decision in Remmers,\nwhich holds that CONS is a religion entitled to protection under the First\nAmendment, continues to be the law of our Circuit. Prison officials may not bypass\nRemmers by asking for this form of declaratory relief. The proper procedural\n\n                                          -10-\n\fmechanism for attacking Remmers is to bring a motion to dissolve the injunction\nentered in that case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). This Court specifically approved\nthat portion of the district court's decision in Remmers that left the finding that CONS\nis a religion protected under the First Amendment subject to later challenge by ISP\nofficials. Remmers, 494 F.2d at 1278 n.1 (\"As the trial court noted, should it\nsubsequently appear that [CONS] is a hoax and front . . . that eventually can be dealt\nwith by both the prison administration and the court.\").\n\n       We note that ISP officials have previously attempted to reopen the issue of\nwhether CONS is a religion entitled to First Amendment protection, but these\nattempts were rejected by the district court, which determined that ISP officials had\nnot presented sufficient evidence that CONS was a \"hoax and front\" at ISP. See\nLoney v. Scurr, 474 F. Supp. 1186 (S.D. Iowa 1979); Remmers v. Brewer, 396\nF. Supp. 145 (S.D. Iowa 1975), aff'd, 529 F.2d 656 (8th Cir. 1976). Defendant prison\nofficials now appear to have gathered substantial evidence that CONS functions not\nas a religious organization but as a racist prison gang within ISP. Such evidence\nobviously would be highly relevant to a determination regarding the continued\nvalidity of the Remmers decision.6\n\n\n\n\n      6\n        ISP officials have designated CONS as a \"security threat group\" within the\nprison. (Appellants' App. at 119, 255). Such a group is defined to be \"any ongoing\norganization, group, or association that threatens or coerces or harasses others and/or\nparticipates in or encourages illegal activity.\" (Id.) We note that the Third Circuit\nhas recently upheld the authority of prison administrators to designate purportedly\nreligious organizations as security threat groups and limit their activities within\nprison. Fraise v. Terhune, 283 F.3d 506, 509 (3d Cir. 2002); see also In re Long\nTerm Admin. Segregation of Inmates Designated as Five Percenters (Mickle v.\nMoore), 174 F.3d 464, 466 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 874 (1999).\n\n                                         -11-\n\f                                          IV.\n\n       In sum, we reverse the District Court's order requiring prison officials to permit\nfood trays from the \"celebration of life\" banquet to be taken to CONS members in\nlock-up. We affirm the District Court's denial of defendants' counterclaim for\ndeclaratory relief and the District Court's decision to partially seal the record and to\nissue a protective order.\n                        ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f",

In its first order, the District Court found\nthat the \"celebration of life\" feast was rooted in religion and thus was a religious\nbelief protected under the First Amendment. Our review of such a finding is for clear\nerror. Iron Eyes v. Henry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544316\"><a href=\"/opinion/544316/robert-iron-eyes-v-dan-henry-assistant-superintendent-individually-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 813 (8th Cir. 1990). Because there is\ninsufficient evidence in the record to show that CONS instructs its adherents to hold\nsuch a feast, we conclude the District Court clearly erred in finding that the\nrequirement of a feast for the \"celebration of life\" is a belief rooted in the CONS\nreligion.\n\n       The record is filled with conflicting testimony by plaintiffs regarding the\nsignificance of the \"celebration of life\" feast in the CONS religion. Plaintiffs first\n\n\n      2\n        Defendants have not asserted a claim that Remmers should be overruled, even\nthough new evidence appears to be available to show that CONS is a sham religion\nthat exists only in the prison context and serves as a cover for gang activity.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fclaimed that a feast was required for \"a Spring Celebration in honor of nature's\nrenewal of life.\" (Appellants' App. at 61). Plaintiffs then asserted that the\n\"celebration of life\" commemorated the day on which the CONS was founded.\nFinally, plaintiffs contended that it was one and the same as the Sacred Unity Feast\nreferenced in the Paratestament, a partial text of which is the sole written statement\nof CONS theology and ritual that the record in this case contains.3 Given plaintiffs'\nconflicting accounts of the meaning of the celebration, it is difficult to credit the\nclaim that the \"celebration of life\" feast is rooted in the CONS religion. The District\nCourt's finding that it was so rooted was premised upon its clearly erroneous\nsubsidiary finding that the celebration has direct support in the Paratestament. The\ncourt arrived at this finding by accepting plaintiffs' argument that the \"celebration of\nlife\" feast is one and the same as the Sacred Unity Feast.\n\n        Having read the portions of the Paratestament that the record on appeal\ncontains with some care, we conclude that without doubt the Sacred Unity Feast is\nnot one and the same as the \"celebration of life\" feast, which all sides appear to agree\nis not mentioned as such in the Paratestament. According to the Paratestament, after\n\"the [h]undred and forty-four thousand Revelation ministers have been sealed as\nprophesied\" there will \"be held a supper of the great God.\" (Id. at 240). It is only\nafter the sealing4 of these thousands of Revelation ministers that the Sacred Unity\nFeast is to become an annual occurrence: \"After this, each year on the same date the\nSeminary of the Fountainhead5 in all purlieus will hold the Annual Sacred Unity Feast\n. . . .\" (Id. at 241). Plaintiffs point to this reference to the Sacred Unity Feast as\nsupport for their annual \"celebration of life,\" but it is apparent that the Sacred Unity\n\n\n      3\n       Indeed, the record on appeal contains only thirteen pages of the Paratestament.\nInternal page numbers suggest the entire document is considerably longer.\n      4\n          We do not pause to delve into the meaning of \"sealing\" in this context.\n      5\n          Similarly, we do not pause to inquire into the makeup of the \"Seminary.\"\n\n                                           -6-\n\fFeast is to be held only after the hundred and forty-four thousand Revelation\nministers have been sealed. There is no evidence to show that this condition\nprecedent has been satisfied. Inasmuch as the \"celebration of life\" is not mentioned\nanywhere in any CONS text to which our attention has been directed, partaking of a\nbanquet for the \"celebration of life\" cannot be regarded as the exercise of a prescribed\nritual of the CONS religion. Accordingly, the prison officials did not violate the\nplaintiffs' First Amendment rights by denying banquet trays to CONS members in\nlock-up. If a sincerely-held belief was implicated, it was not a belief grounded in\nCONS theology or its prescribed rituals as revealed by the materials the parties have\nput forward for our examination.\n\n       Even assuming arguendo that CONS somehow ordains a special \"celebration\nof life\" banquet, ISP's ban on providing trays of food to CONS members in lock-up\ndoes not violate any prisoner's free-exercise rights. Prison regulations may infringe\nupon prisoners' constitutional rights so long as such regulations are reasonably related\nto legitimate penological interests. Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89 (1987). There\nmust be a rational connection between the challenged regulation and the interest put\nforth to justify it. Id. Three other relevant factors are (1) the continued availability\nof other means of exercising the right, (2) the effect that accommodation of the right\nwould have on other prisoners, on prison staff, and on prison resources, and (3) the\nexistence of ready alternatives to the challenged regulation. Id. at 90. We review de\nnovo a district court's application of Turner to the facts before it. Iron Eyes, 907 F.2d\nat 813. We must accord great deference to the judgment of prison officials,\nparticularly with respect to decisions that implicate institutional security. Turner, 482\nU.S. at 84–85; Iron Eyes, 907 F.2d at 812.\n\n       Defendants argue that they prohibited special trays of food from being taken\ninto the lock-up unit in order to keep contraband out of the unit. A security director\nat the prison testified that health regulations prevented staff from thoroughly\nsearching the food trays to ensure that they were not being used to deliver contraband.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fThe concern about contraband is particularly acute with respect to banquet food for\nthe \"celebration of life\" because CONS members have previously sent contraband\ninto the lock-up unit through a variety of illicit methods. We have recognized\ninstitutional security as \"the most compelling governmental interest in a prison\nsetting.\" Ochs v. Thalacker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722464\"><a href=\"/opinion/722464/donald-duane-ochs-v-john-a-thalacker-warden-iowa-mens-reformatory-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 296 (8th Cir. 1996). In the present case,\nthere is a rational connection between the ban on permitting food trays from the\nCONS banquet to be taken to CONS members in lock-up and the governmental\ninterest in maintaining prison security by adopting measures designed to keep\ncontraband items out of the lock-up unit.\n\n       Similarly, the other three Turner factors support the finding that the ban was\nreasonably related to the legitimate penological interest of preserving institutional\nsecurity. First, although the District Court found that denying trays of banquet food\nto CONS members in lock-up \"effectively denies them any opportunity to participate\nin the Celebration of Life feast,\" the Court framed the issue too narrowly. Thus, its\nfinding misses the point. The critical question for Turner purposes is whether the\nprison officials' actions deny prisoners their free-exercise rights without leaving open\nsufficient alternative avenues for religious exercise. See, e.g., Iron Eyes, 907 F.2d at\n815 (noting that Turner balance favors prison officials when regulation does not\npreclude inmates from practicing at least some of the tenets of their religion). There\nis nothing in the record showing that CONS mandates any particular menu for the\n\"celebration of life\" feast, so lock-up inmates apparently can commemorate the event\nwith their ordinary prison meals. Furthermore, members in lock-up continue to be\nable to practice other CONS beliefs despite not being able to partake of the banquet\nfood.\n\n       Turning to another Turner factor, permitting special trays of food to be taken\nto lock-up burdens prison resources by increasing the demands on staff time because\nof the necessity of searching such trays for contraband. Finally, there do not exist\nready alternatives to the challenged ban. Thorough searches of the banquet food\n\n                                          -8-\n\fwould not only burden prison staff but also might run afoul of health regulations.\nAdditionally, there is the inherent difficulty of searching trays of food thoroughly for\nsmall items of contraband hidden in the food itself. Moreover, banquet foods may by\ntheir very nature contain contraband items such as bones, which are banned from the\nlock-up unit because of the danger they may be fashioned into weapons.\n\n\n\n       Under our deferential review of prison administrators' actions, all of the Turner\nfactors favor the conclusion that the ban on delivering food trays from the\n\"celebration of life\" banquet to CONS members in lock-up is reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests, and thus there is no impermissible infringement on\nthe free-exercise rights of any CONS member. The denial of \"celebration of life\"\nfood trays to CONS adherents in lock-up therefore does not violate the Remmers\ninjunction.\n\n                                          II.\n\n       We deal next with plaintiffs' challenge to the District Court's decision to allow\ncertain evidence, including depositions from confidential prison informants, to be\nreceived into evidence under seal and pursuant to a protective order that barred\ndisclosure of the substance of the testimony or the deponents' identities to plaintiffs\nand the public. We are satisfied the court did not abuse its discretion in this regard.\nAny right of access to records from civil proceedings, if it exists (a question we never\nhave decided), is not absolute.

A compelling\ngovernmental interest permits a court to take evidence under seal as long as the court\nmakes specific findings regarding the necessity of such a step. Gunn, 855 F.2d at\n574. Here, the District Court found that the preservation of institutional security and\nthe protection of confidential informants from acts of retaliation for giving evidence\n\n                                          -9-\n\fwere compelling interests necessitating the decision to issue a protective order and\nseal portions of the record. Cf. Brown v. Kuhlmann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754040\"><a href=\"/opinion/754040/andre-brown-v-robert-kuhlmann-superintendent-of-sullivan-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537–38 (2d Cir.\n1998) (recognizing preservation of undercover officer's safety as a compelling\ninterest sufficient to permit closure of courtroom during officer's testimony). We note\nthat only a minor portion of the evidence has been sealed as a result of the challenged\nruling. Furthermore, this evidence was sealed only after it was determined that\nredaction would be insufficient to protect prison security and informant safety.\nAccordingly, we sustain the challenged ruling. Cf. Rodriguez v. Schneider, No.\n00-0307, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. App. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">2458</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. Feb. 11, 2003) (prison inmate not\nentitled to information regarding confidential informants in order to buttress a\nretaliation claim under § 1983).\n\n                                          III.\n\n       Finally, we turn to defendants' claim that the District Court's dismissal of their\nrequest for declaratory relief should be reversed. Specifically, the defendants'\ncounterclaim asked the court for a declaration that would allow prison officials to bar\nall plaintiffs from participating in CONS services, study groups, lay ministry, and\nbanquets. We find no abuse of discretion in the District Court's dismissal of the\nrequested declaration. First, such a declaration would likely fail under Turner\nbecause of its breadth; it would leave inmates with few avenues for the free exercise\nof the CONS religion. Cf. Ward v. Walsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627445\"><a href=\"/opinion/627445/jason-mckinley-ward-v-jessie-walsh-associate-warden-of-programs/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 878 (9th Cir. 1993) (noting\nthat leaving an inmate with the ability to pray privately and no other means of\nexercising his beliefs probably would not be sufficient under Turner to constitute\nadequate alternative methods of exercising the right to religion), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994). Second, and alone dispositive of the counterclaim, we believe that\nsuch a broad declaration cannot issue so long as our Court's decision in Remmers,\nwhich holds that CONS is a religion entitled to protection under the First\nAmendment, continues to be the law of our Circuit. Prison officials may not bypass\nRemmers by asking for this form of declaratory relief. The proper procedural\n\n                                          -10-\n\fmechanism for attacking Remmers is to bring a motion to dissolve the injunction\nentered in that case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). This Court specifically approved\nthat portion of the district court's decision in Remmers that left the finding that CONS\nis a religion protected under the First Amendment subject to later challenge by ISP\nofficials. Remmers, 494 F.2d at 1278 n.1 (\"As the trial court noted, should it\nsubsequently appear that [CONS] is a hoax and front . . . that eventually can be dealt\nwith by both the prison administration and the court.\").\n\n       We note that ISP officials have previously attempted to reopen the issue of\nwhether CONS is a religion entitled to First Amendment protection, but these\nattempts were rejected by the district court, which determined that ISP officials had\nnot presented sufficient evidence that CONS was a \"hoax and front\" at ISP. See\nLoney v. Scurr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1964528\"><a href=\"/opinion/1964528/loney-v-scurr/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Defendant prison\nofficials now appear to have gathered substantial evidence that CONS functions not\nas a religious organization but as a racist prison gang within ISP. Such evidence\nobviously would be highly relevant to a determination regarding the continued\nvalidity of the Remmers decision.6\n\n\n\n\n      6\n        ISP officials have designated CONS as a \"security threat group\" within the\nprison. (Appellants' App. at 119, 255). Such a group is defined to be \"any ongoing\norganization, group, or association that threatens or coerces or harasses others and/or\nparticipates in or encourages illegal activity.\" (Id.) We note that the Third Circuit\nhas recently upheld the authority of prison administrators to designate purportedly\nreligious organizations as security threat groups and limit their activities within\nprison.
