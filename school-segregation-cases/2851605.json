Coar, Judge.\n\n\nArgued February 11, 2000--Decided July 24, 2000\n\n\n\n Before Posner, Chief Judge, and Manion and Kanne,\nCircuit Judges.\n\n Posner, Chief Judge. The plaintiff, who worked as\na teller for the defendant bank between April\n1994 and February 1996, brought suit against the\nbank and related entities unnecessary to discuss\ncharging violations of the Family and Medical\nLeave Act, 29 U.S.C. sec.sec. 2601 et seq., the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. sec.\n2000e(k), and the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29\nU.S.C. sec.sec. 206(a), 207(a), 215(a)(2). There\nwere other charges as well, but they have fallen\nby the wayside. The defendant made an offer of\njudgment of $1,152 on the FLSA count (which\nsought overtime pay), and this was accepted. The\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for the\ndefendant on the other counts. The plaintiff then\nsought almost $35,000 in costs and attorneys’\nfees under the FLSA, which the judge cut down to\n$6,216. The appeals challenge both the dismissal\nof the FMLA and PDA counts and the reduction in\nthe amount of fees awarded for the successful\nprosecution of the FLSA count.\n\n The plaintiff had a problem of absenteeism. The\nbank required her to attend a \"coaching session\"\nto help her overcome the problem. That was in\nAugust 1995. The problem continued and on January\n26, 1996, roughly three weeks after she had\nbecome pregnant, she received a written warning\nabout her excessive absences. She received a\n\fsecond such warning on February 12 and a third on\nFebruary 21. All to no avail; she was AWOL again\non February 23 and 24 and was fired two days\nlater.\n\n Of a total of 20 unexcused absences between\nMarch 6, 1995, and the date of her discharge,\nnine occurred after she became pregnant, and she\nattributes these absences to severe morning\nsickness, although there is little medical\nsubstantiation of this attribution. On January 8,\n1996, shortly after she became pregnant, she\nrequested leave under the FMLA on the basis of\nher morning sickness. The defendant did not\nrespond to the request, and this nonresponse is\nthe basis of her FMLA claim. Although it is\nconceded that she did not satisfy the requirement\nfor eligibility for leave under the Act that she\nhave worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12\nmonths preceding the day on which she wanted to\ntake family leave, 29 U.S.C. sec. 2611(2)(A)(ii)\n(it is unclear by how much she fell short), she\nappeals to a regulation of the Department of\nLabor that waives statutory eligibility in cases\nin which the employer fails to respond promptly\nto a request for family leave. The regulation\nprovides, so far as bears on this case, that \"if\nthe employer fails to advise the employee whether\nthe employee is eligible [for family leave] prior\nto the date the requested leave is to commence,\nthe employee will be deemed eligible.\" 29 C.F.R.\nsec. 825.110(d).\n\n As several district courts have found (there are\nno appellate decisions), the regulation is\ninvalid. E.g., McQuain v. Ebner Furnaces, Inc.,\n55 F. Supp. 2d 763, 773-76 (N.D. Ohio 1999);\nSeaman v. Downtown Partnership of Baltimore,\nInc., 991 F. Supp. 751, 754 (D. Md. 1998); Wolke\nv. Dreadnought Marine, Inc., 954 F. Supp. 1133,\n1135-38 (E.D. Va. 1997). Although the Department\nof Labor has, like other administrative agencies,\nthe authority to issue regulations to carry out\nthe duties that Congress has assigned to it in\nthe Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. sec.\n2654, it has no authority to change the Act. But\nthat is what the regulation tries to do. It does\nnot address an interpretive issue that the\nstatute leaves open, and so the principle of the\nChevron case is not in play. E.g., Chevron\nU.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, 467 U.S. 837, 842-44 (1984); INS v.\nAguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 424-25 (1999);\nNLRB. v. GranCare, Inc., 170 F.3d 662, 666 (7th\nCir. 1999) (en banc); City of Chicago v. FCC, 199\nF.3d 424, 428 (7th Cir. 1999). The statutory text\nis perfectly clear and covers the issue. The\nright of family leave is conferred only on\nemployees who have worked at least 1,250 hours in\nthe previous 12 months. Yet under the regulation\n\fa worker who had worked 8 hours before seeking\nfamily leave would be entitled to family leave if\nthe employer neglected to inform the employee\npromptly that he or she was ineligible. And this\nregardless of whether the employee had incurred\nany detriment as a result of the employer’s\nsilence.\n\n The last point is critical. If detrimental\nreliance were required, the regulation could be\nunderstood as creating a right of estoppel\n(specifically a right to estop, that is, forbid,\nthe employer to raise a defense of ineligibility\nfor the statutory benefits), and such a right\nmight be thought both consistent with the statute\nand a reasonable method of implementing it, and\nso within the Department’s rulemaking powers.\nLike other equitable doctrines, the doctrine of\nestoppel is invoked in a variety of statutory\ncontexts without reference to particular\nstatutory language. True, if the statute creates\nor excludes a right to plead estoppel, the\ncreative power of the administering court or\nagency is suspended. But there is nothing in the\nFamily Leave and Medical Act that relates to\nmisleading eligibility notices or absences of\nnotice; so far as notice is concerned, the\nstatute merely requires the employer to post a\ngeneral summary of the Act in the workplace. 26\nU.S.C. sec. 2619. We do not read this provision\nto exclude the application of the doctrine of an\nestoppel in an appropriate case. And so an\nemployer who by his silence misled an employee\nconcerning the employee’s entitlement to family\nleave might, if the employee reasonably relied\nand was harmed as a result, be estopped to plead\nthe defense of ineligibility to the employee’s\nclaim of entitlement to family leave. See, e.g.,\nRager v. Dade Behring, Inc., 210 F.3d 776, 778-79\n(7th Cir. 2000); Athmer v. C.E.I. Equipment Co.,\n121 F.3d 294, 296-97 (7th Cir. 1997); General\nElectric Capital Corp. v. Armadora, S.A., 37 F.3d\n41, 45 (2d Cir. 1994).\n\n The plaintiff has made no effort to establish\nthe elements of an estoppel, however, and anyway\nthe regulation on which she relies to avoid the\n1,250-hours requirement is not limited to\ncircumstances in which an employer might be\nestopped to deny eligibility because his conduct\nhad induced detrimental reliance by the employee.\nThe regulation allows an employee to claim\nbenefits to which she is not entitled as a matter\nof law or equity, thus conferring a windfall by\nextinguishing the employer’s defense without any\nbasis in legal principle. The challenged\nregulation is not only unauthorized; it is\nunreasonable.\n\nWe move on to the plaintiff’s claim under the\n\fPregnancy Discrimination Act. The Act forbids\ndiscrimination against an employee on account of\nher being pregnant, and of such discrimination\nthe only evidence in this case, evidence that\nfalls short of making out a case that can\nwithstand summary judgment for the employer, is\nsome ugly comments about the plaintiff’s\npregnancy made by an employee who was not in the\nchain of command of the plaintiff and did not (so\nfar as appears) influence in any way the decision\nto fire her. \"The fact that someone who is not\ninvolved in the employment decision of which the\nplaintiff complains expressed discriminatory\nfeelings is not evidence that the decision had a\ndiscriminatory motivation.\" Hunt v. City of\nMarkham, No. 99-1331, 2000 WL 968540, at *2 (7th\nCir. July 11, 2000) (emphasis in original).\nCompare Sheehan v. Donlen Corp., 173 F.3d 1039,\n1044-45 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n The plaintiff was fired because of her\nabsenteeism, not because of her pregnancy. There\nwas a relation, insofar as some of the absences\nmay have been due to morning sickness, which was,\nof course, a consequence of her pregnancy. But\nthe Pregnancy Discrimination Act does not protect\na pregnant employee from being discharged for\nbeing absent from work even if her absence is due\nto pregnancy or to complications of pregnancy,\nunless the absences of nonpregnant employees are\noverlooked. Troupe v. May Dept. Stores Co., 20\nF.3d 734, 738-39 (7th Cir. 1994); Marshall v.\nAmerican Hospital Ass’n, 157 F.3d 520, 526 (7th\nCir. 1998); Armindo v. Padlocker, Inc., 209 F.3d\n1319 (11th Cir. 2000) (per curiam); In re\nCarnegie Center Associates, 129 F.3d 290, 296-97\n(3d Cir. 1997); Fisher v. Vassar College, 70 F.3d\n1420, 1448 (1995) reheard en banc on other\ngrounds, 114 F.3d 1332 (2d Cir. 1997). And of\nthat there is no evidence.\n\n It might seem that a company’s policy on\nabsenteeism might be attacked from the direction\nof disparate impact, a permissible theory of\nliability under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act,\ne.g., Troupe v. May Dept. Stores Co., supra, 20\nF.3d at 738; Scherr v. Woodland School Community\nConsolidated Dist. No. 50, 867 F.2d 974, 979 (7th\nCir. 1988); Lang v. Star Herald, 107 F.3d 1308,\n1314 (8th Cir. 1997); Garcia v. Woman’s Hospital\nof Texas, 97 F.3d 810, 813 (5th Cir. 1996), if it\ncould be shown that the policy weighed more\nheavily on pregnant employees than on nonpregnant\nones and that it was not justified by compelling\nconsiderations of business need. But such an\nargument would not succeed. The concept of\ndisparate impact was developed and is intended\nfor cases in which employers impose eligibility\nrequirements that are not really necessary for\nthe job for which the applicant is being hired,\n\fsuch as requiring that applicants for a job as a\ndishwasher have a high school education. The\nstatute makes this clear, see 42 U.S.C. sec.\n2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i) (\"an unlawful employment\npractice based on disparate impact is established\nunder this subchapter only if a complaining party\ndemonstrates that a respondent uses a particular\nemployment practice that causes a disparate\nimpact on the basis of race, color, religion,\nsex, or national origin and the respondent fails\nto demonstrate that the challenged practice is\njob related for the position in question and\nconsistent with business necessity\"), as do the\ncases interpreting it. See, e.g., Finnegan v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 967 F.2d 1161, 1164\n(7th Cir. 1992) (\"the concept of disparate impact\nwas developed for the purpose of identifying\nsituations where, through inertia or\ninsensitivity, companies were following policies\nthat gratuitously--needlessly--although not\nnecessarily deliberately, excluded black or\nfemale workers from equal employment\nopportunities\"); Lanning v. Southeastern\nPennsylvania Transportation Authority, 181 F.3d\n478, 489 (3d Cir. 1999) (\"a discriminatory cutoff\nscore is impermissible unless shown to measure\nthe minimum qualifications necessary for\nsuccessful performance of the job in question\").\nThe argument here is not that the employer has\nadopted rules or practices that arbitrarily\nexclude pregnant women, but that the employer\nshould be required to excuse pregnant employees\nfrom having to satisfy the legitimate\nrequirements of their job. It is an argument for\nsubsidizing a class of workers, and the concept\nof disparate impact does not stretch that far.\nTroupe v. May Department Stores Co., supra, 20\nF.3d at 738; Urbano v. Continental Airlines,\nInc., 138 F.3d 204, 207-08 (5th Cir. 1998);\nArmstrong v. Flowers Hospital, Inc., 33 F.3d\n1308, 1317 (11th Cir. 1994). Nor would pregnant\nwomen, or women in general, benefit from such a\nstretch. Firms would be deterred from employing\nwomen of childbearing age if required to overlook\nthe inability of a particular woman, because of\ncomplications of pregnancy, to do the work for\nwhich she had been hired.\n\n We turn to the plaintiff’s appeal from the award\nof attorneys’ fees, which she contends was too\nmeager. Her appeal brief (there is no reply\nbrief) is a remarkable document. It is only five\npages long, of which the argument section\noccupies not quite two pages entirely given over\nto truisms and conclusions. The perfunctory\ncharacter of the appeal, which alone would\njustify an affirmance, Kelly v. EPA, 203 F.3d\n519, 522 (7th Cir. 2000); Jones Motor Co. v.\nHoltkamp, Liese, Beckemeier & Childress, P.C.,\n197 F.3d 1190, 1192 (7th Cir. 1999); JTC\n\fPetroleum Co. v. Piasa Motor Fuels, Inc., 190\nF.3d 775, 780-81 (7th Cir. 1999), is remarkable\nrather than merely lamentable because of the\nserious accusations made by the district judge\nagainst the plaintiff’s attorney, Ernest T.\nRossiello, in support of the judge’s decision to\ncut down the fees and costs sought by some 80\npercent. Citing several previous judicial\nopinions criticizing (in one case actually\nsanctioning) Mr. Rossiello for his fee requests\nor affirming stiff cuts in the requested fees,\nShea v. Galaxy Lumber & Const. Co., Ltd., No. 94\nC 906, 1999 WL 138791, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 2,\n1999) (\"this case is not the first time a federal\ndistrict court has suspected a possible\nmanipulation or abuse of billing practices with\nregard to Shea’s counsel [Rossiello] in a FLSA\ncase\"); Herrejon v. Appetizers And, Inc., No. 97\nC 5149, 1999 WL 116598, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 22,\n1999); Campbell v. HSA Managed Care Systems,\nInc., No. 97 C 1622, 1998 WL 417505 (N.D. Ill.\nJuly 21, 1998); Uphoff v. Elegant Bath, Ltd., 176\nF.3d 399, 406-11 (7th Cir. 1999); Spegon v.\nCatholic Bishop of Chicago, 175 F.3d 544 (7th\nCir. 1999), but missing still others (again\nincluding one case in which he was actually\nsanctioned), e.g., Connolly v. National School\nBus Service, Inc., 177 F.3d 593, 598 (7th Cir.\n1999); Scott v. Sunrise Healthcare Corp., No. 95\nC 1277, 1999 WL 787624, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Sep. 23,\n1999) (\"The fee petition in this case, seeking\n$100,000 in fees and costs for a $600 recovery\nis, to put in mildly, unreasonable and\nirresponsible. The amount requested is absurd. No\neffort has been made by plaintiff’s counsel to\nsegregate the fees attributable to the successful\nFLSA claim\"), the judge accused Rossiello, just\nas the judge in Scott had done, of engaging in\nthe dishonest practice of joining to small valid\nclaims, here the plaintiff’s FLSA claim, large\ninvalid and even frivolous claims, and seeking a\nlarge award of attorneys’ fees for services\nostensibly devoted to the small claim but\nactually devoted to the large.\n\n In his application for fees, Rossiello allocated\n124 hours, constituting half the total time that\nhe and his associates put in on the plaintiff’s\nentire case, to the FLSA claim, even though it\nwas a tiny claim which required little more than\nthe record of the days and hours worked by the\nplaintiff and which the defendant did not resist.\nThe defendants had made an offer of judgment for\nthe full amount sought before trial, which the\nplaintiff accepted. And before the offer was made\nthe parties had engaged in only the most limited\ndiscovery on the claim, consisting of one request\nfor documents, a single interrogatory, and ten or\nso minutes of deposition time. The judge was\nrightly aghast at the allocation of half the\n\ftotal lawyer time to the FLSA claim. A similar\nproblem attended Rossiello’s allocation of costs.\n\n In his appeal brief, Rossiello (who signed the\nbrief) does not deny the judge’s accusations.\nAlthough he complains without elaboration that\nthe judge should have allowed him a higher hourly\nfee, he says nothing about the judge’s accusing\nhim of submitting what amounts to a fraudulent\nclaim of attorneys’ fees and of doing this,\nmoreover, in case after case. In these\ncircumstances of confession by silence to serious\ncharges of professional misconduct, we not only\naffirm the district court’s order denying\nRossiello the fees and costs sought; we also\norder him to show cause within 14 days of the\ndate of this order why he should not be\nsanctioned for filing a frivolous appeal from the\ndistrict court’s fee order.

Insurance Consultants of Knox, Inc.,\n187 F.3d 755, 761-62 (7th Cir. 1999). In addition\nwe are referring the question of his improper and\npossibly fraudulent billing practices to the\nexecutive committee of the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois to\nconsider whether to institute disciplinary\nproceedings against him.\n\nAffirmed.\n\f",

The statutory text\nis perfectly clear and covers the issue. The\nright of family leave is conferred only on\nemployees who have worked at least 1,250 hours in\nthe previous 12 months. Yet under the regulation\n\fa worker who had worked 8 hours before seeking\nfamily leave would be entitled to family leave if\nthe employer neglected to inform the employee\npromptly that he or she was ineligible. And this\nregardless of whether the employee had incurred\nany detriment as a result of the employer’s\nsilence.\n\n The last point is critical. If detrimental\nreliance were required, the regulation could be\nunderstood as creating a right of estoppel\n(specifically a right to estop, that is, forbid,\nthe employer to raise a defense of ineligibility\nfor the statutory benefits), and such a right\nmight be thought both consistent with the statute\nand a reasonable method of implementing it, and\nso within the Department’s rulemaking powers.\nLike other equitable doctrines, the doctrine of\nestoppel is invoked in a variety of statutory\ncontexts without reference to particular\nstatutory language. True, if the statute creates\nor excludes a right to plead estoppel, the\ncreative power of the administering court or\nagency is suspended. But there is nothing in the\nFamily Leave and Medical Act that relates to\nmisleading eligibility notices or absences of\nnotice; so far as notice is concerned, the\nstatute merely requires the employer to post a\ngeneral summary of the Act in the workplace. 26\nU.S.C. sec. 2619. We do not read this provision\nto exclude the application of the doctrine of an\nestoppel in an appropriate case. And so an\nemployer who by his silence misled an employee\nconcerning the employee’s entitlement to family\nleave might, if the employee reasonably relied\nand was harmed as a result, be estopped to plead\nthe defense of ineligibility to the employee’s\nclaim of entitlement to family leave.

The challenged\nregulation is not only unauthorized; it is\nunreasonable.\n\nWe move on to the plaintiff’s claim under the\n\fPregnancy Discrimination Act. The Act forbids\ndiscrimination against an employee on account of\nher being pregnant, and of such discrimination\nthe only evidence in this case, evidence that\nfalls short of making out a case that can\nwithstand summary judgment for the employer, is\nsome ugly comments about the plaintiff’s\npregnancy made by an employee who was not in the\nchain of command of the plaintiff and did not (so\nfar as appears) influence in any way the decision\nto fire her. \"The fact that someone who is not\ninvolved in the employment decision of which the\nplaintiff complains expressed discriminatory\nfeelings is not evidence that the decision had a\ndiscriminatory motivation.\" Hunt v.

But such an\nargument would not succeed. The concept of\ndisparate impact was developed and is intended\nfor cases in which employers impose eligibility\nrequirements that are not really necessary for\nthe job for which the applicant is being hired,\n\fsuch as requiring that applicants for a job as a\ndishwasher have a high school education. The\nstatute makes this clear, see 42 U.S.C. sec.\n2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i) (\"an unlawful employment\npractice based on disparate impact is established\nunder this subchapter only if a complaining party\ndemonstrates that a respondent uses a particular\nemployment practice that causes a disparate\nimpact on the basis of race, color, religion,\nsex, or national origin and the respondent fails\nto demonstrate that the challenged practice is\njob related for the position in question and\nconsistent with business necessity\"), as do the\ncases interpreting it.
