(No. 95-6517-CV-KLR),\nKenneth L. Ryskamp, Judge.\n\nBefore COX and BARKETT, Circuit Judges, and FAY, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n        PER CURIAM:\n\n        In two separate appeals, L. Shaq and Mary Doe—both minors represented by their guardians—and\n\nan unincorporated association calling itself Citizens Concerned About Our Children (CCC) challenge the\n\ndistrict court's judgment against them on their claims against the Broward County, Florida School Board for\n\ndiscrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Addressing the two appeals together, we conclude\n\nthat we lack jurisdiction over CCC's interlocutory appeal, that Shaq and Doe's interlocutory appeal (which\n\nis joined with CCC's) is meritless, and that the district court's final summary judgment, the subject of the\n\nsecond appeal, was only partially correct.\n\n                                              I. Background\n\n        In a series of actions beginning thirty years ago, black plaintiffs have accused the Broward County\n\nSchools of impermissibly race-conscious policies. One of those actions, begun in 1983, ended in 1987 with\n\na consent decree. Among other things, that decree required review of all student-assignment policies by a\n\fbiracial committee and restriction of magnet programs to majority-black schools. School Board policy\n\nadopted under the decree requires consideration of the \"racial/ethnic backgrounds of the student population\n\nat each school in order to maintain a unitary school system.\" (R.6-272 at 16.) The practical application of\n\nthis policy was busing students (as it turned out far more black than white) to schools outside their\n\nneighborhoods. Plaintiff Doe rode one of these buses for five years, through fifth grade.\n\n        The School Board also adopted a magnet school policy under the consent decree. The magnet\n\nprograms, as the name implies, were special curricula designed to attract white students to mostly black\n\nschools. In the name of integration of majority-black schools, some magnet programs preferred white pupils\n\nover black pupils up to certain quotas. Shaq, a black pupil, was denied entry to a magnet program in a\n\nmajority-black school for a month at the beginning of a school year, allegedly because of such a quota.\n\n        Shaq and Doe sued the School Board, claiming that Doe's busing and Shaq's exclusion from the\n\nmagnet program violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. In addition to these particularized\n\nclaims by these individual plaintiffs, the complaint included claims of discrimination throughout the Broward\n\nCounty system in funding, facilities, and resources. In asserting these claims, the two individual plaintiffs\n\nwere joined by CCC, which the complaint describes as \"an unincorporated organization comprised of leaders\n\nin the African-American community who have joined together for the common purpose of ending racially\n\ninspired policies of the BROWARD COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD.\" (R.1-23 at 2.)\n\n        The district court dismissed CCC's claims for want of standing, and it dismissed the claims of Shaq\n\nand Doe for equitable relief on the ground that, their claims mooted, they too lacked standing. CCC, Shaq,\n\nand Doe filed an interlocutory appeal. The district court later granted the School Board summary judgment\n\non Shaq and Doe's remaining claims for damages on the ground that the School Board had a compelling\n\ninterest to justify its race-conscious policies—obeying the consent decree. The court also concluded that\n\nShaq and Doe lacked standing to assert claims of system-wide discrimination, and that Shaq and Doe had\n\n\n\n\n                                                     2\n\fproffered insufficient evidence that their schools had poor facilities due to race. The court thus entered final\n\njudgment, and Shaq and Doe appealed.\n\n             The primary issue raised in the interlocutory appeal is whether CCC has standing to pursue any of\n\nthe stated claims. In the appeal from final judgment, the principal argument is that the district court erred in\n\nconcluding that the evidence of discriminatory intent was insufficient.1 Because the district court ruled on\n\nmotions for summary judgment, our review is de novo, see NAACP v. Hunt, 891 F.2d 1555, 1559 (11th\n\nCir.1990), and we apply the same familiar summary-judgment standards.\n\n                                                   II. Discussion\n\nA.           Jurisdiction over CCC's Interlocutory Appeal2\n\n             This court raised the question whether appellate jurisdiction exists over CCC's interlocutory appeal.\n\nHaving reviewed the parties' briefs, we conclude that there is no jurisdiction.3\n\n             As Rule 54 implies, a judgment that eliminates fewer than all the claims or parties is not a final,\n\nappealable judgment; thus, an order dismissing one plaintiff, but not others, is not immediately appealable\n\nby the dismissed plaintiff. See Robinson v. Parke-Davis & Co., 685 F.2d 912, 913 (4th Cir.1982).4 Absent\n\n\n         1\n     Shaq and Doe also argue that Judge Ryskamp should have recused himself for unfair bias. This\nargument is meritless, and we reject it without further discussion. See 11th Cir. R. 36-1.\n\n     2\n     Shaq and Doe joined in this interlocutory appeal to argue that the court improperly granted summary\njudgment against them on their claims for injunctive relief because, having been admitted to the school and\nprograms of their choice, they have lost standing. We have jurisdiction over this appeal, see 28 U.S.C. §\n1292(a)(1), and see no merit to it. Showing standing is the plaintiffs' burden, and we agree after reviewing\nthe record that there is no evidence here that Shaq and Doe face any \"real and immediate\" danger of being\nassigned, because of their race, to a school they do not wish to attend. City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S.\n95, 102, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1665, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). The district court thus did not err in entering\nsummary judgment on this aspect of their claims. Cf. id. at 106-09, 103 S.Ct. at 1667-69.\n         3\n      Our jurisdiction over Shaq and Doe's interlocutory appeal does not confer jurisdiction over CCC's\nappeal: Pendant party appellate jurisdiction does not exist. See Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U.S.\n35, 51, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 1212, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995).\n\n     4\n     Judge Barkett cites Transamerica Finance Corp. v. Banton, Inc., 970 F.2d 810, 814-15 (11th Cir.1992),\nfor the proposition that parties dismissed from an action may always appeal even if the action continues with\nthe other parties in the district court. We decline to read Transamerica, which concerned defendants against\n\n                                                          3\n\fsome exception to the final judgment rule, therefore, CCC could not appeal interlocutorily. CCC invokes two\n\nexceptions. First, it argues that the order had the effect of denying it the injunctive relief it requested in its\n\ncomplaint, thus authorizing interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). Cf. General Elec. Co. v.\n\nMarvel Rare Metals Co., 287 U.S. 430, 431-33, 53 S.Ct. 202, 203-04, 77 L.Ed. 408 (1932). Second, it\n\ncontends that standing is a Cohen issue, and a district court order ruling on it is therefore immediately\n\nappealable. See Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93\n\nL.Ed. 1528 (1949). We reject both of these contentions.\n\n         On the first point, we acknowledge that an order that does not rule on a request for injunctive relief,\n\nbut that has the effect of denying it, may be immediately appealable. See Stringfellow v. Concerned\n\nNeighbors in Action, 480 U.S. 370, 379, 107 S.Ct. 1177, 1183, 94 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987). For such an\n\ninterlocutory order to be appealable before final judgment, the prospective appellant must show that the denial\n\nof injunctive relief has a \"serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence, and that the order can be effectually\n\nchallenged only by immediate appeal.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Carson v. American\n\nBrands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981)) (in turn quoting Baltimore\n\nContractors, Inc. v. Bodinger, 348 U.S. 176, 181, 75 S.Ct. 249, 252, 99 L.Ed. 233 (1955)).\n\n         CCC cannot carry that burden. While the complaint does request injunctive relief, and in its catchall\n\nconclusion, \"additional preliminary and permanent relief as may appear to the Court to be just and proper,\"\n\n(R.1-23 at 9 ¶ 33(f)), in the nearly two years between the filing of the complaint and the district court's\n\ndismissal of CCC's claims for want of standing, CCC did not move for preliminary injunctive relief.\n\n\nwhom default judgments had been entered and Rule 11 sanctions imposed, to have so broad an effect. First,\nthe opinion itself focuses heavily on the fact that sanction accompanied the default judgment, and that\nsanctions—being independent from the merits—often fall into the Cohen exception to the final judgment rule.\nSee id. at 814-15. Second, the court emphasized that in \"the unique circumstances of this case,\" the two\ndefendants (there were eight defendants remaining) could not obtain appellate review of the sanctions. See\nid. at 815. Finally, interpreting Transamerica to authorize all interlocutory appeals by a party who has been\ndismissed from an action would be difficult to harmonize with Rule 54(b). See Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (\"In the\nabsence of such a determination and direction [that is, 54(b) partial final judgment], any order or other form\nof decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of\nfewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties....\").\n\n                                                        4\n\fAdmittedly, whether the request is for preliminary or permanent relief is not necessarily dispositive, see\n\nSwitzerland Cheese Ass'n, Inc. v. E. Horne's Market, Inc., 385 U.S. 23, 25, 87 S.Ct. 193, 195, 17 L.Ed.2d 23\n\n(1966), but a failure to seek immediate relief militates against a conclusion that delaying appeal to final\n\njudgment inflicts irreparable harm. See Carson, 450 U.S. at 84-85, 101 S.Ct. at 997; Shanks v. City of\n\nDallas, Tex., 752 F.2d 1092, 1096 (5th Cir.1985). CCC has advanced no other reason why requiring it to wait\n\nto final judgment for review of the order ruling on standing would have any \"serious consequence.\" We thus\n\nconclude that § 1292(a)(1) does not confer jurisdiction.\n\n         Nor is the order immediately appealable under the Cohen doctrine, the other basis CCC advances.\n\nThis court has explicitly rejected the argument that a defendant may immediately appeal, under the Cohen\n\ndoctrine, a denial of dismissal for want of standing. See Summit Med. Assocs., P.C. v. Pryor, 180 F.3d 1326\n\n(11th Cir.1999). While this case presents the mirror image of the issue addressed in Pryor—here, it is the\n\ngrant of a dismissal for want of standing—the appellants do not explain why a dismissal for want of standing\n\nis any less reviewable on appeal from final judgment than denial of such a dismissal. Like the order in Pryor,\n\ntherefore, this order fails the third prong of the Cohen test. See Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463,\n\n468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2458, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978) (listing elements). We therefore conclude that we lack\n\njurisdiction over CCC's interlocutory appeal.\n\nB.      Appeal from Final Judgment: Summary Judgment on Race Discrimination Claims\n\n1.      Standing to Complain of Facilities in Other Schools.\n\n         The plaintiffs object to the district court's conclusion that they lacked standing to complain about\n\ninferior facilities and funding at majority-black schools that they did not attend. We conclude that the district\n\ncourt did not err. While it is plain that the plaintiffs have standing to complain of allegedly race-based\n\ndifferences in physical plant and programs that they have personally experienced, they cite no law permitting\n\nthem to complain of race-based disadvantages experienced only by other people. In the voting rights context,\n\nthe Supreme Court has held to the contrary that those not actually disadvantaged by a racial classification lack\n\n\n\n                                                       5\n\fstanding to object to it. See United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737, 743-44, 115 S.Ct. 2431, 2435, 132 L.Ed.2d\n\n635 (1995) (\"[E]ven if a governmental actor is discriminating on the basis of race, the resulting injury accords\n\na basis for standing only to those persons who are personally denied equal treatment by the challenged\n\ndiscriminatory conduct.\") (internal quotations omitted). The district court thus properly dismissed the\n\nplaintiffs' claims relating to schools they did not attend.\n\n2.       Merits of Other Claims.\n\na.       Overview.\n\n         Because of the vagueness of the complaint and the plaintiffs' inadequate briefing of the summary\n\njudgment motion and the appeal, the hardest issues in this case have been identifying the claims and what\n\nevidence the plaintiffs believe creates a genuine issue of material fact on their discrimination claims. The\n\ndistrict court saw six claims:         (1) Shaq's claim that she was denied entrance to the T.V.\n\nProduction/Communication and Broadcasting Program at Hallandale High School for one month in 1994,\n\nbecause of her race; (2) Doe's claim that she was bused5 because of her race to Edgewood Elementary School\n\nduring the school year 1995-96; (3) Shaq's claim that Hallandale High School has facilities inferior to other\n\nBroward schools because Hallandale is majority black; (4) Shaq's claim that Hallandale receives lower\n\nfunding than other schools because it is majority black; (5) Doe's claim that she was briefly put in a\n\ndropout-prevention program because of her race; and (6) Doe's claim that she was denied sufficient textbooks\n\nbecause of her race. An attack on this characterization of the claims does not figure among the plaintiffs'\n\narguments, and we therefore accept it.\n\n         These claims fall into groups that are treated a little differently in equal protection law. The first two\n\nclaims challenge government policies that are explicitly racial: the magnet school racial preference policy\n\n\n\n\n     5\n    The parties use the term \"starbursting\" to describe the practice of transporting students to schools away\nfrom their neighborhoods in order to achieve desired racial ratios. We use the ordinary term \"busing,\" which\nis what the School Board has always called the practice, according to the deposition of its member Robert\nParks.\n\n                                                        6\n\fand the County's forced integration policy. Because the challenged state action is explicitly racial, the policy\n\nis subject to strict scrutiny. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 227, 115 S.Ct. 2097,\n\n2113, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995). What that means is that the policy is unconstitutional unless the governmental\n\nentity can prove that it has narrowly tailored the policy to serve a compelling interest. See id.\n\n         The other claims are of disparate treatment; that is, the plaintiffs claim that a governmental entity\n\nis treating them differently because of their race, even though the government has not advertised its motives\n\nin an explicit policy. To force the governmental entity to prove a compelling interest on this kind of claim,\n\nthe plaintiffs must show not only racially disparate treatment but also discriminatory purpose. See\n\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 238-48, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2046-50, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976). We conclude\n\nthat the plaintiffs have not presented enough evidence of racially discriminatory intent to survive summary\n\njudgment.\n\nb.      Facially racial policies.\n\n                                                  i. Busing.\n\n         Doe blames her race-targeted busing on the School Board's Policy 5000. That policy, which was\n\napproved in 1988 and covered student assignment, stated as one of its objectives the \"[m]aintenance of a\n\nunitary system\"—that is, avoiding resegregation. (Expandable Folder # 6, doc. 206, tab 14, at 307.) In\n\nestablishing school boundaries and attendance areas, the policy directed that \"[c]onsideration should be given\n\nto the racial/ethnic backgrounds of the student population at each school in order to maintain a unitary school\n\nsystem.\" (Id. at 308.) During the 1995-96 school year, the only year relevant to the remaining claims, the\n\nsuperintendent proposed implementing this policy by busing students such that the percentage of black pupils\n\nat each school was within 25 percentage points of the countywide percentage. Doe was in fact bused to\n\nEdgewood Elementary School that year (apparently her fifth-grade year) along with several children in her\n\n\n\n\n                                                       7\n\fneighborhood.6 While this evidence does not give us any information about the contours of the busing plan\n\nactually adopted, which apparently is not in the record, it would permit a jury to conclude that a racial policy\n\nexisted. For summary judgment purposes, we conclude that the School Board must show that the policy was\n\nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.\n\n        The School Board justifies this policy by pointing to the 1987 consent decree. The decree stated as\n\nthe purpose of its provisions the \"maintenance of a unitary system of education.\" (Expandable Folder 6, doc.\n\n206, tab 24, at 2.) While the methods are not described in detail, the decree did obviously contemplate forced\n\nintegration, in obscure grammar:\n\n        6. THE SCHOOL BOARD OF BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA shall implement the following:\n\n                 A. That there will be an equal application of methods to ensure that integration will be\n                 shared by both black and white students within Broward County, and that the utilization of\n                 Magnet Programs, other voluntary programs, and feasible and practical boundary changes\n                 will be implemented to achieve such equal application. However, a Bi-Racial Committee,\n                 hereinafter provided for, shall review all boundaries on an annual basis for a report to the\n                 Board.\n\n(Id.) The text of the consent decree is all we have to explain the obligations it imposed. How the School\n\nBoard construed the consent decree, for instance, to arrive at the policy that resulted in Doe's busing to\n\nEdgewood Elementary in 1995-96 is a mystery on the present record.                   At best we have some\n\nrecommendations of the superintendent's desegregation task force. They mention goals for racial distribution\n\nin the schools, but they do not get into any detail about student assignments designed to achieve those goals.\n\n         The School Board's argument and this state of the record present two questions. The first is whether\n\ncompliance with a consent decree ever qualifies as a compelling interest for Fourteenth Amendment purposes.\n\nThis is a question of law, capable of resolution on motion for summary judgment. See Concrete Works of\n\nColorado, Inc. v. Denver, 36 F.3d 1513, 1522 (10th Cir.1994). The second question, however, is whether\n\n\n\n\n   6\n     Although this suit as it stands now is only one for damages, Doe testified in her deposition that the only\ninjury she suffered from attending Edgewood Elementary was being hit in the chest by a softball. Doe did\nnot explain the causal connection between the busing and the softball injury.\n\n                                                       8\n\fthis consent decree imposed this racial policy; for the reasons that follow, we believe this to be a question\n\nof fact unresolved by the current record.\n\n         The legal question here—whether compliance with a consent decree of this sort is a compelling\n\ninterest—answers itself yes, for two reasons. First, consent decrees are a kind of court order. Parties must\n\nobey them, therefore, like court orders, and violation is punishable by contempt. See, e.g., Spallone v. United\n\nStates, 493 U.S. 265, 276, 110 S.Ct. 625, 632, 107 L.Ed.2d 644 (1990). A potential for contempt alone could\n\nprovide the School Board a compelling interest to observe racial policies. But there is more to the point than\n\nthat. Any rule that punished the School Board for failing to disobey the court would not comport with the\n\nsanctity of an unchallenged court order. See, e.g., W.R. Grace & Co. v. Local Union 759, Int'l Union of the\n\nUnited Rubber, Cork, Linoleum & Plastic Workers, 461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 2183, 76 L.Ed.2d 298\n\n(1983) (\"It is beyond question that obedience to judicial orders is an important public policy.\"); Pasadena\n\nCity Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 439, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 2706, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976). This sanctity\n\nexpresses itself in many forms, most strikingly in the collateral order doctrine, which requires a party subject\n\nto a court order to comply with it, pending further review, even if the order arguably violates important\n\nconstitutional rights. See Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307, 315, 87 S.Ct. 1824, 1827, 18 L.Ed.2d\n\n1210 (1967). In other contexts, the law considers an enjoined party to have lost the discretion to contravene\n\na court order. See GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Consumers Union of the United States, Inc., 445 U.S. 375, 386, 100\n\nS.Ct. 1194, 1201, 63 L.Ed.2d 467 (1980). And court orders do not bend simply because the enjoined party,\n\nby virtue of the order, becomes liable to a third party for damages. See W.R. Grace & Co., 461 U.S. at 769,\n\n103 S.Ct. at 2185. Avoiding contempt and respecting the court that entered the consent decree suffice to\n\nmake obedience a compelling interest.7\n\n\n\n\n   7\n     The plaintiffs contend that, even if compliance with the decree were a compelling interest in some cases,\nit should not justify discrimination against them because they were not parties to the litigation that generated\nthe decree. We can't see the logic here; whether or not these plaintiffs are bound by the decree, the School\nBoard obviously is, and the question is whether the School Board has a compelling interest.\n\n                                                       9\n\f        But there is a second reason in this case to deem compliance to be a compelling interest. This consent\n\ndecree rests on a foundation—redressing of past discriminatory wrongs—that the Supreme Court has\n\nexplicitly recognized as a compelling interest by itself when two elements are present.8 See Shaw v. Hunt,\n\n517 U.S. 899, 116 S.Ct. 1894, 1902, 135 L.Ed.2d 207 (1996). The first element is that the past discrimination\n\nbe \"identified.\" Id. The other element is that the government entity have a \"strong basis in evidence\" to\n\nconclude that remedial action was necessary. Id. (quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 277,\n\n106 S.Ct. 1842, 1848, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986) (plurality opinion)). Here these elements were satisfied at the\n\ntime of the consent decree. The past discrimination is identified; it was the confinement of blacks to certain\n\nschools in the system. See Allen v. Board of Pub. Instruction, 312 F.Supp. 1127, 1131 (S.D.Fla.1970)\n\n(finding as fact that 17 of Broward County schools were all black, while another five were more than 99%\n\nblack). The County also had \"sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that there ha[d] been prior\n\ndiscrimination.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277, 106 S.Ct. at 1848-49 (plurality opinion). There were indeed\n\nfindings of fact from litigation of the early '70s that Broward County schools were segregated. While the\n\ndistrict court believed Broward County to be fully desegregated by 1979, (see Order Granting Partial Summ.\n\nJ. at 4-8, Expandable folder 4, doc. 189, ex. 1), no one has argued here that the 1983 race-discrimination\n\naction was unfounded. Complying with this consent decree in particular thus reflected another compelling\n\ninterest beyond respect for court orders.\n\n        The conclusion that compliance with the consent decree is a compelling interest, however, does not\n\nend the summary judgment analysis. Consent decrees are a species of court order, but they are also a kind\n\nof contract. See Local No. 93, Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 519, 106 S.Ct.\n\n3063, 3073, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986). And as is the case in the law of contracts, when a consent decree is\n\nambiguous, we may resort to extrinsic evidence to determine the parties' intent. See United States v. ITT\n\n\n\n\n    8\n     The School Board has not argued that remedying past discrimination would justify its policies even\nwithout a consent decree, so we do not address that issue.\n\n                                                     10\n\fContinental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 238, 95 S.Ct. 926, 935, 43 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975). The consent decree\n\nhere, which we quoted above, implicitly contemplated integration in the sense of ensuring a black and white\n\nmix in the County's schools. Because of this, it may have implied that the School Board should engage in\n\nthe busing policy of which Doe complains. But we cannot go farther than that on the present record, and that\n\nis not far enough.\n\n         A contravening compelling interest justifies an explicitly racial policy only when the policy is\n\nnarrowly tailored to serve that interest. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 227, 115 S.Ct.\n\n2097, 2113, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995). When the compelling interest is compliance with a court order, that\n\nmeans that the governmental entity must face a likelihood of contempt under the order if it abandons the racial\n\npolicy. The reason is obvious: any policy that exceeds the bare requirements of the order no longer closely\n\nfits the compelling interest because abandoning the policy is consistent with respecting the court, avoiding\n\ncontempt liability, and righting the wrongs underlying the decree. In this case, not knowing whether the\n\nparties intended the consent decree to compel busing like that imposed on Doe makes it unknowable whether\n\nthe court would likely have held the School Board in contempt for refusing to bus Doe. The School Board\n\nhas thus not carried its burden on this summary judgment motion of eliminating a genuine issue of fact as to\n\nwhether it had a compelling interest for Doe's busing during the 1995-96 school year.\n\n                                      ii. Magnet school racial quotas.\n\n        Plaintiff Shaq attributes her temporary exclusion from a magnet program to a racial quota system that\n\nwas in effect in the fall of 1994. That system, which apparently resided in School Board policy 5004, is not\n\nin the record, as the district court pointed out. From deposition testimony and the amended 5004 that was\n\nproposed in 1996, however, a jury could find that whites were given preference for magnet programs located\n\nin majority-black schools, until a certain desired percentage of white pupils was achieved. Shaq has thus\n\npresented enough evidence for present purposes to permit the conclusion that this policy was racial and\n\ntherefore unconstitutional, unless it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.\n\n\n\n                                                      11\n\f        Here again, as in the case of Doe's busing, the School Board argues that the 1987 consent decree\n\nprovides a compelling interest. Again, the School Board's proffered evidence leaves doubt as to how the\n\nconsent decree compelled the racial quotas for magnet programs. There is more of a hint here of the link\n\nbetween the decree and the policy; the decree explicitly mentions magnet programs, albeit in the same\n\nobscure grammar:\n\n        6. THE SCHOOL BOARD OF BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA shall implement the following:\n\n        ...\n\n                 B. That Magnet Programs be primarily restricted to traditionally black schools, and that the\n        Plaintiff be provided with a list of all Magnet Programs, real or imagined, their locations, and the\n        current populations of students participating in said programs.\n\n(Expandable Folder 6, doc. 206, tab 24, at 2.) Magnet programs also appeared in the section of the decree\n\naddressing integration, which was quoted above, as a method of integration. We could infer that some sort\n\nof racial preference would be necessary to achieve the desired desegregation. But what is missing is any\n\nevidence that quotas (whose details, as we said earlier, are unclear from this record)—not to mention the\n\nactual quota figures that were chosen—were necessary to comply with the consent decree. We thus reach\n\nthe same conclusion on this claim as we did on the Doe's busing claim: that the School Board has failed to\n\ncarry its burden on summary judgment to eliminate any genuine issue of fact concerning its defense of a\n\ncompelling interest.\n\nc.      Disparate treatment claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    12\n\f         The remaining claims concern alleged racial distinctions that are not explicit.9 As we explained\n\nabove, \"official action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in racially disproportionate\n\nimpact.... Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal\n\nProtection Clause.\" Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264-65,\n\n97 S.Ct. 555, 563, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). In this summary judgment context, when the defendant has\n\npointed to the absence of evidence of discriminatory intent, it becomes the plaintiffs' job to produce such\n\nevidence. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).\n\nIf the plaintiffs have done so, they have certainly not made it known—their brief to this court takes the district\n\ncourt to task for failing to \"examine circumstantial evidence including the historic background of the decision\n\nmaking body, and legislative or administrative history of the decisions,\" but the plaintiffs have not provided\n\nus with a single record cite to any such history, or to any other evidence of discriminatory intent. In the\n\ninterest of justice, we have nonetheless examined the record for such evidence. The record in fact does not\n\nsupport any assertion of discriminatory intent.\n\n        We can start with the background and historical facts that courts properly look to for evidence of\n\nintent. See Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 623-27, 102 S.Ct. 3272, 3278-81, 73 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1982). The\n\nparties agree that the Broward County schools have been unitary since 1979, and that unitariness came rapidly\n\nwith good-faith compliance with court-ordered desegregation. In 1987, following a lawsuit by some black\n\nparents, the School Board agreed to desegregation measures that, according to the plaintiffs here, were not\n\n\n\n\n   9\n     By cunningly culling a quotation from a School Board rule, Doe tries to represent her claim concerning\ntracking in a dropout prevention program as one arising from a facially racial policy. The policy indeed limits\nhow long pupils of a certain race may be kept apart from pupils of another race, as Doe points out. But\nimmediately above this provision, in all capital letters, the policy (number 5150) behind the rule provides that\n\"STUDENTS SHALL NOT BE ASSIGNED TO ABILITY GROUPS, TRACKS, SPECIAL EDUCATION\nCLASSES, CLASSES FOR THE MENTALLY RETAINED, OR OTHER CURRICULAR OR\nEXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES ON THE BASIS OF RACE....\" (Expandable folder 6, doc. 206, tab\n8.) This policy is thus not only not explicitly racial, it is explicitly non racial. Like the other claims discussed\nin this section, therefore, this claim survives summary judgment only if the plaintiffs have produced sufficient\nevidence that this nonracial policy rests on a discriminatory purpose.\n\n                                                        13\n\fconstitutionally necessary. When other black parents complained about the desegregation measures—such\n\nas the busing at issue here—the Board established a desegregation task force to make recommendations. The\n\ntask force recommended eliminating the busing, which the Board did. Furthermore, when parents complained\n\nthat suspension rates were higher for black pupils than white, the Board directed that school improvement\n\nteams examine suspension practices. Finally, the Board's mission statement is to provide the County's\n\n\"multi-cultural, diverse population\" with \"equal educational opportunity.\" (Expandable folder 1, doc. 91, at\n\n31.) This evidence does not support an inference of discriminatory intent. (Indeed, if anything this evidence\n\ndepicts a well-meaning Board tiptoeing through a racial minefield.)\n\n         The plaintiffs' other evidence is no better. The plaintiffs claim that for racial reasons western\n\nBroward schools get more money than eastern Broward schools, and thus have better facilities. But in none\n\nof the plaintiffs' depositions of School Board members or school staff did the plaintiffs pursue the questions\n\nof how the Board distributes money among schools in the County, how funding requests are made, how the\n\nBoard weighs requests, or how needs and priorities may differ from school to school. In short, they did not\n\nelucidate the process in a level of detail that might expose discriminatory intent.10 Instead, the plaintiffs point\n\nonly to the disparities between schools that are the basis of their claims. This is just not enough evidence of\n\nintent when there are so many imaginable reasons for differences, both global—eastern Broward County\n\nneighborhoods are older, and the schools there are older as well—and specific to each spending decision, such\n\nas when the Board decides for legitimate reasons that School X needs a new roof more than School Y needs\n\na new gym floor. And as for Doe's claim of racial tracking, the plaintiffs apparently did not depose or seek\n\n\n\n\n    10\n      What scanty testimony there is about certain spending items, such as new school construction, is that\npupil health and safety, among other concerns peculiar to certain schools, motivated decisions. (See Robert\nParks Dep. at 51-54.)\n\n                                                        14\n\faffidavits from the officials who tracked Doe into an anti-dropout program. Thus, apart from Doe's say-so11\n\nwe have no idea whether her placement there was for racial or other reasons.\n\n          Because there is not enough evidence in the record for a jury to find that the School Board's funding\n\nand resource decisions carry a racial taint, or that the School Board or superintendent tracked Doe for racial\n\nreasons, the district court properly granted summary judgment on those claims.\n\n                                                III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the interlocutory appeal of CCC and affirm the district court's\n\nsummary judgment against Shaq and Doe on their claims for injunctive relief. We reverse, however, the\n\nsummary judgment entered on Doe's claim for damages for being bused during the 1995-96 school year and\n\nShaq's claim for damages for being denied entry into a magnet program for one month, and we remand for\n\nfurther proceedings on these two damages claims. The district court's judgment is in all other respects\n\naffirmed.\n\n          NO. 97-5078 AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED FOR WANT OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nIN PART.\n\n          NO. 98-4199 AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\n\n          BARKETT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n          I concur in the court's resolution of Shaq and Doe's appeal. I respectfully dissent, however, from the\n\nmajority's conclusion that the order from which an interlocutory appeal is sought by Citizens Concerned\n\nAbout Our Children (\"CCC\") is one which cannot be appealed under Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan\n\nCorp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). I believe our precedent requires the opposite\n\nresult. Interlocutory appeals are permitted under the collateral order doctrine if the order appealed from: (1)\n\nconclusively determines the disputed question; (2) resolves an important issue completely separate from the\n\n\n\n\n     11\n      Even on summary judgment, a court is not obliged to take as true testimony that is not based on\npersonal knowledge. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).\n\n                                                       15\n\fmerits of the action; and (3) is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. See Gulfstream\n\nAerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U.S. 271, 276, 108 S.Ct. 1133, 99 L.Ed.2d 296 (1988) (reiterating\n\nthe three-prong test of Cohen ).\n\n        The majority finds that the district court's order fails the third prong of the Cohen test, on the basis\n\nof Summit Med. Assocs., P.C. v. Pryor, 180 F.3d 1326 (11th Cir.1999). I believe Pryor is not applicable and\n\nthat this case is controlled by Transamerica Commercial Finance Corp. v. Banton, 970 F.2d 810 (11th\n\nCir.1992).\n\n        In Pryor, the Court found that a defendant may not immediately appeal a denial of a motion to\n\ndismiss for lack of standing. See Pryor, 180 F.3d at 1334. The majority suggests that a denial of a motion\n\nto dismiss for want of standing is no different from a judgment granting a motion to dismiss for want of\n\nstanding. See Maj. Op. at 309. I find these actions to be significantly different in their consequences. When\n\na district court denies a motion to dismiss, all parties remain in the lawsuit and participate therein. When a\n\ndistrict court grants the motion, the dismissed party can no longer participate and loses any opportunity to\n\nclarify or to affect in any way the ongoing case.\n\n        Moreover, this court's precedent has explicitly recognized that excluding a party from the remainder\n\nof an ongoing case satisfies the third prong of Cohen. In Transamerica Commercial Finance Corp., 970 F.2d\n\nat 814, this Court held that an order dismissing two of the eleven defendants in the case by granting motions\n\nfor summary and default judgments as a form of sanction was immediately appealable under the collateral\n\norder doctrine. The court concluded that such an order, albeit not a final judgment under section 1291, was\n\nappealable as an interlocutory order because otherwise it would be effectively unreviewable.1 As the court\n\n\n   1\n     This does not mean that parties dismissed from an action may always have an interlocutory appeal from\na nonfinal order. The order must still fulfill the first two prongs of Cohen, that is it must conclusively\ndetermine the disputed question and resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the\naction. In Transamerica, the Court concluded that the district court's order undoubtedly fulfilled the first two\nCohen prongs. Similarly, the question whether a party has standing easily fulfills the first two prongs of\nCohen because a standing determination is both separate from the merits of a claim and conclusively resolves\nan important disputed question. See Pryor, 180 F.3d at 1334.\n\n                                                      16\n\fnoted, \"having been severed from the underlying case\" the two defendants could lose their opportunity to\n\nappeal for \"the remaining defendants may settle or may decide not to appeal.\" Id. at 815.\n\n        In the case at hand, CCC may be subjected to irreparable harm in the absence of an immediate appeal.\n\nThe district court, in the same order dismissing CCC for lack of standing also denied Shaq and Doe the right\n\nto proceed with their claims for injunctive relief. Furthermore, the district court's September 5, 1997 order\n\nfound that Shaq and Doe did not have standing to challenge the alleged system-wide racial disparities and\n\ninequities in the Broward County School system. The district court limited Shaq and Doe's claims to those\n\npractices directed towards them only at the schools which they attended. These rulings relating to Shaq and\n\nDoe were incorporated in the subsequent final judgment but CCC was not included therein. Therefore, if the\n\nissue of CCC's standing is not reviewed in this appeal, the parties will have no avenue through which to\n\nchallenge the alleged system-wide unconstitutional practices as CCC tried to do in its complaint.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, I would find that this Court has appellate jurisdiction over CCC's\n\ninterlocutory appeal and should resolve the issues pertaining thereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     17\n\f",

Addressing the two appeals together, we conclude\n\nthat we lack jurisdiction over CCC's interlocutory appeal, that Shaq and Doe's interlocutory appeal (which\n\nis joined with CCC's) is meritless, and that the district court's final summary judgment, the subject of the\n\nsecond appeal, was only partially correct.\n\n                                              I. Background\n\n        In a series of actions beginning thirty years ago, black plaintiffs have accused the Broward County\n\nSchools of impermissibly race-conscious policies. One of those actions, begun in 1983, ended in 1987 with\n\na consent decree. Among other things, that decree required review of all student-assignment policies by a\n\fbiracial committee and restriction of magnet programs to majority-black schools. School Board policy\n\nadopted under the decree requires consideration of the \"racial/ethnic backgrounds of the student population\n\nat each school in order to maintain a unitary school system.\" (R.6-272 at 16.) The practical application of\n\nthis policy was busing students (as it turned out far more black than white) to schools outside their\n\nneighborhoods. Plaintiff Doe rode one of these buses for five years, through fifth grade.\n\n        The School Board also adopted a magnet school policy under the consent decree. The magnet\n\nprograms, as the name implies, were special curricula designed to attract white students to mostly black\n\nschools. In the name of integration of majority-black schools, some magnet programs preferred white pupils\n\nover black pupils up to certain quotas. Shaq, a black pupil, was denied entry to a magnet program in a\n\nmajority-black school for a month at the beginning of a school year, allegedly because of such a quota.\n\n        Shaq and Doe sued the School Board, claiming that Doe's busing and Shaq's exclusion from the\n\nmagnet program violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. In addition to these particularized\n\nclaims by these individual plaintiffs, the complaint included claims of discrimination throughout the Broward\n\nCounty system in funding, facilities, and resources. In asserting these claims, the two individual plaintiffs\n\nwere joined by CCC, which the complaint describes as \"an unincorporated organization comprised of leaders\n\nin the African-American community who have joined together for the common purpose of ending racially\n\ninspired policies of the BROWARD COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD.\" (R.1-23 at 2.)\n\n        The district court dismissed CCC's claims for want of standing, and it dismissed the claims of Shaq\n\nand Doe for equitable relief on the ground that, their claims mooted, they too lacked standing. CCC, Shaq,\n\nand Doe filed an interlocutory appeal. The district court later granted the School Board summary judgment\n\non Shaq and Doe's remaining claims for damages on the ground that the School Board had a compelling\n\ninterest to justify its race-conscious policies—obeying the consent decree. The court also concluded that\n\nShaq and Doe lacked standing to assert claims of system-wide discrimination, and that Shaq and Doe had\n\n\n\n\n                                                     2\n\fproffered insufficient evidence that their schools had poor facilities due to race. The court thus entered final\n\njudgment, and Shaq and Doe appealed.\n\n             The primary issue raised in the interlocutory appeal is whether CCC has standing to pursue any of\n\nthe stated claims. In the appeal from final judgment, the principal argument is that the district court erred in\n\nconcluding that the evidence of discriminatory intent was insufficient.1 Because the district court ruled on\n\nmotions for summary judgment, our review is de novo, see NAACP v.

Standing to Complain of Facilities in Other Schools.\n\n         The plaintiffs object to the district court's conclusion that they lacked standing to complain about\n\ninferior facilities and funding at majority-black schools that they did not attend. We conclude that the district\n\ncourt did not err. While it is plain that the plaintiffs have standing to complain of allegedly race-based\n\ndifferences in physical plant and programs that they have personally experienced, they cite no law permitting\n\nthem to complain of race-based disadvantages experienced only by other people. In the voting rights context,\n\nthe Supreme Court has held to the contrary that those not actually disadvantaged by a racial classification lack\n\n\n\n                                                       5\n\fstanding to object to it.

The district court thus properly dismissed the\n\nplaintiffs' claims relating to schools they did not attend.\n\n2.       Merits of Other Claims.\n\na.       Overview.\n\n         Because of the vagueness of the complaint and the plaintiffs' inadequate briefing of the summary\n\njudgment motion and the appeal, the hardest issues in this case have been identifying the claims and what\n\nevidence the plaintiffs believe creates a genuine issue of material fact on their discrimination claims. The\n\ndistrict court saw six claims:         (1) Shaq's claim that she was denied entrance to the T.V.\n\nProduction/Communication and Broadcasting Program at Hallandale High School for one month in 1994,\n\nbecause of her race; (2) Doe's claim that she was bused5 because of her race to Edgewood Elementary School\n\nduring the school year 1995-96; (3) Shaq's claim that Hallandale High School has facilities inferior to other\n\nBroward schools because Hallandale is majority black; (4) Shaq's claim that Hallandale receives lower\n\nfunding than other schools because it is majority black; (5) Doe's claim that she was briefly put in a\n\ndropout-prevention program because of her race; and (6) Doe's claim that she was denied sufficient textbooks\n\nbecause of her race. An attack on this characterization of the claims does not figure among the plaintiffs'\n\narguments, and we therefore accept it.\n\n         These claims fall into groups that are treated a little differently in equal protection law. The first two\n\nclaims challenge government policies that are explicitly racial: the magnet school racial preference policy\n\n\n\n\n     5\n    The parties use the term \"starbursting\" to describe the practice of transporting students to schools away\nfrom their neighborhoods in order to achieve desired racial ratios. We use the ordinary term \"busing,\" which\nis what the School Board has always called the practice, according to the deposition of its member Robert\nParks.\n\n                                                        6\n\fand the County's forced integration policy. Because the challenged state action is explicitly racial, the policy\n\nis subject to strict scrutiny. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

What that means is that the policy is unconstitutional unless the governmental\n\nentity can prove that it has narrowly tailored the policy to serve a compelling interest. See id.\n\n         The other claims are of disparate treatment; that is, the plaintiffs claim that a governmental entity\n\nis treating them differently because of their race, even though the government has not advertised its motives\n\nin an explicit policy. To force the governmental entity to prove a compelling interest on this kind of claim,\n\nthe plaintiffs must show not only racially disparate treatment but also discriminatory purpose.

We conclude\n\nthat the plaintiffs have not presented enough evidence of racially discriminatory intent to survive summary\n\njudgment.\n\nb.      Facially racial policies.\n\n                                                  i. Busing.\n\n         Doe blames her race-targeted busing on the School Board's Policy 5000. That policy, which was\n\napproved in 1988 and covered student assignment, stated as one of its objectives the \"[m]aintenance of a\n\nunitary system\"—that is, avoiding resegregation. (Expandable Folder # 6, doc. 206, tab 14, at 307.) In\n\nestablishing school boundaries and attendance areas, the policy directed that \"[c]onsideration should be given\n\nto the racial/ethnic backgrounds of the student population at each school in order to maintain a unitary school\n\nsystem.\" (Id. at 308.) During the 1995-96 school year, the only year relevant to the remaining claims, the\n\nsuperintendent proposed implementing this policy by busing students such that the percentage of black pupils\n\nat each school was within 25 percentage points of the countywide percentage. Doe was in fact bused to\n\nEdgewood Elementary School that year (apparently her fifth-grade year) along with several children in her\n\n\n\n\n                                                       7\n\fneighborhood.6 While this evidence does not give us any information about the contours of the busing plan\n\nactually adopted, which apparently is not in the record, it would permit a jury to conclude that a racial policy\n\nexisted. For summary judgment purposes, we conclude that the School Board must show that the policy was\n\nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.\n\n        The School Board justifies this policy by pointing to the 1987 consent decree. The decree stated as\n\nthe purpose of its provisions the \"maintenance of a unitary system of education.\" (Expandable Folder 6, doc.\n\n206, tab 24, at 2.) While the methods are not described in detail, the decree did obviously contemplate forced\n\nintegration, in obscure grammar:\n\n        6. THE SCHOOL BOARD OF BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA shall implement the following:\n\n                 A. That there will be an equal application of methods to ensure that integration will be\n                 shared by both black and white students within Broward County, and that the utilization of\n                 Magnet Programs, other voluntary programs, and feasible and practical boundary changes\n                 will be implemented to achieve such equal application. However, a Bi-Racial Committee,\n                 hereinafter provided for, shall review all boundaries on an annual basis for a report to the\n                 Board.\n\n(Id.) The text of the consent decree is all we have to explain the obligations it imposed. How the School\n\nBoard construed the consent decree, for instance, to arrive at the policy that resulted in Doe's busing to\n\nEdgewood Elementary in 1995-96 is a mystery on the present record.                   At best we have some\n\nrecommendations of the superintendent's desegregation task force. They mention goals for racial distribution\n\nin the schools, but they do not get into any detail about student assignments designed to achieve those goals.\n\n         The School Board's argument and this state of the record present two questions. The first is whether\n\ncompliance with a consent decree ever qualifies as a compelling interest for Fourteenth Amendment purposes.\n\nThis is a question of law, capable of resolution on motion for summary judgment. See Concrete Works of\n\nColorado, Inc. v. Denver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679519\"><a href=\"/opinion/679519/concrete-works-of-colorado-inc-a-colorado-corporation-v-denver-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1522 (10th Cir.1994). The second question, however, is whether\n\n\n\n\n   6\n     Although this suit as it stands now is only one for damages, Doe testified in her deposition that the only\ninjury she suffered from attending Edgewood Elementary was being hit in the chest by a softball. Doe did\nnot explain the causal connection between the busing and the softball injury.\n\n                                                       8\n\fthis consent decree imposed this racial policy; for the reasons that follow, we believe this to be a question\n\nof fact unresolved by the current record.\n\n         The legal question here—whether compliance with a consent decree of this sort is a compelling\n\ninterest—answers itself yes, for two reasons. First, consent decrees are a kind of court order. Parties must\n\nobey them, therefore, like court orders, and violation is punishable by contempt. See, e.g., Spallone v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112349\"><a href=\"/opinion/112349/spallone-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 276, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112349\"><a href=\"/opinion/112349/spallone-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A potential for contempt alone could\n\nprovide the School Board a compelling interest to observe racial policies. But there is more to the point than\n\nthat. Any rule that punished the School Board for failing to disobey the court would not comport with the\n\nsanctity of an unchallenged court order. See, e.g., W.R. Grace & Co. v.

Avoiding contempt and respecting the court that entered the consent decree suffice to\n\nmake obedience a compelling interest.7\n\n\n\n\n   7\n     The plaintiffs contend that, even if compliance with the decree were a compelling interest in some cases,\nit should not justify discrimination against them because they were not parties to the litigation that generated\nthe decree. We can't see the logic here; whether or not these plaintiffs are bound by the decree, the School\nBoard obviously is, and the question is whether the School Board has a compelling interest.\n\n                                                       9\n\f        But there is a second reason in this case to deem compliance to be a compelling interest. This consent\n\ndecree rests on a foundation—redressing of past discriminatory wrongs—that the Supreme Court has\n\nexplicitly recognized as a compelling interest by itself when two elements are present.8 See Shaw v.

The past discrimination is identified; it was the confinement of blacks to certain\n\nschools in the system. See Allen v. Board of Pub. Instruction, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The County also had \"sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that there ha[d] been prior\n\ndiscrimination.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277, 106 S.Ct. at 1848-49 (plurality opinion). There were indeed\n\nfindings of fact from litigation of the early '70s that Broward County schools were segregated. While the\n\ndistrict court believed Broward County to be fully desegregated by 1979, (see Order Granting Partial Summ.\n\nJ. at 4-8, Expandable folder 4, doc. 189, ex. 1), no one has argued here that the 1983 race-discrimination\n\naction was unfounded. Complying with this consent decree in particular thus reflected another compelling\n\ninterest beyond respect for court orders.\n\n        The conclusion that compliance with the consent decree is a compelling interest, however, does not\n\nend the summary judgment analysis. Consent decrees are a species of court order, but they are also a kind\n\nof contract. See Local No. 93, Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters v.

And as is the case in the law of contracts, when a consent decree is\n\nambiguous, we may resort to extrinsic evidence to determine the parties' intent. See United States v.

The consent decree\n\nhere, which we quoted above, implicitly contemplated integration in the sense of ensuring a black and white\n\nmix in the County's schools. Because of this, it may have implied that the School Board should engage in\n\nthe busing policy of which Doe complains. But we cannot go farther than that on the present record, and that\n\nis not far enough.\n\n         A contravening compelling interest justifies an explicitly racial policy only when the policy is\n\nnarrowly tailored to serve that interest. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

When the compelling interest is compliance with a court order, that\n\nmeans that the governmental entity must face a likelihood of contempt under the order if it abandons the racial\n\npolicy. The reason is obvious: any policy that exceeds the bare requirements of the order no longer closely\n\nfits the compelling interest because abandoning the policy is consistent with respecting the court, avoiding\n\ncontempt liability, and righting the wrongs underlying the decree. In this case, not knowing whether the\n\nparties intended the consent decree to compel busing like that imposed on Doe makes it unknowable whether\n\nthe court would likely have held the School Board in contempt for refusing to bus Doe. The School Board\n\nhas thus not carried its burden on this summary judgment motion of eliminating a genuine issue of fact as to\n\nwhether it had a compelling interest for Doe's busing during the 1995-96 school year.\n\n                                      ii. Magnet school racial quotas.\n\n        Plaintiff Shaq attributes her temporary exclusion from a magnet program to a racial quota system that\n\nwas in effect in the fall of 1994. That system, which apparently resided in School Board policy 5004, is not\n\nin the record, as the district court pointed out. From deposition testimony and the amended 5004 that was\n\nproposed in 1996, however, a jury could find that whites were given preference for magnet programs located\n\nin majority-black schools, until a certain desired percentage of white pupils was achieved. Shaq has thus\n\npresented enough evidence for present purposes to permit the conclusion that this policy was racial and\n\ntherefore unconstitutional, unless it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.\n\n\n\n                                                      11\n\f        Here again, as in the case of Doe's busing, the School Board argues that the 1987 consent decree\n\nprovides a compelling interest. Again, the School Board's proffered evidence leaves doubt as to how the\n\nconsent decree compelled the racial quotas for magnet programs. There is more of a hint here of the link\n\nbetween the decree and the policy; the decree explicitly mentions magnet programs, albeit in the same\n\nobscure grammar:\n\n        6. THE SCHOOL BOARD OF BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA shall implement the following:\n\n        ...\n\n                 B. That Magnet Programs be primarily restricted to traditionally black schools, and that the\n        Plaintiff be provided with a list of all Magnet Programs, real or imagined, their locations, and the\n        current populations of students participating in said programs.\n\n(Expandable Folder 6, doc. 206, tab 24, at 2.) Magnet programs also appeared in the section of the decree\n\naddressing integration, which was quoted above, as a method of integration. We could infer that some sort\n\nof racial preference would be necessary to achieve the desired desegregation. But what is missing is any\n\nevidence that quotas (whose details, as we said earlier, are unclear from this record)—not to mention the\n\nactual quota figures that were chosen—were necessary to comply with the consent decree. We thus reach\n\nthe same conclusion on this claim as we did on the Doe's busing claim: that the School Board has failed to\n\ncarry its burden on summary judgment to eliminate any genuine issue of fact concerning its defense of a\n\ncompelling interest.\n\nc.      Disparate treatment claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    12\n\f         The remaining claims concern alleged racial distinctions that are not explicit.9 As we explained\n\nabove, \"official action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in racially disproportionate\n\nimpact....

In the\n\ninterest of justice, we have nonetheless examined the record for such evidence. The record in fact does not\n\nsupport any assertion of discriminatory intent.\n\n        We can start with the background and historical facts that courts properly look to for evidence of\n\nintent.

The\n\nparties agree that the Broward County schools have been unitary since 1979, and that unitariness came rapidly\n\nwith good-faith compliance with court-ordered desegregation. In 1987, following a lawsuit by some black\n\nparents, the School Board agreed to desegregation measures that, according to the plaintiffs here, were not\n\n\n\n\n   9\n     By cunningly culling a quotation from a School Board rule, Doe tries to represent her claim concerning\ntracking in a dropout prevention program as one arising from a facially racial policy. The policy indeed limits\nhow long pupils of a certain race may be kept apart from pupils of another race, as Doe points out. But\nimmediately above this provision, in all capital letters, the policy (number 5150) behind the rule provides that\n\"STUDENTS SHALL NOT BE ASSIGNED TO ABILITY GROUPS, TRACKS, SPECIAL EDUCATION\nCLASSES, CLASSES FOR THE MENTALLY RETAINED, OR OTHER CURRICULAR OR\nEXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES ON THE BASIS OF RACE....\" (Expandable folder 6, doc. 206, tab\n8.) This policy is thus not only not explicitly racial, it is explicitly non racial. Like the other claims discussed\nin this section, therefore, this claim survives summary judgment only if the plaintiffs have produced sufficient\nevidence that this nonracial policy rests on a discriminatory purpose.\n\n                                                        13\n\fconstitutionally necessary. When other black parents complained about the desegregation measures—such\n\nas the busing at issue here—the Board established a desegregation task force to make recommendations. The\n\ntask force recommended eliminating the busing, which the Board did. Furthermore, when parents complained\n\nthat suspension rates were higher for black pupils than white, the Board directed that school improvement\n\nteams examine suspension practices. Finally, the Board's mission statement is to provide the County's\n\n\"multi-cultural, diverse population\" with \"equal educational opportunity.\" (Expandable folder 1, doc. 91, at\n\n31.) This evidence does not support an inference of discriminatory intent. (Indeed, if anything this evidence\n\ndepicts a well-meaning Board tiptoeing through a racial minefield.)\n\n         The plaintiffs' other evidence is no better. The plaintiffs claim that for racial reasons western\n\nBroward schools get more money than eastern Broward schools, and thus have better facilities. But in none\n\nof the plaintiffs' depositions of School Board members or school staff did the plaintiffs pursue the questions\n\nof how the Board distributes money among schools in the County, how funding requests are made, how the\n\nBoard weighs requests, or how needs and priorities may differ from school to school. In short, they did not\n\nelucidate the process in a level of detail that might expose discriminatory intent.10 Instead, the plaintiffs point\n\nonly to the disparities between schools that are the basis of their claims. This is just not enough evidence of\n\nintent when there are so many imaginable reasons for differences, both global—eastern Broward County\n\nneighborhoods are older, and the schools there are older as well—and specific to each spending decision, such\n\nas when the Board decides for legitimate reasons that School X needs a new roof more than School Y needs\n\na new gym floor. And as for Doe's claim of racial tracking, the plaintiffs apparently did not depose or seek\n\n\n\n\n    10\n      What scanty testimony there is about certain spending items, such as new school construction, is that\npupil health and safety, among other concerns peculiar to certain schools, motivated decisions. (See Robert\nParks Dep. at 51-54.)\n\n                                                        14\n\faffidavits from the officials who tracked Doe into an anti-dropout program. Thus, apart from Doe's say-so11\n\nwe have no idea whether her placement there was for racial or other reasons.\n\n          Because there is not enough evidence in the record for a jury to find that the School Board's funding\n\nand resource decisions carry a racial taint, or that the School Board or superintendent tracked Doe for racial\n\nreasons, the district court properly granted summary judgment on those claims.\n\n                                                III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the interlocutory appeal of CCC and affirm the district court's\n\nsummary judgment against Shaq and Doe on their claims for injunctive relief. We reverse, however, the\n\nsummary judgment entered on Doe's claim for damages for being bused during the 1995-96 school year and\n\nShaq's claim for damages for being denied entry into a magnet program for one month, and we remand for\n\nfurther proceedings on these two damages claims. The district court's judgment is in all other respects\n\naffirmed.\n\n          NO. 97-5078 AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED FOR WANT OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nIN PART.\n\n          NO. 98-4199 AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\n\n          BARKETT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n          I concur in the court's resolution of Shaq and Doe's appeal. I respectfully dissent, however, from the\n\nmajority's conclusion that the order from which an interlocutory appeal is sought by Citizens Concerned\n\nAbout Our Children (\"CCC\") is one which cannot be appealed under Cohen v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988) (reiterating\n\nthe three-prong test of Cohen ).\n\n        The majority finds that the district court's order fails the third prong of the Cohen test, on the basis\n\nof Summit Med. Assocs., P.C. v. Pryor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1326</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir.1999). I believe Pryor is not applicable and\n\nthat this case is controlled by Transamerica Commercial Finance Corp. v. Banton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587392\"><a href=\"/opinion/587392/transamerica-commercial-finance-corporation-aka-borg-warner-acceptance/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th\n\nCir.1992).\n\n        In Pryor, the Court found that a defendant may not immediately appeal a denial of a motion to\n\ndismiss for lack of standing. See Pryor, 180 F.3d at 1334. The majority suggests that a denial of a motion\n\nto dismiss for want of standing is no different from a judgment granting a motion to dismiss for want of\n\nstanding. See Maj. Op. at 309. I find these actions to be significantly different in their consequences. When\n\na district court denies a motion to dismiss, all parties remain in the lawsuit and participate therein. When a\n\ndistrict court grants the motion, the dismissed party can no longer participate and loses any opportunity to\n\nclarify or to affect in any way the ongoing case.\n\n        Moreover, this court's precedent has explicitly recognized that excluding a party from the remainder\n\nof an ongoing case satisfies the third prong of Cohen. In Transamerica Commercial Finance Corp., 970 F.2d\n\nat 814, this Court held that an order dismissing two of the eleven defendants in the case by granting motions\n\nfor summary and default judgments as a form of sanction was immediately appealable under the collateral\n\norder doctrine. The court concluded that such an order, albeit not a final judgment under section 1291, was\n\nappealable as an interlocutory order because otherwise it would be effectively unreviewable.1 As the court\n\n\n   1\n     This does not mean that parties dismissed from an action may always have an interlocutory appeal from\na nonfinal order. The order must still fulfill the first two prongs of Cohen, that is it must conclusively\ndetermine the disputed question and resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the\naction. In Transamerica, the Court concluded that the district court's order undoubtedly fulfilled the first two\nCohen prongs. Similarly, the question whether a party has standing easily fulfills the first two prongs of\nCohen because a standing determination is both separate from the merits of a claim and conclusively resolves\nan important disputed question. See Pryor, 180 F.3d at 1334.\n\n                                                      16\n\fnoted, \"having been severed from the underlying case\" the two defendants could lose their opportunity to\n\nappeal for \"the remaining defendants may settle or may decide not to appeal.\" Id. at 815.\n\n        In the case at hand, CCC may be subjected to irreparable harm in the absence of an immediate appeal.\n\nThe district court, in the same order dismissing CCC for lack of standing also denied Shaq and Doe the right\n\nto proceed with their claims for injunctive relief. Furthermore, the district court's September 5, 1997 order\n\nfound that Shaq and Doe did not have standing to challenge the alleged system-wide racial disparities and\n\ninequities in the Broward County School system. The district court limited Shaq and Doe's claims to those\n\npractices directed towards them only at the schools which they attended. These rulings relating to Shaq and\n\nDoe were incorporated in the subsequent final judgment but CCC was not included therein. Therefore, if the\n\nissue of CCC's standing is not reviewed in this appeal, the parties will have no avenue through which to\n\nchallenge the alleged system-wide unconstitutional practices as CCC tried to do in its complaint.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, I would find that this Court has appellate jurisdiction over CCC's\n\ninterlocutory appeal and should resolve the issues pertaining thereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     17\n\f</pre>",
