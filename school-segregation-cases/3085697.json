GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:\n        In this declaratory judgment action, the State of Texas appeals the\ndistrict court’s order dismissing this action under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Texas’s complaint\nseeks a declaration that an Enforcement Guidance document from the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) regarding the hiring of\npersons with criminal backgrounds violates the Administrative Procedure Act\n(“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–06. The EEOC has instigated no legal proceedings\nagainst the State of Texas regarding the subject of felony hiring bans and Title\nVII.\n\f    Case: 14-10949    Document: 00513567324     Page: 2   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10949\n      This appeal requires the court to address only the threshold issues of\njusticiability and subject matter jurisdiction under both Article III and the\nAPA. In dismissing Texas’s complaint, the district court held that Texas lacked\nArticle III standing to bring this action because Texas could not show a\nsubstantial likelihood of harm, noting that although the EEOC had the\nstatutory authority to investigate Title VII charges against Texas, it had no\nauthority to bring an enforcement action against the State, that authority\nbelonging only to the Attorney General of the United States. The district court\nfurther asserted that Texas’s challenge to the EEOC’s Enforcement Guidance\nwas unripe, and that, in any event, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\nover the APA claim because the EEOC’s Guidance did not constitute “final\nagency action” under 5 U.S.C. § 704.\n      Although the parties conflate the issues of standing, ripeness, and “final\nagency action” under the APA, Texas essentially argues that it has standing\nbecause it is an object of the challenged EEOC Guidance, and that the\nGuidance is a “final agency action” because it creates legal consequences for\nTexas and all other employers. Texas asserts that the Guidance implements a\nmandatory regulatory framework for employers and EEOC staff to follow, and\nthat the Guidance purports to preempt Texas state law. In response, the\nEEOC argues that the Guidance is purely advisory, and thus does not create\nan actual injury sufficient to confer standing. The EEOC further contends\nthat, because it cannot bring an enforcement action against Texas directly, the\nGuidance is not a “final agency action” under the APA.         In making this\nargument regarding “final agency action,” the EEOC relies heavily on several\nrecent decisions from this circuit. The EEOC’s arguments regarding ripeness\noverlap with its arguments regarding a lack of finality, as the EEOC\nessentially contends that Texas’s challenge to the Guidance is unripe until\nTexas faces a more certain threat of enforcement.\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 14-10949     Document: 00513567324      Page: 3   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10949\n      After full briefing and argument, we REVERSE the district court’s\njudgment and REMAND this action for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                        I.\n      Although this appeal presents only a jurisdictional issue, this action\nultimately seeks to question whether a bar on hiring felons constitutes an\nunlawful employment practice under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer:\n      (1) to fail or refuse to hire or discharge any individual, or otherwise\n      to discriminate against any individual with respect to his\n      compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n      because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\n      origin; or\n      (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for\n      employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive\n      any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n      adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such\n      individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).\n      Texas employs hundreds of thousands of people across various state\nagencies. Many of these state agencies do not hire convicted felons, felons\nconvicted of particular categories of felonies, or, in some cases, individuals\nconvicted of particular misdemeanors. The sources of these bans stem from\nboth Texas state statutes and longstanding employment policies adopted by\nthe agencies. According to Texas, its agencies apply the hiring bars neutrally\n“to all job applicants, without regard to their races.” Where these exclusions\nexist, however, Texas applies them categorically and does not undertake an\nindividualized assessment into the nature of the prospective employee’s\nconviction.\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f    Case: 14-10949    Document: 00513567324     Page: 4   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10949\n      Although the EEOC enforces Title VII, its enforcement power is limited\nin a number of respects that are relevant to this appeal. First, the EEOC has\nonly the limited regulatory authority “to issue, amend, or rescind suitable\nprocedural regulations to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.” 42\nU.S.C. § 2000e-12(a). In other words, the EEOC cannot promulgate binding\nsubstantive interpretations of Title VII. Second, the EEOC lacks the authority\nto file an enforcement action against a state employer directly. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-5(f)(1). The EEOC does, however, have the power to investigate state\nemployers for potential Title VII violations. The EEOC refers any case for\nwhich it finds reasonable cause to believe a Title VII violation occurred to the\nAttorney General of the United States, who then decides whether to bring\nenforcement action against the state. Id.\n      Notwithstanding its limitation to only formulating procedural rules, the\nEEOC holds and advances the view, as expressed through its policy\nstatements, that categorical bans on the hiring of felons can constitute a\nviolation of Title VII when they disproportionately affect blacks and Hispanics.\nIn 2012, the EEOC issued the “Enforcement Guidance on the Consideration of\nArrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964” (the “Enforcement Guidance” or the “Guidance”),\nwhich is at issue in this suit. The Enforcement Guidance provides that\n       [w]ith respect to criminal records, there is Title VII disparate\n      impact liability where the evidence shows that a covered\n      employer’s criminal record screening policy or practice\n      disproportionately screens out a Title VII-protected group and the\n      employer does not demonstrate that the policy or practice is job\n      related for the positions in question and consistent with business\n      necessity.\n      The Guidance then sets out a framework for addressing both whether a\nhiring policy screens out a Title VII-protected group and whether a policy is\n“consistent with business necessity.” On the first prong, the Guidance lays out\n                                       4\n\f     Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324         Page: 5    Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\nvarious criteria that the EEOC will use to determine whether a hiring policy\nhas a disparate impact, and asserts that an employer’s evidence of a racially\nbalanced workforce “will not be enough to disprove disparate impact.” On the\nsecond prong, the Guidance addresses the “job-related, business necessity”\ndefense by offering employers the details of a screening policy that creates a\ndisparate impact, but nonetheless complies with Title VII because it is\nnarrowly tailored to serve a legitimate business need.\n       Texas filed suit on November 4, 2013, and filed its amended complaint\non March 14, 2014. The amended complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, alleging that the Enforcement Guidance is, in effect, a binding\nsubstantive interpretation of Title VII and thus violates the APA. The EEOC\nmoved to dismiss the amended complaint on three jurisdictional grounds: (1)\nstanding; (2) ripeness; and (3) lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the\nAPA. The district court granted the motion to dismiss. Although the district\ncourt’s opinion cites all three grounds as independent bases for dismissal, the\ndistrict court addressed only in passing the issues of ripeness and jurisdiction\nunder the APA, and emphasized the lack of Article III standing. Texas filed a\ntimely appeal.\n                                             II.\n       First, we consider whether Texas has Article III standing. 1 Texas can\nsatisfy the constitutional elements of standing by “present[ing] (1) an actual or\nimminent injury that is concrete and particularized, (2) fairly traceable to the\ndefendant’s conduct, and (3) redressable by a judgment in [Texas’s] favor.”\n\n\n\n       1 The doctrine of standing is derived from Article III’s “Case[]” or “Controvers[y]”\nrequirement, and “‘the gist of the question of standing’ is whether [the party invoking\nstanding has] ‘such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that\nconcrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so\nlargely depended for illumination.’” Massachusetts v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 549 U.S. 497,\n517 (2007) (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962)).\n                                             5\n\f    Case: 14-10949     Document: 00513567324       Page: 6   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-10949\nDurante ex rel. Durante v. City of Lewisville, Tex., 759 F.3d 514, 517 (5th Cir.\n2014). A plaintiff must support each standing element “with the manner and\ndegree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.” Lujan v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). Thus, at the motion to dismiss\nstage, the court accepts as true all well-pleaded allegations concerning\nstanding. Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Tex. Med. Bd., 627 F.3d\n547, 550 (5th Cir. 2010).       The court reviews de novo a district court’s\ndetermination of standing. Contender Farms, L.L.P. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 779\nF.3d 258, 264 (5th Cir. 2015). Furthermore, because Texas is bringing this\naction in its capacity as a sovereign state being pressured to reevaluate state\nlaw or incur substantial costs, it “is entitled to special solicitude in our standing\nanalysis.” Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520.\n      Our discussion here begins with “a basic question that underlies all three\nelements of standing—‘whether the plaintiff is [itself] an object’” of the\nchallenged agency “rule.” Contender Farms, 779 F.3d at 264 (quoting Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 561). If a plaintiff can establish that it is an “object” of the agency\nregulation at issue, “there is ordinarily little question that the action or\ninaction has caused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment preventing or\nrequiring the action will redress it.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561–62. “[W]hether\nsomeone is in fact an object of a regulation is a flexible inquiry rooted in\ncommon sense.” See Contender Farms, 779 F.3d at 265.\n       We have no question but that Texas is an “object” of the challenged\nEnforcement Guidance, which, as we shall later see more fully, has a\nregulatory effect on employers. With the narrow exception of some federal\nagency employers, the Guidance purports to apply to all employers (including\nstate agencies) that conduct criminal background checks as part of their hiring\nprocess. Indeed, the EEOC effectively concedes that Texas—or any other\nemployer subject to Title VII, for that matter—is an object of the Guidance at\n                                         6\n\f    Case: 14-10949    Document: 00513567324      Page: 7   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10949\nissue, but nevertheless argues that Texas lacks standing to mount a legal\nchallenge to the Enforcement Guidance because, being purely advisory, the\nGuidance does not impose any obligations on Texas or expose it to any legal\nconsequences. In making this argument, the EEOC erroneously conflates the\nquestion of standing under Article III with the question of “final agency action”\nunder the APA. Although the two inquiries may engage similar concerns,\nconstitutional standing analysis is ultimately separate from the question of\nwhether “final agency action” exists within the meaning of § 704 of the APA.\nSee, e.g., Holistic Candlers and Consumers Ass’n v. Food & Drug Admin., 664\nF.3d 940, 943–45 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (concluding that the plaintiffs established\nconstitutional standing, but nonetheless finding that the plaintiffs failed to\nshow “final agency action” under the APA); see also Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S.\n154, 177–78 (1997) (noting that constitutional standing and “final agency\naction” are separate inquires).\n      As Texas is an object of the Guidance at issue, there is no reason to\ndeviate from the presumption that Texas has constitutional standing to\nchallenge it. The district court found that Texas lacked an injury sufficiently\nconcrete and imminent to confer standing because Texas did not allege that\nany enforcement action had been filed against it by the Department of Justice\n(“DOJ”). An enforcement action is not, however, the only injury sufficient to\nconfer constitutional standing upon Texas. Texas alleges several injuries that\nit is currently suffering because of the Guidance. First, Texas asserts that the\nGuidance imposes a mandatory scheme for employers regarding hiring\npolicies.   If we take these allegations as true, the Enforcement Guidance\namounts to an increased regulatory burden on Texas as an employer, and “[a]n\nincreased regulatory burden typically satisfies the injury in fact requirement.”\n\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\f     Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324         Page: 8    Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\nSee Contender Farms, 779 F.3d at 266 (citing Ass’n of Am. R.R.s v. Dep’t of\nTransp., 38 F.3d 582 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). 2\n       Texas further asserts that the Enforcement Guidance effectively\npreempts state laws that bar employee-applicants with certain criminal\nhistories from being considered for specific jobs, such as school teachers or state\nlaw enforcement officers.         Regardless of whether the Guidance actually\npreempts Texas’s laws regarding hiring bans, the Guidance does, at the very\nleast, force Texas to undergo an analysis, agency by agency, regarding whether\nthe certainty of EEOC investigations stemming from the Enforcement\nGuidance’s standards overrides the State’s interest in not hiring felons for\ncertain jobs. 3 Putting aside the question of whether these practical injuries\ntransform the Guidance into “final agency action” for the purposes of APA\njurisdiction, these injuries are sufficient to confer constitutional standing,\nespecially when considering Texas’s unique position as a sovereign state\ndefending its existing practices and threatened authority. See Texas v. United\nStates, 787 F.3d 733, 749 (5th Cir. 2015) (finding, in the context of an appeal\nof a denial of a stay, that the government failed to make a showing that Texas\nlacked standing to challenge another federal agency’s action when, as a result\nof that action, Texas faced a “forced choice between incurring costs and\nchanging its laws”). 4 As this court has stated before, “being pressured to\n\n\n       2 The dissent’s argument with respect to Article III standing—casting the Guidance\nas merely an expression of the EEOC’s view on Title VII—assumes that the Guidance is not\nbinding on EEOC staff in the performance of their official duties. As this opinion makes\nclear, however, the Guidance shows the opposite. These features of the Guidance are\ndiscussed more in depth infra Part III, as they are also crucial to the discussion of whether\nthe Guidance is “final agency action” under the APA.\n       3 Indeed, the EEOC admitted at oral argument that it intended to investigate\n\ndisparate impact complaints against Texas for non-compliance with the Guidance’s criminal\nbackground screening standards.\n       4 As stated, the court in Texas v. United States, 797 F.3d 733, affirmed the district\n\ncourt’s denial of a stay regarding an injunction against the Department of Homeland\nSecurity’s “DAPA” program, which made certain illegal aliens eligible for select federal\n                                             8\n\f     Case: 14-10949        Document: 00513567324           Page: 9     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-10949\nchange state law constitutes an injury” for the purpose of state standing\nanalysis. Id.; see also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d at 156–57 (concluding\nthat Texas had standing to challenge agency action even when it could avoid\nfinancial harm by changing its own laws and practices, and asserting that\n“[s]tates have a sovereign interest in the power to create and enforce a legal\ncode, and the possibility that a plaintiff could avoid injury by incurring other\ncosts does not negate standing” (internal quotations and citations omitted)).\n       In sum, the district court erred; Texas has constitutional standing to\nchallenge the Enforcement Guidance under the APA. Texas has standing\nbecause it is an object of the Guidance and, taking the complaint’s allegations\nas true, has alleged a sufficient injury in fact, that is that the Guidance forces\nTexas to alter its hiring policies or incur significant costs. The court now turns\nto whether the EEOC’s Enforcement Guidance is a “final agency action” under\nthe APA.\n                                              III.\n       The APA provides that “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of\nagency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the\nmeaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n\n\nbenefits. Texas asserted that, by virtue of becoming eligible for these federal benefits, illegal\naliens would also be entitled to driver’s licenses and state unemployment benefits, which\nwould raise state costs. The government contended that no injury existed, as DAPA did not,\non its own, require states to issue driver’s licenses or subsidize to account for increased costs.\nThis court, however, found that the government failed to show that Texas lacked standing,\nasserting that “Texas’s forced choice between incurring costs and changing its laws is an\ninjury because those laws exist for the administration of a state program, not to challenge\nfederal law, and Texas did not enact them merely to create standing.” Id; see also id. (citing\nwith approval a Sixth Circuit opinion that held “making the enforcement of an existing state\nlaw more difficult qualifies” as an injury for the purposes of Article III standing (citing State\nof Ohio ex rel. Celebrezze v. U.S. Dept. of Transp., 766 F.2d 228, 232–33 (6th Cir. 1985))). This\ncourt has since affirmed the district court’s grant of injunctive relief against DAPA,\nconcluding, for many of the same reasons, that Texas had standing. See Texas v. United\nStates, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015), aff’d by an equally divided Court, 579 U.S. ___, 2016 WL\n3434401 (June 23, 2016).\n                                                9\n\f    Case: 14-10949     Document: 00513567324      Page: 10    Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-10949\n§ 702. An aggrieved party is entitled to seek this review, however, only if the\nagency action is “made reviewable by statute” or, relevant to this appeal,\nwhether the action is “final agency action for which there is no other adequate\nremedy in a court.”      Id. § 704.   In this circuit, the “final agency action”\nrequirement is a jurisdictional threshold, not a merits inquiry. See Peoples\nNat’l Bank v. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States, 362\nF.3d 333, 336 (5th Cir. 2004) (“If there is no ‘final agency action,’ a federal court\nlacks subject matter jurisdiction.” (citing Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Herman, 176\nF.3d 283, 287 (5th Cir. 1999))).\n       An administrative action is “final agency action” under the APA if: (1)\nthe agency’s action is the “consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking\nprocess;” and (2) “the action must be one by which rights or obligations have\nbeen determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett, 520\nU.S. at 177–78 (internal quotation marks omitted). “In evaluating whether a\nchallenged agency action meets these two conditions, this court is guided by\nthe Supreme Court’s interpretation of the APA’s finality requirement as\n‘flexible’ and ‘pragmatic.’” Qureshi v. Holder, 663 F.3d 778, 781 (5th Cir. 2011)\n(quoting Abbott Labs. v. Gardener, 387 U.S. 136, 149–50 (1967)). The standard\nof review is de novo. Id. at 780. The parties do not appear to contest that the\nEnforcement Guidance is the “consummation” of the EEOC’s decisionmaking\nprocess. Thus, this appeal turns on the second prong of the Bennett test, and\nthe court must determine whether the EEOC Guidance constitutes an agency\naction “by which rights or obligations have been determined,” or, in the\nalternative, “from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett, 520 U.S. at\n178.\n                                         A.\n       The EEOC contends that the Guidance does not create “legal\nconsequences” because the EEOC lacks the authority to bring an enforcement\n                                         10\n\f    Case: 14-10949    Document: 00513567324      Page: 11   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10949\naction against Texas directly; that is, it can only refer a case to the U.S.\nAttorney General for prosecution following an EEOC investigation. Texas,\nhowever, asserts that the Guidance creates legal consequences that go beyond\nthe mere threat of investigation and agency referral.        Specifically, Texas\nargues that the Guidance itself creates legal consequences because it binds\nEEOC staff to a specific course of action, and asserts that an employer who\nadheres to one of the Guidance’s two “safe harbor” provisions will avoid a\nfinding of liability before the EEOC, and thus will avoid DOJ referral and\nenforcement. See Cohen v. United States, 578 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (“When\n‘the language of the [agency] document is such that private parties can rely on\nit as a norm or safe harbor by which to shape their actions, it can be binding\nas a practical matter.’” (quoting Gen. Elec. Co. v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 290\nF.3d 377, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2002)), vacated in part on other grounds, 599 F.3d 652\n(D.C. Cir. 2010)); see also U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., Inc.,\n136 S. Ct. 1807, 1814 (2016) (stating that an agency action creates “legal\nconsequences” when it “narrows the field of potential plaintiffs and limits the\npotential liability” that a regulated entity faces).\n      The alleged safe harbor provisions read as follows:\n      Two circumstances in which the Commission believes employers\n      will consistently meet the “job related and consistent with business\n      necessity” defense are as follows:\n      • The employer validates the criminal conduct screen for the\n        position in question per the Uniform Guidelines on Employee\n        Selection Procedures (Uniform Guidelines) standards (if data\n        about criminal conduct as related to subsequent work\n        performance is available and such validation is possible); or\n      • The employer develops a targeted screen considering at least\n        the nature of the crime, the time elapsed, and the nature of the\n        job (the three Green factors), and then provides an opportunity\n        for an individualized assessment for people excluded by the\n\n\n                                        11\n\f    Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324         Page: 12     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\n           screen to determine whether the policy as applied is job related\n           and consistent with business necessity.\nThe Enforcement Guidance clarifies what sort of individualized assessment is\nrequired by the second provision, 5 providing that such an assessment\n       would consist of notice to the individual that he has been screened\n       out because of a criminal conviction; an opportunity for the\n       individual to demonstrate that the exclusion should not be applied\n       due to his particular circumstances; and consideration by the\n       employer as to whether the additional information provided by the\n       individual warrants an exception to the exclusion . . . .\n       Reviewing the parties’ arguments, we find that the Guidance imposes\n“legal consequences” in the sense that the EEOC has committed itself to\napplying the Guidance when conducting enforcement and referral actions; in\nparticular, the Guidance suggests that its provisions are to be taken as\nconclusive, and offers only two escapes from an adverse EEOC determination.\nMoreover, the promulgation of the Guidance is an agency action by which\n“rights and obligations” have been determined: the agency has committed itself\nto following the Guidance, and has assured employers that if they conform\ntheir conduct to the Guidance’s “safe harbor” requirements, they will not be\ndeemed to be in violation of Title VII by EEOC investigators.                     Such an\nexoneration by EEOC investigators would, in turn, ensure that Texas is\nprotected from referral of its case to the U.S. Attorney General for prosecution,\nand, ultimately, from a potential finding of injunctive and/or monetary liability\nin a DOJ-led prosecution.\n       In defending the Guidance against the scrutiny of the federal courts, the\nEEOC comes down hard and often on the mantra that the Guidance is not final\n\n\n\n       5 The parties do not discuss the first safe harbor—the Uniform Guidelines on\nEmployee Selection Procedures—in any detail. Accordingly, the court also focuses on only\nthe second purported “safe harbor,” which flows in part from the Eighth Circuit’s analysis in\nGreen v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., 523 F.2d 1290 (8th Cir. 1975).\n                                             12\n\f    Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324          Page: 13     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-10949\nagency action because the EEOC cannot directly bring an enforcement action\nagainst Texas, since only the U.S. Attorney General can enforce Title VII\nagainst a sovereign state. But the Guidance is not simply limited to one or\nonly a few investigations conducted by the EEOC against Texas or some other\nstate. Instead, it is a blanket policy that the EEOC has committed itself to\napplying with respect to virtually all public and private employers. 6 The\nEEOC does not dispute that, as a general matter, agency “guidance” that\ncabins an agency’s discretion with respect to enforcement actions can be\nconsidered “final agency action.”          Holding that the Guidance is not “final\nagency action” simply because the EEOC cannot bring an enforcement action\nagainst Texas directly would stand for the proposition that whether a blanket\nagency rule is “final agency action” turns on the identity of the class of\nplaintiffs, instead of the nature, character, and effect of the rule in and of itself.\nIn other words, to hold that the Guidance is not “final agency action” solely\nbecause of the EEOC’s limited enforcement authority with respect to a state\nemployer is essentially to hold that there is no rule-related EEOC action\nagainst a state that is reviewable under the APA, even though the EEOC\nclearly can subject state employers to harms sufficient to confer Article III\nstanding. Accordingly, the “flexible” and “pragmatic” approach to assessing\nthe finality of agency action, see Qureshi, 663 F.3d at 781, leads to the\nconclusion that the Guidance is “final agency action” under § 704 of the APA.\n\n\n\n\n       6 Specifically, the Enforcement Guidance unambiguously states that “the [EEOC]\nintends this document for use . . . by EEOC staff who are investigating discrimination charges\ninvolving the use of criminal records in employment decisions.” Elsewhere, the Guidance\nasserts that “[t]he EEOC enforces Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination\nbased on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Thus, in practical terms, the\nEnforcement Guidance indicates that the EEOC staff will be bound to follow the Guidance’s\nstandards when making enforcement-related decisions.\n                                             13\n\f   Case: 14-10949     Document: 00513567324     Page: 14   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10949\n                                       B.\n                                       1.\n      The EEOC does not dispute that its staff would use the Guidance when\nconducting their official duties under Title VII. Nor does it dispute that, if\nemployers will conform their conduct to reflect the “safe harbors” set forth by\nthe Guidance, such employers would virtually always escape adverse EEOC\ndeterminations on charges of felony hiring discrimination, and thus effectively\nbe immunized from a DOJ-backed enforcement action. Still, the EEOC points\nto two cases of this court, Luminant Generation Co., L.L.C. v. United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, 757 F.3d 439, 442 (5th Cir. 2014), and Belle\nCo., L.L.C. v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 761 F.3d 383 (5th Cir.\n2014), judgment vacated by Kent Recycling Servs., LLC v. U.S. Army Corps of\nEngineers, ---S. Ct.---, 2016 WL 3128836 (June 6, 2016), which it argues\npreclude a holding that the Enforcement Guidance is “final agency action.”\n      We begin our review of this authority by noting that the Supreme Court\nrecently vacated this court’s judgment in Belle Co., and remanded the case for\nthis court to reconsider its holding in the light of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\nv. Hawkes Co., Inc., 136 S. Ct. 1807 (2016). In Belle Co., this court had held\nthat the Army Corps of Engineers’ “affirmative” jurisdictional determination\n(“JD”), which asserted that the plaintiff’s property development was subject to\nthe Clean Water Act’s (“CWA”) permitting requirements, did not create legal\nconsequences. See Belle Co., 761 F.3d at 394. The court had reasoned that the\nagency’s determination of its own authority did not create legal consequences\nbecause the determination merely notified the plaintiff that it was subject to\npermitting requirements. As this court then stated, the JD did nothing to alter\nthe plaintiff’s legal obligations, because “even if [the plaintiff] had never\nrequested the [determination] and instead had begun to fill [the land], it would\nnot have been immune to enforcement action by the Corps or EPA.” Id. at 391.\n                                       14\n\f   Case: 14-10949     Document: 00513567324      Page: 15   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10949\nIn everyday language, the plaintiff was no worse off after the JD issued than\nit was before.\n      In Hawkes Co., however, the Supreme Court rejected such reasoning and\neffectively reversed our decision in Belle Co. Under nearly identical facts, the\nCourt concluded that the Corps’ issuance of an “affirmative” JD, which, as in\nBelle Co., asserted that a petitioner’s property is subject to the CWA’s\npermitting requirements, is a “final agency action” under the APA because it\ncreates legal consequences. Hawkes Co., 136 S. Ct. at 1814. This is so, the\nSupreme Court observed, because if the Corps had issued a “negative” JD—\nthat is, a JD stating that the plaintiff’s property did not contain “waters of the\nUnited States”—the plaintiff would have been entitled to a five-year period of\nprotection from any government-brought CWA enforcement action. Id. In\nshort, the determination to issue the affirmative JD denied the plaintiffs the\nbenefits that would have flowed from a negative JD, and thus this effect\nconstituted “legal consequences” to the plaintiffs resulting from the affirmative\nJD. Id.\n      In reaching this holding, the Supreme Court once again emphasized that\na “pragmatic” approach must be taken when deciding whether an agency\naction is “final,” and thus subject to court review:\n            This conclusion tracks the “pragmatic” approach we have\n      long taken to finality. For example, in Frozen Food Express v.\n      United States, 351 U. S. 40 (1956), we considered the finality of an\n      order specifying which commodities the Interstate Commerce\n      Commission believed were exempt by statute from regulation, and\n      which it believed were not. Although the order “had no authority\n      except to give notice of how the Commission interpreted” the\n      relevant statute, and “would have effect only if and when a\n      particular action was brought against a particular carrier,” we\n      held    that      the   order   was    nonetheless    immediately\n      reviewable. . . . So too here, while no administrative or criminal\n      proceeding can be brought for failure to conform to the approved\n      JD itself, that final agency determination not only deprives\n                                       15\n\f    Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324         Page: 16     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\n       respondents of a five-year safe harbor from liability under the Act,\n       but warns that if they discharge pollutants onto their property\n       without obtaining a permit from the Corps, they do so at the risk\n       of significant criminal and civil penalties.\nId. at 1815 (internal citations omitted).\n       As the above passage applies to this case, an agency action can create\nlegal consequences even when the action, in itself, is disassociated with the\nfiling of an enforcement proceeding, and is not authority for the imposition of\ncivil or criminal penalties. Instead, “legal consequences” are created whenever\nthe challenged agency action has the effect of committing the agency itself to a\nview of the law that, in turn, forces the plaintiff either to alter its conduct, or\nexpose itself to potential liability. In Hawkes Co., this agency action was the\nissuance of a JD asserting that the plaintiff’s land was subject to the CWA’s\npermitting requirements, thus depriving the plaintiff of the agency-created\nsafe harbor and forcing the plaintiff to submit to the agency’s view or risk\nliability. Here, it is the EEOC’s promulgation of the Guidance, which offers\nregulated entities a safe harbor from DOJ referral, and thus ultimately from\nliability, only if employers alter their hiring policies to comply with the\nGuidance’s directives. 7\n\n\n       7 In a post-argument letter, submitted after the issuance of Hawkes Co. and pursuant\nto Fed. R. App. P. 28(j), the government argues—for the first time and without citation to\nauthority—that the Guidance does not create a safe harbor because the DOJ could always\ndisagree with a favorable EEOC finding, and thus bring an enforcement action against a\npublic employer even where the EEOC has first conducted an investigation and concluded\nthat no Title VII violation has occurred. We disagree, and note that Title VII’s enforcement\nprovision contemplates EEOC referral as a prerequisite for any DOJ-brought enforcement\naction. See 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f)(1) (“If the [EEOC] has been unable to secure from the\nrespondent a conciliation agreement acceptable to the [EEOC], the [EEOC] shall take no\nfurther action and shall refer the case to the Attorney General who may bring a civil action\nagainst such respondent in the appropriate United States district court.”); see also United\nStates v. South Carolina, 445 F. Supp. 1094, 1110 (D.S.C. 1977) (“It is also clear from the\nlanguage of Section [2000e-5] that individual complaints against public employers are to be\nbrought to the [EEOC] . . . and that the [EEOC] is to proceed with its ‘informal methods of\nconference, conciliation and persuasion.’ Only when such methods fail does authority shift to\nthe Attorney General, who is then empowered to bring a civil action. The Attorney General\n                                             16\n\f    Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324        Page: 17     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\n       As we earlier noted, the EEOC also points to a second Fifth Circuit\ndecision as suggesting a finding that the Guidance is not final agency action.\nSee Luminant, 757 F.3d 439. In Luminant, the plaintiff, an energy company,\nreceived two notices of violation (“NOVs”) from the EPA, asserting that two of\nits Texas-based power plants were emitting pollutants in violation of multiple\nprovisions of the Clean Air Act and the state-level implementation plan. This\ncourt held that a challenged EPA notice of violation (“NOV”) was not “final\nagency action” because the relevant federal statute, the Clean Air Act, and not\nthe NOV, set out the parties’ obligations.              Luminant, 757 F.3d at 442.\nSpecifically, the court reasoned that “adverse legal consequences will flow only\nif the district court determines that Luminant violated” the Clean Air Act. Id.\nPhrased differently, the court asserted that, so long as the EPA took no further\naction, “Luminant would have no new legal obligation imposed on it and would\nhave lost no right it otherwise enjoyed.” Id.\n       To the extent that the Supreme Court’s decision in Hawkes Co. does not\nalso undermine the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning in Luminant (principally, the\nSupreme Court’s emphasis on a “pragmatic approach” to assessing whether\nAPA review is appropriate, instead of reliance on formalistic criteria, such as\nwhether the agency decision itself imposes penalties or is binding on a court),\nwe find Luminant distinguishable from the instant case. The agency document\nin Luminant merely expressed the agency’s opinion about the legality of the\nplaintiff’s conduct; it did not, as here, commit the administrative agency to a\nspecific course of action should the plaintiff fail to comply with the agency’s\nview. Furthermore, the agency action in Luminant was limited to a fact-\n\n\n\nhas no authority to investigate such charges or to bring such actions on his own initiative,\nbut can only step in to sue public employers with respect to individual complaints when a\ncase is referred to him by the [EEOC] following the procedures prescribed in [42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-5].”), aff’d by 434 U.S. 1026 (1978).\n                                            17\n\f   Case: 14-10949    Document: 00513567324     Page: 18   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-10949\nspecific situation and a particular violator. In contrast, the Guidance here\nprovides an analytical framework that applies across the board to all\nemployers—including the hundreds of state agencies at issue in this suit,\nwhich employ hundreds of thousands of employees—and binds EEOC staff in\nlater actions. See Barrack Goldstrike Mines, Inc. v. Browner, 215 F.3d 45, 48–\n49 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (finding that “legal consequences” existed, even when no\nenforcement action had yet been threatened against the plaintiff, where the\nagency expressed a definitive agency position that applied to all facilities\nwithin its regulatory purview, and had the effect of requiring all regulated\nfacilities to undertake increased reporting and record-retention obligations or\nrisk enforcement actions and fines).       Furthermore, as earlier said, the\nGuidance’s safe harbor provisions set out rules that employers are to follow if\nthey wish to avoid legal consequences. Or, stated another way, an employer is\nassured protection from agency referral and prosecution—effectively immune\nto a government-backed enforcement action—if it conducts itself in the manner\nprescribed by the Guidance.\n      Finally, other factors distinguish the Guidance from the type of agency\naction that this court previously has indicated does not create legal\nconsequences. For example, the Enforcement Guidance does not simply repeat\nthe relevant provisions of Title VII.      Instead, the Guidance purports to\ninterpret authoritatively both the meaning of “disparate impact” in the context\nof employer hiring policies regarding criminal convictions and the scope of the\n“job related, business necessity” defense. This court has always considered\nsuch a distinction important when deciding whether agency action is “final”\nunder the APA. See Resident Council of Allen Parkway Vill. v. U.S. Dep’t of\nHous. & Urban Dev., 980 F.2d 1043, 1056 (5th Cir. 1993) (finding that the\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development’s “internal and informal”\ninterpretation of the relevant statutory term did not constitute “final agency\n                                      18\n\f    Case: 14-10949      Document: 00513567324      Page: 19    Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-10949\naction” under the APA, but adding that “[w]ere HUD to formally define the\nphrase [at issue] . . . [the plaintiffs] would undoubtedly have the right to\nreview HUD’s final agency action under § 702 [of the APA]”).\n                                         2.\n      In addition to relying on this court’s precedents, the EEOC also leans\nheavily on AT&T Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 270 F.3d\n973 (D.C. Cir. 2001), in asserting that its Enforcement Guidance is not “final\nagency action.” In AT&T, the D.C. Circuit considered whether language in the\nEEOC’s compliance manual regarding the calculation of pregnancy leave was\n“final agency action” under the APA.          The litigation ultimately concerned\nwhether the plaintiff employer was required to give former employees credit\ntowards their pensions for time missed due to pregnancy before the passage of\nthe Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1979 (the “PDA”). The plaintiff employer\nchallenged language in the EEOC’s compliance manual that stated that\ndenying   full   work    credit   for   pre-PDA    pregnancy     leave   was   “past\ndiscrimination” sufficient to constitute a “present violation of Title VII.” Id. at\n974–75. The plaintiff employer also challenged several letters that the EEOC\nsent to the plaintiff suggesting that its practices violated Title VII.          The\nplaintiff argued that the EEOC’s actions, taken as a whole, made clear that it\nreached a conclusion concerning the plaintiff employer’s policy, and that that\nconclusion was “final agency action” under the APA. Id. at 975.\n      The D.C. Circuit disagreed, however, and held that the EEOC’s conduct,\nincluding its statement in the compliance manual, was not “final agency\naction” under the APA. Id. at 976–77. In making this determination, the court\nnoted that the EEOC “has not inflicted any injury upon [the plaintiff employer]\nmerely by expressing its view of the law—a view that has force only to the\nextent the agency can persuade a court to the same conclusion.” Id. at 976.\nThe court also noted that legal consequences did not necessarily flow from the\n                                         19\n\f    Case: 14-10949     Document: 00513567324      Page: 20    Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-10949\nEEOC’s actions because “the EEOC is not bound to sue [the plaintiff\nemployer],” and because the compliance manual “does not say whether, how,\nagainst which companies, or under what circumstances the Commission will\nact upon [its] view.” Id.\n      The EEOC contends that, like the compliance manual in AT&T,\nEnforcement Guidance is not “final agency action” because it has the force of\nlaw only to the extent that a court presiding over any enforcement action\nagrees with it. In dwelling on this point, however, the EEOC evades the\nobvious differences. Most notably here, the Enforcement Guidance purports to\nbind the agency itself. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit recognized in AT&T that, had\nthe policy guidance at issue in that case intended to bind EEOC staff in their\nofficial conduct, instead of merely expressing the agency’s views with respect\nto employers’ actions, the Court would likely have reached a different\nconclusion:\n      Although there are . . . particular circumstances in which an\n      agency’s taking a legal position itself inflicts injury or forces a\n      party to change its behavior, such that taking that position may be\n      deemed final agency action, . . . this is not such a case. . . . Unlike\n      the EPA Guidance at issue in Appalachian Power, the EEOC\n      Compliance Manual [at issue in AT&T] does not affect the\n      regulated community. Whereas “EPA officials in the field [were]\n      bound to apply” the EPA Guidance . . . the EEOC is not bound to\n      sue AT&T.\nAT&T, 270 F.3d at 975–76 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).\n      The policy guidance in AT&T provided little to no insight concerning\nwhat the EEOC itself was obligated to do as a result of the agency’s expressed\nviewpoint. In contrast, the Guidance here provides an exhaustive procedural\nframework for EEOC officials to follow. 8 As explained supra Part III.A, by\n\n\n\n      8 Whereas the policy statement in AT&T consisted of little more than a fleeting\nsentence and imposed no obligations on EEOC staff, the Enforcement Guidance, which is\n                                         20\n\f    Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324        Page: 21     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\nbinding itself to the Guidance’s standards and directives, the EEOC has\nassured employers nation-wide, public and private, that, so long as they\nconform their conduct to the Guidance’s “safe harbor” requirements, they will\nnot be deemed to be in violation of Title VII by EEOC investigators. Thus, they\nwill avoid referral to the U.S. Attorney General for prosecution. This, in turn,\nguarantees employers that they will not face an ultimate finding of monetary\nor injunctive liability as a result of a government enforcement action.\n       For this reason, the EEOC errs in relying on AT&T to suggest that\nagency actions are “final” under the APA only when federal courts are later\nbound to give deference to the agency’s interpretation of the statute at issue.\nOf course, such a method is one way to show final agency action, but it is only\none way. See, e.g., Hawkes Co., 136 S. Ct. at 1815; Frozen Food, 351 U.S. at\n44–45. It is also sufficient that the Enforcement Guidance has the immediate\neffect of altering the rights and obligations of the “regulated community” (i.e.,\nvirtually all state and private employers) by offering them a detailed and\nconclusive means to avoid an adverse EEOC finding, and, by extension, agency\nreferral and a government-backed enforcement action.\n                                            C.\n       Finally, we address the major prop of the EEOC’s argument: because the\nEEOC has only investigatory authority over state employers, no action that\nthe EEOC might take with respect to state employers can be “final” for the\npurposes of review under the APA.             Implicit in this argument is the clear\nsuggestion that, although EEOC investigations undoubtedly subject employers\nto practical harms, no “legal consequences” sufficient to invoke APA\n\n\n\n\nover fifty pages in length, routinely uses mandatory language to convey the conduct expected\nof both EEOC staff and employers.\n                                            21\n\f   Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324     Page: 22        Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10949\njurisdiction flow from the mere initiation of an investigation into an employer’s\nhiring practices.\n      We can certainly agree that an agency’s decision to investigate a specific\nregulated entity, including the issuance of subpoenas related to that\ninvestigation, normally does not constitute “final agency action.” See Jobs,\nTraining, and Servs., Inc. v. E. Tex. Council of Gov’ts, 50 F.3d 1318, 1324 (5th\nCir. 1995) (citing Veldhoen v. U.S. Coast Guard, 35 F.3d 222, 225 (5th Cir.\n1994)).     Texas is not, however, simply challenging the prospect of an\ninvestigation by the EEOC.        Instead, it is challenging the Enforcement\nGuidance itself, which represents the legal standards that the EEOC applies\nwhen deciding when and how to conduct such an investigation, and what\npractices may require charges. The Guidance is an agency determination in its\nfinal form and is applicable to all employers nation-wide; it is not an\nintermediate step in a specific enforcement action that may or may not lead to\nconcrete injury. Indeed, when previously concluding that the threat of agency\ninvestigation is not a “legal consequence,” this court has relied heavily on the\nnotion    that   such   an   investigation   is   merely     an     initial,   relatively\ninconsequential step towards a definitive declaration of the petitioner’s legal\nrights and obligations regarding the dispute that prompted the investigation.\nSee Stockman v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 138 F.3d 144, 155 (5th Cir. 1998) (citing\nVeldhoen, 35 F.3d at 226). When, as here, the agency action being challenged\nis the promulgation of agency rules that mandate such investigations across\nthe entire regulated community, and provide a specific, detailed “safe harbor”\npractice by which the regulated community may avoid adverse agency findings\nand eventual DOJ-led prosecution, the agency has already acted definitively\nby altering both its own obligations and the rights of the regulated entities it\noversees.\n\n\n                                        22\n\f    Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324          Page: 23     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-10949\n                                             D.\n       We repeat ourselves to say that, in publishing the Enforcement Guidance\nat issue, the EEOC has enacted a policy statement couched in mandatory\nlanguage that is intended to apply to all employers.                 At no point in this\nlitigation has the EEOC contended that it does not intend to follow the\nGuidance to its full extent when carrying out its official duties.                        By\nnevertheless arguing that the Guidance cannot be reviewed, the EEOC exploits\nthe limitations of its enforcement authority, while denying that state agencies\nwill face legal consequences should they fail to follow the Enforcement\nGuidance’s directives.\n       The EEOC’s Guidance may well be a valid exercise of its authority. That\nconclusion has yet to be determined. To wholly deny judicial review, however,\nwould be to ignore the presumption of reviewability, and to disregard the\nSupreme Court’s instruction that courts should adopt a pragmatic approach\nfor the purposes of determining reviewability under the APA. Abbott Labs.,\n387 U.S. at 140 (stating that there is a presumption that judicial review is\navailable to one wronged by agency action); see also id. at 149. Accordingly, we\nfind that the Guidance is “final agency action” for the purposes of the APA. 9\n\n\n\n\n       9 Having determined that the Guidance is “final agency action” under the APA, it\nfollows naturally that Texas’s APA claim is ripe for review. See Jobs, Training & Servs., 50\nF.3d at 1325 (asserting that the ripeness doctrine overlaps with the finality requirement);\nsee also John Doe, Inc. v. Drug Enforcement Agency, 484 F.3d 561, 567 (D.C. Cir. 2007)\n(“Finality, ripeness, and exhaustion of administrative remedies are related, overlapping\ndoctrines that are analytically but not categorically distinct.”). Texas’s challenge to the\nEEOC Guidance is a purely legal one, and as such it is unnecessary to wait for further factual\ndevelopment before rendering a decision. See Roark & Hardee LP v. City of Austin, 522 F.3d\n533, 545 (5th Cir. 2008). Furthermore, Texas faces significant hardships should the court\ndecline to consider its claims. Taking Texas’s allegations as true, it must change its hiring\npractices to ensure compliance with the Guidance, or face the numerous adverse effects\nalready set forth.\n                                             23\n\f   Case: 14-10949     Document: 00513567324     Page: 24   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10949\n                                      IV.\n      To conclude, the district court erred in dismissing this action on\njusticiability and subject matter jurisdiction grounds.

HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n      I am not persuaded that this controversy meets Article III’s demand of\nripeness, injury, and adversarial engagement. Nor am I persuaded that we\nhave been called upon to review an action of the EEOC with sufficient finality\nto support our jurisdiction. Texas seeks to challenge an EEOC “Enforcement\nGuidance” document that the EEOC cannot enforce against it.                 This\ndescription should be enough to resolve this case. I must dissent.\n                                       I.\n      On April 25, 2012, the EEOC issued the “Enforcement Guidance on the\nConsideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions\nUnder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” The Guidance sets forth the\nEEOC’s legal position that “[a]n employer’s use of an individual’s criminal\nhistory in making employment decisions may, in some instances, violate the\nprohibition against employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964.” The Guidance’s principal observation is that blanket bans\non hiring individuals with criminal records—or “criminal record exclusions”—\nhave a disparate impact on minorities. As the majority recounts, the Guidance\nthus warns that blanket “criminal record exclusions” may violate Title VII\nunless they are “job related and consistent with business necessity.”\n      On November 4, 2013, the State of Texas filed a complaint seeking “[a]\ndeclaratory judgment holding unlawful and setting aside” the Guidance; and\n“[a] declaration and injunction that” the Department of Justice—the sole\ngovernment body that can sue a state employer—“may not issue right-to-sue\nletters to persons seeking to sue the State of Texas or any of its constituent\nagencies or state officials based on the interpretation of Title VII that appears\nin” the Guidance. The EEOC moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The\ndistrict court granted this motion, concluding that (1) Texas lacks standing to\n\n\n                                       25\n\f    Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324         Page: 26     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\nchallenge the Guidance; (2) the Guidance is not a “final agency action”; and (3)\nTexas’s challenge to the Guidance is not ripe. Texas appealed to this Court.\n                                             II.\n       This Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction if Texas does not have\nstanding to challenge the Guidance or if its challenge is not ripe. So, too, if the\nGuidance is not a “final agency action.” 1 Texas has the burden to establish\nthat all three of these distinct but complementary requirements have been\nsatisfied. 2\n                                             A.\n       The history of Title VII and the creation of the EEOC provides critical\ncontext for this case. Congress enacted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nto prohibit employers from “fail[ing] or refus[ing] to hire . . . any individual . . .\nbecause of . . . race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 3               The Act\n“created . . . the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,” headed by five\ncommissioners, who are “appointed by the President by and with the advice\nand consent of the Senate” and “not more than three of whom shall be members\nof the same political party.” 4 The EEOC’s original powers of enforcement did\nnot include the power to sue. On the contrary, the Commission was allowed\nonly to “make an investigation of” charges of discrimination and use informal\nmethods of “conference, conciliation, and persuasion” to bring employers into\ncompliance. 5 If these efforts failed, the Act authorized private suits “by the\nperson claiming to be aggrieved,” 6 but not by the EEOC.\n\n\n\n\n       See Qureshi v. Holder, 663 F.3d 778, 781 (5th Cir. 2011).\n       1\n\n       See, e.g., Choice Inc. of Tex. v. Greenstein, 691 F.3d 710, 714 (5th Cir. 2012).\n       2\n     3 Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L.

Any challenge to the employment practices of a\nstate employer can proceed only upon decision of the Attorney General, not the\nEEOC. This not only underscores the lack of a concrete controversy between\nthe State of Texas and the EEOC, but also accents the reality that this case\ntouches on sensitive political decisions bearing on the essence of dual\nsovereignty.    In service of this fault line of shared sovereignty, Congress\nconfined the power to sue states for violations of Title VII to a Cabinet-level\nmember of the incumbent administration, a delicate call upon its powers under\nthe Commerce Clause and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. 15 This\nstructure must signify in our analysis.\n                                            B.\n      Turning first to Article III, the want of an adversarial engagement here\nis palpable. “Under Article III, § 2, of the Constitution, the federal courts have\njurisdiction over this dispute between appellant[] and appellee[] only if it is a\n‘case’ or ‘controversy.’     This is a ‘bedrock requirement.’” 16          Indeed, “[n]o\n\n\n\n      14  Id., 86 Stat. 105 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1)).\n      15  See S.

Both require dismissal in this\ncase.\n        “[T]he ‘irreducible constitutional minimum’ of standing consists of three\nelements. The plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is\nfairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely\nto be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.” 18 While the Guidance is a\ncloud on the political horizon, it inflicts no injury upon Texas. The majority\nconcludes otherwise because Texas is the “object” of the EEOC’s action. 19 But\nthat assertion cannot be sustained. There is no doubt that the EEOC would\nprefer that Texas follow the Guidance, but it lacks the authority to bring a suit\nenforcing that preference. 20 The EEOC may refer a case against Texas to the\nAttorney General, but the Attorney General has no obligation to adhere to the\nGuidance. 21 And if the Attorney General or a private citizen sues Texas, the\nGuidance is entitled to Skidmore deference, 22 at best. 23 Indeed, as Texas fully\nconcedes, the EEOC does not have the authority to issue a binding\n\n\n\n\n        17 Id.

The Guidance is not a substantive regulation—it can\nneither dictate the outcome of a Title VII action nor preempt state law.\n       The facts here are also distinguishable from this Court’s recent decision\nin Texas v. United States. 25 In Texas v. United States, a divided panel of this\nCourt concluded that Texas had standing because it faced a “forced choice\nbetween incurring costs and changing its laws.” 26 Texas faces here no such\nchoice—there is no financial penalty if it declines to change its hiring policies\nbeyond the expense of a court proceeding, an expense it has elected to incur.\nIn sum, Texas is left with the argument that the EEOC has injured it by\nexpressing its view of the law. As the D.C.

Texas has raised an abstract challenge that is unmoored\nfrom a specific “criminal record exclusion,” or even a class of “criminal record\nexclusions.” To be sure, Texas sprinkles some facts into its briefing, but only\nto illustrate the alleged absurdity of the EEOC’s position—not to demonstrate\nthat a particular “criminal conduct exclusion” complies with Title VII. Such a\ntheoretical challenge is not fit for judicial decision. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas repeatedly warned that “[d]etermination of the scope . . . of legislation in\nadvance of its immediate adverse effect in the context of a concrete case\ninvolves too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the\njudicial function.” 32\n       Texas responds that the facts are irrelevant because “the whole point of\nthis suit is that the [Guidance] is facially invalid — irrespective of the factual\ncircumstances in which EEOC or DOJ might invoke it.” 33 That is, Texas\nargues that this Court need not consider a specific “criminal record exclusion”\nbecause “the EEOC does not have legal authority to regulate employers’\nrefusals to hire felons.” 34 But the Guidance does not just address the disparate\nimpact of the “blanket no felon-hiring policies” discussed in Texas’s briefing—\n\n\n       30  Ohio Forestry Ass’n v.

The Guidance,\nfor instance, contains an entire section about “Disparate Treatment\nDiscrimination and Criminal Records.” In this section, the Guidance explains\nthat “there is Title VII disparate treatment liability where the evidence shows\nthat a covered employer rejected an African American applicant based on his\ncriminal record but hired a similarly situated White applicant with a\ncomparable criminal record” and provides several clarifying examples. Unless\nTexas disagrees with this elementary legal proposition, it cannot seriously\ncontend that the Guidance is invalid “irrespective of the factual circumstances\nin which EEOC or DOJ might invoke it.” The validity of the Guidance must\nhinge on the specific circumstances in which it is deployed.\n       Moreover, the Supreme Court rejected an argument almost identical to\nthe one raised here in a previous dispute between the State of Texas and the\nFederal Government. In Texas v. United States, Texas argued that its pre-\nenforcement challenge to the Voting Rights Act was fit for review because it\n“asked [the Court] to hold that under no circumstances” was the relevant\nconduct subject to the Act. 35          The Supreme Court declined to accept this\ninvitation, explaining that it did “not have sufficient confidence in [its] powers\nof imagination to affirm such a negative.” The Court’s reasoning is just as\napplicable here: “The operation of the statute is better grasped when viewed in\nlight of a particular application.” 36 Regardless, Texas cannot show that it will\nsuffer any hardship if this Court withholds adjudication. 37 The Guidance does\nnot injure Texas in any way.

Even\nassuming the EEOC intends to sue every private employer who does not\ncomply with the Guidance, it can only refer a case against the State of Texas\nto the Attorney General. The possibility that the Attorney General may act on\nthat referral—and because of the non-binding Guidance—is not enough to\nmake Texas’s challenge ripe. As the Supreme Court has oft-repeated, “[a]\nclaim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon ‘contingent future events that\nmay not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.’” 38 In this respect,\nthe facts of this case are far different from those of Abbott Laboratories, where\nthe regulations under review had a “direct and immediate” impact on the\nplaintiffs and enforcement was a virtual certainty. 39 Rather, this Court faces\nfacts similar to those presented in one of its companion cases, Toilet Goods\nAss’n v. Gardner. 40        In Toilet Goods, the Court declined to review the\nchallenged regulation because it “ha[d] no idea whether or when” it would be\nenforced. 41 The Court explained that it “believe[d] that judicial appraisal [was]\nlikely to stand on a much surer footing in the context of a specific application\nof this regulation than could be the case in the framework of the generalized\nchallenge made here.” 42 This Court must abide by this seminal precedent.\n\n\n\n\n       38  Texas, 523 U.S. at 300 (quoting Thomas v.

The majority embraces Texas’s position, relying heavily\non the Supreme Court’s recent decision in United States Army Corps of\nEngineers v. Hawkes Co. 45\n      In Hawkes, the Court considered whether an “approved jurisdictional\ndetermination,” or JD, issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers qualifies\nas a final agency action.          The Corps issues JDs in conjunction with the\nenforcement of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits inter alia the discharge\nof pollutants into “the waters of the United States” without a permit. A JD\nadvises a property owner whether her piece of property contains “waters of the\nUnited States.”      It is “binding for five years on both the Corps and the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, which share authority to enforce the Clean\nWater Act.” As the Court noted, this is significant because “[t]he Clean Water\nAct imposes substantial criminal and civil penalties for discharging any\npollutant into waters covered by the Act without a permit from the Corps.” 46\nOn these facts, the Court readily concluded that a JD is a final agency action.\nThe Court explained that a “negative JD”—that is, “an approved JD stating\nthat a party’s property does not contain jurisdictional waters”—“creat[es] a\nfive-year safe harbor” from Clean Water Act enforcement. “In other words, a\nnegative JD both narrows the field of potential plaintiffs and limits the\npotential liability a landowner faces for discharging pollutants without a\npermit.”    And from that, “[i]t follows that affirmative JDs have legal\nconsequences as well: They represent the denial of the safe harbor that\nnegative JDs afford.” 47\n\n\n\n\n      45 136 S.

A negative JD is a legally binding\npromise that carries weighty consequences for the affected party. 48                         The\nGuidance does not carry any consequences for any party. To the contrary, it\nmerely expresses the EEOC’s view of the law, or the position that it may take\nin future enforcement actions. Texas insists that the Guidance goes further\nand creates two legally binding “safe harbors.” But the Guidance contains no\ndefinitive or mandatory language. Instead, it sets out “[t]wo circumstances in\nwhich the Commission believes employers will consistently meet the ‘job\nrelated and consistent with business necessity’ defense.” This mushy language\ncannot fairly be read as a promise to do anything. And even if it creates some\nlevel of practical pressure, this does not mean that it imposes legal\nconsequences. 49\n       There is, however, a more fundamental distinction between Hawkes and\nthe instant case. When the Corps issues a JD, it informs a specific party that\nit is or is not subject to the Clean Water Act. There is a direct engagement\nbetween the two parties concerning a specific tract of land that produces a\nbinding determination with salient and valuable consequences. In this case,\nthe EEOC has not taken any action against Texas—it has issued a general\nstatement of its view of the law. As the D.C. Circuit stated in a similar case:\n              In these circumstances, to allow [Texas] to institute\n       litigation with the Commission over the lawfulness of its policy\n       would be to preempt the Commission’s discretion to allocate its\n       resources as between this issue and this employer, as opposed to\n       other issues and other employers, as well as its ability to choose\n       the venue for its litigation, as the statute contemplates. See 42\n\n\n       48 See id.

Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 452 F.3d 798, 811\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (“The flaw in appellants’ argument is that the ‘consequences’ to which they\nallude are practical, not legal. . . . But de facto compliance is not enough to establish that the\nguidelines have had legal consequences.”).\n                                               36\n\f   Case: 14-10949         Document: 00513567324       Page: 37    Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\n      U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1), (f)(3). For the court to find here final agency\n      action subject to judicial review, therefore, would disrupt the\n      administrative process in a manner clearly at odds with the\n      contemplation of the Congress. 50\nThese concerns are compounded by Congress’s decision that the Attorney\nGeneral—not the EEOC—should determine whether and when to act against\na state employer. Hence, allowing Texas to proceed not only deprives the\nEEOC of resources that are designated for enforcement actions against private\nemployers—it interferes with the discretion of one of the highest-ranking\nmembers of the Executive Branch. “For the court to find here final agency\naction subject to judicial review, therefore, would disrupt the administrative\nprocess” in more ways than one.\n\n                                            III.\n     The majority’s opinion is not without purchase, but some basic principles\nbear repeating:\n             The Constitution allots the nation’s judicial power to the\n      federal courts. Unless these courts respect the limits of that\n      unique authority, they intrude upon powers vested in the\n      legislative or executive branches. Judicial adherence to the\n      doctrine of the separation of powers preserves the courts for the\n      decision of issues, between litigants, capable of effective\n      determination. Judicial exposition upon political proposals is\n      permissible only when necessary to decide definite issues between\n      litigants. When the courts act continually within these\n      constitutionally imposed boundaries of their power, their ability to\n      perform their function as a balance for the people’s protection\n      against abuse of power by other branches of government remains\n      unimpaired. Should the courts seek to expand their power so as to\n      bring under their jurisdiction ill defined controversies over\n\n\n\n\n      50   AT&T Co. v. EEOC, 270 F.3d 973, 976-77 (D.C.

The State of Texas seeks to challenge an “Enforcement Guidance”\nthat the EEOC lacks the ability to enforce against it. This Court should not\nallow such a nakedly political suit to proceed. That the Attorney General of a\nState may wish to jumpstart a political fight with the incumbent political party\nis far from unusual. It is also without surprise that the State’s suit here\nextends an invitation to the judiciary to join the fray. But this is an invitation\nwe must decline. With its “cases” and “controversies” command, Article III\nwalls in and walls out. Chief Justice Marshall taught that we have a duty to\ndecide—but that includes a duty to not do so in the absence of jurisdiction. 52\nIn dismissing this suit, the district court abided by this duty, a decision which,\nwith due respect to the Texas Attorney General and to our differing roles, if\noverturned would breach these aged walls. There the matter ought lie until a\ncase or controversy triggers our duty to resolve Texas’s not insubstantial\nchallenge to the EEOC’s view of the law. Until then, the political arena is the\nappropriate field of contest. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n       51  United Public Workers of America (C.I.O) v.

The EEOC has instigated no legal proceedings\nagainst the State of Texas regarding the subject of felony hiring bans and Title\nVII.\n\f    Case: 14-10949    Document: 00513567324     Page: 2   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10949\n      This appeal requires the court to address only the threshold issues of\njusticiability and subject matter jurisdiction under both Article III and the\nAPA. In dismissing Texas’s complaint, the district court held that Texas lacked\nArticle III standing to bring this action because Texas could not show a\nsubstantial likelihood of harm, noting that although the EEOC had the\nstatutory authority to investigate Title VII charges against Texas, it had no\nauthority to bring an enforcement action against the State, that authority\nbelonging only to the Attorney General of the United States. The district court\nfurther asserted that Texas’s challenge to the EEOC’s Enforcement Guidance\nwas unripe, and that, in any event, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\nover the APA claim because the EEOC’s Guidance did not constitute “final\nagency action” under 5 U.S.C. § 704.\n      Although the parties conflate the issues of standing, ripeness, and “final\nagency action” under the APA, Texas essentially argues that it has standing\nbecause it is an object of the challenged EEOC Guidance, and that the\nGuidance is a “final agency action” because it creates legal consequences for\nTexas and all other employers. Texas asserts that the Guidance implements a\nmandatory regulatory framework for employers and EEOC staff to follow, and\nthat the Guidance purports to preempt Texas state law. In response, the\nEEOC argues that the Guidance is purely advisory, and thus does not create\nan actual injury sufficient to confer standing. The EEOC further contends\nthat, because it cannot bring an enforcement action against Texas directly, the\nGuidance is not a “final agency action” under the APA.         In making this\nargument regarding “final agency action,” the EEOC relies heavily on several\nrecent decisions from this circuit. The EEOC’s arguments regarding ripeness\noverlap with its arguments regarding a lack of finality, as the EEOC\nessentially contends that Texas’s challenge to the Guidance is unripe until\nTexas faces a more certain threat of enforcement.\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 14-10949     Document: 00513567324      Page: 3   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10949\n      After full briefing and argument, we REVERSE the district court’s\njudgment and REMAND this action for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                        I.\n      Although this appeal presents only a jurisdictional issue, this action\nultimately seeks to question whether a bar on hiring felons constitutes an\nunlawful employment practice under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer:\n      (1) to fail or refuse to hire or discharge any individual, or otherwise\n      to discriminate against any individual with respect to his\n      compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n      because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\n      origin; or\n      (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for\n      employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive\n      any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n      adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such\n      individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).\n      Texas employs hundreds of thousands of people across various state\nagencies. Many of these state agencies do not hire convicted felons, felons\nconvicted of particular categories of felonies, or, in some cases, individuals\nconvicted of particular misdemeanors. The sources of these bans stem from\nboth Texas state statutes and longstanding employment policies adopted by\nthe agencies. According to Texas, its agencies apply the hiring bars neutrally\n“to all job applicants, without regard to their races.” Where these exclusions\nexist, however, Texas applies them categorically and does not undertake an\nindividualized assessment into the nature of the prospective employee’s\nconviction.\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f    Case: 14-10949    Document: 00513567324     Page: 4   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10949\n      Although the EEOC enforces Title VII, its enforcement power is limited\nin a number of respects that are relevant to this appeal. First, the EEOC has\nonly the limited regulatory authority “to issue, amend, or rescind suitable\nprocedural regulations to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.” 42\nU.S.C. § 2000e-12(a). In other words, the EEOC cannot promulgate binding\nsubstantive interpretations of Title VII. Second, the EEOC lacks the authority\nto file an enforcement action against a state employer directly. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-5(f)(1). The EEOC does, however, have the power to investigate state\nemployers for potential Title VII violations. The EEOC refers any case for\nwhich it finds reasonable cause to believe a Title VII violation occurred to the\nAttorney General of the United States, who then decides whether to bring\nenforcement action against the state. Id.\n      Notwithstanding its limitation to only formulating procedural rules, the\nEEOC holds and advances the view, as expressed through its policy\nstatements, that categorical bans on the hiring of felons can constitute a\nviolation of Title VII when they disproportionately affect blacks and Hispanics.\nIn 2012, the EEOC issued the “Enforcement Guidance on the Consideration of\nArrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964” (the “Enforcement Guidance” or the “Guidance”),\nwhich is at issue in this suit. The Enforcement Guidance provides that\n       [w]ith respect to criminal records, there is Title VII disparate\n      impact liability where the evidence shows that a covered\n      employer’s criminal record screening policy or practice\n      disproportionately screens out a Title VII-protected group and the\n      employer does not demonstrate that the policy or practice is job\n      related for the positions in question and consistent with business\n      necessity.\n      The Guidance then sets out a framework for addressing both whether a\nhiring policy screens out a Title VII-protected group and whether a policy is\n“consistent with business necessity.” On the first prong, the Guidance lays out\n                                       4\n\f     Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324         Page: 5    Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\nvarious criteria that the EEOC will use to determine whether a hiring policy\nhas a disparate impact, and asserts that an employer’s evidence of a racially\nbalanced workforce “will not be enough to disprove disparate impact.” On the\nsecond prong, the Guidance addresses the “job-related, business necessity”\ndefense by offering employers the details of a screening policy that creates a\ndisparate impact, but nonetheless complies with Title VII because it is\nnarrowly tailored to serve a legitimate business need.\n       Texas filed suit on November 4, 2013, and filed its amended complaint\non March 14, 2014. The amended complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, alleging that the Enforcement Guidance is, in effect, a binding\nsubstantive interpretation of Title VII and thus violates the APA. The EEOC\nmoved to dismiss the amended complaint on three jurisdictional grounds: (1)\nstanding; (2) ripeness; and (3) lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the\nAPA. The district court granted the motion to dismiss. Although the district\ncourt’s opinion cites all three grounds as independent bases for dismissal, the\ndistrict court addressed only in passing the issues of ripeness and jurisdiction\nunder the APA, and emphasized the lack of Article III standing. Texas filed a\ntimely appeal.\n                                             II.\n       First, we consider whether Texas has Article III standing. 1 Texas can\nsatisfy the constitutional elements of standing by “present[ing] (1) an actual or\nimminent injury that is concrete and particularized, (2) fairly traceable to the\ndefendant’s conduct, and (3) redressable by a judgment in [Texas’s] favor.”\n\n\n\n       1 The doctrine of standing is derived from Article III’s “Case[]” or “Controvers[y]”\nrequirement, and “‘the gist of the question of standing’ is whether [the party invoking\nstanding has] ‘such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that\nconcrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so\nlargely depended for illumination.’” Massachusetts v.

Furthermore, because Texas is bringing this\naction in its capacity as a sovereign state being pressured to reevaluate state\nlaw or incur substantial costs, it “is entitled to special solicitude in our standing\nanalysis.” Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520.\n      Our discussion here begins with “a basic question that underlies all three\nelements of standing—‘whether the plaintiff is [itself] an object’” of the\nchallenged agency “rule.” Contender Farms, 779 F.3d at 264 (quoting Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 561). If a plaintiff can establish that it is an “object” of the agency\nregulation at issue, “there is ordinarily little question that the action or\ninaction has caused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment preventing or\nrequiring the action will redress it.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561–62. “[W]hether\nsomeone is in fact an object of a regulation is a flexible inquiry rooted in\ncommon sense.” See Contender Farms, 779 F.3d at 265.\n       We have no question but that Texas is an “object” of the challenged\nEnforcement Guidance, which, as we shall later see more fully, has a\nregulatory effect on employers. With the narrow exception of some federal\nagency employers, the Guidance purports to apply to all employers (including\nstate agencies) that conduct criminal background checks as part of their hiring\nprocess. Indeed, the EEOC effectively concedes that Texas—or any other\nemployer subject to Title VII, for that matter—is an object of the Guidance at\n                                         6\n\f    Case: 14-10949    Document: 00513567324      Page: 7   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10949\nissue, but nevertheless argues that Texas lacks standing to mount a legal\nchallenge to the Enforcement Guidance because, being purely advisory, the\nGuidance does not impose any obligations on Texas or expose it to any legal\nconsequences. In making this argument, the EEOC erroneously conflates the\nquestion of standing under Article III with the question of “final agency action”\nunder the APA. Although the two inquiries may engage similar concerns,\nconstitutional standing analysis is ultimately separate from the question of\nwhether “final agency action” exists within the meaning of § 704 of the APA.\nSee, e.g., Holistic Candlers and Consumers Ass’n v. Food & Drug Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"620106\"><a href=\"/opinion/620106/holistic-candlers-and-consumers-assn-v-fda/\"><span class=\"volume\">664</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 943–45 (D.C.

The district court found that Texas lacked an injury sufficiently\nconcrete and imminent to confer standing because Texas did not allege that\nany enforcement action had been filed against it by the Department of Justice\n(“DOJ”). An enforcement action is not, however, the only injury sufficient to\nconfer constitutional standing upon Texas. Texas alleges several injuries that\nit is currently suffering because of the Guidance. First, Texas asserts that the\nGuidance imposes a mandatory scheme for employers regarding hiring\npolicies.   If we take these allegations as true, the Enforcement Guidance\namounts to an increased regulatory burden on Texas as an employer, and “[a]n\nincreased regulatory burden typically satisfies the injury in fact requirement.”\n\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\f     Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324         Page: 8    Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\nSee Contender Farms, 779 F.3d at 266 (citing Ass’n of Am.

Cir. 1994)). 2\n       Texas further asserts that the Enforcement Guidance effectively\npreempts state laws that bar employee-applicants with certain criminal\nhistories from being considered for specific jobs, such as school teachers or state\nlaw enforcement officers.         Regardless of whether the Guidance actually\npreempts Texas’s laws regarding hiring bans, the Guidance does, at the very\nleast, force Texas to undergo an analysis, agency by agency, regarding whether\nthe certainty of EEOC investigations stemming from the Enforcement\nGuidance’s standards overrides the State’s interest in not hiring felons for\ncertain jobs. 3 Putting aside the question of whether these practical injuries\ntransform the Guidance into “final agency action” for the purposes of APA\njurisdiction, these injuries are sufficient to confer constitutional standing,\nespecially when considering Texas’s unique position as a sovereign state\ndefending its existing practices and threatened authority. See Texas v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 749 (5th Cir. 2015) (finding, in the context of an appeal\nof a denial of a stay, that the government failed to make a showing that Texas\nlacked standing to challenge another federal agency’s action when, as a result\nof that action, Texas faced a “forced choice between incurring costs and\nchanging its laws”). 4 As this court has stated before, “being pressured to\n\n\n       2 The dissent’s argument with respect to Article III standing—casting the Guidance\nas merely an expression of the EEOC’s view on Title VII—assumes that the Guidance is not\nbinding on EEOC staff in the performance of their official duties. As this opinion makes\nclear, however, the Guidance shows the opposite. These features of the Guidance are\ndiscussed more in depth infra Part III, as they are also crucial to the discussion of whether\nthe Guidance is “final agency action” under the APA.\n       3 Indeed, the EEOC admitted at oral argument that it intended to investigate\n\ndisparate impact complaints against Texas for non-compliance with the Guidance’s criminal\nbackground screening standards.\n       4 As stated, the court in Texas v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, affirmed the district\n\ncourt’s denial of a stay regarding an injunction against the Department of Homeland\nSecurity’s “DAPA” program, which made certain illegal aliens eligible for select federal\n                                             8\n\f     Case: 14-10949        Document: 00513567324           Page: 9     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-10949\nchange state law constitutes an injury” for the purpose of state standing\nanalysis.

Texas has standing\nbecause it is an object of the Guidance and, taking the complaint’s allegations\nas true, has alleged a sufficient injury in fact, that is that the Guidance forces\nTexas to alter its hiring policies or incur significant costs. The court now turns\nto whether the EEOC’s Enforcement Guidance is a “final agency action” under\nthe APA.\n                                              III.\n       The APA provides that “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of\nagency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the\nmeaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n\n\nbenefits.

Specifically, Texas\nargues that the Guidance itself creates legal consequences because it binds\nEEOC staff to a specific course of action, and asserts that an employer who\nadheres to one of the Guidance’s two “safe harbor” provisions will avoid a\nfinding of liability before the EEOC, and thus will avoid DOJ referral and\nenforcement.

Such an\nexoneration by EEOC investigators would, in turn, ensure that Texas is\nprotected from referral of its case to the U.S. Attorney General for prosecution,\nand, ultimately, from a potential finding of injunctive and/or monetary liability\nin a DOJ-led prosecution.\n       In defending the Guidance against the scrutiny of the federal courts, the\nEEOC comes down hard and often on the mantra that the Guidance is not final\n\n\n\n       5 The parties do not discuss the first safe harbor—the Uniform Guidelines on\nEmployee Selection Procedures—in any detail. Accordingly, the court also focuses on only\nthe second purported “safe harbor,” which flows in part from the Eighth Circuit’s analysis in\nGreen v.

But the Guidance is not simply limited to one or\nonly a few investigations conducted by the EEOC against Texas or some other\nstate. Instead, it is a blanket policy that the EEOC has committed itself to\napplying with respect to virtually all public and private employers. 6 The\nEEOC does not dispute that, as a general matter, agency “guidance” that\ncabins an agency’s discretion with respect to enforcement actions can be\nconsidered “final agency action.”          Holding that the Guidance is not “final\nagency action” simply because the EEOC cannot bring an enforcement action\nagainst Texas directly would stand for the proposition that whether a blanket\nagency rule is “final agency action” turns on the identity of the class of\nplaintiffs, instead of the nature, character, and effect of the rule in and of itself.\nIn other words, to hold that the Guidance is not “final agency action” solely\nbecause of the EEOC’s limited enforcement authority with respect to a state\nemployer is essentially to hold that there is no rule-related EEOC action\nagainst a state that is reviewable under the APA, even though the EEOC\nclearly can subject state employers to harms sufficient to confer Article III\nstanding. Accordingly, the “flexible” and “pragmatic” approach to assessing\nthe finality of agency action, see Qureshi, 663 F.3d at 781, leads to the\nconclusion that the Guidance is “final agency action” under § 704 of the APA.\n\n\n\n\n       6 Specifically, the Enforcement Guidance unambiguously states that “the [EEOC]\nintends this document for use . . . by EEOC staff who are investigating discrimination charges\ninvolving the use of criminal records in employment decisions.” Elsewhere, the Guidance\nasserts that “[t]he EEOC enforces Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination\nbased on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Thus, in practical terms, the\nEnforcement Guidance indicates that the EEOC staff will be bound to follow the Guidance’s\nstandards when making enforcement-related decisions.\n                                             13\n\f   Case: 14-10949     Document: 00513567324     Page: 14   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10949\n                                       B.\n                                       1.\n      The EEOC does not dispute that its staff would use the Guidance when\nconducting their official duties under Title VII. Nor does it dispute that, if\nemployers will conform their conduct to reflect the “safe harbors” set forth by\nthe Guidance, such employers would virtually always escape adverse EEOC\ndeterminations on charges of felony hiring discrimination, and thus effectively\nbe immunized from a DOJ-backed enforcement action.

Hawkes Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3207861\"><a href=\"/opinion/3207967/army-corps-of-engineers-v-hawkes-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1807</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016). In Belle Co., this court had held\nthat the Army Corps of Engineers’ “affirmative” jurisdictional determination\n(“JD”), which asserted that the plaintiff’s property development was subject to\nthe Clean Water Act’s (“CWA”) permitting requirements, did not create legal\nconsequences. See Belle Co., 761 F.3d at 394. The court had reasoned that the\nagency’s determination of its own authority did not create legal consequences\nbecause the determination merely notified the plaintiff that it was subject to\npermitting requirements. As this court then stated, the JD did nothing to alter\nthe plaintiff’s legal obligations, because “even if [the plaintiff] had never\nrequested the [determination] and instead had begun to fill [the land], it would\nnot have been immune to enforcement action by the Corps or EPA.” Id. at 391.\n                                       14\n\f   Case: 14-10949     Document: 00513567324      Page: 15   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10949\nIn everyday language, the plaintiff was no worse off after the JD issued than\nit was before.\n      In Hawkes Co., however, the Supreme Court rejected such reasoning and\neffectively reversed our decision in Belle Co. Under nearly identical facts, the\nCourt concluded that the Corps’ issuance of an “affirmative” JD, which, as in\nBelle Co., asserted that a petitioner’s property is subject to the CWA’s\npermitting requirements, is a “final agency action” under the APA because it\ncreates legal consequences. Hawkes Co., 136 S. Ct. at 1814. This is so, the\nSupreme Court observed, because if the Corps had issued a “negative” JD—\nthat is, a JD stating that the plaintiff’s property did not contain “waters of the\nUnited States”—the plaintiff would have been entitled to a five-year period of\nprotection from any government-brought CWA enforcement action. Id. In\nshort, the determination to issue the affirmative JD denied the plaintiffs the\nbenefits that would have flowed from a negative JD, and thus this effect\nconstituted “legal consequences” to the plaintiffs resulting from the affirmative\nJD. Id.\n      In reaching this holding, the Supreme Court once again emphasized that\na “pragmatic” approach must be taken when deciding whether an agency\naction is “final,” and thus subject to court review:\n            This conclusion tracks the “pragmatic” approach we have\n      long taken to finality. For example, in Frozen Food Express v.\n      United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105383\"><a href=\"/opinion/105383/frozen-food-express-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1956), we considered the finality of an\n      order specifying which commodities the Interstate Commerce\n      Commission believed were exempt by statute from regulation, and\n      which it believed were not. Although the order “had no authority\n      except to give notice of how the Commission interpreted” the\n      relevant statute, and “would have effect only if and when a\n      particular action was brought against a particular carrier,” we\n      held    that      the   order   was    nonetheless    immediately\n      reviewable. . . . So too here, while no administrative or criminal\n      proceeding can be brought for failure to conform to the approved\n      JD itself, that final agency determination not only deprives\n                                       15\n\f    Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324         Page: 16     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\n       respondents of a five-year safe harbor from liability under the Act,\n       but warns that if they discharge pollutants onto their property\n       without obtaining a permit from the Corps, they do so at the risk\n       of significant criminal and civil penalties.\nId. at 1815 (internal citations omitted).\n       As the above passage applies to this case, an agency action can create\nlegal consequences even when the action, in itself, is disassociated with the\nfiling of an enforcement proceeding, and is not authority for the imposition of\ncivil or criminal penalties. Instead, “legal consequences” are created whenever\nthe challenged agency action has the effect of committing the agency itself to a\nview of the law that, in turn, forces the plaintiff either to alter its conduct, or\nexpose itself to potential liability. In Hawkes Co., this agency action was the\nissuance of a JD asserting that the plaintiff’s land was subject to the CWA’s\npermitting requirements, thus depriving the plaintiff of the agency-created\nsafe harbor and forcing the plaintiff to submit to the agency’s view or risk\nliability. Here, it is the EEOC’s promulgation of the Guidance, which offers\nregulated entities a safe harbor from DOJ referral, and thus ultimately from\nliability, only if employers alter their hiring policies to comply with the\nGuidance’s directives. 7\n\n\n       7 In a post-argument letter, submitted after the issuance of Hawkes Co. and pursuant\nto Fed. R. App. P. 28(j), the government argues—for the first time and without citation to\nauthority—that the Guidance does not create a safe harbor because the DOJ could always\ndisagree with a favorable EEOC finding, and thus bring an enforcement action against a\npublic employer even where the EEOC has first conducted an investigation and concluded\nthat no Title VII violation has occurred. We disagree, and note that Title VII’s enforcement\nprovision contemplates EEOC referral as a prerequisite for any DOJ-brought enforcement\naction. See 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f)(1) (“If the [EEOC] has been unable to secure from the\nrespondent a conciliation agreement acceptable to the [EEOC], the [EEOC] shall take no\nfurther action and shall refer the case to the Attorney General who may bring a civil action\nagainst such respondent in the appropriate United States district court.”); see also United\nStates v.

In Luminant, the plaintiff, an energy company,\nreceived two notices of violation (“NOVs”) from the EPA, asserting that two of\nits Texas-based power plants were emitting pollutants in violation of multiple\nprovisions of the Clean Air Act and the state-level implementation plan. This\ncourt held that a challenged EPA notice of violation (“NOV”) was not “final\nagency action” because the relevant federal statute, the Clean Air Act, and not\nthe NOV, set out the parties’ obligations.              Luminant, 757 F.3d at 442.\nSpecifically, the court reasoned that “adverse legal consequences will flow only\nif the district court determines that Luminant violated” the Clean Air Act. Id.\nPhrased differently, the court asserted that, so long as the EPA took no further\naction, “Luminant would have no new legal obligation imposed on it and would\nhave lost no right it otherwise enjoyed.” Id.\n       To the extent that the Supreme Court’s decision in Hawkes Co. does not\nalso undermine the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning in Luminant (principally, the\nSupreme Court’s emphasis on a “pragmatic approach” to assessing whether\nAPA review is appropriate, instead of reliance on formalistic criteria, such as\nwhether the agency decision itself imposes penalties or is binding on a court),\nwe find Luminant distinguishable from the instant case. The agency document\nin Luminant merely expressed the agency’s opinion about the legality of the\nplaintiff’s conduct; it did not, as here, commit the administrative agency to a\nspecific course of action should the plaintiff fail to comply with the agency’s\nview. Furthermore, the agency action in Luminant was limited to a fact-\n\n\n\nhas no authority to investigate such charges or to bring such actions on his own initiative,\nbut can only step in to sue public employers with respect to individual complaints when a\ncase is referred to him by the [EEOC] following the procedures prescribed in [42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-5].”), aff’d by </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978).\n                                            17\n\f   Case: 14-10949    Document: 00513567324     Page: 18   Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-10949\nspecific situation and a particular violator.

Furthermore, as earlier said, the\nGuidance’s safe harbor provisions set out rules that employers are to follow if\nthey wish to avoid legal consequences. Or, stated another way, an employer is\nassured protection from agency referral and prosecution—effectively immune\nto a government-backed enforcement action—if it conducts itself in the manner\nprescribed by the Guidance.\n      Finally, other factors distinguish the Guidance from the type of agency\naction that this court previously has indicated does not create legal\nconsequences. For example, the Enforcement Guidance does not simply repeat\nthe relevant provisions of Title VII.      Instead, the Guidance purports to\ninterpret authoritatively both the meaning of “disparate impact” in the context\nof employer hiring policies regarding criminal convictions and the scope of the\n“job related, business necessity” defense.

Circuit considered whether language in the\nEEOC’s compliance manual regarding the calculation of pregnancy leave was\n“final agency action” under the APA.          The litigation ultimately concerned\nwhether the plaintiff employer was required to give former employees credit\ntowards their pensions for time missed due to pregnancy before the passage of\nthe Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1979 (the “PDA”). The plaintiff employer\nchallenged language in the EEOC’s compliance manual that stated that\ndenying   full   work    credit   for   pre-PDA    pregnancy     leave   was   “past\ndiscrimination” sufficient to constitute a “present violation of Title VII.” Id. at\n974–75. The plaintiff employer also challenged several letters that the EEOC\nsent to the plaintiff suggesting that its practices violated Title VII.          The\nplaintiff argued that the EEOC’s actions, taken as a whole, made clear that it\nreached a conclusion concerning the plaintiff employer’s policy, and that that\nconclusion was “final agency action” under the APA. Id. at 975.\n      The D.C. Circuit disagreed, however, and held that the EEOC’s conduct,\nincluding its statement in the compliance manual, was not “final agency\naction” under the APA. Id. at 976–77. In making this determination, the court\nnoted that the EEOC “has not inflicted any injury upon [the plaintiff employer]\nmerely by expressing its view of the law—a view that has force only to the\nextent the agency can persuade a court to the same conclusion.” Id. at 976.\nThe court also noted that legal consequences did not necessarily flow from the\n                                         19\n\f    Case: 14-10949     Document: 00513567324      Page: 20    Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-10949\nEEOC’s actions because “the EEOC is not bound to sue [the plaintiff\nemployer],” and because the compliance manual “does not say whether, how,\nagainst which companies, or under what circumstances the Commission will\nact upon [its] view.” Id.\n      The EEOC contends that, like the compliance manual in AT&T,\nEnforcement Guidance is not “final agency action” because it has the force of\nlaw only to the extent that a court presiding over any enforcement action\nagrees with it. In dwelling on this point, however, the EEOC evades the\nobvious differences. Most notably here, the Enforcement Guidance purports to\nbind the agency itself. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit recognized in AT&T that, had\nthe policy guidance at issue in that case intended to bind EEOC staff in their\nofficial conduct, instead of merely expressing the agency’s views with respect\nto employers’ actions, the Court would likely have reached a different\nconclusion:\n      Although there are . . . particular circumstances in which an\n      agency’s taking a legal position itself inflicts injury or forces a\n      party to change its behavior, such that taking that position may be\n      deemed final agency action, . . . this is not such a case. . . . Unlike\n      the EPA Guidance at issue in Appalachian Power, the EEOC\n      Compliance Manual [at issue in AT&T] does not affect the\n      regulated community. Whereas “EPA officials in the field [were]\n      bound to apply” the EPA Guidance . . . the EEOC is not bound to\n      sue AT&T.\nAT&T, 270 F.3d at 975–76 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).\n      The policy guidance in AT&T provided little to no insight concerning\nwhat the EEOC itself was obligated to do as a result of the agency’s expressed\nviewpoint. In contrast, the Guidance here provides an exhaustive procedural\nframework for EEOC officials to follow. 8 As explained supra Part III.A, by\n\n\n\n      8 Whereas the policy statement in AT&T consisted of little more than a fleeting\nsentence and imposed no obligations on EEOC staff, the Enforcement Guidance, which is\n                                         20\n\f    Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324        Page: 21     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\nbinding itself to the Guidance’s standards and directives, the EEOC has\nassured employers nation-wide, public and private, that, so long as they\nconform their conduct to the Guidance’s “safe harbor” requirements, they will\nnot be deemed to be in violation of Title VII by EEOC investigators. Thus, they\nwill avoid referral to the U.S. Attorney General for prosecution. This, in turn,\nguarantees employers that they will not face an ultimate finding of monetary\nor injunctive liability as a result of a government enforcement action.\n       For this reason, the EEOC errs in relying on AT&T to suggest that\nagency actions are “final” under the APA only when federal courts are later\nbound to give deference to the agency’s interpretation of the statute at issue.\nOf course, such a method is one way to show final agency action, but it is only\none way. See, e.g., Hawkes Co., 136 S. Ct. at 1815; Frozen Food, 351 U.S. at\n44–45. It is also sufficient that the Enforcement Guidance has the immediate\neffect of altering the rights and obligations of the “regulated community” (i.e.,\nvirtually all state and private employers) by offering them a detailed and\nconclusive means to avoid an adverse EEOC finding, and, by extension, agency\nreferral and a government-backed enforcement action.\n                                            C.\n       Finally, we address the major prop of the EEOC’s argument: because the\nEEOC has only investigatory authority over state employers, no action that\nthe EEOC might take with respect to state employers can be “final” for the\npurposes of review under the APA.             Implicit in this argument is the clear\nsuggestion that, although EEOC investigations undoubtedly subject employers\nto practical harms, no “legal consequences” sufficient to invoke APA\n\n\n\n\nover fifty pages in length, routinely uses mandatory language to convey the conduct expected\nof both EEOC staff and employers.\n                                            21\n\f   Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324     Page: 22        Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10949\njurisdiction flow from the mere initiation of an investigation into an employer’s\nhiring practices.\n      We can certainly agree that an agency’s decision to investigate a specific\nregulated entity, including the issuance of subpoenas related to that\ninvestigation, normally does not constitute “final agency action.” See Jobs,\nTraining, and Servs., Inc. v. E. Tex.

Texas is not, however, simply challenging the prospect of an\ninvestigation by the EEOC.        Instead, it is challenging the Enforcement\nGuidance itself, which represents the legal standards that the EEOC applies\nwhen deciding when and how to conduct such an investigation, and what\npractices may require charges. The Guidance is an agency determination in its\nfinal form and is applicable to all employers nation-wide; it is not an\nintermediate step in a specific enforcement action that may or may not lead to\nconcrete injury. Indeed, when previously concluding that the threat of agency\ninvestigation is not a “legal consequence,” this court has relied heavily on the\nnotion    that   such   an   investigation   is   merely     an     initial,   relatively\ninconsequential step towards a definitive declaration of the petitioner’s legal\nrights and obligations regarding the dispute that prompted the investigation.\nSee Stockman v.

When, as here, the agency action being challenged\nis the promulgation of agency rules that mandate such investigations across\nthe entire regulated community, and provide a specific, detailed “safe harbor”\npractice by which the regulated community may avoid adverse agency findings\nand eventual DOJ-led prosecution, the agency has already acted definitively\nby altering both its own obligations and the rights of the regulated entities it\noversees.\n\n\n                                        22\n\f    Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324          Page: 23     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-10949\n                                             D.\n       We repeat ourselves to say that, in publishing the Enforcement Guidance\nat issue, the EEOC has enacted a policy statement couched in mandatory\nlanguage that is intended to apply to all employers.                 At no point in this\nlitigation has the EEOC contended that it does not intend to follow the\nGuidance to its full extent when carrying out its official duties.                        By\nnevertheless arguing that the Guidance cannot be reviewed, the EEOC exploits\nthe limitations of its enforcement authority, while denying that state agencies\nwill face legal consequences should they fail to follow the Enforcement\nGuidance’s directives.\n       The EEOC’s Guidance may well be a valid exercise of its authority. That\nconclusion has yet to be determined. To wholly deny judicial review, however,\nwould be to ignore the presumption of reviewability, and to disregard the\nSupreme Court’s instruction that courts should adopt a pragmatic approach\nfor the purposes of determining reviewability under the APA. Abbott Labs.,\n387 U.S. at 140 (stating that there is a presumption that judicial review is\navailable to one wronged by agency action); see also id. at 149. Accordingly, we\nfind that the Guidance is “final agency action” for the purposes of the APA. 9\n\n\n\n\n       9 Having determined that the Guidance is “final agency action” under the APA, it\nfollows naturally that Texas’s APA claim is ripe for review. See Jobs, Training & Servs., 50\nF.3d at 1325 (asserting that the ripeness doctrine overlaps with the finality requirement);\nsee also John Doe, Inc. v.

Furthermore, Texas faces significant hardships should the court\ndecline to consider its claims.

HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n      I am not persuaded that this controversy meets Article III’s demand of\nripeness, injury, and adversarial engagement. Nor am I persuaded that we\nhave been called upon to review an action of the EEOC with sufficient finality\nto support our jurisdiction. Texas seeks to challenge an EEOC “Enforcement\nGuidance” document that the EEOC cannot enforce against it.                 This\ndescription should be enough to resolve this case. I must dissent.\n                                       I.\n      On April 25, 2012, the EEOC issued the “Enforcement Guidance on the\nConsideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions\nUnder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” The Guidance sets forth the\nEEOC’s legal position that “[a]n employer’s use of an individual’s criminal\nhistory in making employment decisions may, in some instances, violate the\nprohibition against employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964.” The Guidance’s principal observation is that blanket bans\non hiring individuals with criminal records—or “criminal record exclusions”—\nhave a disparate impact on minorities. As the majority recounts, the Guidance\nthus warns that blanket “criminal record exclusions” may violate Title VII\nunless they are “job related and consistent with business necessity.”\n      On November 4, 2013, the State of Texas filed a complaint seeking “[a]\ndeclaratory judgment holding unlawful and setting aside” the Guidance; and\n“[a] declaration and injunction that” the Department of Justice—the sole\ngovernment body that can sue a state employer—“may not issue right-to-sue\nletters to persons seeking to sue the State of Texas or any of its constituent\nagencies or state officials based on the interpretation of Title VII that appears\nin” the Guidance. The EEOC moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The\ndistrict court granted this motion, concluding that (1) Texas lacks standing to\n\n\n                                       25\n\f    Case: 14-10949       Document: 00513567324         Page: 26     Date Filed: 06/27/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-10949\nchallenge the Guidance; (2) the Guidance is not a “final agency action”; and (3)\nTexas’s challenge to the Guidance is not ripe. Texas appealed to this Court.\n                                             II.\n       This Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction if Texas does not have\nstanding to challenge the Guidance or if its challenge is not ripe. So, too, if the\nGuidance is not a “final agency action.” 1 Texas has the burden to establish\nthat all three of these distinct but complementary requirements have been\nsatisfied. 2\n                                             A.\n       The history of Title VII and the creation of the EEOC provides critical\ncontext for this case. Congress enacted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nto prohibit employers from “fail[ing] or refus[ing] to hire . . . any individual . . .\nbecause of . . . race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 3               The Act\n“created . . . the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,” headed by five\ncommissioners, who are “appointed by the President by and with the advice\nand consent of the Senate” and “not more than three of whom shall be members\nof the same political party.” 4 The EEOC’s original powers of enforcement did\nnot include the power to sue. On the contrary, the Commission was allowed\nonly to “make an investigation of” charges of discrimination and use informal\nmethods of “conference, conciliation, and persuasion” to bring employers into\ncompliance. 5 If these efforts failed, the Act authorized private suits “by the\nperson claiming to be aggrieved,” 6 but not by the EEOC.\n\n\n\n\n       See Qureshi v.

In service of this fault line of shared sovereignty, Congress\nconfined the power to sue states for violations of Title VII to a Cabinet-level\nmember of the incumbent administration, a delicate call upon its powers under\nthe Commerce Clause and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. 15 This\nstructure must signify in our analysis.\n                                            B.\n      Turning first to Article III, the want of an adversarial engagement here\nis palpable. “Under Article III, § 2, of the Constitution, the federal courts have\njurisdiction over this dispute between appellant[] and appellee[] only if it is a\n‘case’ or ‘controversy.’     This is a ‘bedrock requirement.’” 16          Indeed, “[n]o\n\n\n\n      14  Id., 86 Stat. 105 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1)).\n      15  See S.

The Guidance is not a substantive regulation—it can\nneither dictate the outcome of a Title VII action nor preempt state law.\n       The facts here are also distinguishable from this Court’s recent decision\nin Texas v. United States. 25 In Texas v. United States, a divided panel of this\nCourt concluded that Texas had standing because it faced a “forced choice\nbetween incurring costs and changing its laws.” 26 Texas faces here no such\nchoice—there is no financial penalty if it declines to change its hiring policies\nbeyond the expense of a court proceeding, an expense it has elected to incur.\nIn sum, Texas is left with the argument that the EEOC has injured it by\nexpressing its view of the law. As the D.C. Circuit has observed, “an injury\ntypically is not caused when an agency merely expresses its view of what the\nlaw requires of a party, even if that view is adverse to the party.” 27 This is the\n“typical[]” case.\n                                              C.\n       Texas’s challenge is also not ripe.

Texas has raised an abstract challenge that is unmoored\nfrom a specific “criminal record exclusion,” or even a class of “criminal record\nexclusions.” To be sure, Texas sprinkles some facts into its briefing, but only\nto illustrate the alleged absurdity of the EEOC’s position—not to demonstrate\nthat a particular “criminal conduct exclusion” complies with Title VII. Such a\ntheoretical challenge is not fit for judicial decision. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas repeatedly warned that “[d]etermination of the scope . . . of legislation in\nadvance of its immediate adverse effect in the context of a concrete case\ninvolves too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the\njudicial function.” 32\n       Texas responds that the facts are irrelevant because “the whole point of\nthis suit is that the [Guidance] is facially invalid — irrespective of the factual\ncircumstances in which EEOC or DOJ might invoke it.” 33 That is, Texas\nargues that this Court need not consider a specific “criminal record exclusion”\nbecause “the EEOC does not have legal authority to regulate employers’\nrefusals to hire felons.” 34 But the Guidance does not just address the disparate\nimpact of the “blanket no felon-hiring policies” discussed in Texas’s briefing—\n\n\n       30  Ohio Forestry Ass’n v.

The Guidance,\nfor instance, contains an entire section about “Disparate Treatment\nDiscrimination and Criminal Records.” In this section, the Guidance explains\nthat “there is Title VII disparate treatment liability where the evidence shows\nthat a covered employer rejected an African American applicant based on his\ncriminal record but hired a similarly situated White applicant with a\ncomparable criminal record” and provides several clarifying examples. Unless\nTexas disagrees with this elementary legal proposition, it cannot seriously\ncontend that the Guidance is invalid “irrespective of the factual circumstances\nin which EEOC or DOJ might invoke it.” The validity of the Guidance must\nhinge on the specific circumstances in which it is deployed.\n       Moreover, the Supreme Court rejected an argument almost identical to\nthe one raised here in a previous dispute between the State of Texas and the\nFederal Government. In Texas v. United States, Texas argued that its pre-\nenforcement challenge to the Voting Rights Act was fit for review because it\n“asked [the Court] to hold that under no circumstances” was the relevant\nconduct subject to the Act. 35          The Supreme Court declined to accept this\ninvitation, explaining that it did “not have sufficient confidence in [its] powers\nof imagination to affirm such a negative.” The Court’s reasoning is just as\napplicable here: “The operation of the statute is better grasped when viewed in\nlight of a particular application.” 36 Regardless, Texas cannot show that it will\nsuffer any hardship if this Court withholds adjudication. 37 The Guidance does\nnot injure Texas in any way.

A JD\nadvises a property owner whether her piece of property contains “waters of the\nUnited States.”      It is “binding for five years on both the Corps and the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, which share authority to enforce the Clean\nWater Act.” As the Court noted, this is significant because “[t]he Clean Water\nAct imposes substantial criminal and civil penalties for discharging any\npollutant into waters covered by the Act without a permit from the Corps.” 46\nOn these facts, the Court readily concluded that a JD is a final agency action.\nThe Court explained that a “negative JD”—that is, “an approved JD stating\nthat a party’s property does not contain jurisdictional waters”—“creat[es] a\nfive-year safe harbor” from Clean Water Act enforcement. “In other words, a\nnegative JD both narrows the field of potential plaintiffs and limits the\npotential liability a landowner faces for discharging pollutants without a\npermit.”    And from that, “[i]t follows that affirmative JDs have legal\nconsequences as well: They represent the denial of the safe harbor that\nnegative JDs afford.” 47\n\n\n\n\n      45 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3207861\"><a href=\"/opinion/3207967/army-corps-of-engineers-v-hawkes-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A negative JD is a legally binding\npromise that carries weighty consequences for the affected party. 48                         The\nGuidance does not carry any consequences for any party. To the contrary, it\nmerely expresses the EEOC’s view of the law, or the position that it may take\nin future enforcement actions. Texas insists that the Guidance goes further\nand creates two legally binding “safe harbors.” But the Guidance contains no\ndefinitive or mandatory language. Instead, it sets out “[t]wo circumstances in\nwhich the Commission believes employers will consistently meet the ‘job\nrelated and consistent with business necessity’ defense.” This mushy language\ncannot fairly be read as a promise to do anything. And even if it creates some\nlevel of practical pressure, this does not mean that it imposes legal\nconsequences. 49\n       There is, however, a more fundamental distinction between Hawkes and\nthe instant case. When the Corps issues a JD, it informs a specific party that\nit is or is not subject to the Clean Water Act. There is a direct engagement\nbetween the two parties concerning a specific tract of land that produces a\nbinding determination with salient and valuable consequences. In this case,\nthe EEOC has not taken any action against Texas—it has issued a general\nstatement of its view of the law. As the D.C. Circuit stated in a similar case:\n              In these circumstances, to allow [Texas] to institute\n       litigation with the Commission over the lawfulness of its policy\n       would be to preempt the Commission’s discretion to allocate its\n       resources as between this issue and this employer, as opposed to\n       other issues and other employers, as well as its ability to choose\n       the venue for its litigation, as the statute contemplates.

For the court to find here final agency\n      action subject to judicial review, therefore, would disrupt the\n      administrative process in a manner clearly at odds with the\n      contemplation of the Congress. 50\nThese concerns are compounded by Congress’s decision that the Attorney\nGeneral—not the EEOC—should determine whether and when to act against\na state employer. Hence, allowing Texas to proceed not only deprives the\nEEOC of resources that are designated for enforcement actions against private\nemployers—it interferes with the discretion of one of the highest-ranking\nmembers of the Executive Branch. “For the court to find here final agency\naction subject to judicial review, therefore, would disrupt the administrative\nprocess” in more ways than one.\n\n                                            III.\n     The majority’s opinion is not without purchase, but some basic principles\nbear repeating:\n             The Constitution allots the nation’s judicial power to the\n      federal courts. Unless these courts respect the limits of that\n      unique authority, they intrude upon powers vested in the\n      legislative or executive branches. Judicial adherence to the\n      doctrine of the separation of powers preserves the courts for the\n      decision of issues, between litigants, capable of effective\n      determination. Judicial exposition upon political proposals is\n      permissible only when necessary to decide definite issues between\n      litigants. When the courts act continually within these\n      constitutionally imposed boundaries of their power, their ability to\n      perform their function as a balance for the people’s protection\n      against abuse of power by other branches of government remains\n      unimpaired.

The State of Texas seeks to challenge an “Enforcement Guidance”\nthat the EEOC lacks the ability to enforce against it. This Court should not\nallow such a nakedly political suit to proceed. That the Attorney General of a\nState may wish to jumpstart a political fight with the incumbent political party\nis far from unusual. It is also without surprise that the State’s suit here\nextends an invitation to the judiciary to join the fray. But this is an invitation\nwe must decline. With its “cases” and “controversies” command, Article III\nwalls in and walls out. Chief Justice Marshall taught that we have a duty to\ndecide—but that includes a duty to not do so in the absence of jurisdiction. 52\nIn dismissing this suit, the district court abided by this duty, a decision which,\nwith due respect to the Texas Attorney General and to our differing roles, if\noverturned would breach these aged walls. There the matter ought lie until a\ncase or controversy triggers our duty to resolve Texas’s not insubstantial\nchallenge to the EEOC’s view of the law. Until then, the political arena is the\nappropriate field of contest. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n       51  United Public Workers of America (C.I.O) v.
