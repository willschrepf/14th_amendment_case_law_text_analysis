The Hafens\n\ncontend the trial court abused its discretion by awarding Nielsen $65,898 of the $179,000\n\nin fees she requested. Specifically, the Hafens argue the trial court abused its discretion\n\nin apportioning Nielsen’s fees between her defense involving a fee-bearing agreement\n\nthat the Hafens alleged created an equitable servitude on her property and her defense\n\nagainst the Hafens’ claims involving prescription and an alleged equitable servitude\n\narising from an agreement without a fee provision. In essence, the Hafens challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court’s order, and they attack in particular\n\nthe credibility of Nielsen’s attorney, Edward M. Picozzi, in attesting to his fee allocations\n\nfor the work he performed. We affirm the order.\n\n                                              I\n\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n              This action concerns adjoining, hilltop parcels in Trabuco Canyon,\n\nCalifornia. The Hafens own a single-family residence with panoramic views in all\n\ndirections on one parcel, located at 30021 Canyon Creek Drive (30021). The best views\n\nfrom that residence are to the west across the undeveloped, adjacent parcel located at\n30022 Canyon Creek Drive (30022). The only flat area readily suitable for building a\n\nhome on 30022 is the portion nearest 30021. Development on this flat area would\n\nsignificantly impact the view west from the Hafens’ home on 30021.\n\n              Nielsen purchased 30022 in May 2005 from Michael Meacher. The next\n\nmonth, in June 2005, Meacher faxed Nielsen a copy of a purported January 2005\n\nagreement he entered with the Hafens (the Meacher agreement), calling for an exchange\n\nof the flat area on 30022 for an unspecified portion of the Hafens’ property. The\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fMeacher agreement also referenced a 2001 agreement (the Moshenko agreement)\n\nbetween former owners of 30021 and 30022 that similarly called for a land-exchange\n\nbetween the two parcels to “keep” the views from each “unobstructed.” The Moshenko\n\nagreement included an attorney fee provision; the Meacher agreement did not.\n\n              Nielsen refused to be bound by either agreement because the land exchange\n\nwould preclude building a residence on her property and she knew nothing of the\n\nagreements before her purchase. The Hafens sued Nielsen in June 2005.\n\n              The operative second amended complaint alleged five causes of action\n\nagainst Nielsen on the theory both the Meacher agreement and Moshenko agreement\n\nwere enforceable against her as equitable servitudes.1 The first and second causes of\n\naction sought specific performance and declaratory relief regarding the land exchange\n\nand view easements described in the Meacher agreement. The third cause of action\n\nalleged the Hafens acquired a prescriptive easement for the nonexclusive use of 30022’s\n\nflat area because the Hafens and their predecessors continually used the area for\n\napproximately 20 years. If the Meacher agreement’s land exchange and view easements\n\ncould not be enforced for any reason, the fourth and fifth causes of action sought specific\n\nperformance and declaratory relief regarding the Moshenko agreements’ view easements.\n\n\n\n\n       1       “An equitable servitude is a restriction on the use of real property that is\nenforceable even though not imposed as a covenant in the manner provided by law. The\ndoctrine of equitable servitudes arose as a means of giving effect to restrictions that did\nnot meet the stringent legal standards required for covenants running with the land.”\n(8 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate (3d ed. 2009) § 24:1 at p. 24–4.) When a covenant\ndoes not run with the land, it nonetheless may be enforced against a subsequent owner as\nan equitable servitude if (1) the subsequent owner took title with knowledge of the\ncovenant’s terms, and (2) it would be inequitable to permit the subsequent owner to avoid\nthe restrictions the covenant imposed. (Marra v. Aetna Constr. Co. (1940) 15 Cal.2d\n375, 378; Richardson v. Callahan (1931) 213 Cal. 683, 686–687.)\n\n                                             3\n\f              Following a bench trial, the trial court declined to enforce either the\n\nMoshenko agreement or the Meacher agreement as an equitable servitude and entered\n\njudgment in Nielsen’s favor. In its statement of decision, the trial court found Nielsen\n\nhad no actual or imputed knowledge of the Meacher agreement and the evidence did not\n\ncreate a duty for her to investigate the existence of an agreement regarding view\n\neasements or a land exchange. The trial court also found that (1) the Meacher agreement\n\ncould not be enforced as a covenant running with the land because the parties failed to\n\nrecord it and (2) the Moshenko agreement could not be enforced because the Meacher\n\nagreement rescinded it. The trial court made no express ruling in its statement of\n\ndecision on the Hafens’ prescriptive easement cause of action.\n\n              The Hafens appealed, omitting any challenge regarding their prescriptive\n\neasement claim, and we affirmed the judgment in an unpublished opinion. (Hafen v.\n\nNielsen (G043337, June 30, 2011) [nonpub. opn.] (Hafen I).)\n\n              Based on the Moshenko agreement attorney fees provision, Nielsen filed a\n\nmotion to recover the attorney fees she incurred defending the Hafens’ claims. The trial\n\ncourt granted the motion, but awarded just $1,050 of the $179,900 Nielsen sought,\n\napportioning three hours of attorney time billed at Nielsen’s lawyer’s $350 hourly rate.\nThe court’s minute order explained, “The only basis for recovery of attorney fees is\n\ncontained in the 2001 Moshenko agreement. That agreement had been expressly\n\nrescinded and never was recorded so could not be enforced against [Nielsen]. The fees\n\nattributable to that agreement must be apportioned.”\n\n              When Nielsen appealed, we affirmed the necessity of apportioning her\n\nattorney fees to (1) issues relating exclusively to the Moshenko agreement or (2) issues\n\ncommon to the Moshenko agreement and the Meacher agreement or the prescriptive\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\feasement claim. (Hafen v. Nielsen (G044204, Nov. 28, 2011) [nonpub. opn.], p. 13\n\n(Hafen II).) We reversed the trial court’s apportionment of just $1,050 to these matters\n\nbecause the court mistakenly concluded the absence of a formal covenant running with\n\nthe land virtually eliminated attorney fees.\n\n              The trial court had reasoned, “‘This issue [] I think could have been done in\n\na half hour. [¶] . . . [¶] As soon as someone told me, hey, there’s a statute that says\n\ncovenants running with the land have to be recorded, that’s the end of [that aspect of] the\n\ncase. [¶] . . . [¶] The amount of time you would have to address [the Moshenko\n\nagreement claims] compared to the rest of the case is almost zero. It’s very minimal.\n\nThat cause of action would have been out in a minute.’” (Hafen II, supra, at p. 11.) We\n\nexplained, however, that an agreement running with the land, although unrecorded, may\n\nnevertheless be enforced as an equitable servitude, provided the subsequent owner took\n\ntitle with knowledge of the covenant’s terms and it would be inequitable to permit the\n\nsubsequent owner to avoid the covenant’s restrictions. (Id. at p. 12; see fn. 1 ante.)\n\n              On remand to reapportion the fees, the former trial judge had retired,\n\nleaving the new judge in, as he noted, “the unenviable position of ruling on a motion for\n\nattorney fees on a case in which it was never involved pre-judgment.” The parties\nsubmitted their briefing and declarations concerning fees, but the trial court had to\n\ncontinue the hearing because Nielsen’s attorney, Edward Picozzi, forgot to attach his\n\nbilling statements. After the parties submitted supplemental declarations and briefing,\n\nincluding Picozzi’s billing statements, the trial court concluded in its tentative decision\n\nthat Nielsen was entitled to approximately $66,000 of her nearly $180,000 in claimed\n\nfees, but the tentative awarded no fees for time spent in trial because Picozzi “provide[d]\n\nabsolutely no hours [apportioning his trial time] despite a second chance to do so via the\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fSupplemental Declaration.” At the hearing, the trial court granted Picozzi’s request to\n\nfile a further declaration, which he did, and the parties again briefed the issue, and the\n\ntrial court re-heard the matter, taking it under submission.\n\n              The trial court issued a very detailed order denying Nielsen her fees during\n\ntrial, but awarding nearly $66,000 in pretrial fees supported by Picozzi’s billing statement\n\nand declarations.2 The court’s order explained: “The Court finds a total of 188.28 hours\n\nwere spent on issues relating exclusively to the 2001 [Moshenko] Agreement and issues\n\ncommon to the 2001 [Moshenko] Agreement and either the 2005 [Meacher] Agreement\n\nor the prescriptive easement claim. The court also finds Mr. Picozzi’s hourly rate of\n\n$350 an hour over the course of five years to be very reasonable. Therefore, the total\n\namount of fees allowed is $65,898.00.”\n\n              The trial court meticulously specified the allocations for which it allowed\n\nand disallowed fees. For example, “[a]s to procedural issues such as Mediation[,] Status\n\nConferences, CMCs, Telephone Conferences with Client, Telephone Conferences with\n\nCounsel: The Court will allow all time and fees requested by Mr. Picozzi, . . . since these\n\nthings pertain to the entire case, and allocation is absolutely impossible. [¶] Mediation:\n\n10.2 [hours] [¶] Status Conferences, MSC: 58.20+6.5 = 65.70 [¶] Telephone\nConferences w/ client: 14.95 [¶] Telephone Conferences w/ Counsel: 14.85.”\n\n(Original underlining.)\n\n              The other categories in which the court allowed fees consisted of: “As to\n\nthe Plaintiff’s Ex Parte TRO and Preliminary Injunction Efforts: The Court will also\n\nallow the 46.7 hours as sought by Mr. Picozzi. If this TRO was sought at the outset of\n\nthe litigation, Plaintiffs would have used the existence of both agreements to show the\n\n       2      The trial court also awarded Nielsen $19,250 in fees for her appeal in\nHafen II, and the Hafens do not challenge that fee award.\n\n                                              6\n\fexistence of an easement. This is something which does not appear easy to allocate. [¶]\n\n. . . [¶] Time for Site Inspection in the amount of 10.88 hours is allowed as viewing the\n\nland would go to all causes of action. . . . [¶] As to Depositions, Mr. Picozzi suggests\n\n58 hours were spent. He essentially guesses at how much time is spent on the fee-\n\nallowing agreement and cross-over issues. He suggests 70 percent, but this is a guess.\n\nBecause Mr. Picozzi does not give a number of specific hours, the Court will allow\n\n25 hours time — which represents about half of the time sought.” (Original underlining.)\n\n                The trial court rejected Nielsen’s fee request in the following categories:\n\n“As to Legal research, it is difficult to see how very many issues would overlap. It\n\nshould not have taken 14.6 hours to discover the 2001 [Moshenko] Agreement (which\n\nallowed for fees) was essentially rescinded by virtue of the 2005 [Meacher] Agreement\n\nbeing signed. As research has not been broken down specifically to 2001 [Moshenko]\n\nAgreement and overlap, the Court will deny the request for 14.6 hours. [¶] . . . [¶] As for\n\ntime spent for trial, Mr. Picozzi provides absolutely no meaningful evidentiary support\n\nfor fees for time spent in trial, despite various opportunities to do so via Supplemental\n\nDeclarations. Mr. Picozzi does not support his claim for apportionment with anything\n\nother than his own recollection and figures. There is no real reference to billing\nstatements, court transcript[s], etc. Therefore, fees for trial are not allowed.” (Original\n\nunderlining.)\n\n                Concluding its order, the trial court explained: “Adding up all the hours,\n\nthe Court arrives at the sum of 188.28 total hours spent on fee-allowing agreement and\n\ncross-over issues which are so inextricably linked that allocation is impossible.” The\n\ntrial court awarded Nielsen attorney fees at $350 an hour multiplied by 188.28 hours for a\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\ftotal of $65,898, and the Hafens now appeal. Nielsen does not appeal the hours\n\ndisallowed.\n\n                                              II\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Standard of Review\n\n              As we noted in Hafen II, the standard of review is well-established.\n\n“‘California courts have long held that trial courts have broad discretion in determining\n\nthe amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award. This determination is necessarily ad\n\nhoc and must be resolved on the particular circumstances of each case.’ [Citation.] In\n\nexercising its discretion, the trial court may accordingly ‘consider all of the facts and the\n\nentire procedural history of the case in setting the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee\n\naward.’ [Citation.]” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379,\n\n1394.) “An attorney fees award ‘“will not be overturned in the absence of a manifest\n\nabuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.”’” (Ibid.)\n\n               “Where a cause of action based on the contract providing for attorney’s\n\nfees is joined with other causes of action beyond the contract, the prevailing party may\nrecover attorney’s fees under [Civil Code] section 1717 only as they relate to the contract\n\naction. [Citations.]” (Reynolds Metals Co. v. Alperson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 124, 129\n\n(Reynolds).) Accordingly, a prevailing party seeking contractual attorney fees generally\n\nmust apportion fees between claims supporting the recovery of attorney fees and those\n\nthat do not. (Amtower v. Photon Dynamics, Inc. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1582, 1603-\n\n1604 (Amtower).)\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f              But a litigant’s “joinder of causes of action should not dilute its right to\n\nattorney’s fees. Attorney’s fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation\n\non an issue common to both a cause of action in which fees are proper and one in which\n\nthey are not allowed. All expenses incurred with respect to [issues common to all causes\n\nof action] qualify for award.” (Reynolds, supra, 25 Cal.3d at pp. 129-130.) “Where fees\n\nare authorized for some causes of action in a complaint but not for others, allocation is a\n\nmatter within the trial court's discretion.” (Amtower, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at p. 1604;\n\nThompson Pacific Construction, Inc. v. City of Sunnyvale (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 525,\n\n555.)\n\n              As the trial court observed, “[i]n challenges to the reasonableness of the\n\nnumber of hours billed, ‘it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific\n\nitems challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.’” (Premier\n\nMedical Management Systems, Inc. v. Caifornia Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008)\n\n163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564 (Premier).) The Hafens challenge the number of hours the\n\ntrial court awarded in every category it identified, and we examine each of these\n\nchallenges in turn.\n\nB.      Procedural Issues\n              The Hafens challenge the hours the trial court grouped together as\n\n“procedural issues,” including mediation, status conferences, and telephone conferences\n\nwith the client and opposing counsel. The court concluded it would “allow all time and\n\nfees requested by Mr. Picozzi, . . . since these things pertain to the entire case, and\n\nallocation is absolutely impossible.” The Hafens argue the court abused its discretion\n\nbecause “the billing statements for these procedural matters do not specify which issues\nwere addressed at any of these proceedings.” Picozzi, however, pared inapplicable time\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\ffrom his billing for each category and attested the remainder related to the Moshenko\n\nagreement or common issues.\n\n              For example, he did not seek fees for 4.8 hours he spent in mediation and\n\npreparation for the mediation on the prescriptive easement claim, nor 1.2 hours\n\nresearching issues related to the Meacher agreement, nor 2.1 hours related to a real estate\n\nagent’s alleged written disclosure of the Meacher agreement. He also explained Nielsen\n\nwas a busy attorney herself and that most of the time he spent on the phone with her over\n\nthe five years of litigation was devoted not to discussing particular legal issues, but rather\n\nto scheduling meetings, site visits, conferences, depositions, court dates, and other issues\n\ncommon to the entire case. Picozzi explained the same was true in his telephone\n\nconferences with opposing counsel. Picozzi nevertheless was able to specify that\n\napproximately five of the nearly 20 hours he spent on the phone with counsel and client\n\ndid not pertain to scheduling or issues otherwise common to the Moshenko agreement,\n\nand therefore he did not seek fees for them. We observe that 15 billable hours on the\n\ntelephone over five years of litigation does not seem incredible or inherently improbable.\n\n              “The testimony of a single witness, even if that witness is a party to the\n\ncase, may constitute substantial evidence,” and “a trial court’s credibility findings cannot\nbe reversed on appeal unless that testimony is incredible on its face or inherently\n\nimprobable.” (Consolidated Irrigation Dist. v. City of Selma (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th\n\n187, 201 (Consolidated); see, e.g., Diamond Woodworks, Inc. v. Argonaut Ins. Co. (2003)\n\n109 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1045 [where jury credited attorney’s testimony he apportioned\n\nfees and all were reasonable and necessary, “we do not reassess such matters”]; overruled\n\non another ground in Simon v. San Paolo U.S. Holding Co., Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1159,\n\n1182-1183.) Here, Picozzi’s declaration, billing statements, and explanation that he\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fpared some procedural fees and the rest were incurred on common issues all support the\n\ntrial court’s award.\n\n              In particular, the Hafens’ appellate challenge to the mediation fees\n\nillustrates the soundness of the trial court’s ruling. The Hafens complain that even after\n\nstriking out numerous hours related to the mediation, Picozzi still billed 10.2 hours for\n\nmediation-related time though “the entire mediation took only eight hours” and Picozzi\n\ndid not explicitly segregate time spent in the mediation on the Moshenko agreement or\n\ncommon issues.\n\n              But the Hafens ignore the requisite preparation and travel time for\n\nmediation and, as they acknowledged below, “[t]ime relating to mediation is spent in\n\nsettling the case, not litigating specific issues.” (Italics added.) The Hafens sought on\n\nthis ground to deny Nielsen any fees for mediation, but the trial court reasonably could\n\nconclude the mediation — like the telephone calls and status conferences — was a\n\nprocedural event that necessarily arose in litigating the claims the Hafens chose to assert,\n\nand therefore these procedural matters were common to all the claims. Put another way,\n\nPicozzi would have had to prepare for, travel to, and attend mediation even if the Hafens\n\nhad only asserted a claim based on the fee-bearing Moshenko agreement, and therefore\nthe scheduling and calls necessary to arrange these and other proceedings was common to\n\nall the claims. The trial court also reasonably could conclude it was purely speculative\n\nthe mediation would have taken substantially less time had it only involved the\n\nMoshenko agreement. The gravamen of the Hafens’ suit was to preserve their\n\nunobstructed hilltop views, an objective common to all their claims, and the trial court\n\ntherefore reasonably could conclude Nielsen was entitled to fees for time spent\n\nattempting to meet that objective in mediation. We discern no abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fC.     TRO and Preliminary Injunction Efforts\n\n               The Hafens contend the trial court erred in awarding Nielsen fees for 46.7\n\nhours of her attorney’s time preparing for and defending against their efforts to obtain a\n\ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The trial court inferred that\n\nbecause “this TRO was sought at the outset of the litigation, Plaintiffs would have used\n\nthe existence of both agreements to show the existence of an easement. This is\n\nsomething which does not appear easy to allocate.” To the contrary, according to the\n\nHafens, “the TRO and Preliminary Injunction motion dealt exclusively with the Meacher\n\nAgreement as it involved the exchange aspects of that agreement and Plaintiff’s right to\n\nuse the property subject to the Meacher Agreement and only the Meacher Agreement.”\n\nThey insist “it would have been a simple matter for Nielsen to attach a copy of the\n\nHafens’ motion for TRO/Preliminary Injunction to support her claim the motion was\n\nbased on ‘issues exclusive to either the fee allowing agreement or issues common to both\n\nagreements’ and that her attorney [properly] expended a whopping 46.7 hours defending\n\nthose ‘intertwined’ claims . . . .”\n\n               To illuminate and correct this asserted error, the Hafens request on appeal\n\nthat we take judicial notice of their TRO and preliminary injunction motion, which they\nomitted in the record on appeal because they did not provide it to the trial court as a basis\n\nto reject Nielsen’s fee request. We decline the request for judicial notice because it\n\nwould be inappropriate to receive new evidence on appeal to consider reversing the trial\n\ncourt based on evidence the Hafens omitted. Moreover, as noted, Picozzi’s declaration\n\nand billing statements averring the manner in which he spent his time constituted\n\nsubstantial evidence supporting the trial court’s award because it was for the trial court to\n\nevaluate his credibility. (Consolidated, supra, 204 Cal.App.4th at p. 201.) Because an\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fappellate court does not reweigh evidence in reviewing an attorney fee award (Weber v.\n\nLangholz (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1578, 1587), we cannot say the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in awarding fees for the TRO and injunction motion based on Picozzi’s\n\ndeclaration.\n\n               At oral argument on appeal, the Hafens insisted their TRO and injunction\n\nrequest was aimed predominantly at preserving the garden wall described in the Meacher\n\nagreement, and therefore did not implicate the Moshenko agreement, and the trial court\n\nshould not have awarded fees. But they acknowledge in their opening brief that the TRO\n\nand injunction motion “involved the exchange aspects” of the Meacher agreement, which\n\nin turn was premised on keeping intact the Moshenko agreement’s view and land\n\nexchange provisions. The trial court therefore reasonably could infer the purpose of the\n\ngarden wall was to safeguard these same view and land exchange interests.\n\n               Thus, the strong demarcation the Hafens now draw between the Meacher\n\nagreement and the Moshenko agreement is not as impervious as they insist. Both\n\nagreements pertained primarily to the view easements created on the two parcels, and the\n\nHafens themselves argued throughout the litigation that a prospective buyer considering\n\nthe property would not be surprised at the existence of a view easement. In particular,\nthey insisted circumstantial evidence common to both agreements put Nielsen on\n\n“inquiry notice” concerning a view easement. Under the Hafens’ theory of the case, a\n\nduty to inquire about a view easement arose in part from the proximity and layout of the\n\nparcels, the setting so suggestive of views as a priority, clues like the garden wall from\n\nwhich one might infer the mutual importance accorded the view, and the Hafens’\n\nassertedly prescriptive activities to maintain their view.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f              While this manner of viewing the evidence did not persuade the court at\n\ntrial that Nielsen actually received notice of either view agreement, the court in awarding\n\nfees reasonably could conclude Picozzi had to prepare to meet these arguments and that\n\nhe reasonably did so from the outset of the case in opposing the TRO and preliminary\n\ninjunction. In other words, the circumstantial evidence supporting the existence of a\n\nview easement, whether embodied in the Moshenko agreement or the Meacher\n\nagreement, was intertwined and common to both agreements. And the legal theory for\n\nenforcing both agreements — as an equitable servitude based on notice inherent in the\n\nproperty circumstances — was the same.\n\n              The Hafens also expressly alleged the Moshenko agreement as an\n\nalternative basis for their complaint. Given these circumstances, the trial court\n\nreasonably could infer on the record before it that the Moshenko agreement was\n\nimplicated in their TRO and injunction request to maintain the status quo on the property.\n\nThe trial court therefore reasonably could conclude “[t]his is something which does not\n\nappear easy to allocate” in awarding fees. In any event, as noted, the trial court’s\n\ncredibility determination on the parties’ competing declarations concerning the basis of\n\nthe TRO and injunction motion suffices by itself to support the court’s fee award.\n\nD.     Deposition Hours and Picozzi’s Credibility Generally\n\n              The Hafens argue that because the trial court labeled as a mere “guess”\n\nPicozzi’s estimate he spent 70 percent of his 58 hours in deposition time on the\n\nMoshenko agreement or overlapping issues, the court should have denied these attorney\n\nfees altogether instead of awarding Nielsen nearly half — 25 hours. More generally, the\n\nHafens argue the trial court should have taken a stricter view of Picozzi’s claims because\nit had not presided over the trial and because, for example, once Picozzi provided his\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fbilling statements, he revised his initial fee request downwards, suggesting he was not\n\ncredible in previously declaring his fee request reflected his best estimate of his\n\nallocation of time.\n\n              These matters, however, were entirely within the trial court’s purview to\n\ndecide. The Hafens point out the trial court is not bound to accept an attorney’s\n\nitemization of time spent in a billing affidavit (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d\n\n677, 682), and that the court may “exercise its discretion in assigning a reasonable\n\npercentage to the entries, or simply cast them aside” (Bell v. Vista Unified School Dist.\n\n(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 672, 689). But these very quotations confirm the trial court’s\n\ndiscretion to weigh the evidence before it, including an attorney’s declarations and billing\n\nstatements. These credibility determinations are for the trial court to decide and furnish\n\nno grounds for reversal.

The Hafens\n\ncontend the trial court abused its discretion by awarding Nielsen $65,898 of the $179,000\n\nin fees she requested. Specifically, the Hafens argue the trial court abused its discretion\n\nin apportioning Nielsen’s fees between her defense involving a fee-bearing agreement\n\nthat the Hafens alleged created an equitable servitude on her property and her defense\n\nagainst the Hafens’ claims involving prescription and an alleged equitable servitude\n\narising from an agreement without a fee provision. In essence, the Hafens challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court’s order, and they attack in particular\n\nthe credibility of Nielsen’s attorney, Edward M. Picozzi, in attesting to his fee allocations\n\nfor the work he performed. We affirm the order.\n\n                                              I\n\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n              This action concerns adjoining, hilltop parcels in Trabuco Canyon,\n\nCalifornia. The Hafens own a single-family residence with panoramic views in all\n\ndirections on one parcel, located at 30021 Canyon Creek Drive (30021). The best views\n\nfrom that residence are to the west across the undeveloped, adjacent parcel located at\n30022 Canyon Creek Drive (30022). The only flat area readily suitable for building a\n\nhome on 30022 is the portion nearest 30021. Development on this flat area would\n\nsignificantly impact the view west from the Hafens’ home on 30021.\n\n              Nielsen purchased 30022 in May 2005 from Michael Meacher. The next\n\nmonth, in June 2005, Meacher faxed Nielsen a copy of a purported January 2005\n\nagreement he entered with the Hafens (the Meacher agreement), calling for an exchange\n\nof the flat area on 30022 for an unspecified portion of the Hafens’ property. The\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fMeacher agreement also referenced a 2001 agreement (the Moshenko agreement)\n\nbetween former owners of 30021 and 30022 that similarly called for a land-exchange\n\nbetween the two parcels to “keep” the views from each “unobstructed.” The Moshenko\n\nagreement included an attorney fee provision; the Meacher agreement did not.\n\n              Nielsen refused to be bound by either agreement because the land exchange\n\nwould preclude building a residence on her property and she knew nothing of the\n\nagreements before her purchase. The Hafens sued Nielsen in June 2005.\n\n              The operative second amended complaint alleged five causes of action\n\nagainst Nielsen on the theory both the Meacher agreement and Moshenko agreement\n\nwere enforceable against her as equitable servitudes.1 The first and second causes of\n\naction sought specific performance and declaratory relief regarding the land exchange\n\nand view easements described in the Meacher agreement. The third cause of action\n\nalleged the Hafens acquired a prescriptive easement for the nonexclusive use of 30022’s\n\nflat area because the Hafens and their predecessors continually used the area for\n\napproximately 20 years. If the Meacher agreement’s land exchange and view easements\n\ncould not be enforced for any reason, the fourth and fifth causes of action sought specific\n\nperformance and declaratory relief regarding the Moshenko agreements’ view easements.\n\n\n\n\n       1       “An equitable servitude is a restriction on the use of real property that is\nenforceable even though not imposed as a covenant in the manner provided by law. The\ndoctrine of equitable servitudes arose as a means of giving effect to restrictions that did\nnot meet the stringent legal standards required for covenants running with the land.”\n(8 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate (3d ed. 2009) § 24:1 at p. 24–4.) When a covenant\ndoes not run with the land, it nonetheless may be enforced against a subsequent owner as\nan equitable servitude if (1) the subsequent owner took title with knowledge of the\ncovenant’s terms, and (2) it would be inequitable to permit the subsequent owner to avoid\nthe restrictions the covenant imposed.

In its statement of decision, the trial court found Nielsen\n\nhad no actual or imputed knowledge of the Meacher agreement and the evidence did not\n\ncreate a duty for her to investigate the existence of an agreement regarding view\n\neasements or a land exchange. The trial court also found that (1) the Meacher agreement\n\ncould not be enforced as a covenant running with the land because the parties failed to\n\nrecord it and (2) the Moshenko agreement could not be enforced because the Meacher\n\nagreement rescinded it. The trial court made no express ruling in its statement of\n\ndecision on the Hafens’ prescriptive easement cause of action.\n\n              The Hafens appealed, omitting any challenge regarding their prescriptive\n\neasement claim, and we affirmed the judgment in an unpublished opinion. (Hafen v.\n\nNielsen (G043337, June 30, 2011) [nonpub. opn.] (Hafen I).)\n\n              Based on the Moshenko agreement attorney fees provision, Nielsen filed a\n\nmotion to recover the attorney fees she incurred defending the Hafens’ claims. The trial\n\ncourt granted the motion, but awarded just $1,050 of the $179,900 Nielsen sought,\n\napportioning three hours of attorney time billed at Nielsen’s lawyer’s $350 hourly rate.\nThe court’s minute order explained, “The only basis for recovery of attorney fees is\n\ncontained in the 2001 Moshenko agreement. That agreement had been expressly\n\nrescinded and never was recorded so could not be enforced against [Nielsen]. The fees\n\nattributable to that agreement must be apportioned.”\n\n              When Nielsen appealed, we affirmed the necessity of apportioning her\n\nattorney fees to (1) issues relating exclusively to the Moshenko agreement or (2) issues\n\ncommon to the Moshenko agreement and the Meacher agreement or the prescriptive\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\feasement claim. (Hafen v. Nielsen (G044204, Nov. 28, 2011) [nonpub. opn.], p. 13\n\n(Hafen II).) We reversed the trial court’s apportionment of just $1,050 to these matters\n\nbecause the court mistakenly concluded the absence of a formal covenant running with\n\nthe land virtually eliminated attorney fees.\n\n              The trial court had reasoned, “‘This issue [] I think could have been done in\n\na half hour. [¶] . . . [¶] As soon as someone told me, hey, there’s a statute that says\n\ncovenants running with the land have to be recorded, that’s the end of [that aspect of] the\n\ncase. [¶] . . . [¶] The amount of time you would have to address [the Moshenko\n\nagreement claims] compared to the rest of the case is almost zero. It’s very minimal.\n\nThat cause of action would have been out in a minute.’” (Hafen II, supra, at p. 11.) We\n\nexplained, however, that an agreement running with the land, although unrecorded, may\n\nnevertheless be enforced as an equitable servitude, provided the subsequent owner took\n\ntitle with knowledge of the covenant’s terms and it would be inequitable to permit the\n\nsubsequent owner to avoid the covenant’s restrictions. (Id. at p. 12; see fn. 1 ante.)\n\n              On remand to reapportion the fees, the former trial judge had retired,\n\nleaving the new judge in, as he noted, “the unenviable position of ruling on a motion for\n\nattorney fees on a case in which it was never involved pre-judgment.” The parties\nsubmitted their briefing and declarations concerning fees, but the trial court had to\n\ncontinue the hearing because Nielsen’s attorney, Edward Picozzi, forgot to attach his\n\nbilling statements. After the parties submitted supplemental declarations and briefing,\n\nincluding Picozzi’s billing statements, the trial court concluded in its tentative decision\n\nthat Nielsen was entitled to approximately $66,000 of her nearly $180,000 in claimed\n\nfees, but the tentative awarded no fees for time spent in trial because Picozzi “provide[d]\n\nabsolutely no hours [apportioning his trial time] despite a second chance to do so via the\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fSupplemental Declaration.” At the hearing, the trial court granted Picozzi’s request to\n\nfile a further declaration, which he did, and the parties again briefed the issue, and the\n\ntrial court re-heard the matter, taking it under submission.\n\n              The trial court issued a very detailed order denying Nielsen her fees during\n\ntrial, but awarding nearly $66,000 in pretrial fees supported by Picozzi’s billing statement\n\nand declarations.2 The court’s order explained: “The Court finds a total of 188.28 hours\n\nwere spent on issues relating exclusively to the 2001 [Moshenko] Agreement and issues\n\ncommon to the 2001 [Moshenko] Agreement and either the 2005 [Meacher] Agreement\n\nor the prescriptive easement claim. The court also finds Mr. Picozzi’s hourly rate of\n\n$350 an hour over the course of five years to be very reasonable. Therefore, the total\n\namount of fees allowed is $65,898.00.”\n\n              The trial court meticulously specified the allocations for which it allowed\n\nand disallowed fees. For example, “[a]s to procedural issues such as Mediation[,] Status\n\nConferences, CMCs, Telephone Conferences with Client, Telephone Conferences with\n\nCounsel: The Court will allow all time and fees requested by Mr. Picozzi, . . . since these\n\nthings pertain to the entire case, and allocation is absolutely impossible. [¶] Mediation:\n\n10.2 [hours] [¶] Status Conferences, MSC: 58.20+6.5 = 65.70 [¶] Telephone\nConferences w/ client: 14.95 [¶] Telephone Conferences w/ Counsel: 14.85.”\n\n(Original underlining.)\n\n              The other categories in which the court allowed fees consisted of: “As to\n\nthe Plaintiff’s Ex Parte TRO and Preliminary Injunction Efforts: The Court will also\n\nallow the 46.7 hours as sought by Mr. Picozzi. If this TRO was sought at the outset of\n\nthe litigation, Plaintiffs would have used the existence of both agreements to show the\n\n       2      The trial court also awarded Nielsen $19,250 in fees for her appeal in\nHafen II, and the Hafens do not challenge that fee award.\n\n                                              6\n\fexistence of an easement. This is something which does not appear easy to allocate. [¶]\n\n. . . [¶] Time for Site Inspection in the amount of 10.88 hours is allowed as viewing the\n\nland would go to all causes of action. . . . [¶] As to Depositions, Mr. Picozzi suggests\n\n58 hours were spent. He essentially guesses at how much time is spent on the fee-\n\nallowing agreement and cross-over issues. He suggests 70 percent, but this is a guess.\n\nBecause Mr. Picozzi does not give a number of specific hours, the Court will allow\n\n25 hours time — which represents about half of the time sought.” (Original underlining.)\n\n                The trial court rejected Nielsen’s fee request in the following categories:\n\n“As to Legal research, it is difficult to see how very many issues would overlap. It\n\nshould not have taken 14.6 hours to discover the 2001 [Moshenko] Agreement (which\n\nallowed for fees) was essentially rescinded by virtue of the 2005 [Meacher] Agreement\n\nbeing signed. As research has not been broken down specifically to 2001 [Moshenko]\n\nAgreement and overlap, the Court will deny the request for 14.6 hours. [¶] . . . [¶] As for\n\ntime spent for trial, Mr. Picozzi provides absolutely no meaningful evidentiary support\n\nfor fees for time spent in trial, despite various opportunities to do so via Supplemental\n\nDeclarations. Mr. Picozzi does not support his claim for apportionment with anything\n\nother than his own recollection and figures. There is no real reference to billing\nstatements, court transcript[s], etc. Therefore, fees for trial are not allowed.” (Original\n\nunderlining.)\n\n                Concluding its order, the trial court explained: “Adding up all the hours,\n\nthe Court arrives at the sum of 188.28 total hours spent on fee-allowing agreement and\n\ncross-over issues which are so inextricably linked that allocation is impossible.” The\n\ntrial court awarded Nielsen attorney fees at $350 an hour multiplied by 188.28 hours for a\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\ftotal of $65,898, and the Hafens now appeal. Nielsen does not appeal the hours\n\ndisallowed.\n\n                                              II\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Standard of Review\n\n              As we noted in Hafen II, the standard of review is well-established.\n\n“‘California courts have long held that trial courts have broad discretion in determining\n\nthe amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award. This determination is necessarily ad\n\nhoc and must be resolved on the particular circumstances of each case.’ [Citation.] In\n\nexercising its discretion, the trial court may accordingly ‘consider all of the facts and the\n\nentire procedural history of the case in setting the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee\n\naward.’ [Citation.]” (Bernardi v.

The Hafens challenge the number of hours the\n\ntrial court awarded in every category it identified, and we examine each of these\n\nchallenges in turn.\n\nB.      Procedural Issues\n              The Hafens challenge the hours the trial court grouped together as\n\n“procedural issues,” including mediation, status conferences, and telephone conferences\n\nwith the client and opposing counsel. The court concluded it would “allow all time and\n\nfees requested by Mr. Picozzi, . . . since these things pertain to the entire case, and\n\nallocation is absolutely impossible.” The Hafens argue the court abused its discretion\n\nbecause “the billing statements for these procedural matters do not specify which issues\nwere addressed at any of these proceedings.” Picozzi, however, pared inapplicable time\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\ffrom his billing for each category and attested the remainder related to the Moshenko\n\nagreement or common issues.\n\n              For example, he did not seek fees for 4.8 hours he spent in mediation and\n\npreparation for the mediation on the prescriptive easement claim, nor 1.2 hours\n\nresearching issues related to the Meacher agreement, nor 2.1 hours related to a real estate\n\nagent’s alleged written disclosure of the Meacher agreement. He also explained Nielsen\n\nwas a busy attorney herself and that most of the time he spent on the phone with her over\n\nthe five years of litigation was devoted not to discussing particular legal issues, but rather\n\nto scheduling meetings, site visits, conferences, depositions, court dates, and other issues\n\ncommon to the entire case. Picozzi explained the same was true in his telephone\n\nconferences with opposing counsel. Picozzi nevertheless was able to specify that\n\napproximately five of the nearly 20 hours he spent on the phone with counsel and client\n\ndid not pertain to scheduling or issues otherwise common to the Moshenko agreement,\n\nand therefore he did not seek fees for them. We observe that 15 billable hours on the\n\ntelephone over five years of litigation does not seem incredible or inherently improbable.\n\n              “The testimony of a single witness, even if that witness is a party to the\n\ncase, may constitute substantial evidence,” and “a trial court’s credibility findings cannot\nbe reversed on appeal unless that testimony is incredible on its face or inherently\n\nimprobable.” (Consolidated Irrigation Dist. v.

Here, Picozzi’s declaration, billing statements, and explanation that he\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fpared some procedural fees and the rest were incurred on common issues all support the\n\ntrial court’s award.\n\n              In particular, the Hafens’ appellate challenge to the mediation fees\n\nillustrates the soundness of the trial court’s ruling. The Hafens complain that even after\n\nstriking out numerous hours related to the mediation, Picozzi still billed 10.2 hours for\n\nmediation-related time though “the entire mediation took only eight hours” and Picozzi\n\ndid not explicitly segregate time spent in the mediation on the Moshenko agreement or\n\ncommon issues.\n\n              But the Hafens ignore the requisite preparation and travel time for\n\nmediation and, as they acknowledged below, “[t]ime relating to mediation is spent in\n\nsettling the case, not litigating specific issues.” (Italics added.) The Hafens sought on\n\nthis ground to deny Nielsen any fees for mediation, but the trial court reasonably could\n\nconclude the mediation — like the telephone calls and status conferences — was a\n\nprocedural event that necessarily arose in litigating the claims the Hafens chose to assert,\n\nand therefore these procedural matters were common to all the claims. Put another way,\n\nPicozzi would have had to prepare for, travel to, and attend mediation even if the Hafens\n\nhad only asserted a claim based on the fee-bearing Moshenko agreement, and therefore\nthe scheduling and calls necessary to arrange these and other proceedings was common to\n\nall the claims. The trial court also reasonably could conclude it was purely speculative\n\nthe mediation would have taken substantially less time had it only involved the\n\nMoshenko agreement. The gravamen of the Hafens’ suit was to preserve their\n\nunobstructed hilltop views, an objective common to all their claims, and the trial court\n\ntherefore reasonably could conclude Nielsen was entitled to fees for time spent\n\nattempting to meet that objective in mediation. We discern no abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fC.     TRO and Preliminary Injunction Efforts\n\n               The Hafens contend the trial court erred in awarding Nielsen fees for 46.7\n\nhours of her attorney’s time preparing for and defending against their efforts to obtain a\n\ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The trial court inferred that\n\nbecause “this TRO was sought at the outset of the litigation, Plaintiffs would have used\n\nthe existence of both agreements to show the existence of an easement. This is\n\nsomething which does not appear easy to allocate.” To the contrary, according to the\n\nHafens, “the TRO and Preliminary Injunction motion dealt exclusively with the Meacher\n\nAgreement as it involved the exchange aspects of that agreement and Plaintiff’s right to\n\nuse the property subject to the Meacher Agreement and only the Meacher Agreement.”\n\nThey insist “it would have been a simple matter for Nielsen to attach a copy of the\n\nHafens’ motion for TRO/Preliminary Injunction to support her claim the motion was\n\nbased on ‘issues exclusive to either the fee allowing agreement or issues common to both\n\nagreements’ and that her attorney [properly] expended a whopping 46.7 hours defending\n\nthose ‘intertwined’ claims . . . .”\n\n               To illuminate and correct this asserted error, the Hafens request on appeal\n\nthat we take judicial notice of their TRO and preliminary injunction motion, which they\nomitted in the record on appeal because they did not provide it to the trial court as a basis\n\nto reject Nielsen’s fee request. We decline the request for judicial notice because it\n\nwould be inappropriate to receive new evidence on appeal to consider reversing the trial\n\ncourt based on evidence the Hafens omitted. Moreover, as noted, Picozzi’s declaration\n\nand billing statements averring the manner in which he spent his time constituted\n\nsubstantial evidence supporting the trial court’s award because it was for the trial court to\n\nevaluate his credibility. (Consolidated, supra, 204 Cal.App.4th at p. 201.) Because an\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fappellate court does not reweigh evidence in reviewing an attorney fee award (Weber v.\n\nLangholz (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2283038\"><a href=\"/opinion/2283038/weber-v-langholz/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1578</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1587), we cannot say the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in awarding fees for the TRO and injunction motion based on Picozzi’s\n\ndeclaration.\n\n               At oral argument on appeal, the Hafens insisted their TRO and injunction\n\nrequest was aimed predominantly at preserving the garden wall described in the Meacher\n\nagreement, and therefore did not implicate the Moshenko agreement, and the trial court\n\nshould not have awarded fees. But they acknowledge in their opening brief that the TRO\n\nand injunction motion “involved the exchange aspects” of the Meacher agreement, which\n\nin turn was premised on keeping intact the Moshenko agreement’s view and land\n\nexchange provisions. The trial court therefore reasonably could infer the purpose of the\n\ngarden wall was to safeguard these same view and land exchange interests.\n\n               Thus, the strong demarcation the Hafens now draw between the Meacher\n\nagreement and the Moshenko agreement is not as impervious as they insist. Both\n\nagreements pertained primarily to the view easements created on the two parcels, and the\n\nHafens themselves argued throughout the litigation that a prospective buyer considering\n\nthe property would not be surprised at the existence of a view easement. In particular,\nthey insisted circumstantial evidence common to both agreements put Nielsen on\n\n“inquiry notice” concerning a view easement. Under the Hafens’ theory of the case, a\n\nduty to inquire about a view easement arose in part from the proximity and layout of the\n\nparcels, the setting so suggestive of views as a priority, clues like the garden wall from\n\nwhich one might infer the mutual importance accorded the view, and the Hafens’\n\nassertedly prescriptive activities to maintain their view.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f              While this manner of viewing the evidence did not persuade the court at\n\ntrial that Nielsen actually received notice of either view agreement, the court in awarding\n\nfees reasonably could conclude Picozzi had to prepare to meet these arguments and that\n\nhe reasonably did so from the outset of the case in opposing the TRO and preliminary\n\ninjunction. In other words, the circumstantial evidence supporting the existence of a\n\nview easement, whether embodied in the Moshenko agreement or the Meacher\n\nagreement, was intertwined and common to both agreements. And the legal theory for\n\nenforcing both agreements — as an equitable servitude based on notice inherent in the\n\nproperty circumstances — was the same.\n\n              The Hafens also expressly alleged the Moshenko agreement as an\n\nalternative basis for their complaint. Given these circumstances, the trial court\n\nreasonably could infer on the record before it that the Moshenko agreement was\n\nimplicated in their TRO and injunction request to maintain the status quo on the property.\n\nThe trial court therefore reasonably could conclude “[t]his is something which does not\n\nappear easy to allocate” in awarding fees. In any event, as noted, the trial court’s\n\ncredibility determination on the parties’ competing declarations concerning the basis of\n\nthe TRO and injunction motion suffices by itself to support the court’s fee award.\n\nD.     Deposition Hours and Picozzi’s Credibility Generally\n\n              The Hafens argue that because the trial court labeled as a mere “guess”\n\nPicozzi’s estimate he spent 70 percent of his 58 hours in deposition time on the\n\nMoshenko agreement or overlapping issues, the court should have denied these attorney\n\nfees altogether instead of awarding Nielsen nearly half — 25 hours. More generally, the\n\nHafens argue the trial court should have taken a stricter view of Picozzi’s claims because\nit had not presided over the trial and because, for example, once Picozzi provided his\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fbilling statements, he revised his initial fee request downwards, suggesting he was not\n\ncredible in previously declaring his fee request reflected his best estimate of his\n\nallocation of time.\n\n              These matters, however, were entirely within the trial court’s purview to\n\ndecide. The Hafens point out the trial court is not bound to accept an attorney’s\n\nitemization of time spent in a billing affidavit (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2133277\"><a href=\"/opinion/2133277/hadley-v-krepel/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 682), and that the court may “exercise its discretion in assigning a reasonable\n\npercentage to the entries, or simply cast them aside” (Bell v. Vista Unified School Dist.\n\n(2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2267912\"><a href=\"/opinion/2267912/bell-v-vista-unified-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 689). But these very quotations confirm the trial court’s\n\ndiscretion to weigh the evidence before it, including an attorney’s declarations and billing\n\nstatements. These credibility determinations are for the trial court to decide and furnish\n\nno grounds for reversal.
