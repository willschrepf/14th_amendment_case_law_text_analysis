We vacate\n\nthe   district      court’s     summary        judgment        order     granting         the\n\ndefendants     qualified      immunity     on        the    plaintiff’s       claims       for\n\nmonetary relief.        We also vacate the district court’s decision\n\nthat the prison’s abandonment of the policy mooted the claims\n\nfor equitable relief.          We remand to the district court for such\n\nfurther proceedings as may be appropriate.\n\n\n\n                                         I.\n\n      The plaintiff, Gary Wall, is a state prisoner housed at Red\n\nOnion State Prison (“ROSP”) in Pound, Virginia.                        As a member of\n\nthe   Nation   of    Islam,    in   2008       and    2009    Wall     was    allowed       to\n\nobserve the holy month of Ramadan while in state custody.                                   To\n\naccommodate       Ramadan     observance,            prison      officials             provide\n\nparticipating inmates with special meals served before sunrise\n\nand after sunset.           While at ROSP, Wall also received “common\n\nfare” meals, which satisfied his religious beliefs.\n\n      Prior to 2010, Muslim inmates at ROSP simply had to sign up\n\nto participate in Ramadan.            In 2009, approximately half of the\n\n                                           3\n\finmate population signed up.                  ROSP staff later determined that a\n\nsignificant number of the participating inmates were not, in\n\nfact,      practicing      Muslims.           As       a    result,         ROSP    devised     a   new\n\neligibility policy for 2010:                  in addition to signing up, inmates\n\nhad to provide some physical indicia of Islamic faith, such as a\n\nQuran, Kufi, prayer rug, or written religious material obtained\n\nfrom the prison Chaplain’s office. 1                             ROSP inmates who did not\n\nhave       such    materials      or    refused            to    acquire      them       were   deemed\n\ninsincere in their religious beliefs and were prohibited from\n\nparticipating in Ramadan. 2\n\n       Wall       was   one     of     the    inmates            who    was        not   allowed     to\n\nparticipate.            After    initially         signing            up,    Wall    was    asked    by\n\ndefendants James Wade, C. Selyers, and J. Stallard to provide\n\nphysical evidence of the sincerity of his beliefs in accordance\n\nwith       the    new   policy.        Wall    stated            that       all    his   belongings,\n\nincluding         his   articles       of     faith,            had    been       lost   during     his\n\n\n\n       1\n       This policy was somewhat unique among Virginia Department\nof Corrections (“VDOC”) facilities.     Most prisons maintain a\n“religious pass list,” which keeps track of which inmates\nparticipate in specific religious services.     However, because\nmost ROSP inmates are in long-term administrative segregation,\nROSP does not offer group religious services.       Consequently,\nROSP does not keep a religious pass list.\n       2\n       In 2010, with the new policy in place, only 176 of the 360\ninmates who signed up to participate provided the necessary\nmaterials. The other 187 inmates were prohibited from observing\nthe fasting hours.\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\ftransfer to ROSP.          He showed Wade a state court judgment against\n\nthe Commonwealth as proof that VDOC had lost his possessions. 3\n\nWall       also    produced      documents    showing   that    he   was   receiving\n\ncommon fare meals in accordance with his faith, and he informed\n\nthe officers that he had observed Ramadan in 2008 and 2009.\n\nDespite this, Wade responded, “that don’t mean anything,” and\n\ninstructed Stallard and Selyers to remove Wall from the Ramadan\n\nlist.       J.A. 139.\n\n       Wall       then   filed    an    informal   complaint,    again     explaining\n\nthat his religious materials had been lost and requesting to be\n\nallowed to participate.                In a memo in response to the complaint,\n\nWade reiterated ROSP’s new policy, stating:\n\n       [ROSP] does not have religious services so the\n       following rules apply to this institution.      You are\n       required to have religious material such as ([ku]f\n       [i], [Qu]r[a]n, prayer rug or religious pamphlets that\n       pertain to the Ramadan month long fasting.)        Food\n       service went to every inmate[’]s cell to inspect the\n       above religious material. Either you had no religious\n       material or refused to present material[.]    [T]his is\n       why you were removed from the Ramadan pass list.\n\nJ.A. 42.\n\n       On August 11, 2010, the first morning of Ramadan, Wall did\n\nnot eat breakfast and concealed a portion of his meal in his\n\n       3\n       Although the judgment itself does not reference the nature\nof Wall’s underlying claim, he later received a letter from the\nVirginia Attorney General’s office explaining that it was in\nresponse to “founded grievances regarding . . . lost property\n. . . .” J.A. 126.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fcell to save until after sunset.               ROSP staff found the food and\n\nthreatened to charge him with possessing contraband.                         Faced with\n\nchoosing between starvation and sanctions, Wall ate during the\n\nday and violated his religious beliefs.\n\n       On August 15, Wall filed a formal grievance, which was also\n\ndenied.      Six days later, he had a conversation with Wade and\n\nAssistant Warden Robert Rowlette, in which Rowlette asked if he\n\nwould like to be put back on the Ramadan list provided it could\n\nbe verified that he had truly lost his belongings.                         According to\n\nWall, he responded that he still wanted to participate, but that\n\nhe also wanted an explanation for why he was taken off the list\n\nin the first place.          Rowlette replied, “[o]kay,” and then walked\n\naway while Wall shouted “I want to participate in Ramadan!                               I\n\nwant    my   Ramadan,       Rowlette!”        J.A.    140.         According      to   the\n\ndefendants, however, Wall refused Rowlette’s offer to be put\n\nback on the list, saying, “[n]o, I’m going to pursue this in\n\ncourt.”         J.A.   93.      Ultimately,          Wall    was     not    allowed    to\n\nparticipate in Ramadan in 2010.\n\n       Having     exhausted    his    administrative         remedies,      Wall   filed\n\nsuit under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons\n\nAct    (“RLUIPA”),     42    U.S.C.    § 2000cc,       et    seq.,    and    42    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983.      In an amended complaint, Wall alleged violations of\n\nRLUIPA and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, in\n\naddition     to   several     related    state       law    claims.        The    amended\n\n                                          6\n\fcomplaint        sought      “[a]     declaratory        judgment,      nominal       damages,\n\nunspecified joint and several compensatory damages, $10,000 in\n\npunitive damages from each defendant, and any additional relief\n\nthis court deems just, proper, and equitable.”                          J.A. 32-33.\n\n       Shortly after the suit was filed, Wall was transferred out\n\nof     ROSP     to    a     lower-security         facility.           Subsequently,         the\n\ndistrict        court       granted      the   defendants’         motion      for        summary\n\njudgment, finding that any claims for equitable relief were moot\n\nfollowing Wall’s transfer, and ruling that the defendants were\n\nentitled        to   qualified      immunity       on    the     plaintiff’s        claim    for\n\ndamages.\n\n       Following the district court’s ruling, Wall was transferred\n\nback       to   ROSP.        The    defendants          claim    that     ROSP      has    since\n\nabandoned its policy of requiring prisoners to possess physical\n\nindicia of faith in order to participate in Ramadan or other\n\nreligious observations.                  The new policy, adopted in a September\n\n13, 2011 memo by VDOC’s Chief of Corrections Operations, 4 states\n\nthat       inmates     in    segregation       facilities,         such       as    ROSP,    may\n\ndemonstrate          sincerity      by    showing    that       they   have    in    the    past\n\nborrowed religious material such as DVDs, CDs, or literature\n\n       4\n       The memo was not submitted as evidence in this case and is\ntherefore not part of the record, but it was referenced in a\nrelated case involving the same policy.     DePaola v. Wade, No.\n7:11-cv-00198, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44340, *7-10 (W.D. Va. Mar.\n30, 2012).\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\ffrom the Chaplain’s office.                The memo states that the change was\n\nmade       following      an   investigation       by    VDOC’s       Inspector    General,\n\nwhich concluded that “it is not appropriate to require inmates\n\nto buy something which is related to exercising First Amendment\n\n[r]ights.”          Following the policy change, Wall and other inmates\n\nwho were prohibited from observing Ramadan in 2010 were allowed\n\nto participate in a “make-up” Ramadan in April 2012.\n\n\n\n                                             II.\n\n       We review two issues in this appeal:                       whether the district\n\ncourt correctly determined that Wall’s equitable claims under\n\nRLUIPA       and    the    First     Amendment      were       moot    following       ROSP’s\n\ndecision to abandon the 2010 Ramadan policy; and whether the\n\ndistrict       court       correctly       granted       the    defendants        qualified\n\nimmunity on Wall’s First Amendment claim for damages. 5                                  Both\n\nissues are questions of law which we review de novo.                              See Green\n\nv.     City    of     Raleigh,       523    F.3d     293,      298     (4th     Cir.     2008)\n\n(mootness);         Johnson     v.   Caudill,      475   F.3d     645,    650     (4th    Cir.\n\n2007) (qualified immunity).                We address the issues in turn.\n\n       5\n       We note at the forefront that Congress did not authorize\ndamages claims against state officials under RLUIPA.         See\nSossamon v. Texas, 131 S. Ct. 1651, 1658-59 (2011) (prohibiting\ndamages claims against state officials in their official\ncapacity); Rendleman v. Rouse, 569 F.3d 182, 189 (4th Cir. 2009)\n(same for individual capacity). Therefore, the plaintiff’s only\npotential remedies under RLUIPA are equitable.\n\n\n                                              8\n\f                                                 A.\n\n       In granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment,\n\nthe    district         court     found        that    Wall’s    transfer      to   another\n\nfacility mooted              his request for equitable relief. 6                    Although\n\nWall’s      subsequent         return     to    ROSP     rendered     this   justification\n\nobsolete, the district court also ruled that in such an event\n\nWall’s claims would remain moot in light of VDOC’s decision to\n\nterminate the 2010 Ramadan policy.\n\n       It    is    well        established        that      a   defendant’s     “voluntary\n\ncessation     of        a    challenged     practice”       moots     an   action   only   if\n\n“subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly\n\nwrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”\n\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528\n\nU.S.   167,       189       (2000);   see      Knox    v.   Service    Employees     Intern.\n\n\n       6\n       As an initial matter, the defendants argue that, to the\nextent Wall has a justiciable claim for equitable relief, his\namended complaint failed to request injunctive relief in\nparticular.   While it is true that his original complaint was\nmore specific than the amended complaint, we are comfortable\nreading Wall’s prayer for any relief deemed “just, proper, and\nequitable” as encompassing a claim for injunctive relief.     An\nappropriately liberal reading of the amended complaint indicates\nthat Wall sought to prevent the defendants from wrongfully\nlimiting his observance of Ramadan in the future through the\nissuance of an injunction.    See De’lonta v. Johnson, 708 F.3d\n520, 524 (4th Cir. 2013) (“[Courts must] afford liberal\nconstruction to the allegations in pro se complaints raising\ncivil rights issues.”).   We also note that the district court,\nwhile not explicitly ruling on the issue, referred to Wall’s\nclaim as a request for “injunctive relief.” J.A. 142.\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fUnion, Local 1000, 132 S. Ct. 2277, 2287 (2012) (“The voluntary\n\ncessation of challenged conduct does not ordinarily render a\n\ncase    moot    because     a    dismissal         for   mootness     would      permit    a\n\nresumption of the challenged conduct as soon as the case is\n\ndismissed.”).          Were it otherwise, “courts would be compelled to\n\nleave ‘[t]he defendant . . . free to return to his old ways.’”\n\nCity of Mesquite v.

Concentrated Phosphate\n\nExport Ass’n, 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968)).\n\n       We have no difficulty concluding that the defendants failed\n\nto     meet    their    “heavy        burden”      of    establishing      that    it     is\n\n“absolutely       clear”        the    2010     Ramadan      policy       will    not     be\n\nreinstated.       Id.     Unsubstantiated assurances in their appellate\n\nbrief aside, the defendants have failed to put forth even a\n\nsingle    piece    of     evidence       establishing       that    the    practice       of\n\nrequiring physical indicia of faith has been terminated once and\n\nfor all.        The September 13, 2011 memorandum describing VDOC’s\n\npurported change in policy –- which was only submitted in a\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fdifferent case 7 –- also fails to establish that VDOC will not\n\nreinstate the policy following completion of this lawsuit.                              We\n\nhave previously held that when a defendant retains the authority\n\nand capacity to repeat an alleged harm, a plaintiff’s claims\n\nshould not be dismissed as moot.                    Town of Nags Head v. Toloczko,\n\n728 F.3d 391, 395 n.3 (4th Cir. 2013); Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d\n\n307, 316 (4th Cir. 2013); Lyons P’ship, L.P. v. Morris Costumes,\n\nInc., 243 F.3d 789, 800 (4th Cir. 2001).                            Nothing in the memo\n\nsuggests     that       VDOC    is     actually      barred    –-    or    even   considers\n\nitself barred -- from reinstating the 2010 Ramadan policy should\n\nit so choose.            To the contrary, the fact that at least three\n\nseparate      policies         have     been     utilized      at     ROSP    since   2009\n\nindicates some degree of doubt that the new policy will remain\n\nin place for long.\n\n      The defendants invite us to adopt an approach employed by\n\nseveral of our sister circuits, in which governmental defendants\n\nare   held    to    a    less     demanding         burden    of    proof    than   private\n\ndefendants.        See, e.g., Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. Bureau of\n\nReclamation, 601 F.3d 1096, 1116 (10th Cir. 2010) (“In practice\n\n. . . ,      Laidlaw’s         heavy    burden      frequently       has    not   prevented\n\ngovernmental officials from discontinuing challenged practices\n\n      7\n       While we are confident in our authority to take judicial\nnotice of the memorandum, we note that litigants do themselves\nno favor in relying on our willingness to do so.\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\fand mooting a case.”); Sossamon v. Texas, 560 F.3d 316, 325 (5th\n\nCir.       2009)   (“[C]ourts   are   justified    in    treating     a   voluntary\n\ngovernmental cessation of possibly wrongful conduct with some\n\nsolicitude,        mooting   cases    that    might     have   been   allowed   to\n\nproceed had the defendant not been a public entity.”).                    However,\n\neven if we were to adopt this approach, a question which we\n\nexpressly do not decide, we would have no trouble determining\n\nthat the defendants’ near total failure to provide the Court\n\nwith information regarding the change would remain insufficient\n\neven under a lesser standard.                In short, bald assertions of a\n\ndefendant –- whether governmental or private –- that it will not\n\nresume a challenged policy fail to satisfy any burden of showing\n\nthat a claim is moot. 8         We therefore vacate the district court’s\n\ndismissal of the plaintiff’s equitable claims.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n       Nor do we find any merit in the defendants’ contention\nthat the voluntary cessation doctrine does not apply in this\ncase because the change in policy was unrelated to the\nlitigation.    See ACLU of Mass. v. U.S. Conf. of Catholic\nBishops, 705 F.3d 44, 55 (1st Cir. 2013) (“[T]he voluntary\ncessation doctrine does not apply when the voluntary cessation\nof the challenged activity occurs because of reasons unrelated\nto the litigation.”) (quoting M. Redish, Moore’s Federal\nPractice, § 101.99[2]). It is undisputed that the September 13,\n2011 memo was issued after the plaintiff’s original complaint\nwas filed; and, as noted above, the change was made in the midst\nof a separate lawsuit filed by another ROSP inmate challenging\nthe same policy. The timing strongly indicates that the change\nwas at least somewhat related to the two pending lawsuits.\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f                                         B.\n\n      Turning to the plaintiff’s claim for monetary damages under\n\nthe     First   Amendment,       the    district     court     ruled     that     the\n\ndefendants      were   entitled    to    qualified       immunity. 9     Qualified\n\nimmunity protects government officials performing discretionary\n\nfunctions unless:        “(1) the allegations underlying the claim, if\n\ntrue,     substantiate    the    violation      of   a   federal      statutory    or\n\nconstitutional right; and (2) this violation was of a clearly\n\nestablished      right   of     which   a     reasonable     person    would    have\n\nknown.”     Ridpath v. Bd. of Governors Marshall Univ., 447 F.3d\n\n292, 306 (4th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nViewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,\n\nwe conclude that the defendants have failed to establish as a\n\nmatter of law that the 2010 Ramadan policy, as applied to the\n\nplaintiff, did not violate his First Amendment rights.                     We also\n\nhold that their alleged actions violated the plaintiff’s clearly\n\nestablished rights, and that they are therefore not entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\n      9\n        The plaintiff’s claims for equitable relief are not\naffected by the doctrine of qualified immunity, which “has no\napplication to suits for declaratory or injunctive relief.”\nSouth Carolina State Bd. of Dentistry v.

The     defendants           concede         that     denying           Wall    the\n\nopportunity to observe Ramadan imposed a substantial burden on\n\nhis religious freedom.\n\n      However,      free    exercise         restrictions           that   are      “reasonably\n\nadapted    to   achieving         a   legitimate        penological          objective”          are\n\npermissible.          Id.    at       200.        In    other       words,     then,          prison\n\nofficials may restrict an inmate’s religious practices subject\n\nto a “reasonableness” test that accords substantial deference to\n\nthe professional judgment of correctional officers.                                 See Overton\n\nv. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003). 10\n\n\n      10\n        This differs from the test utilized under RLUIPA, which\nrequires that restrictions be narrowly tailored to a compelling\ngovernment interest. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a). Thus, in the\n(Continued)\n                                                 14\n\f     A prison regulation is reasonable and thus permissible if\n\nit satisfies the four factors established in Turner v. Safley,\n\n482 U.S. 78 (1987).      That test asks:             (1) whether there is a\n\n“valid, rational connection” between the prison regulation or\n\naction and the interest asserted by the government, or whether\n\nthis interest is “so remote as to render the policy arbitrary or\n\nirrational”; (2) whether “alternative means of exercising the\n\nright . . . remain open to prison inmates”; (3) what impact the\n\ndesired accommodation would have on security staff, inmates, and\n\nthe allocation of prison resources; and (4) whether there exist\n\nany “obvious, easy alternatives” to the challenged regulation or\n\naction.    Lovelace, 472 F.3d at 200 (citing Turner, 482 U.S. at\n\n89-92).\n\n     As    a    preliminary     matter,         “prison       officials         may\n\nappropriately    question     whether      a     prisoner’s         religiosity,\n\nasserted   as   the   basis   for   a    requested        accommodation,        is\n\nauthentic.”     Cutter   v.

Accepting that prisons may\n\nlimit       religious        accommodations          to        sincere      believers,         the\n\nquestion       in    this    case      is     whether       ROSP’s     specific        means    of\n\ntesting Wall’s sincerity was permissible; that is, whether ROSP\n\nwas allowed to require him to possess specific, physical items\n\nof Islamic faith as proof of belief.\n\n       We     hold    that     under    the     current        record,      the    defendants’\n\napplication of the 2010 Ramadan policy fails an analysis under\n\nthe Turner factors. 11              First, demanding specific physical items\n\nas   proof      of     faith    will        rarely     be      an   acceptable         means   of\n\nachieving       the     prison’s        stated       interest        in     reducing      costs.\n\nStrict       application       of      such     a    rule      fails      even     a     rational\n\nconnection          requirement.            Although      we      recognize       that    prison\n\nofficials       must     make       determinations           of     who    is     entitled      to\n\naccommodations, it exceeds their authority to decide which, if\n\nany,        religious       relics      are     sufficiently              important       as   to\n\n\n       11\n        With limited exceptions, much of the material facts\nregarding the defendants’ actions are undisputed.    However, for\nthe plaintiff to ultimately succeed on remand, he must still\nprove that the defendants’ actions were intentional.    Lovelace,\n472 F.3d at 194-95, 201-02 (holding that suits under both RLUIPA\nand the First Amendment require a showing of “conscious or\nintentional interference” with the plaintiff’s rights).        In\nevaluating the legality of the policy in this section of the\nopinion, we focus on the largely undisputed allegations of the\ndefendants’ actions, and not their as yet unproven intent.\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\fconstitute an appropriate gauge of faith.                         This Court has held,\n\nalbeit       under   RLUIPA’s     more     exacting         standard,        that    prison\n\nadministrators       may   not    assume      that     a   “lack     of    sincerity     (or\n\nreligiosity) with respect to one practice [of a given religion]\n\nmeans lack of sincerity with respect to others.”                            Lovelace, 472\n\nF.3d    at    188.    Thus,      the   fact     that       Wall    did    not   have,    for\n\nexample, a prayer rug in his possession is not a sufficiently\n\nreliable indicator of whether he is a practicing Muslim.                                   A\n\nprison may not condition an inmate’s constitutionally protected\n\nrights on so narrow a set of grounds without “render[ing] the\n\npolicy arbitrary or irrational.”                Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-90.\n\n       Indeed, the circumstances of Wall’s case highlight exactly\n\nwhy such an unyielding policy is unreasonable.                             Despite Wall’s\n\nother outward manifestations of faith, most notably his past\n\nparticipation        in    Ramadan     and      common       fare        diet, 12   he   was\n\nprohibited from observing the fast solely because he did not\n\npossess any of the approved items.                   The defendants also ignored\n\nWall’s perfectly believable explanation, later verified, that he\n\ndid not have the items only because VDOC had lost all of his\n\n\n       12\n       The defendants note that members of a number of different\nfaiths receive the common fare diet, making it an over-inclusive\ntest.     However, Wall’s amended complaint states that he\npresented Selyers with his common fare signup form, which\nspecifically notes his Islamic faith as the justification for\nparticipating in the diet.\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fbelongings during his transfer to ROSP.                    Nor was Wall’s attempt\n\nto store food in his cell on the first day of Ramadan enough to\n\nconvince ROSP officials that he was sincere in his desire to\n\nobserve the fasting requirements.                Wall also continued to pursue\n\nthe issue after his initial denial, filing several grievances\n\nand requesting to be placed back on the list.                         The defendants\n\nrejected       these    requests     and     simply      reiterated    their     policy\n\nwithout further consideration of Wall’s circumstances.                        Finally,\n\nat least according to Wall, on August 21, 2011, Rowlette offered\n\nto place Wall back on the participation list provided he could\n\nverify that Wall’s belongings had actually been lost.                          Rowlette\n\nthen rescinded the offer once Wall stated that he intended to\n\npursue a formal adjudication of the matter regardless.                           Taking\n\nthis fact in the light most favorable to Wall, it indicates that\n\nthe officials were more interested in protecting their earlier\n\ndecision    than       in   honestly   discerning        whether    Wall     should   be\n\npermitted to participate.\n\n     In    short,       Wall   has   alleged      that    the   defendants      ignored\n\nnumerous signs that he is a practicing Muslim who was merely\n\nseeking to exercise his genuinely held beliefs.                     By applying the\n\npolicy    in    so     rigid   a   manner,      the   restriction     lost     whatever\n\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\f“valid, rational connection” to the government’s stated interest\n\nthat might have existed at the time it was adopted. 13\n\n      An analysis of the remaining Turner factors also supports\n\nthe   plaintiff’s    claims.     The   second   factor   asks    whether\n\n“alternative means of exercising the right . . . remain open to\n\n[the] prison[er].”     482 U.S. at 90.      It is clear that Wall was\n\nabsolutely   precluded   from   observing    Ramadan   because   of   the\n\ndefendants’ actions.     When he attempted to adhere to the fasting\n\nrequirements on his own by storing food in his cell, he was\n\nthreatened with disciplinary action.        The only alternative means\n\nproffered by the defendants is that had Wall obeyed the policy,\n\nhe would have been allowed to participate.        This suggestion, of\n\ncourse, it is not an “alternative means” at all, it is merely a\n\n\n      13\n        We note our disagreement with the defendants’ suggestion\nthat the Supreme Court’s decision in O’Lone v. Estate of\nShabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 350 (1987), is controlling.    In O’Lone,\nthe Court examined a prison’s policy of prohibiting inmates\nassigned to outside work duty from returning to the prison\nduring the day in order to attend Jumu’ah, an Islamic\ncongregational service held on Friday afternoons.    Id. at 349.\nThe Court deemed that the policy was logically related to the\nprison’s legitimate interest in maintaining “institutional order\nand security” by relieving overcrowding, easing “congestion and\ndelays at the main gate,” and lessening the pressure on the\nguards who previously had to evaluate individual return\nrequests.   Id. at 350-51.   While the O’Lone decision certainly\nsupports   the  general   proposition  that  courts   should  be\ndeferential to the decisions of prison administrators, the case\ndoes not examine the relevant issue in this case -- the\nreasonableness of a sincerity test –- and is therefore largely\ninapposite.\n\n\n\n                                  19\n\freiteration of the same rigid requirements Wall was unable to\n\nmeet. 14\n\n      We    also    believe     that    the       third     Turner      factor,    which\n\nexamines the impact the requested accommodation would have on\n\nthe prison’s efficient operation, also supports the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim.      482     U.S.   at   92.      We       are     not   satisfied    that    the\n\ndefendants have sufficiently explained how a less restrictive\n\npolicy     would    have    imposed     a        significant      burden    on    prison\n\nresources.         The defendants contend generally that Ramadan is\n\nexpensive because participants require special meals, and the\n\nschedules    of     both   inmates     and       guards    must    be   rearranged    to\n\naccommodate pre-dawn and post-sunset meals.                       However, the record\n\nis void of any specific information regarding these purported\n\ncosts, and we are not content to permit a prison to deny an\n\ninmate’s constitutional right in the face of such generalized\n\n\n      14\n       We recognize that in O’Lone the Supreme Court interpreted\nthe concept of alternative means broadly, asking not only\nwhether a particular religious practice has been impeded, but\ninstead addressing “all forms of religious exercise” of the\nprisoner’s faith.      482 U.S. at 352.        However, such an\ninterpretation is unduly restrictive with respect to Wall’s\ncase.   Ramadan, unlike Jumu’ah, is one of the five pillars of\nIslam, and its observance is integral to all practicing Muslims.\nMoreover, we have previously held that “a prisoner has a clearly\nestablished . . . right to a diet consistent with his . . .\nreligious scruples, including proper food during Ramadan.”\nLovelace, 472 F.3d at 198-99 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).   We decline to read O’Lone, decided before\nLovelace, as conflicting with the latter’s holding.\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fconcerns.        This is especially so in light of the negligible\n\ncosts associated with adding one additional inmate to an already\n\nexistent        program.         Nor    have          the     defendants         presented    a\n\nconvincing       argument       why    an    individualized            interpretation         in\n\nWall’s case would have been unduly burdensome.                             To the contrary,\n\nWall presented the officials with significant evidence of his\n\nMuslim faith, which the defendants could have accepted without\n\nthe need to conduct any further investigation on their own.\n\n       Finally, we are satisfied that there existed “easy[] [and]\n\nobvious alternatives” to the challenged regulation.                               Id. at 93.\n\nThis    is     most   plainly    seen       in    the       fact    that   ROSP    ultimately\n\nchanged its policy, which has since allowed Wall and others to\n\nobserve Ramadan without incident.                      Additionally, a VDOC guidance\n\ndocument issued June 25, 2010 addressed how inmates who were not\n\non     an     institution’s      designated            religious          pass    list    could\n\ndemonstrate           eligibility       for           Ramadan        observance.             One\n\nconsideration utilized was past involvement in Ramadan fasting.\n\nROSP, which does not maintain religious pass lists due to its\n\nstatus as a segregation facility, could have utilized the same,\n\nless restrictive criterion for determining eligibility.\n\n       In     sum,    viewing    the    current            record    in    the    light    most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiff, the defendants’ application of the\n\n2010        Ramadan    policy     to    Wall          was     unconstitutional.              The\n\ndefendants       relied    exclusively           on    a    narrow    set    of    parameters\n\n                                                 21\n\fwhile ignoring obvious indications of the sincerity of Wall’s\n\nbeliefs.    The First Amendment demands a more reasoned approach,\n\neven within the difficult confines of a prison environment. 15\n\n                                        2.\n\n     Having established a claim for a constitutional violation,\n\nwe must now ask whether the defendants transgressed law that was\n\n“clearly established” at the time of the violation.                     Ridpath,\n\n447 F.3d at 306.         We conclude that, given Wall’s circumstances,\n\nhis right to participate in Ramadan was clearly established, and\n\nthe defendants are therefore not entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n     As    noted,   we   have      previously   held    that   under   “the   Free\n\nExercise Clause . . . a prisoner has a clearly established . . .\n\nright to a diet consistent with his . . . religious scruples,\n\nincluding proper food during Ramadan.”                  Lovelace, 472 F.3d at\n\n198-99 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).     Further, “[a] prison official violates this clearly\n\nestablished    right     if   he    intentionally      and   without   sufficient\n\n\n     15\n        To be clear, we do not decide that prisons may never\nrequire some tangible evidence of faith in support of a\nreligious accommodation. Rather, our reasoning merely restricts\nprisons from requiring specific physical indicia of faith in the\nface of significant alternative evidence that an inmate’s\nbeliefs are sincere. Nor do we mean to suggest that bright line\nrules have no place in governing religious accommodation\nrequests, but only that prison officials may not turn a blind\neye to obvious justifications for exceptions when they present\nthemselves so plainly.\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\fjustification denies an inmate his religiously mandated diet.”\n\nId. at 199.      We take these statements to mean quite exactly what\n\nthey    say:     that   Wall’s   right     to   participate   in    Ramadan    was\n\nclearly established, and when the defendants abridged this right\n\nwithout     first   satisfying     Turner’s      reasonableness     test,     they\n\nsubjected      themselves   to    the    potential     for    liability.       As\n\nexpressed above, the defendants’ application of their policy to\n\nWall    was    unnecessarily     strict.        They   overlooked    (at    best)\n\nsignificant evidence that Wall was, in fact, a practicing Muslim\n\nwho was entitled to participate in Ramadan.               We cannot conclude\n\nthat a reasonable official in the defendants’ position, giving\n\nproper consideration to our statement in Lovelace that the right\n\nis clearly established, and to Turner’s objective reasonableness\n\ntest, would have felt it permissible to apply the policy in so\n\nstrict a fashion.\n\n       The defendants attempt to avoid this rather straightforward\n\nresult by arguing that there is a lack of case law elucidating\n\nexactly how prisons may utilize sincerity tests in determining\n\neligibility for religious accommodations.               While it may be true\n\nthat we have never specifically evaluated a sincerity test, 16\n\n\n       16\n       Although not directly on point, we believe the result in\nLovelace is relevant for reasons beyond its general affirmation\nthat inmates are entitled to religious dietary accommodations.\nIn that case, we reviewed a prison’s policy of removing inmates\nfrom its Ramadan list if they were observed breaking the fast\n(Continued)\n                                         23\n\fthis    argument        overlooks    the    broader     right    at   issue:        that\n\ninmates are entitled to religious dietary accommodations absent\n\na legitimate reason to the contrary.                     As we have previously\n\nstated,        clearly       established      “includes        not    only     already\n\nspecifically adjudicated rights, but those manifestly included\n\nwithin    more        general    applications    of     the    core   constitutional\n\nprinciple invoked.”             Pritchett v. Alford, 973 F.2d 307, 314 (4th\n\nCir. 1992).           In light of our unequivocal statement in Lovelace\n\nthat inmates are entitled to religious dietary accommodations,\n\nwe     need     not     to   have    previously       passed     judgment      on    the\n\nappropriateness of particular sincerity tests in order to demand\n\nthat    prison        officials     act    reasonably    in     administering       that\n\nright.        An expectation of reasonableness in this context is not\n\na high bar, and does not punish officials for “bad guesses in\n\ngray areas.”          Maciariello v. Sumner, 973 F.2d 295, 298 (4th Cir.\n\n1992).        To the contrary, it offers only a minimal level of\n\n\n\n\neven a single time. Lovelace, 472 F.3d at 181. We held that,\nunder RLUIPA’s more demanding standard, the policy was not the\nleast restrictive means of furthering the government’s interest\nin efficiently running the prison. Id. at 190-94. Although the\npolicy was intended as a disciplinary measure and the inmate’s\nsincerity was never in question, id. at 187 n. 2, the case\nremains an example of how a harsh and unyielding policy may be\nunlawful in the context of clearly protected individual rights.\nIt thus provided at least some degree of guidance to the\ndefendants in this case, if not enough to be dispositive.\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fprotection to inmates seeking to exercise their constitutionally\n\nprotected rights.\n\n     Having found that the plaintiff has established a claim for\n\na violation of his clearly established First Amendment rights,\n\nwe vacate the district court’s grant of summary judgment on the\n\nplaintiff’s First Amendment claim for damages.\n\n\n\n                                   III.\n\n     For the reasons explained above, we vacate the district\n\ncourt’s decision concluding that (1) the plaintiff’s equitable\n\nclaims   are   moot,   and   (2)   the    defendants   are   entitled   to\n\nqualified immunity on the plaintiff’s First Amendment damages\n\nclaim.   In so doing, we necessarily find that the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim under RLUIPA survives summary judgment as well, as such\n\nclaims are evaluated under the same factors, but subject to a\n\nless demanding standard of proof.           See Lovelace, 472 F.3d at\n\n190. Accordingly, we remand this action to the district court\n\nfor further    proceedings as appropriate.\n\n                                                   VACATED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                                    25\n\f",

As a member of\n\nthe   Nation   of    Islam,    in   2008       and    2009    Wall     was    allowed       to\n\nobserve the holy month of Ramadan while in state custody.                                   To\n\naccommodate       Ramadan     observance,            prison      officials             provide\n\nparticipating inmates with special meals served before sunrise\n\nand after sunset.           While at ROSP, Wall also received “common\n\nfare” meals, which satisfied his religious beliefs.\n\n      Prior to 2010, Muslim inmates at ROSP simply had to sign up\n\nto participate in Ramadan.            In 2009, approximately half of the\n\n                                           3\n\finmate population signed up.                  ROSP staff later determined that a\n\nsignificant number of the participating inmates were not, in\n\nfact,      practicing      Muslims.           As       a    result,         ROSP    devised     a   new\n\neligibility policy for 2010:                  in addition to signing up, inmates\n\nhad to provide some physical indicia of Islamic faith, such as a\n\nQuran, Kufi, prayer rug, or written religious material obtained\n\nfrom the prison Chaplain’s office. 1                             ROSP inmates who did not\n\nhave       such    materials      or    refused            to    acquire      them       were   deemed\n\ninsincere in their religious beliefs and were prohibited from\n\nparticipating in Ramadan. 2\n\n       Wall       was   one     of     the    inmates            who    was        not   allowed     to\n\nparticipate.            After    initially         signing            up,    Wall    was    asked    by\n\ndefendants James Wade, C. Selyers, and J. Stallard to provide\n\nphysical evidence of the sincerity of his beliefs in accordance\n\nwith       the    new   policy.        Wall    stated            that       all    his   belongings,\n\nincluding         his   articles       of     faith,            had    been       lost   during     his\n\n\n\n       1\n       This policy was somewhat unique among Virginia Department\nof Corrections (“VDOC”) facilities.     Most prisons maintain a\n“religious pass list,” which keeps track of which inmates\nparticipate in specific religious services.     However, because\nmost ROSP inmates are in long-term administrative segregation,\nROSP does not offer group religious services.       Consequently,\nROSP does not keep a religious pass list.\n       2\n       In 2010, with the new policy in place, only 176 of the 360\ninmates who signed up to participate provided the necessary\nmaterials. The other 187 inmates were prohibited from observing\nthe fasting hours.\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\ftransfer to ROSP.          He showed Wade a state court judgment against\n\nthe Commonwealth as proof that VDOC had lost his possessions. 3\n\nWall       also    produced      documents    showing   that    he   was   receiving\n\ncommon fare meals in accordance with his faith, and he informed\n\nthe officers that he had observed Ramadan in 2008 and 2009.\n\nDespite this, Wade responded, “that don’t mean anything,” and\n\ninstructed Stallard and Selyers to remove Wall from the Ramadan\n\nlist.       J.A. 139.\n\n       Wall       then   filed    an    informal   complaint,    again     explaining\n\nthat his religious materials had been lost and requesting to be\n\nallowed to participate.                In a memo in response to the complaint,\n\nWade reiterated ROSP’s new policy, stating:\n\n       [ROSP] does not have religious services so the\n       following rules apply to this institution.

ROSP staff found the food and\n\nthreatened to charge him with possessing contraband.                         Faced with\n\nchoosing between starvation and sanctions, Wall ate during the\n\nday and violated his religious beliefs.\n\n       On August 15, Wall filed a formal grievance, which was also\n\ndenied.      Six days later, he had a conversation with Wade and\n\nAssistant Warden Robert Rowlette, in which Rowlette asked if he\n\nwould like to be put back on the Ramadan list provided it could\n\nbe verified that he had truly lost his belongings.                         According to\n\nWall, he responded that he still wanted to participate, but that\n\nhe also wanted an explanation for why he was taken off the list\n\nin the first place.          Rowlette replied, “[o]kay,” and then walked\n\naway while Wall shouted “I want to participate in Ramadan!                               I\n\nwant    my   Ramadan,       Rowlette!”        J.A.    140.         According      to   the\n\ndefendants, however, Wall refused Rowlette’s offer to be put\n\nback on the list, saying, “[n]o, I’m going to pursue this in\n\ncourt.”         J.A.   93.      Ultimately,          Wall    was     not    allowed    to\n\nparticipate in Ramadan in 2010.\n\n       Having     exhausted    his    administrative         remedies,      Wall   filed\n\nsuit under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons\n\nAct    (“RLUIPA”),     42    U.S.C.    § 2000cc,       et    seq.,    and    42    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983.      In an amended complaint, Wall alleged violations of\n\nRLUIPA and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, in\n\naddition     to   several     related    state       law    claims.        The    amended\n\n                                          6\n\fcomplaint        sought      “[a]     declaratory        judgment,      nominal       damages,\n\nunspecified joint and several compensatory damages, $10,000 in\n\npunitive damages from each defendant, and any additional relief\n\nthis court deems just, proper, and equitable.”                          J.A. 32-33.\n\n       Shortly after the suit was filed, Wall was transferred out\n\nof     ROSP     to    a     lower-security         facility.           Subsequently,         the\n\ndistrict        court       granted      the   defendants’         motion      for        summary\n\njudgment, finding that any claims for equitable relief were moot\n\nfollowing Wall’s transfer, and ruling that the defendants were\n\nentitled        to   qualified      immunity       on    the     plaintiff’s        claim    for\n\ndamages.\n\n       Following the district court’s ruling, Wall was transferred\n\nback       to   ROSP.        The    defendants          claim    that     ROSP      has    since\n\nabandoned its policy of requiring prisoners to possess physical\n\nindicia of faith in order to participate in Ramadan or other\n\nreligious observations.                  The new policy, adopted in a September\n\n13, 2011 memo by VDOC’s Chief of Corrections Operations, 4 states\n\nthat       inmates     in    segregation       facilities,         such       as    ROSP,    may\n\ndemonstrate          sincerity      by    showing    that       they   have    in    the    past\n\nborrowed religious material such as DVDs, CDs, or literature\n\n       4\n       The memo was not submitted as evidence in this case and is\ntherefore not part of the record, but it was referenced in a\nrelated case involving the same policy.

Accepting that prisons may\n\nlimit       religious        accommodations          to        sincere      believers,         the\n\nquestion       in    this    case      is     whether       ROSP’s     specific        means    of\n\ntesting Wall’s sincerity was permissible; that is, whether ROSP\n\nwas allowed to require him to possess specific, physical items\n\nof Islamic faith as proof of belief.\n\n       We     hold    that     under    the     current        record,      the    defendants’\n\napplication of the 2010 Ramadan policy fails an analysis under\n\nthe Turner factors. 11              First, demanding specific physical items\n\nas   proof      of     faith    will        rarely     be      an   acceptable         means   of\n\nachieving       the     prison’s        stated       interest        in     reducing      costs.\n\nStrict       application       of      such     a    rule      fails      even     a     rational\n\nconnection          requirement.            Although      we      recognize       that    prison\n\nofficials       must     make       determinations           of     who    is     entitled      to\n\naccommodations, it exceeds their authority to decide which, if\n\nany,        religious       relics      are     sufficiently              important       as   to\n\n\n       11\n        With limited exceptions, much of the material facts\nregarding the defendants’ actions are undisputed.    However, for\nthe plaintiff to ultimately succeed on remand, he must still\nprove that the defendants’ actions were intentional.    Lovelace,\n472 F.3d at 194-95, 201-02 (holding that suits under both RLUIPA\nand the First Amendment require a showing of “conscious or\nintentional interference” with the plaintiff’s rights).        In\nevaluating the legality of the policy in this section of the\nopinion, we focus on the largely undisputed allegations of the\ndefendants’ actions, and not their as yet unproven intent.\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\fconstitute an appropriate gauge of faith.                         This Court has held,\n\nalbeit       under   RLUIPA’s     more     exacting         standard,        that    prison\n\nadministrators       may   not    assume      that     a   “lack     of    sincerity     (or\n\nreligiosity) with respect to one practice [of a given religion]\n\nmeans lack of sincerity with respect to others.”                            Lovelace, 472\n\nF.3d    at    188.    Thus,      the   fact     that       Wall    did    not   have,    for\n\nexample, a prayer rug in his possession is not a sufficiently\n\nreliable indicator of whether he is a practicing Muslim.                                   A\n\nprison may not condition an inmate’s constitutionally protected\n\nrights on so narrow a set of grounds without “render[ing] the\n\npolicy arbitrary or irrational.”                Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-90.\n\n       Indeed, the circumstances of Wall’s case highlight exactly\n\nwhy such an unyielding policy is unreasonable.                             Despite Wall’s\n\nother outward manifestations of faith, most notably his past\n\nparticipation        in    Ramadan     and      common       fare        diet, 12   he   was\n\nprohibited from observing the fast solely because he did not\n\npossess any of the approved items.                   The defendants also ignored\n\nWall’s perfectly believable explanation, later verified, that he\n\ndid not have the items only because VDOC had lost all of his\n\n\n       12\n       The defendants note that members of a number of different\nfaiths receive the common fare diet, making it an over-inclusive\ntest.     However, Wall’s amended complaint states that he\npresented Selyers with his common fare signup form, which\nspecifically notes his Islamic faith as the justification for\nparticipating in the diet.\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fbelongings during his transfer to ROSP.                    Nor was Wall’s attempt\n\nto store food in his cell on the first day of Ramadan enough to\n\nconvince ROSP officials that he was sincere in his desire to\n\nobserve the fasting requirements.                Wall also continued to pursue\n\nthe issue after his initial denial, filing several grievances\n\nand requesting to be placed back on the list.                         The defendants\n\nrejected       these    requests     and     simply      reiterated    their     policy\n\nwithout further consideration of Wall’s circumstances.                        Finally,\n\nat least according to Wall, on August 21, 2011, Rowlette offered\n\nto place Wall back on the participation list provided he could\n\nverify that Wall’s belongings had actually been lost.                          Rowlette\n\nthen rescinded the offer once Wall stated that he intended to\n\npursue a formal adjudication of the matter regardless.                           Taking\n\nthis fact in the light most favorable to Wall, it indicates that\n\nthe officials were more interested in protecting their earlier\n\ndecision    than       in   honestly   discerning        whether    Wall     should   be\n\npermitted to participate.\n\n     In    short,       Wall   has   alleged      that    the   defendants      ignored\n\nnumerous signs that he is a practicing Muslim who was merely\n\nseeking to exercise his genuinely held beliefs.                     By applying the\n\npolicy    in    so     rigid   a   manner,      the   restriction     lost     whatever\n\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\f“valid, rational connection” to the government’s stated interest\n\nthat might have existed at the time it was adopted. 13\n\n      An analysis of the remaining Turner factors also supports\n\nthe   plaintiff’s    claims.     The   second   factor   asks    whether\n\n“alternative means of exercising the right . . . remain open to\n\n[the] prison[er].”     482 U.S. at 90.      It is clear that Wall was\n\nabsolutely   precluded   from   observing    Ramadan   because   of   the\n\ndefendants’ actions.     When he attempted to adhere to the fasting\n\nrequirements on his own by storing food in his cell, he was\n\nthreatened with disciplinary action.        The only alternative means\n\nproffered by the defendants is that had Wall obeyed the policy,\n\nhe would have been allowed to participate.        This suggestion, of\n\ncourse, it is not an “alternative means” at all, it is merely a\n\n\n      13\n        We note our disagreement with the defendants’ suggestion\nthat the Supreme Court’s decision in O’Lone v. Estate of\nShabazz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111913\"><a href=\"/opinion/111913/olone-v-estate-of-shabazz/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 350 (1987), is controlling.    In O’Lone,\nthe Court examined a prison’s policy of prohibiting inmates\nassigned to outside work duty from returning to the prison\nduring the day in order to attend Jumu’ah, an Islamic\ncongregational service held on Friday afternoons.    Id. at 349.\nThe Court deemed that the policy was logically related to the\nprison’s legitimate interest in maintaining “institutional order\nand security” by relieving overcrowding, easing “congestion and\ndelays at the main gate,” and lessening the pressure on the\nguards who previously had to evaluate individual return\nrequests.   Id. at 350-51.   While the O’Lone decision certainly\nsupports   the  general   proposition  that  courts   should  be\ndeferential to the decisions of prison administrators, the case\ndoes not examine the relevant issue in this case -- the\nreasonableness of a sincerity test –- and is therefore largely\ninapposite.\n\n\n\n                                  19\n\freiteration of the same rigid requirements Wall was unable to\n\nmeet. 14\n\n      We    also    believe     that    the       third     Turner      factor,    which\n\nexamines the impact the requested accommodation would have on\n\nthe prison’s efficient operation, also supports the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim.      482     U.S.   at   92.      We       are     not   satisfied    that    the\n\ndefendants have sufficiently explained how a less restrictive\n\npolicy     would    have    imposed     a        significant      burden    on    prison\n\nresources.         The defendants contend generally that Ramadan is\n\nexpensive because participants require special meals, and the\n\nschedules    of     both   inmates     and       guards    must    be   rearranged    to\n\naccommodate pre-dawn and post-sunset meals.                       However, the record\n\nis void of any specific information regarding these purported\n\ncosts, and we are not content to permit a prison to deny an\n\ninmate’s constitutional right in the face of such generalized\n\n\n      14\n       We recognize that in O’Lone the Supreme Court interpreted\nthe concept of alternative means broadly, asking not only\nwhether a particular religious practice has been impeded, but\ninstead addressing “all forms of religious exercise” of the\nprisoner’s faith.      482 U.S. at 352.        However, such an\ninterpretation is unduly restrictive with respect to Wall’s\ncase.   Ramadan, unlike Jumu’ah, is one of the five pillars of\nIslam, and its observance is integral to all practicing Muslims.\nMoreover, we have previously held that “a prisoner has a clearly\nestablished . . . right to a diet consistent with his . . .\nreligious scruples, including proper food during Ramadan.”\nLovelace, 472 F.3d at 198-99 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).   We decline to read O’Lone, decided before\nLovelace, as conflicting with the latter’s holding.\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fconcerns.        This is especially so in light of the negligible\n\ncosts associated with adding one additional inmate to an already\n\nexistent        program.         Nor    have          the     defendants         presented    a\n\nconvincing       argument       why    an    individualized            interpretation         in\n\nWall’s case would have been unduly burdensome.                             To the contrary,\n\nWall presented the officials with significant evidence of his\n\nMuslim faith, which the defendants could have accepted without\n\nthe need to conduct any further investigation on their own.\n\n       Finally, we are satisfied that there existed “easy[] [and]\n\nobvious alternatives” to the challenged regulation.                               Id. at 93.\n\nThis    is     most   plainly    seen       in    the       fact    that   ROSP    ultimately\n\nchanged its policy, which has since allowed Wall and others to\n\nobserve Ramadan without incident.                      Additionally, a VDOC guidance\n\ndocument issued June 25, 2010 addressed how inmates who were not\n\non     an     institution’s      designated            religious          pass    list    could\n\ndemonstrate           eligibility       for           Ramadan        observance.             One\n\nconsideration utilized was past involvement in Ramadan fasting.\n\nROSP, which does not maintain religious pass lists due to its\n\nstatus as a segregation facility, could have utilized the same,\n\nless restrictive criterion for determining eligibility.\n\n       In     sum,    viewing    the    current            record    in    the    light    most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiff, the defendants’ application of the\n\n2010        Ramadan    policy     to    Wall          was     unconstitutional.              The\n\ndefendants       relied    exclusively           on    a    narrow    set    of    parameters\n\n                                                 21\n\fwhile ignoring obvious indications of the sincerity of Wall’s\n\nbeliefs.    The First Amendment demands a more reasoned approach,\n\neven within the difficult confines of a prison environment. 15\n\n                                        2.\n\n     Having established a claim for a constitutional violation,\n\nwe must now ask whether the defendants transgressed law that was\n\n“clearly established” at the time of the violation.                     Ridpath,\n\n447 F.3d at 306.         We conclude that, given Wall’s circumstances,\n\nhis right to participate in Ramadan was clearly established, and\n\nthe defendants are therefore not entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n     As    noted,   we   have      previously   held    that   under   “the   Free\n\nExercise Clause . . . a prisoner has a clearly established . . .\n\nright to a diet consistent with his . . . religious scruples,\n\nincluding proper food during Ramadan.”                  Lovelace, 472 F.3d at\n\n198-99 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).     Further, “[a] prison official violates this clearly\n\nestablished    right     if   he    intentionally      and   without   sufficient\n\n\n     15\n        To be clear, we do not decide that prisons may never\nrequire some tangible evidence of faith in support of a\nreligious accommodation. Rather, our reasoning merely restricts\nprisons from requiring specific physical indicia of faith in the\nface of significant alternative evidence that an inmate’s\nbeliefs are sincere. Nor do we mean to suggest that bright line\nrules have no place in governing religious accommodation\nrequests, but only that prison officials may not turn a blind\neye to obvious justifications for exceptions when they present\nthemselves so plainly.\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\fjustification denies an inmate his religiously mandated diet.”\n\nId. at 199.      We take these statements to mean quite exactly what\n\nthey    say:     that   Wall’s   right     to   participate   in    Ramadan    was\n\nclearly established, and when the defendants abridged this right\n\nwithout     first   satisfying     Turner’s      reasonableness     test,     they\n\nsubjected      themselves   to    the    potential     for    liability.       As\n\nexpressed above, the defendants’ application of their policy to\n\nWall    was    unnecessarily     strict.        They   overlooked    (at    best)\n\nsignificant evidence that Wall was, in fact, a practicing Muslim\n\nwho was entitled to participate in Ramadan.               We cannot conclude\n\nthat a reasonable official in the defendants’ position, giving\n\nproper consideration to our statement in Lovelace that the right\n\nis clearly established, and to Turner’s objective reasonableness\n\ntest, would have felt it permissible to apply the policy in so\n\nstrict a fashion.\n\n       The defendants attempt to avoid this rather straightforward\n\nresult by arguing that there is a lack of case law elucidating\n\nexactly how prisons may utilize sincerity tests in determining\n\neligibility for religious accommodations.               While it may be true\n\nthat we have never specifically evaluated a sincerity test, 16\n\n\n       16\n       Although not directly on point, we believe the result in\nLovelace is relevant for reasons beyond its general affirmation\nthat inmates are entitled to religious dietary accommodations.\nIn that case, we reviewed a prison’s policy of removing inmates\nfrom its Ramadan list if they were observed breaking the fast\n(Continued)\n                                         23\n\fthis    argument        overlooks    the    broader     right    at   issue:        that\n\ninmates are entitled to religious dietary accommodations absent\n\na legitimate reason to the contrary.                     As we have previously\n\nstated,        clearly       established      “includes        not    only     already\n\nspecifically adjudicated rights, but those manifestly included\n\nwithin    more        general    applications    of     the    core   constitutional\n\nprinciple invoked.”             Pritchett v. Alford, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314 (4th\n\nCir. 1992).           In light of our unequivocal statement in Lovelace\n\nthat inmates are entitled to religious dietary accommodations,\n\nwe     need     not     to   have    previously       passed     judgment      on    the\n\nappropriateness of particular sincerity tests in order to demand\n\nthat    prison        officials     act    reasonably    in     administering       that\n\nright.        An expectation of reasonableness in this context is not\n\na high bar, and does not punish officials for “bad guesses in\n\ngray areas.”          Maciariello v. Sumner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589688\"><a href=\"/opinion/589688/robert-p-maciariello-arnold-rowell-v-wb-sumner-chief-of-police-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298 (4th Cir.\n\n1992).        To the contrary, it offers only a minimal level of\n\n\n\n\neven a single time. Lovelace, 472 F.3d at 181. We held that,\nunder RLUIPA’s more demanding standard, the policy was not the\nleast restrictive means of furthering the government’s interest\nin efficiently running the prison. Id. at 190-94. Although the\npolicy was intended as a disciplinary measure and the inmate’s\nsincerity was never in question, id. at 187 n. 2, the case\nremains an example of how a harsh and unyielding policy may be\nunlawful in the context of clearly protected individual rights.\nIt thus provided at least some degree of guidance to the\ndefendants in this case, if not enough to be dispositive.\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fprotection to inmates seeking to exercise their constitutionally\n\nprotected rights.\n\n     Having found that the plaintiff has established a claim for\n\na violation of his clearly established First Amendment rights,\n\nwe vacate the district court’s grant of summary judgment on the\n\nplaintiff’s First Amendment claim for damages.\n\n\n\n                                   III.\n\n     For the reasons explained above, we vacate the district\n\ncourt’s decision concluding that (1) the plaintiff’s equitable\n\nclaims   are   moot,   and   (2)   the    defendants   are   entitled   to\n\nqualified immunity on the plaintiff’s First Amendment damages\n\nclaim.   In so doing, we necessarily find that the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim under RLUIPA survives summary judgment as well, as such\n\nclaims are evaluated under the same factors, but subject to a\n\nless demanding standard of proof.           See Lovelace, 472 F.3d at\n\n190. Accordingly, we remand this action to the district court\n\nfor further    proceedings as appropriate.\n\n                                                   VACATED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                                    25\n\f</pre>",
