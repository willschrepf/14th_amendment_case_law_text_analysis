(\"the Landlord\") sued Agustin Zurita for breach of a\r\ncommercial lease; AZ Restaurant Ventures, LLC (\"AZR\") intervened and filed claims against the\r\nLandlord for conversion and tortious interference.  After a bench trial, the trial court rendered\r\njudgment against Zurita on the Landlord's breach-of-contract claim and against AZR on its\r\nconversion and tortious-interference claims.  The judgment awarded the Landlord damages, pre- and\r\npost-judgment interest, and attorneys' fees, and held Zurita and AZR jointly and severally liable for \r\nthe attorneys' fee award.  The trial court also concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Zurita's\r\nand AZR's requests for declarations regarding the existence and priority of liens on certain restaurant\r\nequipment AZR had purchased with financing from a third party.  In four issues, AZR and Zurita\r\ncontend that the trial court erred in (1) rendering judgment that AZR take nothing on its conversion\r\nclaim; (2) concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over Zurita's and AZR's requests for declaratory\r\nrelief; (3) holding Zurita and AZR jointly and severally liable for attorneys' fees awarded to the\r\nLandlord; and (4) making certain procedural rulings that were arbitrary and capricious and denied\r\nthem a fair trial.  We will modify the trial court's judgment and, as modified, affirm.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe Landlord owns the Sunset Valley Homestead Shopping Center located in Austin. \r\nIn March 2007, the Landlord and Zurita executed a commercial lease for approximately 3,000 square\r\nfeet of space in the shopping center.  The lease provided that \"Tenant will use the Premises to\r\noperate a restaurant whose primary business is a sandwich bar.\"  Because Zurita intended to operate\r\nthe restaurant through a separate entity that had not yet been formed, the lease included a provision\r\nsetting forth the Landlord's consent to a \"one-time\" assignment of the lease, to be executed before\r\nthe date the leased premises were deemed by the Landlord to be ready for occupancy, to an entity\r\ncreated to operate the restaurant and \"whose managing principal is Agustin Zurita.\"  After the lease\r\nwas signed, Zurita formed Z &amp; P Sunset Valley Food but failed to execute an assignment of the lease\r\nto that entity prior to the date on which the premises were ready for occupancy.  Consequently, Zurita\r\nremained the tenant on the lease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe lease also granted the Landlord a lien on certain personal property located on\r\nthe premises:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tLANDLORD SHALL HAVE AND TENANT HEREBY GRANTS TO\r\nLANDLORD A CONTINUING SECURITY INTEREST FOR ALL RENTALS\r\nAND OTHER SUMS OF MONEY DUE OR TO BECOME DUE HEREUNDER\r\nFROM TENANT, UPON ALL GOODS, WARES, EQUIPMENT, FIXTURES,\r\nFURNITURE, INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS, DOCUMENTS, GENERAL\r\nINTANGIBLES, CHATTEL PAPER, DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, DOCUMENTS,\r\nINSTRUMENTS, INVESTMENT PROPERTY AND OTHER PERSONAL\r\nPROPERTY OF TENANT NOW OWNED OR HEREAFTER ACQUIRED\r\n(COLLECTIVELY \"COLLATERAL\") AND SITUATED (OR DOCUMENTS\r\nEVIDENCING SUCH COLLATERAL KEPT) ON, AT, OR WITHIN THE\r\nPREMISES, WHICH IS LOCATED AT <strong>Sunset Valley Homestead Shopping\r\nCenter, SEC Hwy 290 and Brodie Lane, Austin, Texas.</strong> . . . THIS SECURITY\r\nAGREEMENT AND FINANCING STATEMENT ALSO COVERS FIXTURES\r\nLOCATED AT THE PREMISES DESCRIBED IN <span>EXHIBIT A</span> AND <span>EXHIBIT B</span>\r\nATTACHED HERETO, AND MAY BE FILED FOR RECORD IN THE\r\nREAL ESTATE RECORDS FOR THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE PREMISES\r\nARE LOCATED.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Exhibits A and B provided specific descriptions of the premises leased by Zurita.  Pursuant to this\r\nprovision, in the event of Zurita's default under the lease, the Landlord would have all rights and\r\nremedies of a secured creditor under the Uniform Commercial Code, including the right to sell the\r\nproperty subject to the security interest granted by Zurita.  <em>See</em> Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann.\r\n§§ 9.101-.709 (West 2011).  When Zurita signed the lease granting the security interest, the leased\r\npremises were unfinished, and no equipment, fixtures, furniture, or other items were located there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAt trial, Zurita testified that after the premises were ready for occupancy, AZR\r\npurchased the restaurant equipment and furnishings.  In connection with this purchase, AZR entered\r\ninto financing agreements with US Bancorp.  AZR is a limited liability company formed in 2006 and\r\nowned solely by Zurita.  According to Zurita, AZR had legal title to the equipment and furnishings\r\nlocated in the leased premises, and US Bancorp had a purchase money security interest in the\r\nfinanced items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe ten-year lease term commenced in September 2007.  In January 2008 Zurita\r\nbegan defaulting on rent payments.  In June 2008 Zurita sent a letter to the Landlord informing it that\r\nhe had decided to close the restaurant.  The next day, the Landlord sent Zurita a letter informing him\r\nthat, due to his default in paying rent, and because he had given notice that he was vacating the\r\nleased premises, it was exercising its right to terminate Zurita's right to possession of the premises. \r\nThereafter, the Landlord informed Zurita in writing that, if he failed to pay the balance due for\r\nunpaid rent, it intended to proceed with disposition of the contents of the leased premises, claiming\r\na security interest in that property pursuant to the terms of the lease.  Through his counsel, Zurita\r\nrequested that no action be taken until counsel had an opportunity to investigate the facts and\r\nexpressed a particular concern that the items the Landlord claimed a security interest in were subject\r\nto a subordination agreement in favor of US Bancorp.  During the parties' subsequent settlement\r\nnegotiations, which failed, counsel for Zurita learned that there was no subordination agreement\r\ncovering the contents of the leased premises.  The Landlord gave notice of a November 13, 2008\r\npublic sale and disposition of collateral, including all non-affixed contents of the leased premises. \r\nThe letter also stated that \"[a]ll fixtures have reverted to the Landlord in accordance with the law.\" \r\nAt the sale, one of Zurita's business associates bid $50,000 for the property, but later withdrew the\r\nbid.  Consequently, the Landlord's opening bid of $25,000 was the winning bid.  The Landlord\r\ncredited the $25,000 against Zurita's debt to it under the lease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe Landlord filed its original petition against Zurita on October 17, 2008 alleging\r\nbreach of the lease and seeking damages for past-due rent payment, various expenses, late fees, and\r\nother charges.  Zurita filed a general denial and requested a declaration that US Bancorp had a lien\r\non personal property that was superior to the Landlord's.  Zurita also filed counterclaims for: \r\n(1) conversion, based on his assertion that AZR held legal title to the property, and consequently the\r\nsecurity interest granted to the Landlord by Zurita had not attached to the property sold; (2) tortious\r\ninterference with a contractual relationship between US Bancorp and AZR; (3) violation of a right\r\nto redeem, based on the Landlord's alleged refusal to accept Zurita's offer to pay his debt to the\r\nLandlord, including attorneys' fees; and (4) common law fraud, based on allegedly false\r\nrepresentations Zurita claimed the Landlord made in connection with Zurita's attempts to redeem\r\nthe property.  Zurita later added a counterclaim for \"failure to mitigate.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn April 2009 AZR filed a plea in intervention seeking a declaration that it had legal\r\ntitle to the property sold and that the Landlord had no valid lien on that property.  AZR also asserted\r\ncauses of action for:  (1) conversion, based on the Landlord's allegedly unlawful foreclosure and sale\r\nof the property at public auction; and (2) tortious interference with a contractual relationship between\r\nAZR and US Bancorp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe trial court subsequently granted the Landlord's motion for summary judgment\r\non Zurita's liability for breach of the lease.  The court also ordered that the Landlord recover from\r\nZurita its damages and attorneys' fees in amounts to be determined by the factfinder.  In his third\r\namended answer, Zurita dropped his request for declaratory relief and all previously asserted\r\ncounterclaims.  This amended answer contained only Zurita's general denial, an affirmative defense\r\nthat the Landlord failed to mitigate its damages, and a request for attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAfter a bench trial, the trial court awarded the Landlord $284,838.80 against Zurita\r\non the breach-of-contract claim.  The court rendered judgment against AZR on its conversion and\r\ntortious interference claims.  The court denied the Landlord's claim for reverse veil-piercing against\r\nZurita and AZR.  The court reduced the amount of actual damages awarded to the Landlord for\r\nZurita's breach of the lease agreement by $25,000 due to its conclusion that the Landlord failed to\r\nproperly conduct a foreclosure under Uniform Commercial Code article 9 but also found that the\r\nforeclosure sale did serve to pass title to the property despite the defect.  The order also held Zurita\r\nand AZR jointly and severally liable for $85,000 in attorneys' fees awarded to the Landlord. \r\nAfter rendering judgment, the trial court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  This\r\nappeal followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong></strong><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn their first issue, Zurita and AZR challenge the trial court's judgment against AZR\r\non its conversion claim.  They assert that the record conclusively demonstrates that AZR, not Zurita,\r\nhad legal title to the property the Landlord foreclosed on and sold at public auction, that Zurita could\r\nnot have granted the Landlord a security interest in the property the Landlord sold, and that the\r\nLandlord's disposition of AZR's property was therefore wrongful.  As demonstrated by the findings\r\nof fact and conclusions of law detailed below, the trial court determined that the Landlord's\r\nforeclosure and sale of the property was not wrongful, and therefore did not constitute conversion,\r\nbecause Zurita could and did grant to the Landlord a security interest in the property located within\r\nthe leased premises to secure payment for rent and other sums due under the lease:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tFOF 9:\tZurita granted a continuing security interest in all of the personal\r\nproperty situated on, at, or within the premises to [the Landlord] to\r\nsecure payment for rent and other sums due under the lease.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tFOF 10:\tOn October 30, 2007, [the Landlord] filed a UCC Financing\r\nStatement with the Texas Secretary of State.

What otherwise might be a question of fact becomes\r\none of law when the fact is not in dispute or is conclusively established.  <em>See Tenneco Inc.\r\nv. Enterprise Prods. Co.</em>, 925 S.W.2d 640, 643 (Tex. 1996).  Although a trial court's conclusions\r\nof law may not be challenged for factual sufficiency, we may review the legal conclusions drawn\r\nfrom the facts to determine whether the conclusions are correct.  <em>Id.</em>  We review a trial court's\r\nfindings of fact for legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence using the same standards applied to\r\na jury verdict.  <em>Ortiz v. Jones</em>, 917 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex. 1996).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tA party alleging conversion must show that:  (1) it owned, possessed, or had the\r\nright to immediate possession of personal property; (2) the defendant wrongfully exercised dominion\r\nor control over such property; and (3) the owner suffered injury.  <em>See Green Int'l v. Solis</em>,\r\n951 S.W.2d 384, 391 (Tex. 1997); <em>United Mobile Networks, L.P. v. Deaton</em>, 939 S.W.2d 146, 147\r\n(Tex. 1997); <em>Khorsid, Inc. v. Christian</em>, 257 S.W.3d 748, 759 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2008, no pet.). \r\nThe parties here do not dispute that AZR had legal title to the property or that the Landlord exercised\r\ndominion or control over it.  The dispute is whether the Landlord's conduct was wrongful.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Was the Landlord's disposition of the property wrongful?</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe Landlord asserted, and the trial court agreed, that its disposition of the property\r\nwas lawful because it was exercising its rights as a secured creditor with a perfected security interest\r\nin the property.  Zurita and AZR, on the other hand, contend that the Landlord did not have a valid\r\nsecurity interest in the property because (1) Zurita had no power to grant the Landlord a security\r\ninterest in property owned by AZR, and (2) by its terms, the granting language limited the security\r\ninterest to property <em>owned by Zurita</em>.  The security agreement plainly granted the Landlord a security\r\ninterest in property \"owned or hereafter acquired\" by Zurita, and located in the leased premises. \r\nZurita and AZR assert that the security interest therefore attached only to property to which Zurita\r\nheld or acquired legal title.  We disagree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tFor a security interest to attach to the collateral, the debtor must have \"rights in the\r\ncollateral <em>or the power to transfer rights in the collateral to the secured party</em>.\"  Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.\r\nCode Ann. § 9.203(b)(2) (emphasis added).  As a general rule, a security interest attaches only to\r\nwhatever rights the debtor may have in the collateral, broad or limited as those rights may be. \r\nHowever, comment 6 to section 9-203 observes that the italicized phrase accommodates exceptions\r\nto the general rule that \"enable a debtor to transfer, and a security interest to attach to, greater rights\r\nthan the debtor has.\"  <em>Id.</em> cmt. 6.  Such an exception exists here.  It is undisputed that Zurita is the\r\nsole owner of AZR.  Consequently, he had the power to transfer rights in property to which his\r\ncompany, AZR, held legal title.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWith respect to AZR and Zurita's contention that the language of the Landlord's lien\r\nitself does not cover property to which Zurita does not have legal title, we note that the provision\r\npurports to grant a security interest in property Zurita \"owned or hereafter acquired.\"  We do not\r\nagree that this granting language limits the collateral subject to the security interest to only those\r\nitems to which Zurita had legal title.  The Uniform Commercial Code does not equate a debtor's\r\nrights in collateral with its possession of legal title.  <em>See In re Whatley</em>, 874 F.2d 997, 1004 (5th Cir.\r\n1989) (holding bankruptcy court erred in equating debtor's rights in collateral with its possession\r\nof legal title and observing that \"[t]he Uniform Commercial Code does not equate the two concepts;\r\nthey are not the same\").  A debtor need not have legal title to equipment in order to grant a creditor\r\na security interest.  <em>Id.</em> (citing <em>Matter of Samuels &amp; Co., Inc.</em>, 526 F.2d 1238 (5th Cir. 1987)\r\n(en banc)). While the Uniform Commercial Code does not define the term \"rights in the collateral,\"\r\nit is generally recognized that legal title is not required and that rights in the collateral may be\r\nsufficient if the true owner consents to the debtor's use of the collateral as security, or if the true\r\nowner is estopped from denying the creation of the security interest because he has allowed another\r\nto appear as the owner, or as having full power of disposition over the property, so that an innocent\r\nperson is led into dealing with such apparent owner.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>In re Pubs, Inc. of Champaign</em>,\r\n618 F.2d 432, 437-38 (7th Cir. 1980) (applying Illinois law).<sup> (1)</sup>  Although we have found no Texas\r\ncases directly on point, \"all of the courts that have considered the question have ruled that an owner's\r\npermission to use goods as collateral creates rights in the debtor sufficient to give rise to an\r\nenforceable security interest.\"  <em>In re WL Homes, LLC</em>, 452 B.R. 138, 142 (Bankr. D. Del. 2011)\r\n(citing<em> Merchants Bank v. Atchison</em>, 832 F.2d 1236, 1239 (11th Cir. 1987)); <em>see also Franklin Bank\r\nv. Tindall &amp; Co.</em>, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27765, at *18 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 7, 2008).  Here, the\r\nlandlord's lien specifically identifies that it attaches to \"all goods, wares, equipment fixtures,\r\nfurniture, inventory, accounts, documents, instruments, investment property, and other personal\r\nproperty\" that Zurita owns or hereafter acquires and that are located at the leased premises.  Because\r\nthe UCC does not equate ownership rights sufficient to convey a security interest with legal title,\r\nZurita had sufficient rights in the collateral to \"own\" it for purposes of granting a security interest,\r\nand the description of the collateral contained in the lease provision purports to grant to the Landlord\r\na security interest in all such property.  This conclusion is consistent with the purposes and goals of\r\nthe Uniform Commercial Code, which was designed, in part, \"to prevent hidden-title subterfuge in\r\nwhich the true owner of collateral, by permitting another party to exercise an outward appearance\r\nof ownership, could deceive third-party creditors to their detriment.\"  <em>Kinetics Tech. Int'l Corp.\r\nv. Fourth Nat'l Bank</em>, 705 F.2d 396, 399 (10th Cir. 1983).  We conclude that the security interest\r\ngranted to the Landlord was not strictly limited to the property to which Zurita held legal title. \r\nRather, the security interest also covered the equipment, fixtures, furniture, inventory, and similar\r\nitems located on the leased premises that Zurita had the authority to pledge as security under\r\nsection 9.203.  This included the property to which AZR, an entity owned solely by Zurita, held legal\r\ntitle and which was located at the leased premises.  We overrule the first appellate issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Did the trial court have jurisdiction over the requests for declaratory relief?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn their second issue, Zurita and AZR contend that the trial court erred by concluding\r\nthat it lacked jurisdiction over their requests for declaratory relief and therefore refusing to address\r\nthose claims.  The record reflects that, by the time of trial, Zurita had abandoned any claim for\r\ndeclaratory relief.<sup> (2)</sup>  AZR's live pleading, however, requested a declaration that it owned the\r\nforeclosed-on property and that US Bancorp's purchase-money security interest was superior to the\r\nLandlord's lien. The trial court concluded that the Landlord lawfully repossessed and disposed\r\nof the property, thereby effectively denying AZR's request for a declaration that it owned the\r\nproperty.  With respect to AZR's request that the court declare that US Bancorp had rights in the\r\nproperty superior to the Landlord's, the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law include\r\nthe following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tFOF 42:\tBecause Zurita and [AZR] failed to join or retain other parties who\r\nmay have or claim an interest in the collateral, the court cannot make\r\nany declaration regarding their interests.  These parties include U.S.\r\nBancorp (USB), Coactive Capital Partners, LLC, American\r\nEquipment, and Tarka.  The only documentation provided from these\r\nentities showed, at most, a possible purchase money security interest\r\nin computers and related equipment, not one in restaurant furniture,\r\nfixtures, and non-computer equipment.  None of these potential lean\r\n[sic] holders sought to intervene to prove and protect any potential\r\nsecurity interest, if one existed.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tCOL 18:\tBecause Zurita and [AZR] failed to join USB or retain Tarka as\r\nparties, the court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the priority of\r\nclaims to the collateral, or the rights to possession of such collateral. \r\nWhen declaratory relief is sought, all persons who have or claim any\r\ninterest that would be affected by the declaration must be made\r\nparties.  V.T.C.A., Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code § 37.006(a).</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tCOL 19:\tIf the court did render a declaratory judgment for [AZR], it would be\r\nan impermissible advisory opinion only.  An advisory opinion decides\r\nan abstract question of law without binding the parties.  The court\r\nlacks subject matter jurisdiction to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>The trial court concluded that it could not make a declaration of the rights of an entity that was not\r\na party to the suit.  This was not error.  When declaratory relief is sought, \"all persons who have or\r\nclaim any interest that would be affected by the declaration must be made parties.\"  Tex. Civ. Prac.\r\n&amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.006(a) (West 2008).  The statute mandates joinder of persons whose\r\ninterests would be affected by the judgment.  <em>See Indian Beach Prop. Owners' Ass'n v. Linden</em>,\r\n222 S.W.3d 682, 697 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.); <em>see also</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 39\r\n(governing joinder of persons needed for just adjudication).  The purpose of this provision is to avoid\r\na multiplicity of suits, since a declaratory judgment does not prejudice the rights of a person not a\r\nparty to the proceeding.  <em>See Dahl v. Hartman</em>, 14 S.W.3d 434, 436 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th\r\nDist.] 2000, pet. denied).  AZR's failure to join USB as a party contradicted the statute's directive\r\nthat, when seeking declaratory relief, joinder of all persons with an interest that would be affected\r\nby the declaration is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR rely on <em>Brooks v. Northglen Ass'n</em>, 141 S.W.3d 158, 162 (Tex. 2004),\r\nto support their contention that the trial court's conclusion that their failure to join US Bancorp\r\ndeprived the court of jurisdiction over the request for declaratory relief was erroneous.  In <em>Brooks</em>,\r\na group of property owners sought a declaration regarding their homeowners' association's right to\r\nincrease annual assessments and impose late fees.  The homeowners' association covered six Harris\r\nCounty subdivisions, each of which was governed by a separate set of deed restrictions.  The\r\nplaintiffs included property owners from four of the six subdivisions, but none from the remaining\r\ntwo.  The supreme court concluded that the absence of <em>some</em> of the homeowners from the represented\r\nsubdivisions did not deprive the court of jurisdiction to declare the rights of <em>all</em> property owners <em>from\r\nthose subdivisions.</em>  The court then considered whether there was jurisdiction to declare the rights\r\nof property owners from the subdivisions that had <em>no</em> representative homeowners as parties to the\r\nproceeding.  The court stated:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tA declaratory judgment requires a justiciable controversy as to the rights and status\r\nof parties actually before the court for adjudication, and the declaration sought must\r\nactually resolve the controversy.  A judicial decision reached without a case or\r\ncontroversy is an advisory opinion, which is barred by the separation of powers\r\nprovision of the Texas Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 163-64 (citations omitted).  The court held that because there were no \"plaintiffs\" from the\r\ntwo remaining subdivisions, there was no person in those sections for whom rights could be declared\r\nin the declaratory judgment action.  <em>Id.</em> at 164.  Consequently, \"the trial court was without\r\njurisdiction to issue a judgment\" with respect to those subdivisions, and any opinion interpreting\r\ntheir rights would be purely advisory.  <em>Id.</em>  Applying the supreme court's reasoning in <em>Brooks</em>, the\r\ntrial court in the present case properly concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to declare the rights\r\nof US Bancorp, an entity that was not a party to the proceeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAZR further contends that, in the event the trial court lacked jurisdiction to declare\r\nUS Bancorp's rights, the proper remedy was to afford it the opportunity to join the missing party,\r\nnot to dismiss the request for lack of jurisdiction.  However, AZR had no basis for bringing\r\nUS Bancorp into the suit--any existing dispute or controversy pertaining to the priority of liens in\r\nthe property is between the Landlord and US Bancorp.  The trial court is only required to order that\r\na third party be made a party to the suit if, without its presence, \"complete relief cannot be accorded\r\n<em>among those already parties.</em>\"  Tex. R. Civ. P. 39(a) (emphasis added).  Here, the court was able to\r\nadjudicate the issues between the Landlord and Zurita without determining the rights of US Bancorp\r\nvis-à-vis the Landlord.  US Bancorp declined to intervene in the lawsuit or otherwise seek an\r\nadjudication of its rights in the collateral in this proceeding.  Moreover, AZR never sought to have\r\nUS Bancorp intervene or somehow joined in the litigation at any time prior to or during trial, and\r\nnever sought a continuance for that purpose.  <em>See id.</em> (\"If [a party] should join as plaintiff but refuses\r\nto do so, he may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.\").  We overrule\r\nthe second appellate issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Award of attorneys' fees to the Landlord</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe trial court's judgment awards the Landlord $85,000 for reasonable and necessary\r\nattorneys' fees for trial.  The judgment also awards the Landlord $20,000 in attorneys' fees in the\r\nevent of an unsuccessful appeal by Zurita or AZR to the court of appeals and an additional $10,000\r\nin the event of an unsuccessful appeal by Zurita or AZR to the Texas Supreme Court.  The judgment\r\nprovides that Zurita and AZR are jointly and severally liable to the Landlord for all attorneys' fees. \r\nThe third appellate issue raises various challenges to the attorneys' fee award.<sup> (3)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR contend that the trial court erred when it ordered AZR to pay the\r\nLandlord attorneys' fees pursuant to section 37.009 of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act\r\n(UDJA).  We review an award of attorneys' fees under the UDJA for abuse of discretion.  <em>See\r\nBocquet v. Herring</em>, 972 S.W.2d 18, 20-21 (Tex. 1998).  Appellants argue that, although the\r\nLandlord's pleadings requested an award of attorneys' fees, it did not specifically request attorneys'\r\nfees pursuant to the UDJA, and consequently the trial court's award of attorneys' fees is an abuse\r\nof discretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSection 37.009 of the UDJA provides:  \"In any proceeding under this chapter, the\r\ncourt may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as are equitable and just.\"  Tex.\r\nCiv. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (West 2008).  In a declaratory judgment action, the trial court\r\nmay award <em>either side</em> costs and reasonable attorneys' fees as are equitable and just.  <em>See Arthur M.\r\nDeck &amp; Assocs. v. Crispin</em>, 888 S.W.2d 56, 62 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, writ denied).\r\nThe question, then, is not whether the Landlord's pleadings include a specific request for attorneys'\r\nfees under the UDJA, but whether the action between AZR and the Landlord was one \"under this\r\nchapter,\" i.e., whether it was a declaratory judgment action.  It is undisputed that AZR sought\r\ndeclaratory relief against the Landlord under the UDJA.  Thus, the trial court was authorized to\r\naward attorneys' fees to any party with pleadings requesting them.  <em>See Purvis Oil Corp. v. Hillin</em>,\r\n890 S.W.2d 931, 939 (Tex. App.--El Paso 1994, no writ) (concluding that party moving for\r\nattorneys' fees in declaratory judgment action need not specify statutory authority for award so long\r\nas that party has pleaded for attorneys' fees).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR next contend that the Landlord was not entitled to an award of\r\nattorneys' fees under the UDJA because \"the trial court found it lacked jurisdiction to consider the\r\nrequest for declaratory relief.\"  AZR asserts that because there was no adjudication on the merits of\r\nthe claim, no party prevailed and an award of any attorneys' fees under those circumstances is not\r\nequitable and just.  While the requirements that fees be reasonable and necessary are matters of fact,\r\nthe requirements that fees be equitable and just are matters of law.  <em>See Bocquet</em>, 972 S.W.2d at 21. \r\nIn a declaratory judgment action, the decision to award attorneys' fees is solely within the discretion\r\nof the trial court.  <em>See Neeley v. West Orange-Cove Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 176 S.W.3d 746, 799\r\n(Tex. 2005).  Under section 37.009, a trial court may exercise its discretion to award attorneys'\r\nfees to the prevailing party, the nonprevailing party, or neither.  <em>See Barshop v. Medina Cnty.\r\nUnderground Water Conservation Dist.</em>, 925 S.W.2d 618, 637-38 (Tex. 1996) (award of attorneys'\r\nfees in declaratory judgment action is not dependent on finding that party \"substantially prevailed\"). \r\nMoreover, the statute does not require a judgment on the merits of the dispute as a prerequisite to\r\na fee award.  <em>See Castro v. McNabb</em>, 319 S.W.3d 721, 735 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2009, no pet.).  AZR\r\ninvoked the UDJA when it sought declaratory relief.  The trial court's conclusion that it lacked\r\njurisdiction to render the requested declarations did not change the nature of the proceeding. \r\nBecause this was a proceeding under the UDJA, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\r\nawarding the Landlord attorneys' fees pursuant to section 37.009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR also argue that the attorneys' fee award should be reversed because\r\nthe Landlord failed to segregate the fees incurred in connection with the UDJA claim filed by AZR \r\nfrom the fees incurred in prosecuting its affirmative claim for breach of contract against Zurita.  We\r\nunderstand Zurita and AZR's brief to complain about both (1) the Landlord's failure to segregate its\r\nfees between the UDJA claims and its claims for affirmative relief and (2) the trial court's failure\r\nto segregate the fees awarded between Zurita and AZR, instead making them jointly and severally\r\nliable for the entire fee award.  With regard to the Landlord's failure to segregate fees between\r\nthe breach-of-contract claim and the claims under the UDJA, we note that fee claimants are\r\nrequired to segregate fees incurred in connection with claims for which fees are recoverable from\r\nfees incurred in connection with claims for which they are not.  <em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>,\r\n212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006).  Segregation is required because trial courts lack the inherent\r\nauthority to require a losing party to pay the prevailing party's fees, and may only award fees if\r\nauthorized by contract or statute.  <em>Id. </em> In this case, however, the Landlord was authorized by statute\r\nto recover attorneys' fees incurred in connection with both the breach of contract claim and the\r\nUDJA claim.  Consequently, it was not required to segregate its fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tRegarding the complaint that the trial court erred by not dividing the fee award\r\nbetween Zurita and AZR, this contention is directly contradicted by, and inconsonant with, their own\r\ntrial testimony.  When presenting evidence in support of Zurita and AZR's request for their\r\nattorneys' fees, their counsel testified that:  \"[T]his is the type of case where the parties are so\r\ninextricably intertwined, that it would be virtually impossible to segregate the attorneys' fees as\r\nbetween the various parties.\"  Having testified at trial that it was impossible to segregate the fees\r\nbetween the parties, Zurita and AZR are estopped from now complaining on appeal that the trial\r\ncourt failed to do so.  <em>In re Dep't of Family &amp; Protective Servs.</em>, 273 S.W.3d 637, 646 (Tex. 2009)\r\n(party estopped from taking position on appeal clearly adverse to position it took unequivocally at\r\ntrial).  Moreover, even if this was error, it was invited by Zurita and AZR's counsel.  <em>See Tittizer\r\nv. Union Gas Corp.</em>, 171 S.W.3d 857, 862 (Tex. 2005) (party cannot complain on appeal that trial\r\ncourt took specific action that complaining party requested).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR next assert that there is insufficient evidence that the amount of\r\nattorneys' fees for which they were held jointly and severally liable is reasonable. However, during\r\nthe presentation of evidence at trial supporting the Landlord's claim for attorneys' fees, counsel for\r\nZurita and AZR stated:  \"Your Honor, I don't object to the reasonableness of [the Landlord's]\r\nattorneys' fees.\"  Consequently, appellants have also waived any complaint regarding the\r\nreasonableness of the fee award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn a final complaint about attorneys' fees, Zurita and AZR challenge the trial court's\r\njudgment awarding appellate attorneys' fees jointly and severally against them.  As written, the\r\njudgment makes both AZR and Zurita liable for the Landlord's appellate attorneys' fees even if only\r\none of them pursues the unsuccessful appeal.  This was error.  While our disposition moots the\r\ncomplaint with respect to the appellate attorneys' fees awarded to the Landlord in connection with\r\nthe appeal to this Court, we modify the judgment to reflect that the contingent award of $10,000 in\r\nattorneys' fees to the Landlord in the event of an unsuccessful appeal to the Texas Supreme Court\r\napplies only against the party or parties that actually participate in such appeal, if any.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Failure to award attorneys' fees to Zurita</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe trial court reduced its award of actual damages to the Landlord by $25,000 based\r\non its finding that the Landlord failed to properly conduct the foreclosure sale.  In their third\r\nappellate issue, Zurita and AZR contend that this reduction in the amount awarded implies that the\r\ntrial court found that the Landlord either breached the lease agreement or breached sections 9.610\r\nand 9.611 of the business and commerce code.  <em>See</em> Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. §§ 9.601, .611. \r\nAppellants assert that such an implied finding supports an award of attorneys' fees to Zurita \"based\r\non its [sic] successful breach claim and UCC violation claim.\"  Appellants fail to identify which\r\nprovision of the lease it contends the Landlord breached or explain how the Landlord's failure to\r\nconduct the foreclosure sale in compliance with the UCC constitutes breach of the lease agreement,\r\nnor did they advance any breach-of-contract claims at trial.  Moreover, appellants do not identify any\r\nstatutory provision that would entitle Zurita to an award of attorneys' fees for the Landlord's failure\r\nto conduct the foreclosure sale in compliance with Article 9.  <em>Cf. id.</em> § 9.625 (setting forth remedies\r\nfor secured party's failure to comply with chapter nine, including damages in amount of any loss\r\ncaused by such failure but not providing for award of attorneys' fees).  Assuming that the trial court\r\nmade the implied finding that Zurita and AZR rely on, such finding does not provide a basis for\r\nawarding them attorneys' fees.  With the exception of the modification to the award of appellate\r\nattorneys' fees noted above, we overrule the third appellate issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Were Zurita and AZR denied a fair trial?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn their fourth issue, Zurita and AZR assert that several of the trial court's rulings\r\nwere arbitrary and capricious and consequently, they were denied a fair trial.  Specifically, Zurita and\r\nAZR complain that the trial court's denial of two motions for continuance and its refusal to give\r\nthem additional time during trial to present more evidence, considered independently or\r\ncumulatively, constitute reversible error requiring remand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tOn January 29, 2010, Zurita and AZR filed a motion to continue the February 16,\r\n2010 trial setting.  The case had been set for a nonjury trial on that date since the trial court's entry\r\nof a scheduling order in October 2009.  As one of the grounds for the requested continuance, Zurita\r\nand AZR asserted that, due to accident and mistake, they had failed to make a timely jury demand. \r\nThey argued that the trial court should grant a continuance in order to allow them to try their case\r\nbefore a jury.  Zurita and AZR also asserted that they needed additional time to conduct discovery\r\nregarding the Landlord's alleged failure to mitigate damages.  Zurita and AZR claimed to have\r\nrecently been provided the names of individuals who presented the Landlord with letters of intent\r\nregarding the leased premises; they requested a continuance in order to conduct discovery as to those\r\nindividuals.  However, Zurita and AZR also conceded that the names were provided by the Landlord\r\nin response to interrogatories that had not been propounded until thirty-four days before the\r\nexpiration of the discovery period for a case that had been on file for over a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWe review a trial court's denial of a motion for continuance for an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  <em>BMC Software Belg., N.V.</em>, 83 S.W.3d at 800.  A trial court abuses its discretion when\r\nit reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of\r\nlaw.  <em>Id.</em>  If a continuance is sought in order to pursue further discovery, the movant must describe\r\nthe evidence sought, explain its materiality, and show that the party requesting the continuance has\r\nused due diligence to obtain the evidence.  <em>Wal-Mart Stores Tex., LP v. Crosby</em>, 295 S.W.3d 346,\r\n356 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2009, pet. denied).  The record does not affirmatively show the diligence\r\nnecessary for Zurita and AZR to have obtained a continuance to conduct additional discovery.  <em>See\r\nState v. Wood Oil Distrib.</em>, 751 S.W.2d 863, 865 (Tex. 1988) (failure of litigant to utilize rules of\r\ncivil procedure for discovery purposes will not authorize granting of continuance).  Moreover, the\r\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to continue the trial in order to permit counsel for\r\nZurita and AZR to obtain a jury trial when they failed to timely request one and did not object to the\r\nnonjury trial setting entered by the court as part of its scheduling order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAt trial, Zurita and AZR orally reurged their motion for continuance, essentially\r\narguing that the continuance was required so that they could obtain testimony from witnesses\r\nregarding the Landlord's alleged failure to mitigate damages.  Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 252\r\nprovides that if the ground for a continuance is lack of testimony, the party seeking the continuance\r\nmust provide an affidavit stating that the testimony is material, that he used due diligence to procure\r\nthe testimony, and that such testimony cannot be procured from any other source.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ.\r\nP. 252.  Rule 252 further provides that if the motion for continuance is sought due to the absence of\r\na witness, the movant must provide an affidavit stating the name and address of the witness, what\r\nhe expects the witness's testimony to prove, and that the continuance is not sought for delay but so\r\njustice may be done.  <em>See id.</em>  A trial court does not abuse its discretion when it denies a motion for\r\ncontinuance that does not meet those requirements.  <em>See Pape v. Guadalupe-Blanco River Auth.</em>,\r\n48 S.W.3d 908, 914 (Tex. App.--Austin 2001, pet. denied) (citing Tex. R. Civ. P. 252).  Zurita and\r\nAZR's oral motion for a continuance at trial did not comply with the requirements of rule 252. \r\nAccordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Zurita and\r\nAZR's motion for continuance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR also complain that the trial court erred in limiting the time they had\r\nto present their case.  On the first day of trial, the court asked the parties how much time they needed,\r\nand counsel for Zurita and AZR expressed no objection to the statement by counsel for the Landlord\r\nthat the case would take two and a half days.  At the end of the second day that the trial court heard\r\nevidence, and again at the beginning and the end of the third day on which the court heard evidence,\r\nthe trial court discussed the time limits for the parties to present their respective cases.  The trial\r\ncourt repeatedly provided the parties with a summary of the time each had used and how much time\r\nremained.  Zurita and AZR did not object or inform the court that they needed more time.  Counsel\r\nfor Zurita and AZR only complained about the time limit when there was one hour remaining of the\r\nallotted time for their evidence.  Counsel again asked for a continuance, which the trial court denied,\r\nexplaining that Zurita and AZR were aware of the time limits and had never objected to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTo preserve error for appeal, Zurita and AZR were required to make a timely, specific\r\nobjection to the time limit at the earliest possible opportunity.  <em>See Schwartz v. Forest Pharms., Inc.</em>,\r\n127 S.W.3d 118, 126-27 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied) (citing Tex. R. App.\r\nP. 33.1).  Zurita and AZR failed to object to the initial imposition of the time limit.  In addition, they\r\nsubsequently failed to object when the trial court repeatedly reminded them of the time limit and\r\nadvised them of their remaining time.  Instead, they made no objection until the court gave its final\r\nreminder on the last day of trial.  By failing to make a timely objection, they waived any complaint\r\nthat the trial court erred by imposing and enforcing the time limit.  <em>See id.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR have failed to show that the trial court's rulings, considered\r\nindividually or cumulatively, denied them a fair trial.  Having concluded that the trial court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in denying Zurita and AZR's motion for continuance and that Zurita and AZR\r\nwaived any error by the trial court in limiting the trial time to two and a half days, we overrule the\r\nfourth appellate issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t</span>We modify the trial court's judgment to reflect that the contingent award of $10,000\r\nin attorneys' fees to the Landlord in the event of an unsuccessful appeal to the Texas Supreme Court\r\nis rendered only against the party or parties that actually participate in any such appeal.  As modified,\r\nwe affirm the trial court's judgment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t_____________________________________________</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\tJ.

The Uniform Commercial Code should be construed to promote uniformity with other\r\njurisdictions.  <em>See </em>Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.

Zurita's third amended answer and verified denial, filed on January 15, 2010, does not\r\ninclude a request for declaratory judgment.  This pleading contains only a general and verified denial\r\nand sets forth as an affirmative defense that the Landlord failed to mitigate its damages.\r\n</p><p>3.   As an initial matter, Zurita and AZR state that in the event this Court sustains the second\r\nappellate issue and holds that the trial court erred in concluding that it lacked subject matter\r\njurisdiction over the request for declaratory relief, the attorneys' fee award should be reversed and\r\nthe cause remanded to allow the trial court to reassess fees.

After a bench trial, the trial court rendered\r\njudgment against Zurita on the Landlord's breach-of-contract claim and against AZR on its\r\nconversion and tortious-interference claims.  The judgment awarded the Landlord damages, pre- and\r\npost-judgment interest, and attorneys' fees, and held Zurita and AZR jointly and severally liable for \r\nthe attorneys' fee award.

In four issues, AZR and Zurita\r\ncontend that the trial court erred in (1) rendering judgment that AZR take nothing on its conversion\r\nclaim; (2) concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over Zurita's and AZR's requests for declaratory\r\nrelief; (3) holding Zurita and AZR jointly and severally liable for attorneys' fees awarded to the\r\nLandlord; and (4) making certain procedural rulings that were arbitrary and capricious and denied\r\nthem a fair trial.  We will modify the trial court's judgment and, as modified, affirm.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe Landlord owns the Sunset Valley Homestead Shopping Center located in Austin. \r\nIn March 2007, the Landlord and Zurita executed a commercial lease for approximately 3,000 square\r\nfeet of space in the shopping center.  The lease provided that \"Tenant will use the Premises to\r\noperate a restaurant whose primary business is a sandwich bar.\"  Because Zurita intended to operate\r\nthe restaurant through a separate entity that had not yet been formed, the lease included a provision\r\nsetting forth the Landlord's consent to a \"one-time\" assignment of the lease, to be executed before\r\nthe date the leased premises were deemed by the Landlord to be ready for occupancy, to an entity\r\ncreated to operate the restaurant and \"whose managing principal is Agustin Zurita.\"  After the lease\r\nwas signed, Zurita formed Z &amp; P Sunset Valley Food but failed to execute an assignment of the lease\r\nto that entity prior to the date on which the premises were ready for occupancy.  Consequently, Zurita\r\nremained the tenant on the lease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe lease also granted the Landlord a lien on certain personal property located on\r\nthe premises:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tLANDLORD SHALL HAVE AND TENANT HEREBY GRANTS TO\r\nLANDLORD A CONTINUING SECURITY INTEREST FOR ALL RENTALS\r\nAND OTHER SUMS OF MONEY DUE OR TO BECOME DUE HEREUNDER\r\nFROM TENANT, UPON ALL GOODS, WARES, EQUIPMENT, FIXTURES,\r\nFURNITURE, INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS, DOCUMENTS, GENERAL\r\nINTANGIBLES, CHATTEL PAPER, DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, DOCUMENTS,\r\nINSTRUMENTS, INVESTMENT PROPERTY AND OTHER PERSONAL\r\nPROPERTY OF TENANT NOW OWNED OR HEREAFTER ACQUIRED\r\n(COLLECTIVELY \"COLLATERAL\") AND SITUATED (OR DOCUMENTS\r\nEVIDENCING SUCH COLLATERAL KEPT) ON, AT, OR WITHIN THE\r\nPREMISES, WHICH IS LOCATED AT <strong>Sunset Valley Homestead Shopping\r\nCenter, SEC Hwy 290 and Brodie Lane, Austin, Texas.</strong> . . . THIS SECURITY\r\nAGREEMENT AND FINANCING STATEMENT ALSO COVERS FIXTURES\r\nLOCATED AT THE PREMISES DESCRIBED IN <span>EXHIBIT A</span> AND <span>EXHIBIT B</span>\r\nATTACHED HERETO, AND MAY BE FILED FOR RECORD IN THE\r\nREAL ESTATE RECORDS FOR THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE PREMISES\r\nARE LOCATED.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Exhibits A and B provided specific descriptions of the premises leased by Zurita.  Pursuant to this\r\nprovision, in the event of Zurita's default under the lease, the Landlord would have all rights and\r\nremedies of a secured creditor under the Uniform Commercial Code, including the right to sell the\r\nproperty subject to the security interest granted by Zurita.  <em>See</em> Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann.\r\n§§ 9.101-.709 (West 2011).  When Zurita signed the lease granting the security interest, the leased\r\npremises were unfinished, and no equipment, fixtures, furniture, or other items were located there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAt trial, Zurita testified that after the premises were ready for occupancy, AZR\r\npurchased the restaurant equipment and furnishings.  In connection with this purchase, AZR entered\r\ninto financing agreements with US Bancorp.  AZR is a limited liability company formed in 2006 and\r\nowned solely by Zurita.  According to Zurita, AZR had legal title to the equipment and furnishings\r\nlocated in the leased premises, and US Bancorp had a purchase money security interest in the\r\nfinanced items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe ten-year lease term commenced in September 2007.  In January 2008 Zurita\r\nbegan defaulting on rent payments.  In June 2008 Zurita sent a letter to the Landlord informing it that\r\nhe had decided to close the restaurant.  The next day, the Landlord sent Zurita a letter informing him\r\nthat, due to his default in paying rent, and because he had given notice that he was vacating the\r\nleased premises, it was exercising its right to terminate Zurita's right to possession of the premises. \r\nThereafter, the Landlord informed Zurita in writing that, if he failed to pay the balance due for\r\nunpaid rent, it intended to proceed with disposition of the contents of the leased premises, claiming\r\na security interest in that property pursuant to the terms of the lease.  Through his counsel, Zurita\r\nrequested that no action be taken until counsel had an opportunity to investigate the facts and\r\nexpressed a particular concern that the items the Landlord claimed a security interest in were subject\r\nto a subordination agreement in favor of US Bancorp.  During the parties' subsequent settlement\r\nnegotiations, which failed, counsel for Zurita learned that there was no subordination agreement\r\ncovering the contents of the leased premises.  The Landlord gave notice of a November 13, 2008\r\npublic sale and disposition of collateral, including all non-affixed contents of the leased premises. \r\nThe letter also stated that \"[a]ll fixtures have reverted to the Landlord in accordance with the law.\" \r\nAt the sale, one of Zurita's business associates bid $50,000 for the property, but later withdrew the\r\nbid.  Consequently, the Landlord's opening bid of $25,000 was the winning bid.  The Landlord\r\ncredited the $25,000 against Zurita's debt to it under the lease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe Landlord filed its original petition against Zurita on October 17, 2008 alleging\r\nbreach of the lease and seeking damages for past-due rent payment, various expenses, late fees, and\r\nother charges.  Zurita filed a general denial and requested a declaration that US Bancorp had a lien\r\non personal property that was superior to the Landlord's.  Zurita also filed counterclaims for: \r\n(1) conversion, based on his assertion that AZR held legal title to the property, and consequently the\r\nsecurity interest granted to the Landlord by Zurita had not attached to the property sold; (2) tortious\r\ninterference with a contractual relationship between US Bancorp and AZR; (3) violation of a right\r\nto redeem, based on the Landlord's alleged refusal to accept Zurita's offer to pay his debt to the\r\nLandlord, including attorneys' fees; and (4) common law fraud, based on allegedly false\r\nrepresentations Zurita claimed the Landlord made in connection with Zurita's attempts to redeem\r\nthe property.  Zurita later added a counterclaim for \"failure to mitigate.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn April 2009 AZR filed a plea in intervention seeking a declaration that it had legal\r\ntitle to the property sold and that the Landlord had no valid lien on that property.  AZR also asserted\r\ncauses of action for:  (1) conversion, based on the Landlord's allegedly unlawful foreclosure and sale\r\nof the property at public auction; and (2) tortious interference with a contractual relationship between\r\nAZR and US Bancorp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe trial court subsequently granted the Landlord's motion for summary judgment\r\non Zurita's liability for breach of the lease.  The court also ordered that the Landlord recover from\r\nZurita its damages and attorneys' fees in amounts to be determined by the factfinder.  In his third\r\namended answer, Zurita dropped his request for declaratory relief and all previously asserted\r\ncounterclaims.  This amended answer contained only Zurita's general denial, an affirmative defense\r\nthat the Landlord failed to mitigate its damages, and a request for attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAfter a bench trial, the trial court awarded the Landlord $284,838.80 against Zurita\r\non the breach-of-contract claim.  The court rendered judgment against AZR on its conversion and\r\ntortious interference claims.  The court denied the Landlord's claim for reverse veil-piercing against\r\nZurita and AZR.  The court reduced the amount of actual damages awarded to the Landlord for\r\nZurita's breach of the lease agreement by $25,000 due to its conclusion that the Landlord failed to\r\nproperly conduct a foreclosure under Uniform Commercial Code article 9 but also found that the\r\nforeclosure sale did serve to pass title to the property despite the defect.  The order also held Zurita\r\nand AZR jointly and severally liable for $85,000 in attorneys' fees awarded to the Landlord. \r\nAfter rendering judgment, the trial court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  This\r\nappeal followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong></strong><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn their first issue, Zurita and AZR challenge the trial court's judgment against AZR\r\non its conversion claim.  They assert that the record conclusively demonstrates that AZR, not Zurita,\r\nhad legal title to the property the Landlord foreclosed on and sold at public auction, that Zurita could\r\nnot have granted the Landlord a security interest in the property the Landlord sold, and that the\r\nLandlord's disposition of AZR's property was therefore wrongful.  As demonstrated by the findings\r\nof fact and conclusions of law detailed below, the trial court determined that the Landlord's\r\nforeclosure and sale of the property was not wrongful, and therefore did not constitute conversion,\r\nbecause Zurita could and did grant to the Landlord a security interest in the property located within\r\nthe leased premises to secure payment for rent and other sums due under the lease:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tFOF 9:\tZurita granted a continuing security interest in all of the personal\r\nproperty situated on, at, or within the premises to [the Landlord] to\r\nsecure payment for rent and other sums due under the lease.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tFOF 10:\tOn October 30, 2007, [the Landlord] filed a UCC Financing\r\nStatement with the Texas Secretary of State.

App.--Dallas 2008, no pet.). \r\nThe parties here do not dispute that AZR had legal title to the property or that the Landlord exercised\r\ndominion or control over it.  The dispute is whether the Landlord's conduct was wrongful.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Was the Landlord's disposition of the property wrongful?</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe Landlord asserted, and the trial court agreed, that its disposition of the property\r\nwas lawful because it was exercising its rights as a secured creditor with a perfected security interest\r\nin the property.  Zurita and AZR, on the other hand, contend that the Landlord did not have a valid\r\nsecurity interest in the property because (1) Zurita had no power to grant the Landlord a security\r\ninterest in property owned by AZR, and (2) by its terms, the granting language limited the security\r\ninterest to property <em>owned by Zurita</em>.  The security agreement plainly granted the Landlord a security\r\ninterest in property \"owned or hereafter acquired\" by Zurita, and located in the leased premises. \r\nZurita and AZR assert that the security interest therefore attached only to property to which Zurita\r\nheld or acquired legal title.  We disagree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tFor a security interest to attach to the collateral, the debtor must have \"rights in the\r\ncollateral <em>or the power to transfer rights in the collateral to the secured party</em>.\"  Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.\r\nCode Ann. § 9.203(b)(2) (emphasis added).  As a general rule, a security interest attaches only to\r\nwhatever rights the debtor may have in the collateral, broad or limited as those rights may be. \r\nHowever, comment 6 to section 9-203 observes that the italicized phrase accommodates exceptions\r\nto the general rule that \"enable a debtor to transfer, and a security interest to attach to, greater rights\r\nthan the debtor has.\"  <em>Id.</em> cmt. 6.  Such an exception exists here.  It is undisputed that Zurita is the\r\nsole owner of AZR.  Consequently, he had the power to transfer rights in property to which his\r\ncompany, AZR, held legal title.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWith respect to AZR and Zurita's contention that the language of the Landlord's lien\r\nitself does not cover property to which Zurita does not have legal title, we note that the provision\r\npurports to grant a security interest in property Zurita \"owned or hereafter acquired.\"  We do not\r\nagree that this granting language limits the collateral subject to the security interest to only those\r\nitems to which Zurita had legal title.  The Uniform Commercial Code does not equate a debtor's\r\nrights in collateral with its possession of legal title.  <em>See In re Whatley</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"523161\"><a href=\"/opinion/523161/in-the-matter-of-john-w-whatley-and-ruby-l-whatley-whatley-farms-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></a></span>, 1004 (5th Cir.\r\n1989) (holding bankruptcy court erred in equating debtor's rights in collateral with its possession\r\nof legal title and observing that \"[t]he Uniform Commercial Code does not equate the two concepts;\r\nthey are not the same\").  A debtor need not have legal title to equipment in order to grant a creditor\r\na security interest.  <em>Id.</em> (citing <em>Matter of Samuels &amp; Co., Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></span> (5th Cir. 1987)\r\n(en banc)). While the Uniform Commercial Code does not define the term \"rights in the collateral,\"\r\nit is generally recognized that legal title is not required and that rights in the collateral may be\r\nsufficient if the true owner consents to the debtor's use of the collateral as security, or if the true\r\nowner is estopped from denying the creation of the security interest because he has allowed another\r\nto appear as the owner, or as having full power of disposition over the property, so that an innocent\r\nperson is led into dealing with such apparent owner.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>In re Pubs, Inc. of Champaign</em>,\r\n618 F.2d 432, 437-38 (7th Cir. 1980) (applying Illinois law).<sup> (1)</sup>  Although we have found no Texas\r\ncases directly on point, \"all of the courts that have considered the question have ruled that an owner's\r\npermission to use goods as collateral creates rights in the debtor sufficient to give rise to an\r\nenforceable security interest.\"  <em>In re WL Homes, LLC</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2187146\"><a href=\"/opinion/2187146/in-re-wl-homes-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 142 (Bankr.

Mich. Apr. 7, 2008).  Here, the\r\nlandlord's lien specifically identifies that it attaches to \"all goods, wares, equipment fixtures,\r\nfurniture, inventory, accounts, documents, instruments, investment property, and other personal\r\nproperty\" that Zurita owns or hereafter acquires and that are located at the leased premises.  Because\r\nthe UCC does not equate ownership rights sufficient to convey a security interest with legal title,\r\nZurita had sufficient rights in the collateral to \"own\" it for purposes of granting a security interest,\r\nand the description of the collateral contained in the lease provision purports to grant to the Landlord\r\na security interest in all such property.  This conclusion is consistent with the purposes and goals of\r\nthe Uniform Commercial Code, which was designed, in part, \"to prevent hidden-title subterfuge in\r\nwhich the true owner of collateral, by permitting another party to exercise an outward appearance\r\nof ownership, could deceive third-party creditors to their detriment.\"  <em>Kinetics Tech.

We conclude that the security interest\r\ngranted to the Landlord was not strictly limited to the property to which Zurita held legal title. \r\nRather, the security interest also covered the equipment, fixtures, furniture, inventory, and similar\r\nitems located on the leased premises that Zurita had the authority to pledge as security under\r\nsection 9.203.  This included the property to which AZR, an entity owned solely by Zurita, held legal\r\ntitle and which was located at the leased premises.  We overrule the first appellate issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Did the trial court have jurisdiction over the requests for declaratory relief?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn their second issue, Zurita and AZR contend that the trial court erred by concluding\r\nthat it lacked jurisdiction over their requests for declaratory relief and therefore refusing to address\r\nthose claims.  The record reflects that, by the time of trial, Zurita had abandoned any claim for\r\ndeclaratory relief.<sup> (2)</sup>  AZR's live pleading, however, requested a declaration that it owned the\r\nforeclosed-on property and that US Bancorp's purchase-money security interest was superior to the\r\nLandlord's lien. The trial court concluded that the Landlord lawfully repossessed and disposed\r\nof the property, thereby effectively denying AZR's request for a declaration that it owned the\r\nproperty.  With respect to AZR's request that the court declare that US Bancorp had rights in the\r\nproperty superior to the Landlord's, the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law include\r\nthe following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tFOF 42:\tBecause Zurita and [AZR] failed to join or retain other parties who\r\nmay have or claim an interest in the collateral, the court cannot make\r\nany declaration regarding their interests.  These parties include U.S.\r\nBancorp (USB), Coactive Capital Partners, LLC, American\r\nEquipment, and Tarka.  The only documentation provided from these\r\nentities showed, at most, a possible purchase money security interest\r\nin computers and related equipment, not one in restaurant furniture,\r\nfixtures, and non-computer equipment.  None of these potential lean\r\n[sic] holders sought to intervene to prove and protect any potential\r\nsecurity interest, if one existed.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tCOL 18:\tBecause Zurita and [AZR] failed to join USB or retain Tarka as\r\nparties, the court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the priority of\r\nclaims to the collateral, or the rights to possession of such collateral. \r\nWhen declaratory relief is sought, all persons who have or claim any\r\ninterest that would be affected by the declaration must be made\r\nparties.  V.T.C.A., Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code § 37.006(a).</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tCOL 19:\tIf the court did render a declaratory judgment for [AZR], it would be\r\nan impermissible advisory opinion only.  An advisory opinion decides\r\nan abstract question of law without binding the parties.  The court\r\nlacks subject matter jurisdiction to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>The trial court concluded that it could not make a declaration of the rights of an entity that was not\r\na party to the suit.  This was not error.  When declaratory relief is sought, \"all persons who have or\r\nclaim any interest that would be affected by the declaration must be made parties.\"  Tex. Civ. Prac.\r\n&amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.006(a) (West 2008).  The statute mandates joinder of persons whose\r\ninterests would be affected by the judgment.  <em>See Indian Beach Prop. Owners' Ass'n v. Linden</em>,\r\n222 S.W.3d 682, 697 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.); <em>see also</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 39\r\n(governing joinder of persons needed for just adjudication).  The purpose of this provision is to avoid\r\na multiplicity of suits, since a declaratory judgment does not prejudice the rights of a person not a\r\nparty to the proceeding.  <em>See Dahl v. Hartman</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1676552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1676552/dahl-v-hartman/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 436 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th\r\nDist.] 2000, pet. denied).  AZR's failure to join USB as a party contradicted the statute's directive\r\nthat, when seeking declaratory relief, joinder of all persons with an interest that would be affected\r\nby the declaration is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR rely on <em>Brooks v. Northglen Ass'n</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894539\"><a href=\"/opinion/894539/brooks-v-northglen-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span>, 162 (Tex. 2004),\r\nto support their contention that the trial court's conclusion that their failure to join US Bancorp\r\ndeprived the court of jurisdiction over the request for declaratory relief was erroneous.  In <em>Brooks</em>,\r\na group of property owners sought a declaration regarding their homeowners' association's right to\r\nincrease annual assessments and impose late fees.  The homeowners' association covered six Harris\r\nCounty subdivisions, each of which was governed by a separate set of deed restrictions.  The\r\nplaintiffs included property owners from four of the six subdivisions, but none from the remaining\r\ntwo.  The supreme court concluded that the absence of <em>some</em> of the homeowners from the represented\r\nsubdivisions did not deprive the court of jurisdiction to declare the rights of <em>all</em> property owners <em>from\r\nthose subdivisions.</em>  The court then considered whether there was jurisdiction to declare the rights\r\nof property owners from the subdivisions that had <em>no</em> representative homeowners as parties to the\r\nproceeding.  The court stated:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tA declaratory judgment requires a justiciable controversy as to the rights and status\r\nof parties actually before the court for adjudication, and the declaration sought must\r\nactually resolve the controversy.  A judicial decision reached without a case or\r\ncontroversy is an advisory opinion, which is barred by the separation of powers\r\nprovision of the Texas Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 163-64 (citations omitted).  The court held that because there were no \"plaintiffs\" from the\r\ntwo remaining subdivisions, there was no person in those sections for whom rights could be declared\r\nin the declaratory judgment action.  <em>Id.</em> at 164.  Consequently, \"the trial court was without\r\njurisdiction to issue a judgment\" with respect to those subdivisions, and any opinion interpreting\r\ntheir rights would be purely advisory.  <em>Id.</em>  Applying the supreme court's reasoning in <em>Brooks</em>, the\r\ntrial court in the present case properly concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to declare the rights\r\nof US Bancorp, an entity that was not a party to the proceeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAZR further contends that, in the event the trial court lacked jurisdiction to declare\r\nUS Bancorp's rights, the proper remedy was to afford it the opportunity to join the missing party,\r\nnot to dismiss the request for lack of jurisdiction.  However, AZR had no basis for bringing\r\nUS Bancorp into the suit--any existing dispute or controversy pertaining to the priority of liens in\r\nthe property is between the Landlord and US Bancorp.  The trial court is only required to order that\r\na third party be made a party to the suit if, without its presence, \"complete relief cannot be accorded\r\n<em>among those already parties.</em>\"  Tex. R. Civ. P. 39(a) (emphasis added).  Here, the court was able to\r\nadjudicate the issues between the Landlord and Zurita without determining the rights of US Bancorp\r\nvis-à-vis the Landlord.  US Bancorp declined to intervene in the lawsuit or otherwise seek an\r\nadjudication of its rights in the collateral in this proceeding.  Moreover, AZR never sought to have\r\nUS Bancorp intervene or somehow joined in the litigation at any time prior to or during trial, and\r\nnever sought a continuance for that purpose.  <em>See id.</em> (\"If [a party] should join as plaintiff but refuses\r\nto do so, he may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.\").  We overrule\r\nthe second appellate issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Award of attorneys' fees to the Landlord</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe trial court's judgment awards the Landlord $85,000 for reasonable and necessary\r\nattorneys' fees for trial.  The judgment also awards the Landlord $20,000 in attorneys' fees in the\r\nevent of an unsuccessful appeal by Zurita or AZR to the court of appeals and an additional $10,000\r\nin the event of an unsuccessful appeal by Zurita or AZR to the Texas Supreme Court.  The judgment\r\nprovides that Zurita and AZR are jointly and severally liable to the Landlord for all attorneys' fees. \r\nThe third appellate issue raises various challenges to the attorneys' fee award.<sup> (3)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR contend that the trial court erred when it ordered AZR to pay the\r\nLandlord attorneys' fees pursuant to section 37.009 of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act\r\n(UDJA).  We review an award of attorneys' fees under the UDJA for abuse of discretion.  <em>See\r\nBocquet v. Herring</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></span>, 20-21 (Tex. 1998).  Appellants argue that, although the\r\nLandlord's pleadings requested an award of attorneys' fees, it did not specifically request attorneys'\r\nfees pursuant to the UDJA, and consequently the trial court's award of attorneys' fees is an abuse\r\nof discretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSection 37.009 of the UDJA provides:  \"In any proceeding under this chapter, the\r\ncourt may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as are equitable and just.\"  Tex.\r\nCiv. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (West 2008).  In a declaratory judgment action, the trial court\r\nmay award <em>either side</em> costs and reasonable attorneys' fees as are equitable and just.  <em>See Arthur M.\r\nDeck &amp; Assocs. v. Crispin</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1494056\"><a href=\"/opinion/1494056/arthur-m-deck-associates-v-crispin/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 62 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, writ denied).\r\nThe question, then, is not whether the Landlord's pleadings include a specific request for attorneys'\r\nfees under the UDJA, but whether the action between AZR and the Landlord was one \"under this\r\nchapter,\" i.e., whether it was a declaratory judgment action.  It is undisputed that AZR sought\r\ndeclaratory relief against the Landlord under the UDJA.  Thus, the trial court was authorized to\r\naward attorneys' fees to any party with pleadings requesting them.  <em>See Purvis Oil Corp. v. Hillin</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2395060\"><a href=\"/opinion/2395060/purvis-oil-corp-v-hillin/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span>, 939 (Tex. App.--El Paso 1994, no writ) (concluding that party moving for\r\nattorneys' fees in declaratory judgment action need not specify statutory authority for award so long\r\nas that party has pleaded for attorneys' fees).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR next contend that the Landlord was not entitled to an award of\r\nattorneys' fees under the UDJA because \"the trial court found it lacked jurisdiction to consider the\r\nrequest for declaratory relief.\"  AZR asserts that because there was no adjudication on the merits of\r\nthe claim, no party prevailed and an award of any attorneys' fees under those circumstances is not\r\nequitable and just.  While the requirements that fees be reasonable and necessary are matters of fact,\r\nthe requirements that fees be equitable and just are matters of law.  <em>See Bocquet</em>, 972 S.W.2d at 21. \r\nIn a declaratory judgment action, the decision to award attorneys' fees is solely within the discretion\r\nof the trial court.  <em>See Neeley v. West Orange-Cove Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894693\"><a href=\"/opinion/894693/neeley-v-west-orange-cove/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span>, 799\r\n(Tex. 2005).  Under section 37.009, a trial court may exercise its discretion to award attorneys'\r\nfees to the prevailing party, the nonprevailing party, or neither.  <em>See Barshop v. Medina Cnty.\r\nUnderground Water Conservation Dist.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1768046\"><a href=\"/opinion/1768046/barshop-v-medina-under-wat-cons-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span>, 637-38 (Tex. 1996) (award of attorneys'\r\nfees in declaratory judgment action is not dependent on finding that party \"substantially prevailed\"). \r\nMoreover, the statute does not require a judgment on the merits of the dispute as a prerequisite to\r\na fee award.  <em>See Castro v. McNabb</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2292865\"><a href=\"/opinion/2292865/castro-v-mcnabb/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span>, 735 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2009, no pet.).  AZR\r\ninvoked the UDJA when it sought declaratory relief.  The trial court's conclusion that it lacked\r\njurisdiction to render the requested declarations did not change the nature of the proceeding. \r\nBecause this was a proceeding under the UDJA, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\r\nawarding the Landlord attorneys' fees pursuant to section 37.009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR also argue that the attorneys' fee award should be reversed because\r\nthe Landlord failed to segregate the fees incurred in connection with the UDJA claim filed by AZR \r\nfrom the fees incurred in prosecuting its affirmative claim for breach of contract against Zurita.  We\r\nunderstand Zurita and AZR's brief to complain about both (1) the Landlord's failure to segregate its\r\nfees between the UDJA claims and its claims for affirmative relief and (2) the trial court's failure\r\nto segregate the fees awarded between Zurita and AZR, instead making them jointly and severally\r\nliable for the entire fee award.  With regard to the Landlord's failure to segregate fees between\r\nthe breach-of-contract claim and the claims under the UDJA, we note that fee claimants are\r\nrequired to segregate fees incurred in connection with claims for which fees are recoverable from\r\nfees incurred in connection with claims for which they are not.  <em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>,\r\n212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006).  Segregation is required because trial courts lack the inherent\r\nauthority to require a losing party to pay the prevailing party's fees, and may only award fees if\r\nauthorized by contract or statute.  <em>Id. </em> In this case, however, the Landlord was authorized by statute\r\nto recover attorneys' fees incurred in connection with both the breach of contract claim and the\r\nUDJA claim.  Consequently, it was not required to segregate its fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tRegarding the complaint that the trial court erred by not dividing the fee award\r\nbetween Zurita and AZR, this contention is directly contradicted by, and inconsonant with, their own\r\ntrial testimony.  When presenting evidence in support of Zurita and AZR's request for their\r\nattorneys' fees, their counsel testified that:  \"[T]his is the type of case where the parties are so\r\ninextricably intertwined, that it would be virtually impossible to segregate the attorneys' fees as\r\nbetween the various parties.\"  Having testified at trial that it was impossible to segregate the fees\r\nbetween the parties, Zurita and AZR are estopped from now complaining on appeal that the trial\r\ncourt failed to do so.  <em>In re Dep't of Family &amp; Protective Servs.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895080\"><a href=\"/opinion/895080/in-re-dept-of-family-protective-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 646 (Tex. 2009)\r\n(party estopped from taking position on appeal clearly adverse to position it took unequivocally at\r\ntrial).  Moreover, even if this was error, it was invited by Zurita and AZR's counsel.  <em>See Tittizer\r\nv. Union Gas Corp.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1560763\"><a href=\"/opinion/1560763/tittizer-v-union-gas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span>, 862 (Tex. 2005) (party cannot complain on appeal that trial\r\ncourt took specific action that complaining party requested).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR next assert that there is insufficient evidence that the amount of\r\nattorneys' fees for which they were held jointly and severally liable is reasonable. However, during\r\nthe presentation of evidence at trial supporting the Landlord's claim for attorneys' fees, counsel for\r\nZurita and AZR stated:  \"Your Honor, I don't object to the reasonableness of [the Landlord's]\r\nattorneys' fees.\"  Consequently, appellants have also waived any complaint regarding the\r\nreasonableness of the fee award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn a final complaint about attorneys' fees, Zurita and AZR challenge the trial court's\r\njudgment awarding appellate attorneys' fees jointly and severally against them.  As written, the\r\njudgment makes both AZR and Zurita liable for the Landlord's appellate attorneys' fees even if only\r\none of them pursues the unsuccessful appeal.  This was error.  While our disposition moots the\r\ncomplaint with respect to the appellate attorneys' fees awarded to the Landlord in connection with\r\nthe appeal to this Court, we modify the judgment to reflect that the contingent award of $10,000 in\r\nattorneys' fees to the Landlord in the event of an unsuccessful appeal to the Texas Supreme Court\r\napplies only against the party or parties that actually participate in such appeal, if any.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Failure to award attorneys' fees to Zurita</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe trial court reduced its award of actual damages to the Landlord by $25,000 based\r\non its finding that the Landlord failed to properly conduct the foreclosure sale.  In their third\r\nappellate issue, Zurita and AZR contend that this reduction in the amount awarded implies that the\r\ntrial court found that the Landlord either breached the lease agreement or breached sections 9.610\r\nand 9.611 of the business and commerce code.  <em>See</em> Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. §§ 9.601, .611. \r\nAppellants assert that such an implied finding supports an award of attorneys' fees to Zurita \"based\r\non its [sic] successful breach claim and UCC violation claim.\"  Appellants fail to identify which\r\nprovision of the lease it contends the Landlord breached or explain how the Landlord's failure to\r\nconduct the foreclosure sale in compliance with the UCC constitutes breach of the lease agreement,\r\nnor did they advance any breach-of-contract claims at trial.  Moreover, appellants do not identify any\r\nstatutory provision that would entitle Zurita to an award of attorneys' fees for the Landlord's failure\r\nto conduct the foreclosure sale in compliance with Article 9.  <em>Cf. id.</em> § 9.625 (setting forth remedies\r\nfor secured party's failure to comply with chapter nine, including damages in amount of any loss\r\ncaused by such failure but not providing for award of attorneys' fees).  Assuming that the trial court\r\nmade the implied finding that Zurita and AZR rely on, such finding does not provide a basis for\r\nawarding them attorneys' fees.  With the exception of the modification to the award of appellate\r\nattorneys' fees noted above, we overrule the third appellate issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Were Zurita and AZR denied a fair trial?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn their fourth issue, Zurita and AZR assert that several of the trial court's rulings\r\nwere arbitrary and capricious and consequently, they were denied a fair trial.  Specifically, Zurita and\r\nAZR complain that the trial court's denial of two motions for continuance and its refusal to give\r\nthem additional time during trial to present more evidence, considered independently or\r\ncumulatively, constitute reversible error requiring remand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tOn January 29, 2010, Zurita and AZR filed a motion to continue the February 16,\r\n2010 trial setting.  The case had been set for a nonjury trial on that date since the trial court's entry\r\nof a scheduling order in October 2009.  As one of the grounds for the requested continuance, Zurita\r\nand AZR asserted that, due to accident and mistake, they had failed to make a timely jury demand. \r\nThey argued that the trial court should grant a continuance in order to allow them to try their case\r\nbefore a jury.  Zurita and AZR also asserted that they needed additional time to conduct discovery\r\nregarding the Landlord's alleged failure to mitigate damages.  Zurita and AZR claimed to have\r\nrecently been provided the names of individuals who presented the Landlord with letters of intent\r\nregarding the leased premises; they requested a continuance in order to conduct discovery as to those\r\nindividuals.  However, Zurita and AZR also conceded that the names were provided by the Landlord\r\nin response to interrogatories that had not been propounded until thirty-four days before the\r\nexpiration of the discovery period for a case that had been on file for over a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWe review a trial court's denial of a motion for continuance for an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  <em>BMC Software Belg., N.V.</em>, 83 S.W.3d at 800.  A trial court abuses its discretion when\r\nit reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of\r\nlaw.  <em>Id.</em>  If a continuance is sought in order to pursue further discovery, the movant must describe\r\nthe evidence sought, explain its materiality, and show that the party requesting the continuance has\r\nused due diligence to obtain the evidence.  <em>Wal-Mart Stores Tex., LP v. Crosby</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></span>,\r\n356 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2009, pet. denied).  The record does not affirmatively show the diligence\r\nnecessary for Zurita and AZR to have obtained a continuance to conduct additional discovery.  <em>See\r\nState v. Wood Oil Distrib.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518075\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518075/state-v-wood-oil-distributing-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></a></span>, 865 (Tex. 1988) (failure of litigant to utilize rules of\r\ncivil procedure for discovery purposes will not authorize granting of continuance).  Moreover, the\r\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to continue the trial in order to permit counsel for\r\nZurita and AZR to obtain a jury trial when they failed to timely request one and did not object to the\r\nnonjury trial setting entered by the court as part of its scheduling order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAt trial, Zurita and AZR orally reurged their motion for continuance, essentially\r\narguing that the continuance was required so that they could obtain testimony from witnesses\r\nregarding the Landlord's alleged failure to mitigate damages.  Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 252\r\nprovides that if the ground for a continuance is lack of testimony, the party seeking the continuance\r\nmust provide an affidavit stating that the testimony is material, that he used due diligence to procure\r\nthe testimony, and that such testimony cannot be procured from any other source.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ.\r\nP. 252.  Rule 252 further provides that if the motion for continuance is sought due to the absence of\r\na witness, the movant must provide an affidavit stating the name and address of the witness, what\r\nhe expects the witness's testimony to prove, and that the continuance is not sought for delay but so\r\njustice may be done.  <em>See id.</em>  A trial court does not abuse its discretion when it denies a motion for\r\ncontinuance that does not meet those requirements.  <em>See Pape v. Guadalupe-Blanco River Auth.</em>,\r\n48 S.W.3d 908, 914 (Tex. App.--Austin 2001, pet. denied) (citing Tex. R. Civ. P. 252).  Zurita and\r\nAZR's oral motion for a continuance at trial did not comply with the requirements of rule 252. \r\nAccordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Zurita and\r\nAZR's motion for continuance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR also complain that the trial court erred in limiting the time they had\r\nto present their case.  On the first day of trial, the court asked the parties how much time they needed,\r\nand counsel for Zurita and AZR expressed no objection to the statement by counsel for the Landlord\r\nthat the case would take two and a half days.  At the end of the second day that the trial court heard\r\nevidence, and again at the beginning and the end of the third day on which the court heard evidence,\r\nthe trial court discussed the time limits for the parties to present their respective cases.  The trial\r\ncourt repeatedly provided the parties with a summary of the time each had used and how much time\r\nremained.  Zurita and AZR did not object or inform the court that they needed more time.  Counsel\r\nfor Zurita and AZR only complained about the time limit when there was one hour remaining of the\r\nallotted time for their evidence.  Counsel again asked for a continuance, which the trial court denied,\r\nexplaining that Zurita and AZR were aware of the time limits and had never objected to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTo preserve error for appeal, Zurita and AZR were required to make a timely, specific\r\nobjection to the time limit at the earliest possible opportunity.  <em>See Schwartz v. Forest Pharms., Inc.</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1652260\"><a href=\"/opinion/1652260/schwartz-v-forest-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 126-27 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied) (citing Tex. R. App.\r\nP. 33.1).  Zurita and AZR failed to object to the initial imposition of the time limit.  In addition, they\r\nsubsequently failed to object when the trial court repeatedly reminded them of the time limit and\r\nadvised them of their remaining time.  Instead, they made no objection until the court gave its final\r\nreminder on the last day of trial.  By failing to make a timely objection, they waived any complaint\r\nthat the trial court erred by imposing and enforcing the time limit.  <em>See id.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tZurita and AZR have failed to show that the trial court's rulings, considered\r\nindividually or cumulatively, denied them a fair trial.  Having concluded that the trial court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in denying Zurita and AZR's motion for continuance and that Zurita and AZR\r\nwaived any error by the trial court in limiting the trial time to two and a half days, we overrule the\r\nfourth appellate issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t</span>We modify the trial court's judgment to reflect that the contingent award of $10,000\r\nin attorneys' fees to the Landlord in the event of an unsuccessful appeal to the Texas Supreme Court\r\nis rendered only against the party or parties that actually participate in any such appeal.

As an initial matter, Zurita and AZR state that in the event this Court sustains the second\r\nappellate issue and holds that the trial court erred in concluding that it lacked subject matter\r\njurisdiction over the request for declaratory relief, the attorneys' fee award should be reversed and\r\nthe cause remanded to allow the trial court to reassess fees.
