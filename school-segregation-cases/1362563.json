The military judge found\nthe appellant not guilty of raping the same child. The adjudged and approved sentence\nwas a dishonorable discharge, confinement for 6 years, total forfeitures, and reduction to\nE-1.\n\f        Before us, the appellant argues (1) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient\nto support his conviction; (2) the staff judge advocate’s recommendation and the personal\ndata sheet both fail to reflect the 182 days the appellant was in pretrial confinement,\nrequiring a new convening authority action; and (3) he is entitled to additional pretrial\nconfinement credit because he was confined with foreign nationals.1 We disagree and\naffirm.\n\n                                                     Background\n\n       In October 2012, an 11-year-old child showed a school counselor a journal entry\nshe had written about her life. The counselor could see a crossed out entry that referred\nto the child being abused. When she asked the child about it, the child started crying\nhysterically and became non-communicative. At the counselor’s suggestion, the child\nwrote more details about the abuse.\n\n      After school authorities alerted the child’s father about the allegations, he asked\nhis daughter what had happened. She told him the appellant had taken her into a\nbedroom, had her lie on the bed, and put a towel over her face. He was unable to get any\nmore details from her.\n\n       When the child’s father next saw the appellant, he informed the appellant of the\nchild’s allegations. The appellant turned pale and denied raping her. He explained the\nincident by claiming he had twice placed medication on the child because she had a\nvaginal yeast infection and also added, “Now I get to spend the rest of my life in jail.”\nThe appellant contacted his first sergeant to say he thought he would soon be arrested for\nchild molestation and admitted he had applied cream to the child’s vagina. He made a\nsimilar statement to a friend.\n\n        At trial, the child testified that on two occasions the appellant brought her into his\nroom, made her disrobe and lie on the bed with her legs hanging off the edge, put a towel\nover her head, spread her legs, and rubbed a liquid on her vagina. After the liquid was\nput on her vagina, she felt a sharp pain that lasted for a few minutes and then stopped.\nShe also testified that the appellant told her to “relax” and that the pain would go away\nafter a few minutes. The appellant also told her not to tell anyone about this.\n\n       The child’s mother testified to deny the appellant’s claim she had asked him to\napply the cream on her daughter. She also described an incident where the child was\ncrying hysterically and said the appellant had her lie on his bed naked. When confronted\nby the child’s mother, the appellant said he had been helping the child with her hygiene.\n\n\n\n1\n    This issue is raised pursuant to United States v. Grostefon, 12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A. 1982).\n\n\n                                                            2                                 ACM 38386\n\f       The appellant testified and admitted applying cream to the child’s vagina but said\nhe had done so for her own benefit and not for sexual gratification. According to the\nappellant, on two occasions after the child had wet her pants, he told her to take a bath to\nclean herself. At the conclusion of the bath, as he assisted her out of the tub, he saw that\nher vaginal lips were red and swollen, and thus he chose to apply the cream. He\ncorroborated the child’s testimony that she was naked, on her back, and with a towel on\nher head when the incident occurred. He denied spreading her legs as she claimed,\ninstead testifying that she did so herself.\n\n        He further testified that the liquid he applied was from a tube that had the word\n“rash” on it. He explained that the tube was in a drawer that contained several tubes of\nvarious ointments and creams and that he grabbed the one he thought would work best.\nThe appellant testified that he had never before or since applied cream to the child, and\nthat although the child’s mother had not specifically asked him to do so, he thought it was\nthe best thing to do.\n\n                              Legal and Factual Sufficiency\n\n       We review issues of factual and legal sufficiency de novo. United States v.\nWashington, 57 M.J. 394, 399 (C.A.A.F. 2002). The test for factual sufficiency is\n“whether, after weighing the evidence in the record of trial and making allowances for\nnot having personally observed the witnesses, [we are] convinced of the [appellant]’s\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” United States v. Turner, 25 M.J. 324, 325\n(C.M.A. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). In conducting this unique appellate\nrole, we take “a fresh, impartial look at the evidence,” applying “neither a presumption of\ninnocence nor a presumption of guilt” to “make [our] own independent determination as\nto whether the evidence constitutes proof of each required element beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” Washington, 57 M.J. at 399.\n\n       The test for legal sufficiency of the evidence is “whether, considering the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable factfinder could have found\nall the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.” Turner, 25 M.J. at 324. “[I]n\nresolving questions of legal sufficiency, we are bound to draw every reasonable inference\nfrom the evidence of record in favor of the prosecution.” United States v. Barner,\n56 M.J. 131, 134 (C.A.A.F. 2001). Our assessment of legal and factual sufficiency is\nlimited to the evidence produced at trial. United States v. Dykes, 38 M.J. 270, 272\n(C.M.A. 1993).\n\n       Under the law in effect at the time of the offense, the elements of aggravated\nsexual contact with a child who had not yet attained the age of 12 years are: (1) the\nappellant engaged in sexual contact with a child and (2) at the time of the contact, the\nchild had not attained the age of 12 years. See Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM),\nUnited States, App. 28, ¶ 45.b.(7)(a) (2012 ed.). Sexual contact is “the intentional\n\n\n                                             3                                    ACM 38386\n\ftouching, either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia . . . of another person . . .\nwith an intent to abuse, humiliate, or degrade any person or to arouse or gratify the sexual\ndesire of any person.” MCM, App. 28, ¶ 45.a.(t). Here, the appellant was charged with\nand convicted of “touch[ing] the vagina” of the child on divers occasions.\n\n        The appellant argues that there was no evidence he touched the child’s genitalia.\nConceding the child testified she “felt rubbing after cream was applied,” the appellant\nasserts that because she could not see who or what touched her, the evidence is factually\ninsufficient. The testimony of the child and the appellant were consistent in that they\nwere the only two people present when the events occurred. The appellant does not\nassert that the child touched herself nor does he deny that he applied a substance upon her\nvagina.\n\n        We have reviewed and considered the entire record of trial. We have also made\nallowances for not having personally observed the witnesses. Having paid particular\nattention to the matters raised by the appellant, we find the evidence factually and legally\nsufficient to support his conviction for aggravated sexual contact by touching the child’s\nvagina on two occasions. Although the child’s statements to the several people to whom\nshe had to speak about these events contain some inconsistencies, and while she\nanswered “I don’t know” to several of the questions asked of her, we are nonetheless\nconvinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt and also find a reasonable\nfactfinder could have found all the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n                          Staff Judge Advocate’s Recommendation\n\n        The appellant alleges that the staff judge advocate’s recommendation (SJAR) and\nits addendum were erroneous because they failed to reflect the appellant’s 182 days in\npretrial confinement. While the Government acknowledges that neither the SJAR nor the\npersonal data sheet reflect the pretrial confinement, it argues that the convening authority\nwas aware of, and considered, the appellant’s pretrial confinement before taking action\nbecause the pretrial confinement is indicated on the accompanying Air Force Form 1359,\nReport of Result of Trial. The Government further argues that because there is no\nrequirement to advise the convening authority of pretrial confinement served, there was\nno error in its omission. See R.C.M. 1106(d)(3).\n\n       Proper completion of post-trial processing is a question of law we review de novo.\nUnited States v. Sheffield, 60 M.J. 591, 593 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2004) (citing\nUnited States v. Kho, 54 M.J. 63 (C.A.A.F. 2000)). Failure to comment in a timely\nmanner on matters in the SJAR, or on matters attached to the SJAR, waives any later\nclaim of error in the absence of plain error. R.C.M. 1106(f)(6); United States v. Scalo, 60\nM.J. 435, 436 (C.A.A.F. 2005). “To prevail under a plain error analysis, [the appellant\nbears the burden of showing] that: ‘(1) there was an error; (2) it was plain or obvious; and\n(3) the error materially prejudiced a substantial right.’” Scalo, 60 M.J. at 436 (quoting\n\n\n                                               4                                      ACM 38386\n\fKho, 54 M.J. at 65). An appellant must make some “colorable showing of possible\nprejudice in terms of how the [perceived error] potentially affected [his] opportunity for\nclemency.” Id. at 437.\n\n       While we acknowledge that R.C.M. 1106 does not explicitly require the convening\nauthority be advised of pretrial confinement served, here we have more than a simple\nomission of information. The personal data sheet submitted to the convening authority\naffirmatively stated, “PRETRIAL RESTRAINT: NONE.” The personal data sheet was\nmaterially inconsistent with the AF Form 1359, and neither the SJAR nor its addendum\nexplained the inconsistency. We therefore find that there was error and that the error was\nboth plain and obvious.\n\n       However, this error does not automatically warrant relief. An error in a post-trial\nSJAR to the convening authority “does not result in an automatic return by the appellate\ncourt of the case to the convening authority.” United States v. Green, 44 M.J. 93, 95\n(C.A.A.F. 1996). “Instead, an appellate court may determine if the accused has been\nprejudiced by testing whether the alleged error has any merit and would have led to a\nfavorable recommendation by the SJA or corrective action by the convening authority.”\nId.\n\n       The appellant argues that the prejudice he suffered was his inability to comment in\nhis clemency submission on “what happened during pretrial confinement and why the\nconvening authority should provide meaningful relief in clemency.” However, the\nappellant fails to demonstrate why he was unable to raise these matters initially,\nregardless of whether pretrial confinement was reflected in the SJAR. The appellant\nknew he had been in pretrial confinement; there was nothing preventing him from raising\nthose matters.\n\n        Despite the error in the documents provided by the SJA to the convening\nauthority, the appellant himself told the convening authority of his pretrial confinement.\nIn his clemency submission, he wrote, “I have been confined since\n24 October 2012,” six months before the date of his trial, and he described that\nconfinement’s effect upon him. Moreover, by operation of law the appellant’s time in\npretrial confinement will be credited against his sentence. See United States v. Allen,\n17 M.J. 126 (C.M.A. 1994). We therefore conclude that the appellant has failed to\nestablish prejudice and therefore reject this assignment of error.\n\n                               Pretrial confinement credit\n\n       After authorities at the child’s school reported her allegations to local civilian\npolice, a forensic interview of the child was conducted by the local police. Based on the\nresult of the civilian police investigation, the appellant was arrested on 25 October 2012\nfor two counts of rape and was placed in the Sedgwick County Jail. The Air Force\n\n\n                                            5                                   ACM 38386\n\frequested jurisdiction of the case shortly thereafter, but the civilian prosecutor did not\ncede jurisdiction to the military until 19 February 2013, at which time the appellant left\ncivilian pretrial confinement and was placed into military pretrial confinement on\nMcConnell Air Force Base.\n\n       Pursuant to United States v. Grostefon, the appellant argues he is entitled to an\nadditional 118 days of pretrial confinement credit because he was housed in Sedgwick\nCounty Jail in a large “pod” that also held foreign nationals. We disagree.\n\n       In reviewing pretrial confinement issues, we defer to the military judge’s findings\nof fact where they are not clearly erroneous. United States v. King, 61 M.J. 225, 227\n(C.A.A.F. 2005). We review de novo the application of the facts to the law and whether\nthe appellant’s confinement violates Article 12, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 812. United States v.\nWise, 64 M.J. 468, 473–74 (C.A.A.F. 2007).\n\n       Article 12, UCMJ, provides, “No member of the armed forces may be placed in\nconfinement in immediate association with enemy prisoners or other foreign nationals not\nmembers of the armed forces.” The “immediate association” language means that\nmilitary members can be confined in the same jail or brig as a foreign national, but they\nhave to be segregated. Wise, 64 M.J. at 476–77.\n\n        Under Article 12, UCMJ, a confinee must exhaust his administrative remedies\nprior to judicial intervention absent unusual or egregious circumstances. United States v.\nMcPherson, 73 M.J. 393, 397 (C.A.A.F. 2014). This requirement “furthers two related\ngoals: (1) the ‘resolution of grievances at the lowest possible level’ with ‘prompt\namelioration’ of the complaint while the prisoner suffers the condition and (2) the\ndevelopment of an adequate record to aid appellate review. Id.\n\n       This issue was raised at trial, and the military judge made factual findings which\nwere amply supported by the evidence, not clearly erroneous, and which we adopt as our\nown. The dispositive factual finding on this issue is that during the period the appellant\nwas housed in civilian confinement—the facility in which he alleges he was commingled\nwith foreign nationals—he was held by civilian authorities on civilian charges without\nAir Force involvement or request. The appellant does not challenge this finding but\ninstead argues that Article 12, UCMJ, proscriptions apply to any authority that confines a\nmilitary member, regardless of the jurisdiction or basis. Neither we nor our superior\ncourt have so held, and we decline to do so today. See United States v. Escobar, __ M.J.\n__, __ (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2014) (Articles 12 and 13, UCMJ, “do not provide protection\nto servicemembers who are confined by a separate sovereign pending criminal\nprosecution by that sovereign, where such confinement is not at the behest of military\nauthorities”). Furthermore, the appellant made no effort to exhaust his administrative\nremedies with local confinement facilities or his chain of command before raising this\nissue with the military judge. We reject this assignment of error.\n\n\n                                            6                                   ACM 38386\n\f                                       Conclusion\n\n       The approved findings and sentence are correct in law and fact, and no error\nmaterially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant occurred. Articles 59(a)\nand 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §§ 859(a), 866(c). Accordingly, the findings and the\nsentence are AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n             FOR THE COURT\n\n\n             STEVEN LUCAS\n             Clerk of the Court\n\n\n\n\n                                            7                                   ACM 38386\n\f",

After the liquid was\nput on her vagina, she felt a sharp pain that lasted for a few minutes and then stopped.\nShe also testified that the appellant told her to “relax” and that the pain would go away\nafter a few minutes. The appellant also told her not to tell anyone about this.\n\n       The child’s mother testified to deny the appellant’s claim she had asked him to\napply the cream on her daughter. She also described an incident where the child was\ncrying hysterically and said the appellant had her lie on his bed naked. When confronted\nby the child’s mother, the appellant said he had been helping the child with her hygiene.\n\n\n\n1\n    This issue is raised pursuant to United States v. Grostefon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.M.A. 1982).\n\n\n                                                            2                                 ACM 38386\n\f       The appellant testified and admitted applying cream to the child’s vagina but said\nhe had done so for her own benefit and not for sexual gratification. According to the\nappellant, on two occasions after the child had wet her pants, he told her to take a bath to\nclean herself. At the conclusion of the bath, as he assisted her out of the tub, he saw that\nher vaginal lips were red and swollen, and thus he chose to apply the cream. He\ncorroborated the child’s testimony that she was naked, on her back, and with a towel on\nher head when the incident occurred. He denied spreading her legs as she claimed,\ninstead testifying that she did so herself.\n\n        He further testified that the liquid he applied was from a tube that had the word\n“rash” on it. He explained that the tube was in a drawer that contained several tubes of\nvarious ointments and creams and that he grabbed the one he thought would work best.\nThe appellant testified that he had never before or since applied cream to the child, and\nthat although the child’s mother had not specifically asked him to do so, he thought it was\nthe best thing to do.\n\n                              Legal and Factual Sufficiency\n\n       We review issues of factual and legal sufficiency de novo. United States v.\nWashington, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 399 (C.A.A.F. 2002). The test for factual sufficiency is\n“whether, after weighing the evidence in the record of trial and making allowances for\nnot having personally observed the witnesses, [we are] convinced of the [appellant]’s\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” United States v. Turner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 325\n(C.M.A. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). In conducting this unique appellate\nrole, we take “a fresh, impartial look at the evidence,” applying “neither a presumption of\ninnocence nor a presumption of guilt” to “make [our] own independent determination as\nto whether the evidence constitutes proof of each required element beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” Washington, 57 M.J. at 399.\n\n       The test for legal sufficiency of the evidence is “whether, considering the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable factfinder could have found\nall the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.” Turner, 25 M.J. at 324. “[I]n\nresolving questions of legal sufficiency, we are bound to draw every reasonable inference\nfrom the evidence of record in favor of the prosecution.” United States v. Barner,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134 (C.A.A.F. 2001). Our assessment of legal and factual sufficiency is\nlimited to the evidence produced at trial. United States v. Dykes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272\n(C.M.A. 1993).\n\n       Under the law in effect at the time of the offense, the elements of aggravated\nsexual contact with a child who had not yet attained the age of 12 years are: (1) the\nappellant engaged in sexual contact with a child and (2) at the time of the contact, the\nchild had not attained the age of 12 years. See Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM),\nUnited States, App. 28, ¶ 45.b.(7)(a) (2012 ed.). Sexual contact is “the intentional\n\n\n                                             3                                    ACM 38386\n\ftouching, either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia . . . of another person . . .\nwith an intent to abuse, humiliate, or degrade any person or to arouse or gratify the sexual\ndesire of any person.” MCM, App. 28, ¶ 45.a.(t). Here, the appellant was charged with\nand convicted of “touch[ing] the vagina” of the child on divers occasions.\n\n        The appellant argues that there was no evidence he touched the child’s genitalia.\nConceding the child testified she “felt rubbing after cream was applied,” the appellant\nasserts that because she could not see who or what touched her, the evidence is factually\ninsufficient. The testimony of the child and the appellant were consistent in that they\nwere the only two people present when the events occurred. The appellant does not\nassert that the child touched herself nor does he deny that he applied a substance upon her\nvagina.\n\n        We have reviewed and considered the entire record of trial. We have also made\nallowances for not having personally observed the witnesses. Having paid particular\nattention to the matters raised by the appellant, we find the evidence factually and legally\nsufficient to support his conviction for aggravated sexual contact by touching the child’s\nvagina on two occasions. Although the child’s statements to the several people to whom\nshe had to speak about these events contain some inconsistencies, and while she\nanswered “I don’t know” to several of the questions asked of her, we are nonetheless\nconvinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt and also find a reasonable\nfactfinder could have found all the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n                          Staff Judge Advocate’s Recommendation\n\n        The appellant alleges that the staff judge advocate’s recommendation (SJAR) and\nits addendum were erroneous because they failed to reflect the appellant’s 182 days in\npretrial confinement. While the Government acknowledges that neither the SJAR nor the\npersonal data sheet reflect the pretrial confinement, it argues that the convening authority\nwas aware of, and considered, the appellant’s pretrial confinement before taking action\nbecause the pretrial confinement is indicated on the accompanying Air Force Form 1359,\nReport of Result of Trial. The Government further argues that because there is no\nrequirement to advise the convening authority of pretrial confinement served, there was\nno error in its omission. See R.C.M. 1106(d)(3).\n\n       Proper completion of post-trial processing is a question of law we review de novo.\nUnited States v. Sheffield, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2004) (citing\nUnited States v. Kho, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.A.A.F. 2000)). Failure to comment in a timely\nmanner on matters in the SJAR, or on matters attached to the SJAR, waives any later\nclaim of error in the absence of plain error. R.C.M. 1106(f)(6); United States v. Scalo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436 (C.A.A.F. 2005). “To prevail under a plain error analysis, [the appellant\nbears the burden of showing] that: ‘(1) there was an error; (2) it was plain or obvious; and\n(3) the error materially prejudiced a substantial right.’” Scalo, 60 M.J. at 436 (quoting\n\n\n                                               4                                      ACM 38386\n\fKho, 54 M.J. at 65). An appellant must make some “colorable showing of possible\nprejudice in terms of how the [perceived error] potentially affected [his] opportunity for\nclemency.” Id. at 437.\n\n       While we acknowledge that R.C.M. 1106 does not explicitly require the convening\nauthority be advised of pretrial confinement served, here we have more than a simple\nomission of information. The personal data sheet submitted to the convening authority\naffirmatively stated, “PRETRIAL RESTRAINT: NONE.” The personal data sheet was\nmaterially inconsistent with the AF Form 1359, and neither the SJAR nor its addendum\nexplained the inconsistency. We therefore find that there was error and that the error was\nboth plain and obvious.\n\n       However, this error does not automatically warrant relief. An error in a post-trial\nSJAR to the convening authority “does not result in an automatic return by the appellate\ncourt of the case to the convening authority.” United States v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95\n(C.A.A.F. 1996). “Instead, an appellate court may determine if the accused has been\nprejudiced by testing whether the alleged error has any merit and would have led to a\nfavorable recommendation by the SJA or corrective action by the convening authority.”\nId.\n\n       The appellant argues that the prejudice he suffered was his inability to comment in\nhis clemency submission on “what happened during pretrial confinement and why the\nconvening authority should provide meaningful relief in clemency.” However, the\nappellant fails to demonstrate why he was unable to raise these matters initially,\nregardless of whether pretrial confinement was reflected in the SJAR. The appellant\nknew he had been in pretrial confinement; there was nothing preventing him from raising\nthose matters.\n\n        Despite the error in the documents provided by the SJA to the convening\nauthority, the appellant himself told the convening authority of his pretrial confinement.\nIn his clemency submission, he wrote, “I have been confined since\n24 October 2012,” six months before the date of his trial, and he described that\nconfinement’s effect upon him. Moreover, by operation of law the appellant’s time in\npretrial confinement will be credited against his sentence. See United States v. Allen,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.M.A. 1994). We therefore conclude that the appellant has failed to\nestablish prejudice and therefore reject this assignment of error.\n\n                               Pretrial confinement credit\n\n       After authorities at the child’s school reported her allegations to local civilian\npolice, a forensic interview of the child was conducted by the local police. Based on the\nresult of the civilian police investigation, the appellant was arrested on 25 October 2012\nfor two counts of rape and was placed in the Sedgwick County Jail. The Air Force\n\n\n                                            5                                   ACM 38386\n\frequested jurisdiction of the case shortly thereafter, but the civilian prosecutor did not\ncede jurisdiction to the military until 19 February 2013, at which time the appellant left\ncivilian pretrial confinement and was placed into military pretrial confinement on\nMcConnell Air Force Base.\n\n       Pursuant to United States v. Grostefon, the appellant argues he is entitled to an\nadditional 118 days of pretrial confinement credit because he was housed in Sedgwick\nCounty Jail in a large “pod” that also held foreign nationals. We disagree.\n\n       In reviewing pretrial confinement issues, we defer to the military judge’s findings\nof fact where they are not clearly erroneous. United States v. King, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227\n(C.A.A.F. 2005). We review de novo the application of the facts to the law and whether\nthe appellant’s confinement violates Article 12, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 812. United States v.\nWise, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 473–74 (C.A.A.F. 2007).\n\n       Article 12, UCMJ, provides, “No member of the armed forces may be placed in\nconfinement in immediate association with enemy prisoners or other foreign nationals not\nmembers of the armed forces.” The “immediate association” language means that\nmilitary members can be confined in the same jail or brig as a foreign national, but they\nhave to be segregated. Wise, 64 M.J. at 476–77.\n\n        Under Article 12, UCMJ, a confinee must exhaust his administrative remedies\nprior to judicial intervention absent unusual or egregious circumstances. United States v.\nMcPherson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 397 (C.A.A.F. 2014). This requirement “furthers two related\ngoals: (1) the ‘resolution of grievances at the lowest possible level’ with ‘prompt\namelioration’ of the complaint while the prisoner suffers the condition and (2) the\ndevelopment of an adequate record to aid appellate review. Id.\n\n       This issue was raised at trial, and the military judge made factual findings which\nwere amply supported by the evidence, not clearly erroneous, and which we adopt as our\nown. The dispositive factual finding on this issue is that during the period the appellant\nwas housed in civilian confinement—the facility in which he alleges he was commingled\nwith foreign nationals—he was held by civilian authorities on civilian charges without\nAir Force involvement or request. The appellant does not challenge this finding but\ninstead argues that Article 12, UCMJ, proscriptions apply to any authority that confines a\nmilitary member, regardless of the jurisdiction or basis. Neither we nor our superior\ncourt have so held, and we decline to do so today. See United States v. Escobar, __ M.J.\n__, __ (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2014) (Articles 12 and 13, UCMJ, “do not provide protection\nto servicemembers who are confined by a separate sovereign pending criminal\nprosecution by that sovereign, where such confinement is not at the behest of military\nauthorities”). Furthermore, the appellant made no effort to exhaust his administrative\nremedies with local confinement facilities or his chain of command before raising this\nissue with the military judge. We reject this assignment of error.\n\n\n                                            6                                   ACM 38386\n\f                                       Conclusion\n\n       The approved findings and sentence are correct in law and fact, and no error\nmaterially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant occurred. Articles 59(a)\nand 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §§ 859(a), 866(c). Accordingly, the findings and the\nsentence are AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n             FOR THE COURT\n\n\n             STEVEN LUCAS\n             Clerk of the Court\n\n\n\n\n                                            7                                   ACM 38386\n\f</pre>",
