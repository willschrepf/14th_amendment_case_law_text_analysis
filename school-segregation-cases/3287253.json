The first appearance of this enactment is section 18, chapter 228, 1911 Session Laws, page 739, as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Sec. 18. All life and miscellaneous insurance companies now doing business in this State, or that may hereafter do business in this State, must file with the Insurance Commissioner, annually on or before the fifteenth day of March of each year, a statement, under oath, stating the amount of all gross premiums received by said company during the year ending December thirty-first preceding, in this State, and shall pay to the Insurance Commissioner a tax of two (2) per cent on all such gross premiums collected. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 542</span> </p>\n<p>\"All fire insurance companies now doing business in this State or that may hereafter do business in this State, must file with the Insurance Commissioner, annually on or before the fifteenth day of March of each year, a statement under oath, stating amount of all gross premiums received by said company during the year ending December thirty-first preceding, in this State, and pay to the Insurance Commissioner a tax of two (2) per cent on all such gross premiums collected, less premiums and cancellations returned to policy holders. . . . .\"</p>\n<p>from which it will be noticed that as to all life and miscellaneous insurance companies the tax of 2 per cent, was levied on all \"gross premiums received\" and \"collected\" without deduction, whereas, as to fire insurance companies, there was express provision allowing deductions as in substance contended for by respondent. This section was amended in section 6, chapter 97, 1913 Session Laws, page 391 to read as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Sec. 18. All insurance companies licensed to transact business in this State in one or more of classes (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), and (14) of Section 10 of this Act shall file with the Insurance Commissioner annually, on or before the first day of March of each year, a statement, under oath, showing the amount of all gross premiums received by said company in this State during the year ending December 31st next preceding, and shall pay to the Insurance Commissioner a tax of two per cent (2 per cent) on all such gross premiums collected.</p>\n<p>\"All insurance companies licensed to transact business in this State in classes (1) and (2), or either of them, of Section 10 of this Act, shall file with the Insurance Commissioner annually, on or before the first day of March of each year, a statement, under oath, showing the amount of all gross premiums received by said company on risks situated in this State during the year ending December 31st next preceding, and pay to the Insurance Commissioner a tax of two per cent (2 per cent) on the amount of such gross premiums collected in excess of premiums and cancellations returned to such policy holders. . . . .\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 543</span> </p>\n<p>Instead of the words \"all life and miscellaneous insurance companies\" as contained in the original Section 18, without further classification or designation, the amendment says \"all insurance companies licensed to transact business in this State in . . . . classes (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), and (14) of Section 10 of this Act (1913) shall file with the Insurance Commissioner annually . . . .\" and the second paragraph designated classes (1) and (2) of section 10 instead of fire insurance companies as permitted to make deductions.</p>\n<p>The section 10 referred to being set forth at page 397 of the 1913 Session Laws, classifying insurance business in fourteen divisions or classes. Therefore and thereby, while the amendment in 1913 classified insurance businesses, the provisions of section 18 of the 1911 act amended in section 6 of the 1913 act remained, so far as the controversy here is involved, the same.</p>\n<p>Chapter 119, of the Session Laws, 1919, page 405, amended what was originally the first paragraph of section 18, 1911 Session Laws which had been carried into the Compiled Laws, as section 220:91<sup id=\"ref-fn1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> granting to class 3 (life), the right to deduct refunds, dividends and coupons paid policyholders in the nature of returned premiums.</p>\n<p>Respondent is engaged in a general casualty and surety insurance business, thus being in classes 4 and 5, sections<cross_reference>40-305</cross_reference>, and <cross_reference>40-306</cross_reference>, I. C. A., thus not in one of the excepted classes entitled to make deductions.</p>\n<p>The codifier of the Compiled Laws split up the original section 18, putting the first sentence of the second paragraph into sec. 220:90; the first paragraph into 220:91; the second sentence in the second paragraph into 220:92; and putting the fourth sentence in the second paragraph of section 18,<em>supra</em>, into sec. 220:93; which, thus separated, were carried into the Compiled Statutes, and in turn into the present Idaho Code Annotated as secs. <cross_reference>40-803</cross_reference> et seq. Such reparagraphing does not affect the construction to be placed upon <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 544</span> \nthe statute, nor has the substance been changed. (39 C. J. 897, sec. 494.) The tracing and analysis of the statutes has this effect upon the controversy: Namely, that when first enacted and to the present, a distinction has existed between certain kinds of insurance business in the computation of the gross premiums upon which the tax is levied. The amount of the tax was increased from 2 per cent to 3 per cent in the 1933 amendment.</p>\n<p>The following cases are cited by respondent in support of its contention: <em>In re Continental Casualty Co.</em>, <cross_reference>189 Iowa, 933</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>179 N.W. 185</cross_reference>; <em>German Alliance Ins.

C. A. Respondent's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 545</span> \ncontention makes meaningless the language of the act, which by the proviso modified the term \"gross premiums\" allowing for deduction in fire insurance. If \"gross premiums\" without this proviso meant the same thing as urged by respondent, why did the legislature make the proviso? We cannot consider that the legislature did not thus clearly enunciate its meaning and intention. Our statute, if read in the arrangement as originally passed, is thus clear and definite.</p>\n<p>Furthermore while it is unnecessary for us to construe section <cross_reference>40-902</cross_reference>, I. C. A., as such, the following portion of that section has a legitimate bearing on our search for legislative intent; <em>Amsbary v. City of Twin Falls</em>, <cross_reference>34 Idaho 313</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>200 P. 723</cross_reference>; <em>Cook v. Massey</em>, <cross_reference>38 Idaho 264</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>220 P. 1088</cross_reference>, 35 A.L.R. 200; <em>State v. Kelley</em>, <cross_reference>39 Idaho 668</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>229 P. 659</cross_reference>:</p>\n<p>\". . . . A resident agent shall countersign all policies so issued (except policies of life insurance) and shall receive the full commission <em>when the premium is paid, to the end that</em><em>the state may receive the tax required by law to be paid</em> on the premiums collected for insurance on all persons and property resident or located within this state: provided, this section shall not apply to life insurance companies . . . .\" (italics ours).</p>\n<p>This section comes to us from the 1911 act, in identical language, and lends at least light to this extent: that the time when the premium is paid to the company is correlated to the meaning to be attached to the words \"received\" and \"collected\" in section <cross_reference>40-804</cross_reference>, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>Furthermore, the stipulation recites that at least for some time past the Director of the Bureau of Insurance has placed upon the statute involved the construction contended for by appellant, which contemporary construction by a co-ordinate branch of the government, charged with the duty of enforcing the statute, is when called upon by the courts to construe the statute, entitled to consideration and carries weight for two reasons: First, it is a practical and administrative construction of the act; and second, where extended over a period of time leads to the conclusion that such construction being known to the legislature has received its tacit approval as being correct. (<em>In re Speer</em>, <cross_reference>53 Idaho 293</cross_reference>, 23 Pac. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 546</span> \n(2d) 239, 88 A.L.R. 1086; <em>Bashore v. Adolf</em>, <cross_reference>41 Idaho 84</cross_reference> at 91,<cross_reference>238 P. 534</cross_reference>, 41 A.L.R. 932; <em>State v. Omaechevviaria</em>, <cross_reference>27 Idaho 797</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>152 P. 280</cross_reference>; 25 R. C. L. 1043, sec. 274; 59 C. J. 1025 et seq., sec. 609; 59 C. J. 1030; 59 C. J. 1064, sec. 626, n. 54.) While the conclusion reached is opposite to ours, the supporting statutory and administrative history being likewise opposite, the reasons support our conclusion in <em>New England</em><em>Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Reece</em>, <cross_reference>169 Tenn. 84</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>83 S.W.2d 238</cross_reference> at 241.</p>\n<p>The 1937 session of the legislature, confirmed the conclusion that appellant's theory is correct, by amending such sec.<cross_reference>40-804</cross_reference>, <em>supra</em>, to read, as pertinent herein, as follows:</p>\n<p>\". . . . showing the amount of all gross premiums received by said company <em>on risks</em> in this state during the year ending December thirty-first next preceding, and shall pay to the department a tax of three per cent, on . . . . <em>the amount of</em><em>such gross premiums collected in excess of premiums and</em><em>cancellations returned to such policyholders:</em> provided, however, that <em>only such</em> companies licensed to transact business in class 3 may in computing the gross premiums <em>also</em> deduct the amount of . . . . dividends and coupons paid policyholders. . . . .\"</p>\n<p>approved by the Governor, February 16, 1937, chapter 33, 1937 Session Laws, page 44. The rule being that where an amendment is made it carries with it the presumption that the legislature intended the statute thus amended to have a meaning different than theretofore accorded it. (<em>In re Segregation of School</em><em>Dist. No. 58</em>, <cross_reference>34 Idaho 222</cross_reference> at 228, <cross_reference>200 P. 138</cross_reference>; <em>Moody v. State</em><em>Highway Dept.</em>, <cross_reference>56 Idaho 21</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>48 P.2d 1108</cross_reference>; 59 C. J. 1097, n. 35; 25 R. C. L. 1051, sec. 276, nn. 4, 5.)</p>\n<p>Respondent argues that if appellant's theory be countenanced it will make the act unconstitutional because there is no justifiable basis for allowing deductions as to certain classes of insurance and not as to others as provided in sec. <cross_reference>40-803</cross_reference>, and sec. <cross_reference>40-804</cross_reference>, I. C. A., citing <em>Penney Co. v. Diefendorf</em>,<cross_reference>54 Idaho 374</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>32 P.2d 784</cross_reference>. The matter of classification is discussed there at length, various pertinent discussions from decisions being quoted and referred to, with this conclusion, which we believe answers respondent's contention: <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 547</span> </p>\n<p>\"This court has specifically held that the legislature has the right and power to classify for taxation purposes, and in so classifying make exemptions. In <em>Diefendorf v. Gallet</em>,<cross_reference>51 Idaho 619</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>642</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>10 P.2d 307</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>316</cross_reference>, this court said:</p>\n<p>\" 'The state has the power to classify for the purposes of taxation, only limited by the rule that the classification must be reasonable and founded upon differences between the parties. The equality clause does not forbid reasonable classification. Discrimination through classification is said to violate that clause only where it is such as \"to preclude the assumption that it was made in the exercise of legislative judgment and discretion.\" (<em>Stebbins v. Riley</em>, <cross_reference>268 U.S. 137</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>45 Sup. Ct. 424</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>69 L. ed. 884</cross_reference>, 44 A.L.R. 1454).' \" See, also, 61 C. J. 309, sec. 301, n. 83.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, without intending to delineate exact niceties as to the distinction between property, excise or license taxes, it is apparent that the exaction in the case at bar is in the nature of an excise lieu property tax, not a license tax, and the words \"gross premiums received\" and \"collected\" are merely a measuring stick for determining what amount and how the property of the chargeable insurance companies shall be determined and fixed for assessment, since license fees are separately provided for in section <cross_reference>40-811</cross_reference>, I. C. A., and section <cross_reference>40-806</cross_reference>, I. C. A., specifically states that this 3 per cent tax shall:</p>\n<p>\". . . . be in lieu of all other taxes upon premiums <em>and upon</em><em>the personal property of such companies and the shares of stock</em><em>or assets thereof;</em> provided, that all real property, if any, of such company, shall be listed, assessed and taxed the same as real property of like character of individuals\" (italics ours).</p>\n<p>See <em>National Savings  Loan Assn. v.

All life and miscellaneous insurance companies now doing business in this State, or that may hereafter do business in this State, must file with the Insurance Commissioner, annually on or before the fifteenth day of March of each year, a statement, under oath, stating the amount of all gross premiums received by said company during the year ending December thirty-first preceding, in this State, and shall pay to the Insurance Commissioner a tax of two (2) per cent on all such gross premiums collected. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 542</span> </p>\n<p>\"All fire insurance companies now doing business in this State or that may hereafter do business in this State, must file with the Insurance Commissioner, annually on or before the fifteenth day of March of each year, a statement under oath, stating amount of all gross premiums received by said company during the year ending December thirty-first preceding, in this State, and pay to the Insurance Commissioner a tax of two (2) per cent on all such gross premiums collected, less premiums and cancellations returned to policy holders. . . . .\"</p>\n<p>from which it will be noticed that as to all life and miscellaneous insurance companies the tax of 2 per cent, was levied on all \"gross premiums received\" and \"collected\" without deduction, whereas, as to fire insurance companies, there was express provision allowing deductions as in substance contended for by respondent. This section was amended in section 6, chapter 97, 1913 Session Laws, page 391 to read as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Sec. 18. All insurance companies licensed to transact business in this State in one or more of classes (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), and (14) of Section 10 of this Act shall file with the Insurance Commissioner annually, on or before the first day of March of each year, a statement, under oath, showing the amount of all gross premiums received by said company in this State during the year ending December 31st next preceding, and shall pay to the Insurance Commissioner a tax of two per cent (2 per cent) on all such gross premiums collected.</p>\n<p>\"All insurance companies licensed to transact business in this State in classes (1) and (2), or either of them, of Section 10 of this Act, shall file with the Insurance Commissioner annually, on or before the first day of March of each year, a statement, under oath, showing the amount of all gross premiums received by said company on risks situated in this State during the year ending December 31st next preceding, and pay to the Insurance Commissioner a tax of two per cent (2 per cent) on the amount of such gross premiums collected in excess of premiums and cancellations returned to such policy holders. . . . .\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 543</span> </p>\n<p>Instead of the words \"all life and miscellaneous insurance companies\" as contained in the original Section 18, without further classification or designation, the amendment says \"all insurance companies licensed to transact business in this State in . . . . classes (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), and (14) of Section 10 of this Act (1913) shall file with the Insurance Commissioner annually . . . .\" and the second paragraph designated classes (1) and (2) of section 10 instead of fire insurance companies as permitted to make deductions.</p>\n<p>The section 10 referred to being set forth at page 397 of the 1913 Session Laws, classifying insurance business in fourteen divisions or classes. Therefore and thereby, while the amendment in 1913 classified insurance businesses, the provisions of section 18 of the 1911 act amended in section 6 of the 1913 act remained, so far as the controversy here is involved, the same.</p>\n<p>Chapter 119, of the Session Laws, 1919, page 405, amended what was originally the first paragraph of section 18, 1911 Session Laws which had been carried into the Compiled Laws, as section 220:91<sup id=\"ref-fn1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> granting to class 3 (life), the right to deduct refunds, dividends and coupons paid policyholders in the nature of returned premiums.</p>\n<p>Respondent is engaged in a general casualty and surety insurance business, thus being in classes 4 and 5, sections<cross_reference>40-305</cross_reference>, and <cross_reference>40-306</cross_reference>, I. C. A., thus not in one of the excepted classes entitled to make deductions.</p>\n<p>The codifier of the Compiled Laws split up the original section 18, putting the first sentence of the second paragraph into sec. 220:90; the first paragraph into 220:91; the second sentence in the second paragraph into 220:92; and putting the fourth sentence in the second paragraph of section 18,<em>supra</em>, into sec. 220:93; which, thus separated, were carried into the Compiled Statutes, and in turn into the present Idaho Code Annotated as secs. <cross_reference>40-803</cross_reference> et seq. Such reparagraphing does not affect the construction to be placed upon <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 544</span> \nthe statute, nor has the substance been changed. (39 C. J. 897, sec. 494.) The tracing and analysis of the statutes has this effect upon the controversy: Namely, that when first enacted and to the present, a distinction has existed between certain kinds of insurance business in the computation of the gross premiums upon which the tax is levied. The amount of the tax was increased from 2 per cent to 3 per cent in the 1933 amendment.</p>\n<p>The following cases are cited by respondent in support of its contention: <em>In re Continental Casualty Co.</em>, <cross_reference>189 Iowa, 933</cross_reference>,<cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></span></cross_reference>; <em>German Alliance Ins.

Crowley, Assistant Attorney General, for Appellant.\n\nThe true legislative intent is that the whole amount received is taxable without deduction of premiums returned on cancelation of policies. It has so been held in other jurisdictions. ( Massachusetts Bond  Ins. Co. v. Chorn , 274 Mo. 15 ,  201 S.W. 1122 ;  Fire Assn. of Philadelphia v. Love ,  101 Tex. 376 , 108 S.W. 158 ,  810 ;  State v. Hyde ,  304 Mo. 447 , 264 S.W. 381 ;  Jefferson Stand. Life Ins. Co. v. King ,  165 S.C. 219 , 163 S.E. 653 .)\n\nIn case of doubt as to the meaning of statutes, contemporaneous construction by the authorities administering them constitutes a persuasive guide. (25 Ruling Case Law, 1047; State v. Omaechevviaria ,  27 Idaho 797 ,  152 P. 280 ;  Bashore v.  Adolf ,  41 Idaho 84 ,  238 P. 534 ,  536 , 41 A.L.R. 932.)\n\nIn construction of revenue measures the controlling element is the literal meaning of the words used. In this relation the rule varies somewhat from the more liberal rules sometimes applied to other classes of statute. ( Heiner v. Beatty , 17 Fed. (2d) 743;  United States v. Merriam ,  263 U.S. 179 , 44 Sup. Ct. 69 ,  68 L. ed. 240 , 29 A.L.R. 1547; 59 C. J. 1134 and cases in note 95.)\n\nJ.F. Martin for Respondent.\n\nThe statute section  40-804 , Idaho Code Annotated, as amended by chapter 168, 1933 Session Laws, should be construed in the light of the intention of its enactment, and the legislature intended to levy the tax only upon the gross earned premiums. ( In re Continental Casualty Co. ,  189 Iowa, 933 ,  179 N.W. 185 ; German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Van Cleave ,  191 Ill. 410 , 61 N.E. 94 ;  People v. Miller ,  177 N.Y. 515 ,  70 N.E. 10 ;  State v.  Continental Ins. Co. ,  67 Ind. App. 536 ,  116 N.E. 929 .)\n\nThe construction as placed upon a statute by one of the executive department heads has never been given persuasive influence by a court, except where valuable property rights have been gained by reason of such construction. (25 R. C. L. 1043 et seq.; 59 C. J. 1029 and 1032;  Douglas v. Edwards , 298 Fed. 229, at p. 245.)",
