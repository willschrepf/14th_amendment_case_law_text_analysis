Defendants Jon Husted, the Ohio Secretary\nof State, and Mike DeWine, the Ohio Attorney General, appeal from the district court’s order\ngranting Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.       The district court enjoined the\nenforcement of Senate Bill 238 (“SB 238”) and Secretary of State Directive 2014-17, and\nordered the restoration of additional early in-person (“EIP”) voting hours as set forth below on\nthe basis that SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 violate the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. For the reasons set\nforth below, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment granting the preliminary injunction.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Procedural History\n\n        Plaintiffs, Ohio State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of\nColored People et al. (“NAACP”), filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of Ohio on May 1, 2014, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1973\nchallenging the constitutionality and legality of SB 238 and Directive 2014-17.           In their\ncomplaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs allege that SB 238 and Directive 2014-\n06 (now Directive 2014-17) (1) violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment by burdening the fundamental right to vote; and (2) violate Section 2 of the Voting\nRights Act of 1965 by  disproportionately burdening African American voters’ ability to\nparticipate effectively in the political process.\n\n        On June 30, 2014, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to “enjoin the\nenforcement of . . . Senate Bill 238 . . . and require Defendant Husted to set uniform and suitable\nin-person early voting hours for all eligible voters that includes multiple Sundays and weekday\nevening hours.” R. 17 (Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 61) (Page ID #152). Following a hearing on\nAugust 11, 2014, the district court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 3\n\nSeptember 4, 2014. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 70) (Page ID #5917). The district court’s\norder provided as follows:\n\n       That the State of Ohio and the Secretary Husted are enjoined from enforcing and\n       implementing SB 238’s amendments to § 3509.01 of the Ohio Revised Code\n       reducing the EIP voting period from 35 days before an election to the period\n       beginning the day following the close of voter registration;\n       That, for purposes of the 2014 general election, the EIP voting period shall consist\n       of the 35 days prior to the election as was the case [prior] to SB 238’s enactment;\n       That, for the 2014 general election, Defendant Secretary Husted shall require all\n       Ohio county Boards of Election to set uniform and suitable EIP voting hours, in\n       addition to those currently established by Directive 2014-17, for the following\n       days:\n           •   Tuesday, September 30, 2014 through Friday, October 3, 2014;\n           •   Monday, October 6, 2014;\n           •   Evening voting hours between Monday, October 20, 2014 and Friday,\n               October, 24, 2014, and between Monday, October 27, 2014 and Friday,\n               October 31, 2014. Provided, that in setting such hours, Husted must, in\n               good faith, take into consideration the Court’s findings and legal\n               conclusions regarding the impact of a lack of evening voting hours on the\n               protected classes of voters discussed in this Memorandum Opinion and\n               Order; and\n           •   Sunday, October 26, 2014; and\n       That Defendant Secretary Husted is enjoined from preventing individual county\n       Boards of Election from adopting, by a majority vote of their members and in\n       accordance with the procedures established by Ohio election law, EIP voting\n       hours in addition to those specified above and in Directive 2014-17.\n       Further, all issues regarding and pertaining to future elections are deferred and\n       reserved for consideration on the motion for a permanent injunction. In the\n       interim, the Ohio General [A]ssembly is charged with the responsibility of\n       passing legislation consistent with this Memorandum Opinion and Order. . . .\n\nId. at 70–71 (Page ID #5917–18) (footnote omitted).\n\n       Defendants timely appealed the district court’s order granting a preliminary injunction to\nPlaintiffs and moved this court to expedite that appeal.         After the district court denied\nDefendants’ motion for a stay of that order, Defendants moved this court to stay the order\npending appeal. We granted Defendants’ motion to expedite the appeal on September 11, 2014,\nand denied their motion for a stay of the order granting a preliminary injunction to Plaintiffs on\nSeptember 12, 2014.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 4\n\n       The Ohio General Assembly (“General Assembly”) filed a motion with the district court\non July 11, 2014 to intervene in this case, which the district court denied on July 30. On August\n1, the General Assembly filed a notice of appeal of that decision, which appeal is pending under\ncase number 14-3756.\n\n       After the district court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and after\nDefendants filed their notice of appeal in the instant case (appeal number 14-3877), the district\ncourt granted the General Assembly’s renewed motion to intervene, stating that the motion was\ngranted “for the purpose of appeal only.” R. 75 (D. Ct. Order Granting General Assembly’s\nIntervention for Appeal) (Page ID #5954). The General Assembly then filed a notice of appeal\nthat is docketed as appeal number 14-3881. The General Assembly has filed a brief in appeal\n14-3881. It has also filed a motion to file a brief instanter in 14-3877, which included an\naccompanying brief supporting Defendants’ appeal in this case. We do not address in this appeal\nwhether the district court’s intervention decisions were proper, and we do not resolve appeals\nnumbers 14-3756 and 14-3881. Nevertheless, we consider the arguments the General Assembly\npresented in the brief filed in 14-3881 as if it were filed as an amicus curiae brief in this case.\nMoreover, we also consider the arguments presented by amici curiae United States and\nCuyahoga County in briefs filed in this case.\n\nB. Factual Background\n\n       Ohio established early in-person voting largely in response to well-documented problems\nin administering the 2004 general election. As we explained in Obama for America v. Husted,\n697 F.3d 423 (6th Cir. 2012), “[d]uring that election, Ohio voters faced long lines and wait-times\nthat, at some polling places, stretched into the early morning of the following day.” Id. at 426.\nIn League of Women Voters of Ohio v. Brunner, 548 F.3d 463 (6th Cir. 2008), we summarized\nthe problems the League of Women Voters of Ohio reported voters faced as follows:\n\n       Voters were forced to wait from two to twelve hours to vote because of\n       inadequate allocation of voting machines. Voting machines were not allocated\n       proportionately to the voting population, causing more severe wait times in some\n       counties than in others. At least one polling place, voting was not completed until\n       4:00 a.m. on the day following election day. Long wait times caused some voters\n       to leave their polling places without voting in order to attend school, work, or to\n       family responsibilities or because a physical disability prevented them from\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.        Page 5\n\n       standing in line. Poll workers received inadequate training, causing them to\n       provide incorrect instructions and leading to the discounting of votes. In some\n       counties, poll workers misdirected voters to the wrong polling place, forcing them\n       to attempt to vote multiple times and delaying them by up to six hours.\n\nId. at 477–78. In sum, many voters in the 2004 general election were effectively disenfranchised\nand unable to vote.\n\n       In 2005, the Ohio General Assembly passed Substitute House Bill 234 to remedy these\nproblems. 2005 Ohio Laws 40 (Sub. H.B. 234). HB 234 instituted no-fault early voting,\neliminating the requirement that Ohio voters had to provide an excuse for not being able to vote\non Election Day in order to vote early. Early voting is done via an “absentee ballot,” which may\nbe cast either early in-person (“EIP”) at the voter’s Board of Elections’ (“BOE”) designated\nvoting location or by mailing the ballot to the BOE. Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.05(A). Each county\nhas one BOE, which is permitted to operate only one location for EIP voting. Id. § 3501.10(C).\nUnder the 2005 early-voting scheme, the BOEs were required to make absentee ballots available\nfor voters—either for EIP voting or by mail voting—no later than 35 days before the election.\nId. § 3509.01(B)(2) (2014) (as amended Feb. 25, 2014).        Ohio law requires voters to be\nregistered at least 30 days prior to an election.      Ohio Const. § 5.01; Ohio Rev. Code\n§ 3503.01(A). Therefore, Ohio voters could register and vote on the same day for a five-day\nperiod that Plaintiffs refer to as “Golden Week.”\n\n       Until 2012, Ohio law gave each of the BOEs for Ohio’s eighty-eight counties the\ndiscretion to set their own EIP voting hours. R. 62 (Parties’ Statement Undisputed Facts ¶ 6)\n(Page ID #3307). Thus, for the 2008 and 2010 elections each BOE set its own EIP voting hours.\nId. Several counties, including six counties with the highest African American populations in\nOhio, offered early voting during the evenings and on multiple Sundays. Id. ¶ 8 (Page ID\n#3307); R. 65-3 (2010 Early Voting Days & Times) (Page ID #4576–84); R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and\nOrder at 9) (Page ID #5856).\n\n       On August 15, 2012, Secretary Husted issued Directive 2012-35, which established\nuniform EIP voting hours for all BOEs for the 2012 general election. R. 62 (Parties’ Statement\nUndisputed Facts ¶ 15 (Page ID #3308). Directive 2012-35 eliminated all weekend EIP voting\nhours. R. 18-34 (Directive 2012-35) (Page ID #527–28). It did provide for some evening EIP\n\fNo. 14-3877       Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.           Page 6\n\nvoting hours on ten weekdays in the last two weeks before Election Day. Id. Directive 2012-35\nwas challenged in separate litigation as violating the Equal Protection Clause because it allowed\nonly military voters to vote EIP during the last three days before the election. In Obama for\nAmerica, we upheld the district court’s issuance of a preliminary injunction enjoining the\nenforcement of the Directive regarding the last three days of EIP voting before the election;\nunder the preliminary injunction local BOEs had discretion to set EIP voting hours for those days\nso long as those hours applied to all voters, not just military voters. 697 F.3d at 437.\n\n         In the 2008, 2010, and 2012 elections, many Ohio voters took advantage of early voting.\nAs we noted in Obama for America, in 2008 “approximately 1.7 million Ohioans cast their\nballots before election day, amounting to 20.7% of registered voters and 29.7% of the total votes\ncast. . . . In 2010, approximately 1 million Ohioans voted early, and 17.8% of them chose to cast\ntheir ballots in person.” 697 F.3d at 426. In the 2012 election, roughly 32% of Ohioans voted\nearly. R. 18-1 (Smith Rep. at 6) (Page ID #167). Thousands of voters also registered or updated\ntheir registration and voted during Golden Week. R. 62 (Parties’ Statement Undisputed Facts\n¶¶ 10, 14) (Page ID #3308).\n\n         The General Assembly passed SB 238 on February 19, 2014, and it went into effect on\nJune 1, 2014. SB 238 amended the Ohio Code to make the first permitted day of early voting the\nday after the close of voter registration. Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.01(B)(2)–(3). Thus, SB 238\nreduces the total number of EIP voting days by eliminating Golden Week. SB 238 largely\nmirrored the recommendations in a report by the Ohio Association of Election Officials\n(“OAEO”). R. 18-33 (OAEO Rep.) (Page ID #521–26).\n\n         On February 25, 2014, Secretary Husted issued Directive 2014-06, which set EIP voting\nhours for the 2014 primary and general elections. For the general elections, the Directive did not\ninclude EIP voting hours for the following times: (1) the Sunday and Monday immediately\nbefore Election Day; (2) Tuesday, September 30th through Monday, October 6th, the last day for\nvoter registration (Golden Week); (3) Saturday, October 11th, Sunday, October 19th, or Sunday,\nOctober 26th; and (4) evening EIP voting hours after 5 p.m. on all weekdays or after 4 p.m. on\nSaturday, October 25th and Saturday, November 1st. R. 18-36 (Directive 2014-06 at 2) (Page ID\n#531).\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 7\n\n       On June 11, 2014, however, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio\nissued a permanent injunction in Obama for America. No. 2:12-CV-636, 2014 WL 2611316\n(S.D. Ohio June 11, 2014). The district court “require[d] Secretary of State Husted to set\nuniform and suitable in-person early voting hours for all eligible voters for the three days\npreceding all future elections.” Id. at *5. No party appealed this final judgment.\n\n       To comply with the permanent injunction, Secretary Husted issued Directive 2014-17 on\nJune 17, 2014. R. 18-37 (Directive 2014-17) (Page ID #532–33). Directive 2014-17 sets\nuniform EIP voting hours for all future elections in three categories: (1) Presidential General\nElections; (2) Presidential Primary Elections and Gubernatorial General Elections; and\n(3) Regular Municipal Elections, Primary Elections, and Special Elections. Id. As required by\nthe permanent injunction, Directive 2014-17 restores EIP voting hours for the Gubernatorial\nGeneral Elections (the only election relevant to the 2014 general election) on the Sunday and\nMonday immediately prior to Election Day on November 4, 2014. Id. at 2 (Page ID #533). In\nall other respects Directive 2014-17 sets the same EIP voting hours that Directive 2014-06 set for\nthe Gubernatorial General Election. Id.\n\n                                       II. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n       “[F]our factors . . . must [be] balance[d] when considering a motion for preliminary\ninjunction: (1) whether the movant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether\nthe movant would suffer irreparable injury without the injunction; (3) whether issuance of the\ninjunction would cause substantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest would be\nserved by issuance of the injunction.” City of Pontiac Retired Employees Ass’n v. Schimmel,\n751 F.3d 427, 430 (6th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). “We review a district\ncourt’s grant of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.” Obama for America, 697\nF.3d at 428. However, we review de novo the district court’s legal conclusions, and we review\nits factual findings for clear error. Id. Thus, “[t]he district court’s determination will be\ndisturbed only if the district court relied upon clearly erroneous findings of fact, improperly\napplied the governing law, or used an erroneous legal standard.” McNeilly v. Land, 684 F.3d\n611, 614 (6th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, “the ‘determination of\n\fNo. 14-3877       Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.            Page 8\n\nwhether the movant is likely to succeed on the merits is a question of law and is accordingly\nreviewed de novo.’” Liberty Coins, LLC v. Goodman, 748 F.3d 682, 689 (6th Cir. 2014)\n(quoting Bays v. City of Fairborn, 668 F.3d 814, 819 (6th Cir. 2012)).\n\nB. The District Court’s Factual Findings Are Not Clearly Erroneous\n\n       The district court analyzed the record evidence and made a number of factual findings in\ngranting Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. In particular, the district court’s opinion\ncarefully considered the conclusions of Plaintiffs’ four expert witnesses (Smith, Roscigno,\nBurden, and Gronke) and Defendants’ three expert witnesses (Trende, McCarty, and Brunell).\nSee R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 26‒45) (Page ID #5873‒92). After assessing each, the district\ncourt credited Smith’s conclusion that, based on his statistical analysis, African Americans will\nbe disproportionately and negatively affected by the reductions in early voting in SB 238 and\nDirective 2014-17.     Id. at 44‒45 (Page ID #5891‒92).           The district court also accepted\nRoscigno’s “undisputed” findings that disparities in employment and in residential,\ntransportation, and childcare options between African American and white voters significantly\nincreased the cost of casting a vote for African American voters. Id. at 45 (Page ID #5892). The\ndistrict court then relied on Smith’s statistical findings and conclusions in its Equal Protection\nanalysis, and it relied on both Smith’s and Roscigno’s findings in its Voting Rights Act analysis.\n\n       Defendants have not challenged the admissibility of any of Plaintiffs’ experts’\nconclusions under Daubert, either at the district court or on appeal. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow\nPharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). Indeed, Defendants’ brief makes little mention of the district\ncourt’s factual findings or its decision to credit the conclusions of Plaintiffs’ experts. Thus,\nwhether or not the district court properly considered these expert findings is not before us. In\nany event, while they do not dispute Roscigno’s, Burden’s, or Gronke’s conclusions, to the\nextent Defendants and the General Assembly believe the district court improperly credited\nSmith’s findings over the conclusions offered by Defendants’ experts, they are mistaken.\n\n       We review a district court’s factual findings for clear error. Williamson v. Recovery Ltd.\nP’ship, 731 F.3d 608, 627 (6th Cir. 2013). “When reviewing for clear error, we cannot substitute\nour judgment for that of the lower court but rather must uphold the lower court’s account of the\nevidence if it ‘is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.’” Pledger v. United States,\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 9\n\n236 F.3d 315, 320 (6th Cir. 2000) (quoting Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574\n(1985)). We will thus reverse the district court’s interpretation of the evidence “‘only where we\nare left with a definite and firm conviction that [the district court] committed a clear error of\njudgment.’” In re Scrap Metal Antitrust Litig., 527 F.3d 517, 528 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting\nConwood Co., L.P. v. U.S. Tobacco Co., 290 F.3d 768, 781 (6th Cir. 2002)). Consequently, “[i]f\nthe district court interprets the evidence in a manner consistent with the record, we are required\nto uphold its decision even if we would have reached the opposite conclusion.” United States v.\nDarwich, 337 F.3d 645, 663 (6th Cir. 2003).\n\n       Defendants and the General Assembly are unable to show that the district court clearly\nerred by crediting Smith’s statistical conclusions. First, contrary to the General Assembly’s\nclaim, the record does not support a finding that the district court erred because Smith’s\nconclusions are based on faulty data. General Assembly Br. at 48‒51. The district court\nrecognized at the outset of its analysis “that some significant limitations exist regarding the\navailable election data,” including different election management systems and policies for\ntabulating absentee votes among the counties, which made statewide comparisons difficult. R.\n72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 26‒27) (Page ID #5873‒74). Indeed, Smith suggested as much in\nhis expert reports. R. 18-1 (Smith Rep. at 12) (Page ID #173); 53-11 (Smith Rebuttal Rep. at 1‒\n2, 25) (Page ID #1628‒29, 1652).\n\n       Recognizing these limitations, Smith utilized several techniques based on entirely\ndifferent statistical methods and data sources to determine whether the propensity of African\nAmericans to cast EIP ballots in Ohio is greater than whites. See 53-11 (Smith Supp. Rep. at 1‒\n2, 25) (Page ID #1628‒29, 1652). In particular, Smith utilized a “triangulation” method, which\nrelied on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Ohio, and county Boards of Elections, and included\nthree different “standard ecological inference techniques” to analyze voting trends in the 2010\nmidterm and 2012 presidential elections. Id. at 1 (Page ID #1628). Then, in a separate analysis,\nSmith examined data from the Current Population Voting and Registration Supplement to\ndetermine whether African American voters in Ohio were disproportionately more likely to cast\nEIP ballots in the 2012 and 2008 elections based on this data. Id. at 1–2 (Page ID #1628‒29).\nAs the district court found, by varying degrees, each of these examinations supports Smith’s\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                      Page 10\n\nconclusion that African American voters in Ohio utilize EIP voting at higher rates than white\nvoters in recent elections.1\n\n         Smith then supplemented his findings by citing additional studies indicating that African\nAmerican and indigent voters utilized early voting more than white and affluent voters and\nwould be negatively impacted by restrictions on early voting. See, e.g., R. 18-1 (Smith Rep. at 7,\n17, 29–30) (Page ID #168, 178, 190–91); R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 45–46) (Page ID\n#5892–93). These findings are further supported by expert reports submitted by Gronke and\nBurden and studies attached to Plaintiffs’ briefing to the district court.2 See R. 72 (D. Ct. Op.\nand Order at 45–46) (Page ID #5892–93); 53-5 (Gronke Rep. at 6‒12) (Page ID #1563‒69)\n(noting research indicating that African Americans disproportionately use early voting in many\nstates and shortening the early-vote period negatively impacted turnout among African\nAmericans); R. 53-4 (Burden Rep. at 3) (Page ID #1555) (citing research noting that “restrictions\non early voting in Florida finds that it deterred participation of black voters”). Although,\nstanding alone, any one analysis may not have proven dispositive, when reading them together\nand as properly supported by other record evidence, the district court did not clearly err by\ncrediting Smith’s analysis despite the possibility of flaws in the data.\n\n         Second, for the same reason, limitations in Smith’s analysis of the 2010 election do not\ndemonstrate that the district court clearly erred by relying on Smith’s findings.                            General\n\n         1\n           The General Assembly argues that the district court clearly erred because it relied on Smith to find that\nAfrican American voters used EIP voting at “far greater rates” than white voters in Ohio, but Smith himself never\nmade such a claim. General Assembly Br. at 46‒48. Although it is true that Smith never used the phrase “far\ngreater rate,” see, e.g., R. 18-1 (Smith Rep. at 17) (Page ID #178) (finding African Americans used EIP at a “greater\nrate” than whites), he did conclude that in the 2012 election African Americans used EIP voting at a “much higher”\nrate than white voters and characterized his findings as “dramatic.” Id. He further noted the “strong empirical\nevidence” showing that African Americans cast EIP absentee ballots more than whites and do so on the days\neliminated by SB 238 and Directive 2014-06. Id. at 4 (Page ID #165). Based on this, and the additional evidence\nthe district court relied on to support its findings, the district court did not clearly err in its characterization of\nSmith’s conclusions.\n         2\n          Presumably due to the expedited nature of the proceedings, both parties relied on evidence in the form of\nreports by experts and studies cited therein to support their respective positions. See 11A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT,\nARTHUR R. MILLER, & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2949 (3d ed. 2001) (“[I]nasmuch\nas the grant of a preliminary injunction is discretionary, the trial court should be allowed to give even inadmissible\nevidence some weight when it is thought advisable to do so in order to serve the primary purpose of preventing\nirreparable harm before a trial can be had.”); Certified Restoration Dry Cleaning Network, L.L.C. v. Tenke Corp.,\n511 F.3d 535, 542 (6th Cir. 2007) (“Given [its] limited purpose, ‘a preliminary injunction is customarily granted on\nthe basis of procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits.’”)\n(quoting Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981)); Mullins v. City of New York, 626 F.3d 47, 52 (2d\nCir. 2010) (concluding “that hearsay evidence may be considered by a district court in determining whether to grant\na preliminary injunction”).\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.        Page 11\n\nAssembly Br. at 51‒52. Defendants cite the 2010 analysis to show that the early-voting days that\nwere eliminated were among the days with the lowest African American voting rates.\nAppellants Br. at 56. And it is true that Smith’s 2010 analysis considered only data from five of\neighty-eight Ohio counties. But, here, it is Defendants who attempt to cherry-pick the findings.\nAgain, Smith’s analysis of the 2010 mid-term election was one of a number of studies cited by\nthe district court in support of its conclusion that African Americans would be disproportionately\nimpacted by restrictions in EIP voting. Moreover, the five counties analyzed by Smith in his\nfindings based on the 2010 election make up one-third of Ohio’s population and nearly seventy-\nthree percent of all African Americans living in Ohio, and the findings overall indicate that\nAfrican Americans participated in EIP at a higher rate than white voters in these counties. R. 18-\n1 (Smith Rep. at 10) (Page ID #171); R. 53-11 (Smith Rebuttal Rep. at 22) (Page ID #1649).\nThus, the 2010 analysis is certainly relevant to whether African American voters utilized early\nvoting more than white voters, and the district court properly considered this finding along with\nthe other evidence in the record in reaching its conclusion.\n\n       Third, the General Assembly’s suggestion that Smith’s analyses relating to the 2012 and\n2008 elections are not probative here because these were presidential elections and the 2014\nelection is an off-year election is not well-taken. General Assembly Br. at 52‒53. Plaintiffs’\ncomplaint does not limit its challenge to the 2014 midterm elections. See R. 1 (Complaint) (Page\nID #1). Indeed, SB 238 is the law in Ohio and will apply to all elections moving forward, and\nnothing in the record suggests that the restrictions on early voting in Directive 2014-17 will be\nlimited to the 2014 election.     In fact, Directive 2014-17 expressly applies to “Presidential\nGeneral Elections.” R. 18-37 (Directive 2014-17 at 1) (Page ID #532). Thus, any attempt to\ndiminish the probative value of Smith’s 2012 and 2008 election analyses for this reason has no\nmerit. Similarly, attempts to disregard voter turnout among African Americans in the 2012 and\n2008 elections because African American voters were targeted by an African American\npresidential candidate are equally meritless. General Assembly Br. at 53. The suggestion is that\nAfrican American voters in Ohio—a “battleground” state, central to any presidential candidate’s\nchance of winning an election—will not be as heavily targeted in future elections. Id. But this\nclaim is both unsupported by record evidence and, given the continued importance of Ohio in\nnational elections, contrary to common sense. See R. 41-3 (Trende Rep. at 31) (Page ID #1041)\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.        Page 12\n\n(noting that African American voter turnout has risen in Ohio and the United States as a whole\nsince 2004); see also Florida v. United States, 885 F. Supp. 2d 299, 326 (D.D.C. 2012) (“[W]e\ncannot ignore elections in which minority candidates make breakthroughs in winning elected\noffice on the assumption that future elections will revert to the status quo.”).\n\n       Fourth, Defendants and the General Assembly suggest that the district court should not\nhave credited Smith’s analysis because Defendants’ expert, Sean Trende, performed a statistical\nanalysis that produced different results. See Appellants Br. at 56; General Assembly Br. at 52.\nWhile we acknowledge that a Daubert issue is not before us, it remains true that district courts\nplay the role of “gatekeeper” and are charged “with evaluating the relevance and reliability of\nproffered expert testimony with heighted care.” Surles ex rel. Johnson v. Greyhound Lines, Inc.,\n474 F.3d 288, 295 (6th Cir. 2007). For this reason, we generally defer to the district court’s\ndecision to credit one expert over another. In re Scrap Metal, 527 F.3d at 528 (recognizing the\ndeference afforded a district court’s assessment of expert testimony). Moreover, “[w]here there\nare two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be\nclearly erroneous.” Anderson, 470 U.S. at 574.\n\n       Here, Trende analyzed EIP turnout from the 2010 elections and found that, contrary to\nSmith’s conclusion, “it is difficult to conclude that early voting enhances African-American\nturnout.” R. 41-3 (Trende Rep. at 42) (Page ID #1052). He acknowledged, however, that the\n“strength of the relationship tested depends on the judgment call that is made about the different\nvariables.” Id. Indeed, Trende asserted that much of his analysis—as was undoubtedly the case\nfor Smith’s analysis—reflected judgment calls that could “reasonably be argued either way.” Id.\nat 34 (Page ID #1044). The district court’s decision in assessing the evidence to then credit\nSmith’s findings—an academic in the area of electoral processes and election issues, R. 18-1\n(Smith Rep. at 2‒3) (Page ID #163‒64)—and the judgment calls inherent in the same, over\nTrende’s—an elections analyst for the political website RealClearPolitics, who apparently has\nnot conducted a peer-reviewed analysis similar to the one at issue here, R. 41-3 (Trende Rep. at\n3) (Page ID #1013); R. 53-6 (7/30/14 Trende Dep. at 281) (Page ID #1576)—is afforded\ndeference. In re Scrap Metal, 527 F.3d at 528. Given this, along with the multiple methods and\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.           Page 13\n\ndata sources used by Smith and other record evidence corroborating his findings, we conclude\nthat the district court did not clearly err by crediting Smith’s findings over Trende’s.\n\n       Finally, the General Assembly’s claim that the district court erred because Smith’s\nmethodology is flawed also fails. The General Assembly asserts that Smith’s findings are\nunreliable because factors other than race could explain the results of Smith’s census block\nanalysis of the 2012 election, General Assembly Br. at 54‒55; however, no evidence is offered\nsupporting this. Moreover, the other record evidence suggesting that African American voters\nutilize EIP voting at higher rates than white voters indicates that race, rather than some other\nvariable, helps explain Smith’s findings in his 2012 census block analysis. At the least, the\ndistrict court did not clearly err in so finding. See Surles, 474 F.3d at 295 (noting the “broad\ndiscretion” district courts possess to assess the reliability of expert findings); see also McLean v.\n988011 Ontario, Ltd., 224 F.3d 797, 801 (6th Cir. 2000) (“[M]ere ‘weaknesses in the factual\nbasis of an expert witness’ opinion . . . bear on the weight of the evidence rather than on its\nadmissibility.’”) (quoting United States v. L.E. Cooke Co., 991 F.2d 336, 342 (6th Cir. 1993)).\n\n       Similarly, Defendants’ expert, Dr. Nolan McCarty, and Smith quibble over whether\nSmith should have conducted his census block analysis at the county level rather than the\nprecinct level—McCarty claims the results are more accurate at the county level while Smith\nasserts that “aggregat[ing] up . . . dramatically worsens the problem of aggregation bias.”\nCompare R. 53-11 (Smith Rebuttal Rep. at 5‒6) (Page ID # 1632‒33), with General Assembly\nBr. at 55‒56. And the General Assembly claims that the district court gave too much weight to\nthe “direction of the relationship” between African American voters and EIP voting in the 2012\nand 2010 analyses and ignored the “degree of the relationship,” which it claims is small. General\nAssembly Br. at 56‒57. But neither argument supports reversal—again, given the other record\nevidence supporting Smith’s conclusion and the deference afforded the district court, the district\ncourt’s position is plausible based on the record as a whole, and so there is no clear error. King\nv. Zamiara, 680 F.3d 686, 694 (6th Cir. 2012), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 985 (2013) (“If the district\ncourt’s account is ‘plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may\nnot reverse.’”) (quoting Anderson, 470 U.S. at 574).\n\fNo. 14-3877       Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.        Page 14\n\n       Consequently, Defendants and the General Assembly have failed to show that the district\ncourt clearly erred in crediting Smith’s statistical conclusions.\n\nC. Equal Protection Clause Claim\n\n       The right to vote is a “fundamental” right. Harper v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections,\n383 U.S. 663, 670 (1966); Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992) (“It is beyond cavil that\n‘voting is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure.’”) (quoting\nIllinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 184 (1979)). “Other rights,\neven the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.” Wesberry v. Sanders,\n376 U.S. 1, 17 (1964). Moreover, “[t]he right to vote is protected in more than the initial\nallocation of the franchise. Equal protection applies as well to the manner of its exercise.” Bush\nv. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104 (2000); League of Women Voters of Ohio, 548 F.3d at 476 (quoting the\nsame). Two aspects of “the manner of its exercise” warrant special attention: “[t]he Equal\nProtection Clause applies when a state either classifies voters in disparate ways or places\nrestrictions on the right to vote.” Obama for America, 697 F.3d at 428 (emphasis added)\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n       Of course, “the Constitution provides that States may prescribe “‘[t]he Times, Places and\nManner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,’ Art. I § 4, cl. 1, and the Court\ntherefore has recognized that States retain the power to regulate their own elections.” Burdick,\n504 U.S. at 433; Ne. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless v. Husted, 696 F.3d 580, 592 (6th Cir. 2012).\nAnd practically, “there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and\nhonest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the democratic processes.”\nStorer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730 (1974).\n\n       “When equal protection challenges ask us to resolve these competing interests, we\ncalibrate the equal protection standard to ‘[t]he precise character of the state’s action and the\nnature of the burden on voters.’” Ne. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless, 696 F.3d at 592 (quoting\nObama for America, 697 F.3d at 428). State regulations that do not treat similarly situated voters\ndifferently and do not burden the fundamental right to vote are assessed through rational basis\nreview. Obama for America, 697 F.3d at 429; Ne. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless, 696 F.3d at 592.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, strict scrutiny applies to state regulations that impose “severe”\n\fNo. 14-3877     Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.       Page 15\n\nburdens on the fundamental right to vote. Obama for America, 697 F.3d at 429 (citing Harper,\n383 U.S. at 670, and Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434).\n\n       “For the majority of cases falling between these extremes, we apply the ‘flexible’\nAnderson-Burdick balancing test.” Ne. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless, 696 F.3d at 592 (quoting\nObama for America, 697 F.3d at 429). The Anderson-Burdick test provides as follows:\n\n       A court considering a challenge to a state election law must weigh “the character\n       and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and\n       Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate” against “the precise\n       interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its\n       rule,” taking into consideration “the extent to which those interests make it\n       necessary to burden the plaintiffs’ rights.”\n\nBurdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (quoting Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1983)). “There is\nno ‘litmus test’ to separate valid from invalid voting regulations; courts must weigh the burden\non voters against the state’s asserted justifications and ‘make the “hard judgment” that our\nadversary system demands.’” Obama for America, 697 F.3d at 429 (quoting Crawford v. Marion\nCnty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 190 (2008) (Stevens, J., announcing the judgment of the\nCourt)). Even a minimal burden “must be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests\n‘sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.’” Crawford, 553 U.S. at 191 (quoting Norman v.\nReed, 502 U.S. 279, 288–89 (1992)).\n\n       The district court “characterize[d] the overall degree of burden on voting imposed by SB\n238 and Directive 2014-17 as significant although not severe.” R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at\n53) (Page ID #5900). Focusing on SB 238, the district court found that its elimination of\n“Golden Week” burdened African American and low-income voters in two ways. Id. at 50 (Page\nID #5897). First, SB 238 in conjunction with Directive 2014-17 reduced the overall number of\nEIP voting days from 35 to 28 days. The district court noted evidence in the record that 67,408\nOhioans voted in 2008 during Golden Week; 26,230 did so in 2010; and 89,224 voters did so in\n2012. Id. The district court also credited statistical and survey analysis by Plaintiffs’ expert\nSmith that African American voters in Ohio have higher EIP voting rates than white voters, and\nthat African American voters in the 2008, 2010, and 2012 elections “disproportionately cast EIP\nabsentee ballots on days that would have been eliminated by SB 238 and Directive 2014-06.” R.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 16\n\n72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 32, 50) (Page ID #5879, 5897); R. 18-1 (Smith Rep. at 31) (Page ID\n#192). The district court cited four other statistical studies in the record on racial early-voting\npatterns in Ohio that it found supported Smith’s conclusions. Id. at 45–46 (Page ID #5892–93).\n\n       Second, the district court concluded that the elimination of Golden Week “burdens the\nvoting rights of lower income and homeless individuals” because the record reflected that such\nindividuals “move frequently” as well as “lack access to transportation,” which combine to make\nit harder for such individuals to maintain accurate registration. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at\n51) (Page ID #5898). Thus, the ability to register and vote on the same day “can make the\ndifference between being able to exercise the fundamental right to vote and not being able to do\nso.” Id. The court pointed to evidence in the record that 12,842 voters used Golden Week to\nregister or update their registration and vote in 2008; 1,651 voters did so in 2010; and\n5,844 voters did so in 2012. Id.\n\n       Turning to Directive 2014-17, the district court found that it burdened African American\nand lower-income voters by eliminating all evening voting hours for non-presidential elections\nand by providing only one Sunday of EIP voting, the Sunday before Election Day. Id. at 51–53\n(Page ID #5898–5900). The district court noted that the record reflected that lower-income\nvoters are “more likely to rely on public transportation and work wage-based jobs wherein they\nare less likely” to be able to vote between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. at the one early-voting location\npermitted in each county, which might be a great distance away. Id. at 53 (Page ID #5900).\nRegarding the elimination of all but one Sunday of EIP voting, the court pointed to evidence in\nthe record that since the instatement of EIP voting, African Americans have come to rely on\nSunday voting through “Souls to the Polls initiatives,” in which churches have leveraged the\ntransportation they already provide to and from church to bring voters to EIP voting locations.\nId. at 52 (Page ID #5899). Souls to the Polls organizers reported that, during the one permitted\nday of Sunday voting during the 2012 general election, there were long lines of mainly African\nAmerican voters. Id. While the district court acknowledged that Souls to the Polls organizers\ncould switch to the two Saturdays that are still designated EIP voting days under Directive 2014-\n17, the court concluded that this would still impose “some burden” because churches are already\norganized to provide transportation on Sundays. Id. at 53 (Page ID #5900).\n\fNo. 14-3877       Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.       Page 17\n\n       Therefore, because the district court found that the burden imposed on Plaintiffs was\n“significant,” it proceeded to apply the Anderson-Burdick test to SB 238 and Directive 2014-17.\nR. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 55) (Page ID #5902).\n\n       Defendants argue that rational basis review, rather than the Anderson-Burdick test, is the\nproper standard of review for two reasons. First, they argue that “[t]he ‘right to vote’ has never\nincluded the ‘right to receive absentee ballots.’” Appellants Br. at 18 (quoting McDonald v. Bd.\nof Election Comm’rs of Chicago, 394 U.S. 802, 807 (1969)). Second, Defendants argue that\nwhen a facially neutral voting law is at issue, as SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 are, the Supreme\nCourt in Crawford held that Anderson-Burdick applies only if the law “severely burdens the right\nto vote of the general class of state voters.” Id. at 19. Otherwise, Defendants assert that\ntraditional Equal Protection Clause principles govern—which require proof of discriminatory\nintent—and Plaintiffs have not established that either SB 238 or Directive 2014-17 was adopted\nwith discriminatory intent. Id. at 19, 27. Finally, if Anderson-Burdick review does apply,\nDefendants argue that the district court improperly determined that the burden imposed on voters\nrepresented by Plaintiffs is “significant.” Id. at 31.\n\n1. The District Court Properly Applied Anderson-Burdick Review\n\n       We addressed Defendants’ first argument regarding McDonald in Obama for America.\n697 F.3d 423. In McDonald, the Supreme Court did not apply rational basis review to the\nchallenged Illinois statute allowing only certain categories of voters to receive absentee ballots\nsolely because absentee ballots were at issue. Rather,\n\n       [t]he McDonald plaintiffs failed to make out a claim for heightened scrutiny\n       because they had presented no evidence to support their allegation that they were\n       being prevented from voting. See O’Brien v. Skinner, 414 U.S. 524, 529 (1974)\n       (“Essentially the Court’s disposition of the claims in McDonald rested on failure\n       of proof.”); Goosby v. Osser, 409 U.S. 512, 520–22 [(1973)] (finding that\n       McDonald itself suggested a different result if plaintiffs had presented evidence\n       that the state was effectively preventing them from voting).\n\nObama for America, 697 F.3d at 431 (emphasis added).\n\n       Thus, in Obama for America, we held that the district court properly applied the\nAnderson-Burdick balancing test, rather than rational basis review, to evaluate whether the\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.           Page 18\n\nchallenged Directive’s elimination of early in-person voting for the three days immediately\npreceding Election Day violated the Equal Protection Clause. Id. Unlike the plaintiffs in\nMcDonald, we noted that “Plaintiffs introduced extensive evidence that a significant number of\nOhio voters will in fact be precluded from voting without the additional three days of in-person\nearly voting.” Id. This evidence included “statistical studies that estimated approximately\n100,000 Ohio voters would choose to vote during the three-day period before Election Day, and\nthat these voters are disproportionately ‘women, older, and of lower income and education\nattainment,’” groups which the plaintiffs represented.        Id. (internal citation omitted).   The\ndefendants in that case also argued that the plaintiffs would not actually be precluded from\nvoting as required by McDonald because they had “ample” other means of voting, including by\nmail, voting EIP at other times, or on Election Day. Id. However, we held not clearly erroneous\nthe district court’s conclusion that early voters would not be able to exercise their right to vote in\nperson because the challenged Directive also eliminated all evening and weekend hours of EIP\nvoting, times during which early voters would likely have voted in the past because they tend to\nhave lower incomes and less education than election day voters. Id.\n\n       We did not read McDonald to require proof that there was no possibility that the\nplaintiffs would find a way to adjust and vote through the remaining options. We acknowledged\nthat the challenged law “does not absolutely prohibit early voters from voting,” but focused on\nthe evidence in the record that the plaintiffs’ “ability to cast a ballot is impeded by Ohio’s\nstatutory scheme.” Id. at 433. To the extent that McDonald spoke in terms of “precluding” an\nindividual from voting, which might imply the necessity of such proof, we note that McDonald\nwas decided before the development of the Anderson-Burdick test. Thus, the McDonald Court\napplied a two-tier test for evaluating restrictions on the right to vote, rational basis review for no\nburdens and strict scrutiny for “severe” burdens, a threshold that more clearly invites\nconsideration of “preclusion.” However, as noted above, that two-tier test has evolved into the\nAnderson-Burdick framework, under which burdens that fall between those two extremes can\nstill be found to violate the Equal Protection Clause. In more recent cases, the Supreme Court\nhas not required absolute certainty in predicting how many voters would be prevented from\nvoting by laws that impose burdens on the right to vote. See, e.g., Crawford, 553 U.S. at 221\n(Souter, J., dissenting) (stating that “Petitioners, to be sure, failed to nail down precisely how\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                       Page 19\n\ngreat the cohort of discouraged and totally deterred voters will be, but empirical precision\nbeyond the foregoing numbers has never been demanded for raising a voting-rights claim.” and\nciting Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 461–62\n(2008) (Roberts, C. J., concurring) (“Nothing in my analysis requires the parties to produce\nstudies regarding voter perceptions on this score”); Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 335 n.5\n(1972) (“[I]t would be difficult to determine precisely how many would-be voters throughout the\ncountry cannot vote because of durational residence requirements.”); and Bullock v. Carter,\n405 U.S. 134, 144 (1972) (taking account of “the obvious likelihood” that candidate filing fees\nwould “fall more heavily on the less affluent segment of the community, whose favorites may be\nunable to pay the large costs”)). Thus, in this case the district court properly held that whether\nvoters might adjust to vote during a different time in EIP voting such that overall turnout might\nnot be affected “is not determinative of the Equal Protection analysis.” R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and\nOrder at 50) (Page ID #5897).3\n\n         Like the plaintiffs in Obama for America, Plaintiffs in this case presented ample evidence\nthat African American, lower-income, and homeless voters disproportionately have used in past\nelections the EIP voting times that Directive 2014-17 and SB 238 eliminated, and that the\nnumber of individuals who had previously voted during these periods was not insignificant. For\nexample, the number of voters in Golden Week alone ranged from 26,230 in 2010 to 89,224 in\n2012. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 50) (Page ID #5897). And the regulations at issue in the\ncase reduce the overall time for EIP voting more than the three days that had been eliminated in\nObama for America. Moreover, unlike the plaintiffs in Obama for America, Plaintiffs also\npresented evidence to show that voting by mail is not actually a viable “alternative means of\naccess to the ballot” for the groups they represent. Cf. Obama for America, 697 F.3d at 440\n\n         3\n           In a relatively recent case, the Second Circuit considered a claim that a New York statute allowing\nabsentee voting for all elections except elections for political party county committees violated the First Amendment\nby impermissibly burdening New York citizens’ right to vote. Price v. New York State Bd. of Elections, 540 F.3d\n101, 103-04 (2d Cir. 2008). The district court had analyzed the statute under rational basis review, citing\nMcDonald, but the Second Circuit held that the law should have been analyzed under the Anderson-Burdick\nbalancing test. Id. at 108-09 (“The defendants assert that pure rational basis review should be utilized in this case in\nreviewing the constitutionality of Election Law § 7–122. They are incorrect. Under Burdick’s ‘flexible standard,’\nthe court must actually ‘weigh’ the burdens imposed on the plaintiff against ‘the precise interests put forward by the\nState,’ and the court must take ‘into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the\nplaintiff’s rights.’”) (internal citation omitted) (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789).\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                      Page 20\n\n(White, J., concurring) (noting that the study in the record “did not consider the extent to which\nthese voters would or could avail themselves of other voting options, either by mail ballot or in-\nperson absentee ballot at other times, or in-person voting on election day.”) (emphasis added).\nThe district court noted that “the record is undisputed that African Americans, lower-income\nindividuals, and the homeless are distrustful of the mail and/or voting by mail.” R. 72 (D. Ct.\nOp. and Order at 54) (Page ID #5901). Additionally, the district court considered the fact that\n“[t]he associated costs and more complex mechanics of voting by mail, coupled with other\ninformation in the record concerning the enumerated groups including homelessness, lower\neducational attainment, more limited financial resources, reliance on public transportation, and\ntransience” to bolster its conclusion that “voting by mail may not be a suitable alternative for\nmany voters.” Id. The record also reflected that lower-income voters, because of their reliance\non public transportation and higher likelihood of working in wage-based jobs, would face\nsubstantial difficulties in voting between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Id. at 53 (Page ID #5900). Under\nObama for America, then, the district court properly concluded that Plaintiffs had presented\nsufficient evidence that the groups they represent are in fact significantly burdened by Directive\n2014-17 and SB 238 such that McDonald’s rational basis standard does not apply.4\n\n2. Crawford Does Not Foreclose Applying Anderson-Burdick Review\n\n         In Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, we squarely addressed the applicability of\nAnderson-Burdick to facially neutral restrictions on voting. 696 F.3d 580. The State defendant\nin that case argued that the challenged practice—“Ohio’s automatic disqualification rule for\nwrong-precinct ballots”—“treats all voters equally and therefore does not involve any\n\n\n         4\n          To the extent that the district court relied on Judge White’s concurrence in Obama for America and Bush\nv. Gore as a separate rationale for its decision, see id. at 49–50 (Page ID #5896–97), we first note that that analysis\nis not necessary to our holding that the district court properly did not apply McDonald’s rational basis standard of\nreview. At the same time, we do think the broader context in which Ohio statutorily imposed EIP voting—as a\nremedial measure to address such long lines for voting in 2004 that many voters simply gave up trying to vote—is\nrelevant as additional evidence suggesting that voters whom Plaintiffs represent may not in fact easily adjust to\nvoting on Election Day if SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 were to remain in effect. Moreover, while Bush v. Gore\ndid involve disparate treatment, rather than burdens on the fundamental right to vote, we nonetheless find its\nmotivating principle instructive in the present case given that the Equal Protection Clause can be triggered by either\ndisparate treatment or burdens. That is, “[h]aving once granted the right to vote on equal terms”—such as\nexpanding early voting opportunities—“the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one\nperson’s vote over that of another”—for example, by making it substantially harder for certain groups to vote than\nothers. Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. at 104–05.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 21\n\nclassification that could violate the equal protection standard.” Id. at 592 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In responding to this argument, we explained that\n\n       [T]he State overlooks the fact that a clear majority of the Supreme Court in\n       Crawford applied some form of Burdick’s burden-measuring equal protection\n       standard to Indiana’s facially neutral voter-identification requirement. See\n       553 U.S. at 189–91 (Stevens, J., announcing the judgment of the Court), 204\n       (Scalia, J., joined by Alito and Thomas, JJ., concurring in the judgment) (“To\n       evaluate a law respecting the right to vote—whether it governs voter\n       qualifications, candidate selection, or the voting process—we use the approach set\n       out in Burdick. . . .”), 211 (Souter, J., dissenting).\n\nId. Because the plaintiffs in that case had “‘demonstrated that their right to vote is . . . burdened\nby Ohio’s law that rejects wrong-precinct ballots regardless of poll-worker error,” we held that\n“[t]he Anderson-Burdick standard . . . applies.” Id. (quoting Obama for America, 697 F.3d at\n430); see also Obama for America, 697 F.3d at 428–29 (stating that the “[t]he Equal Protection\nClause applies when a state either classifies voters in disparate ways or places restrictions on the\nright to vote”) (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). However, as the plaintiffs in\nNortheast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless asserted that the law at issue created a burden on\nprovisional voters generally, rather than on a subclass of provisional voters, we did not address\nDefendants’ more specific argument here that Anderson-Burdick requires a showing of a burden\non voters generally.\n\n       Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, a majority of the Court in Crawford did not expressly\nhold that a challenger must demonstrate that a voting restriction burdens voters generally in order\nto trigger scrutiny under Anderson-Burdick.          The opinion authored by Justice Stevens\nannouncing the judgment of the Court, which gained only two other votes, did not explicitly\nreject the petitioners’ argument that the middle level of scrutiny under the Anderson-Burdick\nbalancing test could be triggered by evidence of burdens on a subgroup of voters, instead of all\nvoters; rather, the Court held that “on the basis of the evidence in the record it is not possible to\nquantify either the magnitude of the burden on this narrow class of voters or the portion of the\nburden imposed on them that is fully justified.” Crawford, 553 U.S. at 200; see also id. at 202\n(“In sum, on the basis of the record that has been made in this litigation, we cannot conclude that\nthe statute imposes ‘excessively burdensome requirements’ on any class of voters.”) (emphasis\nadded) (citation omitted). Thus, Justice Stevens weighed the evidence of minimal burdens of the\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.           Page 22\n\nlaw on voters generally, the vast majority of whom had IDs, and found that burden justified by\nthe state’s interests. Id. at 202. In contrast, Justice Scalia’s concurrence, which two other\nJustices joined, expressly would have required the plaintiffs to demonstrate that voters generally\nwere burdened for the Anderson-Burdick balancing test to apply. Id. at 205–06 (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring). Justice Scalia cited decisions of the Court outside of the elections context holding\nthat a generally applicable law does not violate the Equal Protection Clause when it merely\ndisproportionately burdens a subgroup of people absent evidence of discriminatory intent. Id. at\n207–08. Justice Souter’s dissent, joined by Justice Ginsburg, assumed that Anderson-Burdick\nbalancing could be triggered by burdens on subgroups, and disagreed with Justice Stevens that\nthe petitioners had not presented sufficient evidence of a more than minimal burden on the\nsubgroup of voters they represented. Id. at 237 (Souter, J., dissenting).\n\n       Thus, a majority of the justices in Crawford either did not expressly reject or in fact\nendorsed the idea that a burden on only a subgroup of voters could trigger balancing review\nunder Anderson-Burdick. Alternatively, as the narrowest basis of the judgment of the Court,\nJustice Stevens’s opinion may be viewed as “the holding of the Court” given the “fragmented”\nCrawford opinions. See, e.g., Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977) (“When a\nfragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of\nfive Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members\nwho concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBoth Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia held that the Indiana law was constitutional, but Justice\nScalia reached further and held that challengers to a voting restriction must show that it burdens\nvoters generally. Thus, Justice Stevens’s opinion is narrower. See Frank v. Walker, --- F. Supp.\n2d ----, No. 11-CV-01128, 2014 WL 1775432, at *4 (E.D. Wis. Apr. 29, 2014) (holding that\nJustice Stevens’s opinion in Crawford is the narrower ground for the opinion under Marks).\nFinally, it is worth noting that in Anderson, the Supreme Court in fact assessed the burden\nimposed by the challenged law by looking to its impact on a subgroup of voters. Anderson,\n460 U.S. at 792 (holding that “[i]t is clear, then, that the March filing deadline places a particular\nburden on an identifiable segment of Ohio’s independent-minded voters,” specifically\nAnderson’s supporters, but not assessing whether the deadline burdens all voters).\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                      Page 23\n\n         Therefore, that Plaintiffs presented evidence only of SB 238 and Directive 2014-17’s\nburdens on African American, lower-income, and homeless voters does not automatically mean\nthat only rational basis review or standard Equal Protection Clause analysis applies. Crawford\nmerely stands for the proposition that Plaintiffs must present more evidence than the petitioners\ndid in that case to show that the subgroups of voters they represent are more than minimally\nburdened.\n\n         As discussed previously, Plaintiffs presented extensive statistical, survey, and anecdotal\nevidence that SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 will disproportionately burden the ability of African\nAmerican, lower-income, and homeless individuals to vote. The petitioners in Crawford had not\npresented any evidence in the record that even estimated the number of individuals who lacked\nidentification cards. Crawford, 553 U.S. at 200. Nor did the affidavits or depositions in the\nrecord of lower-income individuals or elderly voters in Crawford substantiate that they in fact\nfaced difficulties in obtaining identification cards.              Id. at 201.      In contrast, Plaintiffs here\npresented statistical and survey evidence that indicated that thousands of individuals whom they\nrepresent had voted in past elections during the times that have been eliminated by SB 238 and\nDirective 2014-17, as well as numerous depositions, affidavits, and expert testimony\ndocumenting that the groups Plaintiffs represent have relied on the eliminated EIP voting times\nand would face difficulties in voting without them.5\n\n         In sum, we hold that the district court’s characterization of the overall burden imposed by\nSB 238 and Directive 2014-17 as significant, but not severe, was not clearly erroneous given the\nextensive evidence in the record of the burdens African American, lower-income, and homeless\nvoters will face in voting, absent the times eliminated by SB 238 and Directive 2014-17.6 It\n\n         5\n           The other cases Defendants cite as supporting its argument that the burdens in this case are not significant\nare easily distinguishable. The Seventh Circuit considered the claim of “working mothers” seeking the right to vote\nabsentee in Griffin v. Roupas with nothing more than a complaint before it because of the procedural posture of the\ncase. 385 F.3d 1128 (7th Cir. 2004). The plaintiffs in Common Cause/Georgia v. Billups “failed to identify a single\nindividual who would be unable to vote because of the Georgia statute or who would face an undue burden to obtain\na free voter identification card.” 554 F.3d 1340, 1354 (11th Cir. 2009). Of course, the best comparison to the\npresent case for evaluating burdens is Obama for America, and as we discussed above, Plaintiffs in this case\npresented even more evidence than the plaintiffs in that case did to substantiate their claim that the voting rights of\ngroups they represent are in fact significantly burdened by SB 238 and Directive 2014-17.\n         6\n          Defendants assert in their Reply Brief that “Plaintiffs identify no case that treats the ultimate finding of\nwhether a burden is severe (and subject to strict scrutiny), significant (and subject to intermediate scrutiny), or\nminimal (and subject to rational-basis review) as one appropriate for fact-finding.” Appellants Reply Br. at 6. In\nfact, in Obama for America, we did precisely that:\n\fNo. 14-3877        Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                      Page 24\n\ntherefore properly applied the Anderson-Burdick balancing test. We next turn to the district\ncourt’s evaluation of Defendants’ asserted justifications for SB 238 and Directive 2014-17.\n\n3. The State’s Justifications Do Not Outweigh the Significant Burden on Voters\n\n        Once a court has determined that a law burdens voters, under Anderson-Burdick those\nburdens must be weighed against “the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications\nfor the burden imposed by its rule,” taking into consideration “the extent to which those interests\nmake it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.” Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789 (emphasis added).\nPut differently, the state must articulate specific, rather than abstract state interests, and explain\nwhy the particular restriction imposed is actually necessary, meaning it actually addresses, the\ninterest put forth. See Obama for America, 697 F.3d at 433–34 (assessing under Anderson-\nBurdick whether the state had presented actual evidence to support the justifications it provided\nfor the challenged law).\n\n        Before even articulating these interests, Defendants appear to argue that we held in\nObama for America that a law such as SB 238 or Directive 2014-17 would automatically survive\nthis scrutiny of state interests. Appellants Br. at 21 (quoting our statement in Obama for\nAmerica, 697 F.3d at 433–34, that “If the State had enacted a generally applicable,\nnondiscriminatory voting regulation that limited in-person early voting for all Ohio voters, its\n‘important regulatory interests’ would likely be sufficient to justify the restriction.’”). That\nstatement, of course, was not central to our holding in that case and does not control the present\ncase. Moreover, the quoted language in that sentence is in fact from Burdick. 504 U.S. at 434\n(stating that “when [a regulation] imposes only ‘reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions’ upon\n[voting rights], the State’s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the\nrestrictions”) (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788). The key in that statement is the word\n\n\n        The State argues that the burden on non-military voters is slight because they have “ample” other\n        means to cast their ballots, including by requesting and mailing an absentee ballot, voting in\n        person prior to the final weekend before Election Day, or on Election Day itself. However, the\n        district court concluded that because early voters have disproportionately lower incomes and less\n        education than election day voters, and because all evening and weekend voting hours prior to the\n        final weekend were eliminated by Directive 2012–35, “thousands of voters who would have voted\n        during those three days will not be able to exercise their right to cast a vote in person.” Based on\n        the evidence in the record, this conclusion was not clearly erroneous.\nObama for America, 697 F.3d at 431 (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted).\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.           Page 25\n\ngenerally; the Burdick Court was merely making clear that not all restrictions on voting will be\nstruck down simply because they impose any kind of burden, as states do have the power to\nregulate elections generally. Burdick itself involved a nondiscriminatory restriction on write-in\nvoting, and the Court still probed the state’s asserted justifications for the restriction in the\nmanner required by Anderson. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434. Indeed, in a more recent case, the\nSupreme Court has tied this statement’s applicability to situations in which the burden imposed\nis modest. Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 452\n(2008) (“If a statute imposes only modest burdens, however, then ‘the State’s important\nregulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions’\non election procedures.”) (emphasis added) (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788).\n\n       We also note that how Ohio’s early-voting system compares to that of other states is not\nrelevant under the Anderson-Burdick balancing test. The test directs courts to weigh the burdens\nimposed on voters in a particular state against the justifications that that state has proffered for\nthe challenged law or practice that imposes those burdens. Early voting does not necessarily\nplay the same role in all jurisdictions in ensuring that certain groups of voters are actually able to\nvote. Thus, the same law may impose a significant burden in one state and only a minimal\nburden in another. Similarly, a particular state may have stronger justifications for a law that\nburdens voters than other states with the same law.\n\n       Thus, we will examine in turn each of Defendants’ asserted justifications—preventing\nvoter fraud and containing costs for SB 238, and uniformity for Directive 2014-17—under the\nAnderson-Burdick balancing framework.\n\ni. Fraud\n\n       Regarding SB 238, Defendants argue that it is necessary as a measure to reduce fraud\narising from same-day registration and voting during Golden Week. Appellants Br. at 26;\nGeneral Assembly Br. at 38. Defendants point to the testimony by the OAEO Director that the\n“‘registration deadline’ exists so officials ‘can confirm that a voter is who they say they are\nbefore they cast a ballot.’” Id. at 26 (citing R. 54-4 (Keeran Decl. at 7) (Page ID #1851)).\nDefendants assert that “[w]hen the deadline is later than the start of voting, votes might be\ncounted even though cast ‘by people who fraudulently registered during this period, because the\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 26\n\nelection officials could not confirm their registration status before Election Day.’” Id. The Ohio\nGeneral Assembly points to declarations of individual county election officials that “historically\nvoter fraud was most likely to occur during Golden Week,” R. 68-2 (Ward Decl. ¶ 4) (Page ID\n#5123), or that it is difficult to verify an individual’s residence when someone registers and votes\non the same day, R. 68-3 (Cuckler Decl. ¶ 9) (Page ID #5511), or that some individuals were\nable to cast absentee ballots in one county and then register and cast an EIP Ballot during Golden\nWeek in another county, id. ¶ 8 (Page ID #5510–11). They argue that the Crawford Court\nconsidered similar evidence regarding fraud to hold that the state’s interest in that case was\nsufficiently important to outweigh burdens on voters. Finally, the General Assembly argues that\nthe district court “trivialized or ignored this unrefuted evidence” and improperly substituted its\nown judgment about how fraud from absentee voting could be “best” handled.                 General\nAssembly Br. at 41.\n\n       Weighing the state’s asserted interest in preventing voter fraud against the significant\nburden the elimination of Golden Week places on Plaintiffs, we conclude that Defendants have\nnot met their burden to establish that their interests outweigh these burdens. To be sure, “[t]here\nis no question about the legitimacy or importance of the State’s interest in counting only the\nvotes of eligible voters. . . . While the most effective method of preventing election fraud may\nwell be debatable, the propriety of doing so is perfectly clear.” Crawford, 553 U.S. at 196. This\ndoes not mean, however, that the State can, by merely asserting an interest in preventing voter\nfraud, establish that that interest outweighs a significant burden on voters. Defendants did not\nprovide more than a handful of actual examples of voter fraud, and their general testimony\nregarding the difficulties of verifying voter registration before counting ballots did not clearly\npertain to problems with Golden Week specifically. The district court properly identified that the\nspecific concern Defendants expressed regarding voter fraud—that the vote of an EIP voter\nwould be counted before his or her registration could be verified—was not logically linked to\nconcerns with voting and registering on the same day, but rather “has more to do with the\nregistration process and verification of absentee ballots” generally. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order\nat 56) (Page ID #5903). The court explained that, since Ohio law requires that officials segregate\nabsentee ballots and not count them until registration is verified, see, e.g., R. 53-10 (Directive\n2012-36) (Page ID #1625‒26); R. 58-16 (Clyde Dec. ¶ 16) (Page ID #2169), there is no reason to\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                     Page 27\n\nthink that the registration of voters who registered and voted on the same day during Golden\nWeek would be any harder to verify than an individual who registered on the last permissible day\nand then voted the next day, or for that matter than someone who voted very close to the\nelection. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 56) (Page ID #5903). Defendants did not explain why it\nis harder to segregate and count later the absentee ballots of individuals who vote and register on\nthe same day as opposed to segregating absentee ballots that are returned a different way,\nparticularly given that officials would have at least 30 days to verify the registration of those who\nregister and vote during Golden Week.                 Thus, the district court properly concluded that\nDefendants did not meet their burden of explaining why eliminating Golden Week serves to\nprevent a “precise” problem of voter fraud in a way that is “necessary” to burden the voters\nPlaintiffs’ represent, as opposed to a measure that might more directly target the asserted\nproblem without burdening voters. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789.7\n\n        Moreover, the General Assembly’s argument that Crawford suggests it sufficiently met\nits burden to demonstrate that its interest in fraud prevention outweighs the significant burden on\nPlaintiffs is misplaced. The Crawford Court did not hold that scattered historical examples of\nvoter fraud necessarily establish a sufficient state interest to overcome any burden imposed on\nvoters; given the simply minimal burden that the petitioners had shown on voters in that case, the\nCourt essentially only engaged in a rational basis review of the state’s asserted interest in\npreventing voter fraud, not the more piercing scrutiny that a greater burden would require under\nAnderson-Burdick. Crawford, 553 U.S. at 194–96, 202. Here, in contrast, the district court\nconcluded that the burden on Plaintiffs was significant. Thus, its more searching review of\nDefendants’ asserted justification in preventing voter fraud was warranted.\n\n\n\n\n        7\n           While we do not find that other states’ electoral laws and practices are relevant to our assessment of the\nconstitutionality or legality of SB 238 and Directive 2014-17, we note that Defendants’ own expert Professor\nMcCarty reported that “Ohio is quite an outlier” with regard to its registration deadline. R. 67-1 (McCarty Rebuttal\nRep. at 22) (Page ID #5088). He continues that “[i]n every state except New Mexico, a voter can register and vote\nwithin 15 days of the election. In most cases, this can be accomplished within a week of the election. Ohio and\nNew Mexico are apples to these oranges.” Id. Thus, other states do not appear to be overly concerned with voter\nfraud arising from allowing voters to register even closer to Election Day than Ohio allows.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 28\n\nii. Cost\n\n       Defendants next argue that SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 are necessary as cost\ncontainment measures. They argue that increasing EIP voting would “increase the costs and\nadministrative burdens” on Election Boards, such as requiring additional staff. Appellants Br. at\n25. Defendants also assert that they determined the days and times to eliminate strategically so\nas “to be more efficient with our tax payer dollars” because “[a] relatively smaller proportion of\nvoters . . . voted during the times Ohio eliminated, compared to the times it kept.” Id. at 25. The\nOhio General Assembly adds that the district court improperly dismissed the specific cost\nestimates of retaining EIP voting provided by several local election officials simply because they\n“lack[ed] a frame of reference” and ignored less easily quantifiable burdens of Election Boards\n“having to divert manpower” away from other tasks to administering EIP voting. General\nAssembly Br. at 45. They argue that they did not need to show that they could not handle the\ncosts of the old system, as the district court suggested. Id.\n\n       We also conclude that Defendants’ asserted interest in reducing costs does not adequately\njustify the burdens SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 place on voters. In Obama for America, we\nheld that the State’s asserted interest in reducing costs and administrative burdens did not justify\nthe burdens on voters because there was “no evidence that local boards of elections have\nstruggled to cope with early voting in the past, no evidence that they may struggle to do so\nduring the November 2012 election,” and because at least one local board, Cuyahoga County,\nsaid it had budgeted for EIP voting. 697 F.3d at 433–34. Our focus on whether local boards\nwould “struggle” to handle costs in Obama for America makes clear that it is not enough merely\nto assert that a restriction on voting saves costs. Arguably some cost-saving rationale could be\nidentified in most voting restrictions. Rather, where more than minimal burdens on voters are\nestablished, the State must demonstrate that such costs would actually be burdensome.\n\n       The district court thus properly concluded that Defendants had not demonstrated that they\nwould “struggle” with the costs of maintaining EIP voting. While Defendants presented specific\ncost estimates from a handful of election boards for reinstating Golden Week, the district court\nproperly noted that those figures “lack[ed] a frame of reference” in that Defendants did not\nindicate whether or how those costs would be burdensome overall. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order\n\fNo. 14-3877       Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 29\n\nat 57) (Page ID #5904). Cuyahoga County again filed an amicus brief saying it had already\nbudgeted money for Golden Week and the additional weekend voting days for the 2014 election.\nR. 28 (Am. Cur. Br. Cuyahoga Cnty. at 8–9) (Page ID #600‒01). Nor did Defendants present\nspecific estimates of the costs of maintaining the eliminated days of weekend voting. The\ndistrict court also pointed to evidence in the record that election boards are required by law to be\nopen during Golden Week, and only five of the eighty-eight counties statewide ran EIP voting at\nsites other than their regular offices during the 2008 and 2010 elections. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and\nOrder at 59) (Page ID #5906). Thus, the court reasonably concluded that most election boards\nwould not have to bear substantial extra costs associated with maintaining an offsite location for\nthat period. Id. Moreover, like the State in Obama for America, Defendants did not present\nevidence that the old EIP voting schedule, which included Golden Week and weekend voting,\n“created undue or burdensome costs.” Id. at 58 (Page ID #5905).\n\niii. Uniformity\n\n       Finally, regarding Directive 2014-17, Defendants justify it as necessary to promote\nuniformity. Appellants Br. at 24. Defendants argue that “uniformity makes it easier for the State\nto educate voters about election days and hours.” Id. It also ensures fairness by making sure that\nall voters can vote during the same times across counties. Id. And Defendants argue it reduces\nlitigation risks by ensuring equal treatment of voters. Id.\n\n       Again, we conclude this asserted interest fails to outweigh the burdens on Plaintiffs.\nDefendants present only an abstract interest in uniformity that is not tied to the necessity of SB\n238 and Directive 2014-17 specifically. Uniformity can be important to make voter education\neasier, but Defendants do not explain why a uniform EIP voting schedule could not also include\nGolden Week and the other eliminated EIP voting times.            As the district court explained,\n“uniformity, standing alone,” is not an interest important enough to significantly burden\nPlaintiffs’ ability to vote. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 60) (Page ID #5907); see also Obama\nfor America, 697 F.3d at 442 (White, J., concurring) (“The desire for uniformity has little to do\nwith the elimination of all weekend and after-hours in-person voting. Defendants offer no\nexplanation for curtailing hours other than on the final weekend, and uniformity without some\nunderlying reason for the chosen rule is not a justification in and of itself. Nor is there a showing\n\fNo. 14-3877        Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                   Page 30\n\nthat eliminating all weekend and after-hours voting will in fact produce uniform access, as\nopposed to uniform hours.”).\n\n        In sum, because we have concluded that none of the interests put forth by Defendants\nsufficiently justify the significant burden that the district court found SB 238 and Directive 2014-\n17 place on the voters whom Plaintiffs represent, we find that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on\ntheir Equal Protection Clause claim.\n\nD. Voting Rights Act Section 2 Claim\n\n        Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973,8 provides that “[n]o voting\nqualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or\napplied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement\nof the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . .”\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(a). In 1982, Congress amended the Voting Rights Act to make clear that\n“Section 2, unlike other federal legislation that prohibits racial discrimination, does not require\nproof of discriminatory intent. Instead, a plaintiff need show only that the challenged action or\nrequirement has a discriminatory effect on members of a protected group.” Moore v. Detroit\nSch. Reform Bd., 293 F.3d 352, 363 (6th Cir. 2002); see also Mixon v. Ohio, 193 F.3d 389, 407\n(6th Cir. 1999) (“Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires only a showing of discriminatory\neffect.”). Section 2(b) sets out the test for determining whether a challenged practice violates\nSection 2(a):\n\n        A violation of subsection (a) of this section is established if, based on the totality\n        of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or\n        election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation\n        by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) of this section in that\n        its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to\n        participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).\n\n\n\n\n        8\n         The Voting Rights Act recently was transferred to 52 U.S.C. § 10301 et seq. We use its prior placement at\n42 U.S.C. § 1973 for the purposes of this opinion.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 31\n\n       In Thornburg v. Gingles, the Supreme Court endorsed nine factors, first listed in the\nSenate Judiciary Committee report for the 1982 amendments to Section 2 (referred to as the\n“Senate factors”), as relevant to assessing “the totality of the circumstances” in Section 2(b):\n\n       1. the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state or political\n          subdivision that touched the right of the members of the minority group to\n          register, to vote, or otherwise to participate in the democratic process;\n       2. the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision\n          is racially polarized;\n       3. the extent to which the state or political subdivision has used unusually large\n          election districts, majority vote requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or\n          other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for\n          discrimination against the minority group;\n       4. if there is a candidate slating process, whether the members of the minority\n          group have been denied access to that process;\n       5. the extent to which members of the minority group in the state or political\n          subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education,\n          employment and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in\n          the political process;\n       6. whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial\n          appeals;\n       7. the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to\n          public office in the jurisdiction.\n       Additional factors that in some cases have had probative value as part of\n       plaintiffs’ evidence to establish a violation are:\n       [8.] whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected\n            officials to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group.\n       [9.] whether the policy underlying the state or political subdivision’s use of such\n            voting qualification, prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice or\n            procedure is tenuous.\n\n478 U.S. 30, 36–37 (1986) (quoting S. REP. NO. 97-417 at 28–29). The Court added, however,\nthat the Senate Report makes clear that “this list of typical factors is neither comprehensive nor\nexclusive” and that “‘there is no requirement that any particular number of factors be proved, or\nthat a majority of them point one way or the other.’” Id. at 45 (quoting S. REP. at 29).\n\n       In finding that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Section 2 claim, the district court\nfirst pointed to evidence in the record of a discriminatory effect on African American voters—\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 32\n\nthat the EIP voting hours and days eliminated by SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 would\n“disproportionately impact African American voters resulting in less opportunity to participate in\nthe political process than other voters.” R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 61) (Page ID #5908).\nThe court pointed to the statistical evidence that African Americans use EIP voting at higher\nrates than others; to the expert testimony of Professor Roscigno and other evidence in the record\nthat African Americans “tend to disproportionately make up the groups that benefit the most\nfrom same-day registration: the poor and the homeless”; that the provision of only one Sunday\nof EIP voting “burdens the voting rights of African Americans by arbitrarily limiting Souls to the\nPolls voting initiatives”; and that, because African Americans are more likely to be of lower-\nsocioeconomic status, they “tend to work hourly jobs and can find it difficult to find time to vote\nduring normal business hours.” Id. at 65–66 (Page ID #5912–13).\n\n        The district court also credited the testimony of Professor Roscigno as establishing\nSenate factors one, two, three, five, six, seven, and nine such that “SB 238 and Directive 2014-17\ninteract with the historical and social conditions facing African Americans in Ohio to reduce the\nopportunity to participate in the political process relative to other groups of voters.” R. 72 (D.\nCt. Op. and Order at 65) (Page ID #5912). While again conceding that Plaintiffs had not\nestablished that voter turnout would necessarily be decreased overall, the district court explained\nthat “by its plain terms, § 2 is not necessarily about voter turnout but about opportunity to\nparticipate in the political process compared to other groups.” Id. at 67 (Page ID #5914). And\nPlaintiffs had, the district court concluded, “demonstrated a strong likelihood of establishing that\nthe combined effects of SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 result in fewer opportunities for African\nAmericans to participate in the electoral process.” Id. at 68 (Page ID #5915) (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\n        Defendants make four arguments as to why the district court’s analysis is incorrect. First,\nthey argue that the district court improperly used the EIP voting system as it existed before SB\n238 and Directive 2014-17 as its benchmark against which to measure the discriminatory effect\non African American voters. Appellants Br. at 39. In so doing, Defendants assert, the district\ncourt used a “retrogression” standard, which is permissible only under Section 5 of the Voting\nRights Act. Id. at 39–42. Second, Defendants contend that the canon of constitutional avoidance\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 33\n\nand federalism counsel in favor of not reading Section 2 to reach changes to early-voting systems\nat all. Id. at 44. Third, Defendants argue that the district court “should not have looked at [the\nSenate] factors at all to resolve this vote-denial claim.” Id. at 53 (emphasis in original). Finally,\nfocusing on the 2010 election data, Defendants contend that “Plaintiffs’ own evidence shows that\nit cannot prove causation.” Id. at 55.\n\n       1. The Test for a Section 2 Vote Denial Claim\n\n       Section 2 applies to any discriminatory “standard, practice, or procedure . . . which\nresults in a denial or abridgement” of the right to vote. 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a) (emphasis added).\nAbridgement’s “core meaning is ‘shorten,’” Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd. (“Bossier II”),\n528 U.S. 320, 333–34 (2000), or “[t]o reduce or diminish,” Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed.\n2009). Similarly, Section 2(b) directs courts to consider whether members of a protected class\nhave “less opportunity” to exercise their right to vote than other groups of voters, not simply\nwhether protected voters only have no opportunity to vote. 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b) (emphasis\nadded). In other words, Section 2 applies to any “standard, practice, or procedure” that makes it\nharder for an eligible voter to cast a ballot, not just those that actually prevent individuals from\nvoting. Cf. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45 n.10 (“Section 2 prohibits all forms of voting discrimination,\nnot just vote dilution.”); S. REP. NO. 97-417 at 30 (“Section 2 remains the major statutory\nprohibition of all voting rights discrimination.”).\n\n       Courts have therefore found a range of “standard[s], practice[s], or procedure[s]” that\nmake it harder, but not necessarily impossible, for eligible voters to vote to fall within Section 2.\nSee, e.g., Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1245 (N.D. Miss.\n1987), aff’d sub nom. Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push, Inc. v. Mabus, 932 F.2d 400\n(5th Cir. 1991) (restrictions on voter registration opportunities); Spirit Lake Tribe v. Benson\nCnty., No. 2:10-cv-095, 2010 WL 4226614 (D.N.D. Oct. 21, 2010) (location of polling places);\nBrown v. Dean, 555 F. Supp. 502 (D.R.I. 1982) (same); Brooks v. Gant, No. Civ. 12-5003, 2012\nWL 4482984 (D.S.D. Sept. 27, 2012) (number and location of early voting sites); Harris v.\nGraddick, 615 F. Supp. 239 (M.D. Ala. 1985) (number of minority poll officials).\n\n       Thus, Plaintiffs’ claim that SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 disproportionately place\nburdens on African American voters that make it harder for them to exercise their right to vote\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.           Page 34\n\nthan other groups of voters is encompassed within Section 2. It does not matter that Plaintiffs do\nnot argue that they are completely prevented from voting.\n\n        We also find unconvincing Defendants’ argument that Section 2 does not cover\nchallenges to early-voting systems, or that the canon of constitutional avoidance or federalism\nconcerns compel such a conclusion. We first note that Defendants have raised these arguments\nfor the first time on appeal. Generally, arguments raised for the first time on appeal are forfeited.\nSee, e.g., Armstrong v. City of Melvindale, 432 F.3d 695, 700 (6th Cir. 2006) (“[T]he failure to\npresent an issue to the district court forfeits the right to have the argument addressed on\nappeal.”). Nevertheless, we briefly address both arguments for the sake of completeness.\n\n        As discussed above, the plain language of Section 2 does not exempt early-voting\nsystems from its coverage. Section 2 applies to any discriminatory “standard, practice, or\nprocedure . . . which results in a denial or abridgement” of the right to vote. 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a).\nIt does not specify that certain “standard[s], practice[s], or procedure[s]” are included within its\nscope and others excluded. The Voting Rights Act contains a similarly broad definition of the\nright to vote:\n\n        The terms “vote” or “voting” shall include all action necessary to make a vote\n        effective in any primary, special, or general election, including, but not limited to,\n        registration, listing pursuant to this chapter, or other action required by law\n        prerequisite to voting, casting a ballot, and having such ballot counted properly\n        and included in the appropriate totals of votes cast with respect to candidates for\n        public or party office and propositions for which votes are received in an election.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973l(c)(1). This definition specifically notes that the right to vote “includ[es], but\n[is] not limited to,” the specified examples. Id.\n\n        Nor has any court held that the Voting Rights Act does not apply to early-voting systems.\nThe Supreme Court has in fact held that the Voting Rights Act should be interpreted broadly:\n\n        Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for the broad remedial purpose\n        of “rid[ding] the country of racial discrimination in voting.” South Carolina v.\n        Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 315 (1966). In Allen v. State Board of Elections,\n        393 U.S. 544, 567 (1969), we said that the Act should be interpreted in a manner\n        that provides “the broadest possible scope” in combating racial discrimination.\n\fNo. 14-3877     Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.        Page 35\n\nChisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 403–04 (1991) (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).\nJohnson v. Governor of Florida, 405 F.3d 1214 (11th Cir. 2005), in which the Eleventh Circuit\nheld that the Voting Rights Act does not apply to felon disenfranchisement laws, is easily\ndistinguishable because the court determined that the Fourteenth Amendment in fact permits\nsuch laws and that the “Senate and House reports” for the Voting Rights Act “strongly suggest\n. . . that Congress did not intend Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to cover felon\ndisenfranchisement provisions.” Id. at 1228–29, 1232–33. Defendants do not point to a textual\nbasis in the Fourteenth Amendment or specific statements in the legislative history of the Voting\nRights Act that would compel a similar conclusion here.\n\n       Regarding Defendants’ federalism arguments, we find Congress’s statement in Section 2\nthat it applies to any discriminatory “standard, practice, or procedure” provides a sufficiently\nclear statement of its intention to change the federal-state balance to encompass a “standard,\npractice, or procedure” related to early voting if it produces discriminatory results in a way\nprohibited by Section 2. “Congress considered the [results] test of [Section 2] ‘necessary and\nappropriate to ensure full protection of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments rights.’” Bush\nv. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 992 (1996) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (quoting S. REP. NO. 97-417 at 27).\nThe Supreme Court has elsewhere repeatedly held that “the Reconstruction Amendments by their\nnature contemplate some intrusion into areas traditionally reserved to the States.” Lopez v.\nMonterey Cnty., 525 U.S. 266, 282 (1999). Finally, we note that the plain text of the National\nVoter Registration Act does not contain a clear statement to the opposite effect; it specifically\nstates that “[n]othing in this chapter authorizes or requires conduct that is prohibited by the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965.” 52 U.S.C. § 20510(d)(2).\n\n       Turning to the case law on Section 2, then, we note that the vast majority of cases have\nconcerned a different kind of claim—vote dilution. Vote dilution claims involve challenges to\nmethods of electing representatives—like redistricting or at-large districts—as having the effect\nof diminishing minorities’ voting strength. Unsurprisingly, then, the case law has developed to\nsuit the particular challenges of vote dilution claims. A clear test for Section 2 vote denial\nclaims—generally used to refer to any claim that is not a vote dilution claim—has yet to emerge.\nSee, e.g., Janai S. Nelson, The Causal Context of Disparate Vote Denial, 54 B.C. L. REV. 579,\n\fNo. 14-3877          Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                       Page 36\n\n595 (2013) (“[T]he legal contours of vote denial claims remain woefully underdeveloped as\ncompared to vote dilution claims.”).\n\n         We read the text of Section 2 and the limited relevant case law as requiring proof of two\nelements for a vote denial claim. First, as the text of Section 2(b) indicates, the challenged\n“standard, practice, or procedure” must impose a discriminatory burden on members of a\nprotected class, meaning that members of the protected class “have less opportunity than other\nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of\ntheir choice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a)–(b). Second, the Supreme Court has indicated that that\nburden must in part be caused by or linked to “social and historical conditions” that have or\ncurrently produce discrimination against members of the protected class.9 Gingles, 478 U.S. at\n47 (“The essence of a § 2 claim is that a certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with\nsocial and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and\nwhite voters to elect their preferred representatives.”). In assessing both elements, courts should\nconsider “the totality of circumstances.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).\n\n         Despite Defendants’ assertions to the contrary, we see no reason why the Senate factors\ncannot be considered in assessing the “totality of the circumstances” in a vote denial claim,\nparticularly with regard to the second element. While the Court has noted that the Senate Report\nindicates that “the enumerated factors will often be pertinent to certain types of § 2 violations,\nparticularly to vote dilution claims,” neither the Report nor the Court suggested that the factors\ncan be considered only in vote dilution claims. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45. And several of the few\nCircuit court decisions to address vote denial claims have expressly stated that the Senate factors\nare relevant to vote denial claims. See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, 405–06 (9th Cir.\n\n\n         9\n           In the few cases considering vote denial claims, this second factor has often been expressed as a\n“causation” requirement, or through statements that a plaintiff cannot establish a Section 2 violation merely by\nshowing a disproportionate impact or burden. See, e.g., Smith v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement & Power\nDist., 109 F.3d 586, 595 (9th Cir. 1997) (stating that a violation of Section 2 cannot be proved only by “a bare\nstatistical showing of disproportionate impact on a racial minority”) (emphasis omitted); Ortiz v. City of\nPhiladelphia Office of City Comm’rs Voter Registration Div., 28 F.3d 306, 310 (3d Cir. 1994) (“[T]he Supreme\nCourt recognized that there must be some causal connection between the challenged electoral practice and the\nalleged discrimination that results in a denial or abridgement of the right to vote.”); Wesley v. Collins, 791 F.2d\n1255, 1260–61 (6th Cir. 1986) (“It is well-settled, however, that a showing of disproportionate racial impact alone\ndoes not establish a per se violation of the Voting Rights Act. Rather, such a showing merely directs the court’s\ninquiry into the interaction of the challenged legislation ‘with those historical, social and political factors generally\nprobative of dilution.’”) (quoting Gingles v.

Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 133 S.\nCt. 2247 (2013); Johnson, 405 F.3d at 1227 n.26 (explaining that, in a vote denial claim, “courts\nconsider a non-exclusive list of objective factors (the ‘Senate factors’) detailed in a Senate\nReport accompanying the 1982 amendments” as part of evaluating whether, under the “totality of\nthe circumstances,” “the political processes . . . are not equally open to participation by\n[members of a protected class]”); Smith, 109 F.3d at 596 n.8 (“Appellants suggest that the\n‘Senate factors’ apply only to ‘vote dilution’ claims. To the contrary, the ‘totality of the\ncircumstances’ test established in § 2(b) was initially applied only in ‘vote denial’ claims such as\nthis.”).\n\n           We find Senate factors one, three, five, and nine particularly relevant to a vote denial\nclaim in that they specifically focus on how historical or current patterns of discrimination\n“hinder [minorities’] ability to participate effectively in the political process.” Gingles, 478 U.S.\nat 37 (quoting Senate factor five).         All of the factors, however can still provide helpful\nbackground context to minorities’ overall ability to engage effectively on an equal basis with\nother voters in the political process.\n\n           2. Assessment of Plaintiffs’ Section 2 Claim\n\n           We conclude that the district court properly found that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on\ntheir Section 2 claim.        Plaintiffs demonstrated that SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 will\ndisproportionately burden African American voters and that this burden means that they will\nhave a harder time voting than other members of the electorate. As previously discussed in\nSections II and III, the district court did not clearly err in crediting the statistical and survey\nanalysis of Plaintiffs’ expert Smith and other studies in the record as demonstrating that African\nAmericans vote EIP at higher rates than other groups, including on the eliminated EIP voting\ndays. Nor did the district court clearly err in considering data from the elections in 2008, 2010,\nand 2012 in reaching this conclusion, rather than focusing solely on 2010 as Defendants’\ncausation argument implicitly urges. Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs did not establish\ncausation is therefore without merit. And the fact that African Americans are more likely to be\nof lower-socioeconomic status in Ohio—as Professor Roscigno’s undisputed report establishes—\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                      Page 38\n\nand both distrust voting by mail and face obstacles doing so, means that the remaining EIP\nvoting times are not sufficient to ensure African Americans have a truly equal opportunity to\nvote as other groups of voters. More specifically, African Americans are more likely to vote on\nSundays through the Souls to the Polls initiatives because of the free transportation church\ngroups can provide. Lower-income individuals face difficulties in voting during the day because\nthey are more likely to work in hourly-wage jobs with little flexibility.                           Lower-income\nindividuals, often because they are more likely to move and/or have difficulty accessing\ntransportation, also most need same-day registration. R. 18-2 (Roscigno Rep. at 16–19) (Page ID\n#266–69). Thus, the disproportionate burdens SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 place on African\nAmericans, combined with their lower-socioeconomic status in Ohio, operate to give African\nAmerican voters “less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the\npolitical process and to elect representatives of their choice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).\n\n         Defendants’ argument that the district court failed to identify an objective benchmark\nagainst which to assess the burdens SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 place on African American\nvoters is unpersuasive. The case law Defendants cite on the need for objective benchmarks\ninvolve vote dilution claims. See, e.g., Holder v. Hall, 512 U.S. 874, 876 (1994) (“This case\npresents the question whether the size of a governing authority is subject to a vote dilution\nchallenge under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act”); Bossier II, 528 U.S. 320 (considering whether\nSection 5 prohibits preclearance of a dilutive, but nonretrogressive redistricting plan).10 A vote\ndilution claim requires courts to make the difficult judgment of whether a challenged practice\nimpermissibly dilutes minorities’ voting strength, or whether minorities’ lack of electoral success\nin fact simply stems from “mere . . . political defeat at the polls.” Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S.\n124, 153 (1971). Thus, determining what an undiluted benchmark should be can be challenging,\nparticularly because Section 2 expressly states that “nothing in this section establishes a right to\nhave members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the\npopulation.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).\n\n\n         10\n             Defendants’ discussion of the necessity of establishing “preconditions” before assessing the “totality of\ncircumstances” similarly comes from vote dilution cases. See Appellants Reply Br. at 17–19. The “preconditions”\nreferenced in Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 41 (1993), for example, refer to three requirements the Supreme Court\nset forth in Gingles that apply to vote dilution claims only. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50–51.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 39\n\n       In contrast, Section 2 vote denial claims inherently provide a clear, workable benchmark.\nAgain, under Section 2(b), the relevant inquiry is whether minority voters “have less opportunity\nthan other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect\nrepresentatives of their choice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b) (emphasis added). The benchmark is thus\nquite straightforward—under the challenged law or practice, how do minorities fare in their\nability “to participate in the political process” as compared to other groups of voters?\n\n       Thus, the district court properly assessed whether, under the system established by SB\n238 and Directive 2014-17, African American voters would have less opportunity than other\nOhio voters to cast their ballots. The disproportionate impact on African American voters as\ncompared to white voters of cutting Sunday and evening EIP voting as well as Golden Week is\nclearly relevant to this inquiry. So, too, is the relative ability of African American voters to vote\nthrough the remaining options available under SB 238 and Directive 2014-17.\n\n       Turning to the second element of a Section 2 vote denial claim, the district court also\nproperly found that Plaintiffs had sufficiently demonstrated that the disproportionate burdens SB\n238 and Directive 2014-17 place on African Americans are in part caused by or linked to “social\nand historical conditions” of discrimination. Professor Roscigno’s undisputed report regarding\nSenate factor five is particularly on point. He explained that African Americans in Ohio tend to\nbe of lower-socioeconomic status because of “stark and persistent racial inequalities . . . [in]\nwork, housing, education and health,” inequalities that stem from “both historical and\ncontemporary discriminatory practices.” R. 18-2 (Roscigno Rep. at 3) (Page ID #253). As\nsupport, Professor Roscigno pointed to “[s]ubstantial bodies of social science research . . . [that]\ninvestigate the root causes of . . . occupational inequalities, often concluding that contemporary\ninstitutional practices and discrimination play a significant role, especially when the disparities\nare as large as they are in Ohio.” Id. at 7 (Page ID #257). “Racial occupational inequalities are\neasily linked to racial disparities in, for instance, family income and poverty status as well as\nresidential and schooling options and racial health disparities.” Id. at 10 (Page ID #260). As\npreviously discussed, African Americans’ lower-socioeconomic status in turn plays a key role in\nexplaining why the disproportionate impact of SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 burdens African\nAmericans’ voting opportunities.\n\fNo. 14-3877       Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.        Page 40\n\n        The remaining Senate factors considered by the district court support its finding that the\nburdens SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 place on African American voters are in part caused by\nor linked to “social and historical conditions” that have produced or currently produce\ndiscrimination against African Americans in Ohio. Given that Plaintiffs’ claim focuses on\nreductions in voting opportunities, past and current discrimination linked to the electoral system\nitself is relevant.   Professor Roscigno’s report demonstrated that, per Senate factor one,\nhistorically “[o]fficial voting-related discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities was a\ncornerstone in Ohio.” Id. at 26 (Page ID #276). More recently, Ohio has implemented “voting\npractices that suppress minority political participation,” such as poll watchers and voter ID\nlaws—practices that fall within the ambit of Senate factor three. Id. at 28–30 (Page ID #278–\n80). Under Senate factor nine, it is also relevant that, as explained in the Equal Protection Clause\nanalysis, the policy justifications for SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 are “tenuous.” Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 37. The evidence Professor Roscigno provided regarding Senate factors two, six,\nand seven—while not as clearly linked to Plaintiffs’ claim—further contextualizes the role race\nstill plays in Ohio elections.\n\n        The district court did not improperly engage in a retrogression analysis in considering the\nopportunities available to African Americans to vote EIP under the prior law as part of the\n“totality of circumstances” inquiry. To be sure, Congress intended—and the Court has read—\nSection 2 and Section 5 not to have exactly the same scope. Procedurally, Section 5 requires that\ncovered states obtain preclearance from the Attorney General or the District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia before they change a voting “qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice,\nor procedure.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973c. Section 2 applies to all states and includes no preclearance\nrequirement. “[T]he purpose of § 5 has always been to insure that no voting-procedure changes\nwould be made that would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect\nto their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.” Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 141\n(1976). In other words, “§ 5 prevents nothing but backsliding,” whereas Section 2 is aimed at\ncombatting “discrimination more generally.” Bossier II, 528 U.S. at 334–35.\n\n        At the same time, however, no case explicitly holds that prior laws or practices cannot be\nconsidered in the Section 2 “totality of circumstances” analysis. The Supreme Court has in fact\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.           Page 41\n\nfound a Section 2 violation under the “totality of circumstances” in part based on changes to the\nelectoral system. League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 439 (2006)\n(noting that “[t]he changes to District 23 undermined the progress of a racial group that has been\nsubject to significant voting-related discrimination and that was becoming increasingly\npolitically active and cohesive”) (emphasis added).        Neither does the legislative history of\nSection 2 indicate that prior laws or practices cannot factor into the analysis. The Senate Report\nto the 1982 amendments states only that “Plaintiffs could not establish a Section 2 violation\nmerely by showing that a challenged reapportionment or annexation, for example, involved a\nretrogressive effect on the political strength of a minority group.” S. REP. NO. 97-417 at 68\nn.224 (1982) (emphasis added). Oxford English Dictionary defines “merely” as “entirely . . .\nonly (what is referred to) and nothing more.” 9 Oxford English Dictionary 629 (2d ed. 1989). In\nother words, the Report simply establishes that challengers cannot show a Section 2 violation\nonly on the basis of retrogressive effects. Indeed, Senate factor nine in fact invites comparison to\nprior laws.    The Senate Report explains that, in assessing the “tenuous[ness]” of policy\njustification for the challenged law or procedure, the fact that “the procedure markedly departs\nfrom past practices or from practices elsewhere in the jurisdiction . . . bears on the fairness of its\nimpact.” S. REP. NO. 97-417 at 239 n.117 (emphasis added).\n\n       Moreover, the Supreme Court has made clear that “some parts of the § 2 analysis may\noverlap with the § 5 inquiry.” Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 478 (2003). Both Section 2\nand Section 5 speak to “abridgement.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a) (Section 2) (“No voting qualification\nor prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any\nState or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of\nany citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . as provided in subsection\n(b) of this section.”) (emphasis added); id. § 1973c(b) (Section 5) (“Any voting qualification or\nprerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting that has the\npurpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States\non account of race or color . . . to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the\nright to vote within the meaning of subsection (a) of this section.”) (emphasis added).\nAbridgement “necessarily entails a comparison.” Bossier II, 528 U.S. at 333–34.\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                      Page 42\n\n         Rather, what is distinct between a Section 5 analysis and a Section 2 analysis is the role\nthat prior law plays in the comparison. The retrogression analysis under Section 5 involves\ncomparing voting opportunities enjoyed by minorities under the status quo as compared to voting\nopportunities minorities would have under the electoral system if the proposed change is\nimplemented. The focus is solely on voting opportunities enjoyed by minorities, and whether\nthose opportunities would be reduced under the proposed law. In contrast, under the Section 2\nanalysis, the focus is whether minorities enjoy less opportunity to vote as compared to other\nvoters. The fact that a practice or law eliminates voting opportunities that used to exist under\nprior law that African Americans disproportionately used is therefore relevant to an assessment\nof whether, under the current system, African Americans have an equal opportunity to participate\nin the political process as compared to other voters.\n\n         As discussed above, Plaintiffs have not asserted that SB 238 and Directive 2014-17\nburden their right to vote merely because they take away EIP voting times that used to exist\nunder prior law. Rather, they have presented evidence that the eliminated EIP voting times are\nthose that African Americans disproportionately use, and that racial inequalities in\nsocioeconomic status and other factors make it much more difficult for African Americans to\nvote at the remaining times or through the other methods now available under the status quo as\ncompared to other groups.11 Thus, the district court did not improperly engage in a retrogressive\nanalysis.\n\n         Finally, we find unpersuasive Defendants’ claim that our decision would have far-\nreaching implications beyond Ohio. Defendants fail to cite any Supreme Court or Sixth Circuit\nauthority to support their argument that we must necessarily consider the practices of other states\nwith regard to EIP voting.\n         11\n            For example, Brown v. Detzner, 895 F. Supp. 2d 1236, 1251 (M.D. Fla. 2012), one of the cases\nDefendants cite in their retrogression argument, see Appellants Br. at 42, is in fact distinguishable from the present\ncase on this basis. The district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining the\nenforcement of a Florida statute reducing the number of early voting days from twelve to fourteen under prior law to\neight days for the 2012 election on the basis that it violated Section 2. Brown, 895 F. Supp. 2d at 1255. The district\ncourt noted that while the reduction in days could have a discriminatory impact, other elements of the statute—such\nas a provision allowing county election officials to increase the number of voting hours on any given day, which\ncould mean that more morning and evening hours would be available than what existed previously, and that the\nstatute increased Sunday early voting opportunities for the state as a whole—meant that the plaintiffs had not\nprovided enough evidence that minority voters on the whole would have less opportunity to vote than other groups\nof voters. Id. at 1252–55.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 43\n\n       In fact, the text of Section 2 and Supreme Court decisions indicate that the opposite is\ntrue. The text of Section 2 directs courts to examine whether the political processes “in the State\nor political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class\n. . . in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to\nparticipate.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b) (emphasis added). The focus is on the internal processes of a\nsingle State or political subdivision and the opportunities enjoyed by that particular electorate.\nThe text of Section 2 does not direct courts to compare opportunities across States. The Supreme\nCourt has likewise characterized the determination of whether a practice violates Section 2 as\n“an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of the contested electoral mechanisms.”\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).             The Court\nexplained that “the [Senate] Committee determined that ‘the question whether the political\nprocesses are “equally open” depends upon a searching practical evaluation of the “past and\npresent reality,”’ and on a ‘functional’ view of the political process.” Id. (quoting S. REP. NO.\n97-417 at 30) (internal citations omitted). “This determination is peculiarly dependent upon the\nfacts of each case.” Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 621 (1982)).\nSee also Holder, 512 U.S. at 881–82 (“It makes little sense to say . . . that the sole commissioner\nsystem should be subject to a [Section 2] dilution challenge if it is rare—but immune if it is\ncommon.”) (Kennedy, J.); Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 406 (“Because a § 2 analysis requires the\ndistrict court to engage in a ‘searching practical evaluation of the ‘past and present reality,’\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 45, . . . a district court’s examination in such a case is ‘intensely fact-based\nand localized,’ Salt River, 109 F.3d at 591.”).\n\n       Defendants tell us that the Court’s statement in Gingles is not relevant because the Court\nwas considering a vote dilution claim, rather than a vote denial claim like that at issue here.\nAppellants Br. at 52. But they provide no explanation as to why that distinction matters or why\nassessments of early voting systems do not likewise require an intensely localized assessment of\ntheir impact on African American voters.\n\n       Ohio faced unique problems in administering the 2004 elections. The General Assembly\nintroduced early voting in 2005 largely to remedy those problems. In the nearly ten years since,\nEIP voting has come to play a special role in Ohio in ensuring that African Americans have an\n\fNo. 14-3877        Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.        Page 44\n\nequal opportunity to participate in the political process that is not necessarily true elsewhere.\nThere is no reason to think our decision here compels any conclusion about the early-voting\npractices in other states, which do not necessarily share Ohio’s particular circumstances.\n\n          In sum, we conclude that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Section 2 of the Voting\nRights Act claim.\n\nE. The Remaining Preliminary Injunction Factors\n\n          “When a party seeks a preliminary injunction on the basis of a potential constitutional\nviolation, ‘the likelihood of success on the merits often will be the determinative factor.’”\nObama for America, 697 F.3d at 436 (quoting Jones v. Caruso, 569 F.3d 258, 265 (6th Cir.\n2009)).     Although we have concluded that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Equal\nProtection Clause claim and their Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act claim, we still consider the\nremaining three preliminary injunction factors.\n\n          First, we conclude that Plaintiffs have established that they will suffer irreparable harm\nabsent an injunction. “When constitutional rights are threatened or impaired, irreparable injury\nis presumed. A restriction on the fundamental right to vote therefore constitutes irreparable\ninjury.” Id. (internal citations omitted).\n\n          Regarding the final two factors, we conclude that the issuance of the injunction would not\ncause substantial harm to others and that the public interest weighs in its favor. The significant\nburden on the ability to vote of the voters Plaintiffs represent outweighs any burden on\nDefendants, who have failed to demonstrate that BOEs would not be able to administer the extra\ndays and evening hours of EIP voting required by the preliminary injunction, a schedule BOEs\nhad previously administered in past elections. As we explained in Obama for America:\n\n          While states have “a strong interest in their ability to enforce state election law\n          requirements,” Hunter [v. Hamilton Cnty. Bd. of Elections, 635 F.3d 219, 244\n          (6th Cir. 2011)], the public has a “strong interest in exercising the ‘fundamental\n          political right’ to vote.” Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4 (2006) (quoting Dunn,\n          405 U.S. at 336). “That interest is best served by favoring enfranchisement and\n          ensuring that qualified voters’ exercise of their right to vote is successful.”\n          Hunter, 635 F.3d at 244. The public interest therefore favors permitting as many\n          qualified voters to vote as possible.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 45\n\nObama for America, 697 F.3d at 436–37. We have previously rejected Defendants’ argument\nthat upholding the preliminary injunction risks confusing voters. Ohio State Conference of\nN.A.A.C.P. v. Husted, No. 14-3877, 2014 WL 4494938, at *5 (6th Cir. Sept. 12, 2014).\nRegarding Defendants’ laches argument, we “review[] a district court’s resolution of a laches\nquestion for an abuse of discretion.” Chirco v. Crosswinds Communities, Inc., 474 F.3d 227, 231\n(6th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Defendants have not explained how Plaintiffs\ncould have more quickly produced the voluminous record evidence in this case in support of\ntheir motion for a preliminary injunction, nor have Defendants produced any evidence that\nPlaintiffs purposefully delayed. We therefore find that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in determining that Defendants “ha[d] not shown . . . a lack of diligence” by Plaintiffs\nto move promptly for a preliminary injunction. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 6) (Page ID\n#5853).\n\nF. The District Court’s Remedy\n\n       Defendants suggest in one paragraph in their brief on appeal that the district court’s\npreliminary injunction itself might violate the Equal Protection Clause by allowing BOEs to set\nEIP voting hours in addition to those set forth in the preliminary injunction order and Directive\n2014-17 because BOEs might set unequal EIP voting hours. Appellants Br. at 28–29. This\nargument appears to implicate issues of state law that have not been fully developed on appeal.\nThe Ohio Revised Code authorizes BOEs to set their own EIP voting hours. Ohio Rev. Code\n§§ 3501.10(b), 3501.11. The district court’s order expressly ties its remedy to what is already\npermitted under Ohio law: “Secretary Husted is enjoined from preventing individual county\nBoards of Election from adopting, by a majority vote of their members and in accordance with\nthe procedures established by Ohio election law,” additional EIP voting hours. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op.\nand Order at 71) (Page ID #5918) (emphasis added). Neither party has directly addressed\nSecretary Husted’s authority to impose uniform EIP voting hours despite the provisions of the\nOhio Revised Code that appear to vest discretion in BOEs to set their own hours. Id. at 4 (Page\nID #5851). At this stage in the litigation, with only days until early voting is set to begin, and\nhaving found that all four factors weigh in favor of granting Plaintiffs a preliminary injunction,\nwe do not address this argument at this time.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.   Page 46\n\n                                     III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment granting a\npreliminary injunction.\n\f",

Defendants Jon Husted, the Ohio Secretary\nof State, and Mike DeWine, the Ohio Attorney General, appeal from the district court’s order\ngranting Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.       The district court enjoined the\nenforcement of Senate Bill 238 (“SB 238”) and Secretary of State Directive 2014-17, and\nordered the restoration of additional early in-person (“EIP”) voting hours as set forth below on\nthe basis that SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 violate the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. For the reasons set\nforth below, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment granting the preliminary injunction.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Procedural History\n\n        Plaintiffs, Ohio State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of\nColored People et al. (“NAACP”), filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of Ohio on May 1, 2014, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1973\nchallenging the constitutionality and legality of SB 238 and Directive 2014-17.           In their\ncomplaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs allege that SB 238 and Directive 2014-\n06 (now Directive 2014-17) (1) violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment by burdening the fundamental right to vote; and (2) violate Section 2 of the Voting\nRights Act of 1965 by  disproportionately burdening African American voters’ ability to\nparticipate effectively in the political process.\n\n        On June 30, 2014, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to “enjoin the\nenforcement of . . . Senate Bill 238 . . . and require Defendant Husted to set uniform and suitable\nin-person early voting hours for all eligible voters that includes multiple Sundays and weekday\nevening hours.” R. 17 (Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 61) (Page ID #152). Following a hearing on\nAugust 11, 2014, the district court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 3\n\nSeptember 4, 2014. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 70) (Page ID #5917). The district court’s\norder provided as follows:\n\n       That the State of Ohio and the Secretary Husted are enjoined from enforcing and\n       implementing SB 238’s amendments to § 3509.01 of the Ohio Revised Code\n       reducing the EIP voting period from 35 days before an election to the period\n       beginning the day following the close of voter registration;\n       That, for purposes of the 2014 general election, the EIP voting period shall consist\n       of the 35 days prior to the election as was the case [prior] to SB 238’s enactment;\n       That, for the 2014 general election, Defendant Secretary Husted shall require all\n       Ohio county Boards of Election to set uniform and suitable EIP voting hours, in\n       addition to those currently established by Directive 2014-17, for the following\n       days:\n           •   Tuesday, September 30, 2014 through Friday, October 3, 2014;\n           •   Monday, October 6, 2014;\n           •   Evening voting hours between Monday, October 20, 2014 and Friday,\n               October, 24, 2014, and between Monday, October 27, 2014 and Friday,\n               October 31, 2014. Provided, that in setting such hours, Husted must, in\n               good faith, take into consideration the Court’s findings and legal\n               conclusions regarding the impact of a lack of evening voting hours on the\n               protected classes of voters discussed in this Memorandum Opinion and\n               Order; and\n           •   Sunday, October 26, 2014; and\n       That Defendant Secretary Husted is enjoined from preventing individual county\n       Boards of Election from adopting, by a majority vote of their members and in\n       accordance with the procedures established by Ohio election law, EIP voting\n       hours in addition to those specified above and in Directive 2014-17.\n       Further, all issues regarding and pertaining to future elections are deferred and\n       reserved for consideration on the motion for a permanent injunction. In the\n       interim, the Ohio General [A]ssembly is charged with the responsibility of\n       passing legislation consistent with this Memorandum Opinion and Order. . . .\n\nId. at 70–71 (Page ID #5917–18) (footnote omitted).\n\n       Defendants timely appealed the district court’s order granting a preliminary injunction to\nPlaintiffs and moved this court to expedite that appeal.         After the district court denied\nDefendants’ motion for a stay of that order, Defendants moved this court to stay the order\npending appeal. We granted Defendants’ motion to expedite the appeal on September 11, 2014,\nand denied their motion for a stay of the order granting a preliminary injunction to Plaintiffs on\nSeptember 12, 2014.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 4\n\n       The Ohio General Assembly (“General Assembly”) filed a motion with the district court\non July 11, 2014 to intervene in this case, which the district court denied on July 30. On August\n1, the General Assembly filed a notice of appeal of that decision, which appeal is pending under\ncase number 14-3756.\n\n       After the district court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and after\nDefendants filed their notice of appeal in the instant case (appeal number 14-3877), the district\ncourt granted the General Assembly’s renewed motion to intervene, stating that the motion was\ngranted “for the purpose of appeal only.” R. 75 (D. Ct. Order Granting General Assembly’s\nIntervention for Appeal) (Page ID #5954). The General Assembly then filed a notice of appeal\nthat is docketed as appeal number 14-3881. The General Assembly has filed a brief in appeal\n14-3881. It has also filed a motion to file a brief instanter in 14-3877, which included an\naccompanying brief supporting Defendants’ appeal in this case. We do not address in this appeal\nwhether the district court’s intervention decisions were proper, and we do not resolve appeals\nnumbers 14-3756 and 14-3881. Nevertheless, we consider the arguments the General Assembly\npresented in the brief filed in 14-3881 as if it were filed as an amicus curiae brief in this case.\nMoreover, we also consider the arguments presented by amici curiae United States and\nCuyahoga County in briefs filed in this case.\n\nB. Factual Background\n\n       Ohio established early in-person voting largely in response to well-documented problems\nin administering the 2004 general election. As we explained in Obama for America v. Husted,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2012), “[d]uring that election, Ohio voters faced long lines and wait-times\nthat, at some polling places, stretched into the early morning of the following day.” Id. at 426.\nIn League of Women Voters of Ohio v. Brunner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1287216\"><a href=\"/opinion/1287216/league-of-women-voters-of-ohio-v-brunner/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2008), we summarized\nthe problems the League of Women Voters of Ohio reported voters faced as follows:\n\n       Voters were forced to wait from two to twelve hours to vote because of\n       inadequate allocation of voting machines. Voting machines were not allocated\n       proportionately to the voting population, causing more severe wait times in some\n       counties than in others. At least one polling place, voting was not completed until\n       4:00 a.m. on the day following election day. Long wait times caused some voters\n       to leave their polling places without voting in order to attend school, work, or to\n       family responsibilities or because a physical disability prevented them from\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.        Page 5\n\n       standing in line. Poll workers received inadequate training, causing them to\n       provide incorrect instructions and leading to the discounting of votes. In some\n       counties, poll workers misdirected voters to the wrong polling place, forcing them\n       to attempt to vote multiple times and delaying them by up to six hours.\n\nId. at 477–78. In sum, many voters in the 2004 general election were effectively disenfranchised\nand unable to vote.\n\n       In 2005, the Ohio General Assembly passed Substitute House Bill 234 to remedy these\nproblems. 2005 Ohio Laws 40 (Sub. H.B. 234). HB 234 instituted no-fault early voting,\neliminating the requirement that Ohio voters had to provide an excuse for not being able to vote\non Election Day in order to vote early. Early voting is done via an “absentee ballot,” which may\nbe cast either early in-person (“EIP”) at the voter’s Board of Elections’ (“BOE”) designated\nvoting location or by mailing the ballot to the BOE. Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.05(A). Each county\nhas one BOE, which is permitted to operate only one location for EIP voting. Id. § 3501.10(C).\nUnder the 2005 early-voting scheme, the BOEs were required to make absentee ballots available\nfor voters—either for EIP voting or by mail voting—no later than 35 days before the election.\nId. § 3509.01(B)(2) (2014) (as amended Feb. 25, 2014).        Ohio law requires voters to be\nregistered at least 30 days prior to an election.      Ohio Const. § 5.01; Ohio Rev. Code\n§ 3503.01(A). Therefore, Ohio voters could register and vote on the same day for a five-day\nperiod that Plaintiffs refer to as “Golden Week.”\n\n       Until 2012, Ohio law gave each of the BOEs for Ohio’s eighty-eight counties the\ndiscretion to set their own EIP voting hours. R. 62 (Parties’ Statement Undisputed Facts ¶ 6)\n(Page ID #3307). Thus, for the 2008 and 2010 elections each BOE set its own EIP voting hours.\nId. Several counties, including six counties with the highest African American populations in\nOhio, offered early voting during the evenings and on multiple Sundays. Id. ¶ 8 (Page ID\n#3307); R. 65-3 (2010 Early Voting Days & Times) (Page ID #4576–84); R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and\nOrder at 9) (Page ID #5856).\n\n       On August 15, 2012, Secretary Husted issued Directive 2012-35, which established\nuniform EIP voting hours for all BOEs for the 2012 general election. R. 62 (Parties’ Statement\nUndisputed Facts ¶ 15 (Page ID #3308). Directive 2012-35 eliminated all weekend EIP voting\nhours. R. 18-34 (Directive 2012-35) (Page ID #527–28). It did provide for some evening EIP\n\fNo. 14-3877       Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.           Page 6\n\nvoting hours on ten weekdays in the last two weeks before Election Day. Id. Directive 2012-35\nwas challenged in separate litigation as violating the Equal Protection Clause because it allowed\nonly military voters to vote EIP during the last three days before the election. In Obama for\nAmerica, we upheld the district court’s issuance of a preliminary injunction enjoining the\nenforcement of the Directive regarding the last three days of EIP voting before the election;\nunder the preliminary injunction local BOEs had discretion to set EIP voting hours for those days\nso long as those hours applied to all voters, not just military voters. 697 F.3d at 437.\n\n         In the 2008, 2010, and 2012 elections, many Ohio voters took advantage of early voting.\nAs we noted in Obama for America, in 2008 “approximately 1.7 million Ohioans cast their\nballots before election day, amounting to 20.7% of registered voters and 29.7% of the total votes\ncast. . . . In 2010, approximately 1 million Ohioans voted early, and 17.8% of them chose to cast\ntheir ballots in person.” 697 F.3d at 426. In the 2012 election, roughly 32% of Ohioans voted\nearly. R. 18-1 (Smith Rep. at 6) (Page ID #167). Thousands of voters also registered or updated\ntheir registration and voted during Golden Week. R. 62 (Parties’ Statement Undisputed Facts\n¶¶ 10, 14) (Page ID #3308).\n\n         The General Assembly passed SB 238 on February 19, 2014, and it went into effect on\nJune 1, 2014. SB 238 amended the Ohio Code to make the first permitted day of early voting the\nday after the close of voter registration. Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.01(B)(2)–(3). Thus, SB 238\nreduces the total number of EIP voting days by eliminating Golden Week. SB 238 largely\nmirrored the recommendations in a report by the Ohio Association of Election Officials\n(“OAEO”). R. 18-33 (OAEO Rep.) (Page ID #521–26).\n\n         On February 25, 2014, Secretary Husted issued Directive 2014-06, which set EIP voting\nhours for the 2014 primary and general elections. For the general elections, the Directive did not\ninclude EIP voting hours for the following times: (1) the Sunday and Monday immediately\nbefore Election Day; (2) Tuesday, September 30th through Monday, October 6th, the last day for\nvoter registration (Golden Week); (3) Saturday, October 11th, Sunday, October 19th, or Sunday,\nOctober 26th; and (4) evening EIP voting hours after 5 p.m. on all weekdays or after 4 p.m. on\nSaturday, October 25th and Saturday, November 1st. R. 18-36 (Directive 2014-06 at 2) (Page ID\n#531).\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 7\n\n       On June 11, 2014, however, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio\nissued a permanent injunction in Obama for America. No. 2:12-CV-636, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2611316</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(S.D. Ohio June 11, 2014). The district court “require[d] Secretary of State Husted to set\nuniform and suitable in-person early voting hours for all eligible voters for the three days\npreceding all future elections.” Id. at *5. No party appealed this final judgment.\n\n       To comply with the permanent injunction, Secretary Husted issued Directive 2014-17 on\nJune 17, 2014. R. 18-37 (Directive 2014-17) (Page ID #532–33). Directive 2014-17 sets\nuniform EIP voting hours for all future elections in three categories: (1) Presidential General\nElections; (2) Presidential Primary Elections and Gubernatorial General Elections; and\n(3) Regular Municipal Elections, Primary Elections, and Special Elections. Id. As required by\nthe permanent injunction, Directive 2014-17 restores EIP voting hours for the Gubernatorial\nGeneral Elections (the only election relevant to the 2014 general election) on the Sunday and\nMonday immediately prior to Election Day on November 4, 2014. Id. at 2 (Page ID #533). In\nall other respects Directive 2014-17 sets the same EIP voting hours that Directive 2014-06 set for\nthe Gubernatorial General Election.

However, we review de novo the district court’s legal conclusions, and we review\nits factual findings for clear error. Id. Thus, “[t]he district court’s determination will be\ndisturbed only if the district court relied upon clearly erroneous findings of fact, improperly\napplied the governing law, or used an erroneous legal standard.” McNeilly v.

The District Court’s Factual Findings Are Not Clearly Erroneous\n\n       The district court analyzed the record evidence and made a number of factual findings in\ngranting Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. In particular, the district court’s opinion\ncarefully considered the conclusions of Plaintiffs’ four expert witnesses (Smith, Roscigno,\nBurden, and Gronke) and Defendants’ three expert witnesses (Trende, McCarty, and Brunell).\nSee R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 26‒45) (Page ID #5873‒92). After assessing each, the district\ncourt credited Smith’s conclusion that, based on his statistical analysis, African Americans will\nbe disproportionately and negatively affected by the reductions in early voting in SB 238 and\nDirective 2014-17.     Id. at 44‒45 (Page ID #5891‒92).           The district court also accepted\nRoscigno’s “undisputed” findings that disparities in employment and in residential,\ntransportation, and childcare options between African American and white voters significantly\nincreased the cost of casting a vote for African American voters. Id. at 45 (Page ID #5892). The\ndistrict court then relied on Smith’s statistical findings and conclusions in its Equal Protection\nanalysis, and it relied on both Smith’s and Roscigno’s findings in its Voting Rights Act analysis.\n\n       Defendants have not challenged the admissibility of any of Plaintiffs’ experts’\nconclusions under Daubert, either at the district court or on appeal. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow\nPharm., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). Indeed, Defendants’ brief makes little mention of the district\ncourt’s factual findings or its decision to credit the conclusions of Plaintiffs’ experts. Thus,\nwhether or not the district court properly considered these expert findings is not before us. In\nany event, while they do not dispute Roscigno’s, Burden’s, or Gronke’s conclusions, to the\nextent Defendants and the General Assembly believe the district court improperly credited\nSmith’s findings over the conclusions offered by Defendants’ experts, they are mistaken.\n\n       We review a district court’s factual findings for clear error. Williamson v.

First, contrary to the General Assembly’s\nclaim, the record does not support a finding that the district court erred because Smith’s\nconclusions are based on faulty data. General Assembly Br. at 48‒51. The district court\nrecognized at the outset of its analysis “that some significant limitations exist regarding the\navailable election data,” including different election management systems and policies for\ntabulating absentee votes among the counties, which made statewide comparisons difficult. R.\n72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 26‒27) (Page ID #5873‒74). Indeed, Smith suggested as much in\nhis expert reports. R. 18-1 (Smith Rep. at 12) (Page ID #173); 53-11 (Smith Rebuttal Rep. at 1‒\n2, 25) (Page ID #1628‒29, 1652).\n\n       Recognizing these limitations, Smith utilized several techniques based on entirely\ndifferent statistical methods and data sources to determine whether the propensity of African\nAmericans to cast EIP ballots in Ohio is greater than whites. See 53-11 (Smith Supp. Rep. at 1‒\n2, 25) (Page ID #1628‒29, 1652). In particular, Smith utilized a “triangulation” method, which\nrelied on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Ohio, and county Boards of Elections, and included\nthree different “standard ecological inference techniques” to analyze voting trends in the 2010\nmidterm and 2012 presidential elections. Id. at 1 (Page ID #1628). Then, in a separate analysis,\nSmith examined data from the Current Population Voting and Registration Supplement to\ndetermine whether African American voters in Ohio were disproportionately more likely to cast\nEIP ballots in the 2012 and 2008 elections based on this data. Id. at 1–2 (Page ID #1628‒29).\nAs the district court found, by varying degrees, each of these examinations supports Smith’s\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                      Page 10\n\nconclusion that African American voters in Ohio utilize EIP voting at higher rates than white\nvoters in recent elections.1\n\n         Smith then supplemented his findings by citing additional studies indicating that African\nAmerican and indigent voters utilized early voting more than white and affluent voters and\nwould be negatively impacted by restrictions on early voting. See, e.g., R. 18-1 (Smith Rep. at 7,\n17, 29–30) (Page ID #168, 178, 190–91); R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 45–46) (Page ID\n#5892–93). These findings are further supported by expert reports submitted by Gronke and\nBurden and studies attached to Plaintiffs’ briefing to the district court.2 See R. 72 (D. Ct. Op.\nand Order at 45–46) (Page ID #5892–93); 53-5 (Gronke Rep. at 6‒12) (Page ID #1563‒69)\n(noting research indicating that African Americans disproportionately use early voting in many\nstates and shortening the early-vote period negatively impacted turnout among African\nAmericans); R. 53-4 (Burden Rep. at 3) (Page ID #1555) (citing research noting that “restrictions\non early voting in Florida finds that it deterred participation of black voters”). Although,\nstanding alone, any one analysis may not have proven dispositive, when reading them together\nand as properly supported by other record evidence, the district court did not clearly err by\ncrediting Smith’s analysis despite the possibility of flaws in the data.\n\n         Second, for the same reason, limitations in Smith’s analysis of the 2010 election do not\ndemonstrate that the district court clearly erred by relying on Smith’s findings.                            General\n\n         1\n           The General Assembly argues that the district court clearly erred because it relied on Smith to find that\nAfrican American voters used EIP voting at “far greater rates” than white voters in Ohio, but Smith himself never\nmade such a claim. General Assembly Br. at 46‒48. Although it is true that Smith never used the phrase “far\ngreater rate,” see, e.g., R. 18-1 (Smith Rep. at 17) (Page ID #178) (finding African Americans used EIP at a “greater\nrate” than whites), he did conclude that in the 2012 election African Americans used EIP voting at a “much higher”\nrate than white voters and characterized his findings as “dramatic.” Id. He further noted the “strong empirical\nevidence” showing that African Americans cast EIP absentee ballots more than whites and do so on the days\neliminated by SB 238 and Directive 2014-06. Id. at 4 (Page ID #165). Based on this, and the additional evidence\nthe district court relied on to support its findings, the district court did not clearly err in its characterization of\nSmith’s conclusions.\n         2\n          Presumably due to the expedited nature of the proceedings, both parties relied on evidence in the form of\nreports by experts and studies cited therein to support their respective positions. See 11A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT,\nARTHUR R. MILLER, & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2949 (3d ed. 2001) (“[I]nasmuch\nas the grant of a preliminary injunction is discretionary, the trial court should be allowed to give even inadmissible\nevidence some weight when it is thought advisable to do so in order to serve the primary purpose of preventing\nirreparable harm before a trial can be had.”); Certified Restoration Dry Cleaning Network, L.L.C. v.

Husted et al.        Page 11\n\nAssembly Br. at 51‒52. Defendants cite the 2010 analysis to show that the early-voting days that\nwere eliminated were among the days with the lowest African American voting rates.\nAppellants Br. at 56. And it is true that Smith’s 2010 analysis considered only data from five of\neighty-eight Ohio counties. But, here, it is Defendants who attempt to cherry-pick the findings.\nAgain, Smith’s analysis of the 2010 mid-term election was one of a number of studies cited by\nthe district court in support of its conclusion that African Americans would be disproportionately\nimpacted by restrictions in EIP voting. Moreover, the five counties analyzed by Smith in his\nfindings based on the 2010 election make up one-third of Ohio’s population and nearly seventy-\nthree percent of all African Americans living in Ohio, and the findings overall indicate that\nAfrican Americans participated in EIP at a higher rate than white voters in these counties. R. 18-\n1 (Smith Rep. at 10) (Page ID #171); R. 53-11 (Smith Rebuttal Rep. at 22) (Page ID #1649).\nThus, the 2010 analysis is certainly relevant to whether African American voters utilized early\nvoting more than white voters, and the district court properly considered this finding along with\nthe other evidence in the record in reaching its conclusion.\n\n       Third, the General Assembly’s suggestion that Smith’s analyses relating to the 2012 and\n2008 elections are not probative here because these were presidential elections and the 2014\nelection is an off-year election is not well-taken. General Assembly Br. at 52‒53. Plaintiffs’\ncomplaint does not limit its challenge to the 2014 midterm elections. See R. 1 (Complaint) (Page\nID #1). Indeed, SB 238 is the law in Ohio and will apply to all elections moving forward, and\nnothing in the record suggests that the restrictions on early voting in Directive 2014-17 will be\nlimited to the 2014 election.     In fact, Directive 2014-17 expressly applies to “Presidential\nGeneral Elections.” R. 18-37 (Directive 2014-17 at 1) (Page ID #532). Thus, any attempt to\ndiminish the probative value of Smith’s 2012 and 2008 election analyses for this reason has no\nmerit. Similarly, attempts to disregard voter turnout among African Americans in the 2012 and\n2008 elections because African American voters were targeted by an African American\npresidential candidate are equally meritless. General Assembly Br. at 53. The suggestion is that\nAfrican American voters in Ohio—a “battleground” state, central to any presidential candidate’s\nchance of winning an election—will not be as heavily targeted in future elections. Id. But this\nclaim is both unsupported by record evidence and, given the continued importance of Ohio in\nnational elections, contrary to common sense. See R. 41-3 (Trende Rep. at 31) (Page ID #1041)\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.        Page 12\n\n(noting that African American voter turnout has risen in Ohio and the United States as a whole\nsince 2004); see also Florida v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

See Appellants Br. at 56; General Assembly Br. at 52.\nWhile we acknowledge that a Daubert issue is not before us, it remains true that district courts\nplay the role of “gatekeeper” and are charged “with evaluating the relevance and reliability of\nproffered expert testimony with heighted care.” Surles ex rel. Johnson v. Greyhound Lines, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796549\"><a href=\"/opinion/796549/sharon-surles-by-next-friend-jayneice-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 295 (6th Cir. 2007). For this reason, we generally defer to the district court’s\ndecision to credit one expert over another. In re Scrap Metal, 527 F.3d at 528 (recognizing the\ndeference afforded a district court’s assessment of expert testimony). Moreover, “[w]here there\nare two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be\nclearly erroneous.” Anderson, 470 U.S. at 574.\n\n       Here, Trende analyzed EIP turnout from the 2010 elections and found that, contrary to\nSmith’s conclusion, “it is difficult to conclude that early voting enhances African-American\nturnout.” R. 41-3 (Trende Rep. at 42) (Page ID #1052). He acknowledged, however, that the\n“strength of the relationship tested depends on the judgment call that is made about the different\nvariables.” Id. Indeed, Trende asserted that much of his analysis—as was undoubtedly the case\nfor Smith’s analysis—reflected judgment calls that could “reasonably be argued either way.” Id.\nat 34 (Page ID #1044). The district court’s decision in assessing the evidence to then credit\nSmith’s findings—an academic in the area of electoral processes and election issues, R. 18-1\n(Smith Rep. at 2‒3) (Page ID #163‒64)—and the judgment calls inherent in the same, over\nTrende’s—an elections analyst for the political website RealClearPolitics, who apparently has\nnot conducted a peer-reviewed analysis similar to the one at issue here, R. 41-3 (Trende Rep. at\n3) (Page ID #1013); R. 53-6 (7/30/14 Trende Dep. at 281) (Page ID #1576)—is afforded\ndeference. In re Scrap Metal, 527 F.3d at 528. Given this, along with the multiple methods and\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.           Page 13\n\ndata sources used by Smith and other record evidence corroborating his findings, we conclude\nthat the district court did not clearly err by crediting Smith’s findings over Trende’s.\n\n       Finally, the General Assembly’s claim that the district court erred because Smith’s\nmethodology is flawed also fails. The General Assembly asserts that Smith’s findings are\nunreliable because factors other than race could explain the results of Smith’s census block\nanalysis of the 2012 election, General Assembly Br. at 54‒55; however, no evidence is offered\nsupporting this. Moreover, the other record evidence suggesting that African American voters\nutilize EIP voting at higher rates than white voters indicates that race, rather than some other\nvariable, helps explain Smith’s findings in his 2012 census block analysis. At the least, the\ndistrict court did not clearly err in so finding. See Surles, 474 F.3d at 295 (noting the “broad\ndiscretion” district courts possess to assess the reliability of expert findings); see also McLean v.\n988011 Ontario, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770179\"><a href=\"/opinion/770179/john-d-mclean-personal-representative-of-the-estate-of-lisa-irene-jiggens/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 801 (6th Cir. 2000) (“[M]ere ‘weaknesses in the factual\nbasis of an expert witness’ opinion . . . bear on the weight of the evidence rather than on its\nadmissibility.’”) (quoting United States v.

Cooke Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604870\"><a href=\"/opinion/604870/united-states-v-le-cooke-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 342 (6th Cir. 1993)).\n\n       Similarly, Defendants’ expert, Dr. Nolan McCarty, and Smith quibble over whether\nSmith should have conducted his census block analysis at the county level rather than the\nprecinct level—McCarty claims the results are more accurate at the county level while Smith\nasserts that “aggregat[ing] up . . . dramatically worsens the problem of aggregation bias.”\nCompare R. 53-11 (Smith Rebuttal Rep. at 5‒6) (Page ID # 1632‒33), with General Assembly\nBr. at 55‒56. And the General Assembly claims that the district court gave too much weight to\nthe “direction of the relationship” between African American voters and EIP voting in the 2012\nand 2010 analyses and ignored the “degree of the relationship,” which it claims is small. General\nAssembly Br. at 56‒57. But neither argument supports reversal—again, given the other record\nevidence supporting Smith’s conclusion and the deference afforded the district court, the district\ncourt’s position is plausible based on the record as a whole, and so there is no clear error.

Id. at 50 (Page\nID #5897). First, SB 238 in conjunction with Directive 2014-17 reduced the overall number of\nEIP voting days from 35 to 28 days. The district court noted evidence in the record that 67,408\nOhioans voted in 2008 during Golden Week; 26,230 did so in 2010; and 89,224 voters did so in\n2012. Id. The district court also credited statistical and survey analysis by Plaintiffs’ expert\nSmith that African American voters in Ohio have higher EIP voting rates than white voters, and\nthat African American voters in the 2008, 2010, and 2012 elections “disproportionately cast EIP\nabsentee ballots on days that would have been eliminated by SB 238 and Directive 2014-06.” R.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 16\n\n72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 32, 50) (Page ID #5879, 5897); R. 18-1 (Smith Rep. at 31) (Page ID\n#192). The district court cited four other statistical studies in the record on racial early-voting\npatterns in Ohio that it found supported Smith’s conclusions. Id. at 45–46 (Page ID #5892–93).\n\n       Second, the district court concluded that the elimination of Golden Week “burdens the\nvoting rights of lower income and homeless individuals” because the record reflected that such\nindividuals “move frequently” as well as “lack access to transportation,” which combine to make\nit harder for such individuals to maintain accurate registration. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at\n51) (Page ID #5898). Thus, the ability to register and vote on the same day “can make the\ndifference between being able to exercise the fundamental right to vote and not being able to do\nso.” Id. The court pointed to evidence in the record that 12,842 voters used Golden Week to\nregister or update their registration and vote in 2008; 1,651 voters did so in 2010; and\n5,844 voters did so in 2012. Id.\n\n       Turning to Directive 2014-17, the district court found that it burdened African American\nand lower-income voters by eliminating all evening voting hours for non-presidential elections\nand by providing only one Sunday of EIP voting, the Sunday before Election Day. Id. at 51–53\n(Page ID #5898–5900). The district court noted that the record reflected that lower-income\nvoters are “more likely to rely on public transportation and work wage-based jobs wherein they\nare less likely” to be able to vote between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. at the one early-voting location\npermitted in each county, which might be a great distance away. Id. at 53 (Page ID #5900).\nRegarding the elimination of all but one Sunday of EIP voting, the court pointed to evidence in\nthe record that since the instatement of EIP voting, African Americans have come to rely on\nSunday voting through “Souls to the Polls initiatives,” in which churches have leveraged the\ntransportation they already provide to and from church to bring voters to EIP voting locations.\nId. at 52 (Page ID #5899). Souls to the Polls organizers reported that, during the one permitted\nday of Sunday voting during the 2012 general election, there were long lines of mainly African\nAmerican voters. Id. While the district court acknowledged that Souls to the Polls organizers\ncould switch to the two Saturdays that are still designated EIP voting days under Directive 2014-\n17, the court concluded that this would still impose “some burden” because churches are already\norganized to provide transportation on Sundays. Id. at 53 (Page ID #5900).\n\fNo. 14-3877       Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.       Page 17\n\n       Therefore, because the district court found that the burden imposed on Plaintiffs was\n“significant,” it proceeded to apply the Anderson-Burdick test to SB 238 and Directive 2014-17.\nR. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 55) (Page ID #5902).\n\n       Defendants argue that rational basis review, rather than the Anderson-Burdick test, is the\nproper standard of review for two reasons. First, they argue that “[t]he ‘right to vote’ has never\nincluded the ‘right to receive absentee ballots.’” Appellants Br. at 18 (quoting McDonald v. Bd.\nof Election Comm’rs of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107917\"><a href=\"/opinion/107917/mcdonald-v-board-of-election-commrs-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 807 (1969)). Second, Defendants argue that\nwhen a facially neutral voting law is at issue, as SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 are, the Supreme\nCourt in Crawford held that Anderson-Burdick applies only if the law “severely burdens the right\nto vote of the general class of state voters.” Id. at 19. Otherwise, Defendants assert that\ntraditional Equal Protection Clause principles govern—which require proof of discriminatory\nintent—and Plaintiffs have not established that either SB 238 or Directive 2014-17 was adopted\nwith discriminatory intent. Id. at 19, 27. Finally, if Anderson-Burdick review does apply,\nDefendants argue that the district court improperly determined that the burden imposed on voters\nrepresented by Plaintiffs is “significant.” Id. at 31.\n\n1. The District Court Properly Applied Anderson-Burdick Review\n\n       We addressed Defendants’ first argument regarding McDonald in Obama for America.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In McDonald, the Supreme Court did not apply rational basis review to the\nchallenged Illinois statute allowing only certain categories of voters to receive absentee ballots\nsolely because absentee ballots were at issue. Rather,\n\n       [t]he McDonald plaintiffs failed to make out a claim for heightened scrutiny\n       because they had presented no evidence to support their allegation that they were\n       being prevented from voting. See O’Brien v. Skinner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108908\"><a href=\"/opinion/108908/obrien-v-skinner/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (1974)\n       (“Essentially the Court’s disposition of the claims in McDonald rested on failure\n       of proof.”); Goosby v.

Husted et al.           Page 18\n\nchallenged Directive’s elimination of early in-person voting for the three days immediately\npreceding Election Day violated the Equal Protection Clause. Id. Unlike the plaintiffs in\nMcDonald, we noted that “Plaintiffs introduced extensive evidence that a significant number of\nOhio voters will in fact be precluded from voting without the additional three days of in-person\nearly voting.” Id. This evidence included “statistical studies that estimated approximately\n100,000 Ohio voters would choose to vote during the three-day period before Election Day, and\nthat these voters are disproportionately ‘women, older, and of lower income and education\nattainment,’” groups which the plaintiffs represented.        Id. (internal citation omitted).   The\ndefendants in that case also argued that the plaintiffs would not actually be precluded from\nvoting as required by McDonald because they had “ample” other means of voting, including by\nmail, voting EIP at other times, or on Election Day. Id. However, we held not clearly erroneous\nthe district court’s conclusion that early voters would not be able to exercise their right to vote in\nperson because the challenged Directive also eliminated all evening and weekend hours of EIP\nvoting, times during which early voters would likely have voted in the past because they tend to\nhave lower incomes and less education than election day voters. Id.\n\n       We did not read McDonald to require proof that there was no possibility that the\nplaintiffs would find a way to adjust and vote through the remaining options. We acknowledged\nthat the challenged law “does not absolutely prohibit early voters from voting,” but focused on\nthe evidence in the record that the plaintiffs’ “ability to cast a ballot is impeded by Ohio’s\nstatutory scheme.” Id. at 433. To the extent that McDonald spoke in terms of “precluding” an\nindividual from voting, which might imply the necessity of such proof, we note that McDonald\nwas decided before the development of the Anderson-Burdick test. Thus, the McDonald Court\napplied a two-tier test for evaluating restrictions on the right to vote, rational basis review for no\nburdens and strict scrutiny for “severe” burdens, a threshold that more clearly invites\nconsideration of “preclusion.” However, as noted above, that two-tier test has evolved into the\nAnderson-Burdick framework, under which burdens that fall between those two extremes can\nstill be found to violate the Equal Protection Clause. In more recent cases, the Supreme Court\nhas not required absolute certainty in predicting how many voters would be prevented from\nvoting by laws that impose burdens on the right to vote. See, e.g., Crawford, 553 U.S. at 221\n(Souter, J., dissenting) (stating that “Petitioners, to be sure, failed to nail down precisely how\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v.

Thus, in this case the district court properly held that whether\nvoters might adjust to vote during a different time in EIP voting such that overall turnout might\nnot be affected “is not determinative of the Equal Protection analysis.” R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and\nOrder at 50) (Page ID #5897).3\n\n         Like the plaintiffs in Obama for America, Plaintiffs in this case presented ample evidence\nthat African American, lower-income, and homeless voters disproportionately have used in past\nelections the EIP voting times that Directive 2014-17 and SB 238 eliminated, and that the\nnumber of individuals who had previously voted during these periods was not insignificant. For\nexample, the number of voters in Golden Week alone ranged from 26,230 in 2010 to 89,224 in\n2012. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 50) (Page ID #5897). And the regulations at issue in the\ncase reduce the overall time for EIP voting more than the three days that had been eliminated in\nObama for America. Moreover, unlike the plaintiffs in Obama for America, Plaintiffs also\npresented evidence to show that voting by mail is not actually a viable “alternative means of\naccess to the ballot” for the groups they represent. Cf. Obama for America, 697 F.3d at 440\n\n         3\n           In a relatively recent case, the Second Circuit considered a claim that a New York statute allowing\nabsentee voting for all elections except elections for political party county committees violated the First Amendment\nby impermissibly burdening New York citizens’ right to vote.

Id. at 108-09 (“The defendants assert that pure rational basis review should be utilized in this case in\nreviewing the constitutionality of Election Law § 7–122. They are incorrect. Under Burdick’s ‘flexible standard,’\nthe court must actually ‘weigh’ the burdens imposed on the plaintiff against ‘the precise interests put forward by the\nState,’ and the court must take ‘into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the\nplaintiff’s rights.’”) (internal citation omitted) (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789).\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v.

Ct.\nOp. and Order at 54) (Page ID #5901). Additionally, the district court considered the fact that\n“[t]he associated costs and more complex mechanics of voting by mail, coupled with other\ninformation in the record concerning the enumerated groups including homelessness, lower\neducational attainment, more limited financial resources, reliance on public transportation, and\ntransience” to bolster its conclusion that “voting by mail may not be a suitable alternative for\nmany voters.” Id. The record also reflected that lower-income voters, because of their reliance\non public transportation and higher likelihood of working in wage-based jobs, would face\nsubstantial difficulties in voting between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Id. at 53 (Page ID #5900). Under\nObama for America, then, the district court properly concluded that Plaintiffs had presented\nsufficient evidence that the groups they represent are in fact significantly burdened by Directive\n2014-17 and SB 238 such that McDonald’s rational basis standard does not apply.4\n\n2. Crawford Does Not Foreclose Applying Anderson-Burdick Review\n\n         In Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, we squarely addressed the applicability of\nAnderson-Burdick to facially neutral restrictions on voting. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">696</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The State defendant\nin that case argued that the challenged practice—“Ohio’s automatic disqualification rule for\nwrong-precinct ballots”—“treats all voters equally and therefore does not involve any\n\n\n         4\n          To the extent that the district court relied on Judge White’s concurrence in Obama for America and Bush\nv. Gore as a separate rationale for its decision, see id. at 49–50 (Page ID #5896–97), we first note that that analysis\nis not necessary to our holding that the district court properly did not apply McDonald’s rational basis standard of\nreview. At the same time, we do think the broader context in which Ohio statutorily imposed EIP voting—as a\nremedial measure to address such long lines for voting in 2004 that many voters simply gave up trying to vote—is\nrelevant as additional evidence suggesting that voters whom Plaintiffs represent may not in fact easily adjust to\nvoting on Election Day if SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 were to remain in effect. Moreover, while Bush v. Gore\ndid involve disparate treatment, rather than burdens on the fundamental right to vote, we nonetheless find its\nmotivating principle instructive in the present case given that the Equal Protection Clause can be triggered by either\ndisparate treatment or burdens. That is, “[h]aving once granted the right to vote on equal terms”—such as\nexpanding early voting opportunities—“the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one\nperson’s vote over that of another”—for example, by making it substantially harder for certain groups to vote than\nothers. Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. at 104–05.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 21\n\nclassification that could violate the equal protection standard.” Id. at 592 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In responding to this argument, we explained that\n\n       [T]he State overlooks the fact that a clear majority of the Supreme Court in\n       Crawford applied some form of Burdick’s burden-measuring equal protection\n       standard to Indiana’s facially neutral voter-identification requirement. See\n       553 U.S. at 189–91 (Stevens, J., announcing the judgment of the Court), 204\n       (Scalia, J., joined by Alito and Thomas, JJ., concurring in the judgment) (“To\n       evaluate a law respecting the right to vote—whether it governs voter\n       qualifications, candidate selection, or the voting process—we use the approach set\n       out in Burdick. . . .”), 211 (Souter, J., dissenting).\n\nId. Because the plaintiffs in that case had “‘demonstrated that their right to vote is . . . burdened\nby Ohio’s law that rejects wrong-precinct ballots regardless of poll-worker error,” we held that\n“[t]he Anderson-Burdick standard . . . applies.” Id. (quoting Obama for America, 697 F.3d at\n430); see also Obama for America, 697 F.3d at 428–29 (stating that the “[t]he Equal Protection\nClause applies when a state either classifies voters in disparate ways or places restrictions on the\nright to vote”) (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). However, as the plaintiffs in\nNortheast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless asserted that the law at issue created a burden on\nprovisional voters generally, rather than on a subclass of provisional voters, we did not address\nDefendants’ more specific argument here that Anderson-Burdick requires a showing of a burden\non voters generally.\n\n       Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, a majority of the Court in Crawford did not expressly\nhold that a challenger must demonstrate that a voting restriction burdens voters generally in order\nto trigger scrutiny under Anderson-Burdick.          The opinion authored by Justice Stevens\nannouncing the judgment of the Court, which gained only two other votes, did not explicitly\nreject the petitioners’ argument that the middle level of scrutiny under the Anderson-Burdick\nbalancing test could be triggered by evidence of burdens on a subgroup of voters, instead of all\nvoters; rather, the Court held that “on the basis of the evidence in the record it is not possible to\nquantify either the magnitude of the burden on this narrow class of voters or the portion of the\nburden imposed on them that is fully justified.” Crawford, 553 U.S. at 200; see also id. at 202\n(“In sum, on the basis of the record that has been made in this litigation, we cannot conclude that\nthe statute imposes ‘excessively burdensome requirements’ on any class of voters.”) (emphasis\nadded) (citation omitted). Thus, Justice Stevens weighed the evidence of minimal burdens of the\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.           Page 22\n\nlaw on voters generally, the vast majority of whom had IDs, and found that burden justified by\nthe state’s interests. Id. at 202. In contrast, Justice Scalia’s concurrence, which two other\nJustices joined, expressly would have required the plaintiffs to demonstrate that voters generally\nwere burdened for the Anderson-Burdick balancing test to apply. Id. at 205–06 (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring). Justice Scalia cited decisions of the Court outside of the elections context holding\nthat a generally applicable law does not violate the Equal Protection Clause when it merely\ndisproportionately burdens a subgroup of people absent evidence of discriminatory intent. Id. at\n207–08. Justice Souter’s dissent, joined by Justice Ginsburg, assumed that Anderson-Burdick\nbalancing could be triggered by burdens on subgroups, and disagreed with Justice Stevens that\nthe petitioners had not presented sufficient evidence of a more than minimal burden on the\nsubgroup of voters they represented. Id. at 237 (Souter, J., dissenting).\n\n       Thus, a majority of the justices in Crawford either did not expressly reject or in fact\nendorsed the idea that a burden on only a subgroup of voters could trigger balancing review\nunder Anderson-Burdick. Alternatively, as the narrowest basis of the judgment of the Court,\nJustice Stevens’s opinion may be viewed as “the holding of the Court” given the “fragmented”\nCrawford opinions. See, e.g., Marks v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193 (1977) (“When a\nfragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of\nfive Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members\nwho concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBoth Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia held that the Indiana law was constitutional, but Justice\nScalia reached further and held that challengers to a voting restriction must show that it burdens\nvoters generally. Thus, Justice Stevens’s opinion is narrower. See Frank v. Walker, --- F. Supp.\n2d ----, No. 11-CV-01128, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1775432</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (E.D. Wis. Apr. 29, 2014) (holding that\nJustice Stevens’s opinion in Crawford is the narrower ground for the opinion under Marks).\nFinally, it is worth noting that in Anderson, the Supreme Court in fact assessed the burden\nimposed by the challenged law by looking to its impact on a subgroup of voters. Anderson,\n460 U.S. at 792 (holding that “[i]t is clear, then, that the March filing deadline places a particular\nburden on an identifiable segment of Ohio’s independent-minded voters,” specifically\nAnderson’s supporters, but not assessing whether the deadline burdens all voters).\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                      Page 23\n\n         Therefore, that Plaintiffs presented evidence only of SB 238 and Directive 2014-17’s\nburdens on African American, lower-income, and homeless voters does not automatically mean\nthat only rational basis review or standard Equal Protection Clause analysis applies. Crawford\nmerely stands for the proposition that Plaintiffs must present more evidence than the petitioners\ndid in that case to show that the subgroups of voters they represent are more than minimally\nburdened.\n\n         As discussed previously, Plaintiffs presented extensive statistical, survey, and anecdotal\nevidence that SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 will disproportionately burden the ability of African\nAmerican, lower-income, and homeless individuals to vote. The petitioners in Crawford had not\npresented any evidence in the record that even estimated the number of individuals who lacked\nidentification cards. Crawford, 553 U.S. at 200. Nor did the affidavits or depositions in the\nrecord of lower-income individuals or elderly voters in Crawford substantiate that they in fact\nfaced difficulties in obtaining identification cards.              Id. at 201.      In contrast, Plaintiffs here\npresented statistical and survey evidence that indicated that thousands of individuals whom they\nrepresent had voted in past elections during the times that have been eliminated by SB 238 and\nDirective 2014-17, as well as numerous depositions, affidavits, and expert testimony\ndocumenting that the groups Plaintiffs represent have relied on the eliminated EIP voting times\nand would face difficulties in voting without them.5\n\n         In sum, we hold that the district court’s characterization of the overall burden imposed by\nSB 238 and Directive 2014-17 as significant, but not severe, was not clearly erroneous given the\nextensive evidence in the record of the burdens African American, lower-income, and homeless\nvoters will face in voting, absent the times eliminated by SB 238 and Directive 2014-17.6 It\n\n         5\n           The other cases Defendants cite as supporting its argument that the burdens in this case are not significant\nare easily distinguishable.

Of course, the best comparison to the\npresent case for evaluating burdens is Obama for America, and as we discussed above, Plaintiffs in this case\npresented even more evidence than the plaintiffs in that case did to substantiate their claim that the voting rights of\ngroups they represent are in fact significantly burdened by SB 238 and Directive 2014-17.\n         6\n          Defendants assert in their Reply Brief that “Plaintiffs identify no case that treats the ultimate finding of\nwhether a burden is severe (and subject to strict scrutiny), significant (and subject to intermediate scrutiny), or\nminimal (and subject to rational-basis review) as one appropriate for fact-finding.” Appellants Reply Br. at 6. In\nfact, in Obama for America, we did precisely that:\n\fNo. 14-3877        Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                      Page 24\n\ntherefore properly applied the Anderson-Burdick balancing test. We next turn to the district\ncourt’s evaluation of Defendants’ asserted justifications for SB 238 and Directive 2014-17.\n\n3. The State’s Justifications Do Not Outweigh the Significant Burden on Voters\n\n        Once a court has determined that a law burdens voters, under Anderson-Burdick those\nburdens must be weighed against “the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications\nfor the burden imposed by its rule,” taking into consideration “the extent to which those interests\nmake it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.” Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789 (emphasis added).\nPut differently, the state must articulate specific, rather than abstract state interests, and explain\nwhy the particular restriction imposed is actually necessary, meaning it actually addresses, the\ninterest put forth. See Obama for America, 697 F.3d at 433–34 (assessing under Anderson-\nBurdick whether the state had presented actual evidence to support the justifications it provided\nfor the challenged law).\n\n        Before even articulating these interests, Defendants appear to argue that we held in\nObama for America that a law such as SB 238 or Directive 2014-17 would automatically survive\nthis scrutiny of state interests. Appellants Br. at 21 (quoting our statement in Obama for\nAmerica, 697 F.3d at 433–34, that “If the State had enacted a generally applicable,\nnondiscriminatory voting regulation that limited in-person early voting for all Ohio voters, its\n‘important regulatory interests’ would likely be sufficient to justify the restriction.’”). That\nstatement, of course, was not central to our holding in that case and does not control the present\ncase. Moreover, the quoted language in that sentence is in fact from Burdick. 504 U.S. at 434\n(stating that “when [a regulation] imposes only ‘reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions’ upon\n[voting rights], the State’s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the\nrestrictions”) (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788). The key in that statement is the word\n\n\n        The State argues that the burden on non-military voters is slight because they have “ample” other\n        means to cast their ballots, including by requesting and mailing an absentee ballot, voting in\n        person prior to the final weekend before Election Day, or on Election Day itself. However, the\n        district court concluded that because early voters have disproportionately lower incomes and less\n        education than election day voters, and because all evening and weekend voting hours prior to the\n        final weekend were eliminated by Directive 2012–35, “thousands of voters who would have voted\n        during those three days will not be able to exercise their right to cast a vote in person.” Based on\n        the evidence in the record, this conclusion was not clearly erroneous.\nObama for America, 697 F.3d at 431 (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted).\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.           Page 25\n\ngenerally; the Burdick Court was merely making clear that not all restrictions on voting will be\nstruck down simply because they impose any kind of burden, as states do have the power to\nregulate elections generally. Burdick itself involved a nondiscriminatory restriction on write-in\nvoting, and the Court still probed the state’s asserted justifications for the restriction in the\nmanner required by Anderson. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434. Indeed, in a more recent case, the\nSupreme Court has tied this statement’s applicability to situations in which the burden imposed\nis modest. Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145824\"><a href=\"/opinion/145824/wash-state-grange-v-wash-state-rep-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 452\n(2008) (“If a statute imposes only modest burdens, however, then ‘the State’s important\nregulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions’\non election procedures.”) (emphasis added) (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788).\n\n       We also note that how Ohio’s early-voting system compares to that of other states is not\nrelevant under the Anderson-Burdick balancing test. The test directs courts to weigh the burdens\nimposed on voters in a particular state against the justifications that that state has proffered for\nthe challenged law or practice that imposes those burdens. Early voting does not necessarily\nplay the same role in all jurisdictions in ensuring that certain groups of voters are actually able to\nvote. Thus, the same law may impose a significant burden in one state and only a minimal\nburden in another. Similarly, a particular state may have stronger justifications for a law that\nburdens voters than other states with the same law.\n\n       Thus, we will examine in turn each of Defendants’ asserted justifications—preventing\nvoter fraud and containing costs for SB 238, and uniformity for Directive 2014-17—under the\nAnderson-Burdick balancing framework.\n\ni. Fraud\n\n       Regarding SB 238, Defendants argue that it is necessary as a measure to reduce fraud\narising from same-day registration and voting during Golden Week. Appellants Br. at 26;\nGeneral Assembly Br. at 38. Defendants point to the testimony by the OAEO Director that the\n“‘registration deadline’ exists so officials ‘can confirm that a voter is who they say they are\nbefore they cast a ballot.’” Id. at 26 (citing R. 54-4 (Keeran Decl. at 7) (Page ID #1851)).\nDefendants assert that “[w]hen the deadline is later than the start of voting, votes might be\ncounted even though cast ‘by people who fraudulently registered during this period, because the\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 26\n\nelection officials could not confirm their registration status before Election Day.’” Id. The Ohio\nGeneral Assembly points to declarations of individual county election officials that “historically\nvoter fraud was most likely to occur during Golden Week,” R. 68-2 (Ward Decl. ¶ 4) (Page ID\n#5123), or that it is difficult to verify an individual’s residence when someone registers and votes\non the same day, R. 68-3 (Cuckler Decl. ¶ 9) (Page ID #5511), or that some individuals were\nable to cast absentee ballots in one county and then register and cast an EIP Ballot during Golden\nWeek in another county, id. ¶ 8 (Page ID #5510–11). They argue that the Crawford Court\nconsidered similar evidence regarding fraud to hold that the state’s interest in that case was\nsufficiently important to outweigh burdens on voters. Finally, the General Assembly argues that\nthe district court “trivialized or ignored this unrefuted evidence” and improperly substituted its\nown judgment about how fraud from absentee voting could be “best” handled.                 General\nAssembly Br. at 41.\n\n       Weighing the state’s asserted interest in preventing voter fraud against the significant\nburden the elimination of Golden Week places on Plaintiffs, we conclude that Defendants have\nnot met their burden to establish that their interests outweigh these burdens. To be sure, “[t]here\nis no question about the legitimacy or importance of the State’s interest in counting only the\nvotes of eligible voters. . . . While the most effective method of preventing election fraud may\nwell be debatable, the propriety of doing so is perfectly clear.” Crawford, 553 U.S. at 196. This\ndoes not mean, however, that the State can, by merely asserting an interest in preventing voter\nfraud, establish that that interest outweighs a significant burden on voters. Defendants did not\nprovide more than a handful of actual examples of voter fraud, and their general testimony\nregarding the difficulties of verifying voter registration before counting ballots did not clearly\npertain to problems with Golden Week specifically. The district court properly identified that the\nspecific concern Defendants expressed regarding voter fraud—that the vote of an EIP voter\nwould be counted before his or her registration could be verified—was not logically linked to\nconcerns with voting and registering on the same day, but rather “has more to do with the\nregistration process and verification of absentee ballots” generally. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order\nat 56) (Page ID #5903). The court explained that, since Ohio law requires that officials segregate\nabsentee ballots and not count them until registration is verified, see, e.g., R. 53-10 (Directive\n2012-36) (Page ID #1625‒26); R. 58-16 (Clyde Dec. ¶ 16) (Page ID #2169), there is no reason to\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                     Page 27\n\nthink that the registration of voters who registered and voted on the same day during Golden\nWeek would be any harder to verify than an individual who registered on the last permissible day\nand then voted the next day, or for that matter than someone who voted very close to the\nelection. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 56) (Page ID #5903). Defendants did not explain why it\nis harder to segregate and count later the absentee ballots of individuals who vote and register on\nthe same day as opposed to segregating absentee ballots that are returned a different way,\nparticularly given that officials would have at least 30 days to verify the registration of those who\nregister and vote during Golden Week.                 Thus, the district court properly concluded that\nDefendants did not meet their burden of explaining why eliminating Golden Week serves to\nprevent a “precise” problem of voter fraud in a way that is “necessary” to burden the voters\nPlaintiffs’ represent, as opposed to a measure that might more directly target the asserted\nproblem without burdening voters. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789.7\n\n        Moreover, the General Assembly’s argument that Crawford suggests it sufficiently met\nits burden to demonstrate that its interest in fraud prevention outweighs the significant burden on\nPlaintiffs is misplaced. The Crawford Court did not hold that scattered historical examples of\nvoter fraud necessarily establish a sufficient state interest to overcome any burden imposed on\nvoters; given the simply minimal burden that the petitioners had shown on voters in that case, the\nCourt essentially only engaged in a rational basis review of the state’s asserted interest in\npreventing voter fraud, not the more piercing scrutiny that a greater burden would require under\nAnderson-Burdick. Crawford, 553 U.S. at 194–96, 202. Here, in contrast, the district court\nconcluded that the burden on Plaintiffs was significant. Thus, its more searching review of\nDefendants’ asserted justification in preventing voter fraud was warranted.\n\n\n\n\n        7\n           While we do not find that other states’ electoral laws and practices are relevant to our assessment of the\nconstitutionality or legality of SB 238 and Directive 2014-17, we note that Defendants’ own expert Professor\nMcCarty reported that “Ohio is quite an outlier” with regard to its registration deadline. R. 67-1 (McCarty Rebuttal\nRep. at 22) (Page ID #5088). He continues that “[i]n every state except New Mexico, a voter can register and vote\nwithin 15 days of the election. In most cases, this can be accomplished within a week of the election. Ohio and\nNew Mexico are apples to these oranges.” Id. Thus, other states do not appear to be overly concerned with voter\nfraud arising from allowing voters to register even closer to Election Day than Ohio allows.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 28\n\nii. Cost\n\n       Defendants next argue that SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 are necessary as cost\ncontainment measures. They argue that increasing EIP voting would “increase the costs and\nadministrative burdens” on Election Boards, such as requiring additional staff. Appellants Br. at\n25. Defendants also assert that they determined the days and times to eliminate strategically so\nas “to be more efficient with our tax payer dollars” because “[a] relatively smaller proportion of\nvoters . . . voted during the times Ohio eliminated, compared to the times it kept.” Id. at 25. The\nOhio General Assembly adds that the district court improperly dismissed the specific cost\nestimates of retaining EIP voting provided by several local election officials simply because they\n“lack[ed] a frame of reference” and ignored less easily quantifiable burdens of Election Boards\n“having to divert manpower” away from other tasks to administering EIP voting. General\nAssembly Br. at 45. They argue that they did not need to show that they could not handle the\ncosts of the old system, as the district court suggested. Id.\n\n       We also conclude that Defendants’ asserted interest in reducing costs does not adequately\njustify the burdens SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 place on voters. In Obama for America, we\nheld that the State’s asserted interest in reducing costs and administrative burdens did not justify\nthe burdens on voters because there was “no evidence that local boards of elections have\nstruggled to cope with early voting in the past, no evidence that they may struggle to do so\nduring the November 2012 election,” and because at least one local board, Cuyahoga County,\nsaid it had budgeted for EIP voting. 697 F.3d at 433–34. Our focus on whether local boards\nwould “struggle” to handle costs in Obama for America makes clear that it is not enough merely\nto assert that a restriction on voting saves costs. Arguably some cost-saving rationale could be\nidentified in most voting restrictions. Rather, where more than minimal burdens on voters are\nestablished, the State must demonstrate that such costs would actually be burdensome.\n\n       The district court thus properly concluded that Defendants had not demonstrated that they\nwould “struggle” with the costs of maintaining EIP voting. While Defendants presented specific\ncost estimates from a handful of election boards for reinstating Golden Week, the district court\nproperly noted that those figures “lack[ed] a frame of reference” in that Defendants did not\nindicate whether or how those costs would be burdensome overall. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order\n\fNo. 14-3877       Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 29\n\nat 57) (Page ID #5904). Cuyahoga County again filed an amicus brief saying it had already\nbudgeted money for Golden Week and the additional weekend voting days for the 2014 election.\nR. 28 (Am. Cur. Br. Cuyahoga Cnty. at 8–9) (Page ID #600‒01). Nor did Defendants present\nspecific estimates of the costs of maintaining the eliminated days of weekend voting. The\ndistrict court also pointed to evidence in the record that election boards are required by law to be\nopen during Golden Week, and only five of the eighty-eight counties statewide ran EIP voting at\nsites other than their regular offices during the 2008 and 2010 elections. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and\nOrder at 59) (Page ID #5906). Thus, the court reasonably concluded that most election boards\nwould not have to bear substantial extra costs associated with maintaining an offsite location for\nthat period. Id. Moreover, like the State in Obama for America, Defendants did not present\nevidence that the old EIP voting schedule, which included Golden Week and weekend voting,\n“created undue or burdensome costs.” Id. at 58 (Page ID #5905).\n\niii. Uniformity\n\n       Finally, regarding Directive 2014-17, Defendants justify it as necessary to promote\nuniformity. Appellants Br. at 24. Defendants argue that “uniformity makes it easier for the State\nto educate voters about election days and hours.” Id. It also ensures fairness by making sure that\nall voters can vote during the same times across counties. Id. And Defendants argue it reduces\nlitigation risks by ensuring equal treatment of voters. Id.\n\n       Again, we conclude this asserted interest fails to outweigh the burdens on Plaintiffs.\nDefendants present only an abstract interest in uniformity that is not tied to the necessity of SB\n238 and Directive 2014-17 specifically. Uniformity can be important to make voter education\neasier, but Defendants do not explain why a uniform EIP voting schedule could not also include\nGolden Week and the other eliminated EIP voting times.            As the district court explained,\n“uniformity, standing alone,” is not an interest important enough to significantly burden\nPlaintiffs’ ability to vote. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 60) (Page ID #5907); see also Obama\nfor America, 697 F.3d at 442 (White, J., concurring) (“The desire for uniformity has little to do\nwith the elimination of all weekend and after-hours in-person voting. Defendants offer no\nexplanation for curtailing hours other than on the final weekend, and uniformity without some\nunderlying reason for the chosen rule is not a justification in and of itself. Nor is there a showing\n\fNo. 14-3877        Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                   Page 30\n\nthat eliminating all weekend and after-hours voting will in fact produce uniform access, as\nopposed to uniform hours.”).\n\n        In sum, because we have concluded that none of the interests put forth by Defendants\nsufficiently justify the significant burden that the district court found SB 238 and Directive 2014-\n17 place on the voters whom Plaintiffs represent, we find that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on\ntheir Equal Protection Clause claim.\n\nD. Voting Rights Act Section 2 Claim\n\n        Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973,8 provides that “[n]o voting\nqualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or\napplied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement\nof the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . .”\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(a). In 1982, Congress amended the Voting Rights Act to make clear that\n“Section 2, unlike other federal legislation that prohibits racial discrimination, does not require\nproof of discriminatory intent.

REP. NO. 97-417 at 28–29). The Court added, however,\nthat the Senate Report makes clear that “this list of typical factors is neither comprehensive nor\nexclusive” and that “‘there is no requirement that any particular number of factors be proved, or\nthat a majority of them point one way or the other.’” Id. at 45 (quoting S. REP. at 29).\n\n       In finding that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Section 2 claim, the district court\nfirst pointed to evidence in the record of a discriminatory effect on African American voters—\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 32\n\nthat the EIP voting hours and days eliminated by SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 would\n“disproportionately impact African American voters resulting in less opportunity to participate in\nthe political process than other voters.” R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 61) (Page ID #5908).\nThe court pointed to the statistical evidence that African Americans use EIP voting at higher\nrates than others; to the expert testimony of Professor Roscigno and other evidence in the record\nthat African Americans “tend to disproportionately make up the groups that benefit the most\nfrom same-day registration: the poor and the homeless”; that the provision of only one Sunday\nof EIP voting “burdens the voting rights of African Americans by arbitrarily limiting Souls to the\nPolls voting initiatives”; and that, because African Americans are more likely to be of lower-\nsocioeconomic status, they “tend to work hourly jobs and can find it difficult to find time to vote\nduring normal business hours.” Id. at 65–66 (Page ID #5912–13).\n\n        The district court also credited the testimony of Professor Roscigno as establishing\nSenate factors one, two, three, five, six, seven, and nine such that “SB 238 and Directive 2014-17\ninteract with the historical and social conditions facing African Americans in Ohio to reduce the\nopportunity to participate in the political process relative to other groups of voters.” R. 72 (D.\nCt. Op. and Order at 65) (Page ID #5912). While again conceding that Plaintiffs had not\nestablished that voter turnout would necessarily be decreased overall, the district court explained\nthat “by its plain terms, § 2 is not necessarily about voter turnout but about opportunity to\nparticipate in the political process compared to other groups.” Id. at 67 (Page ID #5914). And\nPlaintiffs had, the district court concluded, “demonstrated a strong likelihood of establishing that\nthe combined effects of SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 result in fewer opportunities for African\nAmericans to participate in the electoral process.” Id. at 68 (Page ID #5915) (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\n        Defendants make four arguments as to why the district court’s analysis is incorrect. First,\nthey argue that the district court improperly used the EIP voting system as it existed before SB\n238 and Directive 2014-17 as its benchmark against which to measure the discriminatory effect\non African American voters. Appellants Br. at 39. In so doing, Defendants assert, the district\ncourt used a “retrogression” standard, which is permissible only under Section 5 of the Voting\nRights Act. Id. at 39–42. Second, Defendants contend that the canon of constitutional avoidance\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 33\n\nand federalism counsel in favor of not reading Section 2 to reach changes to early-voting systems\nat all. Id. at 44. Third, Defendants argue that the district court “should not have looked at [the\nSenate] factors at all to resolve this vote-denial claim.” Id. at 53 (emphasis in original). Finally,\nfocusing on the 2010 election data, Defendants contend that “Plaintiffs’ own evidence shows that\nit cannot prove causation.” Id. at 55.\n\n       1. The Test for a Section 2 Vote Denial Claim\n\n       Section 2 applies to any discriminatory “standard, practice, or procedure . . . which\nresults in a denial or abridgement” of the right to vote. 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a) (emphasis added).\nAbridgement’s “core meaning is ‘shorten,’” Reno v.

(“Bossier II”),\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118334\"><a href=\"/opinion/118334/reno-v-bossier-parish-school-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333–34 (2000), or “[t]o reduce or diminish,” Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed.\n2009). Similarly, Section 2(b) directs courts to consider whether members of a protected class\nhave “less opportunity” to exercise their right to vote than other groups of voters, not simply\nwhether protected voters only have no opportunity to vote. 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b) (emphasis\nadded). In other words, Section 2 applies to any “standard, practice, or procedure” that makes it\nharder for an eligible voter to cast a ballot, not just those that actually prevent individuals from\nvoting. Cf. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45 n.10 (“Section 2 prohibits all forms of voting discrimination,\nnot just vote dilution.”); S. REP. NO. 97-417 at 30 (“Section 2 remains the major statutory\nprohibition of all voting rights discrimination.”).\n\n       Courts have therefore found a range of “standard[s], practice[s], or procedure[s]” that\nmake it harder, but not necessarily impossible, for eligible voters to vote to fall within Section 2.\nSee, e.g., Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v.

Nevertheless, we briefly address both arguments for the sake of completeness.\n\n        As discussed above, the plain language of Section 2 does not exempt early-voting\nsystems from its coverage. Section 2 applies to any discriminatory “standard, practice, or\nprocedure . . . which results in a denial or abridgement” of the right to vote. 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a).\nIt does not specify that certain “standard[s], practice[s], or procedure[s]” are included within its\nscope and others excluded. The Voting Rights Act contains a similarly broad definition of the\nright to vote:\n\n        The terms “vote” or “voting” shall include all action necessary to make a vote\n        effective in any primary, special, or general election, including, but not limited to,\n        registration, listing pursuant to this chapter, or other action required by law\n        prerequisite to voting, casting a ballot, and having such ballot counted properly\n        and included in the appropriate totals of votes cast with respect to candidates for\n        public or party office and propositions for which votes are received in an election.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973l(c)(1).

Finally, we note that the plain text of the National\nVoter Registration Act does not contain a clear statement to the opposite effect; it specifically\nstates that “[n]othing in this chapter authorizes or requires conduct that is prohibited by the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965.” 52 U.S.C. § 20510(d)(2).\n\n       Turning to the case law on Section 2, then, we note that the vast majority of cases have\nconcerned a different kind of claim—vote dilution. Vote dilution claims involve challenges to\nmethods of electing representatives—like redistricting or at-large districts—as having the effect\nof diminishing minorities’ voting strength. Unsurprisingly, then, the case law has developed to\nsuit the particular challenges of vote dilution claims. A clear test for Section 2 vote denial\nclaims—generally used to refer to any claim that is not a vote dilution claim—has yet to emerge.\nSee, e.g., Janai S. Nelson, The Causal Context of Disparate Vote Denial, 54 B.C. L. REV. 579,\n\fNo. 14-3877          Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                       Page 36\n\n595 (2013) (“[T]he legal contours of vote denial claims remain woefully underdeveloped as\ncompared to vote dilution claims.”).\n\n         We read the text of Section 2 and the limited relevant case law as requiring proof of two\nelements for a vote denial claim. First, as the text of Section 2(b) indicates, the challenged\n“standard, practice, or procedure” must impose a discriminatory burden on members of a\nprotected class, meaning that members of the protected class “have less opportunity than other\nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of\ntheir choice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a)–(b). Second, the Supreme Court has indicated that that\nburden must in part be caused by or linked to “social and historical conditions” that have or\ncurrently produce discrimination against members of the protected class.9 Gingles, 478 U.S. at\n47 (“The essence of a § 2 claim is that a certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with\nsocial and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and\nwhite voters to elect their preferred representatives.”). In assessing both elements, courts should\nconsider “the totality of circumstances.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).\n\n         Despite Defendants’ assertions to the contrary, we see no reason why the Senate factors\ncannot be considered in assessing the “totality of the circumstances” in a vote denial claim,\nparticularly with regard to the second element. While the Court has noted that the Senate Report\nindicates that “the enumerated factors will often be pertinent to certain types of § 2 violations,\nparticularly to vote dilution claims,” neither the Report nor the Court suggested that the factors\ncan be considered only in vote dilution claims. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45. And several of the few\nCircuit court decisions to address vote denial claims have expressly stated that the Senate factors\nare relevant to vote denial claims.

To the contrary, the ‘totality of the\ncircumstances’ test established in § 2(b) was initially applied only in ‘vote denial’ claims such as\nthis.”).\n\n           We find Senate factors one, three, five, and nine particularly relevant to a vote denial\nclaim in that they specifically focus on how historical or current patterns of discrimination\n“hinder [minorities’] ability to participate effectively in the political process.” Gingles, 478 U.S.\nat 37 (quoting Senate factor five).         All of the factors, however can still provide helpful\nbackground context to minorities’ overall ability to engage effectively on an equal basis with\nother voters in the political process.\n\n           2. Assessment of Plaintiffs’ Section 2 Claim\n\n           We conclude that the district court properly found that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on\ntheir Section 2 claim.        Plaintiffs demonstrated that SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 will\ndisproportionately burden African American voters and that this burden means that they will\nhave a harder time voting than other members of the electorate. As previously discussed in\nSections II and III, the district court did not clearly err in crediting the statistical and survey\nanalysis of Plaintiffs’ expert Smith and other studies in the record as demonstrating that African\nAmericans vote EIP at higher rates than other groups, including on the eliminated EIP voting\ndays. Nor did the district court clearly err in considering data from the elections in 2008, 2010,\nand 2012 in reaching this conclusion, rather than focusing solely on 2010 as Defendants’\ncausation argument implicitly urges. Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs did not establish\ncausation is therefore without merit. And the fact that African Americans are more likely to be\nof lower-socioeconomic status in Ohio—as Professor Roscigno’s undisputed report establishes—\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                      Page 38\n\nand both distrust voting by mail and face obstacles doing so, means that the remaining EIP\nvoting times are not sufficient to ensure African Americans have a truly equal opportunity to\nvote as other groups of voters. More specifically, African Americans are more likely to vote on\nSundays through the Souls to the Polls initiatives because of the free transportation church\ngroups can provide. Lower-income individuals face difficulties in voting during the day because\nthey are more likely to work in hourly-wage jobs with little flexibility.                           Lower-income\nindividuals, often because they are more likely to move and/or have difficulty accessing\ntransportation, also most need same-day registration. R. 18-2 (Roscigno Rep. at 16–19) (Page ID\n#266–69). Thus, the disproportionate burdens SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 place on African\nAmericans, combined with their lower-socioeconomic status in Ohio, operate to give African\nAmerican voters “less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the\npolitical process and to elect representatives of their choice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).\n\n         Defendants’ argument that the district court failed to identify an objective benchmark\nagainst which to assess the burdens SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 place on African American\nvoters is unpersuasive. The case law Defendants cite on the need for objective benchmarks\ninvolve vote dilution claims. See, e.g., Holder v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117874\"><a href=\"/opinion/117874/holder-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 876 (1994) (“This case\npresents the question whether the size of a governing authority is subject to a vote dilution\nchallenge under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act”); Bossier II, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118334\"><a href=\"/opinion/118334/reno-v-bossier-parish-school-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (considering whether\nSection 5 prohibits preclearance of a dilutive, but nonretrogressive redistricting plan).10 A vote\ndilution claim requires courts to make the difficult judgment of whether a challenged practice\nimpermissibly dilutes minorities’ voting strength, or whether minorities’ lack of electoral success\nin fact simply stems from “mere . . . political defeat at the polls.” Whitcomb v.

Thus, determining what an undiluted benchmark should be can be challenging,\nparticularly because Section 2 expressly states that “nothing in this section establishes a right to\nhave members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the\npopulation.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).\n\n\n         10\n             Defendants’ discussion of the necessity of establishing “preconditions” before assessing the “totality of\ncircumstances” similarly comes from vote dilution cases. See Appellants Reply Br. at 17–19. The “preconditions”\nreferenced in Growe v. Emison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112818\"><a href=\"/opinion/112818/growe-v-emison/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (1993), for example, refer to three requirements the Supreme Court\nset forth in Gingles that apply to vote dilution claims only. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50–51.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 39\n\n       In contrast, Section 2 vote denial claims inherently provide a clear, workable benchmark.\nAgain, under Section 2(b), the relevant inquiry is whether minority voters “have less opportunity\nthan other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect\nrepresentatives of their choice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b) (emphasis added). The benchmark is thus\nquite straightforward—under the challenged law or practice, how do minorities fare in their\nability “to participate in the political process” as compared to other groups of voters?\n\n       Thus, the district court properly assessed whether, under the system established by SB\n238 and Directive 2014-17, African American voters would have less opportunity than other\nOhio voters to cast their ballots. The disproportionate impact on African American voters as\ncompared to white voters of cutting Sunday and evening EIP voting as well as Golden Week is\nclearly relevant to this inquiry. So, too, is the relative ability of African American voters to vote\nthrough the remaining options available under SB 238 and Directive 2014-17.\n\n       Turning to the second element of a Section 2 vote denial claim, the district court also\nproperly found that Plaintiffs had sufficiently demonstrated that the disproportionate burdens SB\n238 and Directive 2014-17 place on African Americans are in part caused by or linked to “social\nand historical conditions” of discrimination. Professor Roscigno’s undisputed report regarding\nSenate factor five is particularly on point. He explained that African Americans in Ohio tend to\nbe of lower-socioeconomic status because of “stark and persistent racial inequalities . . . [in]\nwork, housing, education and health,” inequalities that stem from “both historical and\ncontemporary discriminatory practices.” R. 18-2 (Roscigno Rep. at 3) (Page ID #253). As\nsupport, Professor Roscigno pointed to “[s]ubstantial bodies of social science research . . . [that]\ninvestigate the root causes of . . . occupational inequalities, often concluding that contemporary\ninstitutional practices and discrimination play a significant role, especially when the disparities\nare as large as they are in Ohio.” Id. at 7 (Page ID #257). “Racial occupational inequalities are\neasily linked to racial disparities in, for instance, family income and poverty status as well as\nresidential and schooling options and racial health disparities.” Id. at 10 (Page ID #260). As\npreviously discussed, African Americans’ lower-socioeconomic status in turn plays a key role in\nexplaining why the disproportionate impact of SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 burdens African\nAmericans’ voting opportunities.\n\fNo. 14-3877       Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.        Page 40\n\n        The remaining Senate factors considered by the district court support its finding that the\nburdens SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 place on African American voters are in part caused by\nor linked to “social and historical conditions” that have produced or currently produce\ndiscrimination against African Americans in Ohio. Given that Plaintiffs’ claim focuses on\nreductions in voting opportunities, past and current discrimination linked to the electoral system\nitself is relevant.   Professor Roscigno’s report demonstrated that, per Senate factor one,\nhistorically “[o]fficial voting-related discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities was a\ncornerstone in Ohio.” Id. at 26 (Page ID #276). More recently, Ohio has implemented “voting\npractices that suppress minority political participation,” such as poll watchers and voter ID\nlaws—practices that fall within the ambit of Senate factor three. Id. at 28–30 (Page ID #278–\n80). Under Senate factor nine, it is also relevant that, as explained in the Equal Protection Clause\nanalysis, the policy justifications for SB 238 and Directive 2014-17 are “tenuous.” Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 37. The evidence Professor Roscigno provided regarding Senate factors two, six,\nand seven—while not as clearly linked to Plaintiffs’ claim—further contextualizes the role race\nstill plays in Ohio elections.\n\n        The district court did not improperly engage in a retrogression analysis in considering the\nopportunities available to African Americans to vote EIP under the prior law as part of the\n“totality of circumstances” inquiry. To be sure, Congress intended—and the Court has read—\nSection 2 and Section 5 not to have exactly the same scope. Procedurally, Section 5 requires that\ncovered states obtain preclearance from the Attorney General or the District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia before they change a voting “qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice,\nor procedure.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973c. Section 2 applies to all states and includes no preclearance\nrequirement. “[T]he purpose of § 5 has always been to insure that no voting-procedure changes\nwould be made that would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect\nto their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.” Beer v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109418\"><a href=\"/opinion/109418/beer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141\n(1976). In other words, “§ 5 prevents nothing but backsliding,” whereas Section 2 is aimed at\ncombatting “discrimination more generally.” Bossier II, 528 U.S. at 334–35.\n\n        At the same time, however, no case explicitly holds that prior laws or practices cannot be\nconsidered in the Section 2 “totality of circumstances” analysis. The Supreme Court has in fact\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.

Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145627\"><a href=\"/opinion/145627/league-of-united-latin-american-citizens-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439 (2006)\n(noting that “[t]he changes to District 23 undermined the progress of a racial group that has been\nsubject to significant voting-related discrimination and that was becoming increasingly\npolitically active and cohesive”) (emphasis added).        Neither does the legislative history of\nSection 2 indicate that prior laws or practices cannot factor into the analysis. The Senate Report\nto the 1982 amendments states only that “Plaintiffs could not establish a Section 2 violation\nmerely by showing that a challenged reapportionment or annexation, for example, involved a\nretrogressive effect on the political strength of a minority group.” S. REP. NO. 97-417 at 68\nn.224 (1982) (emphasis added). Oxford English Dictionary defines “merely” as “entirely . . .\nonly (what is referred to) and nothing more.” 9 Oxford English Dictionary 629 (2d ed. 1989). In\nother words, the Report simply establishes that challengers cannot show a Section 2 violation\nonly on the basis of retrogressive effects. Indeed, Senate factor nine in fact invites comparison to\nprior laws.    The Senate Report explains that, in assessing the “tenuous[ness]” of policy\njustification for the challenged law or procedure, the fact that “the procedure markedly departs\nfrom past practices or from practices elsewhere in the jurisdiction . . . bears on the fairness of its\nimpact.” S. REP. NO. 97-417 at 239 n.117 (emphasis added).\n\n       Moreover, the Supreme Court has made clear that “some parts of the § 2 analysis may\noverlap with the § 5 inquiry.” Georgia v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130158\"><a href=\"/opinion/130158/georgia-v-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 478 (2003). Both Section 2\nand Section 5 speak to “abridgement.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a) (Section 2) (“No voting qualification\nor prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any\nState or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of\nany citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . as provided in subsection\n(b) of this section.”) (emphasis added); id. § 1973c(b) (Section 5) (“Any voting qualification or\nprerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting that has the\npurpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States\non account of race or color . . . to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the\nright to vote within the meaning of subsection (a) of this section.”) (emphasis added).\nAbridgement “necessarily entails a comparison.” Bossier II, 528 U.S. at 333–34.\n\fNo. 14-3877         Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.                      Page 42\n\n         Rather, what is distinct between a Section 5 analysis and a Section 2 analysis is the role\nthat prior law plays in the comparison. The retrogression analysis under Section 5 involves\ncomparing voting opportunities enjoyed by minorities under the status quo as compared to voting\nopportunities minorities would have under the electoral system if the proposed change is\nimplemented. The focus is solely on voting opportunities enjoyed by minorities, and whether\nthose opportunities would be reduced under the proposed law. In contrast, under the Section 2\nanalysis, the focus is whether minorities enjoy less opportunity to vote as compared to other\nvoters. The fact that a practice or law eliminates voting opportunities that used to exist under\nprior law that African Americans disproportionately used is therefore relevant to an assessment\nof whether, under the current system, African Americans have an equal opportunity to participate\nin the political process as compared to other voters.\n\n         As discussed above, Plaintiffs have not asserted that SB 238 and Directive 2014-17\nburden their right to vote merely because they take away EIP voting times that used to exist\nunder prior law. Rather, they have presented evidence that the eliminated EIP voting times are\nthose that African Americans disproportionately use, and that racial inequalities in\nsocioeconomic status and other factors make it much more difficult for African Americans to\nvote at the remaining times or through the other methods now available under the status quo as\ncompared to other groups.11 Thus, the district court did not improperly engage in a retrogressive\nanalysis.\n\n         Finally, we find unpersuasive Defendants’ claim that our decision would have far-\nreaching implications beyond Ohio. Defendants fail to cite any Supreme Court or Sixth Circuit\nauthority to support their argument that we must necessarily consider the practices of other states\nwith regard to EIP voting.\n         11\n            For example, Brown v. Detzner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1236</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1251 (M.D. Fla. 2012), one of the cases\nDefendants cite in their retrogression argument, see Appellants Br. at 42, is in fact distinguishable from the present\ncase on this basis. The district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining the\nenforcement of a Florida statute reducing the number of early voting days from twelve to fourteen under prior law to\neight days for the 2012 election on the basis that it violated Section 2. Brown, 895 F. Supp. 2d at 1255. The district\ncourt noted that while the reduction in days could have a discriminatory impact, other elements of the statute—such\nas a provision allowing county election officials to increase the number of voting hours on any given day, which\ncould mean that more morning and evening hours would be available than what existed previously, and that the\nstatute increased Sunday early voting opportunities for the state as a whole—meant that the plaintiffs had not\nprovided enough evidence that minority voters on the whole would have less opportunity to vote than other groups\nof voters. Id. at 1252–55.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.          Page 43\n\n       In fact, the text of Section 2 and Supreme Court decisions indicate that the opposite is\ntrue. The text of Section 2 directs courts to examine whether the political processes “in the State\nor political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class\n. . . in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to\nparticipate.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b) (emphasis added). The focus is on the internal processes of a\nsingle State or political subdivision and the opportunities enjoyed by that particular electorate.\nThe text of Section 2 does not direct courts to compare opportunities across States. The Supreme\nCourt has likewise characterized the determination of whether a practice violates Section 2 as\n“an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of the contested electoral mechanisms.”\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).             The Court\nexplained that “the [Senate] Committee determined that ‘the question whether the political\nprocesses are “equally open” depends upon a searching practical evaluation of the “past and\npresent reality,”’ and on a ‘functional’ view of the political process.” Id. (quoting S. REP. NO.\n97-417 at 30) (internal citations omitted). “This determination is peculiarly dependent upon the\nfacts of each case.” Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Rogers v. Lodge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110790\"><a href=\"/opinion/110790/rogers-v-lodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 621 (1982)).\nSee also Holder, 512 U.S. at 881–82 (“It makes little sense to say . . . that the sole commissioner\nsystem should be subject to a [Section 2] dilution challenge if it is rare—but immune if it is\ncommon.”) (Kennedy, J.); Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 406 (“Because a § 2 analysis requires the\ndistrict court to engage in a ‘searching practical evaluation of the ‘past and present reality,’\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 45, . . . a district court’s examination in such a case is ‘intensely fact-based\nand localized,’ Salt River, 109 F.3d at 591.”).\n\n       Defendants tell us that the Court’s statement in Gingles is not relevant because the Court\nwas considering a vote dilution claim, rather than a vote denial claim like that at issue here.\nAppellants Br. at 52. But they provide no explanation as to why that distinction matters or why\nassessments of early voting systems do not likewise require an intensely localized assessment of\ntheir impact on African American voters.\n\n       Ohio faced unique problems in administering the 2004 elections. The General Assembly\nintroduced early voting in 2005 largely to remedy those problems. In the nearly ten years since,\nEIP voting has come to play a special role in Ohio in ensuring that African Americans have an\n\fNo. 14-3877        Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.        Page 44\n\nequal opportunity to participate in the political process that is not necessarily true elsewhere.\nThere is no reason to think our decision here compels any conclusion about the early-voting\npractices in other states, which do not necessarily share Ohio’s particular circumstances.\n\n          In sum, we conclude that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Section 2 of the Voting\nRights Act claim.\n\nE. The Remaining Preliminary Injunction Factors\n\n          “When a party seeks a preliminary injunction on the basis of a potential constitutional\nviolation, ‘the likelihood of success on the merits often will be the determinative factor.’”\nObama for America, 697 F.3d at 436 (quoting Jones v. Caruso, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1237987\"><a href=\"/opinion/1237987/jones-v-caruso/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 265 (6th Cir.\n2009)).     Although we have concluded that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Equal\nProtection Clause claim and their Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act claim, we still consider the\nremaining three preliminary injunction factors.\n\n          First, we conclude that Plaintiffs have established that they will suffer irreparable harm\nabsent an injunction. “When constitutional rights are threatened or impaired, irreparable injury\nis presumed. A restriction on the fundamental right to vote therefore constitutes irreparable\ninjury.” Id. (internal citations omitted).\n\n          Regarding the final two factors, we conclude that the issuance of the injunction would not\ncause substantial harm to others and that the public interest weighs in its favor. The significant\nburden on the ability to vote of the voters Plaintiffs represent outweighs any burden on\nDefendants, who have failed to demonstrate that BOEs would not be able to administer the extra\ndays and evening hours of EIP voting required by the preliminary injunction, a schedule BOEs\nhad previously administered in past elections. As we explained in Obama for America:\n\n          While states have “a strong interest in their ability to enforce state election law\n          requirements,” Hunter [v. Hamilton Cnty. Bd. of Elections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"183767\"><a href=\"/opinion/183767/hunter-v-hamilton-county-bd-of-elections/\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244\n          (6th Cir. 2011)], the public has a “strong interest in exercising the ‘fundamental\n          political right’ to vote.” Purcell v. Gonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145774\"><a href=\"/opinion/145774/purcell-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (2006) (quoting Dunn,\n          405 U.S. at 336). “That interest is best served by favoring enfranchisement and\n          ensuring that qualified voters’ exercise of their right to vote is successful.”\n          Hunter, 635 F.3d at 244. The public interest therefore favors permitting as many\n          qualified voters to vote as possible.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.         Page 45\n\nObama for America, 697 F.3d at 436–37. We have previously rejected Defendants’ argument\nthat upholding the preliminary injunction risks confusing voters. Ohio State Conference of\nN.A.A.C.P. v. Husted, No. 14-3877, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4494938</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (6th Cir. Sept. 12, 2014).\nRegarding Defendants’ laches argument, we “review[] a district court’s resolution of a laches\nquestion for an abuse of discretion.” Chirco v. Crosswinds Communities, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796543\"><a href=\"/opinion/796543/michael-a-chirco-dominic-j-moceri-v-crosswinds-communities-inc-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 231\n(6th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Defendants have not explained how Plaintiffs\ncould have more quickly produced the voluminous record evidence in this case in support of\ntheir motion for a preliminary injunction, nor have Defendants produced any evidence that\nPlaintiffs purposefully delayed. We therefore find that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in determining that Defendants “ha[d] not shown . . . a lack of diligence” by Plaintiffs\nto move promptly for a preliminary injunction. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op. and Order at 6) (Page ID\n#5853).\n\nF. The District Court’s Remedy\n\n       Defendants suggest in one paragraph in their brief on appeal that the district court’s\npreliminary injunction itself might violate the Equal Protection Clause by allowing BOEs to set\nEIP voting hours in addition to those set forth in the preliminary injunction order and Directive\n2014-17 because BOEs might set unequal EIP voting hours. Appellants Br. at 28–29. This\nargument appears to implicate issues of state law that have not been fully developed on appeal.\nThe Ohio Revised Code authorizes BOEs to set their own EIP voting hours. Ohio Rev. Code\n§§ 3501.10(b), 3501.11. The district court’s order expressly ties its remedy to what is already\npermitted under Ohio law: “Secretary Husted is enjoined from preventing individual county\nBoards of Election from adopting, by a majority vote of their members and in accordance with\nthe procedures established by Ohio election law,” additional EIP voting hours. R. 72 (D. Ct. Op.\nand Order at 71) (Page ID #5918) (emphasis added). Neither party has directly addressed\nSecretary Husted’s authority to impose uniform EIP voting hours despite the provisions of the\nOhio Revised Code that appear to vest discretion in BOEs to set their own hours. Id. at 4 (Page\nID #5851). At this stage in the litigation, with only days until early voting is set to begin, and\nhaving found that all four factors weigh in favor of granting Plaintiffs a preliminary injunction,\nwe do not address this argument at this time.\n\fNo. 14-3877      Ohio State Conference of the NAACP et al. v. Husted et al.   Page 46\n\n                                     III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment granting a\npreliminary injunction.\n\f</pre>",
