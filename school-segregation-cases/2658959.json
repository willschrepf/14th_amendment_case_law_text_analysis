If the public body refuses to\n\nprovide redacted or segregated copies because the process of redacting or segregating\n\nwould impose an unreasonably high burden or expense, the public body must provide the\n\nrequesting party a written response that is sufficiently detailed to justify refusal to honor\n\nthe FOIA request on these grounds.

The FOIA requests focused on\n\ndocuments related to several articles co-authored by WVU Associate Professor Michael\n\nHendryx, Ph.D., suggesting that environmental impacts of surface coal mining play a role\n\nin the health problems of the area’s residents. The parties litigated this matter for two\n\nyears in the Circuit Court of Monongalia County; WVU released certain documents to\n\nHighland but withheld certain other documents, either in whole or in part, claiming they\n\nwere statutorily exempt. Finally, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nWVU, and dismissed this action.\n\n\n\n             On appeal to this Court, Highland raises several assignments of error and\n\nargues the circuit court’s order should be reversed because it is based upon an\n\nunprecedented expansion of the FOIA exemptions. Upon review, we affirm, in part;\n\nreverse, in part; and remand the case for further proceedings. For the reasons discussed\n\nbelow, this Court finds: (1) WVU may invoke the FOIA’s “internal memoranda”\n\nexemption set forth in West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(8) to withhold documents that\n\nreflect Professor Hendryx’s deliberative process; (2) WVU may not claim an “academic\n\nfreedom” privilege to avoid the plain language of the FOIA; (3) the FOIA’s “personal\n\n                                           1\n\n\fprivacy” exemption set forth in West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2) is not applicable to\n\ndocuments containing anonymous peer review comments of the draft articles but those\n\ndocuments are still exempt from disclosure under the FOIA’s “internal memoranda”\n\nexemption; (4) Highland should have been afforded the opportunity to modify its FOIA\n\nrequests before the circuit court dismissed the action; and (5) the circuit court must issue\n\na ruling on Highland’s request for attorney fees and costs. Accordingly, we remand this\n\nmatter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                      I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n                Highland submitted extensive FOIA requests to WVU on February 1, 2012.\n\nHighland requested documents related to eight articles co-authored by Professor\n\nHendryx, Director of the West Virginia Rural Health Research Center, with WVU’s\n\nSchool of Medicine’s Department of Community Medicine. In those articles, Professor\n\nHendryx suggested there was a connection between surface coal mining and birth defects,\n\ncancer, and poor quality of life in the region. 1 Highland requested essentially all\n\n\n       1\n           One of these articles sets forth the following conclusions:\n\n                      Results indicate that previously documented HRQOL\n               [Health Related Quality of Life] disparities in Appalachia’s\n               coal mining areas are concentrated in MTM [Mountaintop\n               Mining] zones in the central part of the region. These\n               disparities partly reflect the chronic socioeconomic\n               weaknesses inherent in coal-dependent economies and\n               highlight the need for efforts at economic diversification in\n               these areas. However, significant disparities persist after\n               control for these risks and suggest that the environmental\n(continued . . .)\n                                             2\n\n\fdocuments related to the initiation, preparation and publication of Professor Hendryx’s\n\narticles. 2\n\n\n\n\n              impacts of MTM may also play a role in the health problems\n              of the area’s population. In April 2010, the EPA\n              [Environmental Protection Agency] issued new guidance\n              regulating MTM that recognized the environmental and\n              community health costs imposed by this practice: the\n              guidance was intended to make new MTM permits much\n              more difficult to obtain. Several weeks after this ruling, the\n              first MTM permit application to come before the EPA was\n              nevertheless approved, leading to concerns from\n              environmental communities that the rules would not be\n              interpreted or enforced as intended. Our results contribute to\n              the evidence base in support of the April EPA decision.\n\nZullig, K.J. and Hendryx, M., et al., Health-Related Quality of Life Among Central\nAppalachian Residents in Mountaintop Mining Counties, 101, No. 5 Am. J. Pub. Health\n848, 852 (May 2011) (footnotes omitted).\n        2\n         Highland submitted two FOIA requests on the same day. In one FOIA request\n(referred to by the parties as the “subpoena-based FOIA request”), Highland requested\nthe release of the same information that had been the subject of three subpoenas\npreviously served on WVU by Highland in December of 2011. Articles co-authored by\nProfessor Hendryx were used to challenge Highland’s proposal to expand its Reylas\nsurface coal mine in Logan County, West Virginia, in a civil action filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. Ohio Valley Environ.\nCoal., Inc., et al. v. U.S. Army Corps. of Eng’s, Civil Action No. 3:11-cv-0149 (S.D.\nW.Va. 2011). The plaintiffs in that litigation sought to add a new claim to their complaint\nbased upon adverse health effects associated with surface coal mining. Highland served\nthree subpoenas on non-party WVU seeking information regarding the three articles cited\nby the plaintiffs in that lawsuit. After the district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to\nadd health-based claims to their complaint, Highland withdrew the subpoena request in\nJanuary of 2012. However, Highland advised WVU that it would file a FOIA request\nseeking the same information.\n        In the subpoena-based FOIA request, Highland requested all documents related to\nthe initiation, preparation and publication of those articles; it requested the curriculum\nvitae of the study authors, the data used in the statistical analysis presented in the subject\n(continued . . .)\n                                              3\n\n\f             By e-mails dated March 2, 2012, WVU refused to release any documents\n\nresponsive to the FOIA requests. WVU asserted the documents were exempt from\n\ndisclosure under the following FOIA exemptions: (1) information of a personal nature,\n\nWest Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2); (2) information specifically exempt from disclosure\n\nby statute, West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(5); (3) internal memoranda, West Virginia\n\nCode § 29B-1-4(a)(8); and (4) trade secrets, West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(1).\n\n\n\n             On April 12, 2012, Highland instituted this action against WVU, seeking\n\ndisclosure of the documents it requested pursuant to the FOIA. WVU filed a motion to\n\ndismiss on August 3, 2012, claiming the FOIA requests were overly broad and unduly\n\nburdensome; Highland filed a motion for summary judgment on September 11, 2012.\n\nFollowing a hearing on these motions, the circuit court rejected WVU’s claim of undue\n\nburden. The circuit court stated WVU was “stonewalling” Highland by refusing to\n\nprovide any responsive documents. By order entered November 7, 2012, the circuit court\n\ndenied WVU’s motion to dismiss and deferred a ruling on Highland’s motion for\n\n\narticles, including data discussed but not shown, documents and communications related\nto the selection or rejection of particular mining areas to be examined in the studies,\ncommunications with members of specifically-identified third-party organizations in the\ncourse of preparing the articles, and documents related to the door-to-door health\ninterviews conducted pursuant to the Self-Reported Cancer Study, including sample\ninterview forms and the completed forms.\n        In its other FOIA request (referred to by the parties as the “communications FOIA\nrequest”), Highland requested letters, e-mails and other communications sent to or from\nProfessor Hendryx pertaining to five other articles that he co-authored. In addition, the\ncommunications FOIA request sought peer review comments on drafts of Professor\nHendryx’s articles.\n\n                                           4\n\n\fsummary judgment. The circuit court required that WVU release any responsive\n\ninformation to Highland, and if any responsive documents were withheld from disclosure\n\nor redacted, that WVU provide a Vaughn index3 and explanative affidavit.\n\n\n\n             Thereafter, WVU retained the services of a document management\n\ncompany to electronically manage the production of documents for Highland’s FOIA\n\nrequests. Over the course of this litigation, WVU has made five productions of\n\ndocuments to Highland, producing some 2,364 documents, totaling 11,090 pages. Four of\n\nthose document productions 4 included a separate Vaughn index and corresponding\n\naffidavit, explaining WVU’s decision to redact 119 documents and withhold 772\n\ndocuments.\n\n      3\n         See Syl. Pt. 6, Farley v. Worley, 215 W.Va. 412, 599 S.E.2d 835 (2004) (“When\na public body asserts that certain documents or portions of documents in its possession\nare exempt from disclosure under any of the exemptions contained in W.Va. Code, 29B­\n1-4 (2002 Repl.Vol.) (2003 Supp.), the public body must produce a Vaughn index named\nfor Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir.1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977, 94 S.Ct.\n1564, 39 L.Ed.2d 873 (1974). The Vaughn index must provide a relatively detailed\njustification as to why each document is exempt, specifically identifying the reason(s)\nwhy an exemption under W.Va. Code, 29B-1-4 is relevant and correlating the claimed\nexemption with the particular part of the withheld document to which the claimed\nexemption applies.

Code § 29B-1-2(4).\n\n                                           5\n\n\f             On April 3, 2013, Highland filed a renewed motion for summary judgment,\n\narguing the Vaughn indices that WVU provided were facially insufficient and that most,\n\nif not all, of the exemptions cited by WVU were not applicable. Following briefing, the\n\ncircuit court held a hearing on this motion. On May 30, 2013, the circuit court entered an\n\n“Agreed Order Regarding Preparation of Sample Vaughn Index.” The circuit court\n\nrequired WVU to provide a sample Vaughn index with respect to a limited number of\n\nwithheld documents; this Vaughn index was to include a more detailed explanation of\n\neach withheld document, specifically, how each cited exemption applied to justify the\n\nrespective withholding.\n\n\n\n             On July 17, 2013, WVU provided the sample Vaughn index and the\n\naffidavit of WVU’s associate general counsel. The sample Vaughn index listed ninety-\n\nthree documents that were redacted or withheld from production. According to WVU,\n\nsome documents were withheld on the basis of the FOIA’s “internal memoranda”\n\nexemption, some documents were withheld on the basis of “academic freedom” privilege,\n\nand some documents were withheld on the basis of the FOIA’s “trade secret” exemption.\n\n\n\n             On November 6, 2013, the circuit court entered an “Agreed Order\n\nRegarding Briefing on Outstanding Issues,” pursuant to which it required both parties to\n\nfile renewed motions for summary judgment. Thereafter, the parties filed briefs and\n\nidentified those documents listed on the sample Vaughn index they wanted the circuit\n\ncourt to review in camera.\n                                            6\n\n\f             In Highland’s memorandum of law in support of its renewed motion for\n\nsummary judgment, Highland provided the following factual background regarding its\n\nrequest for documents concerning Professor Hendryx’s work:\n\n                     At all relevant times, Michael Hendryx, Ph.D., was a\n             professor employed by the defendant West Virginia\n             University School of Medicine (“WVU”) who holds degrees\n             in psychology but is not a medical doctor, toxicologist, or\n             epidemiologist. Prof. Hendryx was the Director of the West\n             Virginia Rural Health Research Center, where he and his\n             colleagues received public funds to research rural health\n             issues. In that capacity, Hendryx published taxpayer-funded\n             papers such as those that are the subject of the FOIA\n             Requests, focused on linking coal mining and adverse health\n             impacts. His goal – in his own words – is to convince\n             “politicians” that West Virginia “can have a better economy if\n             we work to create a more diverse economy that does not\n             depend on coal.” He further hopes his studies help eliminate\n             mountaintop removal mining and focus policymakers away\n             from coal and towards “cleaner” forms of energy. He thinks\n             that “tighter standards on emissions controls is an important\n             outcome of [his] research.” He hopes “to get [his papers]\n             more in the eyes of state policy makers” so that “the\n             Appalachian people and governments could consider whether\n             our reliance on coal mining for the economy is a good idea or\n             not.” (footnotes and citations omitted).\n\nHighland requested that the circuit court order WVU to provide all responsive documents\n\nlisted on the sample Vaughn index, arguing they do not fall under any applicable FOIA\n\nexemption. Highland also requested that the circuit court order WVU to confer with\n\nHighland regarding the retrieval and review of additional responsive materials that have\n\nyet to be gathered in response to the FOIA request. Finally, Highland asserted the circuit\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\n\fcourt should award it attorney fees and costs in accordance with West Virginia Code §\n\n29B-1-7 because WVU improperly denied Highland access to the public records.\n\n\n\n              In WVU’s memorandum of law in support of its renewed motion for\n\nsummary judgment, WVU argued:\n\n                     The majority of the documents were withheld or\n              redacted because they contain the preliminary deliberations\n              and research of an academic professor. Specifically, these\n              documents include draft research papers and correspondence\n              between co-authors with comments or suggestions regarding\n              the drafts themselves. Like other state employees (perhaps\n              even more so), these faculty members must be permitted the\n              latitude to craft and hone their work in an environment that\n              fosters the free exchange of ideas.\n\nThus, WVU claimed the documents withheld were exempt from disclosure under the\n\n“internal memoranda” exemption of the FOIA, and/or an “academic freedom” privilege.5\n\nWVU also argued that Highland’s FOIA requests were unduly burdensome because\n\nWVU identified over 240,000 documents that were potentially responsive to Highland’s\n\nrequests and “[t]o date, WVU [had] reviewed 43,733 documents in a process that . . .\n\nspanned the pendency of this case.”\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         In this pleading, WVU did not contend the documents were withheld based on\nthe FOIA’s “trade secret” exemption. WVU stated that although this exemption had been\nasserted previously, it no longer believed the circuit court had to specifically address this\nissue because the same documents covered by the “trade secret” exemption were subject\nto other exemptions asserted by WVU.\n\n                                             8\n\n\f              Following an in camera review of the documents,6 the circuit court entered\n\nan order on March 19, 2014, granting summary judgment to WVU and denying\n\nHighland’s cross-motion. The circuit court held that WVU had properly refused to\n\nprovide all withheld and redacted documents on the basis of: (1) the FOIA’s “internal\n\nmemoranda” exemption found at West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(8); (2) an “academic\n\nfreedom” privilege it incorporated into the FOIA’s “personal privacy” exemption found\n\nat West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2); and/or (3) the FOIA requests were unduly\n\nburdensome. The circuit court did not address Highland’s motion for attorney fees and\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n              On appeal to this Court, Highland raises eight assignments of error. 7\n\nHighland urges this Court to reverse the order of the circuit court and find that WVU\n\n\n         6\n         We note the availability and scope of in camera review is within the discretion of\nthe circuit court. Such review offers a check on the accuracy and honesty of the public\nbody’s asserted exemptions. In camera review is conducted incident to, rather than as a\nsubstitute for, the Vaughn index.\n         7\n         Highland contends: (1) the “internal memoranda” exemption under the FOIA\ndoes not apply to matters involving scientific research and publication of articles by state\nuniversity professors; (2) there is no “academic freedom” exemption under the FOIA; (3)\nthe guarantee of a “thorough and efficient system of free schools” under the West\nVirginia Constitution does not extend to institutions of higher education such as WVU,\nand cannot serve as the basis for an “academic freedom” exemption under the FOIA; (4)\nthe “personal privacy” exemption under the FOIA cannot be applied when no personal or\nidentifying information is sought or threatened to be released; (5) the circuit court failed\nto impose the burden of proof on WVU to establish the applicability of the cited FOIA\nexemptions; (6) WVU either waived its reliance on the “trade secret” exemption under\nthe FOIA or failed to establish it; (7) the circuit court erred in reversing its earlier ruling\nand finding – nearly two years after this action was filed – that Highland’s FOIA requests\n(continued . . .)\n                                               9\n\n\fmust provide the documents requested below.            Highland maintains it needs this\n\ninformation in order to evaluate the internal validity of the studies and the conclusions\n\nreached in Professor Hendryx’s articles. Highland also requests that it be granted its\n\nreasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in prosecuting this action, pursuant to West\n\nVirginia Code § 29B-1-7.\n\n\n\n                             II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n              “Summary judgment is the preferred method of resolving cases brought\n\nunder FOIA.” Farley v. Worley, 215 W.Va. 412, 418, 599 S.E.2d 835, 841 (2004)\n\n(quoting Evans v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 276 F.Supp.2d 34, 37 (D.D.C.2003)). An order\n\ngranting summary judgment engenders plenary review. “A circuit court’s entry of\n\nsummary judgment is reviewed de novo.” Syl. Pt. 1, Painter v. Peavy, 192 W.Va. 189,\n\n451 S.E.2d 755 (1994).\n\n\n\n                                   III. DISCUSSION\n\n              The FOIA requires the release of public records upon request. See AT&T\n\nCommc’ns of W.Va., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 188 W.Va. 250, 253, 423 S.E.2d 859,\n\n862 (1992) (“The general policy of th[e] act is to allow as many public records as\n\npossible to be made available to the public.” (footnote omitted)).\n\n\n\nwere unduly burdensome; and (8) the circuit court should have awarded Highland\nattorney fees and costs as a successful FOIA litigant. For the sake of brevity, this Court\nhas consolidated these assignments of error.\n\n                                            10\n\f              Pursuant to the FOIA, “[e]very person has a right to inspect or copy any\n\npublic record of a public body in this State, except as otherwise expressly provided by . . .\n\n[W.Va. Code § 29B-1-4][.]” W.Va. Code, § 29B-1-3(1). A FOIA requester is not\n\nrequired to explain why a record should be disclosed or for what purpose a record is\n\nbeing requested. 8 The FOIA sets forth nineteen specific exemptions to its general\n\ndisclosure provisions. See id. § 29B-1-4.\n\n\n\n              This Court has made clear that the FOIA’s exemptions are to be strictly\n\nconstrued, while the FOIA’s disclosure provisions are to be liberally construed:\n\n                      “‘The disclosure provision of this State’s Freedom of\n              Information Act, W.Va. Code, 29B-1-1 et seq., as amended,\n              [is] to be liberally construed, and the exemptions to such Act\n              are to be strictly construed. W.Va. Code, 29B-1-1.’ Syl. Pt. 4,\n              Hechler v. Casey, 175 W.Va. 434, 333 S.E.2d 799 (1985).”\n              Syl. pt. 5, Queen v. West Virginia University Hospitals, 179\n              W.Va. 95, 365 S.E.2d 375 (1987).\n\nSyl. Pt. 1, Daily Gazette Co. v. W.Va. Dev. Office, 198 W.Va. 563, 482 S.E.2d 180 (1996)\n\n(“Daily Gazette I”). The burden of proof falls on the public body asserting the exemption\n\nto demonstrate that the public record should be protected from disclosure: “The party\n\nclaiming exemption from the general disclosure requirement under West Virginia Code §\n\n\n\n\n       8\n         An exception to this general rule occurs when a request pertains to documents\nfalling under the FOIA’s “personal privacy” exemption, West Virginia Code § 29B-1­\n4(a)(2). As discussed later in this opinion, we have crafted a two-pronged test to establish\nwhether disclosure would result in an unwarranted invasion of privacy. See Hechler v.\nCasey, 175 W.Va. 434, 333 S.E.2d 799 (1985).\n\n                                             11\n\n\f29B-1-4 has the burden of showing the express applicability of such exemption to the\n\nmaterial requested.”9 Syl. Pt. 7, Queen, 179 W.Va. at 95, 365 S.E.2d at 375.\n\n\n\n             With this background to guide us, we now address the two FOIA\n\nexemptions at issue in this appeal, 10 whether the FOIA requests are unduly burdensome\n\nto WVU, and Highland’s request for attorney fees and costs.\n\n\n\n                   A. The FOIA’s Internal Memoranda Exemption\n\n             The principal statutory provision at issue in this case, West Virginia Code §\n\n29B-1-4(a)(8) provides: “[i]nternal memoranda or letters received or prepared by any\n\npublic body” are specifically exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.           Through the\n\ndevelopment of case law, this FOIA exemption is commonly referred to as the\n\n“deliberative process” exemption and we use the terms interchangeably. The precise\n\nquestion presented here is an issue of first impression for this Court: whether a state\n\n      9\n         We promptly dispose of Highland’s assignment of error that the circuit court\nfailed to impose the burden of proof on WVU to establish the applicability of the FOIA\nexemptions it asserted. The appendix record reveals the circuit court properly held WVU\nto its burden: WVU produced multiple, detailed Vaughn indices (e.g., the index attached\nto the fourth production of documents was fifty-two pages); filed numerous briefs on the\nmerits of its claimed exemptions; participated in oral arguments; and submitted\ndocuments for the circuit court’s in camera review.\n      10\n         In Highland’s brief to this Court, it argues that WVU either waived its reliance\non the “trade secret” exemption under FOIA or failed to establish it. Because WVU does\nnot argue how the “trade secret” exemption may apply to any documents withheld in this\ncase, we agree. See generally Addair v. Bryant, 168 W.Va. 306, 316, 284 S.E.2d 374, 382\n(1981) (holding this Court may deem as waived any issue not argued in party’s appellate\nbrief).\n\n                                           12\n\n\funiversity may invoke the “internal memoranda” exemption with respect to documents\n\nrelated to its professor’s scientific/academic research. The parties do not cite any\n\nprecedent interpreting other states’ FOIAs directly on point.\n\n\n\n              We begin our analysis with our leading case on this issue, Daily Gazette I.\n\nA newspaper made FOIA requests to the West Virginia Development Office seeking\n\ninformation involving the Development Office’s deliberations about whether to support a\n\nproposed industrial plant in Mason County, West Virginia. In response, the Development\n\nOffice released certain documents but withheld others on the ground they were “internal\n\nmemoranda” exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. 198 W.V. at 567, 482 S.E.2d at\n\n566. We set forth the criteria courts must apply when addressing the FOIA’s “internal\n\nmemoranda” exemption in syllabus point four of Daily Gazette I:\n\n                     W.Va.Code, [§ 29B-1-4(a)(8)],11 which exempts from\n              disclosure “internal memoranda or letters received or\n              prepared by any public body” specifically exempts from\n              disclosure only those written internal government\n              communications consisting of advice, opinions and\n              recommendations which reflect a public body’s deliberative,\n              decision-making process; written advice, opinions and\n              recommendations from one public body to another; and\n              written advice, opinions and recommendations to a public\n              body from outside consultants or experts obtained during the\n              public body’s deliberative, decision-making process. W.Va.\n              Code, [§ 29B-1-4(a)(8)] does not exempt from disclosure\n              written communications between a public body and private\n              persons or entities where such communications do not consist\n              of advice, opinions or recommendations to the public body\n\n       11\n          The syllabus point cites West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(8) (1977), which\ncontains the same language as West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(8) (2012).\n\n                                            13\n\n\f             from outside consultants or experts obtained during the public\n             body’s deliberative, decision-making process.\n\n198 W.Va. at 575, 482 S.E.2d at 192 (footnote added).\n\n\n\n             In Daily Gazette I, we recognized the relationship between West Virginia’s\n\nFOIA “internal memoranda” exemption and the federal FOIA counterpart, which\n\nexempts from public disclosure “inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters\n\nwhich would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the\n\nagency[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5) (1994). 198 W.Va. at 571, 482 S.E.2d 188. This federal\n\nFOIA exemption “preserves to government agencies ‘such recognized evidentiary\n\nprivileges as the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and the\n\nexecutive “deliberative process” privilege.’ Schell [v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice], 843 F.2d\n\n[933] at 939 [(6th Cir. 1988)] (citing Parke, Davis & Co. v. Califano, 623 F.2d 1, 5 (6th\n\nCir. 1980)).” Daily Gazette I, 198 W.Va. at 571, 482 S.E.2d at 188. We acknowledged\n\nthe “deliberative process” privilege wording of the federal FOIA differs from that of\n\nWest Virginia’s FOIA. Id. Nevertheless, we found federal precedent useful in construing\n\nour FOIA.\n\n\n\n             In Daily Gazette I, we cited a seminal decision from the United States\n\nSupreme Court on the “deliberative process” privilege, N.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.,\n\n421 U.S. 132 (1975):\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\n\f              [t]he cases uniformly rest the [deliberative process] privilege\n              on the policy of protecting the “decision making processes of\n              government agencies,” . . . and focus on documents\n              “reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and\n              deliberations comprising part of a process by which\n              governmental decisions and policies are formulated.” . . . The\n              point, plainly made in [S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9\n              (1965)], is that the “frank discussion of legal or policy\n              matters” in writing might be inhibited if the discussion were\n              made public; and that the “decisions” and “policies\n              formulated” would be the poorer as a result.\n\n\nDaily Gazette I, 198 W.Va. at 572, 482 S.E.2d at 189 (quoting Sears Roebuck, 421 U.S.\n\nat 150).\n\n\n\n              The “deliberative process” privilege is designed to protect the quality of\n\ngovernment decision-making by ensuring that it is not done “in a fishbowl.” EPA v.\n\nMink, 410 U.S. 73, 87 (1973), superceded by statute, Freedom of Information Act, 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(1) (2002). This FOIA exemption encourages free discussion of\n\nalternatives, and “insulates against the chilling effect likely were officials to be judged\n\nnot on the basis of their final decisions, but ‘for matters they considered before making\n\nup their minds.’” City of Virginia Beach, Va. v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 995 F.2d 1247,\n\n1253 (4th Cir. 1993) (quoting Jordan v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 591 F.2d 753, 772-73 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1978), overruled in part on other grounds, Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &\n\nFirearms, 670 F.2d 1051 (D.C. Cir. 1981)). “While transparency in government is an\n\nimportant democratic value, our society has often recognized that many important\n\ngovernmental functions operate best removed from the public glare.” Michael N.\n\n                                            15\n\n\fKennedy, Escaping the Fishbowl: A Proposal to Fortify the Deliberative Process\n\nPrivilege, 99 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1769, 1770 (2005). Nevertheless, because of the FOIA’s\n\nstrong policy favoring disclosure, this exemption should be construed “as narrowly as\n\nconsistent with efficient Government operation.” Mink, 410 U.S. at 87 (quoting S. Rep.\n\nNo. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965)).12 We are mindful that the “deliberative process”\n\nFOIA exemption benefits the public and not the officials who assert it. See Kaiser\n\nAluminum and Chem. Corp. v. U.S., 157 F.Supp. 939, 944 (Ct.Cl. 1958).\n\n\n\n             To invoke the “internal memoranda” exemption successfully, the public\n\nbody must meet two prerequisites: in “the context in which the materials are used,” the\n\ndocuments must be both predecisional and deliberative. Virginia Beach, 995 F.2d at 1253\n\n(quoting Wolfe v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 839 F.2d 768, 774 (D.C.Cir.1988)).\n\nPredecisional documents are “prepared in order to assist an agency decisionmaker in\n\narriving at his decision.” Renegotiation Bd. v. Grumman Aircraft Eng’g Corp., 421 U.S.\n\n168, 184 (1975). Deliberative material “reflects the give-and-take of the consultative\n\nprocess,” by revealing the manner in which the agency evaluates possible alternative\n\npolicies or outcomes. Virginia Beach, 995 F.2d at 1253 (citing Coastal States Gas Corp.\n\nv. Dep’t of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C.Cir. 1980)).\n\n      12\n          Evidence of government misconduct, crime, and fraud bars the application of\nthe “deliberative process” exemption. See In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 738 (D.C.Cir.\n1997) (“[W]here there is reason to believe the documents sought may shed light on\ngovernment misconduct, the privilege is routinely denied, on the grounds that shielding\ninternal government deliberations in this context does not serve the public’s interest in\nhonest, effective government.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n                                           16\n\n\f               WVU argues the FOIA’s “internal memoranda” exemption justifies its\n\ndecision to withhold 760 documents. A research scientist at a public college or university\n\nis subject to FOIA because he or she is employed by a public body. Therefore, WVU\n\nmaintains he or she must be equally and congruently entitled to the protection of this\n\nFOIA exemption. For these public body employees, the public function they are hired to\n\nperform is the research and publication of scholarly articles. WVU contends the\n\n“deliberations” they undertake and the “decisions” the professors make include the final\n\npublication of their research efforts. A public university or college’s “policy” is to\n\nnurture, support, and publish academic research on areas of public concern; its mission is\n\nfulfilled when the article is published. Therefore, WVU maintains that if the deliberative\n\nprocesses of its researchers are open for public inspection, WVU will be unable to fulfill\n\nits mission.\n\n\n\n               In opposition, Highland argues this FOIA exemption does not apply\n\nbecause Professor Hendryx was not engaged in policy making on behalf of WVU when\n\npreparing the subject articles. In fact, WVU has expressly disclaimed the notion that any\n\nresearch paper published by a WVU professor represents WVU’s position or policy.13\n\nFurthermore, Highland argues the publication of the articles at issue did not involve\n\npolicy making or a deliberative process within the meaning of this FOIA exemption.\n\n\n       13\n          In 2011, WVU released the following position statement: “The findings of any\nparticular research project do not reflect, nor should they, any particular opinion or\nposition of the University itself.”\n\n                                           17\n\n\fHighland relies on a narrow reading of Ethyl Corp. v. Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n25 F.3d 1241 (4th Cir. 1994), wherein the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held the\n\n“deliberative process” exemption only allows for the withholding of documents that\n\n“bear on the formulation or exercise of policy-oriented judgment.” Id. at 1248 (emphasis\n\nadded), see also Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866 (declaring federal FOIA “deliberative\n\nprocess” privilege protects “premature disclosure of proposed policies”) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n\n\n              Ultimately, Highland maintains WVU can never avail itself of the “internal\n\nmemoranda” FOIA exemption because neither the WVU School of Medicine nor its\n\nRural Health Research Center is a state agency; they do not regulate any activity,\n\npromulgate rules or policies that govern any entity’s conduct, or engage in any other type\n\nof governmental function. Highland acknowledges, however, that Professor Hendryx may\n\nhave sought to influence the development of policy by federal and state agencies\n\nresponsible for regulating surface coal mining, but he had no authority to directly develop\n\nor impose any such policies.\n\n\n\n              We agree with Highland’s factual assessment that while WVU is a public\n\nbody, it is not a state agency engaged in policy making. We further agree that Professor\n\nHendryx did not formulate policy on behalf of WVU when he published the research\n\narticles. Nevertheless, we emphatically reject Highland’s legal argument that WVU may\n\nnot invoke the “internal memoranda” exemption because that exemption covers only\n                                            18\n\n\fdocuments reflecting agency policy making communications. There is a bulk of case law\n\napplying the federal FOIA’s “deliberative process” exemption in the context of\n\nadministrative agency policy/decision making.14 At the same time, however, a plethora of\n\nfederal FOIA cases also extend this exemption to public bodies engaged in activities\n\nother than agency policy making. “In its relatively short life, the deliberative process\n\nprivilege has become one of the most predominate privileges exercised by the\n\ngovernment and is now routinely asserted in a wide array of litigation challenging\n\ngovernment decisionmaking.” Michael Ray Harris, Standing in the Way of Judicial\n\nReview: Assertion of the Deliberative Process Privilege in APA Cases, 53 St. Louis U.\n\nL.J. 349, 350 (2009).\n\n\n\n\n      14\n         The root of this trend may be explained by the fact the federal FOIA represented\nthe culmination of years of congressional effort to amend the public information\nprovisions of the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946.\n\n                     The FOIA replaced Section 3 of the Administrative\n             Procedure Act (APA) of 1946, which ostensibly served as a\n             public information provision to permit the public to gain\n             access to federal records. However, the law was filled with\n             loopholes that the government routinely exploited to withhold\n             records. The main obstacle to public access under the APA\n             was a requirement that record requesters demonstrate that the\n             solicited information pertain directly to them. This restriction\n             prevented journalists, writers, historians, lawyers, and others\n             from gaining access to information held by the federal\n             government.\n\nMartin E. Halstuk, When Is An Invasion of Privacy Unwarranted Under the FOIA? An\nAnalysis of the Supreme Court’s “Sufficient Reason” and “Presumption of Legitimacy”\nStandards, 16 U.Fla.J.L. & Pub. Pol’y 361, 367 (2005) (footnotes omitted).\n\n                                           19\n\n\f              Having considered all of these competing arguments, we reject Highland’s\n\ncontention that the “internal memoranda” exemption applies only to administrative\n\nagency policy making. A plain reading of our FOIA confirms that WVU has the stronger\n\nargument. In West Virginia, administrative agencies are not the only public bodies\n\nsubject to the FOIA and its accompanying exemptions. West Virginia Code § 29B-1­\n\n4(a)(8) exempts from disclosure “internal memoranda or letters received or prepared by\n\nany public body.” Id. (emphasis added). And the definition of “public body” under our\n\nFOIA is extensive:\n\n                      “Public body” means every state officer, agency,\n              department, including the executive, legislative and judicial\n              departments, division, bureau, board and commission; every\n              county and city governing body, school district, special\n              district, municipal corporation, and any board, department,\n              commission, council or agency thereof; and any other body\n              which is created by state or local authority or which is\n              primarily funded by the state or local authority.\n\nId. § 29B-1-2(3).15 The public body entities and their employees set forth above engage\n\nin an immensely diverse range of endeavors related to government service. Therefore, we\n\nexpect their internal deliberations will necessarily address a variety of matters related to\n\ntheir state and/or local governmental responsibilities.\n\n       15\n         The federal FOIA uses the term “agency,” not “public body.” See Pub. Citizen\nHealth Research Grp. v. Dep’t of Health, Ed. & Welfare, 668 F.2d 537, 542 (D.C. Cir.\n1981) (“For purposes of the Freedom of Information Act the statute provides that ‘the\nterm “agency” as defined in section 551(1) . . . includes any executive department,\nmilitary department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or\nother establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive\nOffice of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.’ 5 U.S.C. § 552(e)\n(1976).”).\n\n                                             20\n\n\f             Consequently, in Daily Gazette I, we did not confine the “internal\n\nmemoranda” exemption to deliberations preceding agency policy making. Instead, we\n\nheld a public body may exempt from disclosure documents which reflect its “deliberative\n\ndecision-making process.” 198 W.Va. at 575, 482 S.E.2d at 192 (emphasis added). We\n\nexplained that courts must evaluate the “function and significance of the documents” to\n\nthe public body’s decision-making process, including an explanation of “the nature of the\n\ndecision-making authority vested in the office or person issuing the disputed\n\ndocuments[.]” Id.16\n\n\n\n             We hereby announce that West Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act,\n\nWest Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(8) (2012), exempts from disclosure “internal\n\nmemoranda or letters received or prepared by any public body” as defined by West\n\nVirginia Code § 29B-1-2(3) (2012). The FOIA reflects our Legislature’s recognition that\n\ndisclosure of public body communications reflecting deliberative processes on any\n\n\n      16\n         Similarly, other state courts have applied their respective FOIA’s “deliberative\nprocess” exemption to decisions unrelated to agency policy making. For instance,\ndocuments generated by public employees charged with hiring decisions may be exempt\nfrom disclosure when they are both predecisional and deliberative. See Wilson v. Super.\nCt., 51 Cal. App. 4th 1136, 1143 (Calif. Ct. of App. 2nd Dist. 1997) (applying California\nstate’s FOIA, documents held exempt when their sole purpose was to aid Governor in\nselecting gubernatorial appointees, process which depends upon confidential, candid\ndiscussion of candidates’ professional competence, political views and private conduct).\nOther state courts have also applied this FOIA exemption to documents reflecting\ndecision-making activities of judicial branch employees unrelated to agency policy\nmaking. See Commonwealth v. Vartan, 733 A.2d 1258, 1266 (Pa. 1999) (holding\n“deliberative process” privilege protected deliberations by members of Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court regarding decision to build new courthouse).\n\n                                           21\n\n\fsubject could have a chilling effect on future communications. Confidentiality of certain\n\ndocuments connected with a public body’s decision-making process ensures frank and\n\nopen discussion among its employees, which in turn enhances the quality of their\n\ndecisions. Considering the strong policy favoring disclosure of public documents, courts\n\nmust construe this exemption narrowly as consistent with efficient state and local\n\ngovernment operations. The key question in every case is whether the disclosure of\n\ndocuments would expose a public body’s decision-making process so as to discourage\n\ncandid discussion and thereby undermine the public body’s ability to perform its\n\nfunctions. See Times Mirror Co. v. Super. Ct., 813 P.2d 240, 250 (Cal. 1991) (“In short,\n\nthe courts’ focus . . . is less on the nature of the records sought and more on the effect of\n\nthe records’ release.”).\n\n\n\n              Having determined that WVU, as a public body, may assert the “internal\n\nmemoranda” exemption, we now turn to the pivotal question of whether the withheld\n\ndocuments fall within this exemption. As discussed above, to invoke the “internal\n\nmemoranda” exemption set forth in West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(8) (2012)\n\nsuccessfully, the public body must show that in the context in which the materials are\n\nprepared or considered, the documents are both predecisional and deliberative to its\n\ndecision-making process. Predecisional documents are prepared in order to assist a public\n\nbody decisionmaker in arriving at his or her decision. Deliberative material reflects the\n\ngive-and-take of the consultative process, by revealing the manner in which the public\n\nbody evaluates possible alternatives relevant to the decisional process.\n                                            22\n\n\f              The relevant public body decision for purposes of applying the\n\n“deliberative process” exemption to these public records is not whether WVU adopted a\n\nposition or policy regarding mountaintop coal removal’s health effects on state residents.\n\nRather, when a FOIA requester seeks records surrounding or leading up to an agency\n\npublication, the relevant agency decision for purposes of applying the “deliberative\n\nprocess” exemption is the development and ultimate publication of the article. See United\n\nAm. Fin., Inc. v. Potter, 531 F.Supp.2d 29, 44 (D.D.C. 2008) (finding that relevant\n\nagency decision was agency’s publication of article where plaintiff’s FOIA request\n\nsought all supporting documents and drafts of documents relating to article), accord,\n\nHooker v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 887 F.Supp.2d 40, 57 (D.D.C. 2012).\n\n\n\n              In Hooker, a parent of an autistic child filed a federal FOIA action against\n\nthe Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the Centers for Disease\n\nControl (“CDC”), seeking disclosure of information, including all correspondence among\n\nresearchers, regarding the publication of studies relating to a possible connection between\n\na mercury-based compound used in vaccines and autism. Id. at 45. Like Highland sought\n\nin the instant case, Mr. Hooker wanted access to this information to refute the\n\nconclusions reached in the articles. Mr. Hooker contended the HHS and CDC\n\nconsistently denied a relationship between the mercury-based compound and autism, “in\n\nthe face of ‘a mounting body of compelling scientific literature’ that support[ed] the\n\nexistence of such a relationship.” Id. The court rejected Mr. Hooker’s arguments and\n\nfound the HHS and CDC properly applied the federal FOIA “deliberative process”\n                                    23\n\n\fexemption to material that was deliberative in nature when withholding internal\n\ncommunications revealing the analysis underlying the draft manuscripts. Id. at 58.\n\n\n\n              We find the court’s analysis in Hooker instructive. Thus, we limit our\n\ninquiry to whether a requested document, regardless of its nature, (1) was generated\n\nbefore the publication of the research article to which it relates, and if so, (2) whether it\n\nreflects Professor Hendryx’s deliberative, decision-making or thought process employed\n\nto arrive at the article’s conclusions and ultimate publication. “[T]he deliberative process\n\nexemption protects ‘recommendations, draft documents, proposals, suggestions, and\n\nother subjective documents which reflect the personal opinions of the writer rather than\n\nthe policy of the agency.’” Virginia Beach, 995 F.2d at 1253 (quoting Coastal States, 617\n\nF.2d at 866). “Draft documents, by their very nature, are typically predecisional and\n\ndeliberative.” Keeper of the Mountains Found. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 514 F.Supp. 2d\n\n837, 854 (S.D. W.Va. 2007) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n              In Chemical Manufacturers Association v. Consumer Product Safety\n\nCommission, 600 F.Supp. 114 (D.D.C. 1984), the district court addressed this same issue\n\nand found documents qualified under the federal FOIA “deliberative process” exemption\n\nbecause they detailed an exchange of ideas among scientists regarding the agency’s study\n\nof a chemical used in the manufacture of toys. Id. at 119. The court ruled these scientific\n\ndeliberations were part of the agency’s “give-and-take” and that disclosure of such\n\ndeliberations would discourage open discussion among the agency scientists. Id.\n                                             24\n\n\fSpecifically, the court held that “scientists should be able to withhold nascent thoughts\n\nwhere disclosure would discourage the intellectual risk-taking so essential to technical\n\nprogress.” 600 F.Supp. at 118.\n\n\n\n              Not only is the parallel to the concerns raised in Hooker and Chemical\n\nManufacturers evident, but Highland’s attempt to invade Professor Hendryx’s\n\ndeliberative process is patent. First, considering the context in which the materials were\n\nused, WVU has shown that any document which reveals the analysis underlying\n\nProfessor Hendryx’s articles is predecisional. In the state higher education academic\n\nsetting, documents generated before the final publication of a scientific research article –\n\nall documents related to the initiation, preparation and publication of the articles – are by\n\ntheir very nature predecisional. Second, WVU has shown that any document, regardless\n\nof its nature, that exposes the give-and-take of the scientific research consultative\n\nprocess, by revealing the manner in which the researchers evaluate possible alternative\n\noutcomes, is deliberative. Because these drafts, data compilations 17 and analyses,\n\n\n       17\n          Nearly all Professor Hendryx’s articles that were the subject of Highland’s\nFOIA requests were based on studies using secondary data only. However, the Self-\nReported Cancer Rates Study did involve the use of personal surveys of residents living\nin areas where mountaintop coal removal took place. We find WVU may withhold\ndocuments generated in data compilation because these documents could reveal the\ndeliberative process. See Hooker, 887 F.Supp.2d at 58 (“‘The choice of what factual\nmaterial . . . to include or remove during the drafting process is itself often part of the\ndeliberative process, and thus is properly exempt under [the federal FOIA “deliberative\nprocess” exemption].’” (quoting ViroPharma, Inc. v. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs.,\n839 F.Supp.2d 184 193 (D.D.C. 2012)); Montrose Chem. Corp. of Cal. v. Train, 491 F.2d\n63, 67-70 (1974) (holding “deliberative process” privilege applied to summaries\n(continued . . .)\n                                            25\n\n\fproposed edits, e-mails and other communications, and peer review comments and\n\nresponses relate to the planning, preparation and editing necessary to produce a final\n\npublished article, they are exempt from disclosure. We therefore find that, on the\n\nevidence before the circuit court at the summary judgment hearing,18 WVU successfully\n\ncarried its burden of proving certain documents fell under the “internal memoranda”\n\numbrella of the FOIA.\n\n\n\n             Our review of the appendix record, however, reveals that WVU improperly\n\nclaimed the “deliberative process” exemption to some documents that are post-decisional\n\nand/or non-deliberative.19 As the Supreme Court recognized in Sears, the purpose of the\n\n\ncontaining only factual material because documents revealed author’s evaluative\njudgment as to relative significance of facts and what facts he considered to be important\nor unimportant); Washington Research Project, Inc. v.

U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 639 F.Supp. 1368, 1373 (E.D.N.C. 1986) (“Because\nthe list sought here is composed of selective fact, it . . . could reveal the deliberative\nprocess.”).\n      18\n          This Court reviewed the same evidence. The parties submitted a Joint Appendix\nthat contained five DVDs of the documents provided by WVU in response to Highland’s\nFOIA requests. WVU also submitted to this Court, under seal, the documents it submitted\nto the circuit court for in camera review.\n      19\n         For instance, Document No. 03-0217 in the sample Vaughn index consists of an\ne-mail dated July 28, 2011, regarding a potential speaking engagement pertaining to the\nvarious articles at issue. We find WVU’s argument unconvincing that this e-mail should\nbe protected from disclosure because it “reflect[s] these individuals’ thought processes\nand analyses that ultimately resulted in the final decision on how such matters concerning\npublicity should be handled on behalf of [WVU.]” To accept WVU’s argument here, we\nwould be allowing the exception to swallow the rule.\n\n                                           26\n\n\fdeliberative process privilege is to protect the quality of an agency’s decision; revealing\n\n“communications made after the decision and designed to explain it” do not affect a\n\ndecision’s quality. 421 U.S. at 152.\n\n\n\n                Our holding today comports with American Tradition Institute v. Rector\n\nand Visitors of the University of Virginia, 756 S.E.2d 435 (Va. 2014) (“UVA”), where\n\nthe Virginia Supreme Court was faced with facts analogous to the instant case. In UVA, a\n\nrequester brought suit under Virginia’s FOIA against the University of Virginia seeking\n\ndisclosure of documents produced or received by a former professor while working at the\n\nuniversity. Id. at 437. The professor was a climate scientist and former professor whose\n\nscholarly work had “generated much scientific and political interest.” Id. Applying a\n\nFOIA exemption,20 the court upheld the university’s exclusion of the documents from\n\nproduction. Id. at 442. In UVA, “many noted scholars and academic administrators\n\nsubmitted affidavits attesting to the harmful impact disclosure would have in these\n\ncircumstances.” Id. The court quoted an affidavit from John Simon, Vice President and\n\n\n       20\n            Virginia Code § 2.2-3705.4(4) (West 2014) provides:\n\n                        Data, records or information of a proprietary nature\n                produced or collected by or for faculty or staff of public\n                institutions of higher education, other than the institutions’\n                financial or administrative records, in the conduct of or as a\n                result of study or research on medical, scientific, technical or\n                scholarly issues, whether sponsored by the institution alone or\n                in conjunction with a governmental body or a private\n                concern, where such data, records or information has not been\n                publicly released, published, copyrighted or patented.\n\n                                              27\n\n\fProvost of the university and former Vice-Provost of Duke University, addressing the\n\nconcerns relevant to academia:\n\n                      If U.S. scientists at public institutions lose the ability\n              to protect their communications with faculty at other\n              institutions, their ability to collaborate will be gravely\n              harmed. The result will be a loss of scientific and creative\n              opportunities for faculty at institutions in states which have\n              not established protections under state FOIAs for such\n              communications. . . . For faculty at public institutions such as\n              the University of Virginia, compelled disclosure of their\n              unpublished thoughts, data, and personal scholarly\n              communications would mean a fundamental disruption of the\n              norms and expectations which have enabled research to\n              flourish at the great public institutions for over a century.\n                      ...\n                      I can state unequivocally that recruitment of faculty to\n              an institution like the University of Virginia will be deeply\n              harmed if such faculty must fear that their unpublished\n              communications with the scientific collaborators and\n              scholarly colleagues are subject to involuntary public\n              disclosure.\n\nId. at 442.\n\n\n\n              The same reasoning applies with equal force here.21 When we focus on the\n\nresulting effect of the documents’ release, the resolution of this case is decidedly clear.\n\n\n       21\n          The UVA case best illuminates the public policy facet of the issue before us. If\nWest Virginia State colleges and universities cannot retain their researchers and scientists\nbecause the FOIA exposes them to an unfair intrusion into the scientific process, then the\nproblem of operating in a “fishbowl” pales in comparison to the challenge of attracting\nand retaining highly qualified faculty. See generally Dianna G. Goldenson, FOIA\nExemption Five: Will it Protect Government Scientists From Unfair Intrusion?, 29 B.C.\nEnvtl. Aff. L. Rev. 311 (2002) (arguing federal FOIA “deliberative process” exemption\nshould be recognized by courts as mode of protecting government scientists from unfair\nintrusion into scientific research).\n\n                                             28\n\n\fThe involuntary public disclosure of Professor Hendryx’s research documents would\n\nexpose the decision-making process in such a way as to hinder candid discussion of\n\nWVU’s faculty and undermine WVU’s ability to perform its operations. We\n\nacknowledge that West Virginia’s FOIA does not have an exemption specifically\n\napplicable to state institutions of higher education like Virginia does. Nevertheless, we\n\nfind that documents generated during higher education academic research may be legally\n\nprotected from disclosure under West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(8), when the public\n\nbody demonstrates the criteria outlined above are satisfied. Accordingly, we affirm the\n\norder of the circuit court insofar as it found WVU properly invoked the FOIA “internal\n\nmemoranda” exemption to withhold certain documents.\n\n\n\n                     B. The FOIA’s Personal Privacy Exemption\n\n             The FOIA’s “personal privacy” exemption permits the withholding of\n\n“information of a personal nature such as that kept in a personal, medical or similar\n\nfile[.]” W.Va. Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2). In syllabus point six of Hechler v. Casey, 175\n\nW.Va. 434, 333 S.E.2d 799 (1985), we held: “The primary purpose of the invasion of\n\nprivacy exemption to the Freedom of Information Act, W.Va.Code, [§ 29B-1-4(a)(2)],22 is\n\nto protect individuals from the injury and embarrassment that can result from the\n\nunnecessary disclosure of personal information.” Id. (footnote added). We employ a two-\n\npronged inquiry in deciding whether the public body has correctly withheld records under\n\n      22\n          The syllabus point cites West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(2) (1977), which\ncontains the same language as West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2) (2012).\n\n                                           29\n\n\fthis exemption. First, we determine whether the records in question are “personal,”\n\n“medical,” or “similar” files. Second, if so, we then balance or weigh the individual’s\n\nright of privacy against “the public’s right to know.” Hechler, 175 W.Va. at 444, 333\n\nS.E.2d at 810.\n\n\n\n              Our analysis is consistent with case law interpreting the federal FOIA\n\ncounterpart. The federal FOIA exemption provides that government can withhold\n\n“personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a\n\nclearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) (2009). See\n\nMartin E. Halstuk, When Is An Invasion of Privacy Unwarranted Under the FOIA? An\n\nAnalysis of the Supreme Court’s “Sufficient Reason” and “Presumption of Legitimacy”\n\nStandards, 16 U.Fla.J.L. & Pub. Pol’y 361, 371 (2005) (“When an agency makes a\n\ndetermination in a privacy-interests case[,] . . . it first must decide whether the requested\n\nrecords fall within the definition of ‘personnel,’ ‘medical,’ or ‘similar’ files. Second, the\n\nagency must balance the invasion of the individual’s personal privacy against the public’s\n\ninterest in disclosure to determine whether the disclosure is justified.”) (footnotes\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n              Here, the circuit court concluded WVU properly withheld 740 documents\n\non the basis of “academic freedom,” a concept which it incorporated into the FOIA’s\n\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\n\f                                 23\n“personal privacy” exemption.         The circuit court conceded that its ruling was\n\nunprecedented. The circuit court’s holding rested upon three distinct considerations: (1)\n\nthe First Amendment encompasses an “academic freedom” privilege that is\n\n“transcendental, applicable to both constitutional law and to FOIA”; (2) the guarantee set\n\nforth in the West Virginia Constitution that provides all citizens have a right to a\n\nthorough and efficient educational system; and (3) the determination that individual peer\n\nreviewers have an expectation of privacy that will be harmed by the release of their\n\ncomments, even though such comments are submitted anonymously.\n\n\n\n             We summarily reject the first two considerations outlined above. First, the\n\nWest Virginia Freedom of Information Act does not provide an “academic freedom”\n\nexemption to its general disclosure provision, West Virginia Code § 29B-1-3 (2012).\n\nAlthough the First Amendment has been held to apply to protect colleges and universities\n\nagainst undue interference by the government,24 First Amendment jurisprudence does not\n\n\n      23\n        The circuit court noted, however, that the “deliberative process” exemption\nwould shield the same documents from disclosure.\n      24\n          The primary case cited by WVU on this issue, Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354\nU.S. 234 (1957), is not relevant to the instant case. Sweezy was decided on the basis of a\ndenial of due process, in the form of an open-ended, unlimited investigation of the\npersonal conduct and affairs of a faculty member. The Supreme Court in Sweezy dealt\nwith a challenge to the use of a New Hampshire statute to hold a university professor in\ncontempt for failing to answer questions posed to him (by the New Hampshire Attorney\nGeneral, on behalf of the Legislature) concerning his belief in Communism and\ninvolvement with the Progressive Party. Id. at 242-244. This case did not involve the\nfederal FOIA or any similar statute, nor did it involve the professor’s research\nactivities/scientific publications.\n\n                                            31\n\n\fsupport its application in the context of this case. Because the exemptions to the Act are\n\nrequired to be strictly construed, this Court declines to create an “academic freedom”\n\nexemption not specifically set forth in the FOIA. See Syl. Pt. 5, Queen, 179 W.Va. 95,\n\n365 S.E.2d 375. In Banker v. Banker, 196 W.Va. 535, 474 S.E.2d 465 (1996) we stated,\n\n“[i]t is not for this Court arbitrarily to read into [a statute] that which it does not say. Just\n\nas courts are not to eliminate through judicial interpretation words that were purposely\n\nincluded, we are obliged not to add to statutes something the Legislature purposely\n\nomitted.” Id. at 546-47, 474 S.E.2d at 476-77. This Court has further cautioned that “[a]\n\nstatute, or an administrative rule, may not, under the guise of ‘interpretation,’ be\n\nmodified, revised, amended or rewritten.” Syl. Pt. 1, Consumer Advocate Div. v. Pub.\n\nServ. Comm’n, 182 W.Va. 152, 386 S.E.2d 650 (1989). Therefore, we find the broad\n\nprinciple of “academic freedom” would not justify WVU’s wholesale avoidance of the\n\nplain language of the FOIA. 25\n\n\n\n              Second, the guarantee of a “thorough and efficient system of free schools”\n\nunder the West Virginia Constitution does not extend to institutions of higher education\n\nsuch as WVU. See W.Va. Const. art. XII, § 1; Syl. Pt. 7, Randolph Co. Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nAdams, 196 W.Va. 9, 467 S.E.2d 150 (1995) (“Whatever items are deemed necessary to\n\n\n       25\n         Likewise, WVU wrongly suggests we should recognize an “academic freedom”\nexemption from FOIA to mirror “the justification for First Amendment protections\nafforded to journalists.” The principles that support the extension of First Amendment\nprotections to journalists and their confidential sources have no application to the matter\nbefore us.\n\n                                               32\n\n\faccomplish the goals of a school system and are in fact an integral fundamental part of\n\nthe elementary and secondary education must be provided free of charge to all students in\n\norder to comply with the constitutional mandate of a free school system pursuant to\n\nSection 1 of Article XII of the West Virginia Constitution.”). Our Constitution does not\n\nestablish a right to a higher education; the circuit court’s reliance on this principle was\n\nentirely misplaced.\n\n\n\n              We now turn to the third consideration set forth above. The pertinent issue\n\nhere is whether Highland’s request for “[a]ll comments by peer reviewers concerning\n\ndrafts of the documents” constitute “information of a personal nature” within the meaning\n\nof the privacy exemption at West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2). WVU asserts the peer\n\nreviewers’ privacy expectations would be violated by the release of their anonymous,\n\nconfidential comments. The identity of peer reviewers is traditionally kept confidential in\n\norder to facilitate a candid exchange regarding a proposed article and its research. WVU\n\nmaintains that to subject a reviewer’s comments to public scrutiny, even while keeping\n\nthe identity of the reviewer withheld, would render a reviewer more reluctant to challenge\n\ntraditional ideas and propose unconventional concepts.\n\n\n\n              Highland responds that WVU’s argument “stands the notion of ‘personal’\n\ninformation on its ear.” Applying the plain meaning of the word “personal,” Highland\n\nargues this exemption cannot apply to peer review comments, submitted anonymously to\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\n\fan academic or scientific journal, that are not kept in a “personal, medical, or similar file”\n\npertaining to the person who prepared them. We agree.\n\n\n\n              This Court finds that WVU fails to meet the first prong of Hechler because\n\nthe records in question are not “personal, medical or similar file[s]” that fall under the\n\nFOIA’s “personal privacy” exemption. W.Va. Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2). In fact, these\n\nanonymous peer review comments contain no personal identifying information at all.\n\nTherefore, the only case relied upon by WVU on this issue is distinguishable from the\n\ninstant case. In Cook v. National Archives & Records Administration, 758 F.3d 168 (2nd\n\nCir. 2014), the court held records pertaining to research requests made on behalf of\n\nformer President and former Vice President for records from their own administration\n\nwere “similar files” to “personnel” files exempt under the federal FOIA “personal\n\nprivacy” exemption, because “they contain[ed] detailed records containing personal\n\ninformation identifiable to the former officials and their representatives.” Id. at 175.\n\n\n\n              Because WVU fails to meet the first prong of Hechler, our analysis stops\n\nhere; we need not proceed to address the second prong to balance or weigh the\n\nindividual’s right of privacy against “the public’s right to know.” 175 W.Va. at 444, 333\n\nS.E.2d at 810. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the circuit court insofar as it found\n\nthat WVU properly withheld documents on the basis of “academic freedom,” as it\n\nincorporated into the FOIA’s “personal privacy” exemption set forth in West Virginia\n\nCode § 29B-1-4(a)(2).\n                                             34\n\n\f              We do, however, agree with the circuit court’s finding that the same\n\ndocuments would fall under the FOIA “internal memoranda” exemption. As previously\n\ndiscussed, disclosure of the anonymous peer review comments submitted to Professor\n\nHendryx, as he was drafting the articles, would undercut the decision-making process\n\nembodied by the FOIA’s exemption and discourage open discussion necessary for\n\nscientific/academic research. See Daily Gazette I, 198 W. Va. at 572, 482 S.E.2d at 189\n\n(stating that “in the spirit of further promoting frank and open discussions during an\n\nagency’s deliberative process, courts have interpreted the deliberative process privilege to\n\ninclude opinions and recommendations to a governmental agency by outside consultants\n\nand experts so long as such opinions or recommendations are obtained during the\n\ngovernment agency’s deliberative, predecisional process”).\n\n\n\n                          C. Reasonableness of FOIA Request\n\n              WVU initially moved to dismiss this action claiming the FOIA requests\n\nwere unduly burdensome. The circuit court denied this motion and WVU engaged in\n\ndocument review and production. WVU produced 2,364 documents, totaling 11,090\n\npages and redacted 119 of those documents; WVU withheld 772 documents and claimed\n\nthe FOIA exemptions discussed above. By the time the circuit court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of WVU, the university claimed to have reviewed over 40,000\n\ndocuments and identified over 200,000 potentially responsive documents.\n\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\n\f              In its March 19, 2014, order, the circuit court found “at this point,” WVU\n\nhad demonstrated that the FOIA requests were unduly burdensome, and noted it was\n\nconcerned about the time and expense that “would be required to complete the process[.]”\n\nWVU maintains the circuit court correctly found that the past two years of litigation and\n\ndocument production proved Highland’s FOIA requests were unduly burdensome. WVU\n\nargues that while the FOIA is designed to foster public transparency and accountability,\n\nthe Act also reflects the Legislature’s “concern that information requests not become\n\nmechanisms to paralyze other necessary government functions.” Farley, 215 W.Va. at\n\n422 n.14, 599 S.E.2d at 845 n.14.\n\n\n\n              Highland counters that the circuit court inexplicably failed to address its\n\nvoluntary offer to limit or potentially eliminate the need for further document processing.\n\nIn response to a letter from WVU’s counsel pointing out the anticipated cost to process\n\nthat information, Highland’s counsel agreed that WVU could defer processing of those\n\ndocuments pending further rulings. In addition, Highland noted that if the documents that\n\nhave been withheld thus far were provided, Highland may decide that it does not wish to\n\nreceive any of the remaining documents. In accordance with this discussion, in its Cross-\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment, Highland only requested the release of previously-\n\nwithheld documents as listed in the Vaughn indices, and that WVU be required to confer\n\nwith Highland as to any additional documents.\n\n\n\n\n                                            36\n\n\f              To be sure, the FOIA requires a public body to conduct a reasonable search\n\nfor responsive records. Further,\n\n                     [i]n response to a proper Freedom of Information Act\n              request, a public body has a duty to redact or segregate\n              exempt from non-exempt information contained within the\n              public record(s) responsive to the FOIA request and to\n              disclose the nonexempt information unless such segregation\n              or redaction would impose upon the public body an\n              unreasonably high burden or expense. If the public body\n              refuses to provide redacted or segregated copies because the\n              process of redacting or segregating would impose an\n              unreasonably high burden or expense, the public body must\n              provide the requesting party a written response that is\n              sufficiently detailed to justify refusal to honor the FOIA\n              request on these grounds. Such written response, however,\n              need not be so detailed that the justification would\n              compromise the secret nature of the exempt information.\n\nSyl. Pt. 5, Farley, 215 W.Va. at 412, 599 S.E.2d at 835.\n\n\n\n              However, the FOIA does not require a public body to conduct what\n\namounts to an unreasonably burdensome search in response to a request. See Am. Fed’n\n\nof Gov’t Emps. v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 907 F.2d 203, 208-09 (D.C. Cir. 1990)\n\n(finding unreasonably burdensome FOIA request to locate “every chronological office\n\nfile and correspondent file, internal and external, for every branch office, staff office\n\n[etc.]”); Assassination Archives & Research Ctr. v. C.I.A., 720 F.Supp. 217, 219 (D.D.C.\n\n1989) (recognizing public record laws are not designed to “reduce government agencies\n\nto full-time investigators on behalf of requesters.”), but see Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Dep’t of\n\nEduc., 292 F.Supp.2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2003) (rejecting claim of undue burden when\n\ndefendants “merely claim that [manually] searching . . . 25,000 paper files would be\n                                        37\n\n\f‘costly and take many hours to complete,’ . . . [w]ithout more specification as to why a\n\nsearch certain to turn up responsive documents would be unduly burdensome”).\n\n\n\n              When examining the burden on a public body to comply with a FOIA\n\nrequest, we note our FOIA provides “[t]he public body may establish fees reasonably\n\ncalculated to reimburse it for its actual cost in making reproductions of such records.”\n\nW.Va. Code § 29B-1-3(5). This Court recently held in syllabus point two of King v.\n\nNease, 233 W.Va. 252, 757 S.E.2d 782 (2014): “Pursuant to West Virginia Code § 29B­\n\n1-3(5) (2012), a public body is vested with the authority and discretion to impose a search\n\nor retrieval fee in connection with a Freedom of Information Act request to provide\n\npublic records provided that such fee is reasonable.”26\n\n\n\n              Based on Highland’s proposal to limit the need for WVU to continue\n\nfurther document processing, we find the circuit court erred in finding the FOIA requests\n\nwere unreasonably burdensome and dismissing the action at this stage of the litigation.\n\nThe “FOIA requester is the ‘master’ of the FOIA request” and “FOIA requests are\n\nfrequently clarified or modified even after a lawsuit is filed.” People for Am. Way Found.\n\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 451 F.Supp.2d 6, 12 (D.C.D.C. 2006).\n\n\n       26\n          Our Legislature recently amended this portion of the FOIA. See House Bill\n2636, 2015 Leg. 82nd Sess. (W.Va. 2015) (effective June 12, 2015) (authorizing public\nbody to establish fees reasonably calculated to reimburse actual costs in making\nreproductions of records; public body may not charge search or retrieval fee as part of\ncosts associated with making reproduction of records).\n\n                                            38\n\n\f             Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court’s order insofar as it dismissed this\n\naction and remand the case for further proceedings. We find Highland should have the\n\nopportunity to taper its FOIA requests correspondent to our holdings in this case.\n\nThereafter, the circuit court should revisit its decision of whether Highland’s FOIA\n\nrequests are unduly burdensome. Applying this Court’s ruling, the circuit court will find\n\nthat WVU’s document production obligations are dramatically reduced. If the circuit\n\ncourt does not dismiss this action, it should consider appointing a special commissioner\n\npursuant to Rule 53 of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure to review any\n\ndocuments withheld by WVU, in camera, to determine whether they are exempt from\n\ndisclosure under the FOIA. Further, the parties are expected to confer regarding the fees\n\nHighland may incur with respect to any further document processing and production by\n\nWVU.\n\n\n\n                 D. Highland’s Request for Attorney Fees and Costs\n\n             The FOIA provides that any person who is a successful FOIA litigant must\n\nbe awarded attorney fees and costs. Specifically, West Virginia Code § 29B-1-7 provides:\n\n             [a]ny person who is denied access to public records requested\n             pursuant to this article and who successfully brings a suit\n             filed pursuant to section five of this article shall be entitled to\n             recover his or her attorney fees and court costs from the\n             public body that denied him or her access to the records.\n\nIn syllabus point seven of Daily Gazette Co. v. West Virginia Development Office, 206\n\nW.Va. 51, 521 S.E.2d 543 (1999) (hereinafter “Daily Gazette II”), we held:\n\n\n                                             39\n\n\f                     For a person to have brought a suit for the disclosure\n              of public records under the West Virginia Freedom of\n              Information Act (FOIA), as permitted by W.Va. Code § 29B­\n              1-5 (1977) (Repl.Vol.1998), so as to entitle him/her to an\n              award of attorney’s fees for “successfully” bringing such suit\n              pursuant to W.Va. Code § 29B-1-7 (1992) (Repl.Vol.1998),\n              he/she need not have prevailed on every argument he/she\n              advanced during the FOIA proceedings or have received the\n              full and complete disclosure of every public record he/she\n              wished to inspect or examine. An award of attorney’s fees is\n              proper even when some of the requested records are ordered\n              to be disclosed while others are found to be exempt from\n              disclosure or are released in redacted form. In the final\n              analysis, a successful FOIA action, such as would warrant an\n              award of attorney’s fees as authorized by W.Va. Code § 29B­\n              1-7, is one which has contributed to the defendant’s\n              disclosure, whether voluntary or by order of court, of the\n              public records originally denied the plaintiff.\n\n\n              Highland contends the circuit court erred in neglecting to address its\n\nrequest for attorney fees and costs. While WVU disagrees, Highland argues it\n\nsuccessfully brought this FOIA suit because WVU originally denied it access to any\n\npublic records, and, WVU was forced to produce more than 2,200 documents in\n\ncompliance with the circuit court’s November 7, 2012 order. WVU argues that the\n\ncircuit court’s final ruling that Highland’s FOIA requests were unduly burdensome\n\neliminates its claim for attorney fees and costs.\n\n\n\n              “Typically, we have steadfastly held to the rule that we will not address a\n\nnonjurisdictional issue that has not been determined by the lower court.” State ex rel.\n\nClark v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of W.Va., Inc., 203 W.Va. 690, 699, 510 S.E.2d 764, 773\n\n(1998), accord Syl. Pt. 3, Voelker v. Frederick Bus. Props. Co., 195 W.Va. 246, 465\n                                          40\n\n\fS.E.2d 246 (1995). Accordingly, we remand this case for further proceedings to take up\n\nHighland’s request for attorney fees and costs in accordance with the guidelines set forth\n\nin Daily Gazette II. The circuit court must determine if Highland instituted “a successful\n\nFOIA action,” that would warrant such an award as authorized by West Virginia Code §\n\n29B-1-7, and enter an order addressing this request.\n\n\n\n                                  IV. CONCLUSION\n\n             For the reasons set forth above, the March 19, 2014, order of the Circuit\n\nCourt of Monongalia County is affirmed, in part; reversed, in part; and this action is\n\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                       Affirmed, in part; reversed, in part; and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                           41\n\n\f",

The FOIA requests focused on\n\ndocuments related to several articles co-authored by WVU Associate Professor Michael\n\nHendryx, Ph.D., suggesting that environmental impacts of surface coal mining play a role\n\nin the health problems of the area’s residents. The parties litigated this matter for two\n\nyears in the Circuit Court of Monongalia County; WVU released certain documents to\n\nHighland but withheld certain other documents, either in whole or in part, claiming they\n\nwere statutorily exempt. Finally, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nWVU, and dismissed this action.\n\n\n\n             On appeal to this Court, Highland raises several assignments of error and\n\nargues the circuit court’s order should be reversed because it is based upon an\n\nunprecedented expansion of the FOIA exemptions. Upon review, we affirm, in part;\n\nreverse, in part; and remand the case for further proceedings. For the reasons discussed\n\nbelow, this Court finds: (1) WVU may invoke the FOIA’s “internal memoranda”\n\nexemption set forth in West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(8) to withhold documents that\n\nreflect Professor Hendryx’s deliberative process; (2) WVU may not claim an “academic\n\nfreedom” privilege to avoid the plain language of the FOIA; (3) the FOIA’s “personal\n\n                                           1\n\n\fprivacy” exemption set forth in West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2) is not applicable to\n\ndocuments containing anonymous peer review comments of the draft articles but those\n\ndocuments are still exempt from disclosure under the FOIA’s “internal memoranda”\n\nexemption; (4) Highland should have been afforded the opportunity to modify its FOIA\n\nrequests before the circuit court dismissed the action; and (5) the circuit court must issue\n\na ruling on Highland’s request for attorney fees and costs. Accordingly, we remand this\n\nmatter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                      I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n                Highland submitted extensive FOIA requests to WVU on February 1, 2012.\n\nHighland requested documents related to eight articles co-authored by Professor\n\nHendryx, Director of the West Virginia Rural Health Research Center, with WVU’s\n\nSchool of Medicine’s Department of Community Medicine. In those articles, Professor\n\nHendryx suggested there was a connection between surface coal mining and birth defects,\n\ncancer, and poor quality of life in the region. 1 Highland requested essentially all\n\n\n       1\n           One of these articles sets forth the following conclusions:\n\n                      Results indicate that previously documented HRQOL\n               [Health Related Quality of Life] disparities in Appalachia’s\n               coal mining areas are concentrated in MTM [Mountaintop\n               Mining] zones in the central part of the region. These\n               disparities partly reflect the chronic socioeconomic\n               weaknesses inherent in coal-dependent economies and\n               highlight the need for efforts at economic diversification in\n               these areas. However, significant disparities persist after\n               control for these risks and suggest that the environmental\n(continued . . .)\n                                             2\n\n\fdocuments related to the initiation, preparation and publication of Professor Hendryx’s\n\narticles. 2\n\n\n\n\n              impacts of MTM may also play a role in the health problems\n              of the area’s population. In April 2010, the EPA\n              [Environmental Protection Agency] issued new guidance\n              regulating MTM that recognized the environmental and\n              community health costs imposed by this practice: the\n              guidance was intended to make new MTM permits much\n              more difficult to obtain. Several weeks after this ruling, the\n              first MTM permit application to come before the EPA was\n              nevertheless approved, leading to concerns from\n              environmental communities that the rules would not be\n              interpreted or enforced as intended. Our results contribute to\n              the evidence base in support of the April EPA decision.\n\nZullig, K.J. and Hendryx, M., et al., Health-Related Quality of Life Among Central\nAppalachian Residents in Mountaintop Mining Counties, 101, No. 5 Am. J. Pub. Health\n848, 852 (May 2011) (footnotes omitted).\n        2\n         Highland submitted two FOIA requests on the same day. In one FOIA request\n(referred to by the parties as the “subpoena-based FOIA request”), Highland requested\nthe release of the same information that had been the subject of three subpoenas\npreviously served on WVU by Highland in December of 2011. Articles co-authored by\nProfessor Hendryx were used to challenge Highland’s proposal to expand its Reylas\nsurface coal mine in Logan County, West Virginia, in a civil action filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. Ohio Valley Environ.\nCoal., Inc., et al. v. U.S. Army Corps. of Eng’s, Civil Action No. 3:11-cv-0149 (S.D.\nW.Va. 2011). The plaintiffs in that litigation sought to add a new claim to their complaint\nbased upon adverse health effects associated with surface coal mining. Highland served\nthree subpoenas on non-party WVU seeking information regarding the three articles cited\nby the plaintiffs in that lawsuit. After the district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to\nadd health-based claims to their complaint, Highland withdrew the subpoena request in\nJanuary of 2012. However, Highland advised WVU that it would file a FOIA request\nseeking the same information.\n        In the subpoena-based FOIA request, Highland requested all documents related to\nthe initiation, preparation and publication of those articles; it requested the curriculum\nvitae of the study authors, the data used in the statistical analysis presented in the subject\n(continued . . .)\n                                              3\n\n\f             By e-mails dated March 2, 2012, WVU refused to release any documents\n\nresponsive to the FOIA requests. WVU asserted the documents were exempt from\n\ndisclosure under the following FOIA exemptions: (1) information of a personal nature,\n\nWest Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2); (2) information specifically exempt from disclosure\n\nby statute, West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(5); (3) internal memoranda, West Virginia\n\nCode § 29B-1-4(a)(8); and (4) trade secrets, West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(1).\n\n\n\n             On April 12, 2012, Highland instituted this action against WVU, seeking\n\ndisclosure of the documents it requested pursuant to the FOIA. WVU filed a motion to\n\ndismiss on August 3, 2012, claiming the FOIA requests were overly broad and unduly\n\nburdensome; Highland filed a motion for summary judgment on September 11, 2012.\n\nFollowing a hearing on these motions, the circuit court rejected WVU’s claim of undue\n\nburden. The circuit court stated WVU was “stonewalling” Highland by refusing to\n\nprovide any responsive documents. By order entered November 7, 2012, the circuit court\n\ndenied WVU’s motion to dismiss and deferred a ruling on Highland’s motion for\n\n\narticles, including data discussed but not shown, documents and communications related\nto the selection or rejection of particular mining areas to be examined in the studies,\ncommunications with members of specifically-identified third-party organizations in the\ncourse of preparing the articles, and documents related to the door-to-door health\ninterviews conducted pursuant to the Self-Reported Cancer Study, including sample\ninterview forms and the completed forms.\n        In its other FOIA request (referred to by the parties as the “communications FOIA\nrequest”), Highland requested letters, e-mails and other communications sent to or from\nProfessor Hendryx pertaining to five other articles that he co-authored. In addition, the\ncommunications FOIA request sought peer review comments on drafts of Professor\nHendryx’s articles.\n\n                                           4\n\n\fsummary judgment. The circuit court required that WVU release any responsive\n\ninformation to Highland, and if any responsive documents were withheld from disclosure\n\nor redacted, that WVU provide a Vaughn index3 and explanative affidavit.\n\n\n\n             Thereafter, WVU retained the services of a document management\n\ncompany to electronically manage the production of documents for Highland’s FOIA\n\nrequests. Over the course of this litigation, WVU has made five productions of\n\ndocuments to Highland, producing some 2,364 documents, totaling 11,090 pages. Four of\n\nthose document productions 4 included a separate Vaughn index and corresponding\n\naffidavit, explaining WVU’s decision to redact 119 documents and withhold 772\n\ndocuments.\n\n      3\n         See Syl.

Following briefing, the\n\ncircuit court held a hearing on this motion. On May 30, 2013, the circuit court entered an\n\n“Agreed Order Regarding Preparation of Sample Vaughn Index.” The circuit court\n\nrequired WVU to provide a sample Vaughn index with respect to a limited number of\n\nwithheld documents; this Vaughn index was to include a more detailed explanation of\n\neach withheld document, specifically, how each cited exemption applied to justify the\n\nrespective withholding.\n\n\n\n             On July 17, 2013, WVU provided the sample Vaughn index and the\n\naffidavit of WVU’s associate general counsel. The sample Vaughn index listed ninety-\n\nthree documents that were redacted or withheld from production. According to WVU,\n\nsome documents were withheld on the basis of the FOIA’s “internal memoranda”\n\nexemption, some documents were withheld on the basis of “academic freedom” privilege,\n\nand some documents were withheld on the basis of the FOIA’s “trade secret” exemption.\n\n\n\n             On November 6, 2013, the circuit court entered an “Agreed Order\n\nRegarding Briefing on Outstanding Issues,” pursuant to which it required both parties to\n\nfile renewed motions for summary judgment. Thereafter, the parties filed briefs and\n\nidentified those documents listed on the sample Vaughn index they wanted the circuit\n\ncourt to review in camera.\n                                            6\n\n\f             In Highland’s memorandum of law in support of its renewed motion for\n\nsummary judgment, Highland provided the following factual background regarding its\n\nrequest for documents concerning Professor Hendryx’s work:\n\n                     At all relevant times, Michael Hendryx, Ph.D., was a\n             professor employed by the defendant West Virginia\n             University School of Medicine (“WVU”) who holds degrees\n             in psychology but is not a medical doctor, toxicologist, or\n             epidemiologist. Prof. Hendryx was the Director of the West\n             Virginia Rural Health Research Center, where he and his\n             colleagues received public funds to research rural health\n             issues. In that capacity, Hendryx published taxpayer-funded\n             papers such as those that are the subject of the FOIA\n             Requests, focused on linking coal mining and adverse health\n             impacts. His goal – in his own words – is to convince\n             “politicians” that West Virginia “can have a better economy if\n             we work to create a more diverse economy that does not\n             depend on coal.” He further hopes his studies help eliminate\n             mountaintop removal mining and focus policymakers away\n             from coal and towards “cleaner” forms of energy. He thinks\n             that “tighter standards on emissions controls is an important\n             outcome of [his] research.” He hopes “to get [his papers]\n             more in the eyes of state policy makers” so that “the\n             Appalachian people and governments could consider whether\n             our reliance on coal mining for the economy is a good idea or\n             not.” (footnotes and citations omitted).\n\nHighland requested that the circuit court order WVU to provide all responsive documents\n\nlisted on the sample Vaughn index, arguing they do not fall under any applicable FOIA\n\nexemption. Highland also requested that the circuit court order WVU to confer with\n\nHighland regarding the retrieval and review of additional responsive materials that have\n\nyet to be gathered in response to the FOIA request. Finally, Highland asserted the circuit\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\n\fcourt should award it attorney fees and costs in accordance with West Virginia Code §\n\n29B-1-7 because WVU improperly denied Highland access to the public records.\n\n\n\n              In WVU’s memorandum of law in support of its renewed motion for\n\nsummary judgment, WVU argued:\n\n                     The majority of the documents were withheld or\n              redacted because they contain the preliminary deliberations\n              and research of an academic professor. Specifically, these\n              documents include draft research papers and correspondence\n              between co-authors with comments or suggestions regarding\n              the drafts themselves. Like other state employees (perhaps\n              even more so), these faculty members must be permitted the\n              latitude to craft and hone their work in an environment that\n              fosters the free exchange of ideas.\n\nThus, WVU claimed the documents withheld were exempt from disclosure under the\n\n“internal memoranda” exemption of the FOIA, and/or an “academic freedom” privilege.5\n\nWVU also argued that Highland’s FOIA requests were unduly burdensome because\n\nWVU identified over 240,000 documents that were potentially responsive to Highland’s\n\nrequests and “[t]o date, WVU [had] reviewed 43,733 documents in a process that . . .\n\nspanned the pendency of this case.”\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         In this pleading, WVU did not contend the documents were withheld based on\nthe FOIA’s “trade secret” exemption. WVU stated that although this exemption had been\nasserted previously, it no longer believed the circuit court had to specifically address this\nissue because the same documents covered by the “trade secret” exemption were subject\nto other exemptions asserted by WVU.\n\n                                             8\n\n\f              Following an in camera review of the documents,6 the circuit court entered\n\nan order on March 19, 2014, granting summary judgment to WVU and denying\n\nHighland’s cross-motion. The circuit court held that WVU had properly refused to\n\nprovide all withheld and redacted documents on the basis of: (1) the FOIA’s “internal\n\nmemoranda” exemption found at West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(8); (2) an “academic\n\nfreedom” privilege it incorporated into the FOIA’s “personal privacy” exemption found\n\nat West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2); and/or (3) the FOIA requests were unduly\n\nburdensome. The circuit court did not address Highland’s motion for attorney fees and\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n              On appeal to this Court, Highland raises eight assignments of error. 7\n\nHighland urges this Court to reverse the order of the circuit court and find that WVU\n\n\n         6\n         We note the availability and scope of in camera review is within the discretion of\nthe circuit court. Such review offers a check on the accuracy and honesty of the public\nbody’s asserted exemptions. In camera review is conducted incident to, rather than as a\nsubstitute for, the Vaughn index.\n         7\n         Highland contends: (1) the “internal memoranda” exemption under the FOIA\ndoes not apply to matters involving scientific research and publication of articles by state\nuniversity professors; (2) there is no “academic freedom” exemption under the FOIA; (3)\nthe guarantee of a “thorough and efficient system of free schools” under the West\nVirginia Constitution does not extend to institutions of higher education such as WVU,\nand cannot serve as the basis for an “academic freedom” exemption under the FOIA; (4)\nthe “personal privacy” exemption under the FOIA cannot be applied when no personal or\nidentifying information is sought or threatened to be released; (5) the circuit court failed\nto impose the burden of proof on WVU to establish the applicability of the cited FOIA\nexemptions; (6) WVU either waived its reliance on the “trade secret” exemption under\nthe FOIA or failed to establish it; (7) the circuit court erred in reversing its earlier ruling\nand finding – nearly two years after this action was filed – that Highland’s FOIA requests\n(continued . . .)\n                                               9\n\n\fmust provide the documents requested below.            Highland maintains it needs this\n\ninformation in order to evaluate the internal validity of the studies and the conclusions\n\nreached in Professor Hendryx’s articles. Highland also requests that it be granted its\n\nreasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in prosecuting this action, pursuant to West\n\nVirginia Code § 29B-1-7.\n\n\n\n                             II.

The FOIA’s Internal Memoranda Exemption\n\n             The principal statutory provision at issue in this case, West Virginia Code §\n\n29B-1-4(a)(8) provides: “[i]nternal memoranda or letters received or prepared by any\n\npublic body” are specifically exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.           Through the\n\ndevelopment of case law, this FOIA exemption is commonly referred to as the\n\n“deliberative process” exemption and we use the terms interchangeably. The precise\n\nquestion presented here is an issue of first impression for this Court: whether a state\n\n      9\n         We promptly dispose of Highland’s assignment of error that the circuit court\nfailed to impose the burden of proof on WVU to establish the applicability of the FOIA\nexemptions it asserted. The appendix record reveals the circuit court properly held WVU\nto its burden: WVU produced multiple, detailed Vaughn indices (e.g., the index attached\nto the fourth production of documents was fifty-two pages); filed numerous briefs on the\nmerits of its claimed exemptions; participated in oral arguments; and submitted\ndocuments for the circuit court’s in camera review.\n      10\n         In Highland’s brief to this Court, it argues that WVU either waived its reliance\non the “trade secret” exemption under FOIA or failed to establish it. Because WVU does\nnot argue how the “trade secret” exemption may apply to any documents withheld in this\ncase, we agree. See generally Addair v.

Therefore, WVU\n\nmaintains he or she must be equally and congruently entitled to the protection of this\n\nFOIA exemption. For these public body employees, the public function they are hired to\n\nperform is the research and publication of scholarly articles. WVU contends the\n\n“deliberations” they undertake and the “decisions” the professors make include the final\n\npublication of their research efforts. A public university or college’s “policy” is to\n\nnurture, support, and publish academic research on areas of public concern; its mission is\n\nfulfilled when the article is published. Therefore, WVU maintains that if the deliberative\n\nprocesses of its researchers are open for public inspection, WVU will be unable to fulfill\n\nits mission.\n\n\n\n               In opposition, Highland argues this FOIA exemption does not apply\n\nbecause Professor Hendryx was not engaged in policy making on behalf of WVU when\n\npreparing the subject articles.

Highland acknowledges, however, that Professor Hendryx may\n\nhave sought to influence the development of policy by federal and state agencies\n\nresponsible for regulating surface coal mining, but he had no authority to directly develop\n\nor impose any such policies.\n\n\n\n              We agree with Highland’s factual assessment that while WVU is a public\n\nbody, it is not a state agency engaged in policy making. We further agree that Professor\n\nHendryx did not formulate policy on behalf of WVU when he published the research\n\narticles. Nevertheless, we emphatically reject Highland’s legal argument that WVU may\n\nnot invoke the “internal memoranda” exemption because that exemption covers only\n                                            18\n\n\fdocuments reflecting agency policy making communications. There is a bulk of case law\n\napplying the federal FOIA’s “deliberative process” exemption in the context of\n\nadministrative agency policy/decision making.14 At the same time, however, a plethora of\n\nfederal FOIA cases also extend this exemption to public bodies engaged in activities\n\nother than agency policy making. “In its relatively short life, the deliberative process\n\nprivilege has become one of the most predominate privileges exercised by the\n\ngovernment and is now routinely asserted in a wide array of litigation challenging\n\ngovernment decisionmaking.” Michael Ray Harris, Standing in the Way of Judicial\n\nReview: Assertion of the Deliberative Process Privilege in APA Cases, 53 St. Louis U.\n\nL.J. 349, 350 (2009).\n\n\n\n\n      14\n         The root of this trend may be explained by the fact the federal FOIA represented\nthe culmination of years of congressional effort to amend the public information\nprovisions of the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946.\n\n                     The FOIA replaced Section 3 of the Administrative\n             Procedure Act (APA) of 1946, which ostensibly served as a\n             public information provision to permit the public to gain\n             access to federal records. However, the law was filled with\n             loopholes that the government routinely exploited to withhold\n             records. The main obstacle to public access under the APA\n             was a requirement that record requesters demonstrate that the\n             solicited information pertain directly to them. This restriction\n             prevented journalists, writers, historians, lawyers, and others\n             from gaining access to information held by the federal\n             government.\n\nMartin E.

A plain reading of our FOIA confirms that WVU has the stronger\n\nargument. In West Virginia, administrative agencies are not the only public bodies\n\nsubject to the FOIA and its accompanying exemptions. West Virginia Code § 29B-1­\n\n4(a)(8) exempts from disclosure “internal memoranda or letters received or prepared by\n\nany public body.” Id. (emphasis added). And the definition of “public body” under our\n\nFOIA is extensive:\n\n                      “Public body” means every state officer, agency,\n              department, including the executive, legislative and judicial\n              departments, division, bureau, board and commission; every\n              county and city governing body, school district, special\n              district, municipal corporation, and any board, department,\n              commission, council or agency thereof; and any other body\n              which is created by state or local authority or which is\n              primarily funded by the state or local authority.\n\nId. § 29B-1-2(3).15 The public body entities and their employees set forth above engage\n\nin an immensely diverse range of endeavors related to government service. Therefore, we\n\nexpect their internal deliberations will necessarily address a variety of matters related to\n\ntheir state and/or local governmental responsibilities.\n\n       15\n         The federal FOIA uses the term “agency,” not “public body.” See Pub.

As discussed above, to invoke the “internal\n\nmemoranda” exemption set forth in West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(8) (2012)\n\nsuccessfully, the public body must show that in the context in which the materials are\n\nprepared or considered, the documents are both predecisional and deliberative to its\n\ndecision-making process. Predecisional documents are prepared in order to assist a public\n\nbody decisionmaker in arriving at his or her decision.

Id. at 45. Like Highland sought\n\nin the instant case, Mr. Hooker wanted access to this information to refute the\n\nconclusions reached in the articles. Mr. Hooker contended the HHS and CDC\n\nconsistently denied a relationship between the mercury-based compound and autism, “in\n\nthe face of ‘a mounting body of compelling scientific literature’ that support[ed] the\n\nexistence of such a relationship.” Id. The court rejected Mr. Hooker’s arguments and\n\nfound the HHS and CDC properly applied the federal FOIA “deliberative process”\n                                    23\n\n\fexemption to material that was deliberative in nature when withholding internal\n\ncommunications revealing the analysis underlying the draft manuscripts.

First, considering the context in which the materials were\n\nused, WVU has shown that any document which reveals the analysis underlying\n\nProfessor Hendryx’s articles is predecisional. In the state higher education academic\n\nsetting, documents generated before the final publication of a scientific research article –\n\nall documents related to the initiation, preparation and publication of the articles – are by\n\ntheir very nature predecisional. Second, WVU has shown that any document, regardless\n\nof its nature, that exposes the give-and-take of the scientific research consultative\n\nprocess, by revealing the manner in which the researchers evaluate possible alternative\n\noutcomes, is deliberative. Because these drafts, data compilations 17 and analyses,\n\n\n       17\n          Nearly all Professor Hendryx’s articles that were the subject of Highland’s\nFOIA requests were based on studies using secondary data only.

We find WVU may withhold\ndocuments generated in data compilation because these documents could reveal the\ndeliberative process.

In UVA, a\n\nrequester brought suit under Virginia’s FOIA against the University of Virginia seeking\n\ndisclosure of documents produced or received by a former professor while working at the\n\nuniversity. Id. at 437. The professor was a climate scientist and former professor whose\n\nscholarly work had “generated much scientific and political interest.” Id. Applying a\n\nFOIA exemption,20 the court upheld the university’s exclusion of the documents from\n\nproduction. Id. at 442. In UVA, “many noted scholars and academic administrators\n\nsubmitted affidavits attesting to the harmful impact disclosure would have in these\n\ncircumstances.” Id. The court quoted an affidavit from John Simon, Vice President and\n\n\n       20\n            Virginia Code § 2.2-3705.4(4) (West 2014) provides:\n\n                        Data, records or information of a proprietary nature\n                produced or collected by or for faculty or staff of public\n                institutions of higher education, other than the institutions’\n                financial or administrative records, in the conduct of or as a\n                result of study or research on medical, scientific, technical or\n                scholarly issues, whether sponsored by the institution alone or\n                in conjunction with a governmental body or a private\n                concern, where such data, records or information has not been\n                publicly released, published, copyrighted or patented.\n\n                                              27\n\n\fProvost of the university and former Vice-Provost of Duke University, addressing the\n\nconcerns relevant to academia:\n\n                      If U.S. scientists at public institutions lose the ability\n              to protect their communications with faculty at other\n              institutions, their ability to collaborate will be gravely\n              harmed. The result will be a loss of scientific and creative\n              opportunities for faculty at institutions in states which have\n              not established protections under state FOIAs for such\n              communications. . . . For faculty at public institutions such as\n              the University of Virginia, compelled disclosure of their\n              unpublished thoughts, data, and personal scholarly\n              communications would mean a fundamental disruption of the\n              norms and expectations which have enabled research to\n              flourish at the great public institutions for over a century.\n                      ...\n                      I can state unequivocally that recruitment of faculty to\n              an institution like the University of Virginia will be deeply\n              harmed if such faculty must fear that their unpublished\n              communications with the scientific collaborators and\n              scholarly colleagues are subject to involuntary public\n              disclosure.\n\nId. at 442.\n\n\n\n              The same reasoning applies with equal force here.21 When we focus on the\n\nresulting effect of the documents’ release, the resolution of this case is decidedly clear.\n\n\n       21\n          The UVA case best illuminates the public policy facet of the issue before us. If\nWest Virginia State colleges and universities cannot retain their researchers and scientists\nbecause the FOIA exposes them to an unfair intrusion into the scientific process, then the\nproblem of operating in a “fishbowl” pales in comparison to the challenge of attracting\nand retaining highly qualified faculty. See generally Dianna G. Goldenson, FOIA\nExemption Five: Will it Protect Government Scientists From Unfair Intrusion?, 29 B.C.\nEnvtl. Aff. L. Rev. 311 (2002) (arguing federal FOIA “deliberative process” exemption\nshould be recognized by courts as mode of protecting government scientists from unfair\nintrusion into scientific research).\n\n                                             28\n\n\fThe involuntary public disclosure of Professor Hendryx’s research documents would\n\nexpose the decision-making process in such a way as to hinder candid discussion of\n\nWVU’s faculty and undermine WVU’s ability to perform its operations. We\n\nacknowledge that West Virginia’s FOIA does not have an exemption specifically\n\napplicable to state institutions of higher education like Virginia does. Nevertheless, we\n\nfind that documents generated during higher education academic research may be legally\n\nprotected from disclosure under West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(8), when the public\n\nbody demonstrates the criteria outlined above are satisfied. Accordingly, we affirm the\n\norder of the circuit court insofar as it found WVU properly invoked the FOIA “internal\n\nmemoranda” exemption to withhold certain documents.\n\n\n\n                     B. The FOIA’s Personal Privacy Exemption\n\n             The FOIA’s “personal privacy” exemption permits the withholding of\n\n“information of a personal nature such as that kept in a personal, medical or similar\n\nfile[.]” W.Va. Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2). In syllabus point six of Hechler v.

(footnote added). We employ a two-\n\npronged inquiry in deciding whether the public body has correctly withheld records under\n\n      22\n          The syllabus point cites West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(2) (1977), which\ncontains the same language as West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2) (2012).\n\n                                           29\n\n\fthis exemption. First, we determine whether the records in question are “personal,”\n\n“medical,” or “similar” files. Second, if so, we then balance or weigh the individual’s\n\nright of privacy against “the public’s right to know.” Hechler, 175 W.Va. at 444, 333\n\nS.E.2d at 810.\n\n\n\n              Our analysis is consistent with case law interpreting the federal FOIA\n\ncounterpart. The federal FOIA exemption provides that government can withhold\n\n“personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a\n\nclearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) (2009). See\n\nMartin E. Halstuk, When Is An Invasion of Privacy Unwarranted Under the FOIA? An\n\nAnalysis of the Supreme Court’s “Sufficient Reason” and “Presumption of Legitimacy”\n\nStandards, 16 U.Fla.J.L. & Pub. Pol’y 361, 371 (2005) (“When an agency makes a\n\ndetermination in a privacy-interests case[,] . . . it first must decide whether the requested\n\nrecords fall within the definition of ‘personnel,’ ‘medical,’ or ‘similar’ files. Second, the\n\nagency must balance the invasion of the individual’s personal privacy against the public’s\n\ninterest in disclosure to determine whether the disclosure is justified.”) (footnotes\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n              Here, the circuit court concluded WVU properly withheld 740 documents\n\non the basis of “academic freedom,” a concept which it incorporated into the FOIA’s\n\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\n\f                                 23\n“personal privacy” exemption.         The circuit court conceded that its ruling was\n\nunprecedented. The circuit court’s holding rested upon three distinct considerations: (1)\n\nthe First Amendment encompasses an “academic freedom” privilege that is\n\n“transcendental, applicable to both constitutional law and to FOIA”; (2) the guarantee set\n\nforth in the West Virginia Constitution that provides all citizens have a right to a\n\nthorough and efficient educational system; and (3) the determination that individual peer\n\nreviewers have an expectation of privacy that will be harmed by the release of their\n\ncomments, even though such comments are submitted anonymously.\n\n\n\n             We summarily reject the first two considerations outlined above. First, the\n\nWest Virginia Freedom of Information Act does not provide an “academic freedom”\n\nexemption to its general disclosure provision, West Virginia Code § 29B-1-3 (2012).\n\nAlthough the First Amendment has been held to apply to protect colleges and universities\n\nagainst undue interference by the government,24 First Amendment jurisprudence does not\n\n\n      23\n        The circuit court noted, however, that the “deliberative process” exemption\nwould shield the same documents from disclosure.\n      24\n          The primary case cited by WVU on this issue, Sweezy v. New Hampshire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105533\"><a href=\"/opinion/105533/sweezy-v-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1957), is not relevant to the instant case. Sweezy was decided on the basis of a\ndenial of due process, in the form of an open-ended, unlimited investigation of the\npersonal conduct and affairs of a faculty member. The Supreme Court in Sweezy dealt\nwith a challenge to the use of a New Hampshire statute to hold a university professor in\ncontempt for failing to answer questions posed to him (by the New Hampshire Attorney\nGeneral, on behalf of the Legislature) concerning his belief in Communism and\ninvolvement with the Progressive Party. Id. at 242-244. This case did not involve the\nfederal FOIA or any similar statute, nor did it involve the professor’s research\nactivities/scientific publications.\n\n                                            31\n\n\fsupport its application in the context of this case. Because the exemptions to the Act are\n\nrequired to be strictly construed, this Court declines to create an “academic freedom”\n\nexemption not specifically set forth in the FOIA. See Syl.

This Court has further cautioned that “[a]\n\nstatute, or an administrative rule, may not, under the guise of ‘interpretation,’ be\n\nmodified, revised, amended or rewritten.” Syl.

Therefore, we find the broad\n\nprinciple of “academic freedom” would not justify WVU’s wholesale avoidance of the\n\nplain language of the FOIA. 25\n\n\n\n              Second, the guarantee of a “thorough and efficient system of free schools”\n\nunder the West Virginia Constitution does not extend to institutions of higher education\n\nsuch as WVU. See W.Va. Const. art. XII, § 1; Syl. Pt. 7, Randolph Co.

Our Constitution does not\n\nestablish a right to a higher education; the circuit court’s reliance on this principle was\n\nentirely misplaced.\n\n\n\n              We now turn to the third consideration set forth above. The pertinent issue\n\nhere is whether Highland’s request for “[a]ll comments by peer reviewers concerning\n\ndrafts of the documents” constitute “information of a personal nature” within the meaning\n\nof the privacy exemption at West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2). WVU asserts the peer\n\nreviewers’ privacy expectations would be violated by the release of their anonymous,\n\nconfidential comments. The identity of peer reviewers is traditionally kept confidential in\n\norder to facilitate a candid exchange regarding a proposed article and its research. WVU\n\nmaintains that to subject a reviewer’s comments to public scrutiny, even while keeping\n\nthe identity of the reviewer withheld, would render a reviewer more reluctant to challenge\n\ntraditional ideas and propose unconventional concepts.\n\n\n\n              Highland responds that WVU’s argument “stands the notion of ‘personal’\n\ninformation on its ear.” Applying the plain meaning of the word “personal,” Highland\n\nargues this exemption cannot apply to peer review comments, submitted anonymously to\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\n\fan academic or scientific journal, that are not kept in a “personal, medical, or similar file”\n\npertaining to the person who prepared them. We agree.\n\n\n\n              This Court finds that WVU fails to meet the first prong of Hechler because\n\nthe records in question are not “personal, medical or similar file[s]” that fall under the\n\nFOIA’s “personal privacy” exemption. W.Va. Code § 29B-1-4(a)(2). In fact, these\n\nanonymous peer review comments contain no personal identifying information at all.\n\nTherefore, the only case relied upon by WVU on this issue is distinguishable from the\n\ninstant case. In Cook v. National Archives & Records Administration, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2nd\n\nCir. 2014), the court held records pertaining to research requests made on behalf of\n\nformer President and former Vice President for records from their own administration\n\nwere “similar files” to “personnel” files exempt under the federal FOIA “personal\n\nprivacy” exemption, because “they contain[ed] detailed records containing personal\n\ninformation identifiable to the former officials and their representatives.” Id. at 175.\n\n\n\n              Because WVU fails to meet the first prong of Hechler, our analysis stops\n\nhere; we need not proceed to address the second prong to balance or weigh the\n\nindividual’s right of privacy against “the public’s right to know.” 175 W.Va. at 444, 333\n\nS.E.2d at 810. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the circuit court insofar as it found\n\nthat WVU properly withheld documents on the basis of “academic freedom,” as it\n\nincorporated into the FOIA’s “personal privacy” exemption set forth in West Virginia\n\nCode § 29B-1-4(a)(2).\n                                             34\n\n\f              We do, however, agree with the circuit court’s finding that the same\n\ndocuments would fall under the FOIA “internal memoranda” exemption. As previously\n\ndiscussed, disclosure of the anonymous peer review comments submitted to Professor\n\nHendryx, as he was drafting the articles, would undercut the decision-making process\n\nembodied by the FOIA’s exemption and discourage open discussion necessary for\n\nscientific/academic research. See Daily Gazette I, 198 W. Va. at 572, 482 S.E.2d at 189\n\n(stating that “in the spirit of further promoting frank and open discussions during an\n\nagency’s deliberative process, courts have interpreted the deliberative process privilege to\n\ninclude opinions and recommendations to a governmental agency by outside consultants\n\nand experts so long as such opinions or recommendations are obtained during the\n\ngovernment agency’s deliberative, predecisional process”).\n\n\n\n                          C. Reasonableness of FOIA Request\n\n              WVU initially moved to dismiss this action claiming the FOIA requests\n\nwere unduly burdensome. The circuit court denied this motion and WVU engaged in\n\ndocument review and production. WVU produced 2,364 documents, totaling 11,090\n\npages and redacted 119 of those documents; WVU withheld 772 documents and claimed\n\nthe FOIA exemptions discussed above. By the time the circuit court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of WVU, the university claimed to have reviewed over 40,000\n\ndocuments and identified over 200,000 potentially responsive documents.\n\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\n\f              In its March 19, 2014, order, the circuit court found “at this point,” WVU\n\nhad demonstrated that the FOIA requests were unduly burdensome, and noted it was\n\nconcerned about the time and expense that “would be required to complete the process[.]”\n\nWVU maintains the circuit court correctly found that the past two years of litigation and\n\ndocument production proved Highland’s FOIA requests were unduly burdensome. WVU\n\nargues that while the FOIA is designed to foster public transparency and accountability,\n\nthe Act also reflects the Legislature’s “concern that information requests not become\n\nmechanisms to paralyze other necessary government functions.” Farley, 215 W.Va. at\n\n422 n.14, 599 S.E.2d at 845 n.14.\n\n\n\n              Highland counters that the circuit court inexplicably failed to address its\n\nvoluntary offer to limit or potentially eliminate the need for further document processing.\n\nIn response to a letter from WVU’s counsel pointing out the anticipated cost to process\n\nthat information, Highland’s counsel agreed that WVU could defer processing of those\n\ndocuments pending further rulings. In addition, Highland noted that if the documents that\n\nhave been withheld thus far were provided, Highland may decide that it does not wish to\n\nreceive any of the remaining documents. In accordance with this discussion, in its Cross-\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment, Highland only requested the release of previously-\n\nwithheld documents as listed in the Vaughn indices, and that WVU be required to confer\n\nwith Highland as to any additional documents.\n\n\n\n\n                                            36\n\n\f              To be sure, the FOIA requires a public body to conduct a reasonable search\n\nfor responsive records. Further,\n\n                     [i]n response to a proper Freedom of Information Act\n              request, a public body has a duty to redact or segregate\n              exempt from non-exempt information contained within the\n              public record(s) responsive to the FOIA request and to\n              disclose the nonexempt information unless such segregation\n              or redaction would impose upon the public body an\n              unreasonably high burden or expense. If the public body\n              refuses to provide redacted or segregated copies because the\n              process of redacting or segregating would impose an\n              unreasonably high burden or expense, the public body must\n              provide the requesting party a written response that is\n              sufficiently detailed to justify refusal to honor the FOIA\n              request on these grounds. Such written response, however,\n              need not be so detailed that the justification would\n              compromise the secret nature of the exempt information.\n\nSyl.

See House Bill\n2636, 2015 Leg. 82nd Sess. (W.Va. 2015) (effective June 12, 2015) (authorizing public\nbody to establish fees reasonably calculated to reimburse actual costs in making\nreproductions of records; public body may not charge search or retrieval fee as part of\ncosts associated with making reproduction of records).\n\n                                            38\n\n\f             Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court’s order insofar as it dismissed this\n\naction and remand the case for further proceedings. We find Highland should have the\n\nopportunity to taper its FOIA requests correspondent to our holdings in this case.\n\nThereafter, the circuit court should revisit its decision of whether Highland’s FOIA\n\nrequests are unduly burdensome. Applying this Court’s ruling, the circuit court will find\n\nthat WVU’s document production obligations are dramatically reduced. If the circuit\n\ncourt does not dismiss this action, it should consider appointing a special commissioner\n\npursuant to Rule 53 of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure to review any\n\ndocuments withheld by WVU, in camera, to determine whether they are exempt from\n\ndisclosure under the FOIA. Further, the parties are expected to confer regarding the fees\n\nHighland may incur with respect to any further document processing and production by\n\nWVU.\n\n\n\n                 D. Highland’s Request for Attorney Fees and Costs\n\n             The FOIA provides that any person who is a successful FOIA litigant must\n\nbe awarded attorney fees and costs. Specifically, West Virginia Code § 29B-1-7 provides:\n\n             [a]ny person who is denied access to public records requested\n             pursuant to this article and who successfully brings a suit\n             filed pursuant to section five of this article shall be entitled to\n             recover his or her attorney fees and court costs from the\n             public body that denied him or her access to the records.\n\nIn syllabus point seven of Daily Gazette Co. v.

Code § 29B­\n              1-5 (1977) (Repl.Vol.1998), so as to entitle him/her to an\n              award of attorney’s fees for “successfully” bringing such suit\n              pursuant to W.Va. Code § 29B-1-7 (1992) (Repl.Vol.1998),\n              he/she need not have prevailed on every argument he/she\n              advanced during the FOIA proceedings or have received the\n              full and complete disclosure of every public record he/she\n              wished to inspect or examine. An award of attorney’s fees is\n              proper even when some of the requested records are ordered\n              to be disclosed while others are found to be exempt from\n              disclosure or are released in redacted form. In the final\n              analysis, a successful FOIA action, such as would warrant an\n              award of attorney’s fees as authorized by W.Va. Code § 29B­\n              1-7, is one which has contributed to the defendant’s\n              disclosure, whether voluntary or by order of court, of the\n              public records originally denied the plaintiff.\n\n\n              Highland contends the circuit court erred in neglecting to address its\n\nrequest for attorney fees and costs. While WVU disagrees, Highland argues it\n\nsuccessfully brought this FOIA suit because WVU originally denied it access to any\n\npublic records, and, WVU was forced to produce more than 2,200 documents in\n\ncompliance with the circuit court’s November 7, 2012 order. WVU argues that the\n\ncircuit court’s final ruling that Highland’s FOIA requests were unduly burdensome\n\neliminates its claim for attorney fees and costs.\n\n\n\n              “Typically, we have steadfastly held to the rule that we will not address a\n\nnonjurisdictional issue that has not been determined by the lower court.” State ex rel.\n\nClark v.
