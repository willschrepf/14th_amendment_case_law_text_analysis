Mr. Cunningham appears pro se. He recently has filed a slew of\n\nmotions, see Dkt. Nos. 16, 19, 20, 26, 27, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, and 44, that seek to\n\nobtain summary judgment, compel various Defendants and other non-parties to produce records\n\nor affidavits, and sanction certain Defendants for perceived wrongdoing.          For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, the Court will dismiss this case and deny the motions as moot.\n\n                                            I. FACTS\n\n               A. Background\n\n               Mr. Cunningham is a repeat litigator, which gives the Court the advantage of\n\nknowing the origins of his claims. See, e.g., Cunningham v. O’Neill, Case No. 13-960(RMC),\n\n2013 WL 3753554 (D.D.C. July 17, 2013). 1 According to Mr. Cunningham, Deputy Marshals of\n\nthe United States Marshal Service (USMS) executed a search warrant and entered his New York\n1\n  In O’Neill, Mr. Cunningham filed a FOIA suit against ten individual federal officials, several of\nwhom also are named in the instant lawsuit. Because FOIA covers only agencies in the\nexecutive branch of government, 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1), the case was dismissed for failure to state\na claim. See O’Neill, 2013 WL 3753554, at *2.\n                                                1\n\fCity residence in 2005. In the process of their search, the Deputy Marshals handcuffed Mr.\n\nCunningham while looking for his fugitive brother. Still handcuffed, Mr. Cunningham fled his\n\nhome and ran into a bus carrying city transit officer-candidates.      Those officers held Mr.\n\nCunningham until the Deputy Marshals retrieved and, ultimately, released him.                See\n\nCunningham v. U.S. Congress House Ethics Comm., Civil Case No. 12-1935(RMC) (Compl.\n\n[Dkt. 1]). 2   Defendants state that no criminal charges were ever filed against any law\n\nenforcement officer(s) in connection with these events, Am. Mot. for Summ. J. (Def.’s Mem.)\n\n[Dkt. 24] at 2, a fact Mr. Cunningham does not contest. Mr. Cunningham’s subsequent efforts to\n\nbe designated a crime victim under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771,\n\nproved unsuccessful. Pl.’s Mot. to Compel, Ex. 1 [Dkt. 7-1] at 27. 3\n\n               Mr. Cunningham has brought at least three suits regarding these alleged events in\n\ntwo other jurisdictions. In the Southern District of New York, Mr. Cunningham sued the\n\nindividual Deputy Marshals and a New York Police Department detective for alleged Fourth and\n\nFifth Amendment violations, and, in a separate suit, he sought a writ of mandamus compelling\n\nthe Federal Crime Victim Office to provide him crime-victim benefits and counseling, to pay his\n\nmedical bills related to injuries he sustained on the day his home was searched, and to reimburse\n\nhim for cash allegedly taken during the 2005 search of his home. The former suit was dismissed\n\nin favor of the defendants on summary judgment and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second\n\nCircuit dismissed the ensuing appeal as frivolous. See Cunningham v. McCluskey, Civil Action\n\n2\n  In U.S. Congress House Ethics Comm., Mr. Cunningham sued U.S. Representative José\nSerrano and the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ethics. The case was dismissed\nbecause congressional members and committees are immune from suit for official duties under\nthe Speech or Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution. See Civil Case No. 12-1935(RMC)\n(D.D.C. Feb. 14, 2013) (Order [Dkt. 5] at 2-3); U.S. Const. art. I, § 6.\n3\n  For ease of reference, page numbers cited here relating to Mr. Cunningham’s pleadings come\nfrom the pagination inserted by the electronic case-filing system.\n                                                2\n\fNo. 05-10169(DAB), 2011 WL 3478312 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 8, 2011) (adopting magistrate judge’s\n\nreport and recommendation and determining that qualified immunity barred Mr. Cunningham’s\n\nFourth Amendment claim and the availability of a remedy under the Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n(FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671 et seq., rendered his Fifth Amendment due process claim\n\nnon-cognizable), appeal dismissed, Civil Action No. 11-3597 (2d Cir. Feb. 14, 2012) (mandate),\n\ncert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 124 (Oct. 1, 2012).       The latter suit was dismissed as well.    See\n\nCunningham v. Gillis, Civil Action No. 09-cv-1768 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2009) (Order [Dkt. 3])\n\n(finding no factual or legal basis for requiring the Federal Crime Victim Office to extend crime\n\nvictim benefits to Mr. Cunningham). Before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, Mr. Cunningham\n\nfiled a breach of contract action, claiming that, among others, the magistrate judge and district\n\ncourt judge in McCluskey had improperly handled the case and conspired against him. The\n\nCourt of Federal Claims dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, and the Federal Circuit\n\naffirmed. Cunningham v. United States, Civil Action No. 11-330C, 2011 WL 5825147 (Fed. Cl.\n\nNov. 16, 2011), aff’d, 479 F. App’x 974 (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n\n              B. Mr. Cunningham’s FOIA Requests\n\n              Mr. Cunningham now has turned to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in an\n\nattempt to locate documents to prove his claims. In 2012, Mr. Cunningham filed FOIA Requests\n\nNos. 12-3595, 12-4031, 1206853, and 13-00146. All of these requests pertained either to the\n\n2005 search of his home or the refusal to designate Mr. Cunningham a crime victim.\n\n              1. FOIA Request No. 12-3595\n\n              On July 26, 2012, Mr. Cunningham sent a FOIA request to the Department of\n\nJustice’s (DOJ) Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA) asking for a copy of its “written\n\ndecision . . . concerning [Mr. Cunningham’s] pro-se filed Misconduct Complaint” against\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fAssistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) Peter M. Skinner, who defended USMS in McCluskey. See\n\nDefs.’ Ex. 9 (Luczynski Decl.) [Dkt. 21-9] ¶ 4; Luczynski Decl., Ex. A [Dkt. 21-10]. EOUSA\n\ndesignated the request as FOIA Request No. 12-3595 and directed the U.S. Attorney’s Office for\n\nthe Southern District of New York (USAO-SDNY) to perform a search for responsive records.\n\nLuczynski Decl. ¶ 5; Defs.’ Ex. 11 (Smith Decl.) [Dkt. 21-11] ¶ 5. USAO-SDNY searched the\n\nLegal Information Office Network System (LIONS), which indicates whether a case is open or\n\nclosed and whom to contact concerning the identification of responsive records, and the Public\n\nAccess to Court Electronic Records (PACER), which provides additional case information.\n\nSmith Decl. ¶¶ 2, 5. USAO-SDNY then sent an email to AUSA David Kennedy, Chief of the\n\nCivil Rights Unit at USAO-SDNY, requesting all records pertaining to Mr. Cunningham. On\n\nOctober 1, 2012, USAO-SDNY reviewed, compiled and sent responsive records to EOUSA. Id.\n\n¶¶ 5-6. On October 24, 2012, EOUSA released to Mr. Cunningham 33 pages in full and\n\nwithheld four pages under FOIA Exemption (b)(5). 4 Luczynski Decl. ¶ 5. EOUSA also notified\n\nMr. Cunningham that its review had located potentially responsive records that originated from\n\nUSMS, the DOJ Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Department of Health and Human\n\nServices (HHS), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). It stated that the additional\n\nrecords had been referred to these entities, which would respond directly to Mr. Cunningham.\n\nId.; Luczynski Decl., Ex. B [Dkt. 21-10]. 5\n\n\n\n\n4\n    Mr. Cunningham does not challenge this application of the exemption.\n5\n  Mr. Cunningham does not challenge the responses of DOJ OIG, HHS, or the FBI to FOIA\nRequest No. 12-3595. With respect to USMS, it appears that the Amended Complaint has\nattempted to sue eleven individuals––Defendants O’Neill, Gillis, Turman, O’Rourke, Kennedy,\nBober, Ricigliano, Does, Norris, Sand, an unnamed confidential informant, and Serrano––for\nalleged deficiencies in the records production by USMS. See infra p. 7-9.\n                                                4\n\f               2. FOIA Request No. 12-4031\n\n               On August 10, 2012, Mr. Cunningham sent a complaint to the FBI. Luczynski\n\nDecl. ¶ 6. It stated that Marie O’Rourke of the Federal Crime Victims Ombudsman Office,\n\nAUSA Kennedy, and FBI Special Agent (SA) Kristina Norris had “refused to provide their\n\nwritten decision concerning [Mr. Cunningham’s] federal crime victim status.” Luczynski Decl.,\n\nEx. C [Dkt. 21-10]. The FBI treated the letter as a FOIA request and forwarded it to EOUSA on\n\nSeptember 26, 2012. On that date, Mr. Cunningham asked EOUSA to expedite the request.\n\nLuczynski Decl. ¶¶ 6-7; Luczynski Decl., Ex. D [Dkt. 21-10].          Two weeks later, EOUSA\n\nassigned number 12-4031 to Mr. Cunningham’s August 10, 2012, complaint letter (FOIA\n\nRequest No. 12-4031) and informed Mr. Cunningham that it would not expedite his request but\n\ninstead process it in the order it was received. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 8; Luczynski Decl., Ex. E [Dkt.\n\n21-10].\n\n               On October 16, 2012, EOUSA directed USAO-SDNY to perform a search for\n\nrecords responsive to FOIA Request 12-4031. Smith Decl. ¶ 4; Smith Decl., Ex. A [Dkt. 21-\n\n12]. Because USAO-SDNY recently had performed a search in connection with FOIA Request\n\nNo. 12-3595, USAO-SDNY asked only AUSA Kennedy and its Victim Witness Coordinator to\n\nsearch for records concerning Mr. Cunningham and his status as a federal crime victim. Neither\n\nAUSA Kennedy nor the Victim Witness Coordinator located any responsive records. Smith\n\nDecl. ¶ 7. EOUSA subsequently informed Mr. Cunningham on November 8, 2012, that its\n\nsearch pertaining to FOIA Request No. 12-4031 had not revealed any responsive records.\n\nLuczynski Decl. ¶ 9; Luczynski Decl., Ex. F [Dkt. 21-10].\n\n               Mr. Cunningham appealed this response to the Office of Information Policy\n\n(OIP), which oversees agency compliance with FOIA. On December 21, 2012, OIP affirmed\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fEOUSA’s handling and conclusion on FOIA Request No. 12-4031. Luczynski Decl. ¶¶ 10-12.\n\nIt again told Mr. Cunningham that EOUSA “could not locate records responsive to his request”\n\nand concluded that EOUSA’s search was “adequate” and “reasonable.” Luczynski Decl., Ex. I\n\n[Dkt. 21-10].\n\n                3. FOIA Request No. 1206853\n\n                On December 5, 2012, Mr. Cunningham wrote again to the FBI, this time asking\n\nfor a copy of his “Federal Crime Victim Status Written Decision.” Defs.’ Ex. 13 (Hardy Decl.)\n\n[Dkt. 21-13] ¶ 5; Hardy Decl., Ex. A [Dkt. 21-14]. The FBI designated this request FOIA\n\nRequest No. 1206853 on January 29, 2013. The FBI searched the indices of its Central Records\n\nSystem (CRS) for responsive records and coordinated additional searches by the Office for\n\nVictim Assistance (OVA) and SA Norris. Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 6, 17-20; Hardy Decl., Ex. B [Dkt. 21-\n\n14]. CRS is the FBI’s electronic repository for information compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes as well as administrative, applicant, criminal, personnel, and other files. Hardy Decl.\n\n¶ 11. It is accessed via General Indices and an Automated Case Support System (ACS), which\n\nconsists of Investigative Case Management, Electronic Case File, and a Universal Index, by\n\nsearching for the subject. Id. ¶¶ 11-15.\n\n                On February 1, 2013, the FBI informed Mr. Cunningham that it had not located\n\nany records responsive to FOIA Request No. 1206853. Hardy Decl. ¶ 7; Hardy Decl., Ex. C\n\n[Dkt. 21-14]. Mr. Cunningham appealed to OIP on February 6, 2013, but OIP closed the case\n\nafter Mr. Cunningham filed the instant suit. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.9(a)(3). See also Hardy Decl. ¶¶\n\n8-9; Hardy Decl., Ex. D [Dkt. 21-14]; Hardy Decl. Ex., E [Dkt. 21-14]; Hardy Decl., Ex. F [Dkt.\n\n21-14].\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f               4. FOIA Request No. 13-00146\n\n               Mr. Cunningham’s last FOIA request before this Court was sent to the DOJ’s\n\nOffice of Justice Programs (OJP) on January 23, 2013. He requested “all documents [concerning\n\nhis status as a federal crime victim] and a copy of [his] Federal Crime Victim Status Written\n\nDecision.” Defs.’ Ex. 15 (Lee Decl.) [Dkt. 21-15] ¶ 3; Lee Decl., Ex. A [Dkt. 21-16]. OJP\n\nassigned number 13-00146 (FOIA Request No. 13-00146) to Mr. Cunningham’s January 23\n\nrequest and directed the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) to conduct a search for responsive\n\nrecords. Lee Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5. Ultimately, both OJP and OVC conducted searches that located 50\n\npages of responsive material. Lee Decl. ¶¶ 5-8. On March 1, 2013, OJP produced the 50 pages\n\nin full to Mr. Cunningham. Id. ¶ 9; Lee Decl., Ex. F [Dkt. 21-21]. OJP realized on May 30,\n\n2013, that it had omitted two responsive documents, consisting of three pages, from its March 1,\n\n2013 production to Mr. Cunningham. It produced these pages in full on June 3, 2013. Lee Decl.\n\n¶ 10, Lee Decl., Ex. G [Dkt. 21-22].\n\n               C. The Instant Litigation\n\n               Mr. Cunningham seeks to compel the release of records concerning the decision\n\nto deny him federal crime victim status. Compl. [Dkt. 1] at 14. In his initial Complaint filed on\n\nFebruary 12, 2013, Mr. Cunningham named Representative Serrano, DOJ, the FBI and EOUSA. 6\n\nId. at 1-2. He claimed that Representative Serrano and employees of DOJ, the FBI, and EOUSA\n\n“[w]illfully CONCEAL[ED]” records relating to his request for federal crime victim status. Id.\n\nat 4.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Mr. Cunningham named USAO-SDNY, not EOUSA, but the Court has substituted EOUSA\nbecause it is the executive office for all of the Offices of the U.S. Attorneys and is the proper\ndefendant.\n                                                7\n\f               On March 20, 2013, Mr. Cunningham filed an Amended Complaint, seeking $5\n\nmillion in damages. 7 See Civil Cover Sheet [Dkt. 1-2] at 2. Renewing his FOIA request for\n\ndocuments pertaining to the denial of his federal crime victim status, he named eleven\n\nindividuals as co-Defendants: (1) Sean R. O’Neill, Chief of the Administrative Appeals Staff at\n\nOIP; (2) John W. Gillis, former Director of OVC; 8 (3) Kathryn Turman, Program Director of\n\nOVA; 9 (4) Marie A. O’Rourke; (5) AUSA Kennedy; (6) AUSA David V. Bober; 10 (7) Deputy\n\nU.S. Marshal Nicholas Ricigliano; (8) SA Norris; (9) Judge Leonard B. Sand of the U.S. District\n\nCourt for the Southern District of New York; (10) an unnamed “Reliable Confidential\n\nInformant” to USMS; and (11) Congressman Serrano. Am. Compl. [Dkt. 6] at 1-3. After Mr.\n\nCunningham filed suit, the FBI conducted a customary second search, in accordance with its\n\npolicy. Def.’s Mem. at 12-13. The only differences between the searches were that in the\n\nsecond search the FBI searched both main files and cross-references and spelled the entire word\n\n“crime.” Hardly Decl. ¶ 19 & n.2. Mr. Cunningham alleges that Deputy Marshal Ricigliano\n\nillegally searched his home and seized his person, and the individual Defendants violated his\n\n7\n  Although the interposition of an amended pleading ordinarily nullifies the original pleading, see\n6 Charles Allen Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1476 (3d ed. 2013), because Mr.\nCunningham is pro se and in the interest of justice and judicial economy, the Court will consider\nclaims in the original Complaint and in the Amended Complaint. See Sieverding v. Dep’t of\nJustice, 693 F. Supp. 2d 93, 101 n.2 (D.D.C. 2010) (addressing claims made in pro se plaintiffs’\noriginal and amended complaints in light of the court’s “obligation to construe pro se filings\nliberally” (quoting Toolasprashad v. Bur. of Prisons, 286 F.3d 576, 583 (D.C. Cir. 2002),\ndenying mot. to amend 910 F. Supp. 2d 149 (D.D.C. 2012)).\n8\n  While Mr. Cunningham’s Amended Complaint names John W. Gills as a Defendant, the Court\nagrees with Defendants that he likely meant to name John W. Gillis, who held the relevant job\ntitle. See Def.’s Mem. at 2 n.6.\n9\n Defendants state that Mr. Cunningham erroneously identifies Ms. Turman as an employee of\nOVC. Id. at 2 n.7.\n10\n  Defendants state that AUSA Bober works for the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.\nId. at 3 n.9.\n                                                8\n\frights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as his\n\nstatutory rights under CRVA, by “willfully” destroying documents concerning his federal crime\n\nvictim status. Am. Compl. at 14, 34. He also demands the production of responsive records\n\nmaintained by USMS from the individual Defendants. Id. at 9.\n\n              Mr. Cunningham moved for summary judgment on May 17, 2013. See Pl.’s Mot.\n\nfor Summ. J. [Dkt. 16]. Defendants opposed on May 29, 2013, see Defs.’ Opp’n [Dkt. 17], and\n\ncross-moved for summary judgment and dismissal of the litigation on June 12, 2013. See Defs.’\n\nMot. for Summ. J. [Dkt. 21]. The Court entered a Fox-Neal Order on June 14, 2013. 11 See\n\nOrder [Dkt. 23]; see also Neal v. Kelly, 963 F.2d 453 (D.C. Cir. 1992); Fox v. Strickland, 837\n\nF.2d 507 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Pursuant to the June 14 Order, Mr. Cunningham filed his Opposition\n\nto Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment on July 11, 2013. See Pl.’s Opp’n [Dkt. 28].\n\n                                  II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n              A. FOIA\n\n              FOIA requires federal agencies to release government records to the public upon\n\nrequest, subject to nine listed exceptions. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b); Wolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370, 374\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2007). A plaintiff complaining that an agency failed to comply with FOIA must show\n\nthat an agency has (1) improperly (2) withheld (3) agency records. Dep’t of Justice v. Tax\n\nAnalysts, 492 U.S. 136, 142 (1989); United We Stand Am., Inc. v. IRS, 359 F.3d 595, 598 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2004). FOIA authorizes suit only against federal agencies, and the only remedy it provides\n\nfor the improper withholding of records is injunctive relief. Kissinger v. Reporters Comm. for\n\nFreedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980); see also 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(4)(B), 552(f)(1).\n\n11\n  On June 14, 2013, Defendants filed an amended Memorandum of Law in connection with their\nMotion to Dismiss and Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court did not issue another Fox-\nNeal Order because it determined that the differences between Defendants’ original and amended\nMemoranda were the result of scrivener’s error.\n                                               9\n\fThat means that FOIA is remedied by ordering the production of agency records without money\n\ndamages. See, e.g., Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. v. Dep’t of the Interior, 88 F.3d 1191, 1203\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1996) (finding FOIA only calls for releasing records to a complainant, not publishing\n\nthe records in the Federal Register). Once requested records are produced, there is no longer a\n\ncase or controversy, and the FOIA action becomes moot. See Armstrong v. Exec. Office of the\n\nPresident, 97 F.3d 575, 582 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\n              A defending agency in a FOIA case must show that its search for responsive\n\nrecords was adequate, that any exemptions claimed actually apply, and that any reasonably\n\nsegregable non-exempt parts of records have been disclosed after redaction of exempt\n\ninformation. See Sanders v. Obama, 729 F. Supp. 2d 148, 154 (D.D.C. 2010), aff’d, Sanders v.\n\nDep’t of Justice, Civ. No. 10-5273, 2011 WL 1769099 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 21, 2011). The adequacy\n\nof a search is measured by a standard of reasonableness and depends on the individual\n\ncircumstances of each case. Truitt v. Dep’t of State, 897 F.2d 540, 542 (D.C. Cir. 1990). The\n\nquestion is not whether other responsive records may exist, but whether the search itself was\n\nadequate. Steinberg v. Dep’t of Justice, 23 F.3d 548, 551 (D.C. Cir. 1994).\n\n              Thus, to rebut a challenge to the adequacy of a search, the agency need only show\n\nthat “the search was reasonably calculated to discover the requested documents, not whether it\n\nactually uncovered every document extant.” SafeCard Servs. Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1201\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1991) (citing Meeropol v. Meese, 790 F.2d 942, 950-51 (D.C. Cir. 1986)). Agencies\n\nare not required to search every record system, but agencies must conduct a good faith,\n\nreasonable search of those systems of records likely to possess the requested records. Oglesby v.\n\nDep’t of Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990), overruled in part on other grounds, 79 F.3d\n\n1172 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\f               An agency may prove the reasonableness of its search by a declaration by\n\nresponsible agency officials, so long as the declaration(s) is reasonably detailed and not\n\ncontroverted by contrary evidence or evidence of bad faith. Military Audit Project, 656 F.2d at\n\n738. An agency affidavit can demonstrate reasonableness by “setting forth the search terms and\n\nthe type of search performed, and averring that all files likely to contain responsive materials (if\n\nsuch records exist) were searched.” Valencia-Lucena v. Coast Guard, 180 F.3d 321, 326 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1999). An agency’s declarations are accorded “a presumption of good faith, which cannot\n\nbe rebutted by purely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of other\n\ndocuments.” SafeCard, 926 F.2d at 1200 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); see\n\nalso id. at 1201 (“Mere speculation that as yet uncovered documents may exist does not\n\nundermine the finding that the agency conducted a reasonable search for them.”). An affiant\n\nwho is in charge of coordinating an agency’s document search efforts in response to a plaintiff=s\n\nFOIA request is the most appropriate person to provide a comprehensive affidavit in FOIA\n\nlitigation. Id. at 1201. Declarations that contain hearsay in recounting searches for documents\n\nare generally acceptable. Kay v. FCC, 976 F. Supp. 23, 34 n.29 (D.D.C. 1997), aff’d, 172 F.3d\n\n919 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (Table). Once an agency has provided adequate affidavits, the burden\n\nshifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate a lack of a good faith search. See Maynard v. CIA, 986\n\nF.2d 547, 560 (1st Cir. 1993). If a review of the record raises substantial doubt as to the\n\nreasonableness of the search, especially in light of “well-defined requests and positive\n\nindications of overlooked materials,” then summary judgment may be inappropriate. Founding\n\nChurch of Scientology v. NSA, 610 F.2d 824, 837 (D.C. Cir. 1979).\n\n               FOIA “was not intended to reduce government agencies to full-time investigators\n\non behalf of requesters.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Export-Import Bank, 108 F. Supp. 2d 19, 27\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f(D.D.C. 2000) (quoting Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. Dep’t of Commerce, 907 F.2d 203, 209\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1990)). As such, agencies are not required to “organize documents to facilitate FOIA\n\nresponses.” Goulding v. IRS, Civ. No. 97-C-5628, 1998 WL 325202, at *5 (N.D. Ill. June 8,\n\n1998) (citing NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 162); see also Blakey v. Dep’t of\n\nJustice, 549 F. Supp. 362, 366-67 (D.D.C. 1982) (“FOIA was not intended to compel agencies to\n\nbecome ad hoc investigators for requesters whose requests are not compatible with their own\n\ninformation retrieval systems.”), aff’d, 720 F.2d 215 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Table). In addition, FOIA\n\ndoes not require agencies to create or retain documents. Moore v. Bush, 601 F. Supp. 2d 6, 15\n\n(D.D.C. 2009). Further, an agency is not required to undertake a search that is so broad as to be\n\nunduly burdensome. Nation Magazine v. Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885, 891 (D.C. Cir. 1995).\n\n“[I]t is the requester’s responsibility to frame requests with sufficient particularity . . . .” Judicial\n\nWatch, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 27 (quoting Assassination Archives and Research Ctr. v. CIA, 720 F.\n\nSupp. 217, 219 (D.D.C. 1989)). An agency’s search must be evaluated in light of the request\n\nmade. The agency is “not obliged to look beyond the four corners of the request for leads to the\n\nlocation of responsive documents.” Kowalczyk v. Dep’t of Justice, 73 F.3d 386, 389 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n                B. Motion to Dismiss\n\n                The individual Defendants assert two bases for dismissing Mr. Cunningham’s suit\n\nagainst them. First, individual Defendants contend that Mr. Cunningham has failed to state a\n\nclaim under FOIA because that statute applies only to covered federal agencies.                 Second,\n\nDefendants assert that Mr. Cunningham’s alleged constitutional and statutory deprivations fail\n\nwithout regard to whether he is suing the individual Defendants in their official or personal\n\ncapacities. As to the former dismissal argument, individual Defendants reason that the Court\n\n\n\n                                                   12\n\flacks subject matter jurisdiction, and as to the latter, individual Defendants argue that Mr.\n\nCunningham fails to state a claim.\n\n               1. Failure to State a Claim\n\n               The individual Defendants argue that Mr. Cunningham has failed to state a claim\n\nas to them under FOIA, the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and CVRA. A motion to\n\ndismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the adequacy of a complaint\n\non its face. Even though pro se complaints are construed liberally, see Haines v. Kerner, 404\n\nU.S. 519, 520 (1972); United States v. Byfield, 391 F.3d 277, 281 (D.C. Cir. 2004), the complaint\n\nmust still be sufficient to “give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds\n\nupon which it rests.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n               While a complaint does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff’s\n\nobligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief “requires more than labels and\n\nconclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Id. To\n\nsurvive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim\n\nfor relief that is “plausible on its face.” Id. at 570. A court must treat the complaint’s factual\n\nallegations as true, “even if doubtful in fact.” Id. at 555. Yet, a court need not accept as true\n\nlegal conclusions set forth in the complaint. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). In\n\ndeciding a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), a court may consider the facts alleged in the complaint,\n\ndocuments attached to the complaint as exhibits or incorporated by reference, and matters about\n\nwhich the court may take judicial notice. Abhe & Svoboda, Inc. v. Chao, 508 F.3d 1052, 1059\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2007).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f               2. Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n               The individual Defendants also assert that the Court lacks jurisdiction because\n\nMr. Cunningham’s claims cannot be brought against the individual Defendants in their official\n\ncapacities.   Just as liberally-construed pro se complaints must satisfy Rule 12(b)(6), such\n\npleadings must also state a basis for subject matter jurisdiction. “[B]ecause subject-matter\n\njurisdiction is ‘an Art. III as well as a statutory requirement . . . no action of the parties can\n\nconfer subject-matter jurisdiction upon a federal court.’” Akinseye v. District of Columbia, 339\n\nF.3d 970, 971 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de\n\nGuinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982)).\n\n               Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint, or any\n\nportion thereof, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. When reviewing a motion to dismiss for\n\nlack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), a court must review the complaint liberally, granting the\n\n“‘plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.’” Barr v.\n\nClinton, 370 F.3d 1196, 1199 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting Kowal v. MCI Commc’ns Corp., 16 F.3d\n\n1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). Nevertheless, the party asserting subject matter jurisdiction has\n\nthe burden of demonstrating that such jurisdiction exists. Khadr v. United States, 529 F.3d 1112,\n\n1115 (D.C. Cir. 2008); see Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994)\n\n(noting that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and “[i]t is to be presumed that a\n\ncause lies outside this limited jurisdiction, and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon\n\nthe party asserting jurisdiction.” (internal citations omitted)).    Furthermore, the court may\n\nconsider materials outside the pleadings, Settles v. Parole Comm’n, 429 F.3d 1098, 1107 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2005), and it “need not accept factual inferences drawn by plaintiffs if those inferences are\n\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\fnot supported by facts alleged in the complaint, nor must the Court accept plaintiffs’ legal\n\nconclusions,” Speelman v. United States, 461 F. Supp. 2d 71, 73 (D.D.C. 2006).\n\n               C. Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n               The claims against the federal agencies (DOJ, EOUSA, and the FBI) are limited\n\nto alleged violations of FOIA. The agency Defendants contend that there is no genuine dispute\n\nas to any material fact and that they are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). Summary\n\njudgment is properly granted against a party who “after adequate time for discovery and upon\n\nmotion . . . fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to\n\nthat party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court must\n\ndraw all justifiable inferences in the nonmoving party’s favor and accept the nonmoving party’s\n\nevidence as true. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. A nonmoving party, however, must establish more\n\nthan “[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence” in support of its position. Id. at 252.\n\n               FOIA cases are typically and appropriately decided on motions for summary\n\njudgment. Miscavige v. IRS, 2 F.3d 366, 368 (11th Cir. 1993); Rushford v. Civiletti, 485 F.\n\nSupp. 477, 481 n.13 (D.D.C. 1980), aff’d, Rushford v. Smith, 656 F.2d 900 (D.C. Cir. 1981). In\n\na FOIA case, a court may award summary judgment solely on the basis of information provided\n\nby the department or agency in affidavits or declarations when the affidavits or declarations\n\ndescribe “the documents and the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail,\n\ndemonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and are\n\nnot controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.”\n\nMilitary Audit Project v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1981); see also Vaughn v. Rosen,\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f484 F.2d 820, 826–28 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (requiring agencies to prepare an itemized index\n\ncorrelating each withheld document, or portion thereof, with a specific FOIA exemption and the\n\nrelevant part of the agency’s nondisclosure justification). An agency must demonstrate that\n\n“each document that falls within the class requested either has been produced, is unidentifiable,\n\nor is wholly [or partially] exempt” from FOIA’s requirements. Goland v. CIA, 607 F.2d 339,\n\n352 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n                                        III. ANALYSIS\n\n               A. FOIA Claims Against Individually-Named Defendants\n\n               Mr. Cunningham’s FOIA suit against the individual Defendants cannot possibly\n\nprevail. 12 FOIA relief may only be obtained from covered federal agencies. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(B) (granting courts “jurisdiction to enjoin [an] agency from withholding agency\n\nrecords”).   An “agency” is “any executive department, military department, Government\n\ncorporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch\n\nof the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent\n\nregulatory agency.” Id. § 552(f)(1); see also id. § 105 (defining “Executive agency” as “an\n\nExecutive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment”). Thus, in\n\nFOIA cases, individual federal employees are not proper parties; only agencies in the executive\n\nbranch of the Government. Id. § 552(f)(1); see also Martinez v. Bureau of Prisons, 444 F.3d\n\n12\n   Defendants argue that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendants AUSA Bober,\nAUSA Kennedy, SA Norris, Deputy Marshal Ricigliano, and Judge Sand, who all work and\nreside in the New York area. Def.’s Mem. at 18-21. The Court agrees that the District of\nColumbia’s long-arm statute is inapplicable to these Defendants and that they lack the requisite\nminimum contacts to warrant the Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over them. See Int’l\nShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945); World Wide Minerals, Ltd. v. Republic of\nKazakhstan, 296 F.3d 1154, 1168 (D.C. Cir. 2002); D.C. Code § 13-423(a). In addition, the\nCourt lacks personal jurisdiction over the “Reliable Confidential Informant,” who is otherwise\nunidentified but apparently prompted the search of Mr. Cunningham’s home in New York. All\nclaims against these Defendants will be dismissed without prejudice.\n                                               16\n\f620, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Summary judgment in favor of the remaining individual Defendants\n\nmust be granted on Mr. Cunningham’s FOIA claims against them.\n\n              B. Constitutional and Statutory Claims Against Individually-Named Defendants\n\n              Mr. Cunningham alleges that the individual Defendants acted in contravention of\n\ncertain constitutional and statutory provisions. It is unclear whether Mr. Cunningham intends to\n\nname the individual Defendants in their official or personal capacities. In light of the Court’s\n\nobligation to construe Mr. Cunningham’s pleadings liberally, see Haines, 404 U.S. at 520;\n\nByfield, 391 F.3d at 281, it will assume that he intended to sue them in both capacities.\n\nNonetheless, for the reasons discussed below, summary judgment on such claims must be\n\ngranted to the individual Defendants.\n\n              1. Individual Defendants Named in Their Official Capacities\n\n              It is a bedrock principle of American law that, as sovereign, the United States is\n\nimmune from suit unless Congress has expressly waived that immunity. See, e.g., Block v. North\n\nDakota ex. rel. Bd. of Univ. & School Lands, 461 U.S. 273, 287 (1983) (“The basic rule of\n\nfederal sovereign immunity is that the United States cannot be sued at all without the consent of\n\nCongress.”). The United States’ exemption from suit is expressed in jurisdictional terms––that\n\nis, federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over suits against the United States in the\n\nabsence of a waiver. See, e.g., Jackson v. Bush, 448 F. Supp. 2d 198, 200 (D.D.C. 2006) (“[A]\n\nplaintiff must overcome the defense of sovereign immunity in order to establish the jurisdiction\n\nnecessary to survive a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.”). Waivers of sovereign immunity are\n\nstrictly construed, and any doubt or ambiguity is resolved in favor of immunity. Lane v. Pena,\n\n518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996) (“A waiver of the Federal Government’s sovereign immunity must be\n\nunequivocally expressed in statutory text, and will not be implied. Moreover, a waiver of the\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\fGovernment’s sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the\n\nsovereign.” (internal citations omitted)).   Claims against federal employees in their official\n\ncapacities are deemed to be claims against the United States. See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S.\n\n159, 165-66 (1985). To the extent that Mr. Cunningham has sued the individual Defendants in\n\ntheir official capacities, he has failed to state a valid waiver of sovereign immunity. As a result,\n\nthe Court has no subject matter jurisdiction and will dismiss his claims for damages against the\n\nindividual Defendants.\n\n               2. Individual Defendants Named in Their Individual Capacities\n\n               Mr. Cunningham argues that the individual Defendants violated his rights under\n\nCVRA and the U.S. Constitution. The Court will address the statutory claim first.\n\n               No judicial relief may be had under CVRA because that statute does not allow a\n\nprivate party to sue for enforcement. CVRA expressly disallows a suit for damages against the\n\nfederal government or its officials, see 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6), and Mr. Cunningham has failed\n\nto carry his “heavy burden” of demonstrating the requisite congressional intent necessary to\n\nestablish an implied private right of action, see Samuels v. District of Columbia, 770 F.2d 184,\n\n194 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Moreover, before the statute is available for recompense, the victim of a\n\ncrime must establish that an official charging instrument was issued, or a conviction was\n\nobtained, against the perpetrator of the crime. Compare Searcy v. Paletz, Civil Action No. 7:07-\n\n1389, 2007 WL 1875802, at *5 (D.S.C. June 27, 2007) (“[T]he CVRA does not grant victims\n\nany rights against individuals who have not been convicted of a crime.” (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)), with United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 326 (E.D.N.Y.\n\n2005) (interpreting the definition of “victim” in CVRA to include “any person who would be\n\nconsidered a ‘crime victim’ if the government were to establish the truth of the factual\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\fallegations in its charging instrument.”). Here, none of the individual Defendants has been\n\ncriminally charged or convicted for acts or omissions associated with the alleged concealment or\n\ndestruction of records relating to Mr. Cunningham’s FOIA requests for records concerning his\n\nstatus as a federal crime victim, which is the gravamen of this action. (Again, the specifics of the\n\nsearch and Mr. Cunningham’s alleged injuries already have been litigated in New York.)\n\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss Mr. Cunningham’s CVRA allegations for failure to state a\n\nclaim.\n\n               Mr. Cunningham’s allegations that individual Defendants violated his First, Fifth,\n\nand Fourteenth Amendment rights also are unsound. Although not articulated as such, Mr.\n\nCunningham’s claims are covered by Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau\n\nof Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). 13 Bivens allowed personal lawsuits for money damages\n\nagainst federal officials who violate known constitutional rights. Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko,\n\n534 U.S. 61, 66 (2001); see also Thompson v. Pope, 397 F. Supp. 2d 28, 32 (D.D.C. 2005). Mr.\n\nCunningham claims that the individual Defendants’ failures to produce records concerning his\n\n\n\n\n13\n   To the extent that the complaints attempted to raise a claim under the FTCA, 28 U.S.C.\n§§ 1346(b), 2671 et seq., the Court finds that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over such a\nclaim. Pursuant to FTCA, district courts have jurisdiction over torts allegedly committed by\nfederal employees. Sloan v. Dep’t of Housing & Urban Dev., 236 F.3d 756, 759 (D.C. Cir.\n2001). However, the statute requires initial presentation of any claim to the agency and bars a\nlawsuit until the administrative process is exhausted. McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106, 113\n(1993). The exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional, which means that a court cannot accept a\nlawsuit under FTCA until and unless the plaintiff first has attempted a resolution through the\nagency itself. Id.; 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a). Neither the Complaint nor the Amended Complaint\nalleges the necessary facts to demonstrate that Mr. Cunningham presented his claim to any of the\nagencies.\n\n\n                                                19\n\fcrime victim status in response to his FOIA requests constituted a constitutional deprivation for\n\nwhich he can recover money damages. 14\n\n               The scope of Bivens is narrowly construed.          See Malesko, 534 U.S. at 68\n\n(Supreme Court consistently has “refused to extend Bivens liability to any new context or new\n\ncategory of defendants”). There is no Bivens remedy available where a statute provides a\n\n“comprehensive system to administer public rights.” Spangola v. Mathis, 859 F.2d 223, 228\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc) (per curiam); see also Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367, 373, 389-90\n\n(1983) (Bivens remedies are inappropriate when Congress has itself created a remedy or\n\n“declar[ed] that existing statutes provide the exclusive mode of redress”). FOIA presents such a\n\nstatutory scheme. Johnson v. Exec. Office for Att’ys, 310 F.3d 771, 777 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\n\nTherefore, Bivens does not admit any damages remedy for an alleged violation of FOIA by the\n\nindividual Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n14\n    Inasmuch as Mr. Cunningham’s Bivens allegations are premised on the 2005 search of his\nhome or the denial of federal crime victim status to him, rather than FOIA, the Court finds that\nhe already has litigated those claims and cannot do so again. Mr. Cunningham received a final\njudgment on the merits denying relief on such claims in the Southern District of New York. See\nsupra pp. 1-3. The doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, prevents the court from hearing\n“repetitious suits involving the same cause of action once a court of competent jurisdiction has\nentered a final judgment on the merits.” United States v. Tohono O’Odham Nation, 131 S.Ct.\n1723, 1730 (2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Res judicata prevents the\nrelitigation of claims that were actually litigated in a prior suit and those that could have been\nlitigated but were not. Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980); see Drake v. FAA, 291 F.3d\n59, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (explaining that res judicata bars the relitigation of “issues that were or\ncould have been raised in [the prior] action.”) (emphasis in original) (quoting Allen, 449 U.S. at\n94). The res judicata analysis is unaffected by the fact that not all of the individual Defendants\nin this case were named in Mr. Cunningham’s prior lawsuits. See Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co.\nv. Adkins, 310 U.S. 381, 402 (1940) (explaining that “parties nominally different may be, in legal\neffect, the same” (quoting Chicago, Rock Island & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Schendel, 270 U.S. 611, 620\n(1926)). The Court finds that because the newly named parties are government officials, they are\nin privity with the parties to the former litigation. Id. at 402-03 (“[A] judgment in a suit between\na party and a representative of the United States is res judicata in relitigation of the same issue\nbetween that party and another officer of the government.”).\n                                                20\n\f              C. FOIA Claims Against Defendant Agencies\n\n              Finally, Mr. Cunningham complains that DOJ, EOUSA, and the FBI have\n\nviolated FOIA by performing inadequate searches for records that respond to his FOIA Request\n\nNos. 12-4031, 1206853, and 13-00146.\n\n              1. Scope of the Searches\n\n              EOUSA has shown that it conducted a reasonable search in response to FOIA\n\nRequest No. 12-4031, calculated to discover the requested documents. 15 SafeCard, 926 F.2d at\n\n1201; Meeropol, 790 F.2d at 950-51. At the direction of EOUSA, USAO-SDNY searched for\n\nresponsive records on October 16, 2012, via LIONS and PACER. A search of these databases\n\nwas not the end of the inquiry by USAO-SDNY but instead the starting point for locating\n\nrelevant records. Because only one month earlier USAO-SDNY had searched LIONS and\n\nPACER in connection with records concerning Mr. Cunningham’s FOIA Request No. 12-3595,\n\nUSAO-SDNY did not repeat that exercise for FOIA Request No. 12-4031. Rather, USAO-\n\nSDNY asked AUSA Kennedy and its Victim Witness Coordinator to search their files for\n\nrecords that might be responsive to FOIA Request No. 12-4031. Neither of these individuals\n\nlocated any responsive records.\n\n              EOUSA’s search for additional responsive records was adequate and reasonable\n\nfor the particular circumstances of this case. Truitt, 897 F.2d at 542. EOUSA was not required\n\nto search every record system. Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68. Mr. Cunningham’s bald assertions that\n\nEOUSA performed an inadequate search, Pl.’s Mot. in Support of Summ J. and Opp’n to Defs.’\n\n\n\n15\n  The Court further notes that Mr. Cunningham’s complaint against EOUSA relating to FOIA\nRequest No. 12-4031 is partially mooted. EOUSA has provided Mr. Cunningham with written\ndecisions concerning his federal crime victim status. See Compl., Ex. 1 [Dkt. 1-1]; Mot. to\nCompel, Ex. 1 [Dk. 7-1]. This disclosure moots the controversy as to these particular records.\nArmstrong, 97 F.3d at 582.\n                                             21\n\fMot. for Summ. J. or Mot. to Dismiss (Pl.’s MSJ and Opp’n) [Dkt. 28] at 2-3, are insufficient to\n\novercome the presumption of good faith that EOUSA has established through its declarations.\n\nSafeCard, 926 F.2d at 1200-01.\n\n              The Court also finds that the FBI, through its affidavits demonstrating its multiple\n\nsearch efforts of the relevant databases, has shown that the searches it conducted in response to\n\nFOIA Request No. 1206853 were reasonably calculated to discover the requested documents,\n\nSafeCard, 926 F.2d at 1201; Meeropol, 790 F.2d at 950-51. Before answering FOIA Request\n\nNo. 1206853, the FBI searched CRS for the terms: Benjamin Cunningham; Cunningham,\n\nBenjamin; Cunningham, B.; Federal Crim Victim Status Written Decision; Federal Crim Victim\n\nStatus Written; Federal Crim Victim Status; and Federal Crim Victim. Hardy Decl. ¶ 17. The\n\nFBI did not find any documents as a result of these searches. Id. After Mr. Cunningham filed\n\nsuit, the FBI conducted a second records search. The only differences between the first and\n\nsecond searches were that the FBI searched both main files and cross-references and spelled the\n\nentire word “crime” for the second search. Id. ¶ 19 & n.2. Again, no records were located. Id.\n\n¶ 19.\n\n              Mr. Cunningham again asserts conclusory claims concerning the inadequacy of\n\nthe FBI’s searches. Without further explanation, he alleges that “Defendants’ FOIA searches\n\nwere NOT sufficiently adequate under FOIA law thru [sic] the 5th & 14th Amendments under the\n\nprinciples of the United States Constitution” and that “Defendants have willfully REFUSED to\n\nprovide FOIA records,” including “Federal Crime Victim Intake/Interview Legal Documents”\n\nand “Federal Crime Victim Written Decision Legal Documents.” Pl.’s MSJ and Opp’n at 2-3.\n\nBut conclusory claims without an evidentiary basis do not carry a FOIA plaintiff’s burden of\n\nshowing that an agency’s search was not in good faith. Maynard, 986 F.2d at 560.\n\n\n\n                                               22\n\f               Further, Mr. Cunningham claims that SA Norris engaged in criminal conduct by\n\nfailing to enter her notes from a 2008 interview with Mr. Cunningham into FBI’s database of\n\nofficial agency records. Pl’s MSJ and Opp’n at 8; 24-33. Putting aside the fact that this claim\n\nappears to be outside the allegations made in either the Complaint or Amended Complaint, the\n\nCourt observes that SA Norris’s notes were personal, only to be used to refresh SA Norris’s\n\nmemory if necessary, and FBI agents have some degree of discretion as to what notes might be\n\nindexed in CRS. Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 16, 20. Because no charges or charging documents were ever\n\nfiled in relation to the 2005 search of Mr. Cunningham’s residence, the Court finds that the notes\n\nwere unofficial and the lack of indexing in CRS does not indicate a FOIA violation. Only\n\nagency records must be produced in response to a FOIA request. See Fortson v. Harvey, 407 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 13, 16 (D.D.C. 2005) (determining that, for purposes of FOIA, an Army investigator’s\n\nnotes did not constitute agency records because they “were for personal convenience”), appeal\n\ndismissed, Civil Action Nos. 05-5192, 05-5193, 2005 WL 3789167 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 1, 2005); 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(f)(2)(A).\n\n               Finally, with respect to FOIA Request No. 13-00146, the Court finds that OJP’s\n\nsearches for records response to that FOIA request were adequate and reasonable. OJP directed\n\nOVC to search its records for responsive documents. The OVC program manager searched for\n\nthe term “Cunningham” in the following storage locations: G: drive, an electronic system for\n\nmaintaining shared documents; H: drive, an electronic system accessible only to OVC staff and\n\nwhere staff store their personal documents and files; and “Chron files,” a paper system consisting\n\nof office correspondence ordered chronologically or by date of action. These searches resulted\n\nin locating a draft letter from former OVC Director (and current Defendant) Gillis to Mr.\n\nCunningham dated 2008. Lee Decl. ¶ 6. Thus prompted, OJP searched its Executive Secretariat\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\fCorrespondence Tracking System for the term “Benjamin Cunningham,” and located the control\n\nnumber assigned to Mr. Cunningham’s 2008 inquiry. OJP then manually retrieved the response\n\nletter from former OVC Director Gillis, Mr. Cunningham’s incoming letter, and the attachments\n\nfrom the 2008 paper files. Id. ¶ 7. No other responsive records were located. Id. ¶ 8. These\n\nwere all produced.\n\n               The Court finds that OJP has demonstrated that it made searches reasonably\n\ncalculated to discover documents responsive to FOIA Request No. 13-00146. SafeCard, 926\n\nF.2d at 1201; Meeropol, 790 F.2d at 950-51. Moreover, the systems of records OJP searched\n\nwere likely to possess the requested information. Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68. Here too, Mr.\n\nCunningham cannot avail himself of bare assertions that the OJP’s searches were insufficient.\n\nSee Pl.’s MSJ and Opp’n at 2-3. Such speculative claims cannot overcome the presumption of\n\ngood faith that agency’s enjoy upon submitting an adequate declaration. SafeCard, 926 F.2d at\n\n1200.\n\n               2. Segregability\n\n               If a record contains information that is exempt from disclosure, any reasonably\n\nsegregable information must be released after redacting the exempt portions, unless the non-\n\nexempt portions are inextricably intertwined with exempt portions. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b); see\n\nTrans-Pac. Policing Agreement v. Customs Serv., 177 F.3d 1022, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\nBecause EOUSA, FBI, and OJP produced in full all of the responsive documents that their\n\nsearches located, the Court thus finds that no segregable information has been withheld.\n\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               While the Court is mindful of its duty to construe pro se plaintiffs’ complaints\n\nliberally, see Haines, 404 U.S. at 520; Byfield, 391 F.3d at 281, for the reasons discussed above,\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\fthe Court will grant Defendants’ Motion [Dkt. 24] and close this case.

Mr. Cunningham appears pro se. He recently has filed a slew of\n\nmotions, see Dkt. Nos. 16, 19, 20, 26, 27, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, and 44, that seek to\n\nobtain summary judgment, compel various Defendants and other non-parties to produce records\n\nor affidavits, and sanction certain Defendants for perceived wrongdoing.          For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, the Court will dismiss this case and deny the motions as moot.\n\n                                            I. FACTS\n\n               A. Background\n\n               Mr. Cunningham is a repeat litigator, which gives the Court the advantage of\n\nknowing the origins of his claims. See, e.g., Cunningham v. O’Neill, Case No. 13-960(RMC),\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3753554</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C.

Because FOIA covers only agencies in the\nexecutive branch of government, 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1), the case was dismissed for failure to state\na claim.

In the process of their search, the Deputy Marshals handcuffed Mr.\n\nCunningham while looking for his fugitive brother. Still handcuffed, Mr. Cunningham fled his\n\nhome and ran into a bus carrying city transit officer-candidates.      Those officers held Mr.\n\nCunningham until the Deputy Marshals retrieved and, ultimately, released him.                See\n\nCunningham v. U.S. Congress House Ethics Comm., Civil Case No. 12-1935(RMC) (Compl.\n\n[Dkt. 1]). 2   Defendants state that no criminal charges were ever filed against any law\n\nenforcement officer(s) in connection with these events, Am. Mot. for Summ. J. (Def.’s Mem.)\n\n[Dkt. 24] at 2, a fact Mr. Cunningham does not contest. Mr. Cunningham’s subsequent efforts to\n\nbe designated a crime victim under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771,\n\nproved unsuccessful. Pl.’s Mot. to Compel, Ex. 1 [Dkt. 7-1] at 27. 3\n\n               Mr. Cunningham has brought at least three suits regarding these alleged events in\n\ntwo other jurisdictions. In the Southern District of New York, Mr. Cunningham sued the\n\nindividual Deputy Marshals and a New York Police Department detective for alleged Fourth and\n\nFifth Amendment violations, and, in a separate suit, he sought a writ of mandamus compelling\n\nthe Federal Crime Victim Office to provide him crime-victim benefits and counseling, to pay his\n\nmedical bills related to injuries he sustained on the day his home was searched, and to reimburse\n\nhim for cash allegedly taken during the 2005 search of his home. The former suit was dismissed\n\nin favor of the defendants on summary judgment and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second\n\nCircuit dismissed the ensuing appeal as frivolous. See Cunningham v. McCluskey, Civil Action\n\n2\n  In U.S. Congress House Ethics Comm., Mr. Cunningham sued U.S. Representative José\nSerrano and the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ethics. The case was dismissed\nbecause congressional members and committees are immune from suit for official duties under\nthe Speech or Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution. See Civil Case No. 12-1935(RMC)\n(D.D.C. Feb. 14, 2013) (Order [Dkt. 5] at 2-3); U.S. Const. art.

Mr. Cunningham’s FOIA Requests\n\n              Mr. Cunningham now has turned to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in an\n\nattempt to locate documents to prove his claims. In 2012, Mr. Cunningham filed FOIA Requests\n\nNos. 12-3595, 12-4031, 1206853, and 13-00146. All of these requests pertained either to the\n\n2005 search of his home or the refusal to designate Mr. Cunningham a crime victim.\n\n              1. FOIA Request No. 12-3595\n\n              On July 26, 2012, Mr. Cunningham sent a FOIA request to the Department of\n\nJustice’s (DOJ) Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA) asking for a copy of its “written\n\ndecision . . . concerning [Mr. Cunningham’s] pro-se filed Misconduct Complaint” against\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fAssistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) Peter M. Skinner, who defended USMS in McCluskey. See\n\nDefs.’ Ex. 9 (Luczynski Decl.) [Dkt. 21-9] ¶ 4; Luczynski Decl., Ex. A [Dkt. 21-10]. EOUSA\n\ndesignated the request as FOIA Request No. 12-3595 and directed the U.S. Attorney’s Office for\n\nthe Southern District of New York (USAO-SDNY) to perform a search for responsive records.\n\nLuczynski Decl. ¶ 5; Defs.’ Ex. 11 (Smith Decl.) [Dkt. 21-11] ¶ 5. USAO-SDNY searched the\n\nLegal Information Office Network System (LIONS), which indicates whether a case is open or\n\nclosed and whom to contact concerning the identification of responsive records, and the Public\n\nAccess to Court Electronic Records (PACER), which provides additional case information.\n\nSmith Decl. ¶¶ 2, 5. USAO-SDNY then sent an email to AUSA David Kennedy, Chief of the\n\nCivil Rights Unit at USAO-SDNY, requesting all records pertaining to Mr. Cunningham. On\n\nOctober 1, 2012, USAO-SDNY reviewed, compiled and sent responsive records to EOUSA. Id.\n\n¶¶ 5-6. On October 24, 2012, EOUSA released to Mr. Cunningham 33 pages in full and\n\nwithheld four pages under FOIA Exemption (b)(5). 4 Luczynski Decl. ¶ 5. EOUSA also notified\n\nMr. Cunningham that its review had located potentially responsive records that originated from\n\nUSMS, the DOJ Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Department of Health and Human\n\nServices (HHS), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). It stated that the additional\n\nrecords had been referred to these entities, which would respond directly to Mr. Cunningham.\n\nId.; Luczynski Decl., Ex.

With respect to USMS, it appears that the Amended Complaint has\nattempted to sue eleven individuals––Defendants O’Neill, Gillis, Turman, O’Rourke, Kennedy,\nBober, Ricigliano, Does, Norris, Sand, an unnamed confidential informant, and Serrano––for\nalleged deficiencies in the records production by USMS. See infra p. 7-9.\n                                                4\n\f               2. FOIA Request No. 12-4031\n\n               On August 10, 2012, Mr. Cunningham sent a complaint to the FBI. Luczynski\n\nDecl. ¶ 6. It stated that Marie O’Rourke of the Federal Crime Victims Ombudsman Office,\n\nAUSA Kennedy, and FBI Special Agent (SA) Kristina Norris had “refused to provide their\n\nwritten decision concerning [Mr. Cunningham’s] federal crime victim status.” Luczynski Decl.,\n\nEx. C [Dkt. 21-10]. The FBI treated the letter as a FOIA request and forwarded it to EOUSA on\n\nSeptember 26, 2012. On that date, Mr. Cunningham asked EOUSA to expedite the request.\n\nLuczynski Decl. ¶¶ 6-7; Luczynski Decl., Ex. D [Dkt. 21-10].          Two weeks later, EOUSA\n\nassigned number 12-4031 to Mr. Cunningham’s August 10, 2012, complaint letter (FOIA\n\nRequest No. 12-4031) and informed Mr. Cunningham that it would not expedite his request but\n\ninstead process it in the order it was received. Luczynski Decl. ¶ 8; Luczynski Decl., Ex. E [Dkt.\n\n21-10].\n\n               On October 16, 2012, EOUSA directed USAO-SDNY to perform a search for\n\nrecords responsive to FOIA Request 12-4031. Smith Decl. ¶ 4; Smith Decl., Ex. A [Dkt. 21-\n\n12]. Because USAO-SDNY recently had performed a search in connection with FOIA Request\n\nNo. 12-3595, USAO-SDNY asked only AUSA Kennedy and its Victim Witness Coordinator to\n\nsearch for records concerning Mr. Cunningham and his status as a federal crime victim. Neither\n\nAUSA Kennedy nor the Victim Witness Coordinator located any responsive records. Smith\n\nDecl. ¶ 7. EOUSA subsequently informed Mr. Cunningham on November 8, 2012, that its\n\nsearch pertaining to FOIA Request No. 12-4031 had not revealed any responsive records.\n\nLuczynski Decl. ¶ 9; Luczynski Decl., Ex. F [Dkt. 21-10].\n\n               Mr. Cunningham appealed this response to the Office of Information Policy\n\n(OIP), which oversees agency compliance with FOIA. On December 21, 2012, OIP affirmed\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fEOUSA’s handling and conclusion on FOIA Request No. 12-4031. Luczynski Decl. ¶¶ 10-12.\n\nIt again told Mr. Cunningham that EOUSA “could not locate records responsive to his request”\n\nand concluded that EOUSA’s search was “adequate” and “reasonable.” Luczynski Decl., Ex. I\n\n[Dkt. 21-10].\n\n                3. FOIA Request No. 1206853\n\n                On December 5, 2012, Mr. Cunningham wrote again to the FBI, this time asking\n\nfor a copy of his “Federal Crime Victim Status Written Decision.” Defs.’ Ex. 13 (Hardy Decl.)\n\n[Dkt. 21-13] ¶ 5; Hardy Decl., Ex. A [Dkt. 21-14]. The FBI designated this request FOIA\n\nRequest No. 1206853 on January 29, 2013. The FBI searched the indices of its Central Records\n\nSystem (CRS) for responsive records and coordinated additional searches by the Office for\n\nVictim Assistance (OVA) and SA Norris. Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 6, 17-20; Hardy Decl., Ex. B [Dkt. 21-\n\n14]. CRS is the FBI’s electronic repository for information compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes as well as administrative, applicant, criminal, personnel, and other files. Hardy Decl.\n\n¶ 11. It is accessed via General Indices and an Automated Case Support System (ACS), which\n\nconsists of Investigative Case Management, Electronic Case File, and a Universal Index, by\n\nsearching for the subject. Id. ¶¶ 11-15.\n\n                On February 1, 2013, the FBI informed Mr. Cunningham that it had not located\n\nany records responsive to FOIA Request No. 1206853. Hardy Decl. ¶ 7; Hardy Decl., Ex. C\n\n[Dkt. 21-14]. Mr. Cunningham appealed to OIP on February 6, 2013, but OIP closed the case\n\nafter Mr. Cunningham filed the instant suit. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.9(a)(3). See also Hardy Decl. ¶¶\n\n8-9; Hardy Decl., Ex. D [Dkt. 21-14]; Hardy Decl. Ex., E [Dkt. 21-14]; Hardy Decl., Ex.

FOIA Request No. 13-00146\n\n               Mr. Cunningham’s last FOIA request before this Court was sent to the DOJ’s\n\nOffice of Justice Programs (OJP) on January 23, 2013. He requested “all documents [concerning\n\nhis status as a federal crime victim] and a copy of [his] Federal Crime Victim Status Written\n\nDecision.” Defs.’ Ex. 15 (Lee Decl.) [Dkt. 21-15] ¶ 3; Lee Decl., Ex. A [Dkt. 21-16]. OJP\n\nassigned number 13-00146 (FOIA Request No. 13-00146) to Mr. Cunningham’s January 23\n\nrequest and directed the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) to conduct a search for responsive\n\nrecords. Lee Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5. Ultimately, both OJP and OVC conducted searches that located 50\n\npages of responsive material. Lee Decl. ¶¶ 5-8. On March 1, 2013, OJP produced the 50 pages\n\nin full to Mr. Cunningham. Id. ¶ 9; Lee Decl., Ex. F [Dkt. 21-21]. OJP realized on May 30,\n\n2013, that it had omitted two responsive documents, consisting of three pages, from its March 1,\n\n2013 production to Mr. Cunningham. It produced these pages in full on June 3, 2013. Lee Decl.\n\n¶ 10, Lee Decl., Ex. G [Dkt. 21-22].\n\n               C. The Instant Litigation\n\n               Mr. Cunningham seeks to compel the release of records concerning the decision\n\nto deny him federal crime victim status. Compl. [Dkt. 1] at 14. In his initial Complaint filed on\n\nFebruary 12, 2013, Mr. Cunningham named Representative Serrano, DOJ, the FBI and EOUSA. 6\n\nId. at 1-2. He claimed that Representative Serrano and employees of DOJ, the FBI, and EOUSA\n\n“[w]illfully CONCEAL[ED]” records relating to his request for federal crime victim status. Id.\n\nat 4.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Mr. Cunningham named USAO-SDNY, not EOUSA, but the Court has substituted EOUSA\nbecause it is the executive office for all of the Offices of the U.S. Attorneys and is the proper\ndefendant.\n                                                7\n\f               On March 20, 2013, Mr. Cunningham filed an Amended Complaint, seeking $5\n\nmillion in damages. 7 See Civil Cover Sheet [Dkt. 1-2] at 2. Renewing his FOIA request for\n\ndocuments pertaining to the denial of his federal crime victim status, he named eleven\n\nindividuals as co-Defendants: (1) Sean R. O’Neill, Chief of the Administrative Appeals Staff at\n\nOIP; (2) John W. Gillis, former Director of OVC; 8 (3) Kathryn Turman, Program Director of\n\nOVA; 9 (4) Marie A.

After Mr.\n\nCunningham filed suit, the FBI conducted a customary second search, in accordance with its\n\npolicy. Def.’s Mem. at 12-13. The only differences between the searches were that in the\n\nsecond search the FBI searched both main files and cross-references and spelled the entire word\n\n“crime.” Hardly Decl. ¶ 19 & n.2.

FOIA\n\n              FOIA requires federal agencies to release government records to the public upon\n\nrequest, subject to nine listed exceptions. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b); Wolf v.

The Court did not issue another Fox-\nNeal Order because it determined that the differences between Defendants’ original and amended\nMemoranda were the result of scrivener’s error.\n                                               9\n\fThat means that FOIA is remedied by ordering the production of agency records without money\n\ndamages.

Cir. 1996) (finding FOIA only calls for releasing records to a complainant, not publishing\n\nthe records in the Federal Register). Once requested records are produced, there is no longer a\n\ncase or controversy, and the FOIA action becomes moot. See Armstrong v. Exec.

Military Audit Project, 656 F.2d at\n\n738.

First, individual Defendants contend that Mr. Cunningham has failed to state a\n\nclaim under FOIA because that statute applies only to covered federal agencies.

FOIA Claims Against Individually-Named Defendants\n\n               Mr. Cunningham’s FOIA suit against the individual Defendants cannot possibly\n\nprevail. 12 FOIA relief may only be obtained from covered federal agencies. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(B) (granting courts “jurisdiction to enjoin [an] agency from withholding agency\n\nrecords”).   An “agency” is “any executive department, military department, Government\n\ncorporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch\n\nof the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent\n\nregulatory agency.” Id. § 552(f)(1); see also id. § 105 (defining “Executive agency” as “an\n\nExecutive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment”). Thus, in\n\nFOIA cases, individual federal employees are not proper parties; only agencies in the executive\n\nbranch of the Government. Id. § 552(f)(1); see also Martinez v. Bureau of Prisons, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">12</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendants AUSA Bober,\nAUSA Kennedy, SA Norris, Deputy Marshal Ricigliano, and Judge Sand, who all work and\nreside in the New York area.

The Court agrees that the District of\nColumbia’s long-arm statute is inapplicable to these Defendants and that they lack the requisite\nminimum contacts to warrant the Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over them.

In addition, the\nCourt lacks personal jurisdiction over the “Reliable Confidential Informant,” who is otherwise\nunidentified but apparently prompted the search of Mr. Cunningham’s home in New York. All\nclaims against these Defendants will be dismissed without prejudice.\n                                               16\n\f620, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Summary judgment in favor of the remaining individual Defendants\n\nmust be granted on Mr. Cunningham’s FOIA claims against them.\n\n              B. Constitutional and Statutory Claims Against Individually-Named Defendants\n\n              Mr. Cunningham alleges that the individual Defendants acted in contravention of\n\ncertain constitutional and statutory provisions. It is unclear whether Mr. Cunningham intends to\n\nname the individual Defendants in their official or personal capacities. In light of the Court’s\n\nobligation to construe Mr. Cunningham’s pleadings liberally, see Haines, 404 U.S. at 520;\n\nByfield, 391 F.3d at 281, it will assume that he intended to sue them in both capacities.\n\nNonetheless, for the reasons discussed below, summary judgment on such claims must be\n\ngranted to the individual Defendants.\n\n              1. Individual Defendants Named in Their Official Capacities\n\n              It is a bedrock principle of American law that, as sovereign, the United States is\n\nimmune from suit unless Congress has expressly waived that immunity. See, e.g., Block v. North\n\nDakota ex. rel. Bd. of Univ. & School Lands, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110923\"><a href=\"/opinion/110923/block-v-north-dakota-ex-rel-board-of-univ-and-school-lands/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 287 (1983) (“The basic rule of\n\nfederal sovereign immunity is that the United States cannot be sued at all without the consent of\n\nCongress.”). The United States’ exemption from suit is expressed in jurisdictional terms––that\n\nis, federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over suits against the United States in the\n\nabsence of a waiver. See, e.g., Jackson v. Bush, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2396089\"><a href=\"/opinion/2396089/jackson-v-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200 (D.D.C. 2006) (“[A]\n\nplaintiff must overcome the defense of sovereign immunity in order to establish the jurisdiction\n\nnecessary to survive a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.”). Waivers of sovereign immunity are\n\nstrictly construed, and any doubt or ambiguity is resolved in favor of immunity. Lane v. Pena,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118049\"><a href=\"/opinion/118049/lane-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192 (1996) (“A waiver of the Federal Government’s sovereign immunity must be\n\nunequivocally expressed in statutory text, and will not be implied. Moreover, a waiver of the\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\fGovernment’s sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the\n\nsovereign.” (internal citations omitted)).   Claims against federal employees in their official\n\ncapacities are deemed to be claims against the United States. See Kentucky v. Graham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111500\"><a href=\"/opinion/111500/kentucky-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 165-66 (1985). To the extent that Mr. Cunningham has sued the individual Defendants in\n\ntheir official capacities, he has failed to state a valid waiver of sovereign immunity. As a result,\n\nthe Court has no subject matter jurisdiction and will dismiss his claims for damages against the\n\nindividual Defendants.\n\n               2. Individual Defendants Named in Their Individual Capacities\n\n               Mr. Cunningham argues that the individual Defendants violated his rights under\n\nCVRA and the U.S. Constitution. The Court will address the statutory claim first.\n\n               No judicial relief may be had under CVRA because that statute does not allow a\n\nprivate party to sue for enforcement. CVRA expressly disallows a suit for damages against the\n\nfederal government or its officials, see 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6), and Mr. Cunningham has failed\n\nto carry his “heavy burden” of demonstrating the requisite congressional intent necessary to\n\nestablish an implied private right of action, see Samuels v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457041\"><a href=\"/opinion/457041/eunice-samuels-lorraine-warren-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">770</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n194 (D.C.

Moreover, before the statute is available for recompense, the victim of a\n\ncrime must establish that an official charging instrument was issued, or a conviction was\n\nobtained, against the perpetrator of the crime.

Here, none of the individual Defendants has been\n\ncriminally charged or convicted for acts or omissions associated with the alleged concealment or\n\ndestruction of records relating to Mr. Cunningham’s FOIA requests for records concerning his\n\nstatus as a federal crime victim, which is the gravamen of this action. (Again, the specifics of the\n\nsearch and Mr. Cunningham’s alleged injuries already have been litigated in New York.)\n\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss Mr. Cunningham’s CVRA allegations for failure to state a\n\nclaim.\n\n               Mr. Cunningham’s allegations that individual Defendants violated his First, Fifth,\n\nand Fourteenth Amendment rights also are unsound. Although not articulated as such, Mr.\n\nCunningham’s claims are covered by Bivens v.

Mr.\n\nCunningham claims that the individual Defendants’ failures to produce records concerning his\n\n\n\n\n13\n   To the extent that the complaints attempted to raise a claim under the FTCA, 28 U.S.C.\n§§ 1346(b), 2671 et seq., the Court finds that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over such a\nclaim. Pursuant to FTCA, district courts have jurisdiction over torts allegedly committed by\nfederal employees. Sloan v.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112858\"><a href=\"/opinion/112858/mcneil-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113\n(1993). The exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional, which means that a court cannot accept a\nlawsuit under FTCA until and unless the plaintiff first has attempted a resolution through the\nagency itself. Id.; 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a). Neither the Complaint nor the Amended Complaint\nalleges the necessary facts to demonstrate that Mr. Cunningham presented his claim to any of the\nagencies.\n\n\n                                                19\n\fcrime victim status in response to his FOIA requests constituted a constitutional deprivation for\n\nwhich he can recover money damages. 14\n\n               The scope of Bivens is narrowly construed.          See Malesko, 534 U.S. at 68\n\n(Supreme Court consistently has “refused to extend Bivens liability to any new context or new\n\ncategory of defendants”). There is no Bivens remedy available where a statute provides a\n\n“comprehensive system to administer public rights.” Spangola v.

FOIA presents such a\n\nstatutory scheme. Johnson v. Exec.

Cir. 2002).\n\nTherefore, Bivens does not admit any damages remedy for an alleged violation of FOIA by the\n\nindividual Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n14\n    Inasmuch as Mr. Cunningham’s Bivens allegations are premised on the 2005 search of his\nhome or the denial of federal crime victim status to him, rather than FOIA, the Court finds that\nhe already has litigated those claims and cannot do so again. Mr. Cunningham received a final\njudgment on the merits denying relief on such claims in the Southern District of New York. See\nsupra pp. 1-3. The doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, prevents the court from hearing\n“repetitious suits involving the same cause of action once a court of competent jurisdiction has\nentered a final judgment on the merits.” United States v. Tohono O’Odham Nation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"215412\"><a href=\"/opinion/215412/united-states-v-tohono-oodham-nation/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Res judicata prevents the\nrelitigation of claims that were actually litigated in a prior suit and those that could have been\nlitigated but were not. Allen v.

The res judicata analysis is unaffected by the fact that not all of the individual Defendants\nin this case were named in Mr. Cunningham’s prior lawsuits. See Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co.\nv. Adkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103362\"><a href=\"/opinion/103362/sunshine-anthracite-coal-co-v-adkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 402 (1940) (explaining that “parties nominally different may be, in legal\neffect, the same” (quoting Chicago, Rock Island & Pac.

The Court finds that because the newly named parties are government officials, they are\nin privity with the parties to the former litigation. Id. at 402-03 (“[A] judgment in a suit between\na party and a representative of the United States is res judicata in relitigation of the same issue\nbetween that party and another officer of the government.”).\n                                                20\n\f              C. FOIA Claims Against Defendant Agencies\n\n              Finally, Mr. Cunningham complains that DOJ, EOUSA, and the FBI have\n\nviolated FOIA by performing inadequate searches for records that respond to his FOIA Request\n\nNos. 12-4031, 1206853, and 13-00146.\n\n              1. Scope of the Searches\n\n              EOUSA has shown that it conducted a reasonable search in response to FOIA\n\nRequest No. 12-4031, calculated to discover the requested documents. 15 SafeCard, 926 F.2d at\n\n1201; Meeropol, 790 F.2d at 950-51. At the direction of EOUSA, USAO-SDNY searched for\n\nresponsive records on October 16, 2012, via LIONS and PACER. A search of these databases\n\nwas not the end of the inquiry by USAO-SDNY but instead the starting point for locating\n\nrelevant records. Because only one month earlier USAO-SDNY had searched LIONS and\n\nPACER in connection with records concerning Mr. Cunningham’s FOIA Request No. 12-3595,\n\nUSAO-SDNY did not repeat that exercise for FOIA Request No. 12-4031. Rather, USAO-\n\nSDNY asked AUSA Kennedy and its Victim Witness Coordinator to search their files for\n\nrecords that might be responsive to FOIA Request No. 12-4031. Neither of these individuals\n\nlocated any responsive records.\n\n              EOUSA’s search for additional responsive records was adequate and reasonable\n\nfor the particular circumstances of this case. Truitt, 897 F.2d at 542. EOUSA was not required\n\nto search every record system. Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68. Mr. Cunningham’s bald assertions that\n\nEOUSA performed an inadequate search, Pl.’s Mot. in Support of Summ J. and Opp’n to Defs.’\n\n\n\n15\n  The Court further notes that Mr. Cunningham’s complaint against EOUSA relating to FOIA\nRequest No. 12-4031 is partially mooted. EOUSA has provided Mr. Cunningham with written\ndecisions concerning his federal crime victim status. See Compl., Ex. 1 [Dkt. 1-1]; Mot. to\nCompel, Ex. 1 [Dk. 7-1]. This disclosure moots the controversy as to these particular records.\nArmstrong, 97 F.3d at 582.\n                                             21\n\fMot. for Summ. J. or Mot. to Dismiss (Pl.’s MSJ and Opp’n) [Dkt. 28] at 2-3, are insufficient to\n\novercome the presumption of good faith that EOUSA has established through its declarations.\n\nSafeCard, 926 F.2d at 1200-01.\n\n              The Court also finds that the FBI, through its affidavits demonstrating its multiple\n\nsearch efforts of the relevant databases, has shown that the searches it conducted in response to\n\nFOIA Request No. 1206853 were reasonably calculated to discover the requested documents,\n\nSafeCard, 926 F.2d at 1201; Meeropol, 790 F.2d at 950-51. Before answering FOIA Request\n\nNo. 1206853, the FBI searched CRS for the terms: Benjamin Cunningham; Cunningham,\n\nBenjamin; Cunningham, B.; Federal Crim Victim Status Written Decision; Federal Crim Victim\n\nStatus Written; Federal Crim Victim Status; and Federal Crim Victim. Hardy Decl. ¶ 17. The\n\nFBI did not find any documents as a result of these searches. Id. After Mr. Cunningham filed\n\nsuit, the FBI conducted a second records search. The only differences between the first and\n\nsecond searches were that the FBI searched both main files and cross-references and spelled the\n\nentire word “crime” for the second search. Id. ¶ 19 & n.2. Again, no records were located. Id.\n\n¶ 19.\n\n              Mr. Cunningham again asserts conclusory claims concerning the inadequacy of\n\nthe FBI’s searches. Without further explanation, he alleges that “Defendants’ FOIA searches\n\nwere NOT sufficiently adequate under FOIA law thru [sic] the 5th & 14th Amendments under the\n\nprinciples of the United States Constitution” and that “Defendants have willfully REFUSED to\n\nprovide FOIA records,” including “Federal Crime Victim Intake/Interview Legal Documents”\n\nand “Federal Crime Victim Written Decision Legal Documents.” Pl.’s MSJ and Opp’n at 2-3.\n\nBut conclusory claims without an evidentiary basis do not carry a FOIA plaintiff’s burden of\n\nshowing that an agency’s search was not in good faith. Maynard, 986 F.2d at 560.\n\n\n\n                                               22\n\f               Further, Mr. Cunningham claims that SA Norris engaged in criminal conduct by\n\nfailing to enter her notes from a 2008 interview with Mr. Cunningham into FBI’s database of\n\nofficial agency records. Pl’s MSJ and Opp’n at 8; 24-33. Putting aside the fact that this claim\n\nappears to be outside the allegations made in either the Complaint or Amended Complaint, the\n\nCourt observes that SA Norris’s notes were personal, only to be used to refresh SA Norris’s\n\nmemory if necessary, and FBI agents have some degree of discretion as to what notes might be\n\nindexed in CRS. Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 16, 20. Because no charges or charging documents were ever\n\nfiled in relation to the 2005 search of Mr. Cunningham’s residence, the Court finds that the notes\n\nwere unofficial and the lack of indexing in CRS does not indicate a FOIA violation. Only\n\nagency records must be produced in response to a FOIA request. See Fortson v. Harvey, 407 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 13, 16 (D.D.C. 2005) (determining that, for purposes of FOIA, an Army investigator’s\n\nnotes did not constitute agency records because they “were for personal convenience”), appeal\n\ndismissed, Civil Action Nos. 05-5192, 05-5193, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3789167</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. Sept. 1, 2005); 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(f)(2)(A).\n\n               Finally, with respect to FOIA Request No. 13-00146, the Court finds that OJP’s\n\nsearches for records response to that FOIA request were adequate and reasonable. OJP directed\n\nOVC to search its records for responsive documents. The OVC program manager searched for\n\nthe term “Cunningham” in the following storage locations: G: drive, an electronic system for\n\nmaintaining shared documents; H: drive, an electronic system accessible only to OVC staff and\n\nwhere staff store their personal documents and files; and “Chron files,” a paper system consisting\n\nof office correspondence ordered chronologically or by date of action. These searches resulted\n\nin locating a draft letter from former OVC Director (and current Defendant) Gillis to Mr.\n\nCunningham dated 2008. Lee Decl. ¶ 6. Thus prompted, OJP searched its Executive Secretariat\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\fCorrespondence Tracking System for the term “Benjamin Cunningham,” and located the control\n\nnumber assigned to Mr. Cunningham’s 2008 inquiry. OJP then manually retrieved the response\n\nletter from former OVC Director Gillis, Mr. Cunningham’s incoming letter, and the attachments\n\nfrom the 2008 paper files. Id. ¶ 7. No other responsive records were located. Id. ¶ 8. These\n\nwere all produced.\n\n               The Court finds that OJP has demonstrated that it made searches reasonably\n\ncalculated to discover documents responsive to FOIA Request No. 13-00146. SafeCard, 926\n\nF.2d at 1201; Meeropol, 790 F.2d at 950-51. Moreover, the systems of records OJP searched\n\nwere likely to possess the requested information. Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68. Here too, Mr.\n\nCunningham cannot avail himself of bare assertions that the OJP’s searches were insufficient.\n\nSee Pl.’s MSJ and Opp’n at 2-3. Such speculative claims cannot overcome the presumption of\n\ngood faith that agency’s enjoy upon submitting an adequate declaration. SafeCard, 926 F.2d at\n\n1200.\n\n               2. Segregability\n\n               If a record contains information that is exempt from disclosure, any reasonably\n\nsegregable information must be released after redacting the exempt portions, unless the non-\n\nexempt portions are inextricably intertwined with exempt portions. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b); see\n\nTrans-Pac. Policing Agreement v. Customs Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184907\"><a href=\"/opinion/184907/trans-pac-policing-v-us-customs-svc/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\nBecause EOUSA, FBI, and OJP produced in full all of the responsive documents that their\n\nsearches located, the Court thus finds that no segregable information has been withheld.\n\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               While the Court is mindful of its duty to construe pro se plaintiffs’ complaints\n\nliberally, see Haines, 404 U.S. at 520; Byfield, 391 F.3d at 281, for the reasons discussed above,\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\fthe Court will grant Defendants’ Motion [Dkt. 24] and close this case.
