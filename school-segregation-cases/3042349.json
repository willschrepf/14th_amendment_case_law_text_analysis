Love,\nAssistant Attorney General, entered an appearance.\n\n   Before: BROWN and SRINIVASAN, Circuit Judges, and\nWILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\f                              2\n\n   Opinion for the Court filed by Senior Circuit Judge\nWILLIAMS.\n\n     WILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge: Kingman Park Civic\nAssociation exists to protect and enhance Kingman Park and\nthe surrounding neighborhood in Washington, D.C. It has\nsuccessfully applied to the District’s Historic Preservation\nReview Board to have the former Spingarn Senior High\nSchool designated a historic landmark. (The school was built\nin the mid-20th century for African American students, in one\nof the last gasps of de jure school segregation.) Next to\nSpingarn is Langston Terrace, a 13-acre public housing\ncomplex built in the 1930s as segregated housing for African\nAmericans.\n\n     Over the last several years the District of Columbia has\nstarted to develop a 2.2-mile streetcar line centered on this\nneighborhood. It entails a “Car Barn” on the Spingarn\ncampus in order to provide for storage and maintenance of the\nstreetcars, plus space for training. We treat the streetcar\nprogram and the Car Barn collectively as “the Project.”\n\n     The Association challenged the Project’s construction in\ndistrict court on a variety of grounds. In two Memorandum\nOpinions and Orders, the court rejected the claims in a medley\nof dismissals for failure to state a claim and summary\njudgment, both of which we review de novo. Kingman Park\nCivic Association v. Gray, 27 F. Supp. 3d 142 (D.D.C. 2014)\n(“Kingman Park I”); Kingman Park Civic Association v.\nGray, 27 F. Supp. 3d 171 (D.D.C. 2014) (“Kingman Park II”).\n\n    Three main challenges arise out of those rulings: (1) that\nthe District’s legislation (the “Wire Acts”) authorizing\nconstruction of the overhead wires to supply the streetcars\nwith power violated an 1888 federal statute; (2) that the D.C.\nDepartment of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs failed to\n\f                               3\n\nprepare an environmental impact statement (“EIS”), contrary\nto D.C. law; and (3) that the District’s pursuit of the Project\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment\nto the U.S. Constitution (made applicable to the District\nthrough the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment). We\naddress them in that order and affirm the judgment, though in\ncertain cases on different grounds from those of the district\ncourt.\n\n                            * * *\n\n     The Wire Acts. To allow the construction of aerial wires\nto supply the streetcars with power, the City Council passed\nthe “Wire Acts,” Transportation Infrastructure Emergency\nAmendment Act of 2010, D.C. Act 18-486; Transportation\nInfrastructure Congressional Review Emergency Act of 2010,\nD.C. Act 18-583; Transportation Infrastructure Amendment\nAct of 2010, D.C. Act 18-684 (codified at D.C. Code § 9-\n1171(a) (2012)), in effect overturning a 1888 statute barring\nthe District from authorizing “telegraph, telephone, electric\nlighting or other wires . . . on or over any of the [District’s]\nstreets or avenues.” 25 Stat. 323 (1888) (codified at D.C.\nCode § 34-1901.01 (2012)). The Association complained that\nthe Wire Acts violated the 1888 statute; their claim must\nsurmount the Home Rule Act, which grants the City Council\nbroad (but not unlimited) authority to pass laws governing the\nDistrict. D.C. Code §§ 1-201.02(a), 1-206.02(a) (2012). The\ndistrict court ruled that the Association did not have standing\nto challenge the District’s authorization of overhead wires.\nWe find standing, but reject the claim on the merits.\n\n     An association such as the plaintiff may establish\nstanding by showing either an injury to itself (“organizational\nstanding”), Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363,\n378 (1982), or a cognizable injury to one or more of its\nmembers, Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n,\n\f                               4\n\n432 U.S. 333, 342-43 (1977). The injury to members can\nestablish “associational standing” so long as the member\ninterests that the organization seeks to protect are germane to\nits purposes and neither the claim nor the relief requires the\nmembers’ participation. Id. The district court rejected both\ntheories, Kingman Park I, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 155-58; we\nconfine ourselves to associational standing, which we find to\nhave been established.\n\n     As the district court noted, two members of the\nAssociation (Murray and Wiggins) filed declarations saying\nthat the wires would “adversely affect the clear and\nunobstructed views” of the Spingarn High School and the\nLangston Terrace, thus detracting from the aesthetic and\nrecreational value of areas that their declarations say they use.\nKingman Park I, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 156. These assertions are\nuncontested, and we see no reason to doubt that the overhead\nwires would have the effects stated and qualify as a concrete\ninjury, traceable to the District’s actions and remediable by an\ninjunction against those actions. Vindication of the two\nmembers’ interests is germane to the purpose of the\nAssociation, which the complaint describes as seeking “to\npreserve and protect the historic buildings, scenic views,\nintegrity and environment within the District of Columbia and\nspecifically, the Kingman Park neighborhood.” Id. at 155.\nNo reason appears why the members’ participation in the\nlawsuit would be necessary. Associational standing thus\nexists for the challenge to the Wire Acts. As we will explain\nshortly, this reasoning also applies to standing on the EIS and\nequal protection issues.\n\n    On the merits of the Wire Acts claim, the Association\nmisreads the Home Rule Act. That Act prohibits legislation\nby the Council “to amend or repeal any Act of Congress . . .\nwhich is not restricted in its application exclusively in or to\nthe District,” D.C. Code § 1-206.02(a)(3) (2012); the 1888\n\f                              5\n\nstatute was “restricted” in exactly that way. Thus, especially\ntaking into account the Home Rule Act’s stated purpose—to\n“relieve Congress of the burden of legislating upon essentially\nlocal District matters,” D.C. Code § 1-201.02(a) (2012)—the\n1888 provision is no obstacle to the Wire Acts.\n\n     Environmental Impact Statement.          The Association\nclaims that the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory\nAffairs improperly failed to prepare an environmental impact\nstatement, in violation of the D.C. Environmental Policy Act,\nD.C. Code § 8-109.03(a) (2012). The Association identified a\nvariety of harms that it said the District had inadequately\nconsidered, including increased car traffic, electromagnetic\nradiation from the overhead wires, noise, dust and particle\npollution, and water pollution. The district court dismissed\nthe EIS claim, in almost all instances on the ground that the\nDepartment’s consideration of these issues, viewed in light of\nthe Association’s ill-substantiated assertions of more severe,\nunacknowledged harms, was not arbitrary, capricious, or an\nabuse of discretion, the undisputed standard of review.\nKingman Park II, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 178-83. See also D.C.\nCode § 2-510(a)(3)(A) (2012); In re A.T., 10 A.3d 127, 123-\n24 (D.C. 2010).\n\n     The parties agree that the Association has standing to\nraise the EIS issue (and also the equal protection issues\ndiscussed below).       Although the district court found\norganizational standing, Kingman Park II, 27 F. Supp. 3d at\n178-83, we think it simpler to rely on associational standing,\nin view of Association members’ declarations as to their\nresidence and use of the neighborhood and (in connection\nwith the equal protection claim) their being African American.\nAnd there is no more problem here with regard to the second\nand third requirements of Hunt than there was for the Wire\nActs claim.\n\f                               6\n\n      We uphold the district court’s dismissal of the EIS claim,\nbut in part on different grounds. We begin by noting that the\nAssociation’s EIS claim regarding electromagnetic radiation\nwas waived because it was not raised in its Amended\nComplaint. Kingman Park II, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 179. Among\nthe remaining arguments, we take here as an illustration the\nAssociation’s strongest argument—the assertion of serious\ntraffic impacts, particularly around the Spingarn site, where\nthe streetcars would be stored; the other arguments are no\nbetter. The district court mistakenly dismissed this claim on\nthe theory that the traffic impacts were only on the\n“community” and thus not covered by the D.C. EPA.\nKingman Park I, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 162-63.\n\n     The D.C. EPA requires the preparation of an EIS\nwhenever a “major action [is proposed or approved] that is\nlikely to have a substantial negative impact on the\nenvironment, if implemented.” D.C. Code § 8-109.03(a)\n(2012). The statute in turn defines “environment” as “the\nphysical conditions that will be affected by a proposed action,\nincluding but not limited to, the land, air, water, minerals,\nflora and fauna.” D.C. Code § 8-109.02 (2012). In the district\ncourt’s view, that language excludes impacts on the non-\nnatural environment such as traffic.\n\n     The statute also says that its “purpose . . . is to promote\nthe health, safety and welfare of District of Columbia . . .\nresidents, to afford the fullest possible preservation and\nprotection of the environment.” D.C. Code § 8-109.01\n(2012). The sequence “health, safety, and welfare” appears\nthree times in the statute, and in none of them is the sequence\nqualified by any limitation to the natural environment. This\nlanguage suggests inclusion of effects such as traffic and noise\nfelt primarily (or even exclusively, if such can be imagined) as\naspects of the human environment.\n\f                               7\n\n     Defending the district court ruling, the District notes that\nthe D.C. EPA differs from the federal equivalent, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 4332(C), by omitting the word “human” as a modifier of the\nprotected “environment.” The logic escapes us. The word\n“environment” would seem to encompass every environment,\nwhereas the “human environment,” if actually intended to be\ndifferent from the “environment,” appears narrower,\npotentially excluding any “non-human” environment—though\nas a practical matter such an exclusion would seem very\nnarrow in effect, given the human race’s near-ubiquity in the\nportions of the universe where a government might undertake\na project.\n\n    Indeed, the suggestion that the (unmodified)\n“environment” excludes community effects appears\nhopelessly artificial. Traffic, for example, consists of vehicles\nmoving over the land and through air, impacting the surface,\nemitting gases, and unleashing sound waves. We find it hard\nto imagine a concept of the environment that would exclude\nsuch effects (unless done so specifically). Unsurprisingly, the\nDistrict’s own Environmental Impact Screening Form asks\nabout traffic impacts.       Government of the District of\nColumbia, One City Street Car Line: H Street / Benning Road\nNE, Environmental Impact Screening Form (EISF) & Related\nStudies (“EISF and Related Studies”), Environmental Impact\nScreening Form at 6.\n\n     Though we think reliance on the legislative history is\nquite unnecessary, that history fits our interpretation:\n\n    The enactment of federal and state laws requiring the\n    preparation of EIS’s before undertaking major projects\n    that could potentially damage the environment have\n    proven worthwhile. . . . [S]imilar legislative measures\n    need to be enacted and implemented to further protect\n\f                               8\n\n    and preserve the human environment in the District of\n    Columbia.\n\nD.C. Council, Report on Bill 8-8, District of Columbia\nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1989, at 5 (June 5, 1989)\n(emphasis added).\n\n     Given that traffic is within the scope of the D.C. EPA, we\nnow ask whether traffic associated with the Project was\n“likely to have a substantial negative impact” requiring the\npreparation of an EIS. The Department of Consumer and\nRegulatory Affairs explicitly found that it was “not likely to\nhave” such an impact. Letter from Nicholas A. Majett,\nDirector of the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory\nAffairs to Faisl Hameed, District Department of\nTransportation, regarding Environmental Impact Screening\nForm (Feb. 27, 2013).           It prepared a 38-page draft\n“Transportation Technical Report” that it included as part of\nits Environmental Impact Screening Form for the Project.\nThe report concludes that the Project would not have a\nsubstantial impact on traffic conditions in any of the key\nanalyzed sections of the project area. EISF and Related\nStudies, Transportation Technical Report at 41-43. The\nanalysis addresses the concern about traffic in and out of the\nSpingarn site, noting that “travel in and out of the yard is only\nexpected to occur outside of peak analysis hours.” Id. at 10.\nGiven the deference we owe the agency, and the absence of\nmaterial conflicting evidence, we find no breach of the\nDepartment’s obligation.\n\n      Thus we are unpersuaded by the Association’s strongest\nargument regarding the District’s non-preparation of an EIS.\nIt follows that the district court must be affirmed with respect\nto the substantively weaker EIS arguments.\n\f                                9\n\n     Equal Protection. The Association claims that the\nDistrict’s selection of an overwhelmingly African American\nneighborhood for the installation of its first streetcar project,\nwhich of course might prove to be the last, violated the Equal\nProtection Clause.       But the Supreme Court held in\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976), that “a law\nneutral on its face and serving ends otherwise within the\npower of government to pursue, is [not] invalid under the\nEqual Protection Clause simply because it may affect a greater\nproportion of one race than of another.” Rather, a claim of\nracial discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause\nrequires a showing of “racially discriminatory purpose.” Id. at\n241.\n\n     The District did, indeed, cut significant procedural\ncorners, most particularly by giving only belated notice of the\nconstruction decision to the local member of the Advisory\nNeighborhood Commission. Kingman Park I, 27 F. Supp. 3d\nat 150, 169-70; Kingman Park II, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 184;\nAmended Complaint at 5; D.C. Code § 1-309.10 (2012). But\nthe Association has offered no evidence of a racially\ndiscriminatory purpose for this failure. The affected area is\nindeed predominantly African American. But so are many\nparts of the District. The District has advocated the streetcar\nprogram as a whole (a total of 37 miles) on the ground that it\nwill “provide high-capacity and high-quality transit service to\nDistrict residents and visitors,” and has expressed the hope\nthat the investment would “catalyze economic development.”\nEISF and Related Studies, Transportation Technical Report, at\nv. See also id., Historic Architectural Survey at 1. In framing\nits purposes of selecting specific locations to start, the District\nhas said that its goal was “to transform nine underinvested\ncorridors into thriving and inviting neighborhood centers.” Id.\nat 2. The Association doesn’t contest the application of those\npurposes to the Spingarn School area. Accordingly the\nProject and the associated site selection appear to have been\n\f                              10\n\nfacially neutral and to serve legitimate government purposes,\nand thus do not run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n     The Association makes several other claims that do not\nwarrant discussion in a published opinion. We affirm the\njudgment of the district court on these other issues.\n\n                            * * *\n\n    The judgment of the district court is\n\n                                            Affirmed.\n\f",

Supp. 3d at 155-58; we\nconfine ourselves to associational standing, which we find to\nhave been established.\n\n     As the district court noted, two members of the\nAssociation (Murray and Wiggins) filed declarations saying\nthat the wires would “adversely affect the clear and\nunobstructed views” of the Spingarn High School and the\nLangston Terrace, thus detracting from the aesthetic and\nrecreational value of areas that their declarations say they use.\nKingman Park I, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 156. These assertions are\nuncontested, and we see no reason to doubt that the overhead\nwires would have the effects stated and qualify as a concrete\ninjury, traceable to the District’s actions and remediable by an\ninjunction against those actions. Vindication of the two\nmembers’ interests is germane to the purpose of the\nAssociation, which the complaint describes as seeking “to\npreserve and protect the historic buildings, scenic views,\nintegrity and environment within the District of Columbia and\nspecifically, the Kingman Park neighborhood.” Id. at 155.\nNo reason appears why the members’ participation in the\nlawsuit would be necessary. Associational standing thus\nexists for the challenge to the Wire Acts. As we will explain\nshortly, this reasoning also applies to standing on the EIS and\nequal protection issues.\n\n    On the merits of the Wire Acts claim, the Association\nmisreads the Home Rule Act. That Act prohibits legislation\nby the Council “to amend or repeal any Act of Congress . . .\nwhich is not restricted in its application exclusively in or to\nthe District,” D.C. Code § 1-206.02(a)(3) (2012); the 1888\n\f                              5\n\nstatute was “restricted” in exactly that way. Thus, especially\ntaking into account the Home Rule Act’s stated purpose—to\n“relieve Congress of the burden of legislating upon essentially\nlocal District matters,” D.C. Code § 1-201.02(a) (2012)—the\n1888 provision is no obstacle to the Wire Acts.\n\n     Environmental Impact Statement.          The Association\nclaims that the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory\nAffairs improperly failed to prepare an environmental impact\nstatement, in violation of the D.C. Environmental Policy Act,\nD.C. Code § 8-109.03(a) (2012). The Association identified a\nvariety of harms that it said the District had inadequately\nconsidered, including increased car traffic, electromagnetic\nradiation from the overhead wires, noise, dust and particle\npollution, and water pollution. The district court dismissed\nthe EIS claim, in almost all instances on the ground that the\nDepartment’s consideration of these issues, viewed in light of\nthe Association’s ill-substantiated assertions of more severe,\nunacknowledged harms, was not arbitrary, capricious, or an\nabuse of discretion, the undisputed standard of review.\nKingman Park II, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 178-83. See also D.C.\nCode § 2-510(a)(3)(A) (2012); In re A.T., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123-\n24 (D.C. 2010).\n\n     The parties agree that the Association has standing to\nraise the EIS issue (and also the equal protection issues\ndiscussed below).       Although the district court found\norganizational standing, Kingman Park II, 27 F. Supp. 3d at\n178-83, we think it simpler to rely on associational standing,\nin view of Association members’ declarations as to their\nresidence and use of the neighborhood and (in connection\nwith the equal protection claim) their being African American.\nAnd there is no more problem here with regard to the second\nand third requirements of Hunt than there was for the Wire\nActs claim.\n\f                               6\n\n      We uphold the district court’s dismissal of the EIS claim,\nbut in part on different grounds. We begin by noting that the\nAssociation’s EIS claim regarding electromagnetic radiation\nwas waived because it was not raised in its Amended\nComplaint. Kingman Park II, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 179. Among\nthe remaining arguments, we take here as an illustration the\nAssociation’s strongest argument—the assertion of serious\ntraffic impacts, particularly around the Spingarn site, where\nthe streetcars would be stored; the other arguments are no\nbetter. The district court mistakenly dismissed this claim on\nthe theory that the traffic impacts were only on the\n“community” and thus not covered by the D.C. EPA.\nKingman Park I, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 162-63.\n\n     The D.C. EPA requires the preparation of an EIS\nwhenever a “major action [is proposed or approved] that is\nlikely to have a substantial negative impact on the\nenvironment, if implemented.” D.C. Code § 8-109.03(a)\n(2012). The statute in turn defines “environment” as “the\nphysical conditions that will be affected by a proposed action,\nincluding but not limited to, the land, air, water, minerals,\nflora and fauna.” D.C. Code § 8-109.02 (2012). In the district\ncourt’s view, that language excludes impacts on the non-\nnatural environment such as traffic.\n\n     The statute also says that its “purpose . . . is to promote\nthe health, safety and welfare of District of Columbia . . .\nresidents, to afford the fullest possible preservation and\nprotection of the environment.” D.C. Code § 8-109.01\n(2012). The sequence “health, safety, and welfare” appears\nthree times in the statute, and in none of them is the sequence\nqualified by any limitation to the natural environment. This\nlanguage suggests inclusion of effects such as traffic and noise\nfelt primarily (or even exclusively, if such can be imagined) as\naspects of the human environment.\n\f                               7\n\n     Defending the district court ruling, the District notes that\nthe D.C. EPA differs from the federal equivalent, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 4332(C), by omitting the word “human” as a modifier of the\nprotected “environment.” The logic escapes us. The word\n“environment” would seem to encompass every environment,\nwhereas the “human environment,” if actually intended to be\ndifferent from the “environment,” appears narrower,\npotentially excluding any “non-human” environment—though\nas a practical matter such an exclusion would seem very\nnarrow in effect, given the human race’s near-ubiquity in the\nportions of the universe where a government might undertake\na project.\n\n    Indeed, the suggestion that the (unmodified)\n“environment” excludes community effects appears\nhopelessly artificial. Traffic, for example, consists of vehicles\nmoving over the land and through air, impacting the surface,\nemitting gases, and unleashing sound waves. We find it hard\nto imagine a concept of the environment that would exclude\nsuch effects (unless done so specifically). Unsurprisingly, the\nDistrict’s own Environmental Impact Screening Form asks\nabout traffic impacts.       Government of the District of\nColumbia, One City Street Car Line: H Street / Benning Road\nNE, Environmental Impact Screening Form (EISF) & Related\nStudies (“EISF and Related Studies”), Environmental Impact\nScreening Form at 6.\n\n     Though we think reliance on the legislative history is\nquite unnecessary, that history fits our interpretation:\n\n    The enactment of federal and state laws requiring the\n    preparation of EIS’s before undertaking major projects\n    that could potentially damage the environment have\n    proven worthwhile. . . . [S]imilar legislative measures\n    need to be enacted and implemented to further protect\n\f                               8\n\n    and preserve the human environment in the District of\n    Columbia.\n\nD.C. Council, Report on Bill 8-8, District of Columbia\nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1989, at 5 (June 5, 1989)\n(emphasis added).\n\n     Given that traffic is within the scope of the D.C. EPA, we\nnow ask whether traffic associated with the Project was\n“likely to have a substantial negative impact” requiring the\npreparation of an EIS. The Department of Consumer and\nRegulatory Affairs explicitly found that it was “not likely to\nhave” such an impact. Letter from Nicholas A. Majett,\nDirector of the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory\nAffairs to Faisl Hameed, District Department of\nTransportation, regarding Environmental Impact Screening\nForm (Feb. 27, 2013).           It prepared a 38-page draft\n“Transportation Technical Report” that it included as part of\nits Environmental Impact Screening Form for the Project.\nThe report concludes that the Project would not have a\nsubstantial impact on traffic conditions in any of the key\nanalyzed sections of the project area. EISF and Related\nStudies, Transportation Technical Report at 41-43. The\nanalysis addresses the concern about traffic in and out of the\nSpingarn site, noting that “travel in and out of the yard is only\nexpected to occur outside of peak analysis hours.” Id. at 10.\nGiven the deference we owe the agency, and the absence of\nmaterial conflicting evidence, we find no breach of the\nDepartment’s obligation.\n\n      Thus we are unpersuaded by the Association’s strongest\nargument regarding the District’s non-preparation of an EIS.\nIt follows that the district court must be affirmed with respect\nto the substantively weaker EIS arguments.\n\f                                9\n\n     Equal Protection. The Association claims that the\nDistrict’s selection of an overwhelmingly African American\nneighborhood for the installation of its first streetcar project,\nwhich of course might prove to be the last, violated the Equal\nProtection Clause.       But the Supreme Court held in\nWashington v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242 (1976), that “a law\nneutral on its face and serving ends otherwise within the\npower of government to pursue, is [not] invalid under the\nEqual Protection Clause simply because it may affect a greater\nproportion of one race than of another.” Rather, a claim of\nracial discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause\nrequires a showing of “racially discriminatory purpose.” Id. at\n241.\n\n     The District did, indeed, cut significant procedural\ncorners, most particularly by giving only belated notice of the\nconstruction decision to the local member of the Advisory\nNeighborhood Commission. Kingman Park I, 27 F. Supp. 3d\nat 150, 169-70; Kingman Park II, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 184;\nAmended Complaint at 5; D.C. Code § 1-309.10 (2012). But\nthe Association has offered no evidence of a racially\ndiscriminatory purpose for this failure. The affected area is\nindeed predominantly African American. But so are many\nparts of the District. The District has advocated the streetcar\nprogram as a whole (a total of 37 miles) on the ground that it\nwill “provide high-capacity and high-quality transit service to\nDistrict residents and visitors,” and has expressed the hope\nthat the investment would “catalyze economic development.”\nEISF and Related Studies, Transportation Technical Report, at\nv. See also id., Historic Architectural Survey at 1. In framing\nits purposes of selecting specific locations to start, the District\nhas said that its goal was “to transform nine underinvested\ncorridors into thriving and inviting neighborhood centers.” Id.\nat 2. The Association doesn’t contest the application of those\npurposes to the Spingarn School area. Accordingly the\nProject and the associated site selection appear to have been\n\f                              10\n\nfacially neutral and to serve legitimate government purposes,\nand thus do not run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n     The Association makes several other claims that do not\nwarrant discussion in a published opinion. We affirm the\njudgment of the district court on these other issues.\n\n                            * * *\n\n    The judgment of the district court is\n\n                                            Affirmed.\n\f</pre>",
