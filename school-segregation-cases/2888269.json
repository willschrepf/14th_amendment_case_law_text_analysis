(“PSCC”) appeals from an adverse\n\njudgment on its contract claims against J.W.S. Delavau Co., Inc., and Accucorp\n\n                                           2\n\fPackaging, Inc. (collectively “Delavau”), entered after a bench trial. Delavau cross-\n\nappeals from an adverse judgment on its contract counterclaims against PSCC and for a\n\ndenial of an application for attorney fees. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1332,1 and this court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We will affirm\n\nthe judgment on PSCC’s contract claims, reverse the judgment on Delavau’s\n\ncounterclaims, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                             I\n\n       John Sadlon is a former employee of Lederle Laboratories and the president of\n\nPSCC. Sadlon worked for Lederle from 1979 to 1987. During that time, he met Richard\n\nDiBenedetto Sr., who was Lederle’s director of quality assurance. In that capacity,\n\nDiBenedetto Sr. would review the work of outside contractors, and was part of a four-\n\nperson inspection team charged with approving outside contractors.\n\n       After leaving Lederle in 1987, Sadlon worked at two other pharmaceutical\n\ncompanies and later founded PSCC. Through PSCC, Sadlon worked as a broker between\n\ncontractors and pharmaceutical companies. In October of 1990, Sadlon contacted\n\nDelavau, a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products, to ask if it would be interested in\n\ndoing business with an unnamed client. Sadlon and Delavau entered into a contract under\n\n\n\n   1\n    Pennsylvania is the state of incorporation and the principal place of business of\nDelavau and Accucorp. Although PSCC did not have a certificate of incorporation, the\nDistrict Court recognized it as a New Jersey corporation for the purposes of this litigation\nunder the doctrine of corporation of estoppel. Pharm. Sales & Consulting Corp v. J.W.S.\nDelavau Co., 59 F. Supp. 2d 398, 405-08 (D.N.J. 1999).\n\n                                             3\n\fwhich Sadlon would receive a 5% commission on any business he could bring to Delavau\n\nfrom his unnamed client, which turned out to be Lederle.\n\n       In late 1991, Sadlon made Laura Micelli his only business partner at PSCC, and he\n\nand Micelli orally agreed that she would get 50% of PSCC’s brokering revenue. There is\n\nno evidence in the record that Micelli had any expertise relevant to Sadlon’s business, and\n\nthe only evidence of any work she did for PSCC was that she created some spreadsheets\n\nand was involved in a few unsuccessful attempts to sell an idea for a home blood test kit\n\nto the laboratory company for which she worked. At the time Sadlon made Micelli his\n\npartner, she was engaged to Richard DiBenedetto Jr., who was living with his father,\n\nRichard DiBenedetto Sr.2 DiBenedetto Jr. and Micelli married in 1992.\n\n       In February and March of 1992, the District Court found, Sadlon and DiBenedetto\n\nSr. reached an agreement in which DiBenedetto Sr. would use his position at Lederle to\n\nassist PSCC in getting business for Delavau from Lederle, and in return, Sadlon would\n\ngive 50% of his brokering commissions to Micelli after she married DiBenedetto Jr.\n\n       In February of 1992, Sadlon contacted Delavau, referring to an unnamed “special\n\nconsultant” who would assist him in securing business for Delavau from Lederle. In\n\nMarch, he indicated to Ron Leff of Delavau that his “special consultant” needed to tour\n\n\n   2\n     The District Court found a pattern of financial instability surrounding DiBenedetto’s\nson, which included periods of unemployment, failed business ventures, and a guilty plea\nfor conspiracy to commit wire fraud by inflating and falsifying real-estate appraisals.\nDiBenedetto’s son declared bankruptcy in November 1992, declaring over four million\ndollars in debt, including $350,000 owed to DiBenedetto for loans for real-estate\ntransactions, room and board, gambling debts, and hospital bills.\n\n                                            4\n\fthe Delavau facility that month. On March 21, 1992, Sadlon, DiBenedetto Sr., and\n\nDiBenedetto Jr. traveled to the Delavau facility, and DiBenedetto Sr. toured it. Later that\n\nyear, a team of four people from Lederle, which included DiBenedetto Sr., toured the\n\nDelavau facility. DiBenedetto Sr.’s colleagues at Lederle were unaware of his prior visit\n\nto the Delavau facility.\n\n       In July of 1992, PSCC and Delavau entered into the contract at issue in this case.\n\nUnder the terms of the contract, PSCC would represent Delavau in negotiations with\n\nLederle, and in exchange Delavau would pay a commission of 5% of any business it\n\nreceived from Lederle. PSCC also agreed that any Lederle business in which it was in\n\nany way involved would be exclusively presented to Delavau, and that Delavau would\n\nhave a right of first refusal. In the event Lederle did not choose Delavau as the supplier\n\nfor a product that Delavau was capable of making, PSCC agreed to pay Delavau 2% of\n\nany sales it earned from placing that business with another supplier. The parties agreed\n\nthat New Jersey law would govern the contract and that “[i]f any legal action is brought\n\nby any of the parties [to the contract], . . . the party in whose favor final judgment shall be\n\nentered shall be entitled to recover from the other party reasonable attorney’s fees in\n\naddition to any other relief which may be granted.”\n\n       Between July 1992 and 1995, Delavau did a substantial amount of business with\n\nLederle—brokered by PSCC—and PSCC collected approximately $1 million in\n\ncommissions from Delavau. Sadlon did not begin giving Micelli her 50% cut until after\n\nshe married DiBenedetto Jr. in December of 1992. Thereafter, she received $461,000\n\n                                               5\n\ffrom PSCC between 1993 and 1995, which was deposited into a joint bank account held\n\nby Micelli and DiBenedetto Jr.\n\n       In 1993, Delavau learned that PSCC had brokered deals with Lederle for another\n\ncompany, Testpak, Inc., but continued to pay PSCC. In 1995, Delavau learned that PSCC\n\nhad tried to broker deals between Lederle and American Vitamin Company. After\n\nlearning of this, Delavau stopped paying PSCC’s commissions. PSCC responded by\n\nbringing this breach of contract action against Delavau in state court. Delavau removed\n\nthe case to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and asserted\n\ncounterclaims for breach of contract. In March of 2000, after learning of Micelli’s\n\nrelationship with DiBenedetto Jr., Delavau sought leave to amend its answer to raise a\n\ncommercial bribery defense to PSCC’s claims for breach of contract. The magistrate\n\njudge assigned to the case denied Delavau’s motion, but the District Court reversed and\n\nallowed Delavau to amend its answer.\n\n       Following a bench trial, the District Court found in favor of Delavau on PSCC’s\n\nbreach of contract claims based on its commercial bribery defense. It found in favor of\n\nPSCC on Delavau’s counterclaims, holding that Delavau would be unjustly enriched if\n\npermitted to recover under the contract. Finally, the District Court declined to award\n\nattorney fees to either party under the fee-shifting provision of the contract. The District\n\nCourt denied PSCC’s motion to reconsider and entered a final order. This appeal and\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fcross-appeal followed.3\n\n                                             II\n\n       When one party to a contract commits a crime or a tort in the course of\n\nperformance, if the wrongdoing is sufficiently serious and bears a sufficiently direct\n\nconnection to the contract, courts may excuse the innocent party from his obligation to\n\nperform. See McConnell v. Commonwealth Pictures Corp., 166 N.E.2d 494, 497 (N.Y.\n\n1960); 8 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts, § 19:40, at 378-80 (4th ed. 1998);\n\nRestatement of Contracts § 512 (1932). The New Jersey Superior Court has recognized\n\ncommercial bribery as a defense to an otherwise valid contract. Jaclyn, Inc. v. Edison\n\nBros. Stores, Inc., 406 A.2d 474, 483-85 (N.J. Super. Law Div. 1979).\n\n       The New Jersey commercial bribery statute provides that:\n\n              A person commits a crime if he solicits, accepts or agrees to accept\n       any benefit as consideration for knowingly violating or agreeing to violate a\n       duty of fidelity to which he is subject as:\n              [a]n agent, partner or employee of another [or] . . .\n              [a]n officer, director, manager or other participant in the\n\n\n   3\n    We exercise plenary review over legal determinations. Shire U.S. Inc. v. Barr Labs.\nInc., 329 F.3d 348, 352 (3d Cir. 2003). We review factual determinations under a clearly\nerroneous standard. Medtronic Ave, Inc. v. Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc., 247 F.3d\n44, 53 (3d Cir. 2001). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when it is “completely\ndevoid of minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of credibility or bears no\nrational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data.” Kool, Mann, Coffee & Co. v.\nCoffey, 300 F.3d 340, 353 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting Hoots v. Pennsylvania, 703 F.2d 722,\n725 (3d Cir. 1983)). Sitting in diversity, we are to apply state law as interpreted by the\nstate’s highest court, and where the state’s highest court has not addressed the issue, we\n“must be governed by a prediction of how the state’s highest court would decide were it\nconfronted with the problem.” Cooper Distrib. Co. v. Amana Refrigeration, Inc., 63 F.3d\n262, 274 (3d Cir. 1995).\n\n                                             7\n\f             direction of the affairs of an incorporated or unincorporated\n             association . . . .\n             A person commits a crime if he confers, or offers or agrees to confer,\n       any benefit the acceptance of which would be criminal under this section.\n\nN.J.S.A. § 2C:21-10.\n\n       After making detailed findings of fact, the District Court held that Delavau carried\n\nits burden of proving that PSCC committed commercial bribery in the course of\n\nperforming its contract with Delavau. The District Court found that PSCC paid $461,000\n\nto the daughter-in-law of DiBenedetto Sr. in exchange for DiBenedetto Sr.’s promise to\n\nsteer Lederle’s business to Delavau and thereby create commissions for PSCC. In doing\n\nso, the District Court held, DiBenedetto Sr. violated his duty of fidelity owed as an\n\nemployee, manager, and agent of Lederle. On the basis of its finding that PSCC\n\ncommitted commercial bribery in the course of performing its contract with Delavau, the\n\nDistrict Court held that PSCC was not entitled to pursue a claim for breach. On appeal,\n\nPSCC argues that this was in error.\n\n                                             A\n\n       First, PSCC argues that under the facts as found by the District Court,\n\nDiBenedetto Sr. did not receive a “benefit” within the meaning of the New Jersey\n\ncommercial bribery statute.4 Specifically, PSCC argues that the District Court erred by\n\nrelying on the language of N.J.S.A. § 2C:21-8.1(a) to define “any benefit,” and that a\n\n\n   4\n    PSCC also argues that the District Court found a violation of the commercial bribery\nstatute on the basis of insufficient evidence. We have reviewed the record and find the\nevidence sufficient to support the judgment below.\n\n                                             8\n\fproper definition of the term would exclude benefits of the type that DiBenedetto Sr.\n\nreceived.\n\n       In defining “any benefit,” the District Court relied on the language of N.J.S.A. §\n\n2C:21-8.1(a), which states as follows:\n\n       As used in chapter 21, unless a different meaning plainly is required:\n             “Benefit derived” means the loss resulting from the offense or\n             any gain or advantage to the actor, or coconspirators, or any\n             person in whom the actor is interested, whichever is greater,\n             whether loss, gain or advantage takes the form of money,\n             property, commercial interests or anything else the primary\n             significance of which is economic gain . . . . The benefit\n             derived or resulting harm in violation of chapter 21 shall be\n             determined by the trier of fact.\n\n(emphasis added). We agree with the District Court that the New Jersey commercial\n\nbribery statute, section 2C:21-10, should be read in conjunction with section 2C:21-\n\n8.1(a). Although the commercial bribery statute uses the word “benefit” rather than\n\n“benefit derived,” the most natural reading of the phrase “any benefit” is not narrower\n\nthan “benefit derived.”\n\n       PSCC notes, however, that the phrase “benefit derived” was once part of the\n\ncommercial bribery statute, but was eliminated when the legislature amended the statute\n\nin 1986. Such an amendment, PSCC argues, must be regarded as a deliberate choice by\n\nthe legislature to reject the definition of “benefit derived” in section 2C:21-8.1(a). We do\n\nnot find this argument persuasive, and we agree with the District Court that the 1986\n\namendments to the statute did not narrow the definition of the offense, but instead\n\nequated the penalties for offering and accepting a bribe.\n\n                                             9\n\f       Because we agree with the District Court’s construction of the statutory term\n\n“benefit,” we agree with its holding that DiBenedetto Sr. accepted a “benefit” within the\n\nmeaning of the statute. As the District Court found the facts, DiBenedetto Sr. accepted a\n\nbenefit in the form of $461,000 from PSCC handed over to his daughter-in-law and\n\nplaced in a joint bank account with his son. Thus, PSCC gave an indirect benefit to two\n\npersons in whom DiBenedetto Sr. had an interest—his son and his daughter-in-\n\nlaw—constituting a benefit under the statute.\n\n                                            B\n\n       Second, PSCC contends that the District Court erroneously relied on a private\n\nemployee conduct policy instead of New Jersey law in finding PSCC violated a duty of\n\nfidelity.5 We find this argument unpersuasive. Although PSCC is correct to note that\n\ncourts have expressed some concern about the expansion of the reach of penal statutes by\n\nprivate companies’ internal policies, it does not demonstrate that those concerns apply\n\nwith any force in this case. DiBenedetto Sr.’s actions constituted a breach of an\n\nemployee’s duty of fidelity within any reasonable construction of the statute. See United\n\n\n   5\n    The District Court found that DiBenedetto’s conduct violated both the pre-1994 and\npost-1994 conduct policies in place at Lederle. The policy effective between 1991 and\n1994 required all employees to maintain the highest ethical business and professional\nstandards, and to avoid activities that might conflict with the best interests of the\ncompany. It prohibited giving any gift or favor to any person or organization having a\nbusiness relationship with Lederle. The policy adopted in 1994 prohibited the holding of\na significant financial interest by an employee or any member of the employee’s\nimmediate family in the business of any supplier of Lederle, or of any competitor with, or\ncustomer of Lederle, when the employee was in a position to influence the relationships\nbetween the Company and the supplier, customer, or competitor.\n\n                                            10\n\fStates v. Lee, 359 F.3d 194, 204-05 (3d. Cir. 2004) (the statute reaches all breaches of\n\nduty, including the duty to refrain from self-dealing), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 955 (2004);\n\nCemeco, Inc. v. Gedicke, 724 A.2d 783, 789 (N.J. 1999) (employee’s self-dealing may\n\nbreach the duty of loyalty). The District Court’s factual findings on this point were not\n\nclearly erroneous, and we agree with the District Court that the facts as found establish a\n\nbreach of a duty of fidelity within the meaning of the New Jersey commercial bribery\n\nstatute.\n\n                                             C\n\n       Third, PSCC contends that even if it committed commercial bribery within the\n\nmeaning of the statute, the District Court erred by allowing Delavau to escape its\n\ncontractual obligations as a consequence. As noted, New Jersey courts recognize\n\ncommercial bribery as a defense in contract actions. Jaclyn, 406 A.2d at 482-85. PSCC\n\nargues, however, that because the text of the New Jersey commercial bribery statute does\n\nnot include unenforceability of contracts as a remedy for violations of the statute, the\n\nDistrict Court erred by allowing Delavau to use the statute as a defense to PSCC’s claims\n\nfor breach. In support of its argument, PSCC invokes cases such as Schuran v. Walnut\n\nHill Associates, 606 A.2d 885 (N.J. Super. Law. Div. 1991), and Bruce's Juices, Inc. v.\n\nAmerican Can Co., 330 U.S. 743 (1947). We do not agree.\n\n       In Bruce’s Juices, the Supreme Court declined to void the contract at issue because\n\nthe statute (the Robinson-Patman Act) included provisions for civil enforcement, by\n\nwhich a person injured by a violation of the Act could sue and recover triple damages and\n\n                                             11\n\fattorney fees. 330 U.S. at 750. Under those circumstances, the Supreme Court concluded\n\nthat Congress meant for the remedies prescribed in the Robinson-Patman Act to be the\n\nexclusive remedies available to aggrieved parties. Id. at 751-57.\n\n       Similarly, in Schuran, the New Jersey Superior Court found that the New Jersey\n\nlegislature had addressed the question of the scope of the civil remedies available for\n\nviolations of the usury statutes. Although the earliest New Jersey usury statutes provided\n\nthat usurious contracts were void, the legislature subsequently repealed those provisions.\n\nThe court in Schuran therefore concluded that it was inappropriate to permit a remedy\n\nthat the legislature had repealed.\n\n       In this case, by contrast, the New Jersey legislature does not appear to have\n\naddressed the issue of civil remedies for commercial bribery. The statute defines the\n\nprohibited behavior and provides only for criminal penalties. Unlike the usury statutes at\n\nissue in Schuran, there is no indication here that the New Jersey legislature intended to\n\nabolish civil consequences for a party who commits commercial bribery in the course of\n\nperforming a contract. As the Superior Court of New Jersey explained in Jaclyn, the\n\ncommercial bribery defense to a contract action finds it origins in common law, 406 A.2d\n\nat 482. When the New Jersey legislature enacted the criminal statute against this common\n\nlaw backdrop, the most sensible inference, we believe, is that the legislature intended only\n\nto codify a definition of the offense and to specify the attendant criminal penalties, but not\n\nto abolish the commercial bribery defense in civil contract actions. Thus, we discern no\n\nerror in the District Court’s dismissal of PSCC’s contract claims.\n\n                                             12\n\f                                              III\n\n       Although the District Court specifically held that PSCC and Delavau were not in\n\npari delicto as to the commercial bribery, it found that PSCC’s commercial bribery\n\ntainted the entire contract, and that Delavau would be unjustly enriched by a recovery on\n\nits counterclaims, in light of the fact that it was a sophisticated party and had “profited\n\nhandsomely from its business dealings with [Lederle].”\n\n       Where a contract is tainted by illegality in its terms or in the mode of performance\n\nelected by one of the parties, New Jersey courts inquire into whether the illegality can be\n\nexcised from the contract and the remainder enforced. See, e.g., Schuran, Inc. v. Walnut\n\nHill Assocs., 606 A.2d 885, 888 (N.J. Super. Law. Div. 1991) (enforcing a usurious\n\ncontract after excising the illegal portion of the interest); Naseef v. Cord, Inc., 216 A.2d\n\n413 (N.J. Super. App. Div. 1966) (declining to enforce an illegal contract where the\n\nillegal portion was not severable from the whole); 5 Williston on Contracts § 12:3, at 690-\n\n94 (4th ed. 1998) (“[T]he courts enforce the severable parts of an illegal divisible\n\nagreement where the unlawfulness does not permeate the whole, and even in the case of\n\nindivisible contracts, they strive to segregate and to uphold if possible such portions as\n\nmay be legal.”). The District Court correctly held that PSCC’s commercial bribery\n\ntainted the portion of the contract in which PSCC agreed to negotiate contracts between\n\nLederle and Delavau in exchange for fees from Delavau. Delavau indeed “profited\n\nhandsomely” from this arrangement, and was not entitled to recover through\n\ndisgorgement the fees it paid to PSCC. See McConnell v. Commonwealth Pictures Corp.,\n\n                                              13\n\f166 N.E. 2d 494, 499 (N.Y. App. 1960) (“Here, the contract between plaintiff and\n\ndefendant was perfectly legal, and defendant is seeking to avoid its obligations under the\n\ncontract of which it has reaped the benefits for some 12 years by asserting the illegality of\n\na different and subsequent agreement between plaintiff and a third party. This it should\n\nnot be permitted to do.”); Remsen Partners, Ltd. v. Stephen A. Goldberg Co., 755 A.2d\n\n412, 420-21 (D.C. 2000) (declining to require an unlicensed broker to disgorge fees paid\n\nto it where there was no bad faith involved and where the party hiring the broker profited\n\nfrom the broker’s services). Before us, Delavau concedes that the District Court was\n\ncorrect in denying it disgorgement, but notes that it brought counterclaims for both\n\ndisgorgement and breach of contract, and argues that it should not be prevented from\n\ngoing forward on its breach of contract counterclaim, in which it seeks to enforce the term\n\nof the contract entitling it to “2% of any sales earned by PSCC by virtue of brokering or\n\nplacing [Lederle’s] business with another supplier.” In our view, Delavau is correct, and\n\nthis portion is severable from the remainder of the contract. It is undisputed that Delavau\n\ndid not profit from PSCC’s placement of Lederle’s business with other companies, and\n\nthat Delavau was harmed by PSCC’s failure to honor that provision. As such, Delavau\n\nwould not be unjustly enriched if it were allowed to enforce that provision of the contract\n\nand to receive from PSCC what it bargained for.6 We will therefore reverse the District\n\n\n   6\n    The District Court cited several cases for the proposition that public policy weighed\nagainst allowing Delavau to recover on its counterclaims. Those cases involved\nconsiderations not relevant here. In re Independent Clearing House Co., 77 B.R. 843 (D.\nUtah 1987) involved a suit by investors in a Ponzi scheme against bankrupt trusts that had\n\n                                             14\n\fCourt’s judgment on Delavau’s breach of contract counterclaims and remand for\n\nadjudication of those claims. Once those claims are adjudicated, the District Court should\n\nrevisit the question whether Delavau is entitled to contractual attorney fees under New\n\nJersey law. See N. Bergen Rex Transp., Inc. v. Trailer Leasing Co., 730 A.2d 843, 848-\n\n49 (N.J. 1999). The judgment on PSCC’s claims will be affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nserved as clearinghouses for the funds of the scheme. Id. at 845-56. Under the investors’\ncontracts with the trusts, the investors were entitled to receive certain returns in excess of\ntheir initial investment. The District Court allowed the investors to recover their initial\ninvestment, but did not allow them to recover beyond that because any such recovery\nwould necessarily come at the expense of other victims of the same Ponzi scheme. Id. at\n858. In this case, there has been no showing that any recovery to Delavau from PSCC\nwould come at the expense of an innocent party. Dalton, Dalton, Little, Inc. v. Mirandi,\n412 F. Supp. 1001 (D.N.J. 1976), and Lothar’s of California v. Weintraub, 601 N.Y.S.2d\n231 (1993) both involved contractual arrangements that were themselves\nillegal—Mirandi involved a contract between an individual and an unlicensed architect,\nand Weintraub involved an accounting contract with an illegal contingent fee. Here,\nhowever, it is PSCC’s chosen mode of performance rather than a term of the contract\nitself that is illegal, and there is no public policy reason to penalize Delavau where there\nhas been no showing that it was in any way at fault for PSCC’s illegal conduct.\n\n                                              15\n\f",

(“PSCC”) appeals from an adverse\n\njudgment on its contract claims against J.W.S. Delavau Co., Inc., and Accucorp\n\n                                           2\n\fPackaging, Inc. (collectively “Delavau”), entered after a bench trial. Delavau cross-\n\nappeals from an adverse judgment on its contract counterclaims against PSCC and for a\n\ndenial of an application for attorney fees. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1332,1 and this court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We will affirm\n\nthe judgment on PSCC’s contract claims, reverse the judgment on Delavau’s\n\ncounterclaims, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                             I\n\n       John Sadlon is a former employee of Lederle Laboratories and the president of\n\nPSCC. Sadlon worked for Lederle from 1979 to 1987. During that time, he met Richard\n\nDiBenedetto Sr., who was Lederle’s director of quality assurance. In that capacity,\n\nDiBenedetto Sr. would review the work of outside contractors, and was part of a four-\n\nperson inspection team charged with approving outside contractors.\n\n       After leaving Lederle in 1987, Sadlon worked at two other pharmaceutical\n\ncompanies and later founded PSCC. Through PSCC, Sadlon worked as a broker between\n\ncontractors and pharmaceutical companies. In October of 1990, Sadlon contacted\n\nDelavau, a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products, to ask if it would be interested in\n\ndoing business with an unnamed client. Sadlon and Delavau entered into a contract under\n\n\n\n   1\n    Pennsylvania is the state of incorporation and the principal place of business of\nDelavau and Accucorp. Although PSCC did not have a certificate of incorporation, the\nDistrict Court recognized it as a New Jersey corporation for the purposes of this litigation\nunder the doctrine of corporation of estoppel.

There is\n\nno evidence in the record that Micelli had any expertise relevant to Sadlon’s business, and\n\nthe only evidence of any work she did for PSCC was that she created some spreadsheets\n\nand was involved in a few unsuccessful attempts to sell an idea for a home blood test kit\n\nto the laboratory company for which she worked. At the time Sadlon made Micelli his\n\npartner, she was engaged to Richard DiBenedetto Jr., who was living with his father,\n\nRichard DiBenedetto Sr.2 DiBenedetto Jr. and Micelli married in 1992.\n\n       In February and March of 1992, the District Court found, Sadlon and DiBenedetto\n\nSr. reached an agreement in which DiBenedetto Sr. would use his position at Lederle to\n\nassist PSCC in getting business for Delavau from Lederle, and in return, Sadlon would\n\ngive 50% of his brokering commissions to Micelli after she married DiBenedetto Jr.\n\n       In February of 1992, Sadlon contacted Delavau, referring to an unnamed “special\n\nconsultant” who would assist him in securing business for Delavau from Lederle. In\n\nMarch, he indicated to Ron Leff of Delavau that his “special consultant” needed to tour\n\n\n   2\n     The District Court found a pattern of financial instability surrounding DiBenedetto’s\nson, which included periods of unemployment, failed business ventures, and a guilty plea\nfor conspiracy to commit wire fraud by inflating and falsifying real-estate appraisals.\nDiBenedetto’s son declared bankruptcy in November 1992, declaring over four million\ndollars in debt, including $350,000 owed to DiBenedetto for loans for real-estate\ntransactions, room and board, gambling debts, and hospital bills.\n\n                                            4\n\fthe Delavau facility that month. On March 21, 1992, Sadlon, DiBenedetto Sr., and\n\nDiBenedetto Jr. traveled to the Delavau facility, and DiBenedetto Sr. toured it. Later that\n\nyear, a team of four people from Lederle, which included DiBenedetto Sr., toured the\n\nDelavau facility. DiBenedetto Sr.’s colleagues at Lederle were unaware of his prior visit\n\nto the Delavau facility.\n\n       In July of 1992, PSCC and Delavau entered into the contract at issue in this case.\n\nUnder the terms of the contract, PSCC would represent Delavau in negotiations with\n\nLederle, and in exchange Delavau would pay a commission of 5% of any business it\n\nreceived from Lederle. PSCC also agreed that any Lederle business in which it was in\n\nany way involved would be exclusively presented to Delavau, and that Delavau would\n\nhave a right of first refusal. In the event Lederle did not choose Delavau as the supplier\n\nfor a product that Delavau was capable of making, PSCC agreed to pay Delavau 2% of\n\nany sales it earned from placing that business with another supplier. The parties agreed\n\nthat New Jersey law would govern the contract and that “[i]f any legal action is brought\n\nby any of the parties [to the contract], . . . the party in whose favor final judgment shall be\n\nentered shall be entitled to recover from the other party reasonable attorney’s fees in\n\naddition to any other relief which may be granted.”\n\n       Between July 1992 and 1995, Delavau did a substantial amount of business with\n\nLederle—brokered by PSCC—and PSCC collected approximately $1 million in\n\ncommissions from Delavau. Sadlon did not begin giving Micelli her 50% cut until after\n\nshe married DiBenedetto Jr. in December of 1992. Thereafter, she received $461,000\n\n                                               5\n\ffrom PSCC between 1993 and 1995, which was deposited into a joint bank account held\n\nby Micelli and DiBenedetto Jr.\n\n       In 1993, Delavau learned that PSCC had brokered deals with Lederle for another\n\ncompany, Testpak, Inc., but continued to pay PSCC. In 1995, Delavau learned that PSCC\n\nhad tried to broker deals between Lederle and American Vitamin Company. After\n\nlearning of this, Delavau stopped paying PSCC’s commissions. PSCC responded by\n\nbringing this breach of contract action against Delavau in state court. Delavau removed\n\nthe case to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and asserted\n\ncounterclaims for breach of contract. In March of 2000, after learning of Micelli’s\n\nrelationship with DiBenedetto Jr., Delavau sought leave to amend its answer to raise a\n\ncommercial bribery defense to PSCC’s claims for breach of contract. The magistrate\n\njudge assigned to the case denied Delavau’s motion, but the District Court reversed and\n\nallowed Delavau to amend its answer.\n\n       Following a bench trial, the District Court found in favor of Delavau on PSCC’s\n\nbreach of contract claims based on its commercial bribery defense. It found in favor of\n\nPSCC on Delavau’s counterclaims, holding that Delavau would be unjustly enriched if\n\npermitted to recover under the contract. Finally, the District Court declined to award\n\nattorney fees to either party under the fee-shifting provision of the contract. The District\n\nCourt denied PSCC’s motion to reconsider and entered a final order. This appeal and\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fcross-appeal followed.3\n\n                                             II\n\n       When one party to a contract commits a crime or a tort in the course of\n\nperformance, if the wrongdoing is sufficiently serious and bears a sufficiently direct\n\nconnection to the contract, courts may excuse the innocent party from his obligation to\n\nperform.

The District Court found that PSCC paid $461,000\n\nto the daughter-in-law of DiBenedetto Sr. in exchange for DiBenedetto Sr.’s promise to\n\nsteer Lederle’s business to Delavau and thereby create commissions for PSCC. In doing\n\nso, the District Court held, DiBenedetto Sr. violated his duty of fidelity owed as an\n\nemployee, manager, and agent of Lederle. On the basis of its finding that PSCC\n\ncommitted commercial bribery in the course of performing its contract with Delavau, the\n\nDistrict Court held that PSCC was not entitled to pursue a claim for breach. On appeal,\n\nPSCC argues that this was in error.\n\n                                             A\n\n       First, PSCC argues that under the facts as found by the District Court,\n\nDiBenedetto Sr. did not receive a “benefit” within the meaning of the New Jersey\n\ncommercial bribery statute.4 Specifically, PSCC argues that the District Court erred by\n\nrelying on the language of N.J.S.A. § 2C:21-8.1(a) to define “any benefit,” and that a\n\n\n   4\n    PSCC also argues that the District Court found a violation of the commercial bribery\nstatute on the basis of insufficient evidence. We have reviewed the record and find the\nevidence sufficient to support the judgment below.\n\n                                             8\n\fproper definition of the term would exclude benefits of the type that DiBenedetto Sr.\n\nreceived.\n\n       In defining “any benefit,” the District Court relied on the language of N.J.S.A. §\n\n2C:21-8.1(a), which states as follows:\n\n       As used in chapter 21, unless a different meaning plainly is required:\n             “Benefit derived” means the loss resulting from the offense or\n             any gain or advantage to the actor, or coconspirators, or any\n             person in whom the actor is interested, whichever is greater,\n             whether loss, gain or advantage takes the form of money,\n             property, commercial interests or anything else the primary\n             significance of which is economic gain . . . . The benefit\n             derived or resulting harm in violation of chapter 21 shall be\n             determined by the trier of fact.\n\n(emphasis added). We agree with the District Court that the New Jersey commercial\n\nbribery statute, section 2C:21-10, should be read in conjunction with section 2C:21-\n\n8.1(a). Although the commercial bribery statute uses the word “benefit” rather than\n\n“benefit derived,” the most natural reading of the phrase “any benefit” is not narrower\n\nthan “benefit derived.”\n\n       PSCC notes, however, that the phrase “benefit derived” was once part of the\n\ncommercial bribery statute, but was eliminated when the legislature amended the statute\n\nin 1986. Such an amendment, PSCC argues, must be regarded as a deliberate choice by\n\nthe legislature to reject the definition of “benefit derived” in section 2C:21-8.1(a). We do\n\nnot find this argument persuasive, and we agree with the District Court that the 1986\n\namendments to the statute did not narrow the definition of the offense, but instead\n\nequated the penalties for offering and accepting a bribe.\n\n                                             9\n\f       Because we agree with the District Court’s construction of the statutory term\n\n“benefit,” we agree with its holding that DiBenedetto Sr. accepted a “benefit” within the\n\nmeaning of the statute. As the District Court found the facts, DiBenedetto Sr. accepted a\n\nbenefit in the form of $461,000 from PSCC handed over to his daughter-in-law and\n\nplaced in a joint bank account with his son. Thus, PSCC gave an indirect benefit to two\n\npersons in whom DiBenedetto Sr. had an interest—his son and his daughter-in-\n\nlaw—constituting a benefit under the statute.\n\n                                            B\n\n       Second, PSCC contends that the District Court erroneously relied on a private\n\nemployee conduct policy instead of New Jersey law in finding PSCC violated a duty of\n\nfidelity.5 We find this argument unpersuasive. Although PSCC is correct to note that\n\ncourts have expressed some concern about the expansion of the reach of penal statutes by\n\nprivate companies’ internal policies, it does not demonstrate that those concerns apply\n\nwith any force in this case. DiBenedetto Sr.’s actions constituted a breach of an\n\nemployee’s duty of fidelity within any reasonable construction of the statute. See United\n\n\n   5\n    The District Court found that DiBenedetto’s conduct violated both the pre-1994 and\npost-1994 conduct policies in place at Lederle. The policy effective between 1991 and\n1994 required all employees to maintain the highest ethical business and professional\nstandards, and to avoid activities that might conflict with the best interests of the\ncompany. It prohibited giving any gift or favor to any person or organization having a\nbusiness relationship with Lederle. The policy adopted in 1994 prohibited the holding of\na significant financial interest by an employee or any member of the employee’s\nimmediate family in the business of any supplier of Lederle, or of any competitor with, or\ncustomer of Lederle, when the employee was in a position to influence the relationships\nbetween the Company and the supplier, customer, or competitor.\n\n                                            10\n\fStates v.

As noted, New Jersey courts recognize\n\ncommercial bribery as a defense in contract actions. Jaclyn, 406 A.2d at 482-85. PSCC\n\nargues, however, that because the text of the New Jersey commercial bribery statute does\n\nnot include unenforceability of contracts as a remedy for violations of the statute, the\n\nDistrict Court erred by allowing Delavau to use the statute as a defense to PSCC’s claims\n\nfor breach. In support of its argument, PSCC invokes cases such as Schuran v.

We do not agree.\n\n       In Bruce’s Juices, the Supreme Court declined to void the contract at issue because\n\nthe statute (the Robinson-Patman Act) included provisions for civil enforcement, by\n\nwhich a person injured by a violation of the Act could sue and recover triple damages and\n\n                                             11\n\fattorney fees. 330 U.S. at 750. Under those circumstances, the Supreme Court concluded\n\nthat Congress meant for the remedies prescribed in the Robinson-Patman Act to be the\n\nexclusive remedies available to aggrieved parties. Id. at 751-57.\n\n       Similarly, in Schuran, the New Jersey Superior Court found that the New Jersey\n\nlegislature had addressed the question of the scope of the civil remedies available for\n\nviolations of the usury statutes. Although the earliest New Jersey usury statutes provided\n\nthat usurious contracts were void, the legislature subsequently repealed those provisions.\n\nThe court in Schuran therefore concluded that it was inappropriate to permit a remedy\n\nthat the legislature had repealed.\n\n       In this case, by contrast, the New Jersey legislature does not appear to have\n\naddressed the issue of civil remedies for commercial bribery. The statute defines the\n\nprohibited behavior and provides only for criminal penalties. Unlike the usury statutes at\n\nissue in Schuran, there is no indication here that the New Jersey legislature intended to\n\nabolish civil consequences for a party who commits commercial bribery in the course of\n\nperforming a contract. As the Superior Court of New Jersey explained in Jaclyn, the\n\ncommercial bribery defense to a contract action finds it origins in common law, 406 A.2d\n\nat 482. When the New Jersey legislature enacted the criminal statute against this common\n\nlaw backdrop, the most sensible inference, we believe, is that the legislature intended only\n\nto codify a definition of the offense and to specify the attendant criminal penalties, but not\n\nto abolish the commercial bribery defense in civil contract actions. Thus, we discern no\n\nerror in the District Court’s dismissal of PSCC’s contract claims.\n\n                                             12\n\f                                              III\n\n       Although the District Court specifically held that PSCC and Delavau were not in\n\npari delicto as to the commercial bribery, it found that PSCC’s commercial bribery\n\ntainted the entire contract, and that Delavau would be unjustly enriched by a recovery on\n\nits counterclaims, in light of the fact that it was a sophisticated party and had “profited\n\nhandsomely from its business dealings with [Lederle].”\n\n       Where a contract is tainted by illegality in its terms or in the mode of performance\n\nelected by one of the parties, New Jersey courts inquire into whether the illegality can be\n\nexcised from the contract and the remainder enforced.

The District Court correctly held that PSCC’s commercial bribery\n\ntainted the portion of the contract in which PSCC agreed to negotiate contracts between\n\nLederle and Delavau in exchange for fees from Delavau. Delavau indeed “profited\n\nhandsomely” from this arrangement, and was not entitled to recover through\n\ndisgorgement the fees it paid to PSCC. See McConnell v.

Before us, Delavau concedes that the District Court was\n\ncorrect in denying it disgorgement, but notes that it brought counterclaims for both\n\ndisgorgement and breach of contract, and argues that it should not be prevented from\n\ngoing forward on its breach of contract counterclaim, in which it seeks to enforce the term\n\nof the contract entitling it to “2% of any sales earned by PSCC by virtue of brokering or\n\nplacing [Lederle’s] business with another supplier.” In our view, Delavau is correct, and\n\nthis portion is severable from the remainder of the contract. It is undisputed that Delavau\n\ndid not profit from PSCC’s placement of Lederle’s business with other companies, and\n\nthat Delavau was harmed by PSCC’s failure to honor that provision. As such, Delavau\n\nwould not be unjustly enriched if it were allowed to enforce that provision of the contract\n\nand to receive from PSCC what it bargained for.6 We will therefore reverse the District\n\n\n   6\n    The District Court cited several cases for the proposition that public policy weighed\nagainst allowing Delavau to recover on its counterclaims.
