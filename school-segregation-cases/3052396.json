Later, Miller v. Alabama, 132 S. Ct.\n2455 (2012), held unconstitutional for juvenile offenders\nmandatory terms of life imprisonment without the possibility\nof parole. On resentencing, the district court refused to\nappoint a neuropsychological expert pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3006A(e) to help Pete develop mitigating evidence.\n\f4                   UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\n    Our principal question on appeal is whether the district\ncourt abused its discretion in declining to appoint such an\nexpert to aid the defense. We conclude that it did, and so\nremand for appointment of an expert, and for resentencing\nafter considering any expert evidence offered. We also\nconsider, and reject, Pete’s other challenges to his\nresentencing.\n\n                                 I.\n\nA. The Crime\n\n    In May 2002, Pete, a Navajo youth who lived on an\nArizona reservation, was riding in a car with three men,\nHoskie James, Harris James (Hoskie’s son1), and Irvin Cepi.\nAt the time, Pete was 16 years old, Hoskie was 41, Harris was\n20, and Cepi was 23. Hoskie drove the car. Pete and Harris\nhad been drinking for some time before meeting up with Cepi\nand Hoskie, and the four riders continued to drink while\ndriving.\n\n   Hoskie pulled over to pick up a hitchhiker, Charlotte\nBrown. After a period of driving, Hoskie stopped the car in\na wooded area and everyone got out. One member of the\ngroup suggested that they rape Brown. They then took turns\nholding her down and raping her.\n\n    After the rapes, everyone got back in the car. The victim\nsat between Pete and Cepi in the back seat, naked, while\nHoskie drove away. Although the exact events and\nchronology are unclear, it appears that either Brown\n\n  1\n    Because Harris and Hoskie James share a surname, we refer to them\nby their first names.\n\f                      UNITED STATES V. PETE                              5\n\nthreatened to call the police, or the group became concerned\nthat she would. As a result, some member of the\ngroup—probably Cepi—suggested killing her.\n\n     Hoskie stopped the car once again, and the victim was\neither ordered or dragged out of the car. She was then\nphysically forced or ordered to the ground. Pete and Harris\nheld Brown down while Cepi, who had retrieved a large rock,\nthrew it onto her head. Brown’s face was bleeding, but she\ncontinued to breathe, making “stuffy nose” sounds. Pete then\nthrew another rock at Brown’s head or face, apparently\nkilling her. Pete asked Harris to “throw [a rock] on her,” but\nHarris said no.\n\n    Pete and Cepi then dragged Brown’s body into a ditch and\ncovered it with rocks. The perpetrators returned to the car\nand drove home. Later, to conceal the crime, Harris and Pete\nset fire to Brown’s clothes and shoes and to their own\nclothing as well.\n\nB. Pre-Trial Events\n\n    After Brown’s remains were discovered, Pete was\narrested. He was held in Navajo tribal custody until a\njuvenile information was filed in the U.S. District Court for\nthe District of Arizona. United States v. Brandon P.,\n387 F.3d 969, 971 (9th Cir. 2004).2 The United States\npetitioned to try Pete as an adult, invoking the transfer\n\n\n\n\n 2\n   Although the record indicates that Pete spells his first name “Branden,”\nhis name was spelled “Brandon” in the case name of earlier iterations of\nthis case.\n\f6                         UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nprovisions of 18 U.S.C. § 5032.3 Id. In preparation for the\ntransfer proceedings, the court granted Pete’s request under\nsection 3006A(e) for a forensic psychiatric evaluation.\n\n    The forensic evaluator, Dr. Herschel D. Rosenzweig,\ninterviewed Pete for three hours in May 2003 and reviewed\na number of case-related materials. Dr. Rosenzweig\ndescribed Pete as “cordial, polite and cooperative throughout\nthe interview,” and as “wholly responsive to all inquiries to\nthe best of his ability.” Pete had “fair vocabulary and [a]\nrelatively poor fund of general information.” Pete’s “first\nlanguage is Navajo” and he “had a long history of learning\ndifficulties, [attending] special education programs while in\nschool.” Pete dropped out of school at the age of 13, in\nseventh grade, when his “level of learning in school was two\nto three years delayed.”\n\n    Pete’s “mother and father were severe alcoholics and\ndrank most of the time.” At the age of 14, Pete began to\ndrink alcohol more regularly than he had before (he didn’t\nremember when he first used alcohol) and began using\nmarijuana; at 15, he started using cocaine. Pete believed he\nwas “quite dependent and addicted to alcohol, and []\n\n\n\n    3\n        Section 5032 provides, in relevant part:\n\n             A juvenile alleged to have committed an act of juvenile\n             delinquency . . . shall not be proceeded against in any\n             court of the United States unless the Attorney General,\n             after investigation, certifies to the appropriate district\n             court of the United States that . . . the offense charged\n             is a crime of violence that is a felony . . . , and that\n             there is a substantial Federal interest in the case or the\n             offense to warrant the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. PETE                        7\n\nacknowledged that [he] ha[d] a serious problem with this\nsubstance.”\n\n    After dropping out of school, Pete lived with various\nfamily members. He worked odd jobs, mostly to earn money\nto buy alcohol and marijuana. Pete described getting into\ntrouble when he used alcohol, but said he didn’t drink while\nliving with his older brother in New Mexico. While living\nwith that brother, Pete studied for his GED and intended to\ncomplete the exam, but his mother urged him to come live\nwith her, back in Arizona, and he did. Pete’s father, who\nphysically abused both Pete and Pete’s mother, died shortly\nbefore Pete committed the crimes underlying this appeal.\n\n    Pete, Dr. Rosenzweig concluded, was a substance abuser\nwho “had virtually no support or help from his family while\nattending school,” and who, “with the exception of one older\nbrother . . . , d[id] not identify any positive role models within\nhis family system.” He “appear[ed] to be a youngster who\nc[ould] be readily intimidated, and influenced by others such\nthat he has little resilience against participating in drug and\nalcohol abuse when in the company of those who are so\ninclined.” “[B]ut when provided with [positive role] models,\nhe appears to be capable of responding in a very appropriate\nmanner.” The doctor noted that Pete was a model prisoner in\nhis ten months at the juvenile facility. According to staff, he\nhad been “an extremely cooperative inmate, had no incidents\nor inappropriate behavior,” and was “polite and cooperative,”\n“essentially . . . a model inmate,” attaining the top of five\nprivilege levels in his time there.\n\n    Dr. Rosenzweig opined, ultimately, that Pete was “a very\nsalvageable young man, and with adequate structure and\nsupport, appropriate treatment resources and abstinence from\n\f8                     UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nsubstance abuse, he ha[d] the potential of becoming a\nresponsible and productive citizen.”\n\n    The district court considered Dr. Rosenzweig’s evaluation\nbut rejected the doctor’s ultimate conclusions, on the ground\nthat the doctor’s opinion was influenced by Pete’s\ninconsistent recitation of the crime and events leading to it.\nThe court then granted the United States’ motion to transfer\nthe case to try Pete as an adult. Brandon P., 387 F.3d at 971.\nWe affirmed the transfer. Id. at 978.\n\nC. Convictions and Initial Sentencing\n\n    Pete’s trial began in October 2005. Harris pled guilty and\ntestified at Pete’s trial.4 United States v. Pete, 277 F. App’x\n730, 733 (9th Cir. 2008). The jury convicted Pete on counts\nof second-degree and felony murder, as well as conspiracy to\nmurder. The judge sentenced him to concurrent mandatory\nterms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole,\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1111.5\n\n   We affirmed the convictions and sentence on all grounds.\nSee Pete, 277 F. App’x 730; United States v. Pete, 525 F.3d\n844 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\n\n\n\n        4\n    Cepi was convicted by a jury and sentenced to life imprisonment\nwithout the possibility of parole. See 18 U.S.C. § 1111.\n    5\n      In relevant part, section 1111 provides: “Whoever is guilty of murder\nin the first degree shall be punished by death or by imprisonment for life\n. . . .” 18 U.S.C. § 1111(b). Pete’s felony murder convictions were treated\nas first-degree murder. See id. § 1111(a).\n\f                        UNITED STATES V. PETE                           9\n\nD. Requests for Resentencing and for an Expert\n\n    In 2013, after the Supreme Court decided Miller, Pete\nmoved for resentencing. The district court granted the\nmotion, noting that Miller requires the court to give a juvenile\noffender “an opportunity to present mitigating evidence to\nsupport a sentence less than life without parole,” and ordering\nthat Pete be resentenced on an open record.6\n\n    Before the resentencing, Pete filed an ex parte motion for\nexpert services pursuant to section 3006A(e),7 requesting that\nMarc Walter, Ph.D., be paid to assist him. Pete explained that\nDr. Walter’s help was “necessary to pursue information that\nmight mitigate or lessen the sentence imposed on\nresentencing.” Noting the passage of more than a decade\nsince preparation of the original PSR and Dr. Rosenzweig’s\nforensic evaluation, Pete explained:\n\n           Dr. Walter would conduct a comprehensive\n           neuropsychological evaluation which would\n\n\n  6\n    The United States agreed before the district court that Miller applies\nretroactively and does not contest its retroactivity on appeal. After this\ncase was argued, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the Miller rule is\nretroactive. See Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S. Ct. 718 (2016).\n 7\n      Section 3006(A)(e)(1) provides:\n\n           Upon request. –Counsel for a person who is financially\n           unable to obtain investigative, expert, or other services\n           necessary for adequate representation may request them\n           in an ex parte application. Upon finding, after\n           appropriate inquiry in an ex parte proceeding, that the\n           services are necessary and that the person is financially\n           unable to obtain them, the court . . . shall authorize\n           counsel to obtain the services.\n\f10                 UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\n       let us know [Pete’s] ‘mental age’, whether he\n       has any cognitive dysfunction which could\n       make him more suggestible or impair his\n       judgment, and whether he has any particular\n       mental disorders which could have played into\n       his behavior.\n\nFurther, Dr. Walter “could offer insights into the impact\nincarceration has had on Mr. Pete, who has been in\nsegregation much of his confinement.”\n\n      The court denied Pete’s motion. It held that although Pete\nis financially qualified for an expert, he had not shown Dr.\nWalter’s services were “necessary” within the meaning of\nsection 3006A. The court noted that “[t]he purpose of th[e]\nre-sentencing is to allow defendant Pete to present mitigating\nevidence in support of a sentence of less than life without\nparole, in accordance with Miller . . . .” Pete’s “2003\npsychiatric evaluation . . . includes such evidence,” said the\ncourt, and although Pete “implie[d] that the passage of time\nmay impact that evidence, . . . it is difficult to conceive how\n. . . . For example, the passage of time would not change his\n‘family and home environment’ nor the ‘circumstances of the\nunderlying homicide offense.’” “Not only that,” explained\nthe court, “but the 2003 evaluation encompasses the matters\nwhich the neuropsychologist intends to evaluate, rendering a\nsecond evaluation duplicative.” Lastly, “any ‘insights into\nthe impact incarceration has had’ on [Pete] is not the type of\nmitigating evidence which Miller contemplates.”\n\nE. The Pre-Sentence Report (“PSR”)\n\n    In preparation for resentencing, the U.S. Probation Office\ncalculated the offense level for Pete’s crimes as 43.\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. PETE                   11\n\nOriginally, the PSR recommended that three of Pete’s\njuvenile offenses be assigned two criminal history points\neach. The PSR also discussed Pete’s prison record, which\nincluded:\n\n       January 25, 2008, possessing intoxicants;\n       January 29, 2008, possessing a dangerous\n       weapon; March 13, 2008, fighting with\n       another person; May 30, 2008, destroying\n       property over $100; October 24, 2008,\n       refusing to take alcohol test and being in an\n       unauthorized area; March 15, 2009, assault\n       without serious injury, wherein the defendant\n       struck with his shoulder a staff member while\n       in restraints; December 8, 2011, possession of\n       a dangerous weapon; April 17, 2012,\n       interfering with security devices, wherein the\n       defendant burned a hole in the exterior\n       window of his cell; April 22, 2012, setting a\n       fire on the SHU range; June 27, 2012,\n       refusing work/program assignment, wherein\n       the defendant refused to accept a cellmate\n       because he was not willing to accept “just any\n       cellie;” October 31, 2013, destroy property\n       $100 or less.\n\n    The PSR concluded that the Guidelines range for Pete’s\ncrimes was life, and that, pursuant to section 1111, he was\nsubject to two life sentences for the felony murder\nconvictions. The probation officer recommended a life\nsentence because of “the seriousness of the offense and [to]\nprotect the public from further crimes.”\n\f12                 UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\n    Pete objected to the six criminal history points attributed\nto three of his juvenile offenses in the PSR. The calculation\nwas incorrect, he contended, because he never served a\nsentence for those offenses. The probation officer adjusted\nthe calculation to give the offenses one point rather than two,\nbut noted that this did not affect the Guidelines’\nrecommendation of a life sentence.\n\n    Pete also challenged the PSR’s characterization of his\nprison record, pointing out that (1) he had explained the\ncircumstances surrounding each infraction; (2) ten “minor\nincidents in more than seven years is not unusual for an\ninmate confined prior to age 18, and [is] also not unusual for\nan inmate who has been transferred between nine different\ninstitutions”; and (3) “because these incidents came in spurts\nover a relatively short period of time, external stressors most\nlikely prompted” them.\n\nF. Resentencing Proceeding\n\n    At resentencing, the court first reviewed the PSR with the\nparties, asking whether the proper calculation of criminal\nhistory points for Pete’s juvenile offenses had been resolved.\nPete’s attorney confirmed, and the United States agreed, that\nthe issue had been resolved.\n\n    Pete’s counsel, Daniel Drake, then argued. Drake\nreported that he had met with Pete several times in\npreparation for resentencing and was struck by his client’s\ninquisitiveness. Pete was “quite unlike” his teenage self,\nDrake maintained. Pete and Drake had discussed “a number\nof things, interesting things that, again, belie what [Pete] was\nlike when he was 16.” Drake listed Pete’s recent reading\nmaterials, “including Friedrich Nietzche’s[] Beyond Good\n\f                     UNITED STATES V. PETE                           13\n\nand Evil[,] . . . Victor Frankl’s[] Man’s Search For Meaning,\n. . . [and] The Alchemist.” According to Drake, “[t]hese\nthings intrigue [Pete]. I can’t imagine they would have\ncaught his attention at the age of 16.” Referring to the\ncomments of a woman with whom Pete had corresponded\nover the years, Drake summarized, “Mr. Pete is a different\nperson than he was when he committed this offense or when\nhe was sentenced the first time.”\n\n    Drake then discussed the crime, noting that the jury chose\nnot to convict Pete of first-degree murder. He emphasized\nthat Cepi, not Pete, instigated the crime; that Pete was the\nyoungest participant; and that the car’s occupants were\ndrinking heavily. Further, the 2003 evaluation revealed that\nPete’s cognitive processes as a juvenile mirrored those that\nconcerned the justices and underlay the decisions in Miller\nand Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005).8\n\n    Drake then reviewed the 18 U.S.C. § 3553 sentencing\nfactors, explaining, among other things, that, were a life\nsentence reimposed, Pete would not be allocated the limited\nrehabilitative services available in prison; that a life sentence\nwas not necessary to protect the public, “given Mr. Pete’s\ngrowth and maturation”; and that deterrence would not be\nserved by a life sentence because of the nature and extent of\ncrime on the Navajo reservation.\n\n    Next, Drake explained that Pete had been in segregation\nfor much of his dozen years in prison and had been\ntransferred many times. His status as a sex offender made\nhim subject to mistreatment by other prisoners. The isolation,\n\n 8\n   Roper held unconstitutional capital punishment imposed on individuals\nwho were under 18 at the time of their crimes.\n\f14                 UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nfrequent transfer, and mistreatment were relevant to Pete’s\nsentence, according to Drake, in two ways. First, they\nindicated that Pete would be affected in an excessively\nnegative way by spending a lifetime in prison, nearly always\nin isolation. Second, Pete’s sex offender status explained at\nleast three of his assaultive infractions. Because of his status,\nother inmates “jumped him,” and he had to fight back in self-\ndefense. Also, he had been placed in a cell with another\ninmate with whom he felt unsafe.\n\n      Pete then personally addressed the court. He thanked the\ncourt for the opportunity to speak; described prison as a\n“rough journey” that had taken a mental and emotional toll on\nhim; and explained that because he had spent 80% of his time\nin solitary confinement, he had done a lot of thinking, with\nthe result that he felt he had “to better [him]self with\nknowledge, wisdom, understanding, and to . . . have goals\n. . . .” When the court asked about Pete’s work toward his\nGED, Pete noted that he had studied and taken pretests, but\nthat his solitary confinement prevented him from progressing\nfurther.\n\n     “[T]he majority of the reason” that he was in solitary\nconfinement, Pete explained, was fear for his life. Being in\nthe “general population . . . , as with my charges, you know,\nit’s political,” and the “majority of penitentiary is run by\ngangs.” But he maintained that he had changed quite a bit.\nHe now had “morals, principles, and a code [he goes] by in\n[his] daily routine, and [he does] his best each and every day\nto meet those goals.” Pete emphasized that he had “changed\na lot,” “matured” and “grown a lot,” that he didn’t “have the\nsame mindframe as [he] had as an adolescent, as a youth, at\nthe age of 16,” and that he now had goals and wanted to do\nsomething positive with his life. Although he wished his\n\f                  UNITED STATES V. PETE                     15\n\ncrimes “didn’t happen,” he couldn’t change the fact that they\nhad.\n\n    The prosecutor then spoke.            Addressing Pete’s\nrepresentation that he had changed, the prosecutor challenged\nthat portrayal: “The defendant says that he has changed, that\nhe has matured. His disciplinary record from the bureau of\nprisons is at odds with that.” The prosecutor noted that Pete\nwas at first housed in the general population but then had to\nbe placed in segregated housing, “because he gets in trouble.”\nFurther, Pete had not made much progress toward his GED,\nhaving participated in fifteen or twenty classes, and then\nwithdrawing in late 2013, which, the prosecutor suggested,\nmeant Pete was not following through on his asserted goals.\n\n    The cruel nature of the crime, the prosecutor continued,\njustified any deviation between Pete’s sentence and those\nimposed on other juveniles. As an example, the prosecutor\nreferred to Pete’s behavior, throwing the rock that probably\nkilled Brown, while Harris refused to participate in stoning\nBrown. Pete’s participation was not due to juvenile\nimpulsivity or poor judgment, discussed in Miller, the\nprosecutor maintained. Overall, said the prosecutor: “I think\nthat that singular act of depravity is just evil. It is not\nexplained by the fact that you were neglected or you drink.”\n\n    The district court then imposed the sentence. The court\nreasoned that Pete’s prison infractions indicated he had not\nmatured. Next, the court discussed the crime, noting that Pete\n“was an active knowing and willing participant,” that Pete\nhad had time to consider whether he wanted to participate,\nbut that he chose to “deliver[] the fatal blow” and dispose of\nBrown’s body and clothing, and that the crime was “one of\nthe most cruel, deliberate, heinous acts I have seen in over 40\n\f16                 UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nyears.”      The court also emphasized that Pete had\n“demonstrated his violence and his antisocial nature while in\njail . . . .” Disagreeing with Dr. Rosenzweig’s ultimate\nprediction about Pete, “particularly when he said . . . he\nthought there was some opportunities for the defendant to\ncorrect himself,” the court announced that any sentence less\nthan life would mean that, “upon release . . . , [Pete] still\nposes a danger, and although they seem to suggest that after\nthe age of 35 people start to diminish their propensity for\ncriminal activity, I am not so sure it is accurate in this case.”\nAlthough it acknowledged Pete’s drinking and family life, the\ncourt opined that, “instead of trying to be better than the\ncircumstances of his parents, [Pete] gave into it, and most of\nthe time he spent as a youth was out of school, drinking,\ndoing drugs, and getting into trouble, and there’s no\nindication that that would go unabated.”\n\n    To calculate the exact sentence, the court reasoned that\nPete’s life expectancy was 75 years. It then subtracted Pete’s\nage and the amount of time he had already served to come to\na sentence of 708 months—59 years—as the total appropriate\nsentence, elaborating:\n\n        That means that you have the opportunity to\n        get out of jail, Mr. Pete, when you are 75\n        years old and live the balance of whatever life\n        you have left back on the reservation.\n\n        By that time, the families will be gone. You\n        will certainly be beyond the age of probably\n        violent behavior. I doubt that even with that\n        given amount of time you’ll be able to do\n        anything productive, but at least it gives you\n\f                     UNITED STATES V. PETE                           17\n\n         a chance to pass on from this life into the next\n         outside of the confines of the prison yard.\n\nThe court thereupon imposed a 708-month sentence.\n\n                                  II.\n\n    On appeal, Pete first challenges the district court’s denial\nof his motion for an expert under section 3006A(e). “A\ndistrict court’s denial of a request for public funds to hire an\nexpert is reviewed for abuse of discretion.” United States v.\nRodriguez-Lara, 421 F.3d 932, 939 (9th Cir. 2005), overruled\non other grounds by United States v. Hernandez-Estrada,\n749 F.3d 1154, 1164 (9th Cir. 2014).\n\n    “The purpose of the Criminal Justice Act [is] to put\nindigent defendants as nearly as possible in the same position\nas nonindigent defendants . . . .” United States v. Sanders,\n459 F.2d 1001, 1002 (9th Cir. 1972). For that reason, under\nsection 3006A(e), “a district judge shall authorize the\nprovision of expert services to a defendant financially unable\nto obtain them9 where such services are necessary for\nadequate representation.” Rodriguez-Lara, 421 F.3d at 939.\nA district court thus abuses its discretion in denying an expert\n“where (1) reasonably competent counsel would have\nrequired the assistance of the requested expert for a paying\nclient, and (2) the defendant was prejudiced by the lack of\nexpert assistance.” Id. at 940 (citation omitted).\n\n    Here, both those conditions were satisfied.\n\n\n\n  9\n    The parties do not dispute that Pete is financially qualified for an\nexpert.\n\f18                UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nA. Necessity\n\n    Critical to the question before us is the well-established\nprinciple that “a court’s duty is always to sentence the\ndefendant as he stands before the court on the day of\nsentencing.” United States v. Quintieri, 306 F.3d 1217, 1230\n(2d Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). Further, where, as here, a\ncourt is resentencing on an open record, the court is “free to\nconsider any matters relevant to sentencing, even those that\nmay not have been raised at the first sentencing hearing, as if\nit were sentencing de novo.” United States v. Matthews,\n278 F.3d 880, 885–86 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc); see also\nPepper v. United States, 562 U.S. 476, 490 (2011) (“[A]\ndistrict court may consider evidence of a defendant’s\nrehabilitation since his prior sentencing.”). Applying those\nprecepts, we have rejected the contention that at resentencing\na district court should not consider intervening events, see\nUnited States v. Jones, 114 F.3d 896, 897–98 (9th Cir. 1997),\nand have held that a district court should have explained why\na PSR was not updated for resentencing, as the earlier PSR\ndid not account for five years during which time the\ndefendant was imprisoned, see United States v. Turner,\n905 F.2d 300 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\n    More specifically on point here is United States v.\nHernandez, in which the Second Circuit ruled that a district\ncourt should have considered changes in the defendant over\nthe course of the 15 years since the original sentence,\nincluding how the defendant’s aging affected the likelihood\nof his recidivism; his rehabilitation in the interim; and\nintervening changes in sentencing law. See 604 F.3d 48,\n53–55 (2d Cir. 2010). We agree with Hernandez that at a\nresentencing, a district court should consider how the passage\nof time, including the defendant’s maturation and personal\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. PETE                        19\n\ndevelopment in the interim, affect such sentencing factors as\nlikelihood of rehabilitation and recidivism.\n\n    In rejecting the motion to appoint an expert, the district\ncourt expressed views inconsistent with that principle. In\nparticular, the district court noted that Pete’s upbringing and\nthe circumstances of the crime have not changed, and\nmaintained that because a psychiatric evaluation had been\ndone in 2003, a second evaluation would be “duplicative.”\n“[I]t is difficult to conceive how,” the district court stated,\n“the passage of time may impact [the psychiatric] evidence”\npresented during the pretrial proceedings nearly ten years\nbefore. Further, the district court held that the impact of\nincarceration on Pete “is not the type of mitigating evidence\nwhich Miller contemplates.” We disagree with the district\ncourt as to all three aspects of its reasoning.\n\n     First, an evaluation for resentencing would not duplicate\nthe 2003 evaluation. The 2003 evaluation did address Pete’s\nfamily and home environment and the circumstances of the\noffense, including the extent of his participation and what\nfamilial and peer pressures may have played a role. Those\nsection 3553 factors have not changed since Pete committed\nthe offense. But his chronological age has changed. Contrary\nto the district court’s assertion that “it is difficult to conceive\nhow” the passage of time mattered with regard to Pete’s\nfamily background and the nature of the crime, the passage of\ntime could affect the degree to which Pete was negatively\naffected by his difficult upbringing, as well as what lessons\nhe had learned, if any, by reflecting on the crime. Indeed,\n“Miller requires a sentencer to consider a juvenile offender’s\nyouth and attendant characteristics before determining that\nlife without parole is a proportionate sentence.” Montgomery,\n136 S. Ct. at 734. Moreover, if contemporary factors relating\n\f20                 UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nto psychological maturation and personal evolution were\ndeveloped, the passage of time could affect the weight given\nto Pete’s family background and the circumstances of the\ncrime in the overall mix of mitigating circumstances.\n\n    Second, an individual’s psychological makeup could\ncertainly change significantly over a ten-year period, both\ncognitively and emotionally. Two psychological evaluations\nten years apart are simply not “duplicative.” Cf. Griffin v.\nJohnson, 350 F.3d 956, 965 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding a current\npsychological evaluation “minimally probative” of a\ndefendant’s mental capacity to commit murder eight years\nearlier); Eley v. Bagley, 604 F.3d 958, 967 (6th Cir. 2010)\n(concluding that psychiatric evaluations performed nearly ten\nyears after a crime had “virtually no probative value” in\nassessing the defendant’s mental state at the time of the\ncrime).\n\n    The district court’s determination to the contrary was\nseemingly premised on an erroneously narrow temporal\nfocus—that is, on the assumption that only Pete’s mental\nstatus at the time of the crime and during the 2003 transfer\nevaluation is relevant. As we have discussed, however, the\nresentencing should have taken into account—and, indeed, to\nsome degree did take into account—an assessment of the\nrelevant factors, including the prospects for rehabilitation, as\nof the time of the resentencing.\n\n    Moreover, the likelihood of psychological change\nover time is very much heightened when, as here, the\ndefendant was a juvenile both at the time of the crime and at\nthe earlier psychological evaluation. As Miller observed,\n“developments in psychology and brain science continue to\nshow fundamental differences between juvenile and adult\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. PETE                      21\n\nminds—for example, in parts of the brain involved in\nbehavior control.” 132 S. Ct. at 2464 (citation omitted). The\nCourt in Miller also emphasized the specific characteristics of\njuvenile brain development and resulting mental states that\noften cause juveniles’ impulsivity, recklessness, and\nvulnerability to outside pressures. See id. at 2464–65. As a\nresult of these characteristics, juveniles have less control over\ntheir actions, and, critically, greater capacity to change over\ntime so as not to repeat similar behavior, as compared to\nadults. Id. Youth’s “signature qualities are all transient,”\nconcluded Miller. Id. at 2467 (citation omitted).\n\n    Miller also stressed that certain policy rationales\nunderlying hefty punishments—culpability, incapacitation,\nand rehabilitation—differ as applied to juveniles. Id. at\n2464–65. “Miller, then, did more than require a sentencer to\nconsider a juvenile offender’s youth before imposing life\nwithout parole; it established that the penological\njustifications for life without parole collapse in light of ‘the\ndistinctive attributes of youth.’” Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at\n734 (quoting Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2465).\n\n     To account for the transience of youthful characteristics\nand the differing policy considerations applicable to minors,\nMiller mandated that a juvenile offender be “provide[d] some\nmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on\ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.” Id. at 2469\n(citation omitted). Accordingly, although Miller does “not\nforeclose a sentencer’s ability to [impose life imprisonment]\nin homicide cases,” the case does “require [the sentencer] to\ntake into account how children are different, and how those\ndifferences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a\nlifetime in prison.” Id.\n\f22                UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\n    When the district court ruled that no expert testimony was\n“necessary,” it ignored Miller’s reasoning and directives. At\nthe time of resentencing, Pete’s neuropsychological condition\nhad not been evaluated in more than a decade. An updated\nevaluation could have revealed whether Pete was the same\nperson psychologically and behaviorally as he was when he\nwas 16. Rather than being “duplicative,” as the district court\nbelieved, a new evaluation could have shown whether the\nyouthful characteristics that contributed to Pete’s crime had\ndissipated with time, or whether, instead, Pete is the “rare\njuvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable\ncorruption.” Id. at 2469 (citation omitted); see also\nMontgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 733. Similarly, without current\ninformation relating to the policy rationales applicable\nspecifically to juvenile offenders, Pete was hamstrung in\narguing for a more lenient sentence.\n\n    More specifically, the significant mitigating evidence\navailable to Pete at resentencing, other than his own\ntestimony and that of his lawyer (neither of which the district\ncourt credited), would have been information about his\ncurrent mental state—in particular, whether and to what\nextent he had changed since committing the offenses as a\njuvenile. This information was directly related to Pete’s\nprospects for rehabilitation, including whether he continued\nto be a danger to the community, and therefore whether the\nsentence imposed was “sufficient, but not greater than\nnecessary, to comply with the purposes” of sentencing.\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a); see id. (a)(2)(C), (D). Such information\nis pertinent to determining whether, as Miller indicates is\noften the case, Pete’s psychological makeup and prospects for\nbehavior control had improved as he matured, with the\nconsequence that his prospects for rehabilitation and the need\nfor incapacitation had changed.\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. PETE                     23\n\n    The third reason the district court gave for rejecting the\nrequest for funds to conduct a current psychological\nevaluation—that the impact of incarceration “is not the type\nof mitigating evidence [] Miller contemplates”—fares no\nbetter. As it turned out, the United States, and the district\ncourt, emphasized information about Pete’s incarceration at\nthe resentencing hearing, relying on the PSR to conclude that\nPete’s prison record indicated he had not appreciably changed\nor matured in the twelve years since he committed the\noffense. Yet, the district court precluded Pete from\ndeveloping key rebuttal evidence—namely, current evidence\nas to his mental state. The refusal to authorize expert services\nthus assured a lopsided presentation of evidence, favoring the\nUnited States.\n\n    In particular, the court’s refusal to approve a new\npsychological appraisal denied Pete the opportunity to\nrespond effectively to the PSR’s discussion of his prison\nrecord or to provide corroborating evidence that could\nsubstantiate his explanations for his prison infractions. Pete’s\nexplanation for his prison record was that his status as a sex\noffender caused him to be mistreated by other inmates, and\ntherefore resulted in him being placed, indefinitely, in\nsegregated housing. An expert’s testimony could have\nbolstered Pete’s arguments that the infractions, which tended\nto come in spurts over relatively short periods of time,\nreflected external stressors (such as mistreatment by other\ninmates), not some inherent and intractable defect in Pete’s\nmature personality. See Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2464 (citing\n“studies showing that only a relatively small proportion of\nadolescents who engage in illegal activity develop entrenched\npatterns of problem behavior” (citation and internal\nalterations omitted)); Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 733, 734.\nSimilarly, the expert could have opined as to the excessively\n\f24                UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nnegative psychological impact that could result from placing\nPete in segregated housing for many more years, were his\nsentence to remain lengthy. In all these respects, an expert\ncould have provided substantive evidence to support the\nargument that Pete’s prison record did not suggest he lacked\nthe capacity for rehabilitation before the age of 75.\n\n    To be sure, Pete could have done a better job in his\nmotion for an expert of explaining the ways in which the\nexpert would aid his defense. But Pete did identify the issues\nhe hoped the neuropsychologist would address—mitigating\nevidence in the form of an analysis of Pete’s development and\nmaturity since the offenses, as well as the impact\nincarceration had had on him.\n\n    In sum, the critical question under Miller was Pete’s\ncapacity to change after he committed the crimes at the age\nof 16. As to that consideration, whether Pete has changed in\nsome fundamental way since that time, and in what respects,\nis surely key evidence. Under these circumstances, a\nreasonably competent attorney would have found the services\nof the requested expert necessary to provide adequate\nrepresentation at Pete’s resentencing. See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3006A(e)(1). By precluding Pete from developing this\npotential mitigating evidence, the district court abused its\ndiscretion.\n\nB. Prejudice\n\n    We next consider whether Pete has shown by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the refusal to appoint an expert\nprejudiced him. See Rodriguez-Lara, 421 F.3d at 946.\n\f                  UNITED STATES V. PETE                    25\n\n    “[T]he function of the prejudice inquiry is to prevent\nappellate courts from second-guessing district judges in cases\nin which the requested services could not have mattered to the\noutcome.” Id. at 947. But the inquiry is not meant “to force\nthe defendant to prove that the requested expenditure would\nnecessarily have produced a different result.” Id. The\nprejudice question is, instead, whether the defendant\n“requested expert services in furtherance of a claim that\nwould, if meritorious, change the outcome of the case.” Id.\n(emphasis added). In other words, to show prejudice, the\ndefendant requesting services is not required to proffer what\nevidence the expert will develop—or in this case, the actual\nresults of the expert’s examination. To so require would be\nto create a Catch-22, whereby a defendant who cannot afford\nto pay an expert could obtain an expert’s services only by\nproviding precisely the expert evidence he has no funds to\npay for. Accordingly, the defendant need only identify the\nway in which an expert could develop evidence in support of\na claim that would, if proven, materially benefit the defense.\nId. at 946–47.\n\n    For example, United States v. Hartfield, 513 F.2d 254\n(9th Cir. 1975), ruled that the defendant was prejudiced by\nlack of access to an expert whom the defendant requested to\nexamine the defendant’s mental status, hoping that the\nexamination would bear fruit as a defense to the crimes\ncharged. Hartfield did not first have to demonstrate what the\nexpert would have concluded. See id. at 258; United States\nv. Bass, 477 F.2d 723 (9th Cir. 1973).\n\n   Here, the district court’s denial of the neuropsychological\nexpert prevented Pete from developing and presenting\npotentially useful mitigating evidence in line with Miller.\nThe expert could have updated the court as to Pete’s mental\n\f26                UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nstatus, and, depending on his findings, backed up Pete’s and\nhis counsel’s assertions that Pete (1) had changed positively\nduring his time in prison; (2) was susceptible to\nrehabilitation; and (3) either no longer presented a danger to\nthe community or likely would not be a danger at some time\nbefore he was 75. The expert could also have placed Pete’s\nprison record in context, explaining the impact on Pete of\nsegregated housing and harassment by other prisoners.\nParticularly because the district court was skeptical, at best,\nof Pete’s and his counsel’s representations as to these issues,\nDr. Walter’s evaluation was likely the only Miller-related\nevidence that could possibly convince the district court that\nPete deserved leniency. Because Pete “requested expert\nservices in furtherance of a claim that would, if meritorious,\nchange the outcome of the case,” Rodriguez-Lara, 421 F.3d\nat 947, he was prejudiced by not having access to the expert\nhe requested.\n\n    In summary, a reasonable attorney would have considered\nan up-to-date neuropsychological evaluation necessary had\nPete been a nonindigent defendant. And because a current\nevaluation could have provided mitigating evidence in\nsupport of a lesser sentence, Pete was sufficiently prejudiced\nby the failure to appoint a psychological expert before\nresentencing. We therefore vacate Pete’s sentence and\nremand for resentencing.\n\n                             III.\n\n    Pete next challenges the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s\nauthority to enact base offense level 43, which provides no\nsentencing “range.” While 28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(1) delegates\nauthority to the Commission to develop sentencing “ranges,”\nit also requires the Commission to develop Guidelines\n\f                     UNITED STATES V. PETE                          27\n\nconsistent with “all pertinent provisions of title 18, United\nStates Code.” (Emphasis added). Level 43 corresponds to\nthe mandatory minimum sentence of life codified in section\n1111, a provision in title 18 with which the Guidelines must\nbe consistent. See also U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1 & cmt. n.1\n(providing that the base offense level for murder offenses is\n43, consistent with and incorporating section 1111). At least\nwhere a single sentence is compelled by statute, a sentencing\n“range” is properly limited to that sentence. We therefore do\nnot decide whether a “range” is more than one suggested\nsentence where no particular sentence is mandated by statute.\n\n    Pete has not shown the district court erred by calculating\nthe Guidelines’ recommended base offense level as 43.10\nNotably, after conducting that calculation, the district court\ndid not sentence Pete to the Guidelines life sentence, but\ninstead to 708 months.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n     Pete also has not demonstrated that the district court\ncommitted prejudicial error when it considered the PSR’s\ncalculation of criminal history points attributed to his juvenile\noffenses. Even assuming that Pete’s objection to the district\ncourt’s calculation of his criminal history category based on\nhis juvenile offenses was forfeited, as opposed to waived, see\nUnited States v. Alferahin, 433 F.3d 1148, 1154 n.2 (9th Cir.\n2006), and assuming the district court committed plain error\nby attributing criminal history points to three of his juvenile\noffenses (but not to others that resulted in the same juvenile\n“sentence”), id. at 1154; see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), Pete\n\n  10\n     Pete does not argue that Miller compelled the Commission to revise\nbase offense level 43 as it pertains to minors.\n\f28                 UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nhas not shown prejudice as a result of the error, see Alferahin,\n433 F.3d at 1157–58.\n\n     The Guidelines recommend life imprisonment for all\ncriminal history categories at base offense level 43. So, even\nif the district court erroneously calculated the criminal history\ncategory, the Guidelines would recommend the same\nsentence for him. And, because the PSR identified many\njuvenile offenses for which Pete was not given criminal\nhistory points, it is unlikely that eliminating three points for\nthree juvenile offenses would have materially changed the\ncourt’s overall view of Pete’s criminal history, considered\napart from the offense level calculation. It is that overall\nperception, rather than the number of criminal history points,\nthat mattered here, where the criminal history points did not\naffect the base offense level calculation and the court\nimposed a non-Guidelines sentence.\n\n                               V.\n\n    While Pete’s latter two challenges fail, we conclude that\nhe was entitled to the assistance of an expert for resentencing.\nFor that reason, we vacate the 708-month sentence and\nremand, instructing the district court to grant Pete’s motion\nfor expert services, and to resentence Pete after having done\nso.\n\n  SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED FOR\nRESENTENCING.\n\f",

We conclude that it did, and so\nremand for appointment of an expert, and for resentencing\nafter considering any expert evidence offered.

The Crime\n\n    In May 2002, Pete, a Navajo youth who lived on an\nArizona reservation, was riding in a car with three men,\nHoskie James, Harris James (Hoskie’s son1), and Irvin Cepi.\nAt the time, Pete was 16 years old, Hoskie was 41, Harris was\n20, and Cepi was 23. Hoskie drove the car. Pete and Harris\nhad been drinking for some time before meeting up with Cepi\nand Hoskie, and the four riders continued to drink while\ndriving.\n\n   Hoskie pulled over to pick up a hitchhiker, Charlotte\nBrown. After a period of driving, Hoskie stopped the car in\na wooded area and everyone got out. One member of the\ngroup suggested that they rape Brown. They then took turns\nholding her down and raping her.\n\n    After the rapes, everyone got back in the car. The victim\nsat between Pete and Cepi in the back seat, naked, while\nHoskie drove away. Although the exact events and\nchronology are unclear, it appears that either Brown\n\n  1\n    Because Harris and Hoskie James share a surname, we refer to them\nby their first names.\n\f                      UNITED STATES V. PETE                              5\n\nthreatened to call the police, or the group became concerned\nthat she would. As a result, some member of the\ngroup—probably Cepi—suggested killing her.\n\n     Hoskie stopped the car once again, and the victim was\neither ordered or dragged out of the car. She was then\nphysically forced or ordered to the ground. Pete and Harris\nheld Brown down while Cepi, who had retrieved a large rock,\nthrew it onto her head. Brown’s face was bleeding, but she\ncontinued to breathe, making “stuffy nose” sounds. Pete then\nthrew another rock at Brown’s head or face, apparently\nkilling her. Pete asked Harris to “throw [a rock] on her,” but\nHarris said no.\n\n    Pete and Cepi then dragged Brown’s body into a ditch and\ncovered it with rocks. The perpetrators returned to the car\nand drove home. Later, to conceal the crime, Harris and Pete\nset fire to Brown’s clothes and shoes and to their own\nclothing as well.\n\nB. Pre-Trial Events\n\n    After Brown’s remains were discovered, Pete was\narrested. He was held in Navajo tribal custody until a\njuvenile information was filed in the U.S. District Court for\nthe District of Arizona. United States v. Brandon P.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788204\"><a href=\"/opinion/788204/united-states-v-brandon-p-juvenile-male/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 971 (9th Cir. 2004).2 The United States\npetitioned to try Pete as an adult, invoking the transfer\n\n\n\n\n 2\n   Although the record indicates that Pete spells his first name “Branden,”\nhis name was spelled “Brandon” in the case name of earlier iterations of\nthis case.\n\f6                         UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nprovisions of 18 U.S.C. § 5032.3 Id. In preparation for the\ntransfer proceedings, the court granted Pete’s request under\nsection 3006A(e) for a forensic psychiatric evaluation.\n\n    The forensic evaluator, Dr. Herschel D. Rosenzweig,\ninterviewed Pete for three hours in May 2003 and reviewed\na number of case-related materials. Dr. Rosenzweig\ndescribed Pete as “cordial, polite and cooperative throughout\nthe interview,” and as “wholly responsive to all inquiries to\nthe best of his ability.” Pete had “fair vocabulary and [a]\nrelatively poor fund of general information.” Pete’s “first\nlanguage is Navajo” and he “had a long history of learning\ndifficulties, [attending] special education programs while in\nschool.” Pete dropped out of school at the age of 13, in\nseventh grade, when his “level of learning in school was two\nto three years delayed.”\n\n    Pete’s “mother and father were severe alcoholics and\ndrank most of the time.” At the age of 14, Pete began to\ndrink alcohol more regularly than he had before (he didn’t\nremember when he first used alcohol) and began using\nmarijuana; at 15, he started using cocaine. Pete believed he\nwas “quite dependent and addicted to alcohol, and []\n\n\n\n    3\n        Section 5032 provides, in relevant part:\n\n             A juvenile alleged to have committed an act of juvenile\n             delinquency . . . shall not be proceeded against in any\n             court of the United States unless the Attorney General,\n             after investigation, certifies to the appropriate district\n             court of the United States that . . . the offense charged\n             is a crime of violence that is a felony . . . , and that\n             there is a substantial Federal interest in the case or the\n             offense to warrant the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. PETE                        7\n\nacknowledged that [he] ha[d] a serious problem with this\nsubstance.”\n\n    After dropping out of school, Pete lived with various\nfamily members. He worked odd jobs, mostly to earn money\nto buy alcohol and marijuana. Pete described getting into\ntrouble when he used alcohol, but said he didn’t drink while\nliving with his older brother in New Mexico. While living\nwith that brother, Pete studied for his GED and intended to\ncomplete the exam, but his mother urged him to come live\nwith her, back in Arizona, and he did. Pete’s father, who\nphysically abused both Pete and Pete’s mother, died shortly\nbefore Pete committed the crimes underlying this appeal.\n\n    Pete, Dr. Rosenzweig concluded, was a substance abuser\nwho “had virtually no support or help from his family while\nattending school,” and who, “with the exception of one older\nbrother . . . , d[id] not identify any positive role models within\nhis family system.” He “appear[ed] to be a youngster who\nc[ould] be readily intimidated, and influenced by others such\nthat he has little resilience against participating in drug and\nalcohol abuse when in the company of those who are so\ninclined.” “[B]ut when provided with [positive role] models,\nhe appears to be capable of responding in a very appropriate\nmanner.” The doctor noted that Pete was a model prisoner in\nhis ten months at the juvenile facility. According to staff, he\nhad been “an extremely cooperative inmate, had no incidents\nor inappropriate behavior,” and was “polite and cooperative,”\n“essentially . . . a model inmate,” attaining the top of five\nprivilege levels in his time there.\n\n    Dr. Rosenzweig opined, ultimately, that Pete was “a very\nsalvageable young man, and with adequate structure and\nsupport, appropriate treatment resources and abstinence from\n\f8                     UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nsubstance abuse, he ha[d] the potential of becoming a\nresponsible and productive citizen.”\n\n    The district court considered Dr. Rosenzweig’s evaluation\nbut rejected the doctor’s ultimate conclusions, on the ground\nthat the doctor’s opinion was influenced by Pete’s\ninconsistent recitation of the crime and events leading to it.\nThe court then granted the United States’ motion to transfer\nthe case to try Pete as an adult. Brandon P., 387 F.3d at 971.\nWe affirmed the transfer. Id. at 978.\n\nC. Convictions and Initial Sentencing\n\n    Pete’s trial began in October 2005. Harris pled guilty and\ntestified at Pete’s trial.4 United States v. Pete, 277 F. App’x\n730, 733 (9th Cir. 2008). The jury convicted Pete on counts\nof second-degree and felony murder, as well as conspiracy to\nmurder. The judge sentenced him to concurrent mandatory\nterms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole,\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1111.5\n\n   We affirmed the convictions and sentence on all grounds.\nSee Pete, 277 F.

Requests for Resentencing and for an Expert\n\n    In 2013, after the Supreme Court decided Miller, Pete\nmoved for resentencing. The district court granted the\nmotion, noting that Miller requires the court to give a juvenile\noffender “an opportunity to present mitigating evidence to\nsupport a sentence less than life without parole,” and ordering\nthat Pete be resentenced on an open record.6\n\n    Before the resentencing, Pete filed an ex parte motion for\nexpert services pursuant to section 3006A(e),7 requesting that\nMarc Walter, Ph.D., be paid to assist him. Pete explained that\nDr. Walter’s help was “necessary to pursue information that\nmight mitigate or lessen the sentence imposed on\nresentencing.” Noting the passage of more than a decade\nsince preparation of the original PSR and Dr. Rosenzweig’s\nforensic evaluation, Pete explained:\n\n           Dr. Walter would conduct a comprehensive\n           neuropsychological evaluation which would\n\n\n  6\n    The United States agreed before the district court that Miller applies\nretroactively and does not contest its retroactivity on appeal. After this\ncase was argued, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the Miller rule is\nretroactive. See Montgomery v. Louisiana, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Upon finding, after\n           appropriate inquiry in an ex parte proceeding, that the\n           services are necessary and that the person is financially\n           unable to obtain them, the court . . . shall authorize\n           counsel to obtain the services.\n\f10                 UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\n       let us know [Pete’s] ‘mental age’, whether he\n       has any cognitive dysfunction which could\n       make him more suggestible or impair his\n       judgment, and whether he has any particular\n       mental disorders which could have played into\n       his behavior.\n\nFurther, Dr. Walter “could offer insights into the impact\nincarceration has had on Mr. Pete, who has been in\nsegregation much of his confinement.”\n\n      The court denied Pete’s motion. It held that although Pete\nis financially qualified for an expert, he had not shown Dr.\nWalter’s services were “necessary” within the meaning of\nsection 3006A. The court noted that “[t]he purpose of th[e]\nre-sentencing is to allow defendant Pete to present mitigating\nevidence in support of a sentence of less than life without\nparole, in accordance with Miller . . . .” Pete’s “2003\npsychiatric evaluation . . . includes such evidence,” said the\ncourt, and although Pete “implie[d] that the passage of time\nmay impact that evidence, . . . it is difficult to conceive how\n. . . . For example, the passage of time would not change his\n‘family and home environment’ nor the ‘circumstances of the\nunderlying homicide offense.’” “Not only that,” explained\nthe court, “but the 2003 evaluation encompasses the matters\nwhich the neuropsychologist intends to evaluate, rendering a\nsecond evaluation duplicative.” Lastly, “any ‘insights into\nthe impact incarceration has had’ on [Pete] is not the type of\nmitigating evidence which Miller contemplates.”\n\nE. The Pre-Sentence Report (“PSR”)\n\n    In preparation for resentencing, the U.S. Probation Office\ncalculated the offense level for Pete’s crimes as 43.\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. PETE                   11\n\nOriginally, the PSR recommended that three of Pete’s\njuvenile offenses be assigned two criminal history points\neach. The PSR also discussed Pete’s prison record, which\nincluded:\n\n       January 25, 2008, possessing intoxicants;\n       January 29, 2008, possessing a dangerous\n       weapon; March 13, 2008, fighting with\n       another person; May 30, 2008, destroying\n       property over $100; October 24, 2008,\n       refusing to take alcohol test and being in an\n       unauthorized area; March 15, 2009, assault\n       without serious injury, wherein the defendant\n       struck with his shoulder a staff member while\n       in restraints; December 8, 2011, possession of\n       a dangerous weapon; April 17, 2012,\n       interfering with security devices, wherein the\n       defendant burned a hole in the exterior\n       window of his cell; April 22, 2012, setting a\n       fire on the SHU range; June 27, 2012,\n       refusing work/program assignment, wherein\n       the defendant refused to accept a cellmate\n       because he was not willing to accept “just any\n       cellie;” October 31, 2013, destroy property\n       $100 or less.\n\n    The PSR concluded that the Guidelines range for Pete’s\ncrimes was life, and that, pursuant to section 1111, he was\nsubject to two life sentences for the felony murder\nconvictions. The probation officer recommended a life\nsentence because of “the seriousness of the offense and [to]\nprotect the public from further crimes.”\n\f12                 UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\n    Pete objected to the six criminal history points attributed\nto three of his juvenile offenses in the PSR. The calculation\nwas incorrect, he contended, because he never served a\nsentence for those offenses. The probation officer adjusted\nthe calculation to give the offenses one point rather than two,\nbut noted that this did not affect the Guidelines’\nrecommendation of a life sentence.\n\n    Pete also challenged the PSR’s characterization of his\nprison record, pointing out that (1) he had explained the\ncircumstances surrounding each infraction; (2) ten “minor\nincidents in more than seven years is not unusual for an\ninmate confined prior to age 18, and [is] also not unusual for\nan inmate who has been transferred between nine different\ninstitutions”; and (3) “because these incidents came in spurts\nover a relatively short period of time, external stressors most\nlikely prompted” them.\n\nF. Resentencing Proceeding\n\n    At resentencing, the court first reviewed the PSR with the\nparties, asking whether the proper calculation of criminal\nhistory points for Pete’s juvenile offenses had been resolved.\nPete’s attorney confirmed, and the United States agreed, that\nthe issue had been resolved.\n\n    Pete’s counsel, Daniel Drake, then argued. Drake\nreported that he had met with Pete several times in\npreparation for resentencing and was struck by his client’s\ninquisitiveness. Pete was “quite unlike” his teenage self,\nDrake maintained. Pete and Drake had discussed “a number\nof things, interesting things that, again, belie what [Pete] was\nlike when he was 16.” Drake listed Pete’s recent reading\nmaterials, “including Friedrich Nietzche’s[] Beyond Good\n\f                     UNITED STATES V. PETE                           13\n\nand Evil[,] . . . Victor Frankl’s[] Man’s Search For Meaning,\n. . . [and] The Alchemist.” According to Drake, “[t]hese\nthings intrigue [Pete]. I can’t imagine they would have\ncaught his attention at the age of 16.” Referring to the\ncomments of a woman with whom Pete had corresponded\nover the years, Drake summarized, “Mr. Pete is a different\nperson than he was when he committed this offense or when\nhe was sentenced the first time.”\n\n    Drake then discussed the crime, noting that the jury chose\nnot to convict Pete of first-degree murder. He emphasized\nthat Cepi, not Pete, instigated the crime; that Pete was the\nyoungest participant; and that the car’s occupants were\ndrinking heavily. Further, the 2003 evaluation revealed that\nPete’s cognitive processes as a juvenile mirrored those that\nconcerned the justices and underlay the decisions in Miller\nand Roper v. Simmons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137749\"><a href=\"/opinion/137749/roper-v-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005).8\n\n    Drake then reviewed the 18 U.S.C. § 3553 sentencing\nfactors, explaining, among other things, that, were a life\nsentence reimposed, Pete would not be allocated the limited\nrehabilitative services available in prison; that a life sentence\nwas not necessary to protect the public, “given Mr. Pete’s\ngrowth and maturation”; and that deterrence would not be\nserved by a life sentence because of the nature and extent of\ncrime on the Navajo reservation.\n\n    Next, Drake explained that Pete had been in segregation\nfor much of his dozen years in prison and had been\ntransferred many times. His status as a sex offender made\nhim subject to mistreatment by other prisoners. The isolation,\n\n 8\n   Roper held unconstitutional capital punishment imposed on individuals\nwho were under 18 at the time of their crimes.\n\f14                 UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nfrequent transfer, and mistreatment were relevant to Pete’s\nsentence, according to Drake, in two ways. First, they\nindicated that Pete would be affected in an excessively\nnegative way by spending a lifetime in prison, nearly always\nin isolation. Second, Pete’s sex offender status explained at\nleast three of his assaultive infractions. Because of his status,\nother inmates “jumped him,” and he had to fight back in self-\ndefense. Also, he had been placed in a cell with another\ninmate with whom he felt unsafe.\n\n      Pete then personally addressed the court. He thanked the\ncourt for the opportunity to speak; described prison as a\n“rough journey” that had taken a mental and emotional toll on\nhim; and explained that because he had spent 80% of his time\nin solitary confinement, he had done a lot of thinking, with\nthe result that he felt he had “to better [him]self with\nknowledge, wisdom, understanding, and to . . . have goals\n. . . .” When the court asked about Pete’s work toward his\nGED, Pete noted that he had studied and taken pretests, but\nthat his solitary confinement prevented him from progressing\nfurther.\n\n     “[T]he majority of the reason” that he was in solitary\nconfinement, Pete explained, was fear for his life. Being in\nthe “general population . . . , as with my charges, you know,\nit’s political,” and the “majority of penitentiary is run by\ngangs.” But he maintained that he had changed quite a bit.\nHe now had “morals, principles, and a code [he goes] by in\n[his] daily routine, and [he does] his best each and every day\nto meet those goals.” Pete emphasized that he had “changed\na lot,” “matured” and “grown a lot,” that he didn’t “have the\nsame mindframe as [he] had as an adolescent, as a youth, at\nthe age of 16,” and that he now had goals and wanted to do\nsomething positive with his life. Although he wished his\n\f                  UNITED STATES V. PETE                     15\n\ncrimes “didn’t happen,” he couldn’t change the fact that they\nhad.\n\n    The prosecutor then spoke.            Addressing Pete’s\nrepresentation that he had changed, the prosecutor challenged\nthat portrayal: “The defendant says that he has changed, that\nhe has matured. His disciplinary record from the bureau of\nprisons is at odds with that.” The prosecutor noted that Pete\nwas at first housed in the general population but then had to\nbe placed in segregated housing, “because he gets in trouble.”\nFurther, Pete had not made much progress toward his GED,\nhaving participated in fifteen or twenty classes, and then\nwithdrawing in late 2013, which, the prosecutor suggested,\nmeant Pete was not following through on his asserted goals.\n\n    The cruel nature of the crime, the prosecutor continued,\njustified any deviation between Pete’s sentence and those\nimposed on other juveniles. As an example, the prosecutor\nreferred to Pete’s behavior, throwing the rock that probably\nkilled Brown, while Harris refused to participate in stoning\nBrown. Pete’s participation was not due to juvenile\nimpulsivity or poor judgment, discussed in Miller, the\nprosecutor maintained. Overall, said the prosecutor: “I think\nthat that singular act of depravity is just evil. It is not\nexplained by the fact that you were neglected or you drink.”\n\n    The district court then imposed the sentence. The court\nreasoned that Pete’s prison infractions indicated he had not\nmatured. Next, the court discussed the crime, noting that Pete\n“was an active knowing and willing participant,” that Pete\nhad had time to consider whether he wanted to participate,\nbut that he chose to “deliver[] the fatal blow” and dispose of\nBrown’s body and clothing, and that the crime was “one of\nthe most cruel, deliberate, heinous acts I have seen in over 40\n\f16                 UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nyears.”      The court also emphasized that Pete had\n“demonstrated his violence and his antisocial nature while in\njail . . . .” Disagreeing with Dr. Rosenzweig’s ultimate\nprediction about Pete, “particularly when he said . . . he\nthought there was some opportunities for the defendant to\ncorrect himself,” the court announced that any sentence less\nthan life would mean that, “upon release . . . , [Pete] still\nposes a danger, and although they seem to suggest that after\nthe age of 35 people start to diminish their propensity for\ncriminal activity, I am not so sure it is accurate in this case.”\nAlthough it acknowledged Pete’s drinking and family life, the\ncourt opined that, “instead of trying to be better than the\ncircumstances of his parents, [Pete] gave into it, and most of\nthe time he spent as a youth was out of school, drinking,\ndoing drugs, and getting into trouble, and there’s no\nindication that that would go unabated.”\n\n    To calculate the exact sentence, the court reasoned that\nPete’s life expectancy was 75 years. It then subtracted Pete’s\nage and the amount of time he had already served to come to\na sentence of 708 months—59 years—as the total appropriate\nsentence, elaborating:\n\n        That means that you have the opportunity to\n        get out of jail, Mr. Pete, when you are 75\n        years old and live the balance of whatever life\n        you have left back on the reservation.\n\n        By that time, the families will be gone.

We agree with Hernandez that at a\nresentencing, a district court should consider how the passage\nof time, including the defendant’s maturation and personal\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. PETE                        19\n\ndevelopment in the interim, affect such sentencing factors as\nlikelihood of rehabilitation and recidivism.\n\n    In rejecting the motion to appoint an expert, the district\ncourt expressed views inconsistent with that principle. In\nparticular, the district court noted that Pete’s upbringing and\nthe circumstances of the crime have not changed, and\nmaintained that because a psychiatric evaluation had been\ndone in 2003, a second evaluation would be “duplicative.”\n“[I]t is difficult to conceive how,” the district court stated,\n“the passage of time may impact [the psychiatric] evidence”\npresented during the pretrial proceedings nearly ten years\nbefore. Further, the district court held that the impact of\nincarceration on Pete “is not the type of mitigating evidence\nwhich Miller contemplates.” We disagree with the district\ncourt as to all three aspects of its reasoning.\n\n     First, an evaluation for resentencing would not duplicate\nthe 2003 evaluation. The 2003 evaluation did address Pete’s\nfamily and home environment and the circumstances of the\noffense, including the extent of his participation and what\nfamilial and peer pressures may have played a role. Those\nsection 3553 factors have not changed since Pete committed\nthe offense. But his chronological age has changed. Contrary\nto the district court’s assertion that “it is difficult to conceive\nhow” the passage of time mattered with regard to Pete’s\nfamily background and the nature of the crime, the passage of\ntime could affect the degree to which Pete was negatively\naffected by his difficult upbringing, as well as what lessons\nhe had learned, if any, by reflecting on the crime. Indeed,\n“Miller requires a sentencer to consider a juvenile offender’s\nyouth and attendant characteristics before determining that\nlife without parole is a proportionate sentence.” Montgomery,\n136 S. Ct. at 734. Moreover, if contemporary factors relating\n\f20                 UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nto psychological maturation and personal evolution were\ndeveloped, the passage of time could affect the weight given\nto Pete’s family background and the circumstances of the\ncrime in the overall mix of mitigating circumstances.\n\n    Second, an individual’s psychological makeup could\ncertainly change significantly over a ten-year period, both\ncognitively and emotionally. Two psychological evaluations\nten years apart are simply not “duplicative.” Cf. Griffin v.\nJohnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784319\"><a href=\"/opinion/784319/james-e-griffin-jr-v-dan-johnson-superintendent-snake-river/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 965 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding a current\npsychological evaluation “minimally probative” of a\ndefendant’s mental capacity to commit murder eight years\nearlier); Eley v. Bagley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"146448\"><a href=\"/opinion/146448/eley-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">958</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 967 (6th Cir. 2010)\n(concluding that psychiatric evaluations performed nearly ten\nyears after a crime had “virtually no probative value” in\nassessing the defendant’s mental state at the time of the\ncrime).\n\n    The district court’s determination to the contrary was\nseemingly premised on an erroneously narrow temporal\nfocus—that is, on the assumption that only Pete’s mental\nstatus at the time of the crime and during the 2003 transfer\nevaluation is relevant. As we have discussed, however, the\nresentencing should have taken into account—and, indeed, to\nsome degree did take into account—an assessment of the\nrelevant factors, including the prospects for rehabilitation, as\nof the time of the resentencing.\n\n    Moreover, the likelihood of psychological change\nover time is very much heightened when, as here, the\ndefendant was a juvenile both at the time of the crime and at\nthe earlier psychological evaluation. As Miller observed,\n“developments in psychology and brain science continue to\nshow fundamental differences between juvenile and adult\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. PETE                      21\n\nminds—for example, in parts of the brain involved in\nbehavior control.” 132 S. Ct. at 2464 (citation omitted). The\nCourt in Miller also emphasized the specific characteristics of\njuvenile brain development and resulting mental states that\noften cause juveniles’ impulsivity, recklessness, and\nvulnerability to outside pressures. See id. at 2464–65. As a\nresult of these characteristics, juveniles have less control over\ntheir actions, and, critically, greater capacity to change over\ntime so as not to repeat similar behavior, as compared to\nadults. Id. Youth’s “signature qualities are all transient,”\nconcluded Miller. Id. at 2467 (citation omitted).\n\n    Miller also stressed that certain policy rationales\nunderlying hefty punishments—culpability, incapacitation,\nand rehabilitation—differ as applied to juveniles. Id. at\n2464–65. “Miller, then, did more than require a sentencer to\nconsider a juvenile offender’s youth before imposing life\nwithout parole; it established that the penological\njustifications for life without parole collapse in light of ‘the\ndistinctive attributes of youth.’” Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at\n734 (quoting Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2465).\n\n     To account for the transience of youthful characteristics\nand the differing policy considerations applicable to minors,\nMiller mandated that a juvenile offender be “provide[d] some\nmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on\ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.” Id. at 2469\n(citation omitted). Accordingly, although Miller does “not\nforeclose a sentencer’s ability to [impose life imprisonment]\nin homicide cases,” the case does “require [the sentencer] to\ntake into account how children are different, and how those\ndifferences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a\nlifetime in prison.” Id.\n\f22                UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\n    When the district court ruled that no expert testimony was\n“necessary,” it ignored Miller’s reasoning and directives. At\nthe time of resentencing, Pete’s neuropsychological condition\nhad not been evaluated in more than a decade. An updated\nevaluation could have revealed whether Pete was the same\nperson psychologically and behaviorally as he was when he\nwas 16. Rather than being “duplicative,” as the district court\nbelieved, a new evaluation could have shown whether the\nyouthful characteristics that contributed to Pete’s crime had\ndissipated with time, or whether, instead, Pete is the “rare\njuvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable\ncorruption.” Id. at 2469 (citation omitted); see also\nMontgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 733. Similarly, without current\ninformation relating to the policy rationales applicable\nspecifically to juvenile offenders, Pete was hamstrung in\narguing for a more lenient sentence.\n\n    More specifically, the significant mitigating evidence\navailable to Pete at resentencing, other than his own\ntestimony and that of his lawyer (neither of which the district\ncourt credited), would have been information about his\ncurrent mental state—in particular, whether and to what\nextent he had changed since committing the offenses as a\njuvenile. This information was directly related to Pete’s\nprospects for rehabilitation, including whether he continued\nto be a danger to the community, and therefore whether the\nsentence imposed was “sufficient, but not greater than\nnecessary, to comply with the purposes” of sentencing.\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a); see id. (a)(2)(C), (D). Such information\nis pertinent to determining whether, as Miller indicates is\noften the case, Pete’s psychological makeup and prospects for\nbehavior control had improved as he matured, with the\nconsequence that his prospects for rehabilitation and the need\nfor incapacitation had changed.\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. PETE                     23\n\n    The third reason the district court gave for rejecting the\nrequest for funds to conduct a current psychological\nevaluation—that the impact of incarceration “is not the type\nof mitigating evidence [] Miller contemplates”—fares no\nbetter. As it turned out, the United States, and the district\ncourt, emphasized information about Pete’s incarceration at\nthe resentencing hearing, relying on the PSR to conclude that\nPete’s prison record indicated he had not appreciably changed\nor matured in the twelve years since he committed the\noffense. Yet, the district court precluded Pete from\ndeveloping key rebuttal evidence—namely, current evidence\nas to his mental state. The refusal to authorize expert services\nthus assured a lopsided presentation of evidence, favoring the\nUnited States.\n\n    In particular, the court’s refusal to approve a new\npsychological appraisal denied Pete the opportunity to\nrespond effectively to the PSR’s discussion of his prison\nrecord or to provide corroborating evidence that could\nsubstantiate his explanations for his prison infractions. Pete’s\nexplanation for his prison record was that his status as a sex\noffender caused him to be mistreated by other inmates, and\ntherefore resulted in him being placed, indefinitely, in\nsegregated housing. An expert’s testimony could have\nbolstered Pete’s arguments that the infractions, which tended\nto come in spurts over relatively short periods of time,\nreflected external stressors (such as mistreatment by other\ninmates), not some inherent and intractable defect in Pete’s\nmature personality. See Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2464 (citing\n“studies showing that only a relatively small proportion of\nadolescents who engage in illegal activity develop entrenched\npatterns of problem behavior” (citation and internal\nalterations omitted)); Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 733, 734.\nSimilarly, the expert could have opined as to the excessively\n\f24                UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nnegative psychological impact that could result from placing\nPete in segregated housing for many more years, were his\nsentence to remain lengthy. In all these respects, an expert\ncould have provided substantive evidence to support the\nargument that Pete’s prison record did not suggest he lacked\nthe capacity for rehabilitation before the age of 75.\n\n    To be sure, Pete could have done a better job in his\nmotion for an expert of explaining the ways in which the\nexpert would aid his defense. But Pete did identify the issues\nhe hoped the neuropsychologist would address—mitigating\nevidence in the form of an analysis of Pete’s development and\nmaturity since the offenses, as well as the impact\nincarceration had had on him.\n\n    In sum, the critical question under Miller was Pete’s\ncapacity to change after he committed the crimes at the age\nof 16. As to that consideration, whether Pete has changed in\nsome fundamental way since that time, and in what respects,\nis surely key evidence. Under these circumstances, a\nreasonably competent attorney would have found the services\nof the requested expert necessary to provide adequate\nrepresentation at Pete’s resentencing. See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3006A(e)(1). By precluding Pete from developing this\npotential mitigating evidence, the district court abused its\ndiscretion.\n\nB. Prejudice\n\n    We next consider whether Pete has shown by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the refusal to appoint an expert\nprejudiced him. See Rodriguez-Lara, 421 F.3d at 946.\n\f                  UNITED STATES V. PETE                    25\n\n    “[T]he function of the prejudice inquiry is to prevent\nappellate courts from second-guessing district judges in cases\nin which the requested services could not have mattered to the\noutcome.” Id. at 947. But the inquiry is not meant “to force\nthe defendant to prove that the requested expenditure would\nnecessarily have produced a different result.” Id. The\nprejudice question is, instead, whether the defendant\n“requested expert services in furtherance of a claim that\nwould, if meritorious, change the outcome of the case.” Id.\n(emphasis added). In other words, to show prejudice, the\ndefendant requesting services is not required to proffer what\nevidence the expert will develop—or in this case, the actual\nresults of the expert’s examination. To so require would be\nto create a Catch-22, whereby a defendant who cannot afford\nto pay an expert could obtain an expert’s services only by\nproviding precisely the expert evidence he has no funds to\npay for. Accordingly, the defendant need only identify the\nway in which an expert could develop evidence in support of\na claim that would, if proven, materially benefit the defense.\nId. at 946–47.\n\n    For example, United States v. Hartfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"326383\"><a href=\"/opinion/326383/united-states-v-charles-anthony-hartfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(9th Cir. 1975), ruled that the defendant was prejudiced by\nlack of access to an expert whom the defendant requested to\nexamine the defendant’s mental status, hoping that the\nexamination would bear fruit as a defense to the crimes\ncharged. Hartfield did not first have to demonstrate what the\nexpert would have concluded. See id. at 258; United States\nv. Bass, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"310734\"><a href=\"/opinion/310734/united-states-v-robert-theodore-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1973).\n\n   Here, the district court’s denial of the neuropsychological\nexpert prevented Pete from developing and presenting\npotentially useful mitigating evidence in line with Miller.\nThe expert could have updated the court as to Pete’s mental\n\f26                UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nstatus, and, depending on his findings, backed up Pete’s and\nhis counsel’s assertions that Pete (1) had changed positively\nduring his time in prison; (2) was susceptible to\nrehabilitation; and (3) either no longer presented a danger to\nthe community or likely would not be a danger at some time\nbefore he was 75. The expert could also have placed Pete’s\nprison record in context, explaining the impact on Pete of\nsegregated housing and harassment by other prisoners.\nParticularly because the district court was skeptical, at best,\nof Pete’s and his counsel’s representations as to these issues,\nDr. Walter’s evaluation was likely the only Miller-related\nevidence that could possibly convince the district court that\nPete deserved leniency. Because Pete “requested expert\nservices in furtherance of a claim that would, if meritorious,\nchange the outcome of the case,” Rodriguez-Lara, 421 F.3d\nat 947, he was prejudiced by not having access to the expert\nhe requested.\n\n    In summary, a reasonable attorney would have considered\nan up-to-date neuropsychological evaluation necessary had\nPete been a nonindigent defendant. And because a current\nevaluation could have provided mitigating evidence in\nsupport of a lesser sentence, Pete was sufficiently prejudiced\nby the failure to appoint a psychological expert before\nresentencing. We therefore vacate Pete’s sentence and\nremand for resentencing.\n\n                             III.\n\n    Pete next challenges the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s\nauthority to enact base offense level 43, which provides no\nsentencing “range.” While 28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(1) delegates\nauthority to the Commission to develop sentencing “ranges,”\nit also requires the Commission to develop Guidelines\n\f                     UNITED STATES V. PETE                          27\n\nconsistent with “all pertinent provisions of title 18, United\nStates Code.” (Emphasis added). Level 43 corresponds to\nthe mandatory minimum sentence of life codified in section\n1111, a provision in title 18 with which the Guidelines must\nbe consistent. See also U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1 & cmt. n.1\n(providing that the base offense level for murder offenses is\n43, consistent with and incorporating section 1111). At least\nwhere a single sentence is compelled by statute, a sentencing\n“range” is properly limited to that sentence. We therefore do\nnot decide whether a “range” is more than one suggested\nsentence where no particular sentence is mandated by statute.\n\n    Pete has not shown the district court erred by calculating\nthe Guidelines’ recommended base offense level as 43.10\nNotably, after conducting that calculation, the district court\ndid not sentence Pete to the Guidelines life sentence, but\ninstead to 708 months.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n     Pete also has not demonstrated that the district court\ncommitted prejudicial error when it considered the PSR’s\ncalculation of criminal history points attributed to his juvenile\noffenses. Even assuming that Pete’s objection to the district\ncourt’s calculation of his criminal history category based on\nhis juvenile offenses was forfeited, as opposed to waived, see\nUnited States v. Alferahin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792898\"><a href=\"/opinion/792898/united-states-v-osama-musa-alferahin/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1154 n.2 (9th Cir.\n2006), and assuming the district court committed plain error\nby attributing criminal history points to three of his juvenile\noffenses (but not to others that resulted in the same juvenile\n“sentence”), id. at 1154; see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), Pete\n\n  10\n     Pete does not argue that Miller compelled the Commission to revise\nbase offense level 43 as it pertains to minors.\n\f28                 UNITED STATES V. PETE\n\nhas not shown prejudice as a result of the error, see Alferahin,\n433 F.3d at 1157–58.\n\n     The Guidelines recommend life imprisonment for all\ncriminal history categories at base offense level 43. So, even\nif the district court erroneously calculated the criminal history\ncategory, the Guidelines would recommend the same\nsentence for him. And, because the PSR identified many\njuvenile offenses for which Pete was not given criminal\nhistory points, it is unlikely that eliminating three points for\nthree juvenile offenses would have materially changed the\ncourt’s overall view of Pete’s criminal history, considered\napart from the offense level calculation. It is that overall\nperception, rather than the number of criminal history points,\nthat mattered here, where the criminal history points did not\naffect the base offense level calculation and the court\nimposed a non-Guidelines sentence.\n\n                               V.\n\n    While Pete’s latter two challenges fail, we conclude that\nhe was entitled to the assistance of an expert for resentencing.\nFor that reason, we vacate the 708-month sentence and\nremand, instructing the district court to grant Pete’s motion\nfor expert services, and to resentence Pete after having done\nso.\n\n  SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED FOR\nRESENTENCING.\n\f</pre>",
