Day, for appellees.\n\n                  APPEAL from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas\n\nCONNOR, J.\n        {¶ 1} Plaintiff-appellant, Tibercio1 Chapa (\"appellant\" or \"Chapa\"), appeals from a\njudgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment in\nfavor of defendants-appellees, Genpak, LLC, and Mark Ferguson (\"Genpak\" and\n\"Ferguson,\" individually; collectively, \"appellees\"), on appellant's claims alleging race and\nnational origin discrimination, negligent retention and supervision, and hostile working\nenvironment/harassment on the basis of national origin and race. Because we find the\ntrial court did not err in determining there are no genuine issues of material fact\nremaining for trial and appellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we affirm.\n\n\n\n1 Appellant's name was spelled incorrectly upon the filing of the initial complaint. The proper spelling of\n\nappellant's first name is Tiburcio. For purposes of consistency, we use the spelling found in the initial\ncomplaint.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                                        2\n\n\nI. Facts and Procedural Background\n        {¶ 2} Genpak manufactures products made of various types of plastic and paper\nand used in the disposable food service industry. Genpak operates numerous plants,\nincluding one in Columbus, Ohio.\n        {¶ 3} Appellant first began working for Genpak in 2000. Appellant left Genpak in\n2005, but was rehired in 2008 and has continued working there up through the filing of\nthis appeal.     Appellant is Hispanic. Appellant's parents were born in Mexico, but\nappellant was born in the United States and is a United States citizen. During both\nperiods of employment with Genpak, appellant has worked as a machine operator.\n        {¶ 4} Ferguson began employment with Genpak in 1994 and, with the exception\nof a one-month period in 2006, continued to be employed there until July 2011. During\nappellant's initial period of employment with Genpak, Ferguson was employed as a\nproduction supervisor and sometimes supervised appellant. In 2004, Ferguson became a\nquality control supervisor and thereafter did not directly supervise appellant, who did not\nwork in quality control. When appellant returned to employment with Genpak in 2008,\nFerguson was employed as the quality control manager.                   Ferguson did not directly\nsupervise appellant or any of the machine operators.\n        {¶ 5} Scott Wilson (\"Wilson\") is the plant manager at Genpak's Columbus plant.\nWilson has held this position for more than 13 years. Wilson has averred he is the sole\ndecision maker for hiring the production supervisors and knew that appellant was\ninterested in the production supervisor openings that became available but determined\nappellant was not the most qualified applicant for the positions due to his excessive\nabsenteeism, lack of dependability, lack of supervisory experience, and failure to attend\nmanagement classes to compensate for his lack of experience.\n        {¶ 6} On November 10, 2010, appellant filed a complaint against Genpak and\nFerguson, alleging causes of action for discrimination on the basis of race and national\norigin pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4112, a hostile work environment/harassment on the\nbasis of race and national origin pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4112, retaliation,2 and negligent\nsupervision and retention.\n\n\n2Appellant\n         withdrew his claim for retaliation when he filed his memorandum contra appellees' motion for\nsummary judgment on November 17, 2011.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           3\n\n\n       {¶ 7} Appellant's discrimination claim is premised upon Genpak's alleged failure\nto promote him to the position of production supervisor on several occasions due to his\nrace or national origin. Appellant's hostile working environment cause of action is based\nupon claims he was subjected to harassment by Ferguson, which included disparaging\nname-calling, such as \"wetback,\" as well as Ferguson's creation of a \"green card\" and an\n\"Ohio Mexican American Citizen Card\" for appellant. Finally, appellant's claims for\nnegligent retention and negligent supervision are based upon allegations that Genpak\nknew or should have known that Ferguson had a propensity to engage in harassment.\n       {¶ 8} During his first period of employment with Genpak, appellant alleges\nFerguson called him various racially discriminatory and disparaging names. Ferguson\nwas appellant's supervisor until Ferguson was promoted to quality control supervisor in\n2004. For example, appellant alleges that, in 2000, Ferguson referenced a quote from a\nGeorge Lopez show stating appellant was a \"Mexican, not a Mexican't.\"           Appellant\nadmitted he did not report that comment to a supervisor or other management.\n       {¶ 9} During this time, appellant also asserts he applied for a promotion to\nproduction supervisor on more than one occasion, but he was never promoted.            In\n2000/2001, appellant purportedly applied for an open position, but Genpak hired\nanother individual whom appellant claims was a registered sexual offender recently\nreleased from jail. Appellant asserts he was passed over again in 2002 for an individual\nwho was younger than he and who lacked his knowledge of the equipment at the plant.\nAfter being advised that he needed a high school diploma to be a production supervisor,\nappellant returned to school, acquired his diploma, and graduated as the class\nvaledictorian.\n       {¶ 10} Genpak's employee manual contains a no fault absentee policy setting forth\nan employee's obligation to be at work and to be on time. It includes a point system for\nmissed time that constitutes an occurrence. Throughout his first period of employment,\nappellant received nine different warnings for attendance problems.        Appellant was\nsuspended for unexcused absences and also for failing to attend required training classes,\neven after receiving a prior warning for his failure to attend said classes. On June 29,\n2005, after being advised that he was subject to a three-day suspension for failure to\nattend a mandatory make-up training class, appellant crumbled up his suspension notice,\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           4\n\n\ndiscarded it, walked out, and voluntarily quit his employment with Genpak. Sometime\nthereafter, appellant moved to the state of Texas.\n       {¶ 11} In early 2008, appellant moved back to Ohio and contacted Ferguson about\nreturning to work at Genpak. Appellant asked Ferguson to talk to Wilson about rehiring\nhim as a machine operator. In April 2008, appellant began working at Genpak again as a\ntemporary employee. He was rehired as a permanent employee for a machine operator\nposition in June 2008. At that time, Ferguson was the quality control manager and did\nnot supervise any of the machine operators.\n       {¶ 12} Upon his return to Genpak, appellant asserts he again experienced\ndisparaging remarks based upon his race and national origin. In 2008, appellant alleges\nFerguson continued to reiterate the \"Mexican, not a Mexican't\" remark. Additionally,\nFerguson gave him two counterfeit identification cards bearing the Genpak company\nname and displaying appellant's name and picture. One of the cards was an \"Ohio\nMexican American Citizen Card\" which stated it was to be carried at all times. It also bore\nthe words \"0.52 per Mexican.\" The second card was a \"green card,\" which read: \"This\ncard grants access for name mentioned above to citizenship and all rights throughout the\nUnited States of America for 1.5 years.\" See Exhibit No. 1. Appellant interpreted these\ncards (\"green cards\") to mean that Ferguson did not see appellant as \"equal\" to him.\n(Chapa depo., 165.) Appellant testified he did not say anything to Ferguson about the\ncard, but he did show it to former production manager Jerry Paulins (\"Paulins\").\nAppellant described Paulins' reaction as one of \"disbelief,\" but testified he did not know\nwhether or not Paulins confronted Ferguson or did anything about the incident. (Chapa\ndepo., 166.)\n       {¶ 13} Appellant also alleges he and Ferguson were eating Taco Bell in the break\nroom along with several other employees, and Ferguson commented, \"I bet this reminds\n[appellant] of being back at home.\" (Chapa depo., 153.) Appellant did not report this\ncomment to anyone at Genpak.\n       {¶ 14} In 2009, appellant asserts he and Ferguson were watching a training video.\nThe video displayed flat breads that looked like Mexican tortillas. Ferguson commented\nthat the tortillas probably reminded appellant of being at home. Appellant did not tell\nFerguson that he was offended by the comment and did not report the comment to a\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                             5\n\n\nsupervisor or anyone in management. That same year, appellant contends plant manager\nWilson also made a comment regarding appellant's race or national origin. In 2009,\nappellant asked Wilson if appellant's brother could apply for a job at Genpak. In his\ndeposition, appellant testified Wilson remarked it was okay, but he should \"slow down\nbecause we already met our quota,\" implying that there were already enough Hispanics or\nminorities working at Genpak. (Chapa depo., 174-75.) Appellant's brother was ultimately\nhired by Genpak.\n          {¶ 15} Tonya Siders (\"Siders\"), another Genpak employee, asserted that sometime\nbetween September 2009 and July 2010, she was present in the break room when\nFerguson referred to appellant as a \"lazy wetback\" and stated that appellant would never\nbe promoted to a supervisor's position if he (Ferguson) had anything to say about it.\n(Tonya Siders Affidavit, R. 68, Exhibit B.)\n          {¶ 16} In April 2010, appellant attended a training session with his daughter, who\nis light-skinned with light, almost blonde, hair. Ferguson asked appellant's daughter if\nshe was \"hanging out with Uncle JR,3\" implying that she could not biologically be\nappellant's daughter. Appellant did not inform Ferguson that he found the comment to\nbe offensive and did not complain to anyone in management. Also in 2010, Ferguson was\ntalking about a television show known as \"Gangland,\" which portrayed gangs of various\nethnicities, including Hispanic gangs. Ferguson commented that appellant could have\nstarred in Gangland. Paulins, a production manager, was present when the comment was\nmade, but appellant did not report the comment to a supervisor.\n          {¶ 17} During his deposition, appellant was asked if there were additional\ninstances of harassment for which he did not cite specific dates. Appellant answered yes\nand described these instances as \"conversation starters\" in which Ferguson would make\nsome type of joke or remark whenever appellant had contact with him. Appellant testified\nFerguson made remarks like \"what's up burrito?\" or \"what's up Baby Loco?\" (Chapa\ndepo., 199.) Appellant also testified Ferguson made comments that appellant was \"the\nonly Mexican I know that doesn't eat his own food or won't eat his own food.\" (Chapa\n\n\n\n\n3   At Genpak, appellant was known as \"JR\" Chapa.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           6\n\n\ndepo., 200.) Appellant testified these types of remarks or statements were sometimes\nmade on a daily basis. (Chapa depo., 201.)\n       {¶ 18} Appellant testified at his deposition that Ferguson's comments and his use\nof racially derogatory terms often occurred in the presence of managers and supervisors.\nAppellant testified supervisors Daniel Garrett (\"Garrett\") and Steve Halliday (\"Halliday\"),\nas well as production manager Paulins, were sometimes present when Ferguson made\nthese comments, but Garrett and Halliday would treat the comments as a joke and simply\nwalk away without doing anything about them. Following one unspecified/undescribed\nincident, appellant testified Halliday informed appellant he (appellant) would need to\ncontact the corporate office if he wanted to do something about the comments because he\n(Halliday) was not going to get involved in it. However, appellant admitted he never\nasked either Garrett or Halliday to do anything about the comments.\n       {¶ 19} Appellant testified he always told Ferguson that he did not appreciate\nFerguson's remarks. (Chapa depo., 151.) Nevertheless, appellant also testified that he\noften simply walked away.      Genpak has an anti-harassment policy set forth in its\nemployee handbook. The policy directs any employee who has experienced or witnessed\nharassment to notify the plant manager. Appellant admitted he was aware of the policy\nand acknowledged he had attended harassment and diversity training in 2010. Appellant\nalso acknowledged he failed to report many of these incidents to anyone at Genpak.\n       {¶ 20} In addition to the standard exchanges that take place between individuals\nwho are strictly co-workers, appellant and Ferguson had additional interaction with one\nanother. Appellant often visited Ferguson in Ferguson's office. Appellant also loaned\nFerguson some DVDs of television shows he believed Ferguson would enjoy. Appellant\nfurther admitted he invited Ferguson and his family to his home to attend a birthday\nparty for appellant's son.\n       {¶ 21} During his second period of employment, appellant continued to experience\ndisciplinary issues. Appellant received several warnings for unexcused absences, as well\nas two separate three-day suspensions related to unexcused absences. Appellant could\nhave been terminated for attendance problems pursuant to the attendance policy, but\nGenpak allowed him to retroactively use emergency vacation time in order to keep his job.\nAppellant also was suspended for ten days for bringing shotgun shells to work, in\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                              7\n\n\nviolation of Genpak's zero tolerance policy on weapons and workplace violence, to\nexchange with another employee. Appellant acknowledged that he could have been fired\nas a result of this incident as well.\n       {¶ 22} Appellant continued to apply for production supervisor positions when\nopenings became available during his second period of employment with Genpak.\nHowever, he was never promoted. Ferguson averred in an affidavit that he provided\nappellant with tips and advice on how to impress Wilson (the plant manager) in order to\nincrease his odds of getting a promotion. Ferguson advised appellant to improve his\nattendance and to work extra hours when requested. Ferguson also provided appellant\nwith pamphlets about supervisory seminars to attend at Genpak's expense.\n       {¶ 23} Wilson advised appellant that he needed to improve his attendance and\ndependability, as well as gain supervisory experience or develop his supervisory skills, in\norder to better qualify himself for a supervisor position. In his affidavit, Wilson testified\nhis decision not to promote appellant was a result of appellant's lack of supervisory\nexperience, attendance issues, and lack of dependability. Wilson further averred he did\nnot request input from Ferguson as to whether or not appellant should be promoted to a\nproduction supervisor position and Ferguson did not volunteer an opinion.\n       {¶ 24} Appellant swore in an affidavit signed subsequent to his deposition that he\nwas never advised that he was not being promoted due to attendance problems.\nAppellant averred many of his attendance problems were related to complications with\nhis wife's pregnancy due to diabetes and to medical issues suffered by his daughters,\nwhich resulted in emergency room visits and emergency visits to the doctor's office.\nAppellant also averred that Ferguson's comments and his creation of the counterfeit\n\"green cards\" were abusive and harassing and caused him stress on the job. He further\nswore he believed he had to put up with Ferguson's remarks because he was worried\nabout losing his job and needed the income and medical benefits. Appellant did not\ntestify to this in his earlier deposition.\n       {¶ 25} Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on October 17, 2011.\nAppellant filed his memorandum contra on November 17, 2011 and also withdrew his\nretaliation claim. However, on November 14, 2011, the trial court sua sponte struck\nappellees' motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the motion exceeded the\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                             8\n\n\npage limits ordered pursuant to a previous request for leave to exceed the standard 15-\npage limit. The trial court then granted appellees leave to file a motion for summary\njudgment that was in compliance with its earlier order. Appellees filed such a motion for\nsummary judgment on December 12, 2011. Appellant's memorandum contra was re-filed\non December 29, 2011. A reply was filed by appellees on January 24, 2012. The trial\ncourt granted appellees' motion for summary judgment on May 2, 2012, finding there\nwere no genuine issues of material fact remaining and appellees were entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law.\nII. Assignments of Error\n       {¶ 26} In his timely notice of appeal, appellant asserts five assignments of error for\nour review:\n              I. There was sufficient evidence presented to survive dismissal\n              regarding Appellant's hostile working environment claim.\n\n              II. There were genuine issues of fact as to whether a hostile\n              working environment existed.\n\n              III. There was sufficient evidence of pretext presented to\n              survive dismissal regarding Appellant's claim of national\n              origin and/or race discrimination.\n\n              IV. There were genuine issues of material fact regarding\n              Appellant's claim of national origin and/or race\n              discrimination.\n\n              V. The Trial Court erred in granting summary judgment\n              regarding the Appellant's claims of negligent retention and\n              supervision.\n\nIII. Standard of Review\n       {¶ 27} Appellate review of summary judgment motions is de novo. Helton v.\nScioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs., 123 Ohio App.3d 158, 162 (4th Dist.1997). \"When reviewing a\ntrial court's ruling on summary judgment, the court of appeals conducts an independent\nreview of the record and stands in the shoes of the trial court.\" Mergenthal v. Star Bank\nCorp., 122 Ohio App.3d 100, 103 (12th Dist.1997). We must affirm the trial court's\njudgment if any of the grounds raised by the movant at the trial court are found to support\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                              9\n\n\nit, even if the trial court failed to consider those grounds. Coventry Twp. v. Ecker, 101\nOhio App.3d 38, 41-42 (9th Dist.1995).\n       {¶ 28} Summary judgment is proper only when the party moving for summary\njudgment demonstrates that: (1) no genuine issue of material fact exists, (2) the moving\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds could come to\nbut one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion\nfor summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence most\nstrongly construed in that party's favor. Civ.R. 56(C); State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp.\nRelations Bd., 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 183 (1997).\n       {¶ 29} In determining what constitutes a genuine issue of material fact, the court\nmust determine whether the evidence presents \" 'a sufficient disagreement to require\nsubmission to a jury,' \" or whether it is \" 'so one-sided that one party must prevail as a\nmatter of law.' \" Ochsmann v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 10th Dist. No. 02AP-1265, 2003-Ohio-\n4679, ¶ 10, quoting Turner v. Turner, 67 Ohio St.3d 337, 340 (1993), quoting Anderson v.\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52 (1986).\n       {¶ 30} When seeking summary judgment on the ground that the nonmoving party\ncannot prove its case, the moving party bears the initial burden of informing the trial\ncourt of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record that\ndemonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on an essential element of the\nnonmoving party's claims. Dresher v. Burt, 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293 (1996). A moving\nparty does not discharge this initial burden under Civ.R. 56 by simply making a\nconclusory allegation that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. Id.\nRather, the moving party must affirmatively demonstrate by affidavit or other evidence\nallowed by Civ.R. 56(C) that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support its claims.\nId. If the moving party meets this initial burden, then the nonmoving party has a\nreciprocal burden outlined in Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing that there is a\ngenuine issue for trial and, if the nonmoving party does not so respond, summary\njudgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the nonmoving party. Id.\nIV. Law and Analysis\n       {¶ 31} Appellant has set forth five assignments of error in his brief. In his first\nassignment of error, appellant claims there was sufficient evidence presented to support\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                              10\n\n\nhis hostile working environment claim and to defeat appellees' motion for summary\njudgment. In his second assignment of error, appellant submits there are genuine issues\nof fact as to whether or not a hostile working environment existed. Because both of these\nassignments of error address his claim regarding a hostile working environment, we shall\naddress them together.\n       A.     First and Second Assignments of Error – Hostile Working\n              Environment\n\n       {¶ 32} The evidentiary standards applicable in determining a violation of Title VII\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 also apply in determining whether a violation of R.C.\nChapter 4112 has occurred.

The Fourth Element\n       {¶ 34} In looking at the fourth element of the test for a hostile working\nenvironment claim, the court must determine whether the working environment was\nsufficiently hostile, which requires the court to look at all of the circumstances, including:\n(1) the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; (2) its severity; (3) whether it is physically\nthreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether it\nunreasonably interferes with the employee's work performance.

Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81 (1998). If properly applied,\nthese standards will filter out complaints which attack \" 'the ordinary tribulations of the\nworkplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and\noccasional teasing.' \" Id. at 788, quoting B. Lindemann & D. Kadue, Sexual Harassment in\nEmployment Law 175 (1992). Conduct must be extreme to constitute a change in the\nterms and conditions of employment. Id. See also Harter v. Chillicothe Long-Term Care,\nInc., 4th Dist. No. 11CA3277, 2012-Ohio-2464, ¶ 19. In order to constitute actionable\nabusive work environment harassment under Title VII, the conduct is not required to\nseriously affect an employee's psychological well-being or lead the employee to suffer\ninjury. Cerett at ¶ 24, citing Harris at 114.\n                      a. Frequency\n       {¶ 36} First, appellant argues the trial court's determination that the statements\nuttered by Ferguson were made \"frequently\" should have led to the conclusion that a jury\nmust determine whether or not a hostile working environment existed, as the existence of\nfrequent harassment alone is sufficient to find a hostile working environment.         We\ndisagree.\n       {¶ 37} In order to determine whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or\nabusive, courts must look at all of the circumstances, which includes the frequency of the\ndiscriminatory conduct, as well as the severity of the conduct, whether it is physically\nthreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance, and whether it unreasonably\ninterferes with an employee's work performance. Thus, as stated above, frequency is but\none factor for consideration.\n       {¶ 38} Admittedly, pursuant to appellant's assertions, by which he contends he was\nsubjected to routine name-calling, the conduct was indeed somewhat frequent, although\nwe note that the conduct spans a combined period of eight years. In addition, Ferguson\nwas not appellant's supervisor during his second term of employment from 2008 to 2010,\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                          12\n\n\nand the record indicates that appellant and Ferguson were working different shifts at\ntimes during that period.\n      {¶ 39} Nevertheless, appellant cites to the following specific incidents: (1) the\n2000 incident involving the quote from the George Lopez show where Ferguson described\nappellant as a \"Mexican, not a Mexican't\"; (2) the 2008 incident when Ferguson\ncontinued to reiterate the \"Mexican, not a Mexican't\" remark; (3) the 2008 incident\ninvolving the \"green cards\"; (3) the 2008 incident when appellant was eating Taco Bell\nand Ferguson commented that it probably reminded appellant of being back home;\n(4) the 2009 incident involving the training videos displaying flat breads when Ferguson\ncommented those probably reminded appellant of being at home; (5) the 2009 or 2010\nincident in which Ferguson referred to appellant as a \"lazy wetback\" in the presence of\nSiders and stated appellant would never be promoted if Ferguson had anything to do with\nit; (6) the 2010 incident in which Ferguson referred to appellant as \"Uncle JR\" in the\npresence of appellant's daughter, implying she was not biologically his daughter; and\n(7) the 2010 incident where Ferguson was discussing the television show \"Gangland\" and\nremarked that appellant could have starred in the show.\n      {¶ 40} Without citing specific dates or years, appellant further submits he was\nsometimes subjected to racial remarks or statements from Ferguson on a daily basis. This\nname-calling included remarks such as \"what's up burrito?\" or \"what's up Baby Loco?\"\n(Chapa depo., 199.) Ferguson used the \"Mexican, not a Mexican't\" phrase too. Appellant\ndescribed these routine instances as \"conversation starters\" in which Ferguson would\nmake some type of joke or remark whenever appellant had contact with him. Appellant\ntestified Ferguson also made comments that appellant was \"the only Mexican I know that\ndoesn't eat his own food or won't eat his own food.\" (Chapa depo., 200.)\n      {¶ 41} While we agree that the comments were made on a somewhat frequent\nbasis, we do not agree that this, by itself, constitutes a hostile working environment, as\nadditional factors must be considered, along with the environment as a whole. See\nMcGraw v. Pilot Travel Ctrs., L.L.C., 10th Dist. No. 11AP-699, 2012-Ohio-1076, ¶ 27-28\n(whether an environment is hostile must be determined by looking at all of the\ncircumstances; hostile working environment claim failed where the plaintiff did not\npresent evidence that reference to the plaintiff as \"Baby,\" \"Hun,\" or \"Sweetie\" was\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                            13\n\n\nsufficiently severe or humiliating so as to cause psychological harm or unreasonably\ninterfere with the plaintiff's job performance).\n                     b. Severity\n       {¶ 42} Appellant also disputes the trial court's determination that the harassment\nwas not severe, claiming the use of the term \"wetback\" on a single occasion has been\nfound to be sufficient to constitute a hostile working environment. Appellant relies upon\nE.E.O.C. v. Ceisel Masonry, Inc., 594 F. Supp. 2d 1018, 1023 (N.D.Ill.2009) for support.\n       {¶ 43} In assessing whether the conduct complained of is sufficiently severe or\npervasive, the court \" 'must view the work environment as a whole and consider the\ntotality of all the facts and surrounding circumstances, including the effect of all episodes\nof * * * abusive treatment.' \" Tod v. Cincinnati State Technical and Community College,\n10th Dist. No. 10AP-656, 2011-Ohio-2743, ¶ 52, quoting Hampel v. Food Ingredients\nSpecialties, 89 Ohio St.3d 169, 181 (2000), paragraph five of the syllabus. The \"totality of\nthe circumstances\" standard \"precludes the kinds of analysis that carves the work\nenvironment into distinct harassing incidents to be judged each on its own merits.\nInstead, it is essential that the work environment be viewed as a whole, 'keeping in mind\nthat each successive episode has its predecessors, that the impact of the separate incidents\nmay accumulate, and that the work environment created thereby may exceed the sum of\nthe individual episodes.' \" Id. at ¶ 53, quoting Hampel at 181.\n       {¶ 44} \"[T]he required showing of severity or seriousness of the harassing conduct\nvaries inversely with the pervasiveness or frequency of the conduct.\" Hampel at 181,\nquoting Ellison v. Brady, 924 F.2d 872, 878 (9th Cir.1991). \" '[G]reater severity in the\nimpact of harassing behavior requires a lesser degree of pervasiveness in order to reach a\nlevel at which Title VII liability attaches.' \" Hampel at 181, quoting Robinson v.\nJacksonville Shipyards, Inc., 760 F. Supp. 1486, 1524 (M.D.Fla.1991).\n       {¶ 45} In reviewing Ceisel Masonry, which we note is not controlling authority, we\nfind it does not stand for the proposition asserted by appellant. In that case, the court\ndiscussed a case involving the term \"wetback,\" and acknowledged it is \" 'difficult to\nimagine epithets more offensive to someone of Hispanic descent.' \" Ceisel Masonry at\n1023, quoting Cerros v. Steel Technologies, Inc., 398 F.3d 944, 950-51 (7th Cir.2005).\nHowever, the court found that isolated utterances of racial epithets do not create a hostile\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           14\n\n\nworking environment. Id., citing Salvadori v. Franklin School Dist., 293 F.3d 989, 997\n(7th Cir.2002). But, the court did find that a series of such statements could result in a\nhostile work environment. Id. at 1023. See also Cerros at 951 (\"[A] sufficiently severe\nepisode may occur as rarely as once, while a relentless pattern of lesser harassment that\nextends over a long period of time also violates the statute.\"). Futhermore, the court\nrecognized that \"second-hand harassment\" (where the comments are not directed at the\nlistener) is not as severe. Ceisel Masonry at 1023, citing Smith v. Northeastern Illinois\nUniv., 388 F.3d 559, 567 (7th Cir.2004). See also Black v. Zaring Homes, Inc., 104 F.3d\n822, 826 (6th Cir.1997) (comments need not be directed at the plaintiff to constitute\nconduct violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, but this fact contributes to the\nconclusion that the conduct was not severe enough).\n       {¶ 46} In analyzing the severity of the conduct in the case before us, we look to\nSmith v. Glenny Glass Co., S.D. Ohio No. 1:06cv638 (Apr. 20, 2007), for instruction. In\nGlenny Glass, an African-American plaintiff asserted a claim for a racially hostile work\nenvironment based upon seven incidents of conduct which included comments such as\nfrequently comparing the plaintiff's manner of walking to \"picking cotton,\" advising a\ncustomer not to touch a piece of glass containing a wet black glue because the plaintiff was\n\"white when he started,\" and a co-worker's comparison of plaintiff to a black photograph\nthat did not develop properly. The Sixth Circuit noted that while there was no controlling\ncase law on how to determine \"severity,\" common sense would dictate that the comments\nwere \"base [sic], insensitive, and inappropriate.\" However, they could not reasonably be\nperceived as \"severe\" and were not physically threatening.            See also Zacchaeus\n(infrequent comments made on three occasions over a one-week time frame, such as\n\"black South Africans are monkeys,\" while offensive utterances did not rise to the level of\nseverity necessary for an actionable hostile work environment claim).\n       {¶ 47} Here, appellant's deposition testimony and the affidavit of Siders supports a\nfinding that Ferguson called appellant a \"wetback\" on one occasion in the presence of\nSiders but when appellant was not present. Counsel for appellant seems to argue that\nappellant was called a \"wetback\" on a daily basis. Yet, we struggle to interpret appellant's\ndeposition testimony as indicating that the term \"wetback\" was used on a daily basis. This\nstruggle is made more complicated by the fact that appellant frequently failed to cite to\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           15\n\n\nthe places in the record which support his position or to support his factual assertions\nusing evidence in the record. See App.R. 16(A)(6) and (7).\n       {¶ 48} Instead, our reading of the transcript indicates that the use of the term\n\"wetback\" occurred on a single occasion rather than on a daily basis, but that other terms,\nlike \"burrito\" and \"Baby Loco,\" were used on a regular basis, and that the term \"wetback\"\nwas used once outside appellant's presence and relayed to him by Siders. Appellees\nappear to interpret the testimony in this fashion as well. Admittedly however, given the\nrather vague nature of the questioning on re-direct, it is possible that appellant's\ntestimony could be interpreted to mean that the term \"wetback\" was one of the terms\nused on a routine basis, although we believe it unlikely. (Chapa depo., 166-71; 199-201.)\n       {¶ 49} Nevertheless, appellant's testimony also indicated that he and Ferguson\n\"sometimes\" worked the same shift, such as when Ferguson was filling in for another\nsupervisor. (Chapa depo., 201.) This tends to make the conduct less pervasive. Given the\nnumber and context of the specific comments referenced by appellant and the general\nassertions made with respect to the \"routine\" name-calling, and given the testimony\nindicating that Ferguson and appellant only \"sometimes\" worked the same shift, it is\ndifficult to characterize the conduct as pervasive or severe, based upon our analysis of\nother cases asserting a claim for hostile working environment based on race, as shall be\nset forth in more detail below.\n                     c. Physically Threatening or Humiliating\n       {¶ 50} Appellant also argues the trial court erred in determining Ferguson's\nconduct was not physically threatening or humiliating, citing to use of the phrase\n\"wetback\" on a daily basis and the making of the \"green cards\" which purportedly\nquestioned appellant's citizenship and his value as a human being. Appellant contends\nthese acts were humiliating and offensive.\n       {¶ 51} First, we note again that we disagree with appellant's characterization that\nhe was called a \"wetback\" on a daily basis. As stated above, we do not believe the record\nsupports this assertion. Also, the \"wetback\" comment that is supported by the record was\nnot made in appellant's presence, but instead was made to a co-employee. Second, with\nrespect to Ferguson's act of presenting the \"green cards\" to appellant, it is significant to\npoint out that this is one of the only incidents that appellant actually complained about to\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                               16\n\n\na supervisor. Following his complaint, the \"green card\" issue was never raised again,\nalthough appellant testified he did not know if Ferguson was ever confronted by Genpak\nabout the cards.     Admittedly, appellant did testify and aver in his affidavit that he\ninterpreted the \"green cards\" as meaning he was not equal to Ferguson. He further\naverred this was \"like a slap in the face.\" (Chappa Affidavit, ¶ 3, R. 67, Exhibit A.)\nHowever, see Bourini v. Bridgestone/Firestone N. Am. Tire, L.L.C., 136 F.Appx. 747 (6th\nCir.2005) (comments such as referring to a Muslim co-worker as a \"camel jockey\" and\ntelling the co-worker that he might be able to hear better if he got the sand out of his ears\ndid not rise to the \"humiliating\" level of severe conduct required to create an objectively\nhostile work environment). Finally, none of the comments or actions alleged by appellant\ncould be interpreted as physically threatening. As a result, we do not believe the conduct\nat issue rises to the level of being physically threatening or sufficiently humiliating to\nconstitute conduct creating an objectively hostile work environment.\n                      d. Interference with Work Performance\n       {¶ 52} In addition, appellant argues the trial court improperly found interference\nwith work performance was the determining factor in its analysis of appellant's hostile\nwork environment claim, rather than analyzing such interference as but one factor in the\nanalysis. Appellant further asserts the test can be met even if job performance is not\ntangibly affected.   Appellant claims the totality of the circumstances here constitute\nevidence of an adverse affect on the terms and conditions of appellant's employment.\nAppellant submits the trial court should have determined whether or not the terms and\nconditions of employment were affected by Ferguson's offensive conduct and comments.\n       {¶ 53} We disagree with appellant's assertion that the trial court found interference\nwith work performance to be the determining factor in its analysis of this claim. Rather,\nthe trial court's decision reflects that it considered all of the relevant factors in making its\ndetermination. In reviewing the trial court's decision, we find it conducted an in-depth\nanalysis of all of the circumstances to be considered in determining if the conduct at issue\nhad the effect of unreasonably interfering with appellant's work performance or of\ncreating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.\n       {¶ 54} A hostile work environment exists where \"the workplace is permeated with\n'discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult' * * * that is 'sufficiently severe or\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                             17\n\n\npervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive\nworking environment[.]' \" Harris, 510 U.S. 17, at 21, quoting Meritor Savings Bank, FSB\nv. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 67 (1986).\n       {¶ 55} \" '[M]ere utterance of an . . . epithet which engenders offensive feelings in a\nemployee,' does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII.\nConduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive\nwork environment─an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or\nabusive─is beyond Title VII's purview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively\nperceive the environment to be abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the\nconditions of the victim's employment, and there is no Title VII violation.\" Id. at 21-22,\nquoting Meritor Savings at 67.\n                     e. Severe or Pervasive – a Comparison with Other Cases\n       {¶ 56} In analyzing whether the trial court reached the appropriate result, we\nconduct a comparison of this case to other cases asserting a claim for hostile working\nenvironment based on race.\n       {¶ 57} In Glenny Glass, the plaintiff alleged he was subjected to seven instances of\ndisparaging remarks made by Glenny Glass employees or its president over a five-year\nperiod. In addition to the three instances cited above in our analysis of the severity factor,\nthe following additional instances occurred: (1) while lifting a piece of graylite glass 14\n(the darkest commercial glass available), the president said, \"you can lift that glass\nbecause it's black like you. Is that what happened to your wife?\"; (2) the president made\nreference to his grandparents having a black butler who made moonshine in the bathtub;\n(3) in response to a suggestion by a co-worker that they invite the plaintiff to join them on\nvacation, the president said \"why [does plaintiff] need to go to Florida? He's tanned\nenough\"; and (4) the employer received a fax on \"Ebonics\" which the president read aloud\nas he laughed, and plaintiff was offended by many of the statements.\n       {¶ 58} Specifically, the court in Glenny Glass found the frequency of the comments\nwas sporadic, rather than routine, and therefore the frequency factor did not weigh in the\nplaintiff's favor. As to the severity of the alleged comments, the court noted the comments\nwere not alleged to have been made with hostility, aggression, or violence. It noted the\ncomments could not reasonably be perceived as \"severe\" and none of the comments were\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                            18\n\n\nphysically threatening. Furthermore, the court determined that, taken as a whole, the\ncomments did not rise to the level of pervasive or severe and, based upon precedent, did\nnot form the basis of an actionable claim for a hostile work environment. Consequently,\nthe court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n       {¶ 59} In looking at the seven instances of conduct and reaching its determination,\nthe court in Glenny Glass considered various other Sixth Circuit cases as a benchmark.\nSee Jackson v. Quanex Corp., 191 F.3d 647 (6th Cir.1999) (employee was entitled to have\nher hostile work environment claim decided by a jury when her co-workers used racial\nepithets against her, she was the target of false accusations regarding her work\nperformance, and she was subjected to routine and pervasive racial slurs and graffiti\ngenerally directed towards African-Americans); Allen v. Mich. Dept. of Corr., 165 F.3d\n405, 408-09 (6th Cir.1999) (an objectively racially hostile work environment existed\nwhere the employee alleged being skipped over for promotions, received unwarranted\ndisciplinary counseling notices, was told by a manager he was \"lazy like the rest of his\npeople and that is why they are all in prison,\" received a death threat signed KKK which\nincluded a picture of a stick figure with a noose around its neck, and was transferred to an\narea in order to be monitored carefully because \"niggers can't be trusted\"); Moore v.\nKuka Welding Sys., 171 F.3d 1073 (6th Cir.1999) (employee was entitled to present his\nracially hostile work environment claim to a jury when he was subject to numerous and\nfrequent racial slurs and jokes, including \"hey nigger,\" and the supervisor did not address\nit; someone wrote \"kill all niggers\" on the bathroom wall and no action was taken; he was\nasked by a supervisor to drive a fellow white employee who was seated in the backseat;\nand he was subjected to more than one year of supervisor-mandated daily isolation after\nhe filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission); and Jordan\nv. City of Cleveland, 464 F.3d 584 (6th Cir. 2006) (hostile work environment claim\nsupported where city firefighter alleged a plethora of racially offensive jokes and graffiti,\nderogatory comments, isolation, segregation, malicious pranks, disparate treatment,\nadditional duties, and racially motivated transfers during a 15-year period of\nemployment).\n       {¶ 60} We also find the Bourini case to be instructive. In that case, a Muslim\nemployee alleged nine incidents of national origin and religious harassment: (1) a co-\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                                19\n\n\nworker proclaimed, \"I don't want to … see your camel tied to my wheels\"; (2) a co-worker\nreferred to him as a \"camel jockey\"; (3) following the September 11 attacks, a co-worker\nattempted to back over him with a forklift; (4) a co-worker said, \"If it were up to [me],\nthey would…put [plaintiff] in a box and send [him] back to [his] country\"; (5) a co-worker\ntold him, \"If you'd get the sand out of your ears you'll hear me better\"; (6) a co-worker\nimitated plaintiff's voice over the intercom system; (7) someone wrote Islamic slurs on the\nrestroom wall; (8) someone dropped off a Christian pamphlet at the plaintiff's work\nstation entitled, \"For my Muslim Friend\"; and (9) human resources sent an e-mail\nrelating to the plaintiff's immigration status to fellow employees. Upon review, the court\nconcluded the incidents, \"were not sufficiently pervasive to establish an abusive working\nenvironment.\" Id. at 751. Because the incidents occurred over a period of five years, the\ncourt determined they were \"relatively infrequent and isolated incidents\" that were\n\"insufficient to constitute discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of\nemployment.\" Id.\n       {¶ 61} Furthermore, our own court has analyzed a hostile working environment\nclaim in the context of racial harassment and determined the plaintiff failed to\ndemonstrate that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of\nthe plaintiff's work environment. In Zacchaeus, the plaintiff worked for his employer,\nMount Carmel, for less than two months. He testified that while working with the\nharassing co-employee, \"every night something is happen[ing]\" and the conduct was\ncontinuous. Id. The plaintiff alleged the co-employee made comments such as \"black\nSouth Africans are monkeys,\" \"all blacks are on Welfare and on drugs,\" and that she did\nnot like blacks. Id. After his firing, the plaintiff also worked for Mount Carmel through a\ntemporary agency and claimed a second co-employee made a comment to the effect that\n\"why is black children eating chocolate, and isn't that why their face is too black.\" Id.\n       {¶ 62} On appeal, Zacchaeus challenged the trial court's decision granting the\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment on the claim for racial harassment. Upon\nreview, we determined the evidence was insufficient to sustain the claim, finding the\nevidence presented did not meet the standard for conduct that was sufficiently severe or\npervasive to alter the conditions of the plaintiff's work environment. We found the\ncomments, which were made on only three occasions over a one-week timespan, were\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                             20\n\n\n\"infrequent.\"   We further noted the comments were not physically threatening or\nsufficiently humiliating to create a hostile working environment and did not rise to the\nseverity level necessary for an actionable claim.\n                     f. Subjective belief\n       {¶ 63} Finally, appellant argues the trial court erred in finding insufficient evidence\nto support a subjective belief that a hostile work environment existed. Appellant cites to\ntestimony and evidence indicating that Ferguson: (1) called appellant a \"wetback\";\n(2) stated he would interfere in appellant's efforts to obtain a promotion; and (3) created\nthe \"green cards.\" Appellant also testified he needed the job at Genpak to support his\nfamily and he attempted to work a different shift in order to limit contact with Ferguson.\nAppellant asserts the trial court considered other factors, such as the fact that appellant\nreturned to work for Genpak after previously resigning and that relatives of appellant also\ncame to work for Genpak, and improperly weighed the testimony and determined the\ncredibility of appellant. Appellant submits that genuine issues of material fact remain as\nto his subjective belief that a hostile working environment existed. We conclude the trial\ncourt did not err in finding insufficient evidence to support a subjective belief that a\nhostile work environment existed.\n       {¶ 64} To be an actionable hostile working environment claim, the conduct at issue\nmust be severe or pervasive enough to create: (1) an objectively hostile or abusive work\nenvironment, such that a reasonable person would find it to be hostile or abusive, and (2)\na subjectively hostile work environment, such that the victim himself perceived the\nenvironment to be hostile or abusive. Tod at ¶ 52, citing Peterson v. Buckeye Steel\nCasings, 133 Ohio App.3d 715, 723 (10th Dist.1999). \"Both an objective and subjective\ntest must be met; in other words, the conduct must be so severe or pervasive as to\nconstitute a hostile or abusive working environment both to a reasonable person and the\nactual victim.\" Long v. Ford Motor Co., 193 Fed.Appx. 497, 501 (6th Cir.2006), citing\nHarris at 21-22.\n       {¶ 65} Based upon a comparison of this case to other cases involving a hostile\nworking environment based on race, we cannot find that the conduct is so severe or\npervasive as to constitute a hostile or abusive working environment to a reasonable\nperson. Furthermore, based on the evidence presented, we cannot find that appellant\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           21\n\n\nperceived the environment to be hostile or abusive. One additional factor which impacts\nour decision is evidence that a personal relationship existed between appellant and\nFerguson.\n       {¶ 66} Appellant argues the trial court improperly weighed the evidence and\ndetermined the credibility of the witnesses on this issue, given that Ferguson declared the\nworking environment was not hostile, while appellant maintained that it was. Yet, we do\nnot believe that is what the court did. Given the factual circumstances, which appellant\ndoes not dispute, we believe reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion on this\nissue, and that conclusion is adverse to appellant. We further believe it is \"so one-sided\nthat one party must prevail as a matter of law.\" Ochsmann at ¶ 10.\n       {¶ 67} Appellant has not denied that he recommended that four of his siblings\napply for jobs at Genpak. Those four sibilings applied and were subsequently hired.\nAppellant acknowledged that, after leaving Genpak of his own accord in 2005 and living\nout of state for approximately three years, he personally contacted Ferguson in 2008 to\ninquire about returning to work for Genpak. Even though Ferguson was no longer\nappellant's supervisor when appellant returned to Genpak in 2008, appellant has not\ndenied that he frequently hung out in Ferguson's office and talked with him and also\nloaned Ferguson DVDs of television shows he thought Ferguson would enjoy.\nFurthermore, appellant acknowledged he invited Ferguson to his home for a cookout for\nhis son's birthday.\n       {¶ 68} Based upon the foregoing analysis and our comparison of this case to other\ncases asserting a claim for hostile working environment based upon race, we conclude the\ntrial court reached the appropriate result with respect to the question of whether the\nconduct was severe or pervasive. Although the question of whether conduct is severe or\npervasive is \"quintessentially a question of fact,\" other courts, such as the Sixth Circuit,\nhave nevertheless affirmed grants of summary judgment and in a number of cases\ndetermined the alleged conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive as a matter of law.\nSee Chancellor v. Coca-Cola Ents., Inc., 675 F.Supp.2d 771 (S.D.Ohio 2009). In addition,\nalthough appellant claims he believed the environment to be hostile but put up with it\nbecause he needed the job, his conduct indicates otherwise, and no reasonable juror could\nreach the conclusion that appellant subjectively believed he was being harassed by\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                            22\n\n\nFerguson on the basis of race or national origin. Finally, Ferguson's conduct did not\ncreate an objectively hostile work environment.\n       {¶ 69} In conclusion, we find appellant cannot establish his hostile working\nenvironment claim because he has failed to meet the fourth element of the test by\ndemonstrating that the alleged conduct was so severe or pervasive as to create an\nenvironment that was hostile pursuant to both a subjective and objective analysis.\n              2. The Fifth Element\n       {¶ 70} In order to establish a claim for a hostile work environment, appellant is\nalso required to demonstrate employer liability. Upon review, we find appellant cannot\nestablish a basis for employer liability, and thus appellant cannot meet the fifth element of\nthe test.\n       {¶ 71} The requirements for demonstrating employer liability differ, depending on\nwhether the alleged harasser is a supervisor or a co-worker. In Brentlinger v. Highlights\nfor Children, 142 Ohio App.3d 25, 33 (10th Dist.2001), we found:\n              Employer liability for hostile work environment harassment\n              varies depending upon whether the alleged harasser is a\n              supervisor or a co-worker. When the alleged harasser is a\n              supervisor, the employer may be vicariously liable.\n              Burlington [Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth], 524 U.S. at 763-765\n              [1998] * * *. Under this scenario, when harassment by a\n              supervisor with authority over the employee culminates in a\n              tangible employment action against the plaintiff, the employer\n              is subject to vicarious liability and the analysis ends. Id. at\n              763-765 * * *. Where no tangible employment action was\n              taken, but a hostile work environment was created, the\n              employer may avail itself of an affirmative defense to liability.\n              To successfully raise this affirmative defense, an employer\n              must establish two elements by a preponderance of the\n              evidence: first, that the employer exercised reasonable care to\n              prevent and correct properly any * * * harassing behavior, and\n              second, that the plaintiff-employee unreasonably failed to\n              take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities\n              provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\n\n       {¶ 72} We further determined that when the alleged harasser is a co-worker, rather\nthan a supervisor, the employer may be liable to the plaintiff based on its own negligence.\nId. In that circumstance, an employer may be liable for a co-worker's harassment of an\nemployee when the employer knew or should have known of the charged harassment and\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                            23\n\n\nfailed to implement prompt and appropriate action. Id., citing Blankenship v. Parke Care\nCtrs., Inc., 123 F.3d 868, 872-73 (6th Cir.1997). See also Glenny Glass, fn. 6, quoting\nJackson at 659, quoting Davis v. Monsanto Chem. Co., 858 F.2d 345, 349 (6th Cir.1988)\n(employer is vicariously liable for harassment committed by supervisors but liable for co-\nworker harassment only where it \" ' \"tolerated or condoned the situation\" ' \" or \" ' \"knew\nor should have known of the alleged conduct and failed to take prompt remedial\naction.\" ' \").\n        {¶ 73} Recently, in McGraw, we reiterated this concept and emphasized that in\norder to establish a hostile-environment harassment claim, the plaintiff was required to\nshow either that (1) the harassment was committed by a supervisor, or (2) the employer,\nthrough its agents or supervisors, knew or should have known of the harassment and\nfailed to take appropriate and immediate corrective action.        McGraw at ¶ 21, citing\nHampel at 176. We relied upon Sixth Circuit precedent to define \"supervisor\" as \"an\nindividual who 'serves in a supervisory position and exercises significant control over the\nplaintiff's hiring, firing or conditions of employment.' \" McGraw at ¶ 22, quoting Pierce v.\nCommonwealth Life Ins. Co., 40 F.3d 796, 803 (6th Cir.2004). \"An employer is subject to\nvicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created\nby a supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the employee.\nMcGraw at ¶ 22, citing Faragher at 807-08.\n        {¶ 74} The question here is whether Ferguson should be considered a supervisor or\na co-worker in the context of our employer liability analysis. In McGraw, we determined\nthat, although the defendant was a manager, he was not the plaintiff's named supervisor\nand he did not hire and could not fire the plaintiff, although he could direct the plaintiff\non what to do when she was occasionally helping and assisting others with their job tasks.\nWe determined this did not constitute significant control over the conditions of the\nplaintiff's employment, and although the defendant was on a higher level of authority\nthan the plaintiff, the defendant did not have direct control over the plaintiff and only had\nindirect control in limited circumstances. Consequently, we determined the defendant\nwas not appellant's supervisor and the alleged harassment must be analyzed under the co-\nworker harassment standard. We further defined that standard to be one where \"the\ncompany may be held liable for co-worker harassment if its response manifests\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                            24\n\n\nindifference or unreasonableness in light of the facts the employer knew or should have\nknown.\" McGraw at ¶ 24.\n       {¶ 75} The circumstances in the case before us are similar to those in McGraw in\nthat Ferguson was not appellant's supervisor at the time of these alleged incidents and\nthere is no evidence that he had the power to fire appellant or that he could significantly\nchange appellant's conditions of employment. While Ferguson was a supervisor, he was\nnot appellant's designated supervisor.      Therefore, we analyze the issue of employer\nliability under a co-worker liability standard.\n       {¶ 76} A company may be liable for co-worker harassment \"if its response\nmanifests indifference or unreasonableness in light of the facts the employer knew or\nshould have known.\" Id. at ¶ 25. A response is typically considered adequate if it is\nreasonably calculated to stop the harassment. Id. The effectiveness of the response is\nmeasured by whether the steps taken by the employer end the harassment. Id.\n       {¶ 77} In his deposition testimony, appellant acknowledged that he did not report\nmany of the incidents that occurred involving Ferguson. However, appellant argues that\nmanagers and supervisors were present during some of the harassment incidents, and,\ntherefore, Genpak knew or should have known about the harassment.\n       {¶ 78} Appellant testified that he reported the incident involving the \"green cards\"\nto Paulins, and that Paulins' reaction was one of \"disbelief.\" Appellant further testified he\ndid not know whether or not Paulins confronted Ferguson or did anything about the\nincident. However, the \"green cards\" incident was not repeated and no further discussion\nregarding the cards occurred.\n       {¶ 79} Appellant also argues that supervisor Paulins was present for the incident\ninvolving the \"Gangland\" comment, and, therefore, Paulins knew or should have known\nof the harassment and failed to take appropriate corrective action.         Even assuming\nPaulins was present and heard the comment, we have neither an affidavit nor deposition\ntestimony from Paulins, and there is nothing in the record that would indicate Paulins\nhad ever seen the show \"Gangland\" or knew that a comment such as that could be\ninterpreted as racial harassment.      As appellees argue, Paulins' presence during the\nutterance of a comment made about a television show that may not have had widespread\npopularity does not demonstrate that a supervisor was aware of the alleged harassment.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                          25\n\n\n         {¶ 80} In addition, appellant argues that another supervisor, Halliday, was aware\nof Ferguson making harassing remarks, but informed appellant he was not going to get\ninvolved. However, we find that appellant's deposition transcript does not support this\nclaim.\n         {¶ 81} Appellant testified at his deposition that supervisors Garrett and Halliday\nwere sometimes present when Ferguson made comments involving his race and/or\nnational origin.     However, appellant did not provide any details or cite to specific\nincidents when this occurred, other than simply his general comment that these two\nsupervisors were sometimes present. Appellant did testify to a time when Halliday told\nappellant that, if appellant wanted to do something about the comments made by\nFerguson, he (appellant) would have to contact the corporate office himself because\nHalliday was not going to do it. Yet, appellant did not provide any details about the\ncomments that were made at that time.          In fact, a review of appellant's deposition\ntranscript reveals the following exchange:\n               Q. You didn't say anything to [Garrett] or [Halliday] about it,\n               did you?\n\n               ***\n\n               A. Well, to [Halliday] I did. I didn't like how he used to, you\n               know, talk about me and stuff, because with [Halliday] I\n               actually –[Halliday] was the person who gave me – well, he\n               didn't like the way [Ferguson] used to talk about people\n               because he didn't feel that that was right, the way he would –\n               you know, his remarks and stuff towards not just me, but\n               other fellow employees.\n\n               ***\n\n               A. And [Halliday] actually said that that's something you'd\n               have to deal with corporate more than likely.\n\n               Q. Did you ask [Halliday] to do anything about it?\n\n               A. Well, he said he wasn't getting involved in that.\n\n(Emphasis added.) (Chapa depo., at 203-04.)\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           26\n\n\n       {¶ 82} This is not sufficient to establish that the \"comments\" were actually racially\ndisparaging or based upon national origin. It simply establishes that Halliday seemed to\ndislike the way Ferguson talked about people and disliked the remarks that Ferguson\nmade. It does not establish the existence of racial harassment. Furthermore, appellant\nadmitted that he never asked Garrett or Halliday to do anything about the comments or to\ntake any action against Ferguson. Thus, even if there were supervisors who were aware\nthat Ferguson had made some comments to appellant, the specifics of those comments\nare unknown. Moreover, even if these supervisors were aware of these non-descript\ncomments, there is no evidence that appellant asked the supervisors to take action against\nFerguson or that an official complaint was lodged which would alert Genpak to the\nspecific problem. \"Absent knowledge of the conduct, Defendants cannot be liable for\ncoworker harassment.\" Sweezer v. Michigan Dept. of Corr., 6th Cir. No. 99-1644\n(Aug. 11, 2000).\n       {¶ 83} The single incident with the \"green cards\" and the vague comment\nregarding the \"Gangland\" television show do not demonstrate that Genpak knew or\nshould have known that appellant was allegedly subjected to harassment. It cannot be\nsaid that Genpak's response manifested indifference or unreasonableness in light of the\nfacts that it knew or should have known. Therefore, we find appellant cannot meet the\nfifth element of the hostile work environment test.\n       {¶ 84} Because appellant cannot meet either the fourth or the fifth element of the\nhostile work environment racial harassment test, we overrule his first and second\nassignments of error.\n             Third and Fourth Assignments of Error – Race and National\n             Origin Discrimination\n\n       {¶ 85} In his third assignment of error, appellant claims he presented sufficient\nevidence of pretext regarding his claim for race and national origin discrimination, and\ntherefore summary judgment in favor of appellees was improper.               In his fourth\nassignment of error, appellant submits there are genuine issues of material fact remaining\nas to his race and national origin discrimination claim, and therefore it was improper to\ngrant summary judgment to appellees.        Because both of these assignments of error\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                            27\n\n\naddress his cause of action for race and national origin discrimination, we shall address\nthem together.\n              1. Direct Evidence of Discrimination\n       {¶ 86} In presenting these two assignments of error, appellant contends there is\ndirect evidence of discrimination involving his promotion denials on the basis of race\nand/or national origin. Appellant cites to evidence that Ferguson called him a \"wetback\"\nand commented that appellant would not be promoted to a supervisor position if\nFerguson had anything to do with it. Appellant also contends Ferguson had input into the\nselection of supervisors. Appellant asserts these comments from Ferguson constitute\ndirect evidence sufficient to prove appellees possessed racial animus prompting them to\nfail to promote him. Appellant argues that when a supervisor with unlawful\ndiscriminatory intent takes action to cause an adverse employment action, such as a\npromotion denial, the employer can be liable for discrimination, even if that supervisor\nwas not the final decision-maker.\n       {¶ 87} In order to prevail in a case alleging claims of racial discrimination under\nR.C. 4112.02(A), the plaintiff must prove discriminatory intent, which may be established\nwith either direct or indirect methods of proof. Morrissette v. DFS Servs., LLC, 10th Dist.\nNo. 10AP-633, 2011-Ohio-2369, ¶ 12, citing Ricker v. John Deere Ins. Co., 133 Ohio\nApp.3d 759, 766 (10th Dist.1998), discretionary appeal dismissed, 88 Ohio St.3d 1229\n(2000); Veal v. Upreach, LLC, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-192, 2011-Ohio-5406, ¶ 20, 27.\n       {¶ 88} While Ohio courts are not required to apply a federal court interpretation of\nfederal statutes to analogous Ohio statutes, this court has previously looked to federal case\nlaw in considering claims of employment discrimination filed pursuant to the Ohio\nRevised Code. See Morrissette at ¶ 17, citing Coryell v. Bank One Trust Co., N.A., 101\nOhio St.3d 175, 2004-Ohio-723, ¶ 15.\n       {¶ 89} Using the direct evidence standard set forth in Price Waterhouse v.\nHopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), the plaintiff has to produce direct evidence that an\nillegitimate criterion, such as race, played a motivating part in the decision. Carter v.\nRusso Realtors, 10th Dist. No. 00AP-797 (May 22, 2001). Direct evidence is \" 'proof\nwhich speaks directly to the issue, requiring no support by other evidence.' \" Id., quoting\nRandle v. LaSalle Telecommunications, Inc., 697 F.Supp. 1474, 1478 (N.D.Ill.1988). Such\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                            28\n\n\nevidence \" 'directly proves a fact without an inference or presumption; and which, if true,\nconclusively establishes that fact.' \" Id., quoting Randle at 1478. Once the plaintiff\nestablishes this direct evidence, the burden then shifts to the defendant, who must\ndemonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the same decision would have been\nreached absent any discrimination. Id. If the defendant does not meet this standard, the\nplaintiff prevails. Id., citing Randle. The plaintiff has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nto prove that race motivated the defendant's decision. Id.\n        {¶ 90} Discriminatory statements only support a claim for discrimination under\nthe direct evidence standard if there is a causal link or nexus between the discriminatory\nstatement and the prohibited act of discrimination. Id. Vague, ambiguous, or isolated\ncomments cannot be used as direct evidence to establish that an adverse action was\nmotivated by discriminatory intent. Id., citing Tessmer v. Nationwide Life Ins. Co., 10th\nDist. No. 98AP-1278 (Sept. 30, 1999). Furthermore, \"stray remarks in the workplace,\"\n\"statements by nondecisionmakers,\" and \"statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the\ndecisional process itself\" are excluded as direct evidence of discrimination. Id.\n        {¶ 91} \" 'To rise above the level of a stray remark and constitute direct evidence of\ndiscrimination, a remark must:       (1) be made by the decision maker or one whose\nrecommendation is sought by the decision maker; (2) be related to the specific * * *\ndecision challenged; and (3) be made close in time to the decision.' \" Id., quoting Ross v.\nCommunication Workers of Am., Local 1110, S.D.N.Y. No. 91 Civ. 6367 (June 9, 1995).\nSee also Swiggum v. Ameritech Corp., 10th Dist. No. 98AP-1040 (Sept. 30, 1999)\n(comments by co-worker that cannot be linked to the decision maker bringing the adverse\naction do not substantiate a finding of employment discrimination; there is a difference\nbetween comments demonstrating a discriminatory animus in the decision-making\nprocess and stray remarks made by non-decision makers; statements were also remote in\ntime with respect to plaintiff's termination).\n        {¶ 92} In the instant case, we have established that Ferguson was not appellant's\nsupervisor during the second time period that he worked at Genpak, which began in\n2008.    Based upon the affidavit of Wilson, Wilson was the sole decision maker in\ndetermining who was hired for production supervisor positions. Wilson averred he did\nnot ask Ferguson for any input on whether appellant should be promoted and Ferguson\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                                       29\n\n\ndid not volunteer any input on the subject. Wilson also averred he did not consider any\nopinion that Ferguson may have had to be relevant. Appellant does not have any evidence\nto refute this. More importantly, the alleged comments upon which appellant relies were\nmade sometime during Siders' period of employment at Genpak, which ran between\nSeptember 23, 2009 and July 2010. Ferguson was not appellant's supervisor during this\ntime period.      In order to use the comments at issue as direct evidence in his\ndiscrimination case, Ferguson would have to the decision maker in deciding whether or\nnot appellant was promoted or his recommendation would need to be sought by the\ndecision maker, neither of which occurred here. In addition, the comments were not\nmade close in time with respect to the 2000/2001 and 2002 promotion denials.4 Thus,\nthese comments cannot be used as direct evidence.\n                2. Indirect Evidence of Discrimination\n        {¶ 93} Appellant also argues there is indirect evidence of race and/or national\norigin discrimination.\n        {¶ 94} When seeking to establish disparate-treatment discrimination based on race\nby indirect proof, the plaintiff may establish discriminatory intent using the analysis in\nMcDonnell Douglas, as adopted by the Supreme Court of Ohio in Barker v. Scovill, Inc., 6\nOhio St.3d 146 (1983), and recently modified in Coryell. Morrissette at ¶ 12; Veal at ¶ 20.\n        {¶ 95} Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, the plaintiff has the initial\nburden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. Id. at ¶ 21. In the context of a\nclaim for failure to promote, the plaintiff's prima facie case must present evidence\nshowing: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the promotion in\nquestion; (3) he was considered for and denied the promotion; and (4) other individuals\nof similar qualification who were not part of the protected class received the promotion.\nVeal at ¶ 27; Upshaw v. Ford Motor Co., 576 F.3d 576, 584-85 (6th Cir.2009); Grizzell v.\nColumbus Div. of Police, 461 F.3d 711, 719 (6th Cir.2006). See also Hicks v. SSP Am.,\nInc., 490 Fed.Appx. 781, 783 (6th Cir.2012) and White v. Columbus Metro. Hous. Auth.,\n429 F.3d 232, 240 (6th Cir.2005).\n\n\n\n4 The 2000/2001 and 2002 promotion denials are also time-barred, as shall be discussed in our analysis of\n\nappellant's claims asserting there is indirect evidence of racial discrimination.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                             30\n\n\n       {¶ 96} Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the\nemployer to present evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. Veal\nat ¶ 21, citing McDonnell Douglas at 802. If the employer meets this burden, then the\nplaintiff must demonstrate that the reason offered by the employer was not its true\nreason, but rather a pretext for discrimination. Veal at ¶ 21, citing Texas Dept. of\nCommunity Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981).\n       {¶ 97} According to appellant's brief, he is only contesting two promotion denials:\n(1) the 2000/2001 promotion denial in which Richard Hill, without experience running\nGenpak's equipment, received the promotion; and (2) the 2002 promotion denial in\nwhich Brent Gothard, whom appellant believes was younger than he and purportedly not\nknowledgeable about Genpak's equipment, received the promotion. However, appellant\nargues the promotion denials were ongoing through January 2011. Despite the fact that\nthese promotion denials occurred more than six years prior to the filing of appellant's\ncomplaint, appellant argues these claims can be pursued under the \"continuing violation\"\ndoctrine.\n       {¶ 98} \"An action upon * * * a liability created by statute other than a forfeiture or\npenalty * * * shall be brought within six years after the cause thereof accrued.\" Cosgrove\nv. Williamsburg of Cincinnati Mgt. Co., Inc., 70 Ohio St.3d 281, 282 (1994). Therefore,\nany action surrounding the 2000/2001 and 2002 promotion denials is time barred,\nunless the \"continuing violation\" doctrine is applicable and tolls the statute of limitations\nperiod. We find the doctrine is not applicable here.\n       {¶ 99}   Under the \"continuing violation\" theory, which is recognized in Ohio\nAdm.Code 4112-3-01(D)(2), \"[i]n cases of recurring or continuing violations, the filing\nperiod begins to run anew with each new discriminatory act or with each new day of the\ncontinuing violation.\" \"The continuing violation theory has been applied to cases where\n(1) a longstanding and demonstrable policy of discrimination exists, or (2) some evidence\nof present discriminatory activity giving rise to a claim of a continuing violation exists.\"\nOhio Civ. Rights Comm. v. Triangle Real Estate Servs., Inc., 10th Dist. No. 06AP-157,\n2007-Ohio-1809, ¶ 22. Courts have recognized only two narrow exceptions of continuing\nviolations that would toll the running of the statute of limitations: (1) an ongoing series of\ndiscriminatory acts; and (2) a long-standing policy of discrimination. Dendinger v. Ohio,\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           31\n\n\n207 Fed.Appx. 521, 526 (6th Cir.2006), citing Sharpe v. Cureton, 319 F.3d 259, 266-67\n(6th Cir.2003).\n       {¶ 100} In Natl. R.R. Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101 (2002), the United States\nSupreme Court emphasized that the continuing violation doctrine is not applicable to\ndiscrete acts of discrimination, even those that are related to one another, unless it\ninvolves a hostile work environment claim. \"[D]iscrete acts that fall within the statutory\ntime period do not make timely acts that fall outside the time period.\" Id. at 111. One\nexample of the type of act that represents a discrete discriminatory act is the failure to\npromote. Jones v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 9th Dist. No. 21724, 2004-Ohio-2821,\n¶ 15, citing Morgan at 114.     Morgan does not permit application of the continuing\nviolation doctrine to discrete acts of which the plaintiff was aware at the time that they\noccurred and when the plaintiff has failed to present evidence of a long-standing policy of\ndiscrimination. Bell v. The Ohio State Univ., 351 F.3d 240, 247-48 (6th Cir.2003).\nAppellant has failed to present evidence to establish such a long-standing policy of\ndiscrimination here. In addition, because the denial of a promotion is a discrete act,\nmeaning it is easy to identify, the \"continuing violation\" theory is not applicable.\n       {¶ 101} Even if the continuing violation doctrine were applicable, appellant has not\nidentified in his brief the promotion denials that were discriminatory in the six-year time\nperiod prior to the filing of this lawsuit.       Thus, appellant has not identified the\n\"continuing\" violations that would permit inclusion of the 2000/2001 and 2002 claims.\n       {¶ 102} Moreover, even if the claims were not time-barred, appellant cannot\nestablish his denial of promotion claims using indirect evidence.\n       {¶ 103} Without establishing how he has made his prima facie case and without\nsetting forth Genpak's purported nondiscriminatory reasons for failing to promote him or\nthe flaws in its assertions, appellant jumps immediately to the next step in the burden-\nshifting analysis under McDonnell Douglas and claims he has demonstrated pretext with\nrespect to the reasons why he was not promoted when Hill was promoted in 2000/2001.\nAppellant argues this establishes genuine issues of material fact which preclude summary\njudgment.    However, appellant has not presented evidence showing that Genpak's\nasserted reasons for declining to promote him are actually a pretext for race and/or\nnational origin discrimination. Wilson testified his decision not to promote appellant was\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                             32\n\n\ndue to appellant's lack of supervisory experience, his failure to attend management classes\nto compensate for this lack of experience, his attendance problems, and his lack of\ndependability. These are quite arguably valid, legitimate reasons for not promoting\nappellant. Appellant's efforts to offer explanations for his attendance difficulties after the\nfact do not change anything. There is no evidence in the record that these reasons are not\nthe \"real\" reason appellant was not promoted or that discrimination was the \"real\" reason\nhe was not promoted.\n       {¶ 104} Based upon the foregoing, we find appellant has failed to properly present\neither direct or indirect evidence to support his claim for racial discrimination in his\nfailure to promote action.      Accordingly, we overrule appellant's third and fourth\nassignments of error.\n       B.    Fifth Assignment of Error – Negligent Retention & Negligent\n             Supervision\n\n       {¶ 105} Finally, in his fifth assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court\nerred in granting summary judgment on his claims for negligent retention and\nsupervision. Appellant asserts Ferguson subjected him to routine name-calling in the\npresence of managers and supervisors and, given that said supervisors were aware of the\nharassment, appellant argues he has met the elements necessary to establish these claims.\n       {¶ 106} In order to establish a claim for negligent supervision or retention, the\nfollowing elements must be demonstrated: \"(1) the existence of an employment\nrelationship; (2) the employee's incompetence; (3) the employer's actual or constructive\nknowledge of such incompetence; (4) the employer's act or omission causing plaintiff's\ninjuries; and (5) the employer's negligence in hiring or retaining the employee as the\nproximate cause of plaintiff's injuries.\" Peterson at 729, citing Evans v. Ohio State Univ.,\n112 Ohio App.3d 724, 739 (10th Dist.1996). See also Wagner v. Ohio State Univ. Med.\nCtr., 188 Ohio App. 3d 65, 2010-Ohio-2561, ¶ 29 (10th Dist.). The elements of a negligent\nsupervision claim are the same as those for a claim alleging negligent hiring or retention.\nBrowning v. OSHP, 151 Ohio App.3d 798, 2003-Ohio-1108, ¶ 67 (10th Dist.), citing\nHarmon v. GZK, Inc., 2d Dist. No. 18672, 2002-Ohio-545, citing Peterson at 729. The\nforeseeability aspect of a negligent supervision claim is also similar. Browning at ¶ 67.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                             33\n\n\n       {¶ 107} The first element, an employment relationship, has clearly been\nestablished. As for the second element, appellant asserts he has established incompetence\nby demonstrating racial and national origin harassment via Ferguson's routine name-\ncalling in the presence of managers and supervisors, and via the presentation of the\ncounterfeit \"green cards,\" created by Ferguson, to the production manager.\n       {¶ 108} In addressing the second prong, we note that we have already determined\nin our analysis of appellant's first and second assignments of error that appellant has\nfailed to demonstrate harassing behavior on the basis of race and/or national origin\nsufficient to create a hostile work environment. Demonstrating harassing behavior on the\nbasis of race and/or national origin constitutes per se incompetent behavior. See Payton\nv. Receivables Outsourcing, Inc., 163 Ohio App.3d 722, 2005-Ohio-4978, ¶ 42 (8th Dist.)\n(sexually harassing behavior is per se incompetent behavior). Because appellant did not\npresent sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact concerning the\nalleged harassment based upon race and/or national origin, we do not believe appellant\nhas established the required incompetence. Nevertheless, assuming for purposes of this\nparticular analysis that he somehow has, we shall address the third prong of the test.\n       {¶ 109} Appellant claims he has met the third element of the test, arguing Genpak\nhad actual or constructive knowledge of Ferguson's \"incompetence,\" meaning his\npropensity to refer to an employee in a racially disparaging manner and to harass\nemployees.\n       {¶ 110} As stated above, the third element of the test for negligent supervision\nand/or negligent retention is actual or constructive knowledge of the harassment on the\npart of the employer. Appellant claims Genpak's knowledge of the harassment was\npreviously established as a result of: (1) Ferguson's comment calling an African-American\nemployee a \"nigger\"; and (2) the sexual harassment allegations against Ferguson\ninvolving employee Siders, who purportedly claims Ferguson grabbed her face and\nforcibly attempted to kiss her. Appellant contends Genpak failed to take any action\nagainst Ferguson following these incidents (such as termination or, at a minimum, closer\nsupervision), and if it had, Ferguson would not have been able to harass and thus injure\nappellant.   Appellant claims Genpak's knowledge of the harassment has also been\nestablished by: (1) Ferguson's pattern of engaging in routine name-calling in the presence\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                               34\n\n\nof managers and supervisors; and (2) appellant's act of presenting the counterfeit \"green\ncards\" created by Ferguson to Genpak's production manager (Paulins).\n       {¶ 111} Negligent retention and supervision are negligence-based torts which\nrequire proof of the basic elements of negligence: duty, breach, proximate cause, and\ndamages. Abrams v. Worthington, 169 Ohio App.3d 94, 2006-Ohio-5516, ¶ 15 (10th\nDist.). The existence of a duty in a negligent retention case depends on the foreseeability\nof injury to the plaintiff. Id. at ¶ 15, citing Jeffers v. Olexo, 43 Ohio St.3d 140, 142 (1989);\nWagner at ¶ 23. The existence of an employer-employee relationship imposes a duty\nupon the employer to prevent foreseeable injury to others by exercising reasonable care to\nrefrain from employing an incompetent employee. Abrams at ¶ 16.\n       {¶ 112} \"Liability for negligent retention arises because the employer chooses to\nretain an employee who has a history of criminal, tortious, or otherwise dangerous\nconduct about which the employer knew or could have discovered through reasonable\ninvestigation.\" Wagner at ¶ 28, citing Byrd v. Faber, 57 Ohio St.3d 56, 61 (1991). See\nalso Abrams at ¶ 14. \"The test for foreseeability is whether a reasonably prudent person\nwould have anticipated that an injury was likely to result from the performance or\nnonperformance of an act.\" Wagner at ¶ 23, citing Abrams; Menifee v. Ohio Welding\nProds., Inc., 15 Ohio St.3d 75, 77 (1984).\n       {¶ 113} \" 'The foreseeability of a criminal act depends upon the knowledge of the\ndefendant, which must be determined by the totality of the circumstances, and it is only\nwhen the totality of the circumstances are 'somewhat overwhelming' that the defendant\nwill be held liable.' \" Wagner at ¶ 23; Staten v. Ohio Exterminating Co., Inc., 123 Ohio\nApp.3d 526, 530 (10th Dist.1997), quoting Evans at 742, citing Feichtner v. Cleveland, 95\nOhio App.3d 388, 396, (8th Dist.1994).\n       {¶ 114} First, despite such allegations in his reply brief, appellant has not cited to\nanything in the record which demonstrates that Siders made a complaint against\nFerguson for sexual harassment as a result of an attempt to grab her face and forcibly kiss\nher. See App.R. 16(A)(6) and (7) and 16(D). Appellant has failed to point to anything in\nthe record that proves this \"fact\" that he has asserted, aside from the statement he sets\nforth in his reply brief. Factual assertions which are not supported by a citation to the\nrecord should not be considered by the court on appeal.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           35\n\n\n       {¶ 115} Furthermore, in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the\nadverse party must produce the type of evidence admissible pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C),\nwhich shows there is a genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is not entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law. Appellant has failed to point to any evidence admissible\nunder Civ.R. 56(C) upon which the court could rely to support appellant's assertion\nregarding Siders' claim of discrimination and Genpak's knowledge thereof. No such\nadmissible evidence has been produced here.\n       {¶ 116}   To be sure, there is a passing reference in appellant's deposition\nmentioning that Siders had filed a claim against Genpak, but no details were provided\nregarding the allegations or against whom specifically the allegations are directed, other\nthan it involves a discrimination claim. Significantly, there was neither a reference in the\ndeposition testimony to Ferguson, nor an indication of the time period during which this\nalleged discrimination occurred, so it is unknown to us whether any purported incident\ninvolving Siders occurred before or after the incidents involving appellant, or, assuming it\nwas reported to Genpak supervisors, whether such reporting occurred before or after the\nalleged incidents with appellant. Moreover, Siders' affidavit sheds no light on anything\ninvolving her personal allegations. Instead, the affidavit focuses solely upon the comment\nshe purportedly heard Ferguson utter regarding appellant. We note that Siders' affidavit\ndoes state that she was employed at Genpak from September 23, 2009 to July 2010.\n       {¶ 117}   Second, appellant's testimony that Ferguson referred to an African-\nAmerican employee as a \"nigger\" on one occasion in the presence of the production\nmanager when the subject employee was not present does not demonstrate that it was\nforeseeable to Genpak that Ferguson would engage in harassment against appellant based\nupon race and/or national origin.\n       {¶ 118}   Assuming for purposes of this argument that the comment was indeed\nmade in the presence of Paulins and heard by Paulins, it was one racial slur made in\n2008. Although such a comment is extremely inappropriate and offensive, that one\ncomment made under those circumstances does not demonstrate a viable claim for\nnegligent retention and supervision. Ferguson did not have a history of criminal, tortious\nor otherwise dangerous conduct. In fact, there is evidence in the record showing that\nduring the 13 years of Ferguson's 16-year tenure with Genpak that Wilson had been\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                              36\n\n\nemployed as the plant manager, no employee had ever alleged to Wilson that Ferguson\nhad engaged in racial or national origin harassment. Ferguson also averred in an affidavit\nthat, prior to the instant case, no employee had ever accused him, to his knowledge, of\nworkplace harassment or discrimination based upon race or national origin.\n       {¶ 119}     Third, contrary to appellant's assertions, he has not established a pattern\nof routine name-calling in the presence of supervisors and managers.\n       {¶ 120}     As previously noted, appellant testified at his deposition that supervisors\nGarrett and Halliday were sometimes present when Ferguson made comments involving\nhis race and/or national origin. However, as we stated above, aside from a general\ncomment that these two supervisors were sometimes present when Ferguson made\ncomments, appellant did not provide any details about the type of comments being made\nor cite to specific incidents of when this occurred. Again, this is not sufficient to establish\nthat these non-descript \"comments\" were actually racially disparaging or based upon\nnational origin.\n       {¶ 121}     Appellant also testified that production manager Paulins was present\nsometimes when Ferguson made comments.                 However, according to appellant's\ndeposition testimony, there were only two incidents for which Paulins was present and/or\nmade aware of the incident. The first was in 2008 when appellant showed Paulins the\ntwo counterfeit \"green cards.\" The second was in 2010, when appellant testified Paulins\nwas present when Ferguson was talking to appellant about the television show\n\"Gangland\" and commented that appellant could have starred in the show. Appellant\nacknowledged that he did not report the 2010 \"Gangland\" comment to a supervisor or\nanyone else. Consequently, it would seem that appellant did not ask Paulins to take\naction against Ferguson for this comment or make a formal complaint.\n       {¶ 122}     While arguably offensive and/or demeaning, these incidents, which span\na period of two to three years, do not constitute routine name-calling in the presence of\nsupervisors and managers by which a reasonably prudent person would have anticipated\nthat an injury was likely to result. As previously stated, the \"Gangland\" comment was\nvague, and it is unclear whether or not Paulins knew anything about the show or\nunderstood what appellant purports Ferguson was implying by referencing the show.\nAnd, although the incident involving the \"green cards\" was offensive and demeaning, this\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           37\n\n\nincident occurred only one time. Appellant did, in fact, complain about this particular\nincident and, following said complaint, the \"green cards\" were never presented again.\nAppellant also testified he did not know if Paulins or another Genpak supervisor or\nmanager ever addressed the issue with Ferguson. Thus, it is unknown whether or not\nGenpak intervened or took any action to prevent a recurrence of the behavior in the\nworkplace, but the evidence shows that these particular cards were never used again.\n         {¶ 123}   In conclusion, the totality of the circumstances at issue are not\n\"somewhat overwhelming\" and it cannot be said that a reasonably prudent person would\nanticipate that an injury was likely to result by way of Ferguson's conduct, based upon\nthese circumstances. The prior behavior was legally insufficient to establish foreseeability\nfor the purpose of appellant's negligent hiring and negligent retention claims. This court\nhas previously required much more in order for there to be an issue as to whether the\nbehavior was foreseeable. See, e.g., Wagner (physician with known chemical impairment\nissues and practicing under a consent agreement with the state had his medical license\nsuspended and his clinical contract and privileges terminated by employer hospital;\nphysician was known to have manipulated a former patient's pain pump to divert drugs to\nhimself; genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether hospital should have\nreasonably foreseen the consequence of its decision to retain physician in a\nfaculty/researcher position when physician harmed two former patients under the guise\nof conducting \"research\" by siphoning morphine from their pain pumps).\n         {¶ 124} Based upon Ferguson's history and the information which was known or\nshould have been known to Genpak, it was not foreseeable, using a totality of the\ncircumstances analysis, that Ferguson would allegedly injure appellant.          Therefore,\nappellant cannot establish the third element of his negligent retention and negligent\nsupervision claims. Consequently, because appellant has not established that Genpak had\nprior knowledge of Ferguson's incompetence, appellant cannot establish the fourth\nelement (Genpak's act or omission caused appellant's injuries) or the fifth element\n(Genpak's negligence was the proximate cause of appellant's injuries). Because we find\nthe trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on appellant's negligent\nretention and negligent supervision claims, we overrule appellant's fifth assignment of\nerror.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                        38\n\n\nV. Disposition\n      {¶ 125} In conclusion, we overrule all five assignments of error presented by\nappellant. The judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n                                                                  Judgment affirmed.\n                             KLATT and DORRIAN, JJ., concur.\n                                   ________________\n\f",

Because we find the\ntrial court did not err in determining there are no genuine issues of material fact\nremaining for trial and appellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we affirm.\n\n\n\n1 Appellant's name was spelled incorrectly upon the filing of the initial complaint. The proper spelling of\n\nappellant's first name is Tiburcio. For purposes of consistency, we use the spelling found in the initial\ncomplaint.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                                        2\n\n\nI. Facts and Procedural Background\n        {¶ 2} Genpak manufactures products made of various types of plastic and paper\nand used in the disposable food service industry. Genpak operates numerous plants,\nincluding one in Columbus, Ohio.\n        {¶ 3} Appellant first began working for Genpak in 2000. Appellant left Genpak in\n2005, but was rehired in 2008 and has continued working there up through the filing of\nthis appeal.     Appellant is Hispanic. Appellant's parents were born in Mexico, but\nappellant was born in the United States and is a United States citizen. During both\nperiods of employment with Genpak, appellant has worked as a machine operator.\n        {¶ 4} Ferguson began employment with Genpak in 1994 and, with the exception\nof a one-month period in 2006, continued to be employed there until July 2011. During\nappellant's initial period of employment with Genpak, Ferguson was employed as a\nproduction supervisor and sometimes supervised appellant. In 2004, Ferguson became a\nquality control supervisor and thereafter did not directly supervise appellant, who did not\nwork in quality control. When appellant returned to employment with Genpak in 2008,\nFerguson was employed as the quality control manager.                   Ferguson did not directly\nsupervise appellant or any of the machine operators.\n        {¶ 5} Scott Wilson (\"Wilson\") is the plant manager at Genpak's Columbus plant.\nWilson has held this position for more than 13 years. Wilson has averred he is the sole\ndecision maker for hiring the production supervisors and knew that appellant was\ninterested in the production supervisor openings that became available but determined\nappellant was not the most qualified applicant for the positions due to his excessive\nabsenteeism, lack of dependability, lack of supervisory experience, and failure to attend\nmanagement classes to compensate for his lack of experience.\n        {¶ 6} On November 10, 2010, appellant filed a complaint against Genpak and\nFerguson, alleging causes of action for discrimination on the basis of race and national\norigin pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4112, a hostile work environment/harassment on the\nbasis of race and national origin pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4112, retaliation,2 and negligent\nsupervision and retention.\n\n\n2Appellant\n         withdrew his claim for retaliation when he filed his memorandum contra appellees' motion for\nsummary judgment on November 17, 2011.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           3\n\n\n       {¶ 7} Appellant's discrimination claim is premised upon Genpak's alleged failure\nto promote him to the position of production supervisor on several occasions due to his\nrace or national origin. Appellant's hostile working environment cause of action is based\nupon claims he was subjected to harassment by Ferguson, which included disparaging\nname-calling, such as \"wetback,\" as well as Ferguson's creation of a \"green card\" and an\n\"Ohio Mexican American Citizen Card\" for appellant. Finally, appellant's claims for\nnegligent retention and negligent supervision are based upon allegations that Genpak\nknew or should have known that Ferguson had a propensity to engage in harassment.\n       {¶ 8} During his first period of employment with Genpak, appellant alleges\nFerguson called him various racially discriminatory and disparaging names. Ferguson\nwas appellant's supervisor until Ferguson was promoted to quality control supervisor in\n2004. For example, appellant alleges that, in 2000, Ferguson referenced a quote from a\nGeorge Lopez show stating appellant was a \"Mexican, not a Mexican't.\"           Appellant\nadmitted he did not report that comment to a supervisor or other management.\n       {¶ 9} During this time, appellant also asserts he applied for a promotion to\nproduction supervisor on more than one occasion, but he was never promoted.            In\n2000/2001, appellant purportedly applied for an open position, but Genpak hired\nanother individual whom appellant claims was a registered sexual offender recently\nreleased from jail. Appellant asserts he was passed over again in 2002 for an individual\nwho was younger than he and who lacked his knowledge of the equipment at the plant.\nAfter being advised that he needed a high school diploma to be a production supervisor,\nappellant returned to school, acquired his diploma, and graduated as the class\nvaledictorian.\n       {¶ 10} Genpak's employee manual contains a no fault absentee policy setting forth\nan employee's obligation to be at work and to be on time. It includes a point system for\nmissed time that constitutes an occurrence. Throughout his first period of employment,\nappellant received nine different warnings for attendance problems.        Appellant was\nsuspended for unexcused absences and also for failing to attend required training classes,\neven after receiving a prior warning for his failure to attend said classes. On June 29,\n2005, after being advised that he was subject to a three-day suspension for failure to\nattend a mandatory make-up training class, appellant crumbled up his suspension notice,\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           4\n\n\ndiscarded it, walked out, and voluntarily quit his employment with Genpak. Sometime\nthereafter, appellant moved to the state of Texas.\n       {¶ 11} In early 2008, appellant moved back to Ohio and contacted Ferguson about\nreturning to work at Genpak. Appellant asked Ferguson to talk to Wilson about rehiring\nhim as a machine operator. In April 2008, appellant began working at Genpak again as a\ntemporary employee. He was rehired as a permanent employee for a machine operator\nposition in June 2008. At that time, Ferguson was the quality control manager and did\nnot supervise any of the machine operators.\n       {¶ 12} Upon his return to Genpak, appellant asserts he again experienced\ndisparaging remarks based upon his race and national origin. In 2008, appellant alleges\nFerguson continued to reiterate the \"Mexican, not a Mexican't\" remark. Additionally,\nFerguson gave him two counterfeit identification cards bearing the Genpak company\nname and displaying appellant's name and picture. One of the cards was an \"Ohio\nMexican American Citizen Card\" which stated it was to be carried at all times. It also bore\nthe words \"0.52 per Mexican.\" The second card was a \"green card,\" which read: \"This\ncard grants access for name mentioned above to citizenship and all rights throughout the\nUnited States of America for 1.5 years.\" See Exhibit No. 1. Appellant interpreted these\ncards (\"green cards\") to mean that Ferguson did not see appellant as \"equal\" to him.\n(Chapa depo., 165.) Appellant testified he did not say anything to Ferguson about the\ncard, but he did show it to former production manager Jerry Paulins (\"Paulins\").\nAppellant described Paulins' reaction as one of \"disbelief,\" but testified he did not know\nwhether or not Paulins confronted Ferguson or did anything about the incident. (Chapa\ndepo., 166.)\n       {¶ 13} Appellant also alleges he and Ferguson were eating Taco Bell in the break\nroom along with several other employees, and Ferguson commented, \"I bet this reminds\n[appellant] of being back at home.\" (Chapa depo., 153.) Appellant did not report this\ncomment to anyone at Genpak.\n       {¶ 14} In 2009, appellant asserts he and Ferguson were watching a training video.\nThe video displayed flat breads that looked like Mexican tortillas. Ferguson commented\nthat the tortillas probably reminded appellant of being at home. Appellant did not tell\nFerguson that he was offended by the comment and did not report the comment to a\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                             5\n\n\nsupervisor or anyone in management. That same year, appellant contends plant manager\nWilson also made a comment regarding appellant's race or national origin. In 2009,\nappellant asked Wilson if appellant's brother could apply for a job at Genpak. In his\ndeposition, appellant testified Wilson remarked it was okay, but he should \"slow down\nbecause we already met our quota,\" implying that there were already enough Hispanics or\nminorities working at Genpak. (Chapa depo., 174-75.) Appellant's brother was ultimately\nhired by Genpak.\n          {¶ 15} Tonya Siders (\"Siders\"), another Genpak employee, asserted that sometime\nbetween September 2009 and July 2010, she was present in the break room when\nFerguson referred to appellant as a \"lazy wetback\" and stated that appellant would never\nbe promoted to a supervisor's position if he (Ferguson) had anything to say about it.\n(Tonya Siders Affidavit, R. 68, Exhibit B.)\n          {¶ 16} In April 2010, appellant attended a training session with his daughter, who\nis light-skinned with light, almost blonde, hair. Ferguson asked appellant's daughter if\nshe was \"hanging out with Uncle JR,3\" implying that she could not biologically be\nappellant's daughter. Appellant did not inform Ferguson that he found the comment to\nbe offensive and did not complain to anyone in management. Also in 2010, Ferguson was\ntalking about a television show known as \"Gangland,\" which portrayed gangs of various\nethnicities, including Hispanic gangs. Ferguson commented that appellant could have\nstarred in Gangland. Paulins, a production manager, was present when the comment was\nmade, but appellant did not report the comment to a supervisor.\n          {¶ 17} During his deposition, appellant was asked if there were additional\ninstances of harassment for which he did not cite specific dates. Appellant answered yes\nand described these instances as \"conversation starters\" in which Ferguson would make\nsome type of joke or remark whenever appellant had contact with him. Appellant testified\nFerguson made remarks like \"what's up burrito?\" or \"what's up Baby Loco?\" (Chapa\ndepo., 199.) Appellant also testified Ferguson made comments that appellant was \"the\nonly Mexican I know that doesn't eat his own food or won't eat his own food.\" (Chapa\n\n\n\n\n3   At Genpak, appellant was known as \"JR\" Chapa.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           6\n\n\ndepo., 200.) Appellant testified these types of remarks or statements were sometimes\nmade on a daily basis. (Chapa depo., 201.)\n       {¶ 18} Appellant testified at his deposition that Ferguson's comments and his use\nof racially derogatory terms often occurred in the presence of managers and supervisors.\nAppellant testified supervisors Daniel Garrett (\"Garrett\") and Steve Halliday (\"Halliday\"),\nas well as production manager Paulins, were sometimes present when Ferguson made\nthese comments, but Garrett and Halliday would treat the comments as a joke and simply\nwalk away without doing anything about them. Following one unspecified/undescribed\nincident, appellant testified Halliday informed appellant he (appellant) would need to\ncontact the corporate office if he wanted to do something about the comments because he\n(Halliday) was not going to get involved in it. However, appellant admitted he never\nasked either Garrett or Halliday to do anything about the comments.\n       {¶ 19} Appellant testified he always told Ferguson that he did not appreciate\nFerguson's remarks. (Chapa depo., 151.) Nevertheless, appellant also testified that he\noften simply walked away.      Genpak has an anti-harassment policy set forth in its\nemployee handbook. The policy directs any employee who has experienced or witnessed\nharassment to notify the plant manager. Appellant admitted he was aware of the policy\nand acknowledged he had attended harassment and diversity training in 2010. Appellant\nalso acknowledged he failed to report many of these incidents to anyone at Genpak.\n       {¶ 20} In addition to the standard exchanges that take place between individuals\nwho are strictly co-workers, appellant and Ferguson had additional interaction with one\nanother. Appellant often visited Ferguson in Ferguson's office. Appellant also loaned\nFerguson some DVDs of television shows he believed Ferguson would enjoy. Appellant\nfurther admitted he invited Ferguson and his family to his home to attend a birthday\nparty for appellant's son.\n       {¶ 21} During his second period of employment, appellant continued to experience\ndisciplinary issues. Appellant received several warnings for unexcused absences, as well\nas two separate three-day suspensions related to unexcused absences. Appellant could\nhave been terminated for attendance problems pursuant to the attendance policy, but\nGenpak allowed him to retroactively use emergency vacation time in order to keep his job.\nAppellant also was suspended for ten days for bringing shotgun shells to work, in\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                              7\n\n\nviolation of Genpak's zero tolerance policy on weapons and workplace violence, to\nexchange with another employee. Appellant acknowledged that he could have been fired\nas a result of this incident as well.\n       {¶ 22} Appellant continued to apply for production supervisor positions when\nopenings became available during his second period of employment with Genpak.\nHowever, he was never promoted. Ferguson averred in an affidavit that he provided\nappellant with tips and advice on how to impress Wilson (the plant manager) in order to\nincrease his odds of getting a promotion. Ferguson advised appellant to improve his\nattendance and to work extra hours when requested. Ferguson also provided appellant\nwith pamphlets about supervisory seminars to attend at Genpak's expense.\n       {¶ 23} Wilson advised appellant that he needed to improve his attendance and\ndependability, as well as gain supervisory experience or develop his supervisory skills, in\norder to better qualify himself for a supervisor position. In his affidavit, Wilson testified\nhis decision not to promote appellant was a result of appellant's lack of supervisory\nexperience, attendance issues, and lack of dependability. Wilson further averred he did\nnot request input from Ferguson as to whether or not appellant should be promoted to a\nproduction supervisor position and Ferguson did not volunteer an opinion.\n       {¶ 24} Appellant swore in an affidavit signed subsequent to his deposition that he\nwas never advised that he was not being promoted due to attendance problems.\nAppellant averred many of his attendance problems were related to complications with\nhis wife's pregnancy due to diabetes and to medical issues suffered by his daughters,\nwhich resulted in emergency room visits and emergency visits to the doctor's office.\nAppellant also averred that Ferguson's comments and his creation of the counterfeit\n\"green cards\" were abusive and harassing and caused him stress on the job. He further\nswore he believed he had to put up with Ferguson's remarks because he was worried\nabout losing his job and needed the income and medical benefits. Appellant did not\ntestify to this in his earlier deposition.\n       {¶ 25} Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on October 17, 2011.\nAppellant filed his memorandum contra on November 17, 2011 and also withdrew his\nretaliation claim. However, on November 14, 2011, the trial court sua sponte struck\nappellees' motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the motion exceeded the\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                             8\n\n\npage limits ordered pursuant to a previous request for leave to exceed the standard 15-\npage limit. The trial court then granted appellees leave to file a motion for summary\njudgment that was in compliance with its earlier order. Appellees filed such a motion for\nsummary judgment on December 12, 2011. Appellant's memorandum contra was re-filed\non December 29, 2011. A reply was filed by appellees on January 24, 2012. The trial\ncourt granted appellees' motion for summary judgment on May 2, 2012, finding there\nwere no genuine issues of material fact remaining and appellees were entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law.\nII. Assignments of Error\n       {¶ 26} In his timely notice of appeal, appellant asserts five assignments of error for\nour review:\n              I. There was sufficient evidence presented to survive dismissal\n              regarding Appellant's hostile working environment claim.\n\n              II. There were genuine issues of fact as to whether a hostile\n              working environment existed.\n\n              III. There was sufficient evidence of pretext presented to\n              survive dismissal regarding Appellant's claim of national\n              origin and/or race discrimination.\n\n              IV. There were genuine issues of material fact regarding\n              Appellant's claim of national origin and/or race\n              discrimination.\n\n              V. The Trial Court erred in granting summary judgment\n              regarding the Appellant's claims of negligent retention and\n              supervision.\n\nIII.

A moving\nparty does not discharge this initial burden under Civ.R. 56 by simply making a\nconclusory allegation that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. Id.\nRather, the moving party must affirmatively demonstrate by affidavit or other evidence\nallowed by Civ.R. 56(C) that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support its claims.\nId. If the moving party meets this initial burden, then the nonmoving party has a\nreciprocal burden outlined in Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing that there is a\ngenuine issue for trial and, if the nonmoving party does not so respond, summary\njudgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the nonmoving party. Id.\nIV. Law and Analysis\n       {¶ 31} Appellant has set forth five assignments of error in his brief. In his first\nassignment of error, appellant claims there was sufficient evidence presented to support\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                              10\n\n\nhis hostile working environment claim and to defeat appellees' motion for summary\njudgment. In his second assignment of error, appellant submits there are genuine issues\nof fact as to whether or not a hostile working environment existed. Because both of these\nassignments of error address his claim regarding a hostile working environment, we shall\naddress them together.\n       A.

The Fourth Element\n       {¶ 34} In looking at the fourth element of the test for a hostile working\nenvironment claim, the court must determine whether the working environment was\nsufficiently hostile, which requires the court to look at all of the circumstances, including:\n(1) the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; (2) its severity; (3) whether it is physically\nthreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether it\nunreasonably interferes with the employee's work performance.

Chillicothe Long-Term Care,\nInc., 4th Dist. No. 11CA3277, 2012-Ohio-2464, ¶ 19. In order to constitute actionable\nabusive work environment harassment under Title VII, the conduct is not required to\nseriously affect an employee's psychological well-being or lead the employee to suffer\ninjury. Cerett at ¶ 24, citing Harris at 114.\n                      a. Frequency\n       {¶ 36} First, appellant argues the trial court's determination that the statements\nuttered by Ferguson were made \"frequently\" should have led to the conclusion that a jury\nmust determine whether or not a hostile working environment existed, as the existence of\nfrequent harassment alone is sufficient to find a hostile working environment.         We\ndisagree.\n       {¶ 37} In order to determine whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or\nabusive, courts must look at all of the circumstances, which includes the frequency of the\ndiscriminatory conduct, as well as the severity of the conduct, whether it is physically\nthreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance, and whether it unreasonably\ninterferes with an employee's work performance. Thus, as stated above, frequency is but\none factor for consideration.\n       {¶ 38} Admittedly, pursuant to appellant's assertions, by which he contends he was\nsubjected to routine name-calling, the conduct was indeed somewhat frequent, although\nwe note that the conduct spans a combined period of eight years. In addition, Ferguson\nwas not appellant's supervisor during his second term of employment from 2008 to 2010,\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                          12\n\n\nand the record indicates that appellant and Ferguson were working different shifts at\ntimes during that period.\n      {¶ 39} Nevertheless, appellant cites to the following specific incidents: (1) the\n2000 incident involving the quote from the George Lopez show where Ferguson described\nappellant as a \"Mexican, not a Mexican't\"; (2) the 2008 incident when Ferguson\ncontinued to reiterate the \"Mexican, not a Mexican't\" remark; (3) the 2008 incident\ninvolving the \"green cards\"; (3) the 2008 incident when appellant was eating Taco Bell\nand Ferguson commented that it probably reminded appellant of being back home;\n(4) the 2009 incident involving the training videos displaying flat breads when Ferguson\ncommented those probably reminded appellant of being at home; (5) the 2009 or 2010\nincident in which Ferguson referred to appellant as a \"lazy wetback\" in the presence of\nSiders and stated appellant would never be promoted if Ferguson had anything to do with\nit; (6) the 2010 incident in which Ferguson referred to appellant as \"Uncle JR\" in the\npresence of appellant's daughter, implying she was not biologically his daughter; and\n(7) the 2010 incident where Ferguson was discussing the television show \"Gangland\" and\nremarked that appellant could have starred in the show.\n      {¶ 40} Without citing specific dates or years, appellant further submits he was\nsometimes subjected to racial remarks or statements from Ferguson on a daily basis. This\nname-calling included remarks such as \"what's up burrito?\" or \"what's up Baby Loco?\"\n(Chapa depo., 199.) Ferguson used the \"Mexican, not a Mexican't\" phrase too. Appellant\ndescribed these routine instances as \"conversation starters\" in which Ferguson would\nmake some type of joke or remark whenever appellant had contact with him. Appellant\ntestified Ferguson also made comments that appellant was \"the only Mexican I know that\ndoesn't eat his own food or won't eat his own food.\" (Chapa depo., 200.)\n      {¶ 41} While we agree that the comments were made on a somewhat frequent\nbasis, we do not agree that this, by itself, constitutes a hostile working environment, as\nadditional factors must be considered, along with the environment as a whole.

Glenny Glass Co., S.D. Ohio No. 1:06cv638 (Apr. 20, 2007), for instruction. In\nGlenny Glass, an African-American plaintiff asserted a claim for a racially hostile work\nenvironment based upon seven incidents of conduct which included comments such as\nfrequently comparing the plaintiff's manner of walking to \"picking cotton,\" advising a\ncustomer not to touch a piece of glass containing a wet black glue because the plaintiff was\n\"white when he started,\" and a co-worker's comparison of plaintiff to a black photograph\nthat did not develop properly. The Sixth Circuit noted that while there was no controlling\ncase law on how to determine \"severity,\" common sense would dictate that the comments\nwere \"base [sic], insensitive, and inappropriate.\" However, they could not reasonably be\nperceived as \"severe\" and were not physically threatening.            See also Zacchaeus\n(infrequent comments made on three occasions over a one-week time frame, such as\n\"black South Africans are monkeys,\" while offensive utterances did not rise to the level of\nseverity necessary for an actionable hostile work environment claim).\n       {¶ 47} Here, appellant's deposition testimony and the affidavit of Siders supports a\nfinding that Ferguson called appellant a \"wetback\" on one occasion in the presence of\nSiders but when appellant was not present. Counsel for appellant seems to argue that\nappellant was called a \"wetback\" on a daily basis. Yet, we struggle to interpret appellant's\ndeposition testimony as indicating that the term \"wetback\" was used on a daily basis. This\nstruggle is made more complicated by the fact that appellant frequently failed to cite to\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           15\n\n\nthe places in the record which support his position or to support his factual assertions\nusing evidence in the record. See App.R. 16(A)(6) and (7).\n       {¶ 48} Instead, our reading of the transcript indicates that the use of the term\n\"wetback\" occurred on a single occasion rather than on a daily basis, but that other terms,\nlike \"burrito\" and \"Baby Loco,\" were used on a regular basis, and that the term \"wetback\"\nwas used once outside appellant's presence and relayed to him by Siders. Appellees\nappear to interpret the testimony in this fashion as well. Admittedly however, given the\nrather vague nature of the questioning on re-direct, it is possible that appellant's\ntestimony could be interpreted to mean that the term \"wetback\" was one of the terms\nused on a routine basis, although we believe it unlikely. (Chapa depo., 166-71; 199-201.)\n       {¶ 49} Nevertheless, appellant's testimony also indicated that he and Ferguson\n\"sometimes\" worked the same shift, such as when Ferguson was filling in for another\nsupervisor. (Chapa depo., 201.) This tends to make the conduct less pervasive. Given the\nnumber and context of the specific comments referenced by appellant and the general\nassertions made with respect to the \"routine\" name-calling, and given the testimony\nindicating that Ferguson and appellant only \"sometimes\" worked the same shift, it is\ndifficult to characterize the conduct as pervasive or severe, based upon our analysis of\nother cases asserting a claim for hostile working environment based on race, as shall be\nset forth in more detail below.\n                     c. Physically Threatening or Humiliating\n       {¶ 50} Appellant also argues the trial court erred in determining Ferguson's\nconduct was not physically threatening or humiliating, citing to use of the phrase\n\"wetback\" on a daily basis and the making of the \"green cards\" which purportedly\nquestioned appellant's citizenship and his value as a human being. Appellant contends\nthese acts were humiliating and offensive.\n       {¶ 51} First, we note again that we disagree with appellant's characterization that\nhe was called a \"wetback\" on a daily basis. As stated above, we do not believe the record\nsupports this assertion. Also, the \"wetback\" comment that is supported by the record was\nnot made in appellant's presence, but instead was made to a co-employee. Second, with\nrespect to Ferguson's act of presenting the \"green cards\" to appellant, it is significant to\npoint out that this is one of the only incidents that appellant actually complained about to\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                               16\n\n\na supervisor. Following his complaint, the \"green card\" issue was never raised again,\nalthough appellant testified he did not know if Ferguson was ever confronted by Genpak\nabout the cards.     Admittedly, appellant did testify and aver in his affidavit that he\ninterpreted the \"green cards\" as meaning he was not equal to Ferguson. He further\naverred this was \"like a slap in the face.\" (Chappa Affidavit, ¶ 3, R. 67, Exhibit A.)\nHowever, see Bourini v. Bridgestone/Firestone N. Am. Tire, L.L.C., 136 F.Appx. 747 (6th\nCir.2005) (comments such as referring to a Muslim co-worker as a \"camel jockey\" and\ntelling the co-worker that he might be able to hear better if he got the sand out of his ears\ndid not rise to the \"humiliating\" level of severe conduct required to create an objectively\nhostile work environment). Finally, none of the comments or actions alleged by appellant\ncould be interpreted as physically threatening. As a result, we do not believe the conduct\nat issue rises to the level of being physically threatening or sufficiently humiliating to\nconstitute conduct creating an objectively hostile work environment.\n                      d. Interference with Work Performance\n       {¶ 52} In addition, appellant argues the trial court improperly found interference\nwith work performance was the determining factor in its analysis of appellant's hostile\nwork environment claim, rather than analyzing such interference as but one factor in the\nanalysis. Appellant further asserts the test can be met even if job performance is not\ntangibly affected.   Appellant claims the totality of the circumstances here constitute\nevidence of an adverse affect on the terms and conditions of appellant's employment.\nAppellant submits the trial court should have determined whether or not the terms and\nconditions of employment were affected by Ferguson's offensive conduct and comments.\n       {¶ 53} We disagree with appellant's assertion that the trial court found interference\nwith work performance to be the determining factor in its analysis of this claim. Rather,\nthe trial court's decision reflects that it considered all of the relevant factors in making its\ndetermination. In reviewing the trial court's decision, we find it conducted an in-depth\nanalysis of all of the circumstances to be considered in determining if the conduct at issue\nhad the effect of unreasonably interfering with appellant's work performance or of\ncreating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.\n       {¶ 54} A hostile work environment exists where \"the workplace is permeated with\n'discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult' * * * that is 'sufficiently severe or\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                             17\n\n\npervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive\nworking environment[.]' \" Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 21, quoting Meritor Savings Bank, FSB\nv.

Severe or Pervasive – a Comparison with Other Cases\n       {¶ 56} In analyzing whether the trial court reached the appropriate result, we\nconduct a comparison of this case to other cases asserting a claim for hostile working\nenvironment based on race.\n       {¶ 57} In Glenny Glass, the plaintiff alleged he was subjected to seven instances of\ndisparaging remarks made by Glenny Glass employees or its president over a five-year\nperiod. In addition to the three instances cited above in our analysis of the severity factor,\nthe following additional instances occurred: (1) while lifting a piece of graylite glass 14\n(the darkest commercial glass available), the president said, \"you can lift that glass\nbecause it's black like you. Is that what happened to your wife?\"; (2) the president made\nreference to his grandparents having a black butler who made moonshine in the bathtub;\n(3) in response to a suggestion by a co-worker that they invite the plaintiff to join them on\nvacation, the president said \"why [does plaintiff] need to go to Florida? He's tanned\nenough\"; and (4) the employer received a fax on \"Ebonics\" which the president read aloud\nas he laughed, and plaintiff was offended by many of the statements.\n       {¶ 58} Specifically, the court in Glenny Glass found the frequency of the comments\nwas sporadic, rather than routine, and therefore the frequency factor did not weigh in the\nplaintiff's favor. As to the severity of the alleged comments, the court noted the comments\nwere not alleged to have been made with hostility, aggression, or violence. It noted the\ncomments could not reasonably be perceived as \"severe\" and none of the comments were\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                            18\n\n\nphysically threatening. Furthermore, the court determined that, taken as a whole, the\ncomments did not rise to the level of pervasive or severe and, based upon precedent, did\nnot form the basis of an actionable claim for a hostile work environment. Consequently,\nthe court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n       {¶ 59} In looking at the seven instances of conduct and reaching its determination,\nthe court in Glenny Glass considered various other Sixth Circuit cases as a benchmark.\nSee Jackson v.

In that case, a Muslim\nemployee alleged nine incidents of national origin and religious harassment: (1) a co-\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                                19\n\n\nworker proclaimed, \"I don't want to … see your camel tied to my wheels\"; (2) a co-worker\nreferred to him as a \"camel jockey\"; (3) following the September 11 attacks, a co-worker\nattempted to back over him with a forklift; (4) a co-worker said, \"If it were up to [me],\nthey would…put [plaintiff] in a box and send [him] back to [his] country\"; (5) a co-worker\ntold him, \"If you'd get the sand out of your ears you'll hear me better\"; (6) a co-worker\nimitated plaintiff's voice over the intercom system; (7) someone wrote Islamic slurs on the\nrestroom wall; (8) someone dropped off a Christian pamphlet at the plaintiff's work\nstation entitled, \"For my Muslim Friend\"; and (9) human resources sent an e-mail\nrelating to the plaintiff's immigration status to fellow employees. Upon review, the court\nconcluded the incidents, \"were not sufficiently pervasive to establish an abusive working\nenvironment.\" Id. at 751. Because the incidents occurred over a period of five years, the\ncourt determined they were \"relatively infrequent and isolated incidents\" that were\n\"insufficient to constitute discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of\nemployment.\" Id.\n       {¶ 61} Furthermore, our own court has analyzed a hostile working environment\nclaim in the context of racial harassment and determined the plaintiff failed to\ndemonstrate that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of\nthe plaintiff's work environment. In Zacchaeus, the plaintiff worked for his employer,\nMount Carmel, for less than two months. He testified that while working with the\nharassing co-employee, \"every night something is happen[ing]\" and the conduct was\ncontinuous. Id. The plaintiff alleged the co-employee made comments such as \"black\nSouth Africans are monkeys,\" \"all blacks are on Welfare and on drugs,\" and that she did\nnot like blacks. Id. After his firing, the plaintiff also worked for Mount Carmel through a\ntemporary agency and claimed a second co-employee made a comment to the effect that\n\"why is black children eating chocolate, and isn't that why their face is too black.\" Id.\n       {¶ 62} On appeal, Zacchaeus challenged the trial court's decision granting the\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment on the claim for racial harassment. Upon\nreview, we determined the evidence was insufficient to sustain the claim, finding the\nevidence presented did not meet the standard for conduct that was sufficiently severe or\npervasive to alter the conditions of the plaintiff's work environment. We found the\ncomments, which were made on only three occasions over a one-week timespan, were\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                             20\n\n\n\"infrequent.\"   We further noted the comments were not physically threatening or\nsufficiently humiliating to create a hostile working environment and did not rise to the\nseverity level necessary for an actionable claim.\n                     f. Subjective belief\n       {¶ 63} Finally, appellant argues the trial court erred in finding insufficient evidence\nto support a subjective belief that a hostile work environment existed. Appellant cites to\ntestimony and evidence indicating that Ferguson: (1) called appellant a \"wetback\";\n(2) stated he would interfere in appellant's efforts to obtain a promotion; and (3) created\nthe \"green cards.\" Appellant also testified he needed the job at Genpak to support his\nfamily and he attempted to work a different shift in order to limit contact with Ferguson.\nAppellant asserts the trial court considered other factors, such as the fact that appellant\nreturned to work for Genpak after previously resigning and that relatives of appellant also\ncame to work for Genpak, and improperly weighed the testimony and determined the\ncredibility of appellant. Appellant submits that genuine issues of material fact remain as\nto his subjective belief that a hostile working environment existed. We conclude the trial\ncourt did not err in finding insufficient evidence to support a subjective belief that a\nhostile work environment existed.\n       {¶ 64} To be an actionable hostile working environment claim, the conduct at issue\nmust be severe or pervasive enough to create: (1) an objectively hostile or abusive work\nenvironment, such that a reasonable person would find it to be hostile or abusive, and (2)\na subjectively hostile work environment, such that the victim himself perceived the\nenvironment to be hostile or abusive.

One additional factor which impacts\nour decision is evidence that a personal relationship existed between appellant and\nFerguson.\n       {¶ 66} Appellant argues the trial court improperly weighed the evidence and\ndetermined the credibility of the witnesses on this issue, given that Ferguson declared the\nworking environment was not hostile, while appellant maintained that it was. Yet, we do\nnot believe that is what the court did. Given the factual circumstances, which appellant\ndoes not dispute, we believe reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion on this\nissue, and that conclusion is adverse to appellant. We further believe it is \"so one-sided\nthat one party must prevail as a matter of law.\" Ochsmann at ¶ 10.\n       {¶ 67} Appellant has not denied that he recommended that four of his siblings\napply for jobs at Genpak. Those four sibilings applied and were subsequently hired.\nAppellant acknowledged that, after leaving Genpak of his own accord in 2005 and living\nout of state for approximately three years, he personally contacted Ferguson in 2008 to\ninquire about returning to work for Genpak. Even though Ferguson was no longer\nappellant's supervisor when appellant returned to Genpak in 2008, appellant has not\ndenied that he frequently hung out in Ferguson's office and talked with him and also\nloaned Ferguson DVDs of television shows he thought Ferguson would enjoy.\nFurthermore, appellant acknowledged he invited Ferguson to his home for a cookout for\nhis son's birthday.\n       {¶ 68} Based upon the foregoing analysis and our comparison of this case to other\ncases asserting a claim for hostile working environment based upon race, we conclude the\ntrial court reached the appropriate result with respect to the question of whether the\nconduct was severe or pervasive. Although the question of whether conduct is severe or\npervasive is \"quintessentially a question of fact,\" other courts, such as the Sixth Circuit,\nhave nevertheless affirmed grants of summary judgment and in a number of cases\ndetermined the alleged conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive as a matter of law.\nSee Chancellor v.

In addition,\nalthough appellant claims he believed the environment to be hostile but put up with it\nbecause he needed the job, his conduct indicates otherwise, and no reasonable juror could\nreach the conclusion that appellant subjectively believed he was being harassed by\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                            22\n\n\nFerguson on the basis of race or national origin. Finally, Ferguson's conduct did not\ncreate an objectively hostile work environment.\n       {¶ 69} In conclusion, we find appellant cannot establish his hostile working\nenvironment claim because he has failed to meet the fourth element of the test by\ndemonstrating that the alleged conduct was so severe or pervasive as to create an\nenvironment that was hostile pursuant to both a subjective and objective analysis.\n              2. The Fifth Element\n       {¶ 70} In order to establish a claim for a hostile work environment, appellant is\nalso required to demonstrate employer liability. Upon review, we find appellant cannot\nestablish a basis for employer liability, and thus appellant cannot meet the fifth element of\nthe test.\n       {¶ 71} The requirements for demonstrating employer liability differ, depending on\nwhether the alleged harasser is a supervisor or a co-worker.

When the alleged harasser is a\n              supervisor, the employer may be vicariously liable.\n              Burlington [Industries, Inc. v.

Under this scenario, when harassment by a\n              supervisor with authority over the employee culminates in a\n              tangible employment action against the plaintiff, the employer\n              is subject to vicarious liability and the analysis ends. Id. at\n              763-765 * * *.

McGraw at ¶ 21, citing\nHampel at 176. We relied upon Sixth Circuit precedent to define \"supervisor\" as \"an\nindividual who 'serves in a supervisory position and exercises significant control over the\nplaintiff's hiring, firing or conditions of employment.' \" McGraw at ¶ 22, quoting Pierce v.\nCommonwealth Life Ins.

In McGraw, we determined\nthat, although the defendant was a manager, he was not the plaintiff's named supervisor\nand he did not hire and could not fire the plaintiff, although he could direct the plaintiff\non what to do when she was occasionally helping and assisting others with their job tasks.\nWe determined this did not constitute significant control over the conditions of the\nplaintiff's employment, and although the defendant was on a higher level of authority\nthan the plaintiff, the defendant did not have direct control over the plaintiff and only had\nindirect control in limited circumstances. Consequently, we determined the defendant\nwas not appellant's supervisor and the alleged harassment must be analyzed under the co-\nworker harassment standard. We further defined that standard to be one where \"the\ncompany may be held liable for co-worker harassment if its response manifests\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                            24\n\n\nindifference or unreasonableness in light of the facts the employer knew or should have\nknown.\" McGraw at ¶ 24.\n       {¶ 75} The circumstances in the case before us are similar to those in McGraw in\nthat Ferguson was not appellant's supervisor at the time of these alleged incidents and\nthere is no evidence that he had the power to fire appellant or that he could significantly\nchange appellant's conditions of employment. While Ferguson was a supervisor, he was\nnot appellant's designated supervisor.      Therefore, we analyze the issue of employer\nliability under a co-worker liability standard.\n       {¶ 76} A company may be liable for co-worker harassment \"if its response\nmanifests indifference or unreasonableness in light of the facts the employer knew or\nshould have known.\" Id. at ¶ 25. A response is typically considered adequate if it is\nreasonably calculated to stop the harassment. Id. The effectiveness of the response is\nmeasured by whether the steps taken by the employer end the harassment. Id.\n       {¶ 77} In his deposition testimony, appellant acknowledged that he did not report\nmany of the incidents that occurred involving Ferguson. However, appellant argues that\nmanagers and supervisors were present during some of the harassment incidents, and,\ntherefore, Genpak knew or should have known about the harassment.\n       {¶ 78} Appellant testified that he reported the incident involving the \"green cards\"\nto Paulins, and that Paulins' reaction was one of \"disbelief.\" Appellant further testified he\ndid not know whether or not Paulins confronted Ferguson or did anything about the\nincident. However, the \"green cards\" incident was not repeated and no further discussion\nregarding the cards occurred.\n       {¶ 79} Appellant also argues that supervisor Paulins was present for the incident\ninvolving the \"Gangland\" comment, and, therefore, Paulins knew or should have known\nof the harassment and failed to take appropriate corrective action.         Even assuming\nPaulins was present and heard the comment, we have neither an affidavit nor deposition\ntestimony from Paulins, and there is nothing in the record that would indicate Paulins\nhad ever seen the show \"Gangland\" or knew that a comment such as that could be\ninterpreted as racial harassment.      As appellees argue, Paulins' presence during the\nutterance of a comment made about a television show that may not have had widespread\npopularity does not demonstrate that a supervisor was aware of the alleged harassment.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                          25\n\n\n         {¶ 80} In addition, appellant argues that another supervisor, Halliday, was aware\nof Ferguson making harassing remarks, but informed appellant he was not going to get\ninvolved. However, we find that appellant's deposition transcript does not support this\nclaim.\n         {¶ 81} Appellant testified at his deposition that supervisors Garrett and Halliday\nwere sometimes present when Ferguson made comments involving his race and/or\nnational origin.     However, appellant did not provide any details or cite to specific\nincidents when this occurred, other than simply his general comment that these two\nsupervisors were sometimes present. Appellant did testify to a time when Halliday told\nappellant that, if appellant wanted to do something about the comments made by\nFerguson, he (appellant) would have to contact the corporate office himself because\nHalliday was not going to do it. Yet, appellant did not provide any details about the\ncomments that were made at that time.          In fact, a review of appellant's deposition\ntranscript reveals the following exchange:\n               Q. You didn't say anything to [Garrett] or [Halliday] about it,\n               did you?\n\n               ***\n\n               A. Well, to [Halliday] I did. I didn't like how he used to, you\n               know, talk about me and stuff, because with [Halliday] I\n               actually –[Halliday] was the person who gave me – well, he\n               didn't like the way [Ferguson] used to talk about people\n               because he didn't feel that that was right, the way he would –\n               you know, his remarks and stuff towards not just me, but\n               other fellow employees.\n\n               ***\n\n               A. And [Halliday] actually said that that's something you'd\n               have to deal with corporate more than likely.\n\n               Q. Did you ask [Halliday] to do anything about it?\n\n               A. Well, he said he wasn't getting involved in that.\n\n(Emphasis added.) (Chapa depo., at 203-04.)\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           26\n\n\n       {¶ 82} This is not sufficient to establish that the \"comments\" were actually racially\ndisparaging or based upon national origin. It simply establishes that Halliday seemed to\ndislike the way Ferguson talked about people and disliked the remarks that Ferguson\nmade. It does not establish the existence of racial harassment. Furthermore, appellant\nadmitted that he never asked Garrett or Halliday to do anything about the comments or to\ntake any action against Ferguson. Thus, even if there were supervisors who were aware\nthat Ferguson had made some comments to appellant, the specifics of those comments\nare unknown. Moreover, even if these supervisors were aware of these non-descript\ncomments, there is no evidence that appellant asked the supervisors to take action against\nFerguson or that an official complaint was lodged which would alert Genpak to the\nspecific problem. \"Absent knowledge of the conduct, Defendants cannot be liable for\ncoworker harassment.\" Sweezer v. Michigan Dept. of Corr., 6th Cir. No. 99-1644\n(Aug. 11, 2000).\n       {¶ 83} The single incident with the \"green cards\" and the vague comment\nregarding the \"Gangland\" television show do not demonstrate that Genpak knew or\nshould have known that appellant was allegedly subjected to harassment. It cannot be\nsaid that Genpak's response manifested indifference or unreasonableness in light of the\nfacts that it knew or should have known. Therefore, we find appellant cannot meet the\nfifth element of the hostile work environment test.\n       {¶ 84} Because appellant cannot meet either the fourth or the fifth element of the\nhostile work environment racial harassment test, we overrule his first and second\nassignments of error.\n             Third and Fourth Assignments of Error – Race and National\n             Origin Discrimination\n\n       {¶ 85} In his third assignment of error, appellant claims he presented sufficient\nevidence of pretext regarding his claim for race and national origin discrimination, and\ntherefore summary judgment in favor of appellees was improper.               In his fourth\nassignment of error, appellant submits there are genuine issues of material fact remaining\nas to his race and national origin discrimination claim, and therefore it was improper to\ngrant summary judgment to appellees.        Because both of these assignments of error\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                            27\n\n\naddress his cause of action for race and national origin discrimination, we shall address\nthem together.\n              1. Direct Evidence of Discrimination\n       {¶ 86} In presenting these two assignments of error, appellant contends there is\ndirect evidence of discrimination involving his promotion denials on the basis of race\nand/or national origin. Appellant cites to evidence that Ferguson called him a \"wetback\"\nand commented that appellant would not be promoted to a supervisor position if\nFerguson had anything to do with it. Appellant also contends Ferguson had input into the\nselection of supervisors. Appellant asserts these comments from Ferguson constitute\ndirect evidence sufficient to prove appellees possessed racial animus prompting them to\nfail to promote him. Appellant argues that when a supervisor with unlawful\ndiscriminatory intent takes action to cause an adverse employment action, such as a\npromotion denial, the employer can be liable for discrimination, even if that supervisor\nwas not the final decision-maker.\n       {¶ 87} In order to prevail in a case alleging claims of racial discrimination under\nR.C. 4112.02(A), the plaintiff must prove discriminatory intent, which may be established\nwith either direct or indirect methods of proof.

Based upon the affidavit of Wilson, Wilson was the sole decision maker in\ndetermining who was hired for production supervisor positions.

Wilson also averred he did not consider any\nopinion that Ferguson may have had to be relevant. Appellant does not have any evidence\nto refute this. More importantly, the alleged comments upon which appellant relies were\nmade sometime during Siders' period of employment at Genpak, which ran between\nSeptember 23, 2009 and July 2010. Ferguson was not appellant's supervisor during this\ntime period.      In order to use the comments at issue as direct evidence in his\ndiscrimination case, Ferguson would have to the decision maker in deciding whether or\nnot appellant was promoted or his recommendation would need to be sought by the\ndecision maker, neither of which occurred here. In addition, the comments were not\nmade close in time with respect to the 2000/2001 and 2002 promotion denials.4 Thus,\nthese comments cannot be used as direct evidence.\n                2.

However, appellant\nargues the promotion denials were ongoing through January 2011. Despite the fact that\nthese promotion denials occurred more than six years prior to the filing of appellant's\ncomplaint, appellant argues these claims can be pursued under the \"continuing violation\"\ndoctrine.\n       {¶ 98} \"An action upon * * * a liability created by statute other than a forfeiture or\npenalty * * * shall be brought within six years after the cause thereof accrued.\" Cosgrove\nv.

In addition, because the denial of a promotion is a discrete act,\nmeaning it is easy to identify, the \"continuing violation\" theory is not applicable.\n       {¶ 101} Even if the continuing violation doctrine were applicable, appellant has not\nidentified in his brief the promotion denials that were discriminatory in the six-year time\nperiod prior to the filing of this lawsuit.       Thus, appellant has not identified the\n\"continuing\" violations that would permit inclusion of the 2000/2001 and 2002 claims.\n       {¶ 102} Moreover, even if the claims were not time-barred, appellant cannot\nestablish his denial of promotion claims using indirect evidence.\n       {¶ 103} Without establishing how he has made his prima facie case and without\nsetting forth Genpak's purported nondiscriminatory reasons for failing to promote him or\nthe flaws in its assertions, appellant jumps immediately to the next step in the burden-\nshifting analysis under McDonnell Douglas and claims he has demonstrated pretext with\nrespect to the reasons why he was not promoted when Hill was promoted in 2000/2001.\nAppellant argues this establishes genuine issues of material fact which preclude summary\njudgment.    However, appellant has not presented evidence showing that Genpak's\nasserted reasons for declining to promote him are actually a pretext for race and/or\nnational origin discrimination. Wilson testified his decision not to promote appellant was\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                             32\n\n\ndue to appellant's lack of supervisory experience, his failure to attend management classes\nto compensate for this lack of experience, his attendance problems, and his lack of\ndependability. These are quite arguably valid, legitimate reasons for not promoting\nappellant. Appellant's efforts to offer explanations for his attendance difficulties after the\nfact do not change anything. There is no evidence in the record that these reasons are not\nthe \"real\" reason appellant was not promoted or that discrimination was the \"real\" reason\nhe was not promoted.\n       {¶ 104} Based upon the foregoing, we find appellant has failed to properly present\neither direct or indirect evidence to support his claim for racial discrimination in his\nfailure to promote action.      Accordingly, we overrule appellant's third and fourth\nassignments of error.\n       B.    Fifth Assignment of Error – Negligent Retention & Negligent\n             Supervision\n\n       {¶ 105} Finally, in his fifth assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court\nerred in granting summary judgment on his claims for negligent retention and\nsupervision. Appellant asserts Ferguson subjected him to routine name-calling in the\npresence of managers and supervisors and, given that said supervisors were aware of the\nharassment, appellant argues he has met the elements necessary to establish these claims.\n       {¶ 106} In order to establish a claim for negligent supervision or retention, the\nfollowing elements must be demonstrated: \"(1) the existence of an employment\nrelationship; (2) the employee's incompetence; (3) the employer's actual or constructive\nknowledge of such incompetence; (4) the employer's act or omission causing plaintiff's\ninjuries; and (5) the employer's negligence in hiring or retaining the employee as the\nproximate cause of plaintiff's injuries.\" Peterson at 729, citing Evans v.

As for the second element, appellant asserts he has established incompetence\nby demonstrating racial and national origin harassment via Ferguson's routine name-\ncalling in the presence of managers and supervisors, and via the presentation of the\ncounterfeit \"green cards,\" created by Ferguson, to the production manager.\n       {¶ 108} In addressing the second prong, we note that we have already determined\nin our analysis of appellant's first and second assignments of error that appellant has\nfailed to demonstrate harassing behavior on the basis of race and/or national origin\nsufficient to create a hostile work environment.

Because appellant did not\npresent sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact concerning the\nalleged harassment based upon race and/or national origin, we do not believe appellant\nhas established the required incompetence. Nevertheless, assuming for purposes of this\nparticular analysis that he somehow has, we shall address the third prong of the test.\n       {¶ 109} Appellant claims he has met the third element of the test, arguing Genpak\nhad actual or constructive knowledge of Ferguson's \"incompetence,\" meaning his\npropensity to refer to an employee in a racially disparaging manner and to harass\nemployees.\n       {¶ 110} As stated above, the third element of the test for negligent supervision\nand/or negligent retention is actual or constructive knowledge of the harassment on the\npart of the employer. Appellant claims Genpak's knowledge of the harassment was\npreviously established as a result of: (1) Ferguson's comment calling an African-American\nemployee a \"nigger\"; and (2) the sexual harassment allegations against Ferguson\ninvolving employee Siders, who purportedly claims Ferguson grabbed her face and\nforcibly attempted to kiss her. Appellant contends Genpak failed to take any action\nagainst Ferguson following these incidents (such as termination or, at a minimum, closer\nsupervision), and if it had, Ferguson would not have been able to harass and thus injure\nappellant.   Appellant claims Genpak's knowledge of the harassment has also been\nestablished by: (1) Ferguson's pattern of engaging in routine name-calling in the presence\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                               34\n\n\nof managers and supervisors; and (2) appellant's act of presenting the counterfeit \"green\ncards\" created by Ferguson to Genpak's production manager (Paulins).\n       {¶ 111} Negligent retention and supervision are negligence-based torts which\nrequire proof of the basic elements of negligence: duty, breach, proximate cause, and\ndamages.

See App.R. 16(A)(6) and (7) and 16(D). Appellant has failed to point to anything in\nthe record that proves this \"fact\" that he has asserted, aside from the statement he sets\nforth in his reply brief. Factual assertions which are not supported by a citation to the\nrecord should not be considered by the court on appeal.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           35\n\n\n       {¶ 115} Furthermore, in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the\nadverse party must produce the type of evidence admissible pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C),\nwhich shows there is a genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is not entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law. Appellant has failed to point to any evidence admissible\nunder Civ.R. 56(C) upon which the court could rely to support appellant's assertion\nregarding Siders' claim of discrimination and Genpak's knowledge thereof. No such\nadmissible evidence has been produced here.\n       {¶ 116}   To be sure, there is a passing reference in appellant's deposition\nmentioning that Siders had filed a claim against Genpak, but no details were provided\nregarding the allegations or against whom specifically the allegations are directed, other\nthan it involves a discrimination claim. Significantly, there was neither a reference in the\ndeposition testimony to Ferguson, nor an indication of the time period during which this\nalleged discrimination occurred, so it is unknown to us whether any purported incident\ninvolving Siders occurred before or after the incidents involving appellant, or, assuming it\nwas reported to Genpak supervisors, whether such reporting occurred before or after the\nalleged incidents with appellant. Moreover, Siders' affidavit sheds no light on anything\ninvolving her personal allegations. Instead, the affidavit focuses solely upon the comment\nshe purportedly heard Ferguson utter regarding appellant. We note that Siders' affidavit\ndoes state that she was employed at Genpak from September 23, 2009 to July 2010.\n       {¶ 117}   Second, appellant's testimony that Ferguson referred to an African-\nAmerican employee as a \"nigger\" on one occasion in the presence of the production\nmanager when the subject employee was not present does not demonstrate that it was\nforeseeable to Genpak that Ferguson would engage in harassment against appellant based\nupon race and/or national origin.\n       {¶ 118}   Assuming for purposes of this argument that the comment was indeed\nmade in the presence of Paulins and heard by Paulins, it was one racial slur made in\n2008. Although such a comment is extremely inappropriate and offensive, that one\ncomment made under those circumstances does not demonstrate a viable claim for\nnegligent retention and supervision. Ferguson did not have a history of criminal, tortious\nor otherwise dangerous conduct. In fact, there is evidence in the record showing that\nduring the 13 years of Ferguson's 16-year tenure with Genpak that Wilson had been\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                              36\n\n\nemployed as the plant manager, no employee had ever alleged to Wilson that Ferguson\nhad engaged in racial or national origin harassment. Ferguson also averred in an affidavit\nthat, prior to the instant case, no employee had ever accused him, to his knowledge, of\nworkplace harassment or discrimination based upon race or national origin.\n       {¶ 119}     Third, contrary to appellant's assertions, he has not established a pattern\nof routine name-calling in the presence of supervisors and managers.\n       {¶ 120}     As previously noted, appellant testified at his deposition that supervisors\nGarrett and Halliday were sometimes present when Ferguson made comments involving\nhis race and/or national origin. However, as we stated above, aside from a general\ncomment that these two supervisors were sometimes present when Ferguson made\ncomments, appellant did not provide any details about the type of comments being made\nor cite to specific incidents of when this occurred. Again, this is not sufficient to establish\nthat these non-descript \"comments\" were actually racially disparaging or based upon\nnational origin.\n       {¶ 121}     Appellant also testified that production manager Paulins was present\nsometimes when Ferguson made comments.                 However, according to appellant's\ndeposition testimony, there were only two incidents for which Paulins was present and/or\nmade aware of the incident. The first was in 2008 when appellant showed Paulins the\ntwo counterfeit \"green cards.\" The second was in 2010, when appellant testified Paulins\nwas present when Ferguson was talking to appellant about the television show\n\"Gangland\" and commented that appellant could have starred in the show. Appellant\nacknowledged that he did not report the 2010 \"Gangland\" comment to a supervisor or\nanyone else. Consequently, it would seem that appellant did not ask Paulins to take\naction against Ferguson for this comment or make a formal complaint.\n       {¶ 122}     While arguably offensive and/or demeaning, these incidents, which span\na period of two to three years, do not constitute routine name-calling in the presence of\nsupervisors and managers by which a reasonably prudent person would have anticipated\nthat an injury was likely to result. As previously stated, the \"Gangland\" comment was\nvague, and it is unclear whether or not Paulins knew anything about the show or\nunderstood what appellant purports Ferguson was implying by referencing the show.\nAnd, although the incident involving the \"green cards\" was offensive and demeaning, this\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                           37\n\n\nincident occurred only one time. Appellant did, in fact, complain about this particular\nincident and, following said complaint, the \"green cards\" were never presented again.\nAppellant also testified he did not know if Paulins or another Genpak supervisor or\nmanager ever addressed the issue with Ferguson. Thus, it is unknown whether or not\nGenpak intervened or took any action to prevent a recurrence of the behavior in the\nworkplace, but the evidence shows that these particular cards were never used again.\n         {¶ 123}   In conclusion, the totality of the circumstances at issue are not\n\"somewhat overwhelming\" and it cannot be said that a reasonably prudent person would\nanticipate that an injury was likely to result by way of Ferguson's conduct, based upon\nthese circumstances. The prior behavior was legally insufficient to establish foreseeability\nfor the purpose of appellant's negligent hiring and negligent retention claims. This court\nhas previously required much more in order for there to be an issue as to whether the\nbehavior was foreseeable. See, e.g., Wagner (physician with known chemical impairment\nissues and practicing under a consent agreement with the state had his medical license\nsuspended and his clinical contract and privileges terminated by employer hospital;\nphysician was known to have manipulated a former patient's pain pump to divert drugs to\nhimself; genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether hospital should have\nreasonably foreseen the consequence of its decision to retain physician in a\nfaculty/researcher position when physician harmed two former patients under the guise\nof conducting \"research\" by siphoning morphine from their pain pumps).\n         {¶ 124} Based upon Ferguson's history and the information which was known or\nshould have been known to Genpak, it was not foreseeable, using a totality of the\ncircumstances analysis, that Ferguson would allegedly injure appellant.          Therefore,\nappellant cannot establish the third element of his negligent retention and negligent\nsupervision claims. Consequently, because appellant has not established that Genpak had\nprior knowledge of Ferguson's incompetence, appellant cannot establish the fourth\nelement (Genpak's act or omission caused appellant's injuries) or the fifth element\n(Genpak's negligence was the proximate cause of appellant's injuries). Because we find\nthe trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on appellant's negligent\nretention and negligent supervision claims, we overrule appellant's fifth assignment of\nerror.\n\fNo. 12AP-466                                                                        38\n\n\nV.
