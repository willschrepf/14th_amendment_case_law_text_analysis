LeBlanc claimed that Lamar and Peveto discriminated\r\nagainst her because of her disability and subjected her to a hostile work environment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc raises three issues on appeal.  In the first, she asserts the trial court erred in\r\ndenying her motion for partial summary judgment.  In issues two and three, she contends the\r\ntrial court erred in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>I. Background</center>\r\n\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc has a hereditary, neurological disorder called Friedreich's ataxia.  It is a\r\nprogressive disease that affects balance and coordination.  At the time of LeBlanc's\r\ndeposition, she was confined to a wheelchair. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc began working at Lamar's Learning Resource Center (\"Center\") in the fall\r\nof 1999.  The Center provides computer access and tutoring to students in math, English,\r\nreading, and various computer software applications.  Her immediate supervisor was Peveto,\r\nthe Center's Coordinator.  Lamar also hired Barbara Sarver in a similar position.  Both\r\nLeBlanc and Sarver were hired on a part-time basis (eighteen hours per week) to assist with\r\ntutoring.  Funding for their jobs came from a pooled position in Lamar's Business and\r\nTechnology division.  Although they were designated as \"adjunct classroom assistants,\" there\r\nwere no job descriptions for their positions, which lasted for one semester and were not\r\nposted or otherwise filled in accordance with Lamar's requirements for hiring personnel for\r\nregular positions.  Further, LeBlanc and Sarver (and any individuals in other adjunct\r\npositions) were not guaranteed employment beyond the semester for which they were hired. \r\nAfter LeBlanc's and Sarver's initial appointments for the 1999 fall semester expired, \r\nLeBlanc and Sarver were reappointed for the part-time positions on a semester-by-semester\r\nbasis.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring budget preparations for fiscal year 2003, Peveto requested that the two part-\r\ntime positions held by LeBlanc and Sarver be replaced by one full-time and one part-time\r\nposition, with both of these new positions to be paid from the Center's funds.  Lamar's\r\nbudget committee subsequently approved only the full-time position, which Lamar classified\r\nas a \"laboratory technician.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn July 2002, Lamar posted the new full-time position on campus and through the\r\nTexas Workforce Commission.  Only LeBlanc and Sarver applied.  As job candidates, \r\nLeBlanc and Sarver took a test that was designed to measure their skills pertinent to the\r\nposition's responsibilities, and a five-member search committee interviewed them.  The\r\ncommittee used the same set of interview questions for both women and assigned each a\r\nscore based on her application, letter of application, and interview responses.  LeBlanc\r\nearned 457.5 points in this part of the process, while Sarver earned 665. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBoth LeBlanc and Sarver took the same test, which was designed to demonstrate the\r\napplicant's skills in English, math, and computer science.  The test had five parts, with each\r\npart worth ten points.  The five parts were (1) English skills (correcting a paragraph), (2)\r\nmath skills (five problems worth two points each), (3) English and computer skills (preparing\r\na memorandum), (4) knowledge of Microsoft Excel, and (5) knowledge of Microsoft Access. \r\nLeBlanc scored 37 on this test, while Sarver scored 47.  Based on the total scores from the\r\napplications, interviews, and test results, the search committee unanimously recommended\r\nSarver for the job.</span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc, who has an associate's degree, subsequently applied for the Center's\r\nlaboratory manager's position, which required a bachelor's degree.  Nineteen individuals\r\napplied for the job, but Lamar only interviewed candidates who met the position's minimum\r\nqualifications. Lamar hired an individual from outside the College for the laboratory manager\r\nposition.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc sued Lamar and Peveto and claimed that she should have been offered either\r\nthe lab tech or the lab manager position.  The defendants filed a traditional motion for\r\nsummary judgment on all of LeBlanc's claims and LeBlanc filed a partial motion for\r\nsummary judgment on her claim of disability-based employment discrimination.<em> See</em> Tex. R.\r\nCiv. P. 166a(c).  The trial court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and\r\ndenied LeBlanc's motion for partial summary judgment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>II. Standard of Review</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"When both parties move for summary judgment and the trial court grants one motion\r\nand denies the other, the reviewing court should review the summary judgment evidence\r\npresented by both sides and determine all questions presented and render the judgment the\r\ntrial court should have rendered.

Comm'n v.\r\nPatient Advocates of Texas</em>, 136 S.W.3d 643, 648 (Tex. 2004) (citations omitted).  To prevail\r\non a summary judgment motion brought under Rule 166a(c), a movant must show that there\r\nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c); <em>Little v. Texas Dep't of Criminal Justice</em>, 148 S.W.3d 374,\r\n381(Tex. 2004)</span><span>.  A defendant \"who conclusively negates at least one essential element of a\r\ncause of action is entitled to summary judgment on that claim.\"  <em>IHS Cedars Treatment Ctr.\r\nof Desoto, Texas, Inc. v.

Grant</em>, 73 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2002)). </span><span> </span><span>A plaintiff moving for summary\r\njudgment must conclusively prove all essential elements of its claim.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P.\r\n166a(a), (c); <em>MMP, Ltd. v. Jones</em>, 710 S.W.2d 59, 60 (Tex. 1986);  <em>Roberts v. Clark, </em>188\r\nS.W.3d 204, 209 (Tex. App.-Tyler 2002, pet. denied).  \"When reviewing a summary\r\njudgment, we take as true all competent evidence favorable to the nonmovant, and we\r\nindulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the nonmovant's favor.\"\r\n<em>Diversicare Gen. Partner, Inc. v. Rubio,</em> 185 S.W.3d 842, 846 (Tex. 2005).  </span><span> If the movant\r\nestablishes a right to summary judgment, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to raise a\r\nmaterial fact issue sufficient to defeat summary judgment.  <em> See Centeq Realty, Inc. v.\r\nSiegler,</em> 899 S.W.2d 195, 197 (Tex. 1995).</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>III. Applicable Statute</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc sued the defendants under Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code (entitled\r\n\"Employment Discrimination\").<em>  See</em> Tex. Lab. Code Ann. §§ 21.001-21.556 (Vernon\r\n2006).  Section 21.051 of the Labor Code creates a cause of action against an employer that\r\ndiscriminates against a person \"because of\" a disability. <em> Id</em>. § 21.051.<sup> (1)</sup>\r\n<p><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOne of Chapter 21's purposes is providing \"for the execution of the policies\" of the\r\nfederal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"). <em> </em>Tex. Lab. Code Ann. §\r\n21.001(3) (Vernon 2006); <em>see</em> <em>Little,</em> 148 S.W.3d at 381-82; <em>see also</em> 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12101-12213 (2005).  Thus, when reviewing a trial court's decisions in disability-based employment\r\ndiscrimination cases, we may consider federal cases as precedent.  <em>See</em> <em>Quantum Chem. Corp.\r\nv. Toennies</em>, 47 S.W.3d 473, 476 (Tex. 2001); <em>see also Little</em>, 148 S.W.3d at 382 (noting that\r\nfederal decisions guide Texas courts in interpreting chapter 21's definition of disability).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>IV.  Disability-Based Employment Discrimination</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe first consider whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the\r\ndefendants on LeBlanc's employment-discrimination claim. To prevail on a disability\r\ndiscrimination claim, a plaintiff must show that (1) she has a \"disability,\" (2) she is\r\n\"qualified\" for the job she seeks, and (3) she suffered an adverse employment decision \r\nbecause of her disability.  </span><span><em>Turco v. Hoechst Celanese Corp.,</em> 101 F.3d 1090, 1092 (5th Cir.\r\n1996); <em>Davis v. City of Grapevine</em>, 188 S.W.3d 748, 757 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth, 2006, pet.\r\ndenied). </span><span>Employers are liable only for discrimination that occurs \"because of or on the basis\r\nof a physical or mental condition that <em>does not impair</em> an individual's ability to reasonably\r\nperform a job.\"  Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.105 (Vernon 2006) (emphasis added); <em>see Austin\r\nState Hosp. v. Kitchen,</em> 903 S.W.2d 83, 88 (Tex. App.-Austin 1995, no writ).</span><span>  Further,\r\nsection 21.128 declares: \tIt is an unlawful employment practice for a respondent covered under this\r\nchapter to fail or refuse to make a reasonable workplace accommodation to a\r\nknown physical or mental limitation of an <em>otherwise qualified individual </em>with\r\na disability who is an employee or applicant for employment, unless the\r\nrespondent demonstrates that the accommodation would impose an undue\r\nhardship on the operation of the business of the respondent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.128(a) (Vernon 2006) (emphasis added).</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn moving for summary judgment on LeBlanc's employment-discrimination claim,\r\nthe defendants asserted that LeBlanc was not a \"qualified individual\" as a matter of law.  A\r\nqualified, disabled person is one \"'</span><span>with a disability who, with or without reasonable\r\naccommodations can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such\r\nindividual holds or desires.'\"  <em>Turco</em>, 101 F.3d at 1092 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)).</span><span>\r\nHowever, </span><span>an employer's duty to make a \"reasonable workplace accommodation\" does not\r\narise unless the disabled employee or applicant is</span><span> an \"otherwise qualified individual.\"  </span><span>Tex.\r\nLab. Code Ann. § 21.128(a).<sup> (2)</sup></span><span>  \"[A]n otherwise qualified person is 'one who is able to meet\r\nall of the program's requirements in spite of [her] handicap.'\" <em>Burch v. City of Nacogdoches</em>,\r\n174 F.3d 615, 619 (5th Cir. 1999) (quoting <em>Turco</em>, 101 F.3d at 1093). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>If the defendants' evidence established that LeBlanc was not qualified</span><span> for the\r\npositions of lab technician or lab manager, to avoid summary judgment, LeBlanc would have\r\nto show that (1) she could perform the job's essential functions despite her disability, or (2)\r\nshe could perform the job's essential functions if she received a reasonable accommodation\r\nfor her disability.  <em>See Davis,</em> 188 S.W.3d at 763; <em>see also</em> <em>Cornyn v. Speiser, Krause,\r\nMadole, Mendelsohn &amp; Jackson</em>, 966 S.W.2d 645, 648-49 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1998,\r\npet. denied).</span><span> </span><span>Essential functions of a job are those that \"bear more than a marginal\r\nrelationship to the job at issue.\" <em>Chandler v. City of Dallas</em>, 2 F.3d 1385, 1393 (5th Cir.\r\n1993).<sup> (3)</sup>   Further, the plaintiff has the burden to request reasonable accommodations; she\r\ncannot expect the defendant to have \"extra-sensory perception\" about accommodations that\r\nwould allow her to perform the job's essential functions.  <em>See Burch v. City of Nacogdoches</em>,\r\n174 F.3d at 621; <em>Burch v. Coca-Cola, Co.</em>, 119 F.3d 305, 319 (5th Cir. 1997). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<center><em>A.</em> <em>Laboratory Technician</em></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe defendants' summary judgment evidence established that the laboratory\r\ntechnician's responsibilities included tutoring developmental students (those requiring \r\nremedial classes in math and English) as well as computer-science students.<sup> (4)</sup>\r\n<p><span>  In fact, the\r\nevidence showed that the Center consistently served more math and English students than\r\ncomputer students.<sup> (5)</sup>\r\n<p><span>  Thus, the ability to tutor math and English students was an essential job\r\nfunction and more than marginally related to the job. <em>See</em> <em>Chandler, </em>2 F.3d at 1393. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc's deposition testimony was part of the summary judgment evidence.  She\r\nacknowledged that she was not qualified to tutor in math and English, that she did not tutor\r\nin English, and that other personnel tutored the majority of math students.  She further agreed\r\nthat math was not a strong subject for her.  The record reflects that Peveto tutored the math\r\nand English students when both she and LeBlanc were present in the Center.  LeBlanc\r\nconceded that if the lab tech's job were to be a one-person job, that  person would need to\r\nbe able to tutor in everything, which she admittedly could not do. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAdditional summary judgment evidence included LeBlanc's test scores and interview-application results.   Leblanc's overall test score was significantly lower than Sarver's.  For\r\nthe test's math portion, LeBlanc scored two points out of a possible ten, while Sarver scored\r\nten points. </span><span> For the interview-application scoring, the committee considered the candidates's\r\napplications, letters of application, and interview responses.  LeBlanc's scores on this part\r\nof the interview-application were likewise significantly lower than Sarver's. </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition, the defendants offered the affidavit of Barbara Peveto.  As LeBlanc's\r\nsupervisor at the Center, Peveto observed LeBlanc's work for several years.  Peveto stated\r\nthat LeBlanc assisted the computer-science students but left the tutoring of the math and\r\nEnglish students to others.  When LeBlanc was the only employee on duty, the math and\r\nEnglish students did not receive assistance.  According to Peveto, if LeBlanc had been\r\nselected for the full-time position, there would have been no one to cover her inability to\r\ntutor in these two areas.  Sarver, according to Peveto, could tutor students in all required\r\nsubject areas. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude that the defendants' summary judgment evidence showed that LeBlanc\r\nwas not qualified to perform essential functions of the lab tech position.</span><span> Because the\r\ndefendants' evidence negated the qualification element of LeBlanc's cause of action, she had\r\nthe burden </span><span>to show she could perform the job despite her disability or to show that she could\r\nperform the job if given a reasonable accommodation that she requested.  <em>See Burch, </em>174\r\nF.3d at 621;</span><span><em> Siegler,</em> 899 S.W.2d at 197;</span><span> <em>Davis</em>, 188 S.W.3d at 763.</span><span>\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTherefore, we turn to LeBlanc's summary judgment evidence and her argument that\r\nshe was qualified for the job.  LeBlanc identifies certain evidence to show her qualifications\r\nfor the lab tech position.  She argues that her job-performance evaluations and a social\r\nsecurity evaluation indicate she was performing the essential job functions of her job\r\nsatisfactorily, with or without accommodation.  However, these evaluations relate to her\r\ntemporary job, one that had not been posted and did not have specific designated\r\nresponsibilities.  LeBlanc admittedly did not tutor math and English while in her temporary\r\nposition.  Thus, we conclude that these evaluations do not raise a genuine issue of material\r\nfact regarding whether LeBlanc could perform the responsibilities of the lab tech position,\r\nwhich required math and English tutoring.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc also maintains that her affidavit controverted the defendants' assertion that\r\nshe was not qualified.  LeBlanc's post-deposition affidavit asserted that she is \"well qualified\r\nto perform the essential job duties and tasks of the Technician I position for which [she] had\r\nbeen working [and] which was created from [her] part time position.\"  This is the only\r\nstatement in her affidavit in which she addresses her qualifications.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc's assertions, however, are conclusory.  First, without any factual basis,\r\nLeBlanc implies that the essential job duties of her former job are the same as the lab tech\r\nposition for which she applied. Second, she also concludes, without any factual basis,  that\r\nshe is \"well qualified\" for the new position. Such conclusory statements are insufficient to\r\ndefeat summary judgment.  <em>1001 McKinney Ltd. v. Credit Suisse First Boston Mortg.\r\nCapital</em>, 192 S.W.3d 20, 27 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied) (citing\r\n<em>Wadewitz v. Montgomery</em>, 951 S.W.2d 464, 466 (Tex. 1997)); <em>see</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(f). \r\nStatements are conclusory if they fail to provide underlying facts to support their conclusions. \r\n<em>1001 McKinney</em>, 192 S.W.3d at 27 (citing<em> Rizkallah v. Conner</em>, 952 S.W.2d 580, 587 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no writ)).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurther, LeBlanc does not present any evidence that prior to Lamar's hiring decision \r\nshe requested a reasonable accommodation that would have assisted her in performing the\r\nessential job functions of the lab tech position.  She had the burden to make such a request.</span><span>\r\n<em>See</em> <em>Burch v. City of Nacogdoches</em>, 174 F.3d at 621; <em>see also</em>  <em>Burch v. Coca-Cola Co.</em>, 119\r\nF.3d at 319.  The concept of </span><span>\"reasonable accommodation\"  embodies the notion that, with\r\nthe accommodation, the employee will be qualified to perform the job's essential functions. \r\n</span><span><em>See</em> </span><span><em>Turco</em>, 101 F.3d at 1093-94 (finding that plaintiff could avoid summary judgment by\r\nshowing that a reasonable accommodation of disability would have enabled him to perform\r\nessential job functions). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>Based on the summary judgment evidence, the only accommodation LeBlanc\r\nrequested was one dated April 30, 2001.  That request was for assistance in the restroom and\r\nassistance in getting to and from her vehicle.<sup> (6)</sup>  The record reflects that at the time Lamar\r\nmade its hiring decision in the summer of 2002, LeBlanc had made no suggestions regarding\r\nhow the school could accommodate her deficiencies in math and English.</span><span> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn summary, neither LeBlanc's affidavit nor her evaluations raise a fact issue to\r\ndemonstrate that she was qualified for the new lab tech position. Further, there is no evidence\r\nthat she requested reasonable accommodations regarding her inability to perform the job's\r\nessential functions. Thus, we conclude that LeBlanc failed to raise a fact issue to defeat the\r\nsummary judgment on her disability-discrimination claim as it relates to the lab tech position. \r\n<em>See Siegler,</em> 899 S.W.2d at 197.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><em>B. Laboratory Manager</em></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>The defendants further presented summary judgment evidence supporting their\r\ncontention that LeBlanc was not a qualified person for the laboratory manager's position.\r\nThe defendants showed that the laboratory manager's duties included supervising the lab\r\ntech, whose duties included tutoring in math and English, as described above.  Lamar's\r\nposted notice for the laboratory manager's position required applicants to have a bachelor's\r\ndegree.<em> </em>LeBlanc admittedly did not have a bachelor's degree.  The defendants' summary\r\njudgment evidence reflects that Lamar interviewed only applicants who had the position's\r\nrequired degree.  Further, LeBlanc conceded she was not aware of Lamar's interviewing any\r\napplicant who did not meet the degree requirement.  Thus, we conclude that the defendants'\r\nsummary judgment evidence negated the \"qualified individual\" element of LeBlanc's cause\r\nof action relating to the laboratory manager's position. </span><span><em>See Mason</em>, 143 S.W.3d at 798. </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThough LeBlanc had the burden to provide evidence establishing a fact issue on\r\nwhether she was qualified for the lab manager's position, she </span><span>offered no additional evidence\r\nbeyond that submitted in support of her claim that she was qualified for the lab tech position. \r\n</span><span>Thus, we find that the defendants established that LeBlanc was not qualified for the lab\r\nmanager's position and that she failed to raise a fact issue on whether she was qualified for\r\nthe position.</span><span><em>  See </em></span><span><em>Siegler,</em> 899 S.W.2d at 197. </span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccordingly, we find that the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the\r\ndefendants on LeBlanc's first cause of action, disability-based employment discrimination. \r\nOnce the defendants demonstrated that the employment decision was not disability-based,\r\nLeBlanc had the burden to raise a material issue of fact that she was qualified for one of the\r\ntwo jobs available.  <em>See id.</em>  Her summary judgment evidence fails to raise a genuine issue\r\nof material fact.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>V. Disability-Based Harassment</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe next consider whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the\r\ndefendants on LeBlanc's second cause of action, disability-based harassment.<sup> (7)</sup></span><span>  In her second\r\namended petition, LeBlanc alleged that she suffered harassment from Lamar and Peveto in\r\nthe following ways: (1) </span><span> Peveto  placed obstacles in front of LeBlanc's wheelchair, (2)\r\nPeveto placed documents in drawers above LeBlanc's reach, (3) Lamar refused to offer\r\nLeBlanc the full-time position, and (4) Peveto devised a test weighted against LeBlanc's\r\nstrengths.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>The United States Fifth Circuit first recognized disability-based harassment claims as\r\ncognizable under the ADA in 2001.  <em>See</em> <em>Flowers v. S. Reg'l Physician Servs. Inc.</em>, 247 F.3d\r\n229, 232, 234-5 (5th Cir. 2001) (finding that the ADA \"embraces claims of disability-based\r\nharassment,\" relying in part on Title VII, and noting similarities in language and purposes\r\nof Title VII and the ADA).  Neither party cites a Texas case considering the viability of a\r\ndisability-based harassment claim under Texas law, nor have we found any.  Its recognition,\r\nhowever, by the Fifth Circuit and the express language of the Texas statute serve as authority\r\nfor our doing so.  <em>See </em>Tex. Lab. Code Ann. </span><span>§ 21.001(3); </span><span><em>Toennies</em></span><span>, 47 S.W.3d at 476; </span><span><em>see also</em></span><span><em>\r\nLittle</em>, 148 S.W.3d at 382.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs an initial matter, a plaintiff must show that the complained-of conduct is an\r\nactionable offense. <em> See Gowesky v. Singing River Hosp. Sys.</em>, 321 F.3d 503, 509 (5th Cir.\r\n2003).  \"For workplace abuse to rise to the level of an actionable offense the 'disability-based\r\nharassment must be sufficiently pervasive or severe to alter the conditions of employment\r\nand create an abusive working environment.'\"  <em>Id</em>. (quoting <em>Flowers</em>, 247 F.3d at 236).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t Further, a plaintiff in a disability-based discrimination case must show that  (1)  she\r\nhas \"protected group\" status; (2) she suffered unwelcome, disability-based harassment that\r\naffected a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (3) her employer knew or should\r\nhave known about the harassment, but did not take prompt, remedial action.  <em>See Flowers,\r\n</em>247 F.3d at 235-36.  The defendants contend that the \"meager facts\" LeBlanc described do\r\nnot state a disability-harassment claim.  We agree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe defendants supported their contention with summary judgment evidence\r\ndeveloped primarily from LeBlanc's deposition testimony.  In regard to the obstacles that\r\nPeveto allegedly placed in the path of LeBlanc's wheelchair, LeBlanc testified that she could\r\nrecall one time that a chair was in her way.  In a follow-up question, defense counsel asked\r\nLeBlanc:  \"Well, I want to be sure that we have exhausted the subject of Ms. Peveto putting\r\nfurniture in the path of where your wheelchair needed to go.  Do you have anything else to\r\ntell me about that?\"  LeBlanc responded, \"No.\"  LeBlanc further testified as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Defense Counsel]:\tDid you ever ask Ms. Peveto to move something out of\r\nyour way and she didn't immediately do it?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[LeBlanc]:\t\tI don't recall.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[Defense Counsel]:\tWas there ever an instance where you were moving\r\nalong in your wheelchair and your path was blocked and\r\nMs. Peveto was there and you called for help and she did\r\nnot help you?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[LeBlanc]:\t\tI don't recall. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc's testimony about her other claims similarly failed to show action pervasive\r\nor severe enough to create an abusive environment.   In regard to Peveto's allegedly placing\r\ndocuments out of LeBlanc's reach, LeBlanc testified that this occurred four or five times\r\nduring a two-year period. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo negate LeBlanc's \"weighted test\" claim, the defendants presented evidence that\r\nforty percent of the test involved only computer skills, LeBlanc's area of strength.  Twenty\r\npercent involved a combination of computer and English skills, and the remaining forty\r\npercent tested math and English  skills (twenty percent for each).  In addition, as for Lamar's\r\nhiring others instead of LeBlanc, we have already found that LeBlanc failed to create an issue\r\nof material fact regarding her employment-discrimination claim.  Thus, we fail to see how\r\nthe design of a test for another job position or how Lamar's hiring decision on another\r\nposition are relevant to LeBlanc's claims of disability-based harassment occurring when she\r\nwas a classroom assistant.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe defendants' summary judgment evidence proved that the complained-of actions \r\nwere not sufficiently pervasive to support a disability-based harassment claim.  <em>See Gowesky,\r\n</em>321 F.3d at 509; <em>Flowers</em>, 247 F.3d at 236.<em>  </em>Thus, the burden shifted to LeBlanc to controvert\r\nthe defendants' showing. </span><span><em> See Siegler,</em> 899 S.W.2d at 197.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her response to Lamar's motion for summary judgment, LeBlanc cited no authority\r\nsupporting her contention that the alleged actions constituted disability-based harassment. \r\nLikewise, on appeal, she cites no authority supporting her contentions and  in her brief she\r\nfails to distinguish <em>Flowers </em>and <em>Gowesky</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tInstead, LeBlanc argues that certain disputed facts preclude summary judgment in the\r\ndefendants' favor.  LeBlanc argues that a dispute exists regarding whether Tony Barrientos\r\nled her to believe that Peveto placed obstacles in her path, placed documents out of her reach,\r\nand designed a biased test that would prevent her from scoring well.<sup> (8)</sup></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe standard for disability-based harassment, however,  is \"high.\" <em>See Gowesky</em>, 321\r\nF.3d at 509.  Even if we assume that obstacles were placed in her path on occasion,\r\ndocuments were placed out of her reach on occasion, and that the test design for the new job\r\nprecluded her from scoring well, the instances raised in the summary judgment evidence in\r\nsupport of these complaints are insufficiently \"pervasive\" to support a disability-based\r\nharassment claim, as a matter of law. <em> See Gowesky, </em>321 F.3d at 509; <em>Flowers</em>, 247 F.3d at\r\n236.  As was the case in <em>Gowesky</em>, here also, \"[i]t is not difficult to conclude on this slender\r\nevidence that no actionable disability-based harassment occurred.\"<em> See Gowesky</em>, 321 F.3d\r\nat 510.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe find that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the defendants \r\non LeBlanc's disability-based harassment claim.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>VI. Conclusion</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the defendants established that they were entitled to summary judgment on\r\nboth of LeBlanc's claims as a matter of law, the trial court did not err in granting summary\r\njudgment to them and denying LeBlanc's motion for partial summary judgment. We overrule\r\nLeBlanc's three issues and affirm the trial court's judgment.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAFFIRMED.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t____________________________</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHOLLIS HORTON</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Submitted on March 8, 2007</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Opinion Delivered July 26, 2007 </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Before McKeithen, C.J., Gaultney and Horton, JJ.\r\n<p>1.

Lamar did not grant LeBlanc's request for assistance in the restroom every three\r\nhours, which involved lifting her from her wheelchair, but offered instead to arrange her\r\nschedule so that she did not have to work more than three hours at a time.  LeBlanc refused\r\nthis proposal.  At her deposition, LeBlanc further stated that the only accommodation she did\r\nnot receive after April 2001 was restroom assistance.  Until the time LeBlanc left Lamar,\r\nTony Barrientos and security guards provided assistance to her vehicle. \r\n</p><p>7. </p></span><span>Though LeBlanc uses the term \"hostile work environment,\" we consider her claims\r\nto be for \"disability-based harassment,\" the term recognized by the Fifth Circuit.  <em>See</em>\r\n<em>Flowers v. S. Reg'l Physician Servs. Inc.</em>, 247 F.3d 229, 232, 234-35 (5th Cir. 2001).\r\n<p>8. </p></span><span>In her post-deposition affidavit, LeBlanc stated: \"Tony Barrientos agreed with me\r\nthat Ms. Peveto was discriminating against me and weighting the test so that Barbara Sarver\r\nwould have higher scores than me and [Peveto] could recommend [Sarver] based upon the\r\nscores of a discriminatory test.\"  LeBlanc further stated: \"I went into work on several\r\noccasions and there would be boxes obstructing my path.  It was my understanding from\r\nwhat I was told that Ms. Peveto placed the objects in my pathway to harass me.  To the best\r\nof my recollection it was Tony that told me.  I understood him to mean that she put them\r\nthere to obstruct my path. Ms. Peveto also put the tests that I was to administer in a filing\r\ncabinet in a drawer that she knew was above my reach.  Tony and I both believed she did this\r\nintentionally to harass and intimidate me.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn an affidavit presented by defendants, however, Tony Barrientos stated that he never\r\nobserved Peveto placing obstacles of any kind in the path of LeBlanc's wheelchair and never\r\nheard Peveto make any derogatory comment about LeBlanc's disability.  Barrientos further\r\nstated: \"Although Ms. LeBlanc and I had many conversations over the years and considered\r\none another friends, she never complained to me that anyone in the [Center] was placing\r\nobstacles in her path or that she was upset about the location of files.  The first I learned that\r\n[LeBlanc] was voicing such complaints was after this lawsuit was filed.\" He also said that\r\nhe believed the test taken by LeBlanc and Sarver \"fairly assessed the skills required for the\r\nposition.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

LeBlanc claimed that Lamar and Peveto discriminated\r\nagainst her because of her disability and subjected her to a hostile work environment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc raises three issues on appeal.  In the first, she asserts the trial court erred in\r\ndenying her motion for partial summary judgment.  In issues two and three, she contends the\r\ntrial court erred in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>I. Background</center>\r\n\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc has a hereditary, neurological disorder called Friedreich's ataxia.  It is a\r\nprogressive disease that affects balance and coordination.  At the time of LeBlanc's\r\ndeposition, she was confined to a wheelchair. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc began working at Lamar's Learning Resource Center (\"Center\") in the fall\r\nof 1999.  The Center provides computer access and tutoring to students in math, English,\r\nreading, and various computer software applications.  Her immediate supervisor was Peveto,\r\nthe Center's Coordinator.  Lamar also hired Barbara Sarver in a similar position.  Both\r\nLeBlanc and Sarver were hired on a part-time basis (eighteen hours per week) to assist with\r\ntutoring.  Funding for their jobs came from a pooled position in Lamar's Business and\r\nTechnology division.  Although they were designated as \"adjunct classroom assistants,\" there\r\nwere no job descriptions for their positions, which lasted for one semester and were not\r\nposted or otherwise filled in accordance with Lamar's requirements for hiring personnel for\r\nregular positions.  Further, LeBlanc and Sarver (and any individuals in other adjunct\r\npositions) were not guaranteed employment beyond the semester for which they were hired. \r\nAfter LeBlanc's and Sarver's initial appointments for the 1999 fall semester expired, \r\nLeBlanc and Sarver were reappointed for the part-time positions on a semester-by-semester\r\nbasis.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring budget preparations for fiscal year 2003, Peveto requested that the two part-\r\ntime positions held by LeBlanc and Sarver be replaced by one full-time and one part-time\r\nposition, with both of these new positions to be paid from the Center's funds.  Lamar's\r\nbudget committee subsequently approved only the full-time position, which Lamar classified\r\nas a \"laboratory technician.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn July 2002, Lamar posted the new full-time position on campus and through the\r\nTexas Workforce Commission.  Only LeBlanc and Sarver applied.  As job candidates, \r\nLeBlanc and Sarver took a test that was designed to measure their skills pertinent to the\r\nposition's responsibilities, and a five-member search committee interviewed them.  The\r\ncommittee used the same set of interview questions for both women and assigned each a\r\nscore based on her application, letter of application, and interview responses.  LeBlanc\r\nearned 457.5 points in this part of the process, while Sarver earned 665. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBoth LeBlanc and Sarver took the same test, which was designed to demonstrate the\r\napplicant's skills in English, math, and computer science.  The test had five parts, with each\r\npart worth ten points.  The five parts were (1) English skills (correcting a paragraph), (2)\r\nmath skills (five problems worth two points each), (3) English and computer skills (preparing\r\na memorandum), (4) knowledge of Microsoft Excel, and (5) knowledge of Microsoft Access. \r\nLeBlanc scored 37 on this test, while Sarver scored 47.  Based on the total scores from the\r\napplications, interviews, and test results, the search committee unanimously recommended\r\nSarver for the job.</span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc, who has an associate's degree, subsequently applied for the Center's\r\nlaboratory manager's position, which required a bachelor's degree.  Nineteen individuals\r\napplied for the job, but Lamar only interviewed candidates who met the position's minimum\r\nqualifications. Lamar hired an individual from outside the College for the laboratory manager\r\nposition.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc sued Lamar and Peveto and claimed that she should have been offered either\r\nthe lab tech or the lab manager position.  The defendants filed a traditional motion for\r\nsummary judgment on all of LeBlanc's claims and LeBlanc filed a partial motion for\r\nsummary judgment on her claim of disability-based employment discrimination.<em> See</em> Tex. R.\r\nCiv. P. 166a(c).  The trial court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and\r\ndenied LeBlanc's motion for partial summary judgment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>II.

She\r\nacknowledged that she was not qualified to tutor in math and English, that she did not tutor\r\nin English, and that other personnel tutored the majority of math students.  She further agreed\r\nthat math was not a strong subject for her.  The record reflects that Peveto tutored the math\r\nand English students when both she and LeBlanc were present in the Center.  LeBlanc\r\nconceded that if the lab tech's job were to be a one-person job, that  person would need to\r\nbe able to tutor in everything, which she admittedly could not do. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAdditional summary judgment evidence included LeBlanc's test scores and interview-application results.   Leblanc's overall test score was significantly lower than Sarver's.  For\r\nthe test's math portion, LeBlanc scored two points out of a possible ten, while Sarver scored\r\nten points. </span><span> For the interview-application scoring, the committee considered the candidates's\r\napplications, letters of application, and interview responses.  LeBlanc's scores on this part\r\nof the interview-application were likewise significantly lower than Sarver's. </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition, the defendants offered the affidavit of Barbara Peveto.  As LeBlanc's\r\nsupervisor at the Center, Peveto observed LeBlanc's work for several years.  Peveto stated\r\nthat LeBlanc assisted the computer-science students but left the tutoring of the math and\r\nEnglish students to others.  When LeBlanc was the only employee on duty, the math and\r\nEnglish students did not receive assistance.  According to Peveto, if LeBlanc had been\r\nselected for the full-time position, there would have been no one to cover her inability to\r\ntutor in these two areas.  Sarver, according to Peveto, could tutor students in all required\r\nsubject areas. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude that the defendants' summary judgment evidence showed that LeBlanc\r\nwas not qualified to perform essential functions of the lab tech position.</span><span> Because the\r\ndefendants' evidence negated the qualification element of LeBlanc's cause of action, she had\r\nthe burden </span><span>to show she could perform the job despite her disability or to show that she could\r\nperform the job if given a reasonable accommodation that she requested.  <em>See Burch, </em>174\r\nF.3d at 621;</span><span><em> Siegler,</em> 899 S.W.2d at 197;</span><span> <em>Davis</em>, 188 S.W.3d at 763.</span><span>\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTherefore, we turn to LeBlanc's summary judgment evidence and her argument that\r\nshe was qualified for the job.  LeBlanc identifies certain evidence to show her qualifications\r\nfor the lab tech position.  She argues that her job-performance evaluations and a social\r\nsecurity evaluation indicate she was performing the essential job functions of her job\r\nsatisfactorily, with or without accommodation.  However, these evaluations relate to her\r\ntemporary job, one that had not been posted and did not have specific designated\r\nresponsibilities.  LeBlanc admittedly did not tutor math and English while in her temporary\r\nposition.  Thus, we conclude that these evaluations do not raise a genuine issue of material\r\nfact regarding whether LeBlanc could perform the responsibilities of the lab tech position,\r\nwhich required math and English tutoring.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc also maintains that her affidavit controverted the defendants' assertion that\r\nshe was not qualified.  LeBlanc's post-deposition affidavit asserted that she is \"well qualified\r\nto perform the essential job duties and tasks of the Technician I position for which [she] had\r\nbeen working [and] which was created from [her] part time position.\"  This is the only\r\nstatement in her affidavit in which she addresses her qualifications.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc's assertions, however, are conclusory.  First, without any factual basis,\r\nLeBlanc implies that the essential job duties of her former job are the same as the lab tech\r\nposition for which she applied. Second, she also concludes, without any factual basis,  that\r\nshe is \"well qualified\" for the new position. Such conclusory statements are insufficient to\r\ndefeat summary judgment.  <em>1001 McKinney Ltd. v.

She had the burden to make such a request.</span><span>\r\n<em>See</em> <em>Burch v. City of Nacogdoches</em>, 174 F.3d at 621; <em>see also</em>  <em>Burch v. Coca-Cola Co.</em>, 119\r\nF.3d at 319.  The concept of </span><span>\"reasonable accommodation\"  embodies the notion that, with\r\nthe accommodation, the employee will be qualified to perform the job's essential functions. \r\n</span><span><em>See</em> </span><span><em>Turco</em>, 101 F.3d at 1093-94 (finding that plaintiff could avoid summary judgment by\r\nshowing that a reasonable accommodation of disability would have enabled him to perform\r\nessential job functions). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>Based on the summary judgment evidence, the only accommodation LeBlanc\r\nrequested was one dated April 30, 2001.  That request was for assistance in the restroom and\r\nassistance in getting to and from her vehicle.<sup> (6)</sup>  The record reflects that at the time Lamar\r\nmade its hiring decision in the summer of 2002, LeBlanc had made no suggestions regarding\r\nhow the school could accommodate her deficiencies in math and English.</span><span> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn summary, neither LeBlanc's affidavit nor her evaluations raise a fact issue to\r\ndemonstrate that she was qualified for the new lab tech position. Further, there is no evidence\r\nthat she requested reasonable accommodations regarding her inability to perform the job's\r\nessential functions. Thus, we conclude that LeBlanc failed to raise a fact issue to defeat the\r\nsummary judgment on her disability-discrimination claim as it relates to the lab tech position. \r\n<em>See Siegler,</em> 899 S.W.2d at 197.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><em>B. Laboratory Manager</em></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>The defendants further presented summary judgment evidence supporting their\r\ncontention that LeBlanc was not a qualified person for the laboratory manager's position.\r\nThe defendants showed that the laboratory manager's duties included supervising the lab\r\ntech, whose duties included tutoring in math and English, as described above.  Lamar's\r\nposted notice for the laboratory manager's position required applicants to have a bachelor's\r\ndegree.<em> </em>LeBlanc admittedly did not have a bachelor's degree.  The defendants' summary\r\njudgment evidence reflects that Lamar interviewed only applicants who had the position's\r\nrequired degree.  Further, LeBlanc conceded she was not aware of Lamar's interviewing any\r\napplicant who did not meet the degree requirement.  Thus, we conclude that the defendants'\r\nsummary judgment evidence negated the \"qualified individual\" element of LeBlanc's cause\r\nof action relating to the laboratory manager's position. </span><span><em>See Mason</em>, 143 S.W.3d at 798. </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThough LeBlanc had the burden to provide evidence establishing a fact issue on\r\nwhether she was qualified for the lab manager's position, she </span><span>offered no additional evidence\r\nbeyond that submitted in support of her claim that she was qualified for the lab tech position. \r\n</span><span>Thus, we find that the defendants established that LeBlanc was not qualified for the lab\r\nmanager's position and that she failed to raise a fact issue on whether she was qualified for\r\nthe position.</span><span><em>  See </em></span><span><em>Siegler,</em> 899 S.W.2d at 197. </span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccordingly, we find that the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the\r\ndefendants on LeBlanc's first cause of action, disability-based employment discrimination. \r\nOnce the defendants demonstrated that the employment decision was not disability-based,\r\nLeBlanc had the burden to raise a material issue of fact that she was qualified for one of the\r\ntwo jobs available.  <em>See id.</em>  Her summary judgment evidence fails to raise a genuine issue\r\nof material fact.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>V. Disability-Based Harassment</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe next consider whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the\r\ndefendants on LeBlanc's second cause of action, disability-based harassment.<sup> (7)</sup></span><span>  In her second\r\namended petition, LeBlanc alleged that she suffered harassment from Lamar and Peveto in\r\nthe following ways: (1) </span><span> Peveto  placed obstacles in front of LeBlanc's wheelchair, (2)\r\nPeveto placed documents in drawers above LeBlanc's reach, (3) Lamar refused to offer\r\nLeBlanc the full-time position, and (4) Peveto devised a test weighted against LeBlanc's\r\nstrengths.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>The United States Fifth Circuit first recognized disability-based harassment claims as\r\ncognizable under the ADA in 2001.  <em>See</em> <em>Flowers v. S. Reg'l Physician Servs. Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772924\"><a href=\"/opinion/772924/sandra-spragis-flowers-v-southern-regional-physician-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 232, 234-5 (5th Cir. 2001) (finding that the ADA \"embraces claims of disability-based\r\nharassment,\" relying in part on Title VII, and noting similarities in language and purposes\r\nof Title VII and the ADA).  Neither party cites a Texas case considering the viability of a\r\ndisability-based harassment claim under Texas law, nor have we found any.  Its recognition,\r\nhowever, by the Fifth Circuit and the express language of the Texas statute serve as authority\r\nfor our doing so.  <em>See </em>Tex. Lab. Code Ann. </span><span>§ 21.001(3); </span><span><em>Toennies</em></span><span>, 47 S.W.3d at 476; </span><span><em>see also</em></span><span><em>\r\nLittle</em>, 148 S.W.3d at 382.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs an initial matter, a plaintiff must show that the complained-of conduct is an\r\nactionable offense. <em> See Gowesky v. Singing River Hosp. Sys.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781064\"><a href=\"/opinion/781064/brenda-a-gowesky-md-v-singing-river-hospital-systems-dba-ocean/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span>, 509 (5th Cir.\r\n2003).  \"For workplace abuse to rise to the level of an actionable offense the 'disability-based\r\nharassment must be sufficiently pervasive or severe to alter the conditions of employment\r\nand create an abusive working environment.'\"  <em>Id</em>. (quoting <em>Flowers</em>, 247 F.3d at 236).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t Further, a plaintiff in a disability-based discrimination case must show that  (1)  she\r\nhas \"protected group\" status; (2) she suffered unwelcome, disability-based harassment that\r\naffected a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (3) her employer knew or should\r\nhave known about the harassment, but did not take prompt, remedial action.  <em>See Flowers,\r\n</em>247 F.3d at 235-36.  The defendants contend that the \"meager facts\" LeBlanc described do\r\nnot state a disability-harassment claim.  We agree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe defendants supported their contention with summary judgment evidence\r\ndeveloped primarily from LeBlanc's deposition testimony.  In regard to the obstacles that\r\nPeveto allegedly placed in the path of LeBlanc's wheelchair, LeBlanc testified that she could\r\nrecall one time that a chair was in her way.  In a follow-up question, defense counsel asked\r\nLeBlanc:  \"Well, I want to be sure that we have exhausted the subject of Ms. Peveto putting\r\nfurniture in the path of where your wheelchair needed to go.  Do you have anything else to\r\ntell me about that?\"  LeBlanc responded, \"No.\"  LeBlanc further testified as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Defense Counsel]:\tDid you ever ask Ms. Peveto to move something out of\r\nyour way and she didn't immediately do it?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[LeBlanc]:\t\tI don't recall.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[Defense Counsel]:\tWas there ever an instance where you were moving\r\nalong in your wheelchair and your path was blocked and\r\nMs. Peveto was there and you called for help and she did\r\nnot help you?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[LeBlanc]:\t\tI don't recall. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLeBlanc's testimony about her other claims similarly failed to show action pervasive\r\nor severe enough to create an abusive environment.   In regard to Peveto's allegedly placing\r\ndocuments out of LeBlanc's reach, LeBlanc testified that this occurred four or five times\r\nduring a two-year period. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo negate LeBlanc's \"weighted test\" claim, the defendants presented evidence that\r\nforty percent of the test involved only computer skills, LeBlanc's area of strength.  Twenty\r\npercent involved a combination of computer and English skills, and the remaining forty\r\npercent tested math and English  skills (twenty percent for each).  In addition, as for Lamar's\r\nhiring others instead of LeBlanc, we have already found that LeBlanc failed to create an issue\r\nof material fact regarding her employment-discrimination claim.  Thus, we fail to see how\r\nthe design of a test for another job position or how Lamar's hiring decision on another\r\nposition are relevant to LeBlanc's claims of disability-based harassment occurring when she\r\nwas a classroom assistant.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe defendants' summary judgment evidence proved that the complained-of actions \r\nwere not sufficiently pervasive to support a disability-based harassment claim.  <em>See Gowesky,\r\n</em>321 F.3d at 509; <em>Flowers</em>, 247 F.3d at 236.<em>  </em>Thus, the burden shifted to LeBlanc to controvert\r\nthe defendants' showing. </span><span><em> See Siegler,</em> 899 S.W.2d at 197.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her response to Lamar's motion for summary judgment, LeBlanc cited no authority\r\nsupporting her contention that the alleged actions constituted disability-based harassment. \r\nLikewise, on appeal, she cites no authority supporting her contentions and  in her brief she\r\nfails to distinguish <em>Flowers </em>and <em>Gowesky</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tInstead, LeBlanc argues that certain disputed facts preclude summary judgment in the\r\ndefendants' favor.  LeBlanc argues that a dispute exists regarding whether Tony Barrientos\r\nled her to believe that Peveto placed obstacles in her path, placed documents out of her reach,\r\nand designed a biased test that would prevent her from scoring well.<sup> (8)</sup></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe standard for disability-based harassment, however,  is \"high.\" <em>See Gowesky</em>, 321\r\nF.3d at 509.  Even if we assume that obstacles were placed in her path on occasion,\r\ndocuments were placed out of her reach on occasion, and that the test design for the new job\r\nprecluded her from scoring well, the instances raised in the summary judgment evidence in\r\nsupport of these complaints are insufficiently \"pervasive\" to support a disability-based\r\nharassment claim, as a matter of law. <em> See Gowesky, </em>321 F.3d at 509; <em>Flowers</em>, 247 F.3d at\r\n236.  As was the case in <em>Gowesky</em>, here also, \"[i]t is not difficult to conclude on this slender\r\nevidence that no actionable disability-based harassment occurred.\"<em> See Gowesky</em>, 321 F.3d\r\nat 510.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe find that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the defendants \r\non LeBlanc's disability-based harassment claim.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>VI. Conclusion</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the defendants established that they were entitled to summary judgment on\r\nboth of LeBlanc's claims as a matter of law, the trial court did not err in granting summary\r\njudgment to them and denying LeBlanc's motion for partial summary judgment. We overrule\r\nLeBlanc's three issues and affirm the trial court's judgment.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAFFIRMED.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t____________________________</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHOLLIS HORTON</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Submitted on March 8, 2007</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Opinion Delivered July 26, 2007 </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Before McKeithen, C.J., Gaultney and Horton, JJ.\r\n<p>1.  Section  21.051 provides: </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tAn employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of\r\nrace, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t(1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\r\ndiscriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with\r\ncompensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment;  or</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t(2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\r\nemployment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual\r\nof any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the\r\nstatus of an employee.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span> Tex.

Records for the 1999-2001 spring\r\nsemesters likewise showed more math and English students (347) used the Center than did\r\ncomputer students (224). </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Lamar did not grant LeBlanc's request for assistance in the restroom every three\r\nhours, which involved lifting her from her wheelchair, but offered instead to arrange her\r\nschedule so that she did not have to work more than three hours at a time.  LeBlanc refused\r\nthis proposal.  At her deposition, LeBlanc further stated that the only accommodation she did\r\nnot receive after April 2001 was restroom assistance.  Until the time LeBlanc left Lamar,\r\nTony Barrientos and security guards provided assistance to her vehicle. \r\n</p><p>7. </p></span><span>Though LeBlanc uses the term \"hostile work environment,\" we consider her claims\r\nto be for \"disability-based harassment,\" the term recognized by the Fifth Circuit.  <em>See</em>\r\n<em>Flowers v. S. Reg'l Physician Servs. Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772924\"><a href=\"/opinion/772924/sandra-spragis-flowers-v-southern-regional-physician-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 232, 234-35 (5th Cir. 2001).\r\n<p>8. </p></span><span>In her post-deposition affidavit, LeBlanc stated: \"Tony Barrientos agreed with me\r\nthat Ms. Peveto was discriminating against me and weighting the test so that Barbara Sarver\r\nwould have higher scores than me and [Peveto] could recommend [Sarver] based upon the\r\nscores of a discriminatory test.\"  LeBlanc further stated: \"I went into work on several\r\noccasions and there would be boxes obstructing my path.  It was my understanding from\r\nwhat I was told that Ms. Peveto placed the objects in my pathway to harass me.  To the best\r\nof my recollection it was Tony that told me.  I understood him to mean that she put them\r\nthere to obstruct my path. Ms. Peveto also put the tests that I was to administer in a filing\r\ncabinet in a drawer that she knew was above my reach.  Tony and I both believed she did this\r\nintentionally to harass and intimidate me.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn an affidavit presented by defendants, however, Tony Barrientos stated that he never\r\nobserved Peveto placing obstacles of any kind in the path of LeBlanc's wheelchair and never\r\nheard Peveto make any derogatory comment about LeBlanc's disability.  Barrientos further\r\nstated: \"Although Ms. LeBlanc and I had many conversations over the years and considered\r\none another friends, she never complained to me that anyone in the [Center] was placing\r\nobstacles in her path or that she was upset about the location of files.  The first I learned that\r\n[LeBlanc] was voicing such complaints was after this lawsuit was filed.\" He also said that\r\nhe believed the test taken by LeBlanc and Sarver \"fairly assessed the skills required for the\r\nposition.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
