This appeal requires us to review\n\ncertain features of a voluntary plan designed to achieve the\n\neducational benefits of racial diversity in the public schools of\n\nLynn, Massachusetts (\"Lynn Plan\" or \"Plan\").                The Plan addresses\n\nresource allocation, curricula, and other aspects of the classroom\n\nexperience.    Relevant to this appeal, it also controls school\n\nassignments   and   transfers.        Under    the   Plan,    each    student    is\n\nentitled to attend his or her neighborhood school. Students who do\n\nnot wish to attend their neighborhood school may apply to transfer\n\nto another school.    Approval of a transfer depends, in large part,\n\non the requesting student's race and the racial makeup of the\n\ntransferor and transferee schools.\n\n           Parents whose children were denied transfers on race-\n\nconscious grounds challenged the transfer provisions of the Lynn\n\nPlan,   claiming,   inter    alia,    that    the    provisions      violate    the\n\nFourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause.               The district court\n\nrejected the parents' challenges and upheld the Plan.                 A panel of\n\nthis court    reversed,     finding   that     the   Plan    was   not   narrowly\n\ntailored to the defendants' compelling interest in achieving the\n\nbenefits of educational diversity.            We granted review en banc and\n\nnow affirm.\n\n           Our review of the equal protection challenge is informed\n\nby the Supreme Court's recent decisions regarding affirmative\n\naction in higher education, Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f(2003), and Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244 (2003).              We conclude,\n\nbased on those cases, that Lynn has a compelling interest in\n\nsecuring the educational benefits of racial diversity.                  Applying\n\nthe analytic framework set forth in Grutter and Gratz to the\n\ncontext of a K-12, non-competitive transfer plan, we hold that the\n\nLynn Plan is narrowly tailored to meet this compelling interest.\n\n            The plaintiffs assert a number of other claims as well.\n\nWe do not reach the merits of their facial challenge to the\n\nMassachusetts     Racial   Imbalance    Act,   which      fails   for   lack   of\n\nstanding.    We treat the plaintiffs' federal statutory claims as\n\nforeclosed   by    our   equal    protection     ruling    and    reject   their\n\nchallenge to the Plan under Article 111 of the Massachusetts\n\nDeclaration of Rights.       Finally, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt properly denied the plaintiffs' motion for recusal.\n\n                                 I. Background\n\n            This case comes to us with a rich factual background,\n\ndescribed in detail in a series of district court rulings.                     See\n\nComfort v. Lynn Sch. Comm., 283 F. Supp. 2d 328 (D. Mass. 2003)\n\n(Comfort IV); Comfort v. Lynn Sch. Comm., 150 F. Supp. 2d 285 (D.\n\nMass. 2001) (Comfort III); Comfort v. Lynn Sch. Comm., 131 F. Supp.\n\n2d 253 (D. Mass. 2001) (Comfort II); Comfort v. Lynn Sch. Comm.,\n\n100 F. Supp. 2d 57 (D. Mass. 2000) (Comfort I).             We set forth only\n\nthose facts necessary to put this case into context, drawing upon\n\nthe largely unchallenged findings of the district court.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fA. Lynn Public Schools\n\n          Lynn is the ninth-largest city in Massachusetts, with a\n\npopulation of approximately 89,000.           At all relevant times, its\n\nschool system has been neighborhood-centered, entitling students to\n\nattend their local schools as a matter of right.         By the mid-1970s,\n\nseveral of Lynn's schools were experiencing significant racial\n\nimbalance.      In   1977,   for   example,    the   Washington   Community\n\nElementary School had a nonwhite student population of 57%, more\n\nthan six times the nonwhite percentage in the school system as a\n\nwhole. Predominantly nonwhite schools suffered disproportionately\n\nfrom resource shortages, overcrowding, discipline problems, and\n\nteacher apathy.      The school system was plagued by high absentee\n\nrates, racial tension, and low test scores.\n\n             In an effort to combat these problems, Lynn established\n\nits first magnet school in 1979.       At the same time, it inaugurated\n\na voluntary transfer program aimed at attracting white students to\n\nthat school (which apparently was located in a predominantly\n\nnonwhite area of the city).        The magnet school was only modestly\n\nsuccessful in alleviating racial imbalance.\n\n             In the meantime, Lynn was undergoing a demographic shift.\n\nBetween 1980 and 2000, the city went from being 93% white to 63%\n\nwhite, with the school-age population becoming more than half\n\nnonwhite by 2000. Residential segregation by race increased during\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthis period as whites clustered in the northern and western areas\n\nof Lynn and nonwhites concentrated in its south-central region.\n\n             Because   of   the     neighborhood   school   system,   these\n\nresidential patterns heightened the racial imbalance of Lynn's\n\nschools.     By 1987, seven of eighteen elementary schools had white\n\nenrollments of 90% or more, while four others had predominantly\n\nnonwhite student bodies.          Lynn responded by developing a plan to\n\nlaunch ten magnet schools,1 but city leaders did not believe that\n\nthe magnet program, on its own, would effectively combat the\n\ngrowing racial imbalance.           In September 1989, the Lynn School\n\nCommittee (\"Lynn\") adopted the Plan that is the subject of this\n\nlitigation.2\n\nB. The Lynn Plan\n\n             The defendants describe the Lynn Plan as a voluntary plan\n\nfor school improvement and the elimination of minority isolation.\n\nThe Plan begins with the premise that every child is entitled to\n\nattend his or her neighborhood school.        Race is taken into account\n\n\n     1\n      Ordinarily, the label \"magnet school\" describes an elite\npublic school with a competitive admissions policy. Lynn's magnet\nschools, however, do not use a competitive admissions policy.\nRather, Lynn uses the term for schools that feature an educational\ntheme beyond the standard curriculum, designed partially to attract\ncross-neighborhood transfers.    Examples of such themes include\n\"Life Science\" and \"Reading and Writing Literary and Whole\nLanguage.\" Despite this specialization the parties have stipulated\nthat \"the education provided . . . in each of the elementary,\nmiddle, and high schools in Lynn is comparable in quality,\nresources[,] and curriculum.\"\n     2\n         The Plan was amended in 1990 and again in 1999.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fonly when a student seeks to transfer to a school other than his or\n\nher neighborhood school.\n\n           Lynn operates eighteen elementary schools (six of which\n\nare magnets), four middle schools (three of which have magnet\n\nprograms), and three high schools.3    In the 2001-02 school year,\n\n15,444 students were enrolled in the Lynn public schools.   Out of\n\nthis group, approximately 42% of students were white, 15% African-\n\nAmerican, 29% Hispanic, and 14% Asian (for a total \"minority\" or\n\nnonwhite population of roughly 58%).\n\n           For purposes of the Lynn Plan, schools are placed in one\n\nof three categories.   A \"racially balanced\" school is one in which\n\nthe percentage of nonwhite students falls within a set range of the\n\noverall proportion of minorities in Lynn's student population. The\n\nrange is +/- 15% for elementary schools and +/- 10% for other\n\nschools.   For example, an elementary school with between 43% and\n\n73% nonwhite students during the 2001-02 school year was considered\n\nracially balanced, as was a middle or high school that had a\n\nnonwhite enrollment of 48% to 68%.     In the 2001-02 school year,\n\nnine of Lynn's elementary schools, one of its middle schools, and\n\nall three of its high schools were racially balanced.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Lynn also operates six alternative schools, offering such\nthings as special needs education and vocational training. These\nschools are not subject to the transfer provisions of the Lynn\nPlan.\n\n                                -7-\n\f             If     a    school's       nonwhite        population    falls    below     the\n\nracially balanced range (i.e., if the percentage of nonwhite\n\nstudents in 2001-02 fell below 43% for an elementary school or 48%\n\nfor   a   middle        or    high     school),      it     is    \"racially    isolated.\"\n\nConversely, a school whose nonwhite population rises above the\n\nracially balanced range (i.e., over 73% for an elementary school or\n\n68%   for    a    middle         or   high    school)       is    considered       \"racially\n\nimbalanced.\" In 2001-02, five of Lynn's elementary schools and one\n\nof its middle schools were classified as racially isolated, while\n\nfour elementary schools and two middle schools were racially\n\nimbalanced.\n\n             The        transfer       policy       is     straightforward.             Space\n\npermitting,       a     student       whose   neighborhood         school     is    racially\n\nbalanced may transfer to another racially balanced school without\n\nregard to race.              Because all three of Lynn's high schools are\n\ncurrently racially balanced, for example, students may transfer\n\nfreely      among       them.         Students      are    also    permitted       to    make\n\n\"desegregative\" transfers.                That is, a white student may transfer\n\nout of a racially isolated school and into a racially imbalanced\n\nschool    (i.e.,        to   a   school      with   a     lower   percentage       of   white\n\nstudents), and a nonwhite student may transfer out of a racially\n\nimbalanced school and into a racially isolated school (i.e., to a\n\nschool with a lower percentage of nonwhite students). By contrast,\n\nabsent certain exceptions, students may not make \"segregative\"\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\ftransfers.     A segregative transfer is one that would exacerbate\n\nracial imbalance in the sending or receiving school (i.e., a white\n\nstudent may not transfer to a racially isolated school, and a\n\nnonwhite    student   may   not   transfer    to   a   racially   imbalanced\n\nschool).4\n\n             A student whose transfer request is denied is entitled to\n\nappeal.     Roughly half of all appeals are granted.        Common grounds\n\nfor successful appeals are medical and safety concerns, daycare\n\nissues, and other types of hardship.         Appeals will also be granted\n\nwhen the denial would result in siblings attending different\n\nschools.    The Plan is implemented by the Parent Information Center\n\n(\"PIC\"), which processes all admissions and transfers, works with\n\nparents on appeals, and monitors enrollment and racial composition\n\nof individual schools and the district in general.\n\n             As the plaintiffs point out, the Lynn Plan can result in\n\nunequal treatment based on race.             Consider, for example, two\n\nchildren, one white and one African-American, who are initially\n\nassigned to the same neighborhood elementary school for the 2001-02\n\nschool year.    The school is racially isolated (i.e., less than 43%\n\nminority).     Both children request a transfer to a nearby school\n\nthat is racially imbalanced (i.e., greater than 73% minority).\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Any student who qualifies as \"multi-racial\" is not subject to\nthe race-conscious transfer limits.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fUnder the Plan, the white student will be permitted to transfer,\n\nand the African-American student will not.\n\n             Although the race-conscious transfer policy is the focus\n\nof    this   appeal,     the   Lynn    Plan    also   includes   numerous       other\n\nprovisions aimed at improving the quality of all schools in the\n\ndistrict.     It calls for curricular programs and teacher training\n\ndesigned to foster cross-racial understanding and reduce racial\n\ntension.     It also implemented a standardized curriculum throughout\n\nLynn's schools;         developed     performance     indicators      for   schools,\n\nprograms and students; took measures to improve student attendance;\n\nand created business/college partnerships with schools to improve\n\nthe    quality     of   instruction.      Finally,       the   Plan    envisions    a\n\nconstruction program to upgrade school facilities and alleviate\n\novercrowding.\n\n             All    parties    agree    that    Lynn's    public      schools    have\n\nimproved markedly since the Plan's inception, although they dispute\n\nwhich aspects of the Plan are responsible for this improvement. In\n\nany event, students' standardized test scores have increased,\n\nabsentee levels have decreased, and racial tensions have diminished\n\nunder the Plan.\n\nC. The Racial Imbalance Act\n\n             The Racial Imbalance Act (\"RIA\"), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 15,\n\n§§ 1I, 1J, 1K; id. ch. 71, §§ 37C, 37D, directs the Massachusetts\n\nBoard of Education to remedy de facto segregation in the public\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fschools throughout the state.   See Sch. Comm. of Boston v. Bd. of\n\nEduc., 227 N.E.2d 729, 732 (Mass. 1967).      The legislature enacted\n\nthe RIA in response to findings that dramatic levels of racial\n\nimbalance in the public schools threatened to harm students'\n\neducational opportunities.    See id. at 733-34.       The RIA has two\n\nmain effects: it authorizes the Board to fund voluntary efforts to\n\nimprove racial balance, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 15, § 1I, and it allows\n\nthe Board to require that school districts adopt integration plans\n\nin certain circumstances, id. ch. 71, § 37D.\n\n           The Lynn school system has received significant state aid\n\nunder the voluntary provisions of the RIA. These funds have helped\n\npay for new construction and school renovations.5             Lynn also\n\nreceives a state stipend of $500 for each desegregative student\n\ntransfer, and the state defrays certain costs associated with\n\ncross-neighborhood   transportation    and   the   creation   of   magnet\n\nschools.\n\nD. Procedural History\n\n           In 1999, the parents of children who had been denied\n\ntransfers under the Lynn Plan (\"Comfort plaintiffs\") brought a\n\ncivil action against the Lynn School Committee, its individual\n\nmembers, and several governmental officials. They claimed that the\n\n\n     5\n      Before 2001, the RIA provided reimbursement for school\nconstruction and renovations undertaken for the purpose of reducing\nracial imbalance. The law has been amended to change this funding\nstructure, but that amendment applies prospectively and does not\naffect Lynn's state funding.\n\n                                -11-\n\fLynn Plan and the RIA violate the Fourteenth Amendment Equal\n\nProtection Clause, several federal civil rights statutes, and\n\nArticle 111 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.                           The\n\nCommonwealth intervened as a party defendant for the limited\n\npurpose of defending the RIA.               See 28 U.S.C. § 2403(b).              The\n\ndistrict court denied a motion to preliminarily enjoin the race-\n\nconscious aspects of the Lynn Plan, see Comfort I, 100 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 59-60, and dismissed several of the plaintiffs' claims, see\n\nComfort III, 150 F. Supp. 2d at 289, 296-97, 302; Comfort II, 131\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 254, 256.                Only one of the original Comfort\n\nplaintiffs     remains     in     the     case.       Other     parents     (\"Bollen\n\nplaintiffs\") then filed a second action that included the Comfort\n\nplaintiffs' claims, as well as other statutory claims.                    The Bollen\n\nplaintiffs also added as defendants the members of the Board of\n\nEducation    in    their   official       capacities.         The   district    court\n\nconsolidated the two cases.\n\n             Following an eleven-day bench trial, the district court\n\nissued   a   lengthy     opinion    dismissing       a    number     of   the   Bollen\n\nplaintiffs' claims on standing grounds.                  Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 361-63.       It rejected the facial attack on the RIA, id. at\n\n366-68, and determined that the Plan's transfer provisions are\n\nnarrowly tailored to several compelling state interests, and thus\n\nconstitutional.        Id. at 375-92.             The court also rejected the\n\nplaintiffs'       remaining     federal    statutory       claims,    treating    the\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fstatutory provisions as co-extensive with the Equal Protection\n\nClause.   Id. at 392-93.       Finally, the court held that the transfer\n\nprovisions of the Lynn Plan did not violate Article 111 of the\n\nMassachusetts Declaration of Rights.            Id. at 393-400.\n\n            A panel of this court reversed, holding that the Plan\n\ncould not the survive strict scrutiny review required by the Equal\n\nProtection Clause.         Relying on the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nGrutter   upholding    a    race-conscious      admissions     policy   at   the\n\nUniversity     of   Michigan    Law   School,    the   panel    recognized    a\n\ncompelling interest in \"obtaining the educational benefits of a\n\nracially diverse student body.\"          Comfort v. Lynn Sch. Comm., No.\n\n03-2415, slip op. at 30 (1st Cir. Oct. 20, 2004), withdrawn by 2004\n\nWL 2348505 (1st Cir. Nov. 24, 2004).            It concluded, however, that\n\nthe Plan is not narrowly tailored to that interest because it uses\n\nrace \"mechanically\" and \"forgoes individualized consideration of\n\ntransfer applications.\"         Id. at 40.      The panel also cited other\n\nnarrow tailoring flaws, including the Plan's breadth and indefinite\n\nduration.     We granted en banc rehearing and now affirm.6\n\n                                 II. Standing\n\n             \"[T]he general rule is that a court should first confirm\n\nthe existence of rudiments such as jurisdiction and standing before\n\ntackling the merits of a controverted case.\"           Berner v. Delahanty,\n\n\n\n     6\n      We express our appreciation to the many amici curiae for\ntheir valuable assistance.\n\n                                      -13-\n\f129 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1997).        This is because \"standing is a\n\nnecessary concomitant to the court's power to adjudicate a case.\"\n\nR.I. Ass'n of Realtors v. Whitehouse, 199 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   Thus, we begin by considering the plaintiffs' standing.\n\n           To establish standing in federal court, a party must\n\ndemonstrate three things:\n\n     First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in\n     fact\" -- an invasion of a legally protected interest\n     which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual\n     or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. Second,\n     there must be a causal connection between the injury and\n     the conduct complained of -- the injury has to be fairly\n     traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and\n     not the result of the independent action of some third\n     party not before the court. Third, it must be likely, as\n     opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be\n     redressed by a favorable decision.\n\nLujan v.   Defenders   of   Wildlife,   504   U.S.   555,   560-61   (1992)\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).           The plaintiffs\n\nmust have standing to obtain both forms of relief they seek: an\n\ninjunction against the race-conscious aspects of the Plan and a\n\ndeclaration that the RIA is facially unconstitutional. See Friends\n\nof the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S.\n\n167, 185 (2000).\n\n           With respect to the Lynn Plan, one Bollen plaintiff (Gina\n\nLeone) clearly meets the threshold standing requirement.             Leone\n\nsues on behalf of her minor son, Troy Lamothe, whose transfer\n\nrequest was denied on the ground that it would be segregative. The\n\nfact that Troy was allowed to attend the school of his choice\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fpending the outcome of this litigation does not defeat standing.\n\nSee Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 735 n.3\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (accepting plaintiff's standing despite agreement\n\nnot to enforce disputed ordinance pending outcome of litigation).\n\nSo long as one plaintiff has standing to seek a particular form of\n\nglobal relief, the court need not address the standing of other\n\nplaintiffs seeking the same relief.      See Watt v. Energy Action\n\nEduc. Found., 454 U.S. 151, 160 (1981); Houlton Citizens' Coalition\n\nv. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 183 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            Standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief against\n\nthe RIA is a different matter.      The parties stipulated, and the\n\ndistrict court confirmed, that the mandatory portion of the RIA\n\n(i.e., the provision under which the Board of Education can require\n\na district to adopt a plan to reduce racial imbalance) has not been\n\napplied to Lynn.      Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 367.        The\n\nplaintiffs nevertheless launch a facial attack against the RIA's\n\nmandatory provisions, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, § 37D, contending\n\nthat they offend the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause\n\nand Article 111 of the Massachusetts Constitution by giving white\n\nchildren a right to transfer out of isolated schools and nonwhite\n\nchildren a right to transfer out of imbalanced schools, but not\n\nvice versa (i.e., white children cannot transfer out of imbalanced\n\nschools and nonwhite children cannot transfer out of isolated\n\nschools).    Even if that is true in theory, the plaintiffs cannot\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fovercome the fact that only a person who was denied a transfer on\n\nthe basis of the mandatory provisions of the RIA has standing to\n\nchallenge them.\n\n            The mandatory provisions of § 37D apply only to school\n\ndistricts    that   refuse   to   create   voluntary   plans   to    combat\n\nidentified racial imbalance.      See Sch. Comm. of Springfield v. Bd.\n\nof Educ., 319 N.E.2d 427, 429 (Mass. 1974).       Lynn never refused to\n\ntake action; rather, it drafted and implemented a voluntary plan.\n\nThe plaintiffs therefore have not suffered a cognizable injury from\n\n§ 37D of the RIA.7       Accordingly, they lack standing to seek a\n\ndeclaration as to its validity.\n\n            The plaintiffs also lack standing to seek injunctive or\n\ndeclaratory relief against the RIA provisions that offer incentives\n\nto   districts   that   voluntarily   adopt   plans    to   combat   racial\n\nimbalance.    See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 15, §§ 1I, 1J, 1K; id. ch. 71,\n\n§ 37C.    Redressability, one of the prerequisites for standing, see\n\nN.H. Right to Life PAC v. Gardner, 99 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1996),\n\nrequires a substantial likelihood that the relief sought will in\n\nfact remedy the alleged injury, Bonas v. Town of N. Smithfield, 265\n\nF. 3d 69, 73 n.4 (1st Cir. 2001).     Plaintiffs describe their injury\n\nas both a racially-based denial of transfers and the stigma of\n\ntheir inability to \"compete\" on equal terms for transfers.              Even\n\n\n\n      7\n      Nor have the plaintiffs shown that they are               under   any\nimminent threat of being subjected to these mandates.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fassuming arguendo that this asserted injury is somehow traceable to\n\nthe RIA, the plaintiffs cannot show that an injunction against the\n\nRIA's incentive provisions will lead to racially unrestricted\n\ntransfers within the Lynn public schools or eliminate the perceived\n\nstigmatic harm.\n\n           This point is apparent from the record.   Under the terms\n\nof the RIA, Lynn has received state funding for construction and\n\nbusing based on its voluntary efforts to combat racial imbalance.\n\nEven if we directed the Board to distribute aid without regard to\n\nracial balancing efforts, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that\n\nredress would likely follow.    There is no reason to believe that\n\nLynn would cancel its transfer program merely because state funding\n\nwas no longer contingent on it.\n\n           In an effort to sustain their claim, the plaintiffs and\n\namicus Pacific Legal Foundation also present a second theory for\n\nprospective relief.   They assert that the incentive provisions of\n\nthe RIA are effectively mandatory because they coerce school\n\ndistricts to adopt race-conscious plans by tying state aid to the\n\nadoption of those plans.   There is a flaw in this argument.   While\n\nthe RIA's incentive provisions reward schools that address racial\n\nimbalance, they do not dictate a procedure or methodology by which\n\nschools must do so.   See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 15, § 1I; id. ch. 71,\n\n§ 37C.   Given the absence of a requirement that schools adopt race-\n\nconscious plans to comply with the RIA, the plaintiffs have not\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fshown that       the   incentive   provisions    of    the    RIA   are   causally\n\nresponsible for the voluntary adoption of race-conscious transfer\n\npolicies.\n\n            Even if the plaintiffs did have standing to mount a\n\nfacial challenge to the voluntary provisions of the RIA, we agree\n\nwith the district court that such a challenge would fail.                  Comfort\n\nIV,   283   F.   Supp.   2d   at   367-68.      \"A    facial    challenge       to   a\n\nlegislative Act is . . . the most difficult challenge to mount\n\nsuccessfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of\n\ncircumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\"                      United\n\nStates v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987).                 Such circumstances\n\nexist here. As the district court recognized, \"[a] school district\n\nmay theoretically adopt a plan that improves racial imbalance\n\nwithout     explicitly     introducing   race-based          criteria     at   all.\"\n\nComfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 367-68 & n.77 (noting that \"if a\n\nsmall district with racially identifiable school attendance zones\n\nbuilt a single central elementary, middle, and high school to\n\nabsorb its entire enrolled student populations, this strategy would\n\nqualify as a racial balancing plan under the RIA, and it would not\n\ntrigger any equal protection scrutiny\"); see also Boston's Children\n\nFirst v. Boston Sch. Comm., 260 F. Supp. 2d 318, 327 (D. Mass.\n\n2003) (finding that the RIA's goals may be satisfied by race-\n\nneutral methods), aff'd sub nom. Anderson v. City of Boston, 375\n\nF.3d 71 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f                  III. Federal Equal Protection Claims\n\n              The main issue on appeal is the constitutionality of the\n\nLynn Plan's race-conscious transfer restrictions.          The plaintiffs\n\ncontend that by mechanically taking race into account, the Plan\n\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nand various federal civil rights statutes.           The resolution of the\n\nfederal statutory claims depends on the fate of the constitutional\n\nchallenge.      See infra Part III.D.     Consequently, we focus on the\n\nequal protection issue.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n              We review the court's findings of fact for clear error\n\nand its legal conclusions, including its application of the law to\n\nthe facts, de novo.       See Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790, 795\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              The Supreme Court has reviewed racial classifications\n\nunder the strict scrutiny standard, which requires that the policy\n\nbe narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest.            Grutter, 539\n\nU.S. at 326; Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227\n\n(1995).   The defendants urge us to apply a more relaxed standard\n\nhere.   They emphasize that although the Plan is race-conscious, it\n\nis   unlike    affirmative   action   because   it    affects    whites   and\n\nnonwhites equally.\n\n              This argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's recent\n\ndecision in Johnson v. California, 125 S. Ct. 1141 (2005).           There,\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fthe   Court      considered        an   unwritten       policy    of    the    California\n\nDepartment of Corrections whereby inmates are segregated by race\n\nfor up to sixty days after entering a new correctional facility.\n\nRejecting the State's argument that its policy should be subjected\n\nto relaxed scrutiny because it \"neither benefits nor burdens one\n\ngroup or individual more than any other group or individual,\" id.\n\nat 1147, the Court explained that all racial classifications\n\n      raise special fears that they are motivated by an\n      invidious purpose.    Thus, we have admonished time and\n      again that, \"[a]bsent searching judicial inquiry into the\n      justification for such race-based measures, there is\n      simply no way of determining . . . what classifications\n      are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial\n      inferiority or simple racial politics.\" Richmond v. J.A.\n      Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion).\n      We therefore apply strict scrutiny to all racial\n      classifications to smoke out illegitimate uses of race by\n      assuring that [government] is pursuing a goal important\n      enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool.\n\nId. at 1146 (internal quotation marks omitted).                        This rule applies\n\nin the present context just as firmly.                   The Plan must be reviewed\n\nunder strict scrutiny.\n\n              This standard is not \"strict in theory, but fatal in\n\nfact.\"      Id.    at    1151;      see   also    Grutter,       539    U.S.   at   326-27\n\n(\"Although all governmental uses of race are subject to strict\n\nscrutiny, not all are invalidated by it.\").                      Strict scrutiny \"is\n\ndesigned    to    provide      a    framework     for     carefully       examining      the\n\nimportance     and      the   sincerity     of    the    reasons       advanced     by   the\n\ngovernmental decisionmaker for the use of race in that particular\n\ncontext.\"     Grutter, 539 U.S. at 327.             We therefore bear in mind the\n\n                                           -20-\n\fcourt's admonition that \"[c]ontext matters when reviewing race-\n\nbased governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.\"                 Id.\n\nB. Compelling State Interest\n\n            Until recently, there was some question as to whether\n\ndiversity could constitute a compelling interest in the educational\n\ncontext.    See Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 795-96.         The Supreme Court has\n\nnow answered that question in the affirmative, holding in Grutter\n\nthat a law school's interest in obtaining the educational benefits\n\nthat flow from a diverse student body was compelling enough to\n\njustify the narrowly tailored use of race in admissions.              539 U.S.\n\nat 343.\n\n            Grutter   involved     a    challenge    to   the    University   of\n\nMichigan Law School's admissions policy, which took into account\n\nracial and ethnic background as one of several \"soft variables\"\n\nused in assessing applicants.             Id. at 315.           The Law School\n\njustified this strategy as furthering its goal of assembling a\n\nclass that was both \"exceptionally . . . qualified and broadly\n\ndiverse.\"    Id. at 329.      It also sought to enroll a \"critical mass\"\n\nof   minority    students,    thereby    enhancing    its   quest    for   broad\n\ndiversity.      Id. at 330.\n\n            The Grutter Court stressed that the Law School's plan did\n\nnot pursue a critical mass of minority students for its own sake,\n\nbut rather for the sake of obtaining the educational benefits that\n\nflow from having a racially diverse student body.                Id. at 329-30\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\f(acknowledging        that    racial     balancing       for   its    own     sake    is\n\nunconstitutional).           These educational benefits include promoting\n\ncross-racial understanding, breaking down stereotypes, fostering\n\nlivelier and better informed class discussions, and preparing\n\nstudents to succeed in an increasingly diverse society.                        Id. at\n\n330.     The Court largely deferred to the Law School's educational\n\njudgment not only in determining that diversity would produce these\n\nbenefits, but also in determining that these benefits were critical\n\nto the school's educational mission.                 Id. at 328-33.         The Court\n\nwarned, however, that \"scrutiny of the interest asserted by the Law\n\nSchool    is    no    less    strict    for     taking    into      account    complex\n\neducational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the\n\nexpertise of the university.\" Id. at 328. Nevertheless, the Court\n\nconcluded      that    the    pursuit    of    these     benefits     constituted      a\n\ncompelling state interest.             Id.    In so ruling, it recognized \"the\n\noverriding importance of [education in] preparing students for work\n\nand citizenship.\"        Id. at 331.\n\n               Against this background, we consider the interest that\n\nLynn's race-conscious Plan seeks to advance.                   This is not a case\n\nwhere    the    racial    classification        is     aimed   at    remedying       past\n\nsegregation.          See Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 390 n.101.\n\nRather, the parties stipulated that Lynn's interests\n\n       include fostering integrated public schools and what Lynn\n       believes are [their] positive effects; reducing minority\n       isolation and avoiding segregation and what Lynn believes\n       are their negative effects; promoting a positive racial\n\n                                         -22-\n\f      climate at schools and a safe and healthy school\n      environment; fostering a cohesive and tolerant community\n      in Lynn; promoting diversity; ensuring equal education\n      and life opportunities and increasing the quality of\n      education for all students.\n\n           The district court grouped these interests into two\n\ncategories: (i) reaping the educational benefits that flow from\n\nhaving a racially diverse student body in each of Lynn's public\n\nschools, and (ii) avoiding the negative educational consequences\n\nthat accompany racial isolation.\n\n           Although   there    are    some    differences     between   these\n\ninterests, we conclude that they are essentially two sides of the\n\nsame coin. The negative consequences of racial isolation that Lynn\n\nseeks to avoid and the benefits of diversity that it hopes to\n\nachieve are rooted in the same central idea: that all students are\n\nbetter off in racially diverse schools.            We therefore restate the\n\ninterests at stake here as obtaining the educational benefits of a\n\nracially diverse student body.\n\n           Lynn maintains that ensuring a racially diverse student\n\nbody in its schools has produced, and will continue to produce,\n\nmany of the same benefits cited by the Grutter Court: disarming\n\nracial stereotypes, increasing racial tolerance, and preparing\n\nstudents to live and work in an increasingly multi-racial society.\n\nThe   defendants'   expert    evidence      also   suggests   that   racially\n\nisolated students often feel psychological burdens that can lead to\n\npoor attendance and academic woes, and that these effects can be\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fcombated by racial integration.           Consistent with these assertions,\n\nLynn's schools have indeed experienced many positive developments\n\n-- including higher attendance rates, declining suspension rates,\n\na safer environment, and improved standardized test scores -- since\n\nthe Plan's inception.\n\n               In Lynn's view, these developments can be explained by\n\nthe intergroup contact theory.                This theory holds that \"under\n\ncertain conditions, interaction between students of different races\n\npromotes empathy, understanding, positive racial attitudes[,] and\n\nthe disarming of stereotypes.\"           Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 356.\n\nUnder    the     intergroup    contact       theory,      there       are   four    basic\n\nconditions for success: (1) equal status among racial groups, (2)\n\nthe     presence    of     teachers    and     staff      trained      to    facilitate\n\ninteractions between members of different groups, (3) common goals\n\nand cooperative activities, and (4) opportunities for personalized\n\ncontact with a sufficient number of children from different racial\n\ngroups to disrupt stereotypes.            Id. at 356-57.\n\n               Lynn's    experts    explained      that    meaningful        intergroup\n\ncontact    (the    fourth     condition       of   intergroup         contact      theory)\n\nrequires that a school have a \"critical mass\" of students of each\n\ngroup, i.e., white and nonwhite.              Id. at 357.       Lynn's experts also\n\ntestified, and the district court found, that the benefits of\n\nintergroup       contact    continue     to    accrue      as     a    school      becomes\n\nincreasingly diverse.         Id.     Citing this theory and crediting the\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\fdefense experts who explained its application in Lynn, the district\n\ncourt agreed that there was a causal link between improvements in\n\nthe school system and increased racial diversity.              Id. at 353-54.\n\n           While acknowledging improvements in the Lynn schools\n\nsince the Plan's inception, the plaintiffs disagree that these\n\nchanges can be attributed to the race-conscious aspect of the Lynn\n\nPlan.    More significantly, they also contend that regardless of\n\nwhether there are educational benefits to racial diversity, Lynn\n\ndoes not have a compelling interest in achieving those benefits.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n           Lynn's transfer policy expressly aims at attaining racial\n\ndiversity in the city's schools.          Where a community does not seek\n\nracial   diversity   for   its   own    sake,   but   rather   to   advance   a\n\ncompelling interest in the educational benefits that diversity\n\nprovides, there is no absolute bar to pursuing racial diversity.\n\nSee Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330.          The district court found that this\n\nwas Lynn's purpose, Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 375-76, and the\n\nrecord supports that finding. We see no reason to second-guess it.\n\nCf. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 328 (stating that, typically, a school's\n\n\"educational judgment that . . . diversity is essential to                its\n\neducational mission is one to which we defer\").\n\n           The plaintiffs assert that, unlike Grutter, this case\n\ndoes not implicate a compelling interest that would justify the\n\npursuit of racial diversity.           The admissions plan at issue in\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fGrutter strove for diversity along many axes, including race, in an\n\neffort to create a student body with diverse viewpoints, thereby\n\nenriching classroom discussion and academic experiences.   See 539\n\nU.S. at 329 (\"As part of its goal of assembling a class that is\n\n. . . broadly diverse, the Law School seeks to enroll a critical\n\nmass of minority students.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that Grutter's recognition of a compelling\n\ninterest in \"the educational benefits that flow from student body\n\ndiversity,\"   539 U.S. at 330, is thus limited to the benefits that\n\nflow from viewpoint diversity in the higher education context and\n\ndoes not extend to the benefits that flow from racial diversity in\n\nthe K-12 context.\n\n          Again, we disagree.    Lynn's asserted interests bear a\n\nstrong familial resemblance to those that the Grutter Court found\n\ncompelling. There is no reason to believe that these interests are\n\nadvanced by viewpoint diversity but not racial diversity, or that\n\nthey are substantially stronger in the context of higher education\n\nthan in the context of elementary and secondary education.     See\n\nMcFarland v. Jefferson Cty. Pub. Schs., 330 F. Supp. 2d 834, 852-53\n\n(W.D. Ky. 2004) (reasoning that the benefits recognized in Grutter\n\nalso \"accrue to students in racially integrated public schools\");\n\ncf. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221 (1982) (emphasizing the\n\nimportance of K-12 education \"in maintaining the fabric of our\n\nsociety\").    In fact, there is significant evidence in the record\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fthat the benefits of a racially diverse school are more compelling\n\nat younger ages.    See, e.g., Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 356\n\n(summarizing expert's testimony that \"[i]t is more difficult to\n\nteach racial tolerance to college-age students; the time to do it\n\nis when the students are still young, before they are locked into\n\nracialized thinking\").\n\n            The plaintiffs correctly point out that the benefits\n\nattributed to the Lynn Plan are not identical to those described in\n\nGrutter. But Grutter teaches that the compelling state interest in\n\ndiversity should be judged in relation to the educational benefits\n\nthat it seeks to produce.     539 U.S. at 330.    The Lynn Plan uses\n\nrace in pursuit of many of the same benefits that were cited\n\napprovingly by the Grutter Court, including breaking down racial\n\nbarriers,   promoting   cross-racial   understanding,   and   preparing\n\nstudents for a world in which \"race unfortunately still matters.\"\n\nId. at 333.8    There are, of course, some variances between the\n\nbenefits sought.    For example, the law school plan at issue in\n\nGrutter focused on the advantages of viewpoint diversity in the\n\nclassroom, while Lynn emphasizes the positive impact of racial\n\ndiversity on student safety and attendance. But it is natural that\n\nsafety and attendance issues will loom larger in elementary and\n\nsecondary schools than in graduate schools.       Conversely, lively\n\n\n     8\n      Notably, one of the studies that the Supreme Court cited as\ndemonstrating that diversity produces educational benefits was\nauthored by the defendants' expert in this case, Dr. Gary Orfield.\n\n                                -27-\n\fclassroom discussion is a more central form of learning in law\n\nschools (which prefer the Socratic method) than in a K-12 setting.\n\nThese differences do not negate a compelling interest in racial\n\ndiversity in a K-12 setting.       Instead, they are the logical result\n\nof context.\n\n            We are persuaded by the extensive expert testimony in the\n\nrecord, rooted in observations specific to Lynn, that there are\n\nsignificant educational benefits to be derived from a racially\n\ndiverse student body in the K-12 context.             Lynn has a compelling\n\ninterest in obtaining those benefits. See Brewer v. W. Irondequoit\n\nCent. Sch. Dist., 212 F.3d 738, 752 (2d Cir. 2000); McFarland, 330\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 855.\n\nC.

Rather, the government's use of race must be narrowly\n\ntailored to achieve its compelling interest. See Grutter, 539 U.S.\n\nat 333.     \"The purpose of the narrow tailoring requirement is to\n\nensure that 'the means chosen 'fit' . . . th[e] compelling goal so\n\nclosely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for\n\nthe   classification      was    illegitimate     racial       prejudice   or\n\nstereotype.'\"      Id. (quoting Richmond, 488 U.S. at 493).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\f             Narrow tailoring generally requires the proponent to show\n\nthat a plan or practice is (i) necessary to the declared purpose,\n\n(ii) proportional to the declared purpose, and (iii) not more\n\nburdensome than necessary on third parties.                  See United States v.\n\nParadise, 480 U.S. 149, 171 (1987) (plurality opinion).                     It is a\n\ncontext-specific inquiry that must be \"calibrated to fit the\n\ndistinct     issues   raised\"    in    a   given     case,      taking     \"relevant\n\ndifferences into account.\"            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 334 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n            Although the Supreme Court has not yet considered a\n\nconstitutional challenge to a voluntary race-based transfer policy\n\nfor elementary and secondary schools, its recent opinions in\n\nGrutter and Gratz provide some guidance for our narrow tailoring\n\ninquiry into the use of race to obtain the educational benefits of\n\ndiversity.     Thus we consider these cases further.\n\n            1. Gratz and Grutter\n\n            Gratz     involved   a     challenge        to    the   University     of\n\nMichigan's    undergraduate      admissions        program.         The   University\n\nautomatically assigned twenty points -- one-fifth of the 100 points\n\nnecessary    to   guarantee   admission       --   to    an   applicant     from   an\n\nunderrepresented racial or ethnic minority group.                   Gratz, 539 U.S.\n\nat 255.     This twenty-point bonus effectively made race/ethnicity\n\ndeterminative for minimally qualified minority applicants.                    Id. at\n\n272.   Grutter involved a challenge to the University of Michigan\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fLaw School's admissions policy.             The Law School took race into\n\naccount as one of several variables in an individual's application.\n\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 340.         It assigned no mechanical score based on\n\nan applicant's race; instead, it considered race only as one of\n\nseveral possible ways in which an applicant could enrich the\n\ndiversity of the student body.            Id. at 315-16.\n\n            The     Supreme     Court     struck    down       the    undergraduate\n\nadmissions plan in Gratz while upholding the law school admissions\n\npolicy in Grutter.            In arriving at these decisions, the Court\n\nfollowed a four-part narrow tailoring inquiry.                       First, a race-\n\nconscious     program    cannot    institutionalize        a    quota    system    or\n\notherwise insulate one category of applicants from competition with\n\nanother solely because of race.                Id.; Gratz, 539 U.S. at 334.\n\nSecond,    the    government     must    consider    whether         there   are   any\n\nworkable, race-neutral alternatives.               Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339.\n\nThird, the plan must not \"unduly harm members of any racial group.\"\n\nId. at 341.      Fourth, the use of racial distinctions must be limited\n\nin time.    Id. at 342.\n\n            Much of this inquiry is relevant here despite significant\n\ndifferences between the competitive admissions plans at issue in\n\nGratz and Grutter and the Lynn Plan, which is non-competitive and\n\ngoverns only student transfers, not initial assignments.                           The\n\nrequirement      that   the    court    consider   race-neutral        alternatives\n\naddresses whether the Plan is necessary; if there were a race-\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\fneutral way to achieve the benefits of diversity and reduced racial\n\nisolation, the use of race would be unnecessary and therefore not\n\nnarrowly tailored.        The requirements that a race-conscious policy\n\nnot unduly harm members of any racial group and that it be limited\n\nin time minimize the scope of the Plan, ensuring that its use of\n\nrace   is     no    broader    than     necessary.      The    weight    of   these\n\nconsiderations may vary somewhat from the Grutter setting to ours,\n\nbut they remain applicable and we will return to them shortly.\n\n             The first Grutter criterion relating to competition,\n\nhowever, is less useful to our narrow tailoring inquiry.                        The\n\nUniversity     of    Michigan    admissions       policies    were   designed   to\n\n\"assemble a student body that is diverse in ways broader than\n\nrace.\"      Grutter, 539 U.S. at 340.           Individualized assessments, in\n\nwhich race was only one consideration among many, were the most\n\nnarrowly tailored way to achieve such diversity.                 The mechanical\n\nuse of race, by contrast, would preclude an admissions committee\n\nfrom     considering         students'     \"background,       experiences,      and\n\ncharacteristics         to     assess     [their]      individual       'potential\n\ncontribution to diversity.'\"              Gratz, 539 U.S. at 274 (quoting\n\nRegents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 317 (1978)\n\n(opinion of Powell, J.)).\n\n              Unlike the Gratz and Grutter policies, the Lynn Plan is\n\ndesigned     to     achieve    racial    diversity    rather    than    viewpoint\n\n\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fdiversity.9   The only relevant criterion, then, is a student's\n\nrace; individualized consideration beyond that is irrelevant to the\n\ncompelling interest.      Cf. Brewer, 212 F.3d at 752 (\"If reducing\n\nracial   isolation   is   --   standing   alone   --   a   constitutionally\n\npermissible goal, . . . then there is no more effective means of\n\nachieving that goal than to base decisions on race.\")\n\n           The concerns motivating the individualized consideration\n\nrequirement in a competitive, race-preferential admissions context\n\nthat focuses on diversity along a number of axes (e.g., the Gratz\n\nand Grutter policies) are simply not present in a non-competitive\n\nK-12 transfer policy aimed at racial diversity.            Because transfers\n\n\n     9\n      As we have already discussed, see supra Part III.B., the Lynn\nPlan's focus on racial diversity rather than viewpoint diversity is\nthe result of contextual differences between higher education,\nwhere the emphasis is on the exchange of ideas, and primary\neducation, where the emphasis is on fostering interracial\ncooperation.     The district court explained this point in\ndistinguishing Grutter, which was then pending before the Supreme\nCourt:\n     In contrast [to Grutter], the \"critical mass\" sought by\n     the Lynn Plan is different, because Lynn's goal is not\n     viewpoint diversity. As I have said, at the elementary,\n     middle, and high school level, the goal of teaching\n     socialization is at least as important as the subject\n     matter of instruction. The value of a diverse classroom\n     setting at these ages does not inhere in the range of\n     perspectives and experience that students can offer in\n     discussions; rather, diversity is valuable because it\n     enables students to learn racial tolerance by building\n     cross-racial relationships. In this context a meaningful\n     presence of racial minorities -- and of whites at\n     minority-dominated schools -- is crucial not only to\n     reducing feelings of tokenism, but also to disarming\n     stereotypes that students in the classroom majority might\n     harbor about students of other races.\nComfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 381 n.90.\n\n                                   -32-\n\funder the Lynn Plan are not tied to merit, the Plan's use of race\n\ndoes not risk imposing stigmatic harm by fueling the stereotype\n\nthat \"certain groups are unable to achieve success without special\n\nprotection.\"      Bakke, 438 U.S. at 298 (opinion of Powell, J.)\n\n(raising the possibility of stigmatic harm in the affirmative\n\naction context). There is also little chance that the decisive use\n\nof race in a plan concerned strictly with racial diversity creates\n\nthe unwarranted presumption that race is a proxy for viewpoint.\n\nSee Gratz, 539 U.S. at 271 (recognizing this as a risk when members\n\nof a group are favored based on a presumption that \"persons think\n\nin a manner associated with their race\"). Indeed, the Plan strives\n\nfor exactly the opposite result -- that is, to preempt racial\n\nstereotypes through intergroup contact.\n\n            The plaintiffs emphasize that the Supreme Court has also\n\ncriticized the mechanical use of race on the ground that it may\n\nbreed cross-racial tension.        As the Court recently explained in\n\nconsidering a prison policy of segregating prison inmates by race,\n\n      racial classifications threaten to . . . incite racial\n      hostility. Indeed, by insisting that inmates be housed\n      only with other inmates of the same race, it is possible\n      that prison officials will breed further hostility among\n      prisoners and reinforce racial and ethnic divisions. By\n      perpetuating the notion that race matters most, racial\n      segregation of inmates may exacerbate the very patterns\n      of [violence that it is] said to counteract.\n\nJohnson, 125 S. Ct. at 1147 (internal quotation marks, citations,\n\nand emphasis omitted). These concerns, however, are not applicable\n\nto   the   Lynn   Plan,   which   takes    race   into   account   to   foster\n\n                                    -33-\n\fintergroup contact rather than to segregate.        As the Johnson Court\n\nacknowledged, \"racial integration . . . tends to diffuse racial\n\ntensions and thus diminish interracial violence.\"        Id. (citing the\n\nopinion of former corrections officials and a study finding that\n\n\"the rate of violence between inmates segregated by race . . .\n\nsurpassed the rate among those racially integrated\").          The Lynn\n\nPlan validates this conclusion: by reducing racial isolation and\n\nincreasing intergroup contact, it has ameliorated racial and ethnic\n\ntension and bred interracial tolerance.       Comfort, 283 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 376.   We   therefore     see    no    reason   to impose a blanket\n\nprohibition on the use of race as a decisive factor in a student\n\ntransfer plan to further a compelling interest in obtaining the\n\neducational benefits of racial diversity.          If a non-competitive,\n\nvoluntary student transfer plan is otherwise narrowly tailored,\n\nindividualized consideration of each student is unnecessary.10\n\n          2. The Lynn Plan\n\n          The district court determined, and we agree, that the\n\nPlan's use of transfer limits to achieve racial diversity has\n\nproduced benefits central to Lynn's educational mission.11         Under\n\n\n     10\n      We note that this conclusion in no way rests on the\nadministrative difficulties that would be inherent in individually\nconsidering each of the thousands of transfer requests that Lynn\nreceives each year.   Administrative difficulty \"does not render\nconstitutional an otherwise problematic system.\" Gratz, 539 U.S.\nat 275.\n     11\n      Plaintiffs argue that improvements in Lynn schools cannot be\nattributable to racial diversity. They emphasize (i) that levels\n\n                                   -34-\n\fthe general narrow tailoring framework, however, we must also\n\nconsider   whether   the   Plan's    use   of   race   is   no    broader    than\n\nnecessary and whether race-neutral alternatives are available. See\n\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 339-42; see also Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of\n\nEduc., 476 U.S. 267, 280 n.6 (1986) (noting that the term \"narrowly\n\ntailored\" requires \"consideration of whether lawful alternative and\n\nless   restrictive   means   could    have      been   used\"     or   that   \"the\n\nclassification at issue must 'fit' with greater precision than any\n\nalternative means\").\n\n           a. Breadth\n\n           The defendants maintain that the Plan's use of race is\n\nminimally invasive.     First, it governs only voluntary transfers,\n\nrather than initial student assignments.                Instead of forcing\n\nchildren to attend schools far from their homes, as might be the\n\n\n\n\nof diversity vary at schools in the district; (ii) that at least\none school slipped below critical mass during the 2000-01 academic\nyear; and (iii) that defense experts testified that all schools\nthey visited -- including schools that had slipped below critical\nmass -- demonstrated the benefits that intergroup contact theory\nattributes to racial diversity.       Plaintiffs reason that the\nexperts' uniformly positive testimony is inconsistent with a theory\nthat increased diversity produces increased benefits, and that the\nbenefits must be attributable instead to race-neutral factors\npresent in equal measure throughout the district. We do not find\nthis argument persuasive. The defendants point out that although\nsome of Lynn's schools occasionally fall below critical mass, those\ndeviations are small and temporary. Students do not automatically\nforfeit the lessons learned from integration when they attend a\nschool with relatively short-term or marginal deviation from\ncritical mass.\n\n                                    -35-\n\fresult of a controlled choice plan,12 the Lynn Plan preserves the\n\ntraditional neighborhood school model.    Second, the Plan allows\n\nstudents to transfer freely between racially balanced schools and\n\nprovides an appeals process for students whose transfer requests\n\nare denied on racial grounds.13\n\n          The Plan is also less burdensome on third parties here\n\nthan in other contexts because of the nature of the \"benefit\" at\n\nissue, namely the grant of a transfer request.   Every child in Lynn\n\nis guaranteed a seat in a district where, as the parties have\n\nstipulated, every school provides a comparable education.       The\n\ndenial of a transfer under the Plan is therefore markedly different\n\nfrom the denial of a spot at a unique or selective educational\n\ninstitution.   See, e.g., Gratz, 539 U.S. at 251 (University of\n\nMichigan); Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 793 (Boston Latin School); cf.\n\n\n\n     12\n      Controlled choice plans are an alternative to neighborhood\nschool assignments.     See, e.g., Anderson, 375 F.3d at 74-77\n(describing controlled choice plans used by the Boston Public\nSchools). \"Under such programs, parents can choose among a select\nnumber of schools, but their choices and their likelihood of\ngetting their choice are controlled to help ensure a particular\nracial balance.\" Wendy Parker, The Legal Cost of the \"Split Double\nHeader\" of Gratz and Grutter, 31 Hastings Const. L.Q. 587, 603 n.76\n(2003).\n     13\n      Appeals are granted to unite siblings or when parents can\nshow a medical, safety, or other hardship, including one based on\ndaycare arrangements. The district court found that the Parent\nInformation Center (Lynn's central registration office) \"goes out\nof its way to make the appeals process accessible to everyone.\"\nComfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 349. Additionally, a student whose\nappeal is denied will be presented with alternative placement\noptions.\n\n                                  -36-\n\fWygant, 476 U.S. at 282-83 (\"Though hiring goals may burden some\n\ninnocent individuals, they simply do not impose the same kind of\n\ninjury   that   layoffs   impose.     Denial       of   a   future   employment\n\nopportunity is not as intrusive as loss of an existing job.\").\n\nThis is not to say that the denial imposes no harm at all; the\n\ntransfer request itself indicates that despite the availability of\n\na comparable education at any school in Lynn, students (or their\n\nparents) do not view the schools as fungible.               But in construing\n\nthe narrow tailoring requirement that a race-conscious plan not\n\nunduly harm members of any racial group, we view the diminished\n\nnature of any harm here as significant.\n\n           i. Calibration\n\n           Despite the minimally invasive nature of the Plan, the\n\nplaintiffs contend that it imposes undue harm because of its\n\ncalibration.     Emphasizing the defense experts' testimony that the\n\neducational benefits of diversity are predicated on the presence of\n\na critical mass of white and nonwhite students, a figure that\n\nsocial science literature approximates at 20%, the plaintiffs\n\nassert that the Plan's numerical guidelines are substantially more\n\nrestrictive     than   necessary.    In    their    view,    a   plan   narrowly\n\ntailored to the defendants' compelling interest in the benefits of\n\neducational diversity would prohibit only those transfers that\n\nwould upset critical mass.     They point out that because the Plan is\n\ncalibrated around district demographics rather than around critical\n\n\n                                    -37-\n\fmass, it prohibits some transfers that do not bring a school\n\npopulation below 20% white. For example, because nonwhites made up\n\n58%   of   Lynn's     student      population     at    the   time    of    trial,   an\n\nelementary school with a 40% nonwhite enrollment qualified as\n\nracially isolated, and therefore subject to transfer limits, even\n\nthough     it    contained     a    critical     mass   of    white   and    nonwhite\n\nstudents.14\n\n                In response, the defendants rely on expert testimony that\n\nwhile critical mass is the point at which educational benefits\n\nbegin to accrue, those benefits increase as a school nears an even\n\nbalance between white and nonwhite students.                     Relying on this\n\nevidence, the district court found that \"gains occur along a\n\ncontinuum: as the racial composition of school populations creeps\n\ncloser to balanced, racial stereotyping and tension is [sic]\n\nreduced and racial harmony and understanding increase.\"                       Comfort\n\nIV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 357.             It thus concluded that the Plan was\n\nnarrowly        tailored,    despite     its     orientation     around      district\n\ndemographics rather than critical mass.                 See id. at 384 (The Plan\n\n\"effectively       generates       integration    in    Lynn's   schools      in   such\n\nquantity as to catalyze intergroup contact while still respecting\n\n\n\n      14\n      Under the Plan, an elementary school is racially isolated if\nits nonwhite enrollment falls more than 15% below the percentage of\nLynn's total student population that is nonwhite.        If Lynn's\nstudent population was 58% nonwhite, as it was during the 2001-02\nacademic year, a school whose student body was less than 43%\nnonwhite (i.e., more than 15% below 58%) was racially isolated.\n\n                                         -38-\n\fthe   neighborhood           school   principle      and     Lynn's   ever-changing\n\ndemographics.\").\n\n             We agree with the district court's reasoning.                 The Plan\n\ndoes not seek racial balancing for its own sake, nor does it use\n\nrigid quotas to ensure a pre-determined level of diversity at each\n\nof Lynn's schools.            See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 335-36 (\"The . . .\n\ngoal of attaining a critical mass of [nonwhite] students does not\n\ntransform [a] program into a quota.\"). Rather, the transfer policy\n\nconditioned on district demographics (+/- 10-15%) reflects the\n\ndefendants' efforts to obtain the benefits of diversity in a stable\n\nlearning environment.15 The Plan thus provides a sufficiently close\n\n\"fit\" to the defendants' compelling interest to ensure that \"'the\n\nmotive     for   the    classification     was       [not]    illegitimate   racial\n\nprejudice or stereotype.'\" Id. at 333 (quoting Croson, 488 U.S. at\n\n493 (plurality op.)).\n\n             The plaintiffs launch a second attack at the Plan's\n\ncalibration      on    the    grounds   that    it   is    inconsistent   with   the\n\ndefendants' statements that the benefits they seek maximize as a\n\nschool moves closer to 50% white/nonwhite.                   They point out that as\n\nof December 2004, Lynn's student population was more than 61.9%\n\n\n\n      15\n      This conclusion is bolstered by the testimony of Dr. Orfield,\na nationally recognized expert on school desegregation, who\nconcluded that the Plan \"used race no more than was necessary to\nallow Lynn to meet its educational goal of preparing students to\nlive in a multiracial society.\" Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at\n355.\n\n                                         -39-\n\fminority.    A middle school that is 50% minority (the proportion\n\nthat the defendants have described as ideal) would now fall outside\n\nof the +/- 10% range for racial balance and would instead be\n\nconsidered racially isolated, resulting in transfer limitations.\n\n            This argument misses the mark.   The Lynn Plan's goal is\n\nto improve the racial balance not of any particular school, but\n\nacross the school system as a whole.     The optimal balance for each\n\nschool might well be 50%, but Lynn's 61.9% minority population\n\nmeans that for every school closer to that ideal, another will be\n\nfurther away from it.        Evaluating schools by reference to the\n\nracial composition of the city's population is a sensible way for\n\nLynn to strive for the best racial balance attainable across its\n\nentire   school    system,    while   acknowledging   that   practical\n\nconstraints make it impossible for Lynn to have an equal population\n\nof minority and non-minority students in every individual school.\n\n            ii. White/nonwhite distinction\n\n            In addition to challenging the Plan's numerical ranges,\n\nthe plaintiffs also argue that the Plan is not narrowly tailored to\n\nadvance a compelling interest in racial diversity because it paints\n\nwith too broad a brush by distinguishing only between white and\n\nnonwhite students, thereby blurring the many subgroups within each\n\ncategory.    However, this white/nonwhite distinction reflects the\n\nreality of Lynn's experience.     As the district court found, before\n\nthe Plan, \"racial divisions and ethnic conflict between students\n\n\n                                  -40-\n\foccurred predominantly along a white/nonwhite axis.                 The growing\n\ngap in understanding between these groups burdened the schools in\n\nways that more precise shades of racial and ethnic difference did\n\nnot.\"    Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 379.          By increasing diversity\n\nalong the white/nonwhite axis, the Plan reduced racial tensions and\n\nproduced positive educational benefits.           Narrow tailoring does not\n\nrequire that Lynn ensure diversity among every racial and ethnic\n\nsubgroup as well.        See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 316 (noting that the\n\nLaw School sought to enroll a critical mass of \"minority\" students,\n\na category that included African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native\n\nAmericans).\n\n            iii. Duration\n\n            A narrowly tailored plan must be limited not only in\n\nscope, but also in time.           See id. at 342.         The Court held in\n\nGrutter that this durational requirement can be met by \"periodic\n\nreviews to determine whether racial preferences are still necessary\n\nto achieve student body diversity.\"             Id.    The Lynn Plan includes\n\nsuch     review.     The    PIC   continuously        monitors    the   schools'\n\ndemographics, gathering data on racial composition and transfers.\n\nUnder the Plan, transfer limits are suspended among schools that\n\nare racially balanced.       Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 377.              This\n\nfeature is not merely theoretical.               Students may now transfer\n\nfreely    among    all   three    Lynn   high   schools.         Lynn   has   also\n\nperiodically reevaluated the calibration of its Plan with an eye\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\ftoward maximizing the availability of transfers while maintaining\n\ndiverse schools.      Id. at 348 n.38 (noting that the Plan's original\n\n10% range was expanded to 15% for elementary schools to \"permit\n\nmore choice\" and that Lynn considered a 20% range in 1994 but\n\ndetermined that it would compromise student body diversity).                   We\n\nexpect that Lynn will continue to do so, presuming, as did the\n\nGrutter Court, that school officials will demonstrate a good faith\n\ncommitment     to     monitoring    the      continued     need   for      racial\n\nrestrictions.       See 539 U.S. at 343.\n\n             b. Consideration of race-neutral alternatives\n\n             Because narrow tailoring dictates that the government use\n\nrace only when necessary to achieve a compelling interest, it\n\nrequires \"serious,       good-faith    consideration      of   workable     race-\n\nneutral   alternatives      that   will      achieve     the   diversity     [the\n\ngovernment actor] seeks.\"          Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339; see also\n\nWygant, 476 U.S. at 280 n.6.        Here, the defendants have met their\n\nburden.   The record reflects that they seriously considered, and\n\nplausibly rejected, a number of race-neutral alternatives.                  These\n\nincluded (i) a no-transfer policy, see Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 387-88 (crediting evidence from a demographics expert that\n\ninstituting such a policy would throw several elementary schools\n\ninto racial imbalance); (ii) a policy of unrestricted transfers,\n\nsee id. at 388 (crediting evidence that instituting such a policy\n\nwould result in 500 to 800 segregative transfers per year); (iii)\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\fa redrawing of district lines, see id. at 387-88 (noting that this\n\nwould be impractical); (iv) forced busing, see id. at 387-88\n\n(concluding       that    the     problems   that     accompany      forced    busing\n\njustified Lynn's rejection of a controlled choice scheme); (v) a\n\nlottery system, see id. at 389 (finding that demographic and\n\nscheduling factors made this impracticable); and (vi) a plan\n\nconditioning transfers on socioeconomic status, rather than race,\n\nsee id. at 389 n.100 (noting that because of residential patterns,\n\nthis system would exacerbate existing racial imbalance).\n\n            The    plaintiffs       argue    that    there    are    several    other\n\nalternatives that the defendants failed to consider.                       They point\n\nspecifically       to    a   Department      of     Education      study    reviewing\n\nsuccessful race-neutral programs based on socioeconomic status or\n\na lottery, see U.S. Dep't of Educ., Achieving Diversity: Race-\n\nNeutral Alternatives in American Education (Feb. 2004), available\n\nat http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/raceneutral.html, and\n\nto the race-neutral student assignment plan adopted in Boston, see\n\nAnderson,   375     F.3d     at    76-77.      As    noted,     Lynn   has    already\n\nconsidered,    and       rejected,    the    possibility      of    basing    student\n\nassignments on socioeconomic status or a lottery. While the record\n\ndoes not reflect whether Lynn has considered the Boston plan in\n\ndepth, we note that the Boston plan is specific to the residential\n\npatterns in Boston, which differ from those in Lynn.                       Lynn must\n\nkeep abreast of possible alternatives as they develop, see Grutter,\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\f539 U.S. at 342-43, but it need not prove the impracticability of\n\nevery conceivable model for racial integration.                  It is sufficient\n\nthat it demonstrate a good faith effort to consider feasible race-\n\nneutral alternatives, as it has done here.             We therefore hold that\n\nthe Lynn Plan is narrowly tailored to the defendants' compelling\n\ninterest in obtaining the benefits of racial diversity.\n\nD. Related Federal Claims\n\n            The    plaintiffs     also    advance   several      statutory    equal\n\nprotection claims, contending that the Lynn Plan violates, inter\n\nalia, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983,16 and Title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct   of   1964,   42    U.S.C.    §     2000d.17    Our   resolution        of   the\n\nconstitutional equal protection challenge controls those claims.\n\nTitle VI \"'proscribe[s] only those racial classifications that\n\nwould violate the Equal Protection Clause.'\" Alexander v. Sandoval\n\n532 U.S. 275, 280-281 (2001) (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 287\n\n(Powell,   J.)).        Courts    have    also   treated   the    bar   on   racial\n\ndiscrimination imposed by § 1981 and § 1983 as coextensive with the\n\nprotections of the Equal Protection Clause. See Mescall v. Burrus,\n\n\n\n      16\n      42 U.S.C. § 1981 provides that \"[a]ll persons within the\njurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right . . .\nto the full and equal benefit of all laws.\"     42 U.S.C. § 1983\nprovides a cause of action based on the deprivation of\nconstitutional rights \"under color of any statute, ordinance,\nregulation, custom, or usage, of any State.\"\n      17\n       Title VI forbids racial discrimination \"under any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"      42 U.S.C. §\n2000d.\n\n                                         -44-\n\f603 F.2d 1266, 1271 (7th Cir. 1979) (\"The relationships of §§ 1981\n\nand 1983 to the Fourteenth Amendment are so close . . . that we\n\nbelieve the use of each section must be guided by the principles\n\nannounced by the Supreme Court for application of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment to discrimination cases.\"); see also Anderson, 375 F.3d\n\nat 77 n.7 (concluding that plaintiffs' claims under Title VI, §\n\n1981 and § 1983 \"turn on the resolution of the equal protection\n\nclaim\").    The district court was therefore correct in holding that\n\nthe plaintiffs are not entitled to federal statutory relief.\n\n                             IV. Article 111\n\n            Article 111 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights\n\nprovides    that   \"[n]o   student   shall   be   assigned    to   or   denied\n\nadmittance to a public school on the basis of race, color, national\n\norigin[,] or creed.\"        Plaintiffs contend that when a child is\n\nprevented from making a segregative transfer under the Lynn Plan,\n\nhe is illegally \"denied admittance to a public school on the basis\n\nof race.\"     Mass. Const. amend. art. 111.              The district court\n\nrejected this position as inconsistent with the meaning of Article\n\n111, which was designed to limit forced busing and to protect\n\nneighborhood schools.       Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 393.            The\n\ncourt also emphasized that although \"no court has ever expressly\n\ninterpreted Article 111, the SJC [i.e., the Massachusetts Supreme\n\nJudicial    Court]   has   consistently      construed    similarly     worded\n\nstatutes narrowly, holding that they do not categorically ban\n\n\n                                     -45-\n\fsuspect classifications but rather merely subject them to strict\n\nscrutiny.\"   Id.    Finally, the district court suggested that if\n\nArticle 111 were read broadly to prohibit any race-conscious\n\nstudent assignment plan, as the plaintiffs urge, it would likely\n\nrun afoul of the federal Constitution and other sections of the\n\nMassachusetts Declaration of Rights.   Id.   We review the district\n\ncourt's interpretation of the Article de novo.18     See Blockel v.\n\nJ.C. Penney Co., Inc., 337 F.3d 17, 29 (2003).\n\n           Although the SJC has not yet considered Article 111, it\n\nhas    identified   the   considerations     that   guide   judicial\n\ninterpretation of the state's constitution:\n\n           In determining the meaning of a constitutional\n      provision, we look to the language and structure of the\n      provision, so that it is construed so as to accomplish a\n      reasonable result and to achieve its dominating purpose.\n      We do so bearing in mind the Constitution was written to\n      be understood by the voters to whom it was submitted for\n      approval.   It is to be interpreted in the sense most\n      obvious to the common intelligence. Its phrases are to\n      be read and construed according to the familiar and\n      approved usage of the language.        The words of a\n      constitutional provision are to be given their natural\n      and obvious sense according to common and approved usage\n      at the time of its adoption.\n           Moreover, the Constitution is to be interpreted in\n      the light of the conditions under which it and its\n\n\n      18\n      The defendants assert that we should not consider the\nsubstance of the Article 111 claim at all, maintaining that the\nCommonwealth was a necessary party to adjudicate this claim but\ncould not be joined because of the Eleventh Amendment, see Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 19(b). Alternatively, they urge us to certify a question\nregarding the proper interpretation of Article 111 to the SJC\npursuant to Mass. R. Sup. Jud. Ct. 1:03.          We reject both\ncontentions, finding it appropriate to reach the merits as the\ndistrict court did.\n\n                               -46-\n\f       several parts were framed, the ends which it was designed\n       to accomplish, the benefits which it was expected to\n       confer, and the evils which it was hoped to remedy.\n\nMcDuffy v. Sec'y of the Executive Office of Educ., 615 N.E.2d 516,\n\n523 (Mass. 1993) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            To   determine   whether   Article   111   prohibits    a    race-\n\nconscious plan for voluntary student transfers, we begin, as the\n\nSJC has instructed, with the language of the provision.                 Id. at\n\n524. The plaintiffs contend that the plain language of the Article\n\nunequivocally invalidates the Lynn Plan.         They reason that when a\n\nstudent is precluded from transferring because of the transfer's\n\nimpact on racial balance, that student is \"denied admittance to a\n\npublic school on the basis of race\" within the meaning of Article\n\n111.\n\n            It is not readily apparent, however, that a student\n\ndenied a transfer is \"denied admittance\" to a school within the\n\nmeaning of the provision.        The Article's pairing of the terms\n\n\"assigned\" and \"denied admittance\" suggests that it contemplated\n\ninitial student placements, not subsequent transfers.              Under the\n\nLynn Plan, students are assigned to their neighborhood schools\n\nwithout regard to race; conversely, no student is denied that\n\nplacement based on race.     Only after a student has been assigned to\n\na school and wishes to transfer does race enter the calculus.\n\n            The \"specific circumstances of the adoption\" of Article\n\n111, see McDuffy, 615 N.E.2d at 528, convince us that the provision\n\n\n                                   -47-\n\fdoes not preclude such a plan.             Article 111 was adopted as an\n\namendment to the Massachusetts constitution in 1978. The House and\n\nSenate bills that became Article 111 were introduced by legislators\n\non behalf of Massachusetts Citizens Against Forced Busing.                   See\n\nComfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 395.           When the bill was presented to\n\nvoters for ratification, the constitutionally required description\n\nthat accompanied it19 explained:\n\n     A \"YES VOTE\" would guarantee the right of parents or\n     guardians of school-age children to educate those\n     children free from any arbitrary assignment by school\n     authorities to schools outside the school district. Any\n     public assignment to a school outside the school\n     district, based on achieving any established racial\n     quota-system or ethnic balance[,] would require the\n     permission of a parent or guardian.\n\nId. (citing Massachusetts Information for Voters (1978)); see also\n\nBates v. Dir. of Office of Campaign and Political Finance, 763\n\nN.E.2d    6,    22-23   (Mass.     2002)   (using    Information   for    Voters\n\nstatement as an aid to statutory construction).\n\n               We   would   be   hard-pressed   to   extrapolate   from    these\n\ncircumstances an intent that Article 111 bar an entirely voluntary\n\nstudent transfer program narrowly tailored to a compelling interest\n\nin the educational benefits of diversity.              As the district court\n\n\n\n     19\n      The Massachusetts Constitution requires the Secretary of\nState to publish and distribute information regarding ballot\nquestions, including the full text of every measure, \"a fair,\nconcise summary of the measure as such summary will appear on the\nballot [and] other information and arguments for and against the\nmeasure.\" Mass. Const. art. 48, Gen. Prov., pt. IV, as amended by\narts. 74 and 108.\n\n                                       -48-\n\fnoted, \"'the benefit [Article 111] was expected to confer' was\n\npreservation of neighborhood schools, and the 'evil which it was\n\nhoped to remedy' was the politically divisive resort to forced\n\nbusing.\"    Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp. at 395 (quoting McDuffy, 615\n\nN.E.2d at 523).     The Lynn Plan advances those goals.               It protects\n\nneighborhood school assignments and does not entail any forced non-\n\nneighborhood assignments.         Race-conscious transfers occur only if\n\ninitiated by a student's parent or guardian, a result entirely\n\nconsistent with the explanation of the Article put before the\n\nvoters.\n\n            The plaintiffs do not dispute that Article 111 was\n\ndesigned to prevent forced busing.                Rather, they argue that any\n\ninquiry into the Article's legislative history is improper because\n\nthe provision is clear on its face.           As we have already explained,\n\nthe   application    of   the     Article    to    the   context   of    voluntary\n\ntransfers is not entirely clear from the statutory language.\n\nMoreover,    the    SJC     has   expressly        provided    that     the   state\n\nconstitution's words \"must be given a construction adapted to carry\n\ninto effect its purpose.\"         Cohen v. Att'y Gen., 259 N.E.2d 539, 543\n\n(Mass. 1970) (quoting Tax Comm'r v. Putnam, 116 N.E. 904, 906\n\n(Mass.    1917)).     The    Article's      legislative       history    helps   us\n\ndetermine its purpose, and thereby points us to a construction that\n\nfurthers that purpose. Looking to legislative history is therefore\n\n\n\n\n                                      -49-\n\fentirely   consistent    with     the   principles   of    constitutional\n\ninterpretation set forth by the SJC.\n\n           Our conclusion that the Lynn Plan does not violate\n\nArticle 111 would be the same even if the Article did apply to a\n\nvoluntary transfer system.       As the district court recognized, the\n\nSJC has treated provisions similar to Article 111 not as banning\n\nthe use of race outright, but rather as subjecting the use of race\n\nto strict scrutiny.     Comfort IV, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 396; see also\n\nMcDuffy, 615 N.E.2d at 545 (noting that the court's decision on a\n\nmatter of first impression was consistent with earlier decisions).\n\n           In Attorney General v. Massachusetts Interscholastic\n\nAthletic Association, Inc., 393 N.E.2d 284 (Mass. 1979), the SJC\n\nconsidered a challenge, brought under the Massachusetts Equal\n\nRights Amendment (\"ERA\") and a state statute, to a rule prohibiting\n\nboys from joining girls' sports teams.           The ERA provides that\n\n\"[e]quality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because\n\nof sex, race, color, creed or national origin.\"           Mass. Const. pt.\n\n1, art. 1, as amended by art. 106.        The relevant statute provides:\n\n\"[n]o person shall be excluded from or discriminated against in\n\nadmission to a public school . . . or in obtaining the advantages,\n\nprivileges and courses of study of such public school on account of\n\nrace, color, sex, religion, national origin or sexual orientation.\"\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 76, § 5.      Although both of these provisions speak\n\nin absolute terms, the SJC did not treat them as automatically\n\n\n                                   -50-\n\finvalidating the gender-based prohibition at issue.              Rather, it\n\nsubjected the \"no boys on girls' teams\" rule to something akin to\n\nstrict scrutiny. 393 N.E.2d at 291-93. We have already determined\n\nthat the Lynn Plan survives the strict scrutiny required by the\n\nfederal Equal Protection Clause.        Therefore, it would also survive\n\nreview under Article 111, if the Article did apply in this context.\n\nEither way, the plaintiffs' claim fails.\n\n                               V. Recusal\n\n             Finally, the plaintiffs assert that the district court\n\njudge should have recused herself from this case.             Their argument\n\nis as follows: (1) prior to her appointment to the federal bench,\n\nJudge Gertner was a member of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil\n\nRights (\"LCCR\"), a nonprofit organization; (2) LCCR unsuccessfully\n\nmoved   to   intervene   in   this    litigation   on   the    side   of   the\n\ndefendants, and therefore (3) the law required that Judge Gertner\n\nrecuse herself.     Judge Gertner denied the recusal motion in an\n\norder dated March 21, 2002.          We review that ruling for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Camacho v. Autoridad de Telefonos, 868 F.2d 482, 490\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).\n\n             The controlling statute is 28 U.S.C. § 455, which sets\n\nforth the standards for recusal.            That statute provides that a\n\njudge \"shall\" recuse herself \"in any proceeding in which [her]\n\nimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\"           Id. § 455(a).       A\n\nparty who suggests that recusal is appropriate must support the\n\n\n                                     -51-\n\fmotion with facts that \"provide what an objective, knowledgeable\n\nmember of the public would find to be a reasonable basis for\n\ndoubting the judge's impartiality.\" In re Boston's Children First,\n\n244 F.3d 164, 167 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting In re United States, 666\n\nF.2d 690, 694 (1st Cir. 1981)).         The plaintiffs have failed to make\n\nthis showing.\n\n             Every   judge   comes    to    the   bench   with    a    lifetime   of\n\nbackground experiences, a roster of associations, and a myriad of\n\nviews.      This past history, in and of itself, is seldom sufficient\n\nto require recusal. Brody v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll.,\n\n664 F.2d 10, 11 (1st Cir. 1981) (per curiam).                  Unless there is a\n\ndirect link that establishes a reasonable basis for doubting\n\nimpartiality, the judge should not step aside.                        In re United\n\nStates, 158 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir. 1998); cf. United States v.\n\nGiorgi, 840 F.2d 1022, 1035 (1st Cir. 1988) (explaining that unless\n\na party can establish a reasonable factual basis to doubt a judge's\n\nimpartiality \"by some kind of probative evidence,\" then the \"judge\n\nmust hear a case as assigned\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n             These principles govern our decision here.                LCCR is not\n\na   party    to   this   case.       Even   if    it   were,     Judge   Gertner's\n\nrelationship with that organization ended when she took the bench\n\non February 14, 1994.            There is no allegation that she has\n\nmaintained ties with the LCCR.                Given the eight-year interval\n\nbetween the end of the judge's connection with LCCR and the recusal\n\n\n                                       -52-\n\fmotion, her prior association with that organization cannot be the\n\nbasis for a reasonable attack on her impartiality.                  Thus, recusal\n\nwas not obligatory.           See, e.g., Sierra Club v. Simkins Indus.,\n\nInc.,   847    F.2d   1109,    1117   (4th    Cir.    1988)     (holding    that   an\n\nassociation with a nonprofit organization that ended a decade\n\nbefore the proceedings commenced does not form a reasonable basis\n\nfor questioning the trial judge's impartiality, even though the\n\nnonprofit     organization      was   a   party      to   the   litigation);       cf.\n\nVeneklase v. City of Fargo, 236 F.3d 899, 901 (8th Cir. 2000)\n\n(finding recusal unnecessary where judge's former law firm had\n\nrepresented parties tangentially involved in civil rights suit);\n\nUnited States v. Story, 716 F.2d 1088, 1090 (6th Cir. 1983)\n\n(finding recusal unnecessary where judge had represented victim in\n\nwill contest matter thirteen years earlier).\n\n              The plaintiffs' argument that our decision in Boston's\n\nChildren      First   dictates    recusal      here       ignores   an     important\n\ndifference between the two cases.             In Boston's Children First, we\n\nordered recusal not because of the judge's past association with\n\ncivil rights organizations, but because the judge had publicly\n\ncommented on a pending case.          See 244 F.3d at 169-70.            The judge's\n\npassing comment in this case that LCCR was eligible to apply for\n\namicus status does not constitute a basis on which to require\n\nrecusal.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -53-\n\f            The plaintiffs' claim of bias is equally unpersuasive.\n\nThe only evidence of bias they cite involves their view of the\n\njudge's policy preferences.   That perception, standing alone, does\n\nnot warrant our interference with the district judge's recusal\n\ndecision.    If judges were subject to disqualification on such a\n\nbasis, our judicial system would be paralyzed.    See Camacho, 868\n\nF.2d at 491.    We therefore conclude that the court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in denying the motion for recusal.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n            - Concurring and Dissenting Opinions Follow -\n\n\n\n\n                                -54-\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge, concurring.    The Lynn plan at issue\n\nin this case is fundamentally different from almost anything that\n\nthe Supreme Court has previously addressed.    It is not, like old-\n\nfashioned racial discrimination laws, aimed at oppressing blacks,\n\ne.g., Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (1954); Strauder v. West\n\nVirginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1880); nor, like modern affirmative action,\n\ndoes it seek to give one racial group an edge over another (either\n\nto remedy past discrimination or for other purposes).         E.g.,\n\nAdarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995).         By\n\ncontrast to Johnson v. California, 125 S. Ct. 1141 (2005), the plan\n\ndoes not segregate persons by race.    See also Loving v. Virginia,\n\n388 U.S. 1 (1967).    Nor does it involve racial quotas.      E.g.,\n\nRegents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 273-79 (1978).\n\n          Instead, the plan uses race as an express criterion to\n\npermit transfers where they are consistent with maintaining schools\n\nwith a racial mix of students, and to limit transfers where they\n\nwould increase racial imbalance within the school system beyond\n\ncertain predetermined limits.   The plan does not purport to favor\n\none race over another, nor have the parties claimed that it does\n\nso.   Every child can as a matter of right attend his or her local\n\nschool.   And the parties have stipulated that Lynn's schools are\n\neducationally equal in quality; thus a child who is unable to\n\ntransfer to a non-local school of choice is not relegated to an\n\ninferior education.\n\n\n                                -55-\n\f          Whether such a plan is desirable as a matter of social\n\npolicy is open to reasonable debate.   So, too, are claims as to the\n\nextent of educational or civic benefits derived from the plan.\n\nBut, in the absence of a constitutional violation, these choices\n\nare customarily left to legislatures, city councils, school boards\n\nand voters.     Cf. Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 326 (1980).\n\nIndeed, one of the advantages of our federal regime is that\n\ndifferent communities try different solutions to common problems\n\nand gravitate toward those that prove most successful or seem to\n\nthem best to suit their individual needs.     See United States v.\n\nLopez, 514 U.S. 549, 581 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\n          Some may be offended by any express use of race as a\n\ntouchstone for transfers, believing that a race-based criterion is\n\nthe wrong lesson for school boards to teach and students to absorb.\n\nBut ours is a society with a heritage of racial problems growing\n\nout of generations of slavery and post-slavery segregation, and it\n\nmay be unrealistic to suppose that everything will work out well if\n\nonly race is ignored in every context.    In any event, the Supreme\n\nCourt has upheld the use of race-conscious solutions in certain\n\nsettings.20   The question is where and how one draws the line.\n\n          If we knew how the Supreme Court would decide the case\n\nbefore us, it would be right to adopt its answer in advance--\n\n\n     20\n      See, e.g., Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003);\nFullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448 (1980); Bakke, 438 U.S. 265;\ncf. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1 (1971).\n\n                                -56-\n\fwhatever this court's members might prefer.                       Cf. Wessmann v.\n\nGittens,    160    F.3d    790,     809-10    (1st    Cir.   1998)   (Boudin,   J.,\n\nconcurring).        But where the outcome in the Supreme Court is\n\nuncertain and past pronouncements were made in contexts different\n\nthan the one now presented, the appellate court must exercise its\n\nown   judgment     on     whether    the     local    plan   is   constitutionally\n\nforbidden.        There is very little to be said for mechanically\n\nextrapolating from general phrases visibly addressed to different\n\nissues.    United States v. Jerrold Elecs. Corp., 187 F. Supp. 545,\n\n555-56 (E.D. Pa. 1960), aff'd, 365 U.S. 567 (1961) (per curiam).\n\n            Treated as an open question, this is a difficult case.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s language disfavors racial tests and, without\n\nflatly forbidding them, has restricted their use with particular\n\nrubrics    (compelling      interest,        narrow   tailoring).      See,   e.g.,\n\nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 227.            But such rubrics depend on degree and\n\ncontext; there is no yardstick that crisply determines when an\n\ninterest is compelling enough or how narrow is sufficiently so.\n\nThe way the Lynn plan uses race is certainly more benign than laws\n\nthat favor or disfavor one race, segregate by race, or create\n\nquotas for or against a racial group.\n\n             The goal of the Lynn plan--to achieve the educational and\n\ncivic benefits of exposing youngsters to those of different races--\n\nis not unlawful; the attack is upon the means.                Yet given the goal,\n\nit is not easy to see how it can be achieved in a community like\n\n\n                                           -57-\n\fLynn without using race as a touchstone.        The problem is that in\n\nLynn, as in many other cities, minorities and whites often live in\n\ndifferent neighborhoods.     Lynn's aim is to preserve local schools\n\nas an option without having the housing pattern of de facto\n\nsegregation projected into the school system.             The choice is\n\nbetween openly using race as a criterion or concealing it through\n\nsome clumsier proxy device (e.g., transfer restrictions based upon\n\nfamily income).\n\n          If   the   plan   were   patently   offensive   to    core   equal\n\nprotection principles, this would be an easy case.             But the Lynn\n\nplan is far from the original evils at which the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment was addressed. The Fourteenth Amendment sought to forbid\n\nthe oppression of one race by another.        We are here working from\n\ndoctrines concerning the use of race-based criteria that are mainly\n\nthe product of twentieth-century jurisprudence. This is not a case\n\nin which, against the background of core principles, all doubts\n\nshould be resolved against constitutionality.\n\n          Rather, we are faced with a local experiment, pursuing\n\nplausible goals by novel means that are not squarely condemned by\n\npast Supreme Court precedent.        The problems that the Lynn plan\n\naddresses are real, and time is more likely than court hearings to\n\ntell us whether the solution is a good one; indeed, indications so\n\nfar are that Lynn's efforts have met with success.         To bring that\n\nsuccess to a halt in this court seems neither advisable nor\n\n\n                                   -58-\n\fnecessary.    The Supreme Court has not passed upon a plan anything\n\nlike the     one   before   us.   That    Court   is   free   to   extend   its\n\nprecedents to the present context, but that is its role--not ours.\n\nCf. State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 20 (1997).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -59-\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge (with whom HOWARD, Circuit Judge,\n\njoins), dissenting.        While no two cases are exactly alike, the\n\nfunction   of    the    judiciary    in   passing      upon    a   constitutional\n\nchallenge is to read the pertinent text of the Constitution,\n\nexamine the universe of relevant legal precedents, extract guiding\n\nprinciples from that case law, and apply those principles to the\n\nfacts at hand.         This case, like most cases, presents a factual\n\nscenario that contains certain idiosyncratic elements.                   There is\n\nneither a Supreme Court decision squarely addressing whether racial\n\ndiversity alone may constitute a compelling interest sufficient to\n\njustify    the   government's       race-conscious       preferences     nor    one\n\naddressing   the    narrow   tailoring       of    racial     classifications    in\n\nvoluntary, non-competitive school transfer plans.                    The majority\n\naccentuates those idiosyncracies, but chooses to overlook the\n\nelephant in the room:        the fact that this case arises against a\n\nbackdrop of Supreme Court jurisprudence, recently revisited in\n\nGrutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), and Gratz v. Bollinger,\n\n539 U.S. 244 (2003), that must guide our decision.\n\n           The     majority's   eagerness         to   justify     departing   from\n\nprecedent frees it to strike out on its own, fashioning a rule that\n\nflies in the teeth of the Supreme Court's stalwart opposition to\n\nthe use of inflexible, race-determinative methods in granting or\n\n\n\n\n                                      -60-\n\fdenying            benefits    to   citizens.21      Because    that    departure       is\n\ninconsistent with the role that an intermediate appellate court\n\nshould play in the federal system, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                   To my mind, the precedents are rather clear.                   The two\n\nlatest Supreme Court decisions illustrate the point.                         I begin by\n\nbriefly rehearsing the facts upon which those decisions turned.\n\n                   Gratz involved the University of Michigan's undergraduate\n\nadmissions program.                 The University automatically assigned 20\n\npoints — one-fifth of the 100 points needed to guarantee admission\n\n—   to        an   applicant    from    an   underrepresented      racial    or    ethnic\n\nminority group.               Gratz, 539 U.S. at 255.          This 20-point bonus\n\neffectively            made    race/ethnicity       determinative      for    minimally\n\nqualified minority applicants.                Id. at 272.\n\n                   Grutter involved law school admissions.             The law school\n\ntook      race       into     account   as   one    of   several   variables       in   an\n\nindividual's application.               Grutter, 539 U.S. at 340.            The school\n\nassigned no mechanical score based on an applicant's race; instead,\n\nit considered race only as one of several possible ways in which an\n\napplicant could enrich the diversity of the student body.                          Id. at\n\n315-16.            Moreover, the school set no quotas for racial or ethnic\n\nminorities.           Id. at 335-36.\n\n\n\n         21\n      While such methods may be justified to remedy the effects of\npast discrimination, see, e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd.\nof Ed., 402 U.S. 1 (1971), no such justification exists in this\ncase.\n\n                                             -61-\n\f             The Supreme Court struck down the plan used in Gratz\n\nwhile upholding the one used in Grutter.                In arriving at these\n\ndecisions, the Court made it crystal clear that a race-conscious\n\nadmissions program must use race in \"a flexible, non-mechanical\n\nway\" if it is to be considered narrowly tailored (and, thus, if it\n\nis to pass constitutional muster).            Id. at 334.    Such a plan cannot\n\ninstitutionalize a quota system or in any way insulate one category\n\nof applicants from another solely on account of race.                    See id.;\n\nGratz, 539 U.S. at 258, 270-72.          Race can, however, be used as a\n\nplus factor in the course of individualized consideration of each\n\napplicant.      Grutter, 539 U.S. at 334.\n\n             The majority, emphasizing that context matters, simply\n\nwrites this requirement out of the narrow-tailoring analysis.\n\nThat, to me, requires more than a soupcon of legal legerdemain.\n\nWhile    I   agree    that   context   matters,       the   Supreme    Court     has\n\ncatalogued a compendium of dangers flowing from the mechanical,\n\ninflexible, and exclusive use of race as a determinant.                   For one\n\nthing,   such    an    approach   insulates     the    preferred      category    of\n\napplicants from competition with other applicants.                 Grutter, 539\n\nU.S. at 334.          For another thing, such an approach feeds the\n\nstereotype that students from the preferred group lack academic\n\nmerit and, thus, raises the specter of stigmatic harm. See Regents\n\nof Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 298 (1978) (opinion of\n\nPowell, J.) (stating that \"preferential programs may only reinforce\n\n\n                                       -62-\n\fcommon stereotypes holding that certain groups are unable to\n\nachieve success without special protection\").\n\n              The majority argues that these dangers are less ominous\n\nin a setting, like this one, that neither skews a competitive\n\nprocess nor substitutes race as a proxy for academic merit.                   But\n\ncompetitive disadvantage and the substitution of race for academic\n\nmerit   are    not   the   only    reasons      behind    the   Supreme   Court's\n\nunderstandable disdain for quotas and other inflexible uses of\n\nracial determinants.        Regardless of the burden imposed by a racial\n\npreference, the simple act of granting benefits based on a quota or\n\nother mechanical use of race will breed cross-racial tension.                  See\n\nRichmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality\n\nop.).    Moreover, when government indulges in the automatic and\n\nunflinching use of race in the bestowal of any benefit, that usage\n\ncounteracts the ultimate goal of relegating racial distinctions to\n\nirrelevance.      Id. at 495.      As the Court reminded us earlier this\n\nyear,   the    mechanical    use   of    racial     classifications       inflicts\n\nstigmatic harm wherever and whenever it occurs — a consequence that\n\nis by no means limited to contexts that involve schools, students,\n\nor academic merit.         See Johnson v. California, 125 S. Ct. 1141,\n\n1147    (2005)    (explaining      in    a     prison    context   that   \"racial\n\nclassifications threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of\n\ntheir membership in a racial group\" and \"perpetuate the notion that\n\nrace matters most\").\n\n\n                                        -63-\n\f            Nothing in either Grutter or Gratz (or in any other case,\n\nfor that matter) dispels the notion that mechanical, race-based\n\nprograms work this harm — and, indeed, the Lynn Plan inflicts it\n\nupon a number of students seeking to benefit from a program that\n\nLynn knows is appealing without regard to racial reasons.                      To\n\nillustrate,    consider    that    the   Plan   can   succeed      only   if   the\n\nopportunity to transfer to a distant school is attractive to\n\nparents.     It is conceivable that some parents would transfer a\n\nchild out of a desire to have the child learn in a more integrated\n\nenvironment. But the Lynn Plan actively creates and exploits other\n\nmethods of benign coercion in search of its goal.               For instance,\n\nLynn admits that a major function of its \"theme\" schools is to\n\nentice parents to transfer their children.                  Another method is\n\nselling convenience to parents.          School officials are aware that\n\nsome of schools are located near after-school programs or near\n\nhigh-employment areas.          Every student, of every race, in every\n\nschool     zone,   has   some   potential   benefit     —    yet    the   school\n\ncommittee's policy evaluates whether students may take part in the\n\ntransfer program based solely on the color of a student's skin.\n\nOnly after experiencing a racially based rejection can an affected\n\nstudent plead for relief from the stated policy.\n\n             In one sense, then, this plan is even more harmful than\n\nthe racially inflexible program struck down in Gratz.                     There,\n\nprospective non-minority students could be admitted by the terms of\n\n\n                                     -64-\n\fthe policy itself and thus those who were rejected could look to\n\nsomething other than race as a reason for their failure.\n\n          The majority writes off these concerns, stating that\n\nLynn's goal is increased racial harmony for the student body as a\n\nwhole.    But the end cannot be allowed to justify the use of\n\nunconstitutional means; even laudable goals must be attained in\n\nconstitutional ways.      The Lynn Plan's inflexible use of race\n\noffends this principle.\n\n          Moreover, the majority's attempted justification misses\n\na crucial point.    The Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals,\n\nnot groups.   Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227\n\n(1995). There is a harm inflicted on a student when her government\n\ndenies her transfer for the sole or determinative reason of race —\n\nan immutable condition that she cannot change. That harm cannot be\n\nignored simply because it serves what others (be they school\n\ncommittee members or my distinguished colleagues) perceive as a\n\ngreater good.      Cf. Grutter, U.S. at 341 (holding that narrow\n\ntailoring requires program to not unduly harm members of any racial\n\ngroup).\n\n          If more were needed — and I doubt that it is — the\n\nmechanical use of race is not necessary to meet the compelling\n\ninterests that Lynn asserts here.      A flexible, race-conscious\n\ntransfer program, creating a strong but non-determinative \"plus\"\n\nfactor for integrative transfers but permitting other transfers\n\n\n                                -65-\n\fbased on the strength of individual requests, would serve to\n\nincrease diversity and avoid the harm arising from an unflinching\n\nuse of race.        The children rejected for transfer under such a plan\n\nwould not be rejected solely because of the color of their skin but\n\nbecause    the      reasons   supporting      their    transfer      requests       were\n\ncomparatively         insubstantial.          That     kind    of    harm      is    not\n\nconstitutionally suspect.\n\n               Lynn hardly can be heard to complain that such a plan is\n\nunworkable. By its own admission, it already allows more than half\n\nof the students denied transfers under its race-based policy to\n\nhave an exemption for non-race-related reasons.                     These transfers\n\nhave not       undermined     the   benefits     of   diversity     in   the    school\n\ncommunity.          The city persists, however, in subjecting all the\n\nstudents who request transfers to what is in effect a two-tier\n\nprocess — one in which the student is evaluated solely on the basis\n\nof color and a second in which a rejected student must convince the\n\nschool that his or her color should not matter.\n\n               Many good things can be said about the Lynn Plan.                    I do\n\nnot doubt that it is well-intentioned and that it has helped to\n\npromote    greater      diversity     in   the    public      schools.      But      the\n\noverriding fact is that it unnecessarily inflicts racially based\n\nwounds    on    a    large    and   diverse    group    of    its    students       and,\n\nconsequently, fails to satisfy the narrow-tailoring requirement set\n\nout in the Supreme Court's equal protection jurisprudence. Because\n\n\n                                       -66-\n\fthat is so, I must respectfully dissent from what I view to be an\n\nerroneous decision.\n\n\n\n\n                              -67-\n\f",

This appeal requires us to review\n\ncertain features of a voluntary plan designed to achieve the\n\neducational benefits of racial diversity in the public schools of\n\nLynn, Massachusetts (\"Lynn Plan\" or \"Plan\").                The Plan addresses\n\nresource allocation, curricula, and other aspects of the classroom\n\nexperience.    Relevant to this appeal, it also controls school\n\nassignments   and   transfers.        Under    the   Plan,    each    student    is\n\nentitled to attend his or her neighborhood school. Students who do\n\nnot wish to attend their neighborhood school may apply to transfer\n\nto another school.    Approval of a transfer depends, in large part,\n\non the requesting student's race and the racial makeup of the\n\ntransferor and transferee schools.\n\n           Parents whose children were denied transfers on race-\n\nconscious grounds challenged the transfer provisions of the Lynn\n\nPlan,   claiming,   inter    alia,    that    the    provisions      violate    the\n\nFourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause.               The district court\n\nrejected the parents' challenges and upheld the Plan.                 A panel of\n\nthis court    reversed,     finding   that     the   Plan    was   not   narrowly\n\ntailored to the defendants' compelling interest in achieving the\n\nbenefits of educational diversity.            We granted review en banc and\n\nnow affirm.\n\n           Our review of the equal protection challenge is informed\n\nby the Supreme Court's recent decisions regarding affirmative\n\naction in higher education, Grutter v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f(2003), and Gratz v.

We conclude,\n\nbased on those cases, that Lynn has a compelling interest in\n\nsecuring the educational benefits of racial diversity.                  Applying\n\nthe analytic framework set forth in Grutter and Gratz to the\n\ncontext of a K-12, non-competitive transfer plan, we hold that the\n\nLynn Plan is narrowly tailored to meet this compelling interest.\n\n            The plaintiffs assert a number of other claims as well.\n\nWe do not reach the merits of their facial challenge to the\n\nMassachusetts     Racial   Imbalance    Act,   which      fails   for   lack   of\n\nstanding.    We treat the plaintiffs' federal statutory claims as\n\nforeclosed   by    our   equal    protection     ruling    and    reject   their\n\nchallenge to the Plan under Article 111 of the Massachusetts\n\nDeclaration of Rights.       Finally, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt properly denied the plaintiffs' motion for recusal.\n\n                                 I.

We set forth only\n\nthose facts necessary to put this case into context, drawing upon\n\nthe largely unchallenged findings of the district court.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fA. Lynn Public Schools\n\n          Lynn is the ninth-largest city in Massachusetts, with a\n\npopulation of approximately 89,000.           At all relevant times, its\n\nschool system has been neighborhood-centered, entitling students to\n\nattend their local schools as a matter of right.         By the mid-1970s,\n\nseveral of Lynn's schools were experiencing significant racial\n\nimbalance.      In   1977,   for   example,    the   Washington   Community\n\nElementary School had a nonwhite student population of 57%, more\n\nthan six times the nonwhite percentage in the school system as a\n\nwhole. Predominantly nonwhite schools suffered disproportionately\n\nfrom resource shortages, overcrowding, discipline problems, and\n\nteacher apathy.      The school system was plagued by high absentee\n\nrates, racial tension, and low test scores.\n\n             In an effort to combat these problems, Lynn established\n\nits first magnet school in 1979.       At the same time, it inaugurated\n\na voluntary transfer program aimed at attracting white students to\n\nthat school (which apparently was located in a predominantly\n\nnonwhite area of the city).        The magnet school was only modestly\n\nsuccessful in alleviating racial imbalance.\n\n             In the meantime, Lynn was undergoing a demographic shift.\n\nBetween 1980 and 2000, the city went from being 93% white to 63%\n\nwhite, with the school-age population becoming more than half\n\nnonwhite by 2000. Residential segregation by race increased during\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthis period as whites clustered in the northern and western areas\n\nof Lynn and nonwhites concentrated in its south-central region.\n\n             Because   of   the     neighborhood   school   system,   these\n\nresidential patterns heightened the racial imbalance of Lynn's\n\nschools.     By 1987, seven of eighteen elementary schools had white\n\nenrollments of 90% or more, while four others had predominantly\n\nnonwhite student bodies.          Lynn responded by developing a plan to\n\nlaunch ten magnet schools,1 but city leaders did not believe that\n\nthe magnet program, on its own, would effectively combat the\n\ngrowing racial imbalance.           In September 1989, the Lynn School\n\nCommittee (\"Lynn\") adopted the Plan that is the subject of this\n\nlitigation.2\n\nB. The Lynn Plan\n\n             The defendants describe the Lynn Plan as a voluntary plan\n\nfor school improvement and the elimination of minority isolation.\n\nThe Plan begins with the premise that every child is entitled to\n\nattend his or her neighborhood school.        Race is taken into account\n\n\n     1\n      Ordinarily, the label \"magnet school\" describes an elite\npublic school with a competitive admissions policy. Lynn's magnet\nschools, however, do not use a competitive admissions policy.\nRather, Lynn uses the term for schools that feature an educational\ntheme beyond the standard curriculum, designed partially to attract\ncross-neighborhood transfers.    Examples of such themes include\n\"Life Science\" and \"Reading and Writing Literary and Whole\nLanguage.\" Despite this specialization the parties have stipulated\nthat \"the education provided . . . in each of the elementary,\nmiddle, and high schools in Lynn is comparable in quality,\nresources[,] and curriculum.\"\n     2\n         The Plan was amended in 1990 and again in 1999.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fonly when a student seeks to transfer to a school other than his or\n\nher neighborhood school.\n\n           Lynn operates eighteen elementary schools (six of which\n\nare magnets), four middle schools (three of which have magnet\n\nprograms), and three high schools.3    In the 2001-02 school year,\n\n15,444 students were enrolled in the Lynn public schools.   Out of\n\nthis group, approximately 42% of students were white, 15% African-\n\nAmerican, 29% Hispanic, and 14% Asian (for a total \"minority\" or\n\nnonwhite population of roughly 58%).\n\n           For purposes of the Lynn Plan, schools are placed in one\n\nof three categories.   A \"racially balanced\" school is one in which\n\nthe percentage of nonwhite students falls within a set range of the\n\noverall proportion of minorities in Lynn's student population. The\n\nrange is +/- 15% for elementary schools and +/- 10% for other\n\nschools.   For example, an elementary school with between 43% and\n\n73% nonwhite students during the 2001-02 school year was considered\n\nracially balanced, as was a middle or high school that had a\n\nnonwhite enrollment of 48% to 68%.     In the 2001-02 school year,\n\nnine of Lynn's elementary schools, one of its middle schools, and\n\nall three of its high schools were racially balanced.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Lynn also operates six alternative schools, offering such\nthings as special needs education and vocational training. These\nschools are not subject to the transfer provisions of the Lynn\nPlan.\n\n                                -7-\n\f             If     a    school's       nonwhite        population    falls    below     the\n\nracially balanced range (i.e., if the percentage of nonwhite\n\nstudents in 2001-02 fell below 43% for an elementary school or 48%\n\nfor   a   middle        or    high     school),      it     is    \"racially    isolated.\"\n\nConversely, a school whose nonwhite population rises above the\n\nracially balanced range (i.e., over 73% for an elementary school or\n\n68%   for    a    middle         or   high    school)       is    considered       \"racially\n\nimbalanced.\" In 2001-02, five of Lynn's elementary schools and one\n\nof its middle schools were classified as racially isolated, while\n\nfour elementary schools and two middle schools were racially\n\nimbalanced.\n\n             The        transfer       policy       is     straightforward.             Space\n\npermitting,       a     student       whose   neighborhood         school     is    racially\n\nbalanced may transfer to another racially balanced school without\n\nregard to race.              Because all three of Lynn's high schools are\n\ncurrently racially balanced, for example, students may transfer\n\nfreely      among       them.         Students      are    also    permitted       to    make\n\n\"desegregative\" transfers.                That is, a white student may transfer\n\nout of a racially isolated school and into a racially imbalanced\n\nschool    (i.e.,        to   a   school      with   a     lower   percentage       of   white\n\nstudents), and a nonwhite student may transfer out of a racially\n\nimbalanced school and into a racially isolated school (i.e., to a\n\nschool with a lower percentage of nonwhite students). By contrast,\n\nabsent certain exceptions, students may not make \"segregative\"\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\ftransfers.     A segregative transfer is one that would exacerbate\n\nracial imbalance in the sending or receiving school (i.e., a white\n\nstudent may not transfer to a racially isolated school, and a\n\nnonwhite    student   may   not   transfer    to   a   racially   imbalanced\n\nschool).4\n\n             A student whose transfer request is denied is entitled to\n\nappeal.     Roughly half of all appeals are granted.        Common grounds\n\nfor successful appeals are medical and safety concerns, daycare\n\nissues, and other types of hardship.         Appeals will also be granted\n\nwhen the denial would result in siblings attending different\n\nschools.    The Plan is implemented by the Parent Information Center\n\n(\"PIC\"), which processes all admissions and transfers, works with\n\nparents on appeals, and monitors enrollment and racial composition\n\nof individual schools and the district in general.\n\n             As the plaintiffs point out, the Lynn Plan can result in\n\nunequal treatment based on race.             Consider, for example, two\n\nchildren, one white and one African-American, who are initially\n\nassigned to the same neighborhood elementary school for the 2001-02\n\nschool year.    The school is racially isolated (i.e., less than 43%\n\nminority).     Both children request a transfer to a nearby school\n\nthat is racially imbalanced (i.e., greater than 73% minority).\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Any student who qualifies as \"multi-racial\" is not subject to\nthe race-conscious transfer limits.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fUnder the Plan, the white student will be permitted to transfer,\n\nand the African-American student will not.\n\n             Although the race-conscious transfer policy is the focus\n\nof    this   appeal,     the   Lynn    Plan    also   includes   numerous       other\n\nprovisions aimed at improving the quality of all schools in the\n\ndistrict.     It calls for curricular programs and teacher training\n\ndesigned to foster cross-racial understanding and reduce racial\n\ntension.     It also implemented a standardized curriculum throughout\n\nLynn's schools;         developed     performance     indicators      for   schools,\n\nprograms and students; took measures to improve student attendance;\n\nand created business/college partnerships with schools to improve\n\nthe    quality     of   instruction.      Finally,       the   Plan    envisions    a\n\nconstruction program to upgrade school facilities and alleviate\n\novercrowding.\n\n             All    parties    agree    that    Lynn's    public      schools    have\n\nimproved markedly since the Plan's inception, although they dispute\n\nwhich aspects of the Plan are responsible for this improvement. In\n\nany event, students' standardized test scores have increased,\n\nabsentee levels have decreased, and racial tensions have diminished\n\nunder the Plan.\n\nC. The Racial Imbalance Act\n\n             The Racial Imbalance Act (\"RIA\"), Mass. Gen.

The legislature enacted\n\nthe RIA in response to findings that dramatic levels of racial\n\nimbalance in the public schools threatened to harm students'\n\neducational opportunities.    See id. at 733-34.       The RIA has two\n\nmain effects: it authorizes the Board to fund voluntary efforts to\n\nimprove racial balance, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 15, § 1I, and it allows\n\nthe Board to require that school districts adopt integration plans\n\nin certain circumstances, id. ch. 71, § 37D.\n\n           The Lynn school system has received significant state aid\n\nunder the voluntary provisions of the RIA. These funds have helped\n\npay for new construction and school renovations.5             Lynn also\n\nreceives a state stipend of $500 for each desegregative student\n\ntransfer, and the state defrays certain costs associated with\n\ncross-neighborhood   transportation    and   the   creation   of   magnet\n\nschools.\n\nD. Procedural History\n\n           In 1999, the parents of children who had been denied\n\ntransfers under the Lynn Plan (\"Comfort plaintiffs\") brought a\n\ncivil action against the Lynn School Committee, its individual\n\nmembers, and several governmental officials. They claimed that the\n\n\n     5\n      Before 2001, the RIA provided reimbursement for school\nconstruction and renovations undertaken for the purpose of reducing\nracial imbalance. The law has been amended to change this funding\nstructure, but that amendment applies prospectively and does not\naffect Lynn's state funding.\n\n                                -11-\n\fLynn Plan and the RIA violate the Fourteenth Amendment Equal\n\nProtection Clause, several federal civil rights statutes, and\n\nArticle 111 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.                           The\n\nCommonwealth intervened as a party defendant for the limited\n\npurpose of defending the RIA.               See 28 U.S.C. § 2403(b).              The\n\ndistrict court denied a motion to preliminarily enjoin the race-\n\nconscious aspects of the Lynn Plan, see Comfort I, 100 F.

The Bollen\n\nplaintiffs also added as defendants the members of the Board of\n\nEducation    in    their   official       capacities.

Thus, we begin by considering the plaintiffs' standing.\n\n           To establish standing in federal court, a party must\n\ndemonstrate three things:\n\n     First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in\n     fact\" -- an invasion of a legally protected interest\n     which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual\n     or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. Second,\n     there must be a causal connection between the injury and\n     the conduct complained of -- the injury has to be fairly\n     traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and\n     not the result of the independent action of some third\n     party not before the court.

Plaintiffs describe their injury\n\nas both a racially-based denial of transfers and the stigma of\n\ntheir inability to \"compete\" on equal terms for transfers.              Even\n\n\n\n      7\n      Nor have the plaintiffs shown that they are               under   any\nimminent threat of being subjected to these mandates.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fassuming arguendo that this asserted injury is somehow traceable to\n\nthe RIA, the plaintiffs cannot show that an injunction against the\n\nRIA's incentive provisions will lead to racially unrestricted\n\ntransfers within the Lynn public schools or eliminate the perceived\n\nstigmatic harm.\n\n           This point is apparent from the record.   Under the terms\n\nof the RIA, Lynn has received state funding for construction and\n\nbusing based on its voluntary efforts to combat racial imbalance.\n\nEven if we directed the Board to distribute aid without regard to\n\nracial balancing efforts, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that\n\nredress would likely follow.    There is no reason to believe that\n\nLynn would cancel its transfer program merely because state funding\n\nwas no longer contingent on it.\n\n           In an effort to sustain their claim, the plaintiffs and\n\namicus Pacific Legal Foundation also present a second theory for\n\nprospective relief.   They assert that the incentive provisions of\n\nthe RIA are effectively mandatory because they coerce school\n\ndistricts to adopt race-conscious plans by tying state aid to the\n\nadoption of those plans.   There is a flaw in this argument.   While\n\nthe RIA's incentive provisions reward schools that address racial\n\nimbalance, they do not dictate a procedure or methodology by which\n\nschools must do so.   See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 15, § 1I; id. ch. 71,\n\n§ 37C.   Given the absence of a requirement that schools adopt race-\n\nconscious plans to comply with the RIA, the plaintiffs have not\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fshown that       the   incentive   provisions    of    the    RIA   are   causally\n\nresponsible for the voluntary adoption of race-conscious transfer\n\npolicies.\n\n            Even if the plaintiffs did have standing to mount a\n\nfacial challenge to the voluntary provisions of the RIA, we agree\n\nwith the district court that such a challenge would fail.

This rule applies\n\nin the present context just as firmly.                   The Plan must be reviewed\n\nunder strict scrutiny.\n\n              This standard is not \"strict in theory, but fatal in\n\nfact.\"      Id.    at    1151;      see   also    Grutter,       539    U.S.   at   326-27\n\n(\"Although all governmental uses of race are subject to strict\n\nscrutiny, not all are invalidated by it.\").

We therefore bear in mind the\n\n                                           -20-\n\fcourt's admonition that \"[c]ontext matters when reviewing race-\n\nbased governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.\"                 Id.\n\nB. Compelling State Interest\n\n            Until recently, there was some question as to whether\n\ndiversity could constitute a compelling interest in the educational\n\ncontext.    See Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 795-96.         The Supreme Court has\n\nnow answered that question in the affirmative, holding in Grutter\n\nthat a law school's interest in obtaining the educational benefits\n\nthat flow from a diverse student body was compelling enough to\n\njustify the narrowly tailored use of race in admissions.              539 U.S.\n\nat 343.\n\n            Grutter   involved     a    challenge    to   the    University   of\n\nMichigan Law School's admissions policy, which took into account\n\nracial and ethnic background as one of several \"soft variables\"\n\nused in assessing applicants.             Id. at 315.           The Law School\n\njustified this strategy as furthering its goal of assembling a\n\nclass that was both \"exceptionally . . . qualified and broadly\n\ndiverse.\"    Id. at 329.      It also sought to enroll a \"critical mass\"\n\nof   minority    students,    thereby    enhancing    its   quest    for   broad\n\ndiversity.      Id. at 330.\n\n            The Grutter Court stressed that the Law School's plan did\n\nnot pursue a critical mass of minority students for its own sake,\n\nbut rather for the sake of obtaining the educational benefits that\n\nflow from having a racially diverse student body.                Id. at 329-30\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\f(acknowledging        that    racial     balancing       for   its    own     sake    is\n\nunconstitutional).           These educational benefits include promoting\n\ncross-racial understanding, breaking down stereotypes, fostering\n\nlivelier and better informed class discussions, and preparing\n\nstudents to succeed in an increasingly diverse society.                        Id. at\n\n330.     The Court largely deferred to the Law School's educational\n\njudgment not only in determining that diversity would produce these\n\nbenefits, but also in determining that these benefits were critical\n\nto the school's educational mission.                 Id. at 328-33.         The Court\n\nwarned, however, that \"scrutiny of the interest asserted by the Law\n\nSchool    is    no    less    strict    for     taking    into      account    complex\n\neducational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the\n\nexpertise of the university.\" Id. at 328. Nevertheless, the Court\n\nconcluded      that    the    pursuit    of    these     benefits     constituted      a\n\ncompelling state interest.             Id.    In so ruling, it recognized \"the\n\noverriding importance of [education in] preparing students for work\n\nand citizenship.\"        Id. at 331.\n\n               Against this background, we consider the interest that\n\nLynn's race-conscious Plan seeks to advance.                   This is not a case\n\nwhere    the    racial    classification        is     aimed   at    remedying       past\n\nsegregation.          See Comfort IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 390 n.101.\n\nRather, the parties stipulated that Lynn's interests\n\n       include fostering integrated public schools and what Lynn\n       believes are [their] positive effects; reducing minority\n       isolation and avoiding segregation and what Lynn believes\n       are their negative effects; promoting a positive racial\n\n                                         -22-\n\f      climate at schools and a safe and healthy school\n      environment; fostering a cohesive and tolerant community\n      in Lynn; promoting diversity; ensuring equal education\n      and life opportunities and increasing the quality of\n      education for all students.\n\n           The district court grouped these interests into two\n\ncategories: (i) reaping the educational benefits that flow from\n\nhaving a racially diverse student body in each of Lynn's public\n\nschools, and (ii) avoiding the negative educational consequences\n\nthat accompany racial isolation.\n\n           Although   there    are    some    differences     between   these\n\ninterests, we conclude that they are essentially two sides of the\n\nsame coin. The negative consequences of racial isolation that Lynn\n\nseeks to avoid and the benefits of diversity that it hopes to\n\nachieve are rooted in the same central idea: that all students are\n\nbetter off in racially diverse schools.            We therefore restate the\n\ninterests at stake here as obtaining the educational benefits of a\n\nracially diverse student body.\n\n           Lynn maintains that ensuring a racially diverse student\n\nbody in its schools has produced, and will continue to produce,\n\nmany of the same benefits cited by the Grutter Court: disarming\n\nracial stereotypes, increasing racial tolerance, and preparing\n\nstudents to live and work in an increasingly multi-racial society.\n\nThe   defendants'   expert    evidence      also   suggests   that   racially\n\nisolated students often feel psychological burdens that can lead to\n\npoor attendance and academic woes, and that these effects can be\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fcombated by racial integration.           Consistent with these assertions,\n\nLynn's schools have indeed experienced many positive developments\n\n-- including higher attendance rates, declining suspension rates,\n\na safer environment, and improved standardized test scores -- since\n\nthe Plan's inception.\n\n               In Lynn's view, these developments can be explained by\n\nthe intergroup contact theory.                This theory holds that \"under\n\ncertain conditions, interaction between students of different races\n\npromotes empathy, understanding, positive racial attitudes[,] and\n\nthe disarming of stereotypes.\"           Comfort IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 356.\n\nUnder    the     intergroup    contact       theory,      there       are   four    basic\n\nconditions for success: (1) equal status among racial groups, (2)\n\nthe     presence    of     teachers    and     staff      trained      to    facilitate\n\ninteractions between members of different groups, (3) common goals\n\nand cooperative activities, and (4) opportunities for personalized\n\ncontact with a sufficient number of children from different racial\n\ngroups to disrupt stereotypes.            Id. at 356-57.\n\n               Lynn's    experts    explained      that    meaningful        intergroup\n\ncontact    (the    fourth     condition       of   intergroup         contact      theory)\n\nrequires that a school have a \"critical mass\" of students of each\n\ngroup, i.e., white and nonwhite.              Id. at 357.       Lynn's experts also\n\ntestified, and the district court found, that the benefits of\n\nintergroup       contact    continue     to    accrue      as     a    school      becomes\n\nincreasingly diverse.         Id.     Citing this theory and crediting the\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\fdefense experts who explained its application in Lynn, the district\n\ncourt agreed that there was a causal link between improvements in\n\nthe school system and increased racial diversity.              Id. at 353-54.\n\n           While acknowledging improvements in the Lynn schools\n\nsince the Plan's inception, the plaintiffs disagree that these\n\nchanges can be attributed to the race-conscious aspect of the Lynn\n\nPlan.    More significantly, they also contend that regardless of\n\nwhether there are educational benefits to racial diversity, Lynn\n\ndoes not have a compelling interest in achieving those benefits.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n           Lynn's transfer policy expressly aims at attaining racial\n\ndiversity in the city's schools.          Where a community does not seek\n\nracial   diversity   for   its   own    sake,   but   rather   to   advance   a\n\ncompelling interest in the educational benefits that diversity\n\nprovides, there is no absolute bar to pursuing racial diversity.\n\nSee Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330.          The district court found that this\n\nwas Lynn's purpose, Comfort IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 375-76, and the\n\nrecord supports that finding. We see no reason to second-guess it.\n\nCf. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 328 (stating that, typically, a school's\n\n\"educational judgment that . . . diversity is essential to                its\n\neducational mission is one to which we defer\").\n\n           The plaintiffs assert that, unlike Grutter, this case\n\ndoes not implicate a compelling interest that would justify the\n\npursuit of racial diversity.           The admissions plan at issue in\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fGrutter strove for diversity along many axes, including race, in an\n\neffort to create a student body with diverse viewpoints, thereby\n\nenriching classroom discussion and academic experiences.   See 539\n\nU.S. at 329 (\"As part of its goal of assembling a class that is\n\n. . . broadly diverse, the Law School seeks to enroll a critical\n\nmass of minority students.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that Grutter's recognition of a compelling\n\ninterest in \"the educational benefits that flow from student body\n\ndiversity,\"   539 U.S. at 330, is thus limited to the benefits that\n\nflow from viewpoint diversity in the higher education context and\n\ndoes not extend to the benefits that flow from racial diversity in\n\nthe K-12 context.\n\n          Again, we disagree.    Lynn's asserted interests bear a\n\nstrong familial resemblance to those that the Grutter Court found\n\ncompelling. There is no reason to believe that these interests are\n\nadvanced by viewpoint diversity but not racial diversity, or that\n\nthey are substantially stronger in the context of higher education\n\nthan in the context of elementary and secondary education.

But Grutter teaches that the compelling state interest in\n\ndiversity should be judged in relation to the educational benefits\n\nthat it seeks to produce.     539 U.S. at 330.    The Lynn Plan uses\n\nrace in pursuit of many of the same benefits that were cited\n\napprovingly by the Grutter Court, including breaking down racial\n\nbarriers,   promoting   cross-racial   understanding,   and   preparing\n\nstudents for a world in which \"race unfortunately still matters.\"\n\nId. at 333.8    There are, of course, some variances between the\n\nbenefits sought.    For example, the law school plan at issue in\n\nGrutter focused on the advantages of viewpoint diversity in the\n\nclassroom, while Lynn emphasizes the positive impact of racial\n\ndiversity on student safety and attendance. But it is natural that\n\nsafety and attendance issues will loom larger in elementary and\n\nsecondary schools than in graduate schools.       Conversely, lively\n\n\n     8\n      Notably, one of the studies that the Supreme Court cited as\ndemonstrating that diversity produces educational benefits was\nauthored by the defendants' expert in this case, Dr. Gary Orfield.\n\n                                -27-\n\fclassroom discussion is a more central form of learning in law\n\nschools (which prefer the Socratic method) than in a K-12 setting.\n\nThese differences do not negate a compelling interest in racial\n\ndiversity in a K-12 setting.       Instead, they are the logical result\n\nof context.\n\n            We are persuaded by the extensive expert testimony in the\n\nrecord, rooted in observations specific to Lynn, that there are\n\nsignificant educational benefits to be derived from a racially\n\ndiverse student body in the K-12 context.

Thus we consider these cases further.\n\n            1. Gratz and Grutter\n\n            Gratz     involved   a     challenge        to    the   University     of\n\nMichigan's    undergraduate      admissions        program.         The   University\n\nautomatically assigned twenty points -- one-fifth of the 100 points\n\nnecessary    to   guarantee   admission       --   to    an   applicant     from   an\n\nunderrepresented racial or ethnic minority group.                   Gratz, 539 U.S.\n\nat 255.     This twenty-point bonus effectively made race/ethnicity\n\ndeterminative for minimally qualified minority applicants.                    Id. at\n\n272.   Grutter involved a challenge to the University of Michigan\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fLaw School's admissions policy.             The Law School took race into\n\naccount as one of several variables in an individual's application.\n\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 340.         It assigned no mechanical score based on\n\nan applicant's race; instead, it considered race only as one of\n\nseveral possible ways in which an applicant could enrich the\n\ndiversity of the student body.            Id. at 315-16.\n\n            The     Supreme     Court     struck    down       the    undergraduate\n\nadmissions plan in Gratz while upholding the law school admissions\n\npolicy in Grutter.            In arriving at these decisions, the Court\n\nfollowed a four-part narrow tailoring inquiry.                       First, a race-\n\nconscious     program    cannot    institutionalize        a    quota    system    or\n\notherwise insulate one category of applicants from competition with\n\nanother solely because of race.                Id.; Gratz, 539 U.S. at 334.\n\nSecond,    the    government     must    consider    whether         there   are   any\n\nworkable, race-neutral alternatives.               Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339.\n\nThird, the plan must not \"unduly harm members of any racial group.\"\n\nId. at 341.      Fourth, the use of racial distinctions must be limited\n\nin time.    Id. at 342.\n\n            Much of this inquiry is relevant here despite significant\n\ndifferences between the competitive admissions plans at issue in\n\nGratz and Grutter and the Lynn Plan, which is non-competitive and\n\ngoverns only student transfers, not initial assignments.                           The\n\nrequirement      that   the    court    consider   race-neutral        alternatives\n\naddresses whether the Plan is necessary; if there were a race-\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\fneutral way to achieve the benefits of diversity and reduced racial\n\nisolation, the use of race would be unnecessary and therefore not\n\nnarrowly tailored.        The requirements that a race-conscious policy\n\nnot unduly harm members of any racial group and that it be limited\n\nin time minimize the scope of the Plan, ensuring that its use of\n\nrace   is     no    broader    than     necessary.      The    weight    of   these\n\nconsiderations may vary somewhat from the Grutter setting to ours,\n\nbut they remain applicable and we will return to them shortly.\n\n             The first Grutter criterion relating to competition,\n\nhowever, is less useful to our narrow tailoring inquiry.

Because transfers\n\n\n     9\n      As we have already discussed, see supra Part III.B., the Lynn\nPlan's focus on racial diversity rather than viewpoint diversity is\nthe result of contextual differences between higher education,\nwhere the emphasis is on the exchange of ideas, and primary\neducation, where the emphasis is on fostering interracial\ncooperation.     The district court explained this point in\ndistinguishing Grutter, which was then pending before the Supreme\nCourt:\n     In contrast [to Grutter], the \"critical mass\" sought by\n     the Lynn Plan is different, because Lynn's goal is not\n     viewpoint diversity. As I have said, at the elementary,\n     middle, and high school level, the goal of teaching\n     socialization is at least as important as the subject\n     matter of instruction. The value of a diverse classroom\n     setting at these ages does not inhere in the range of\n     perspectives and experience that students can offer in\n     discussions; rather, diversity is valuable because it\n     enables students to learn racial tolerance by building\n     cross-racial relationships. In this context a meaningful\n     presence of racial minorities -- and of whites at\n     minority-dominated schools -- is crucial not only to\n     reducing feelings of tokenism, but also to disarming\n     stereotypes that students in the classroom majority might\n     harbor about students of other races.\nComfort IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Breadth\n\n           The defendants maintain that the Plan's use of race is\n\nminimally invasive.     First, it governs only voluntary transfers,\n\nrather than initial student assignments.                Instead of forcing\n\nchildren to attend schools far from their homes, as might be the\n\n\n\n\nof diversity vary at schools in the district; (ii) that at least\none school slipped below critical mass during the 2000-01 academic\nyear; and (iii) that defense experts testified that all schools\nthey visited -- including schools that had slipped below critical\nmass -- demonstrated the benefits that intergroup contact theory\nattributes to racial diversity.       Plaintiffs reason that the\nexperts' uniformly positive testimony is inconsistent with a theory\nthat increased diversity produces increased benefits, and that the\nbenefits must be attributable instead to race-neutral factors\npresent in equal measure throughout the district. We do not find\nthis argument persuasive. The defendants point out that although\nsome of Lynn's schools occasionally fall below critical mass, those\ndeviations are small and temporary. Students do not automatically\nforfeit the lessons learned from integration when they attend a\nschool with relatively short-term or marginal deviation from\ncritical mass.\n\n                                    -35-\n\fresult of a controlled choice plan,12 the Lynn Plan preserves the\n\ntraditional neighborhood school model.    Second, the Plan allows\n\nstudents to transfer freely between racially balanced schools and\n\nprovides an appeals process for students whose transfer requests\n\nare denied on racial grounds.13\n\n          The Plan is also less burdensome on third parties here\n\nthan in other contexts because of the nature of the \"benefit\" at\n\nissue, namely the grant of a transfer request.   Every child in Lynn\n\nis guaranteed a seat in a district where, as the parties have\n\nstipulated, every school provides a comparable education.       The\n\ndenial of a transfer under the Plan is therefore markedly different\n\nfrom the denial of a spot at a unique or selective educational\n\ninstitution.   See, e.g., Gratz, 539 U.S. at 251 (University of\n\nMichigan); Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 793 (Boston Latin School); cf.\n\n\n\n     12\n      Controlled choice plans are an alternative to neighborhood\nschool assignments.     See, e.g., Anderson, 375 F.3d at 74-77\n(describing controlled choice plans used by the Boston Public\nSchools). \"Under such programs, parents can choose among a select\nnumber of schools, but their choices and their likelihood of\ngetting their choice are controlled to help ensure a particular\nracial balance.\" Wendy Parker, The Legal Cost of the \"Split Double\nHeader\" of Gratz and Grutter, 31 Hastings Const.

Denial       of   a   future   employment\n\nopportunity is not as intrusive as loss of an existing job.\").\n\nThis is not to say that the denial imposes no harm at all; the\n\ntransfer request itself indicates that despite the availability of\n\na comparable education at any school in Lynn, students (or their\n\nparents) do not view the schools as fungible.

Calibration\n\n           Despite the minimally invasive nature of the Plan, the\n\nplaintiffs contend that it imposes undue harm because of its\n\ncalibration.     Emphasizing the defense experts' testimony that the\n\neducational benefits of diversity are predicated on the presence of\n\na critical mass of white and nonwhite students, a figure that\n\nsocial science literature approximates at 20%, the plaintiffs\n\nassert that the Plan's numerical guidelines are substantially more\n\nrestrictive     than   necessary.    In    their    view,    a   plan   narrowly\n\ntailored to the defendants' compelling interest in the benefits of\n\neducational diversity would prohibit only those transfers that\n\nwould upset critical mass.     They point out that because the Plan is\n\ncalibrated around district demographics rather than around critical\n\n\n                                    -37-\n\fmass, it prohibits some transfers that do not bring a school\n\npopulation below 20% white. For example, because nonwhites made up\n\n58%   of   Lynn's     student      population     at    the   time    of    trial,   an\n\nelementary school with a 40% nonwhite enrollment qualified as\n\nracially isolated, and therefore subject to transfer limits, even\n\nthough     it    contained     a    critical     mass   of    white   and    nonwhite\n\nstudents.14\n\n                In response, the defendants rely on expert testimony that\n\nwhile critical mass is the point at which educational benefits\n\nbegin to accrue, those benefits increase as a school nears an even\n\nbalance between white and nonwhite students.                     Relying on this\n\nevidence, the district court found that \"gains occur along a\n\ncontinuum: as the racial composition of school populations creeps\n\ncloser to balanced, racial stereotyping and tension is [sic]\n\nreduced and racial harmony and understanding increase.\"                       Comfort\n\nIV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

It thus concluded that the Plan was\n\nnarrowly        tailored,    despite     its     orientation     around      district\n\ndemographics rather than critical mass.                 See id. at 384 (The Plan\n\n\"effectively       generates       integration    in    Lynn's   schools      in   such\n\nquantity as to catalyze intergroup contact while still respecting\n\n\n\n      14\n      Under the Plan, an elementary school is racially isolated if\nits nonwhite enrollment falls more than 15% below the percentage of\nLynn's total student population that is nonwhite.        If Lynn's\nstudent population was 58% nonwhite, as it was during the 2001-02\nacademic year, a school whose student body was less than 43%\nnonwhite (i.e., more than 15% below 58%) was racially isolated.\n\n                                         -38-\n\fthe   neighborhood           school   principle      and     Lynn's   ever-changing\n\ndemographics.\").\n\n             We agree with the district court's reasoning.                 The Plan\n\ndoes not seek racial balancing for its own sake, nor does it use\n\nrigid quotas to ensure a pre-determined level of diversity at each\n\nof Lynn's schools.            See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 335-36 (\"The . . .\n\ngoal of attaining a critical mass of [nonwhite] students does not\n\ntransform [a] program into a quota.\"). Rather, the transfer policy\n\nconditioned on district demographics (+/- 10-15%) reflects the\n\ndefendants' efforts to obtain the benefits of diversity in a stable\n\nlearning environment.15 The Plan thus provides a sufficiently close\n\n\"fit\" to the defendants' compelling interest to ensure that \"'the\n\nmotive     for   the    classification     was       [not]    illegitimate   racial\n\nprejudice or stereotype.'\" Id. at 333 (quoting Croson, 488 U.S. at\n\n493 (plurality op.)).\n\n             The plaintiffs launch a second attack at the Plan's\n\ncalibration      on    the    grounds   that    it   is    inconsistent   with   the\n\ndefendants' statements that the benefits they seek maximize as a\n\nschool moves closer to 50% white/nonwhite.                   They point out that as\n\nof December 2004, Lynn's student population was more than 61.9%\n\n\n\n      15\n      This conclusion is bolstered by the testimony of Dr. Orfield,\na nationally recognized expert on school desegregation, who\nconcluded that the Plan \"used race no more than was necessary to\nallow Lynn to meet its educational goal of preparing students to\nlive in a multiracial society.\" Comfort IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

A middle school that is 50% minority (the proportion\n\nthat the defendants have described as ideal) would now fall outside\n\nof the +/- 10% range for racial balance and would instead be\n\nconsidered racially isolated, resulting in transfer limitations.\n\n            This argument misses the mark.   The Lynn Plan's goal is\n\nto improve the racial balance not of any particular school, but\n\nacross the school system as a whole.     The optimal balance for each\n\nschool might well be 50%, but Lynn's 61.9% minority population\n\nmeans that for every school closer to that ideal, another will be\n\nfurther away from it.        Evaluating schools by reference to the\n\nracial composition of the city's population is a sensible way for\n\nLynn to strive for the best racial balance attainable across its\n\nentire   school    system,    while   acknowledging   that   practical\n\nconstraints make it impossible for Lynn to have an equal population\n\nof minority and non-minority students in every individual school.\n\n            ii.

However, this white/nonwhite distinction reflects the\n\nreality of Lynn's experience.

They point\n\nspecifically       to    a   Department      of     Education      study    reviewing\n\nsuccessful race-neutral programs based on socioeconomic status or\n\na lottery, see U.S. Dep't of Educ., Achieving Diversity: Race-\n\nNeutral Alternatives in American Education (Feb. 2004), available\n\nat http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/raceneutral.html, and\n\nto the race-neutral student assignment plan adopted in Boston, see\n\nAnderson,   375     F.3d     at    76-77.      As    noted,     Lynn   has    already\n\nconsidered,    and       rejected,    the    possibility      of    basing    student\n\nassignments on socioeconomic status or a lottery. While the record\n\ndoes not reflect whether Lynn has considered the Boston plan in\n\ndepth, we note that the Boston plan is specific to the residential\n\npatterns in Boston, which differ from those in Lynn.                       Lynn must\n\nkeep abreast of possible alternatives as they develop, see Grutter,\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\f539 U.S. at 342-43, but it need not prove the impracticability of\n\nevery conceivable model for racial integration.                  It is sufficient\n\nthat it demonstrate a good faith effort to consider feasible race-\n\nneutral alternatives, as it has done here.             We therefore hold that\n\nthe Lynn Plan is narrowly tailored to the defendants' compelling\n\ninterest in obtaining the benefits of racial diversity.\n\nD.

It is to be interpreted in the sense most\n      obvious to the common intelligence. Its phrases are to\n      be read and construed according to the familiar and\n      approved usage of the language.        The words of a\n      constitutional provision are to be given their natural\n      and obvious sense according to common and approved usage\n      at the time of its adoption.\n           Moreover, the Constitution is to be interpreted in\n      the light of the conditions under which it and its\n\n\n      18\n      The defendants assert that we should not consider the\nsubstance of the Article 111 claim at all, maintaining that the\nCommonwealth was a necessary party to adjudicate this claim but\ncould not be joined because of the Eleventh Amendment, see Fed.

Id. at\n\n524. The plaintiffs contend that the plain language of the Article\n\nunequivocally invalidates the Lynn Plan.         They reason that when a\n\nstudent is precluded from transferring because of the transfer's\n\nimpact on racial balance, that student is \"denied admittance to a\n\npublic school on the basis of race\" within the meaning of Article\n\n111.\n\n            It is not readily apparent, however, that a student\n\ndenied a transfer is \"denied admittance\" to a school within the\n\nmeaning of the provision.        The Article's pairing of the terms\n\n\"assigned\" and \"denied admittance\" suggests that it contemplated\n\ninitial student placements, not subsequent transfers.              Under the\n\nLynn Plan, students are assigned to their neighborhood schools\n\nwithout regard to race; conversely, no student is denied that\n\nplacement based on race.     Only after a student has been assigned to\n\na school and wishes to transfer does race enter the calculus.\n\n            The \"specific circumstances of the adoption\" of Article\n\n111, see McDuffy, 615 N.E.2d at 528, convince us that the provision\n\n\n                                   -47-\n\fdoes not preclude such a plan.             Article 111 was adopted as an\n\namendment to the Massachusetts constitution in 1978. The House and\n\nSenate bills that became Article 111 were introduced by legislators\n\non behalf of Massachusetts Citizens Against Forced Busing.

When the bill was presented to\n\nvoters for ratification, the constitutionally required description\n\nthat accompanied it19 explained:\n\n     A \"YES VOTE\" would guarantee the right of parents or\n     guardians of school-age children to educate those\n     children free from any arbitrary assignment by school\n     authorities to schools outside the school district.

Supp. at 395 (quoting McDuffy, 615\n\nN.E.2d at 523).     The Lynn Plan advances those goals.               It protects\n\nneighborhood school assignments and does not entail any forced non-\n\nneighborhood assignments.         Race-conscious transfers occur only if\n\ninitiated by a student's parent or guardian, a result entirely\n\nconsistent with the explanation of the Article put before the\n\nvoters.\n\n            The plaintiffs do not dispute that Article 111 was\n\ndesigned to prevent forced busing.                Rather, they argue that any\n\ninquiry into the Article's legislative history is improper because\n\nthe provision is clear on its face.           As we have already explained,\n\nthe   application    of   the     Article    to    the   context   of    voluntary\n\ntransfers is not entirely clear from the statutory language.\n\nMoreover,    the    SJC     has   expressly        provided    that     the   state\n\nconstitution's words \"must be given a construction adapted to carry\n\ninto effect its purpose.\"         Cohen v.

We have already determined\n\nthat the Lynn Plan survives the strict scrutiny required by the\n\nfederal Equal Protection Clause.

See,   e.g.,\n\nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 227.            But such rubrics depend on degree and\n\ncontext; there is no yardstick that crisply determines when an\n\ninterest is compelling enough or how narrow is sufficiently so.\n\nThe way the Lynn plan uses race is certainly more benign than laws\n\nthat favor or disfavor one race, segregate by race, or create\n\nquotas for or against a racial group.\n\n             The goal of the Lynn plan--to achieve the educational and\n\ncivic benefits of exposing youngsters to those of different races--\n\nis not unlawful; the attack is upon the means.                Yet given the goal,\n\nit is not easy to see how it can be achieved in a community like\n\n\n                                           -57-\n\fLynn without using race as a touchstone.        The problem is that in\n\nLynn, as in many other cities, minorities and whites often live in\n\ndifferent neighborhoods.     Lynn's aim is to preserve local schools\n\nas an option without having the housing pattern of de facto\n\nsegregation projected into the school system.             The choice is\n\nbetween openly using race as a criterion or concealing it through\n\nsome clumsier proxy device (e.g., transfer restrictions based upon\n\nfamily income).\n\n          If   the   plan   were   patently   offensive   to    core   equal\n\nprotection principles, this would be an easy case.             But the Lynn\n\nplan is far from the original evils at which the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment was addressed. The Fourteenth Amendment sought to forbid\n\nthe oppression of one race by another.        We are here working from\n\ndoctrines concerning the use of race-based criteria that are mainly\n\nthe product of twentieth-century jurisprudence. This is not a case\n\nin which, against the background of core principles, all doubts\n\nshould be resolved against constitutionality.\n\n          Rather, we are faced with a local experiment, pursuing\n\nplausible goals by novel means that are not squarely condemned by\n\npast Supreme Court precedent.        The problems that the Lynn plan\n\naddresses are real, and time is more likely than court hearings to\n\ntell us whether the solution is a good one; indeed, indications so\n\nfar are that Lynn's efforts have met with success.         To bring that\n\nsuccess to a halt in this court seems neither advisable nor\n\n\n                                   -58-\n\fnecessary.    The Supreme Court has not passed upon a plan anything\n\nlike the     one   before   us.   That    Court   is   free   to   extend   its\n\nprecedents to the present context, but that is its role--not ours.\n\nCf. State Oil Co. v.

While no two cases are exactly alike, the\n\nfunction   of    the    judiciary    in   passing      upon    a   constitutional\n\nchallenge is to read the pertinent text of the Constitution,\n\nexamine the universe of relevant legal precedents, extract guiding\n\nprinciples from that case law, and apply those principles to the\n\nfacts at hand.         This case, like most cases, presents a factual\n\nscenario that contains certain idiosyncratic elements.

The majority\n\naccentuates those idiosyncracies, but chooses to overlook the\n\nelephant in the room:        the fact that this case arises against a\n\nbackdrop of Supreme Court jurisprudence, recently revisited in\n\nGrutter v.

The two\n\nlatest Supreme Court decisions illustrate the point.                         I begin by\n\nbriefly rehearsing the facts upon which those decisions turned.\n\n                   Gratz involved the University of Michigan's undergraduate\n\nadmissions program.                 The University automatically assigned 20\n\npoints — one-fifth of the 100 points needed to guarantee admission\n\n—   to        an   applicant    from    an   underrepresented      racial    or    ethnic\n\nminority group.               Gratz, 539 U.S. at 255.          This 20-point bonus\n\neffectively            made    race/ethnicity       determinative      for    minimally\n\nqualified minority applicants.                Id. at 272.\n\n                   Grutter involved law school admissions.             The law school\n\ntook      race       into     account   as   one    of   several   variables       in   an\n\nindividual's application.               Grutter, 539 U.S. at 340.            The school\n\nassigned no mechanical score based on an applicant's race; instead,\n\nit considered race only as one of several possible ways in which an\n\napplicant could enrich the diversity of the student body.                          Id. at\n\n315-16.            Moreover, the school set no quotas for racial or ethnic\n\nminorities.           Id. at 335-36.\n\n\n\n         21\n      While such methods may be justified to remedy the effects of\npast discrimination, see, e.g., Swann v.

In arriving at these\n\ndecisions, the Court made it crystal clear that a race-conscious\n\nadmissions program must use race in \"a flexible, non-mechanical\n\nway\" if it is to be considered narrowly tailored (and, thus, if it\n\nis to pass constitutional muster).            Id. at 334.    Such a plan cannot\n\ninstitutionalize a quota system or in any way insulate one category\n\nof applicants from another solely on account of race.                    See id.;\n\nGratz, 539 U.S. at 258, 270-72.          Race can, however, be used as a\n\nplus factor in the course of individualized consideration of each\n\napplicant.      Grutter, 539 U.S. at 334.\n\n             The majority, emphasizing that context matters, simply\n\nwrites this requirement out of the narrow-tailoring analysis.\n\nThat, to me, requires more than a soupcon of legal legerdemain.\n\nWhile    I   agree    that   context   matters,       the   Supreme    Court     has\n\ncatalogued a compendium of dangers flowing from the mechanical,\n\ninflexible, and exclusive use of race as a determinant.                   For one\n\nthing,   such    an    approach   insulates     the    preferred      category    of\n\napplicants from competition with other applicants.                 Grutter, 539\n\nU.S. at 334.          For another thing, such an approach feeds the\n\nstereotype that students from the preferred group lack academic\n\nmerit and, thus, raises the specter of stigmatic harm.

See Johnson v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137748\"><a href=\"/opinion/137748/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To\n\nillustrate,    consider    that    the   Plan   can   succeed      only   if   the\n\nopportunity to transfer to a distant school is attractive to\n\nparents.     It is conceivable that some parents would transfer a\n\nchild out of a desire to have the child learn in a more integrated\n\nenvironment. But the Lynn Plan actively creates and exploits other\n\nmethods of benign coercion in search of its goal.               For instance,\n\nLynn admits that a major function of its \"theme\" schools is to\n\nentice parents to transfer their children.                  Another method is\n\nselling convenience to parents.          School officials are aware that\n\nsome of schools are located near after-school programs or near\n\nhigh-employment areas.          Every student, of every race, in every\n\nschool     zone,   has   some   potential   benefit     —    yet    the   school\n\ncommittee's policy evaluates whether students may take part in the\n\ntransfer program based solely on the color of a student's skin.\n\nOnly after experiencing a racially based rejection can an affected\n\nstudent plead for relief from the stated policy.\n\n             In one sense, then, this plan is even more harmful than\n\nthe racially inflexible program struck down in Gratz.                     There,\n\nprospective non-minority students could be admitted by the terms of\n\n\n                                     -64-\n\fthe policy itself and thus those who were rejected could look to\n\nsomething other than race as a reason for their failure.\n\n          The majority writes off these concerns, stating that\n\nLynn's goal is increased racial harmony for the student body as a\n\nwhole.    But the end cannot be allowed to justify the use of\n\nunconstitutional means; even laudable goals must be attained in\n\nconstitutional ways.      The Lynn Plan's inflexible use of race\n\noffends this principle.\n\n          Moreover, the majority's attempted justification misses\n\na crucial point.    The Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals,\n\nnot groups.   Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227\n\n(1995). There is a harm inflicted on a student when her government\n\ndenies her transfer for the sole or determinative reason of race —\n\nan immutable condition that she cannot change. That harm cannot be\n\nignored simply because it serves what others (be they school\n\ncommittee members or my distinguished colleagues) perceive as a\n\ngreater good.      Cf. Grutter, U.S. at 341 (holding that narrow\n\ntailoring requires program to not unduly harm members of any racial\n\ngroup).\n\n          If more were needed — and I doubt that it is — the\n\nmechanical use of race is not necessary to meet the compelling\n\ninterests that Lynn asserts here.      A flexible, race-conscious\n\ntransfer program, creating a strong but non-determinative \"plus\"\n\nfactor for integrative transfers but permitting other transfers\n\n\n                                -65-\n\fbased on the strength of individual requests, would serve to\n\nincrease diversity and avoid the harm arising from an unflinching\n\nuse of race.        The children rejected for transfer under such a plan\n\nwould not be rejected solely because of the color of their skin but\n\nbecause    the      reasons   supporting      their    transfer      requests       were\n\ncomparatively         insubstantial.          That     kind    of    harm      is    not\n\nconstitutionally suspect.\n\n               Lynn hardly can be heard to complain that such a plan is\n\nunworkable. By its own admission, it already allows more than half\n\nof the students denied transfers under its race-based policy to\n\nhave an exemption for non-race-related reasons.                     These transfers\n\nhave not       undermined     the   benefits     of   diversity     in   the    school\n\ncommunity.          The city persists, however, in subjecting all the\n\nstudents who request transfers to what is in effect a two-tier\n\nprocess — one in which the student is evaluated solely on the basis\n\nof color and a second in which a rejected student must convince the\n\nschool that his or her color should not matter.\n\n               Many good things can be said about the Lynn Plan.                    I do\n\nnot doubt that it is well-intentioned and that it has helped to\n\npromote    greater      diversity     in   the    public      schools.      But      the\n\noverriding fact is that it unnecessarily inflicts racially based\n\nwounds    on    a    large    and   diverse    group    of    its    students       and,\n\nconsequently, fails to satisfy the narrow-tailoring requirement set\n\nout in the Supreme Court's equal protection jurisprudence. Because\n\n\n                                       -66-\n\fthat is so, I must respectfully dissent from what I view to be an\n\nerroneous decision.\n\n\n\n\n                              -67-\n\f</pre>",
