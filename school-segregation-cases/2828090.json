Dr. Wright’s certification indicated\nthat the neck injury required Mitchell’s occasional absence           On May 15, 1997, Mitchell provided to Derrickson a letter\nfrom work.

Notwithstanding this                 See 29 U.S.C. § 2611(4)(A)(i) & (ii). However, when the\nrepeated and consistent use of the em dash, Section                  public agency provision is introduced into an interpretation\n2611(4)(A) lacks any punctuation demonstrating an inter-             with clauses (i) and (ii), the statute provides -- “the term\nrelationship between clauses (ii)-(iv).

In the absence of such guidance, and in                 interstate commerce . . . who employs fifty or more\naccordance with the plain text’s separation of the clauses into      employees; and any successor in interest of the public agency\ndistinct provisions, the structure of Section 2611(4)(A)             . . .engaged in interstate commerce . . . who employs fifty or\npatently demonstrates that the individual liability provision        more employees . . . .” See 29 U.S.C. 2611(4)(A)(i),(ii), &\nand public agency provision are separate and distinct.

An examination of Section 2611(4)(A)’s text and            several oddities.\nstructure demonstrates that the individual liability provision\nand public agency provision are separate and distinct.

In accordance with this              in interstate commerce . . . who employees 50 or more\npractice, Section 2611(4)(A) implements the em dash into its         employees . . .; and includes any person who acts directly or\ndefinition of employer.

Notwithstanding this                 See 29 U.S.C. § 2611(4)(A)(i) & (ii). However, when the\nrepeated and consistent use of the em dash, Section                  public agency provision is introduced into an interpretation\n2611(4)(A) lacks any punctuation demonstrating an inter-             with clauses (i) and (ii), the statute provides -- “the term\nrelationship between clauses (ii)-(iv). Indeed, the separation       employer means any person engaged in interstate commerce\nof otherwise related concepts (i.e., what the term “employer”        . . . who employees 50 or more employees . . .; and includes\n“includes”) into distinctly enumerated clauses compels an            any person who acts directly or indirectly in the interest of\ninterpretation that treats each clause in an independent             any person engaged in interstate commerce . . .who employs\nmanner.

In the absence of such guidance, and in                 interstate commerce . . . who employs fifty or more\naccordance with the plain text’s separation of the clauses into      employees; and any successor in interest of the public agency\ndistinct provisions, the structure of Section 2611(4)(A)             . . .engaged in interstate commerce . . . who employs fifty or\npatently demonstrates that the individual liability provision        more employees . . . .” See 29 U.S.C. 2611(4)(A)(i),(ii), &\nand public agency provision are separate and distinct.
