INTRODUCTION\n              Clinton DesJarlais filed an application with the Office of the Lieutenant\nGovernor seeking certification of an initiative that would generally prohibit abortion.\nThe lieutenant governor, acting on the advice of the Department of Law, concluded that\nthe initiative was unconstitutional and declined to certify it for circulation. DesJarlais\n\ffiled suit against the State in superior court challenging the lieutenant governor’s\ndecision. The superior court granted summary judgment in favor of the State and\nDesJarlais appeals. Because DesJarlais’s proposed initiative is clearly unconstitutional\nunder controlling United States Supreme Court precedent, we affirm the superior court’s\ngrant of summary judgment.\nII.   FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n             In November 2010 the Office of the Lieutenant Governor received an\napplication1 for the “Natural Right to Life Initiative.” DesJarlais is one of the co­\nsponsors of the initiative. Known as 10NRTL, the initiative proposes the following bill:\n                             Natural Right to Life Initiative\n             BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF\n             ALASKA\n             *Section. 1. AS 18. is amended by adding a new chapter to\n             read:\n             Chapter. 18.01. Natural Right to Life.\n             *Section. 2. 18.01. is amended by adding a new section to\n             read:\n             Section. 18.01.01. Natural Right to Life. The State of\n             Alaska shall protect the natural right to life and body of all\n             mankind from the beginning of biological development. We\n             the People affirm that the natural right to life and body of the\n             unborn child supercedes the statutory right of the mother to\n             consent to the injury or death of her unborn child. In life\n             threatening situations the law of necessity shall dictate\n\n\n      1\n               An initiative is proposed by filing an application with the lieutenant\ngovernor. AS 15.45.020. The lieutenant governor has 60 calendar days to either certify\nthe initiative or notify the initiative committee of the grounds for denial. AS 15.45.070.\nUpon certification, the initiative proceeds to the petition stage, where the initiative\nsponsors circulate it and gather signatures supporting its inclusion on the ballot.\nAS 14.45.090-220.\n\n                                           -2-                                      6777\n\n\f             between the life of the mother and her child.\n             In January 2011, in response to a request from Lieutenant Governor Mead\nTreadwell, the Department of Law reviewed the application for compliance with the\nstatutes that prescribe Alaska’s initiative process, AS 15.45.040 2 and AS 15.45.080.3\nThe Department concluded that 10NRTL “is intended to extinguish a woman’s\n\n\n      2\t\n             AS 15.45.040 provides:\n             The proposed bill shall be in the following form:\n             (1) the bill shall be confined to one subject;\n             (2) the subject of the bill shall be expressed in the title;\n             (3) the enacting clause of the bill shall be: “Be it enacted by\n             the People of the State of Alaska;”\n             (4) the bill may not include subjects restricted by\n             AS 15.45.010.\n             AS 15.45.010 provides:\n             The law-making powers assigned to the legislature may be\n             exercised by the people through the initiative. However, an\n             initiative may not be proposed to dedicate revenue, to make\n             or repeal appropriations, to create courts, to define the\n             jurisdiction of courts or prescribe their rules, or to enact local\n             or special legislation.\n\n      3\t\n             AS 15.45.080 provides:\n             The lieutenant governor shall deny certification upon\n             determining in writing that\n             (1) the proposed bill to be initiated is not confined to one\n             subject or is otherwise not in the required form:\n             (2) the application is not substantially in the required form; or\n             (3) there is an insufficient number of qualified sponsors.\n\n                                            -3-\t                                  6777\n\n\fconstitutional right to privacy as recognized by the United States Supreme Court and the\nAlaska Supreme Court.”4 It therefore determined that the proposed bill would be\n“clearly unconstitutional” and in violation of the prohibited-subject requirement of\nAS 15.45.040, and advised the lieutenant governor not to certify the initiative.5 The\nlieutenant governor followed the Department’s recommendation and informed DesJarlais\nof the State’s decision in a January 11, 2011 letter.\n              On February 11, 2011, DesJarlais filed a complaint in superior court\nchallenging the lieutenant governor’s denial of his application. DesJarlais filed an\nadditional pleading on September 16, 2011 that appeared to amend his complaint to add\nadditional claims and requests for relief. The State did not oppose the additional\npleading but instead moved for summary judgment on all claims.\n              On November 9, 2011, Superior Court Judge Patrick J. McKay granted the\nState’s motion for summary judgment and found that “[a] law forbidding abortion is\n‘clearly unconstitutional’ under controlling U.S. Supreme Court and Alaska Supreme\nCourt precedent. . . . DesJarlais’ proposed bill is ‘clearly unconstitutional.’ ” Following\nthe grant of summary judgment, DesJarlais petitioned the superior court to order the\nState’s attorneys to produce proof of their law licenses. The superior court declined to\nissue any such order.\n              DesJarlais appeals, proceeding pro se.\nIII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n              “We review grants of summary judgment de novo, exercising our own\nindependent judgment to determine whether the parties genuinely dispute any material\nfacts and, if not, whether the disputed facts entitle the moving party to judgment as a\n\n\n       4\n              See 2009-11 A TT ’Y G EN .

The Lieutenant Governor Properly Refused To Certify 10NRTL.\n              1.\t    The State can refuse to certify an initiative where controlling\n                     authority establishes its unconstitutionality.\n              Article XI, section 1 of the Alaska Constitution guarantees the people of\nAlaska the right to enact laws by initiative: “The people may propose and enact laws by\nthe initiative, and approve or reject acts of the legislature by the referendum.” This\nguarantee is not without limits.       The Alaska Constitution sets forth procedural\nrequirements that must be followed, as well as restraints on subject matter. Article XI,\nsection 7 sets forth most of the subject matter restrictions: “The initiative shall not be\nused to dedicate revenues, make or repeal appropriations, create courts, define the\njurisdiction of courts or prescribe their rules, or enact local or special legislation.”\nArticle XII, section 11 also provides, “Unless clearly inapplicable, the law-making\npowers assigned to the legislature may be exercised by the people through the initiative,\nsubject to the limitations of Article XI.”8 These constitutional limitations are codified\n\n\n       6\n             Kodiak Island Borough v. Mahoney, 71 P.3d 896, 897 (Alaska 2003)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); State Dep’t of Health & Soc. Servs. v.

Mahoney, we considered the circumstances under which a municipal clerk\nmay deny a petition as unconstitutional under controlling authority.12 Rejecting the\nBorough’s argument that a clerk may not certify an application for an initiative unless\nthe clerk can conclude unequivocally that the proposed ordinance will be enforceable as\na matter of law, we held that a clerk must presume an initiative to be constitutional absent\nclear authority establishing otherwise, and “may only reject on substantive grounds a\n\n\n       8\n              (...continued)\npower serves as a check on other branches of government, such as legislative power to\ndefine courts’ jurisdiction or override judicial rules.” Id. at 717 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n       9\n              Id.\n       10\n              Carmony v.

Wright, 971 P.2d 1025, 1027\n(Alaska 1999) (“General contentions that the provisions of an initiative are\nunconstitutional are justiciable only after the initiative has been enacted by the\nelectorate.”) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).\n       12\n              71 P.3d 896, 898 (Alaska 2003).\n\n                                            -6-                                        6777\n\n\fpre-election petition that proposes a clearly unconstitutional ordinance.”13 As an\nexample, we noted that “an initiative that is properly submitted procedurally but that\nproposes an ordinance mandating local school segregation based on race” would be\nclearly unconstitutional under controlling United States Supreme Court precedent.14\n             2.     10NRTL is clearly unconstitutional under controlling authority.\n             In Roe v. Wade, the United States Supreme Court held that a state may not\nenact a broad ban on abortion because such a ban would violate a person’s constitutional\nright to privacy.15 DesJarlais contends that Roe v. Wade is not controlling precedent\nbecause “[l]iving preborn children have natural rights to life.” DesJarlais further argues\nthat we “should review the Superior Court’s factual finding that Roe v. Wade is\ncontrolling Federal Case law as clearly erroneous standard. Human life begins at the\nbeginning of biological development. Therefore, preborn children have natural rights\nsecured by the Alaska Constitution Article 1 Section 1.” DesJarlais thus implicitly\nargues 16 that 10NRTL is not “clearly unconstitutional” because Roe v. Wade is not\ncontrolling authority.\n             The State responds that “the lieutenant governor properly refused to certify\n[10NRTL] and the superior court properly granted summary judgment to the state”\n\n      13\n             Id. at 898, 900 (emphasis added).\n      14\n              Id. at 900, n.22 (citing Brown v.

Wade and this\ncourt’s interpretation of the privacy clause of the Alaska Constitution, such a law would\nbe “clearly contrary to controlling constitutional precedent.” The State responds to\nDesJarlais’s contention that Roe v. Wade is not controlling authority by arguing,\n“Although there is always a possibility that courts will reconsider their past constitutional\nrulings, the lieutenant governor’s decision not to certify an initiative must be based on\nthe precedent that currently controls, not on speculation about whether that precedent\nwill be overturned.”\n              In granting the State’s motion for summary judgment, the superior court\nfound, “While not stating explicitly that the bill is meant to prevent abortions, the\nlanguage of the ‘Natural Right to Life Initiative,’ considered with statements DesJarlais\nmade in the application, indicates that the purpose of the proposed bill is to ban abortion\nin most cases.” The superior court, relying on Roe v. Wade and our decision in Valley\nHospital Association, Inc. v. Mat-Su Coalition for Choice,17 concluded that “[a] law\nforbidding abortion is ‘clearly unconstitutional’ under controlling U.S. Supreme Court\nand Alaska Supreme Court precedent. . . . Given these longstanding, controlling\nprecedents — which cannot be ignored by either the Office of the Lieutenant Governor\nor this Court — DesJarlais’ proposed bill is ‘clearly unconstitutional.’ ”\n              10NRTL does not explicitly state that it is intended to ban abortion, but it\nprovides that “the natural right to life and body of the unborn child supercedes the\nstatutory right of the mother to consent to the injury or death of her unborn child.” It\nexcepts only life-threatening situations, in which case “the law of necessity shall dictate\nbetween the life of the mother and her child.” DesJarlais further explained “the intent\n\n\n       17\n              948 P.2d 963 (Alaska 1997).\n\n                                            -8-                                        6777\n\fof the Law of Necessity” in his letter to the lieutenant governor requesting initiative\napproval:\n             The Law of Necessity means that in life threatening situations\n             any act(s) done with the best interests to preserve the life of\n             the mother and her child would be protected. For example a\n             firefighter, involved in [a] car accident, may assess that there\n             is such a case where both the life of the mother and her child\n             a [sic] certain to be lost unless something is done. If a\n             prosecution for the loss of life took place regarding the\n             actions taken under these circumstances then they would be\n             protected upon proof before a jury that the actions were done\n             to prevent the loss of life of both the mother and her unborn\n             child.\n             Controlling United States Supreme Court precedent establishes that a broad\nban on abortion would be “clearly unconstitutional.”18 In Roe v. Wade, the Court\nconsidered the constitutionality of Texas criminal abortion statutes that prohibited\nabortion at any stage of pregnancy except where necessary to save the life of the\nmother.19 The Court held that, although a woman’s right to an abortion is not absolute\nand must be considered against compelling state interests, a broad ban on abortion\nviolates a woman’s constitutional right to privacy: “[A] state criminal abortion statute\n. . . that excepts from criminality only a life-saving procedure on behalf of the mother,\nwithout regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests\ninvolved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourth Amendment.”20\n\n\n      18\n              See Roe, 410 U.S. at 164 (holding unconstitutional Texas criminal abortion\nstatutes prohibiting abortion at any stage of pregnancy except where necessary to save\nmother’s life).\n      19\n             Id. at 117-18.\n      20\n             Id. at 164.

Casey, 505 U.S.\n                                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                           -9-                                     6777\n\n\f              DesJarlais’s proposed bill would preclude abortion to at least the same\nextent as the Texas criminal statutes at issue in Roe v. Wade. The Texas statutes\nprovided exceptions for abortions where the mother’s life was threatened,21 whereas\nDesJarlais’s initiative would permit abortion only where dictated by “the law of\nnecessity,” in which case a defendant would still be subject to criminal prosecution.\nBecause DesJarlais’s initiative would prohibit abortion to an extent that the United States\nSupreme Court has deemed unconstitutional, it is “clearly unconstitutional” under\ncontrolling authority.\n       B.     The State Is Not Legally Obligated To Outlaw Abortion.\n              Relying on article I, section 1 of the Alaska Constitution, DesJarlais argues\nthat “the State of Alaska is Constitutionally bound to preserve life.” DesJarlais argues\nthat because human life begins at the beginning of biological development, “preborn\nchildren have natural rights secured by the Alaska Constitution Article 1 Section 1.” He\nthus implicitly argues that because “preborn children” are protected under the Alaska\nConstitution, the State is legally obligated to outlaw abortion.\n              The State responds that “DesJarlais’ arguments that various provisions of\nstate and federal law require the state to ban abortion are precluded by . . . controlling\ncaselaw . . . . [B]oth the U.S. Supreme Court and this Court have held that the federal\n\n\n\n       20\n               (...continued)\n833 (1992), a plurality of the Court adopted a different test than the “compelling state\ninterest” test employed in Roe, holding that a state may regulate abortions so long as the\nregulation does not impose an “undue burden” on the woman’s ability to decide to have\nan abortion.

However, the Court reaffirmed the central holding of Roe:\n“Regardless of whether exceptions are made for particular circumstances, a State may\nnot prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy\nbefore viability.” Id. at 875.\n       21\n              Roe, 410 U.S. at 117-18.\n\n                                           -10-                                      6777\n\n\fand state constitutions prohibit states from banning abortion.” The State thus argues that\n“the lieutenant governor . . . cannot have violated any state or federal law by failing to\nban abortion,” and summary judgment was properly granted.\n              Article I, section 1 of the Alaska Constitution provides:\n              This constitution is dedicated to the principles that all persons\n              have a natural right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness,\n              and the enjoyment of the rewards of their own industry; that\n              all persons are equal and entitled to equal rights,\n              opportunities, and protection under the law; and that all\n              persons have corresponding obligations to the people and to\n              the State.\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\nprovides its own protections to “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States,\nand subject to the jurisdiction thereof.”22\n              In Roe v. Wade, the United States Supreme Court expressly held that “the\nword ‘person,’ as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn.”23\nThus, even if the State has a constitutional duty to protect all persons’ natural right to\nlife, as DesJarlais asserts, this duty does not extend to the unborn under controlling\nfederal law. Furthermore, the Alaska Constitution cannot guarantee limitless protections\nto the unborn because Roe v. Wade precludes all states from guaranteeing protections to\n\n\n\n\n       22\n              U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.\n       23\n               410 U.S. at 158. DesJarlais argues that “[t]he Justices in Roe v. Wade stated\nthat life begins at conception (beginning of biological development).” But contrary to\nDesJarlais’s argument, Roe v. Wade does not state that life begins at conception. The\nCourt chose not to “resolve the difficult question of when life begins,” concluding that\nthe judiciary, “at this point in the development of man’s knowledge, is not in a position\nto speculate as to the answer.” Id. at 159.\n\n                                              -11-                                    6777\n\n\fthe unborn that would ultimately result in a broad ban on abortion.24\n             DesJarlais looks to other jurisdictions for support, arguing that “the U.S.\n8th Circuit Court Ruled that preborn children are alive in [Planned Parenthood\nMinnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota v. Rounds.]”25 We are not bound by the Eighth\nCircuit’s decision; rather, we are bound by controlling United States Supreme Court\nprecedent and Alaska Supreme Court precedent.26\n             DesJarlais additionally references the United States Constitution, the Bible,\nthe Declaration of Independence, maxims of law, the Nuremberg Trials, various Alaska\nstatutes and rules of procedure, and various dictionaries, apparently in support of his\nargument that the State should outlaw abortion. The State correctly responds that many\nof the sources cited by DesJarlais “cannot create cognizable legal claims.”\n             DesJarlais’s argument also fails to recognize that we are governed by\npositive constitutional law.27 We are bound to follow the text, structure, and binding\n\n\n\n\n      24\n             Id. at 164-65.\n      25\n             530 F.3d 724 (8th Cir. 2008) (en banc).\n      26\n              See Roe, 410 U.S. at 164-65; Valley Hosp. Ass’n, Inc. v. Mat-Su Coal. for\nChoice, 948 P.2d 963, 969 (Alaska 1997) (holding that reproductive rights, including the\nright to an abortion, are fundamental rights protected by the Alaska Constitution and\n“may be legally constrained only when the constraints are justified by a compelling state\ninterest, and no less restrictive means could advance that interest”).\n      27\n               See, e.g., Robert P. George, Justice, Legitimacy, and Allegiance: “The End\nof Democracy?” Symposium Revisited, 44 L OY . L. REV . 103, 109 (1998) (“The existence\nand scope of judicial power to invalidate democratically enacted laws, including laws\nwhose injustice compromises the principles of democracy itself, is settled not by natural\nlaw (i.e., the moral law), but by the positive constitutional law of a given democratic\npolity.”).\n\n                                          -12-                                      6777\n\n\finterpretations of the Constitution.28 Thus, neither we nor the lieutenant governor can\ninvalidate a recognized constitutional right, regardless of whether that right purportedly\nconflicts with natural law.\n       C.\t    DesJarlais Was Not Improperly Denied His Right To A Jury Trial.\n              DesJarlais argues that the superior court improperly “usurped the authority\nof the people by negating” his right to a jury trial. DesJarlais suggests that he was\nimproperly denied his right to a jury trial because his attorney failed to make a timely\nrequest on his behalf.\n              The question before the superior court — whether 10NRTL is “clearly\nunconstitutional” — was purely a legal question to be resolved by the judge, not by a\njury.29 DesJarlais’s case presented no factual questions that could have been resolved by\na jury; thus DesJarlais’s argument concerning his right to a jury trial is without merit.\n       D.\t    The Superior Court Did Not Improperly Refuse To Order The\n              Attorneys And Court To Produce Proof Of Their Law Licenses.\n              DesJarlais argues that judges and attorneys “have a duty to produce their\noath of office and license to practice law respectively to prove that they are properly\nauthorized to stand in their position.” He asserts that while he recognizes “there are\n\n\n\n      28\n              See, e.g., Philip A. Hamburger, Natural Rights, Natural Law, and American\nConstitutions, 102 Y ALE L.J. 907, 938 (1993) (“When saying that constitutions and other\ncivil laws should be formulated to reflect natural law, Americans typically were not\nsuggesting that natural law was a kind of constitutional law or a source for constitutional\nrights not protected by a written constitution. On the contrary, under modern natural\nrights analysis, constitutional law and natural law were quite distinct from one another\nand played very different roles.”).\n      29\n              See, e.g., Greywolf v. Carroll, 151 P.3d 1234, 1245 (Alaska 2007) (noting\nthat factual questions should be resolved by a jury); Dean v. Firor, 681 P.2d 321, 328\n(Alaska 1984) (noting that “the responsibility for deciding questions of law lies with the\njudiciary”).\n\n                                           -13-\t                                     6777\n\n\factive Alaska Bar Association numbers next to pleadings,” he has “never once seen a\nState of Alaska license number.” DesJarlais asks us to “specify what a valid State of\nAlaska license to practice law is, so that [he] is with knowledge that the defense lawyers\nare in compliance with License to Practice Law Statutes [sic].”\n              Alaska Statute 08.08.020 provides that “[e]very person licensed to practice\nlaw in the state shall become a member in the Alaska Bar.”30 The Alaska Bar Rules set\nforth the requirements for admission to the practice of law.31 An attorney or judge issued\na license number has necessarily met these requirements and is licensed to practice law\nin Alaska.\n              Alaska Rule of Civil Procedure 76 provides that if the person signing a\npleading or paper is an attorney, “the person’s Alaska Bar Association membership\nnumber must be entered following the person’s name.” Thus, the pleadings submitted\nby the attorneys in this case provide sufficient proof that the attorneys are authorized to\npractice law in the State of Alaska.\n              Finally, DesJarlais cites no authority for his claim that a judge has a duty\nto produce proof of oath of office. This argument is without merit.\nV.     CONCLUSION\n              We AFFIRM the superior court’s grant of summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n       30\n              AS 08.08.020(a).\n       31\n              See Alaska Bar R. 5.\n\n                                           -14-                                      6777\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n              Clinton DesJarlais filed an application with the Office of the Lieutenant\nGovernor seeking certification of an initiative that would generally prohibit abortion.\nThe lieutenant governor, acting on the advice of the Department of Law, concluded that\nthe initiative was unconstitutional and declined to certify it for circulation. DesJarlais\n\ffiled suit against the State in superior court challenging the lieutenant governor’s\ndecision. The superior court granted summary judgment in favor of the State and\nDesJarlais appeals. Because DesJarlais’s proposed initiative is clearly unconstitutional\nunder controlling United States Supreme Court precedent, we affirm the superior court’s\ngrant of summary judgment.\nII.   FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n             In November 2010 the Office of the Lieutenant Governor received an\napplication1 for the “Natural Right to Life Initiative.” DesJarlais is one of the co­\nsponsors of the initiative. Known as 10NRTL, the initiative proposes the following bill:\n                             Natural Right to Life Initiative\n             BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF\n             ALASKA\n             *Section. 1. AS 18. is amended by adding a new chapter to\n             read:\n             Chapter. 18.01. Natural Right to Life.\n             *Section. 2. 18.01. is amended by adding a new section to\n             read:\n             Section. 18.01.01. Natural Right to Life. The State of\n             Alaska shall protect the natural right to life and body of all\n             mankind from the beginning of biological development. We\n             the People affirm that the natural right to life and body of the\n             unborn child supercedes the statutory right of the mother to\n             consent to the injury or death of her unborn child. In life\n             threatening situations the law of necessity shall dictate\n\n\n      1\n               An initiative is proposed by filing an application with the lieutenant\ngovernor. AS 15.45.020. The lieutenant governor has 60 calendar days to either certify\nthe initiative or notify the initiative committee of the grounds for denial. AS 15.45.070.\nUpon certification, the initiative proceeds to the petition stage, where the initiative\nsponsors circulate it and gather signatures supporting its inclusion on the ballot.\nAS 14.45.090-220.\n\n                                           -2-                                      6777\n\n\f             between the life of the mother and her child.\n             In January 2011, in response to a request from Lieutenant Governor Mead\nTreadwell, the Department of Law reviewed the application for compliance with the\nstatutes that prescribe Alaska’s initiative process, AS 15.45.040 2 and AS 15.45.080.3\nThe Department concluded that 10NRTL “is intended to extinguish a woman’s\n\n\n      2\t\n             AS 15.45.040 provides:\n             The proposed bill shall be in the following form:\n             (1) the bill shall be confined to one subject;\n             (2) the subject of the bill shall be expressed in the title;\n             (3) the enacting clause of the bill shall be: “Be it enacted by\n             the People of the State of Alaska;”\n             (4) the bill may not include subjects restricted by\n             AS 15.45.010.\n             AS 15.45.010 provides:\n             The law-making powers assigned to the legislature may be\n             exercised by the people through the initiative. However, an\n             initiative may not be proposed to dedicate revenue, to make\n             or repeal appropriations, to create courts, to define the\n             jurisdiction of courts or prescribe their rules, or to enact local\n             or special legislation.\n\n      3\t\n             AS 15.45.080 provides:\n             The lieutenant governor shall deny certification upon\n             determining in writing that\n             (1) the proposed bill to be initiated is not confined to one\n             subject or is otherwise not in the required form:\n             (2) the application is not substantially in the required form; or\n             (3) there is an insufficient number of qualified sponsors.\n\n                                            -3-\t                                  6777\n\n\fconstitutional right to privacy as recognized by the United States Supreme Court and the\nAlaska Supreme Court.”4 It therefore determined that the proposed bill would be\n“clearly unconstitutional” and in violation of the prohibited-subject requirement of\nAS 15.45.040, and advised the lieutenant governor not to certify the initiative.5 The\nlieutenant governor followed the Department’s recommendation and informed DesJarlais\nof the State’s decision in a January 11, 2011 letter.\n              On February 11, 2011, DesJarlais filed a complaint in superior court\nchallenging the lieutenant governor’s denial of his application. DesJarlais filed an\nadditional pleading on September 16, 2011 that appeared to amend his complaint to add\nadditional claims and requests for relief. The State did not oppose the additional\npleading but instead moved for summary judgment on all claims.\n              On November 9, 2011, Superior Court Judge Patrick J. McKay granted the\nState’s motion for summary judgment and found that “[a] law forbidding abortion is\n‘clearly unconstitutional’ under controlling U.S. Supreme Court and Alaska Supreme\nCourt precedent. . . . DesJarlais’ proposed bill is ‘clearly unconstitutional.’ ” Following\nthe grant of summary judgment, DesJarlais petitioned the superior court to order the\nState’s attorneys to produce proof of their law licenses. The superior court declined to\nissue any such order.\n              DesJarlais appeals, proceeding pro se.\nIII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n              “We review grants of summary judgment de novo, exercising our own\nindependent judgment to determine whether the parties genuinely dispute any material\nfacts and, if not, whether the disputed facts entitle the moving party to judgment as a\n\n\n       4\n              See 2009-11 A TT ’Y G EN . O P . 333.\n       5\n              Id.\n\n                                            -4­                                      6777\n\fmatter of law.”6 Although we will liberally construe applicable constitutional and\nstatutory provisions when reviewing initiative challenges, we have a duty “to carefully\nconsider the initiative’s subject matter, given the constitutional limits on the people’s\nright of direct legislation.”7\nIV.\t   DISCUSSION\n       A.     The Lieutenant Governor Properly Refused To Certify 10NRTL.\n              1.\t    The State can refuse to certify an initiative where controlling\n                     authority establishes its unconstitutionality.\n              Article XI, section 1 of the Alaska Constitution guarantees the people of\nAlaska the right to enact laws by initiative: “The people may propose and enact laws by\nthe initiative, and approve or reject acts of the legislature by the referendum.” This\nguarantee is not without limits.       The Alaska Constitution sets forth procedural\nrequirements that must be followed, as well as restraints on subject matter. Article XI,\nsection 7 sets forth most of the subject matter restrictions: “The initiative shall not be\nused to dedicate revenues, make or repeal appropriations, create courts, define the\njurisdiction of courts or prescribe their rules, or enact local or special legislation.”\nArticle XII, section 11 also provides, “Unless clearly inapplicable, the law-making\npowers assigned to the legislature may be exercised by the people through the initiative,\nsubject to the limitations of Article XI.”8 These constitutional limitations are codified\n\n\n       6\n             Kodiak Island Borough v.

Mahoney, we considered the circumstances under which a municipal clerk\nmay deny a petition as unconstitutional under controlling authority.12 Rejecting the\nBorough’s argument that a clerk may not certify an application for an initiative unless\nthe clerk can conclude unequivocally that the proposed ordinance will be enforceable as\na matter of law, we held that a clerk must presume an initiative to be constitutional absent\nclear authority establishing otherwise, and “may only reject on substantive grounds a\n\n\n       8\n              (...continued)\npower serves as a check on other branches of government, such as legislative power to\ndefine courts’ jurisdiction or override judicial rules.” Id. at 717 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n       9\n              Id.\n       10\n              Carmony v.

Wade, the United States Supreme Court held that a state may not\nenact a broad ban on abortion because such a ban would violate a person’s constitutional\nright to privacy.15 DesJarlais contends that Roe v. Wade is not controlling precedent\nbecause “[l]iving preborn children have natural rights to life.” DesJarlais further argues\nthat we “should review the Superior Court’s factual finding that Roe v. Wade is\ncontrolling Federal Case law as clearly erroneous standard. Human life begins at the\nbeginning of biological development. Therefore, preborn children have natural rights\nsecured by the Alaska Constitution Article 1 Section 1.” DesJarlais thus implicitly\nargues 16 that 10NRTL is not “clearly unconstitutional” because Roe v.

Wade and this\ncourt’s interpretation of the privacy clause of the Alaska Constitution, such a law would\nbe “clearly contrary to controlling constitutional precedent.” The State responds to\nDesJarlais’s contention that Roe v. Wade is not controlling authority by arguing,\n“Although there is always a possibility that courts will reconsider their past constitutional\nrulings, the lieutenant governor’s decision not to certify an initiative must be based on\nthe precedent that currently controls, not on speculation about whether that precedent\nwill be overturned.”\n              In granting the State’s motion for summary judgment, the superior court\nfound, “While not stating explicitly that the bill is meant to prevent abortions, the\nlanguage of the ‘Natural Right to Life Initiative,’ considered with statements DesJarlais\nmade in the application, indicates that the purpose of the proposed bill is to ban abortion\nin most cases.” The superior court, relying on Roe v. Wade and our decision in Valley\nHospital Association, Inc. v. Mat-Su Coalition for Choice,17 concluded that “[a] law\nforbidding abortion is ‘clearly unconstitutional’ under controlling U.S. Supreme Court\nand Alaska Supreme Court precedent. . . . Given these longstanding, controlling\nprecedents — which cannot be ignored by either the Office of the Lieutenant Governor\nor this Court — DesJarlais’ proposed bill is ‘clearly unconstitutional.’ ”\n              10NRTL does not explicitly state that it is intended to ban abortion, but it\nprovides that “the natural right to life and body of the unborn child supercedes the\nstatutory right of the mother to consent to the injury or death of her unborn child.” It\nexcepts only life-threatening situations, in which case “the law of necessity shall dictate\nbetween the life of the mother and her child.” DesJarlais further explained “the intent\n\n\n       17\n              </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1125379\"><a href=\"/opinion/1125379/valley-hosp-assn-v-mat-su-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Alaska 1997).\n\n                                            -8-                                        6777\n\fof the Law of Necessity” in his letter to the lieutenant governor requesting initiative\napproval:\n             The Law of Necessity means that in life threatening situations\n             any act(s) done with the best interests to preserve the life of\n             the mother and her child would be protected. For example a\n             firefighter, involved in [a] car accident, may assess that there\n             is such a case where both the life of the mother and her child\n             a [sic] certain to be lost unless something is done. If a\n             prosecution for the loss of life took place regarding the\n             actions taken under these circumstances then they would be\n             protected upon proof before a jury that the actions were done\n             to prevent the loss of life of both the mother and her unborn\n             child.\n             Controlling United States Supreme Court precedent establishes that a broad\nban on abortion would be “clearly unconstitutional.”18 In Roe v. Wade, the Court\nconsidered the constitutionality of Texas criminal abortion statutes that prohibited\nabortion at any stage of pregnancy except where necessary to save the life of the\nmother.19 The Court held that, although a woman’s right to an abortion is not absolute\nand must be considered against compelling state interests, a broad ban on abortion\nviolates a woman’s constitutional right to privacy: “[A] state criminal abortion statute\n. . . that excepts from criminality only a life-saving procedure on behalf of the mother,\nwithout regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests\ninvolved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourth Amendment.”20\n\n\n      18\n              See Roe, 410 U.S. at 164 (holding unconstitutional Texas criminal abortion\nstatutes prohibiting abortion at any stage of pregnancy except where necessary to save\nmother’s life).\n      19\n             Id. at 117-18.\n      20\n             Id. at 164.

Casey, 505 U.S.\n                                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                           -9-                                     6777\n\n\f              DesJarlais’s proposed bill would preclude abortion to at least the same\nextent as the Texas criminal statutes at issue in Roe v. Wade. The Texas statutes\nprovided exceptions for abortions where the mother’s life was threatened,21 whereas\nDesJarlais’s initiative would permit abortion only where dictated by “the law of\nnecessity,” in which case a defendant would still be subject to criminal prosecution.\nBecause DesJarlais’s initiative would prohibit abortion to an extent that the United States\nSupreme Court has deemed unconstitutional, it is “clearly unconstitutional” under\ncontrolling authority.\n       B.     The State Is Not Legally Obligated To Outlaw Abortion.\n              Relying on article I, section 1 of the Alaska Constitution, DesJarlais argues\nthat “the State of Alaska is Constitutionally bound to preserve life.” DesJarlais argues\nthat because human life begins at the beginning of biological development, “preborn\nchildren have natural rights secured by the Alaska Constitution Article 1 Section 1.” He\nthus implicitly argues that because “preborn children” are protected under the Alaska\nConstitution, the State is legally obligated to outlaw abortion.\n              The State responds that “DesJarlais’ arguments that various provisions of\nstate and federal law require the state to ban abortion are precluded by . . . controlling\ncaselaw . . . . [B]oth the U.S. Supreme Court and this Court have held that the federal\n\n\n\n       20\n               (...continued)\n833 (1992), a plurality of the Court adopted a different test than the “compelling state\ninterest” test employed in Roe, holding that a state may regulate abortions so long as the\nregulation does not impose an “undue burden” on the woman’s ability to decide to have\nan abortion. Id. at 874. However, the Court reaffirmed the central holding of Roe:\n“Regardless of whether exceptions are made for particular circumstances, a State may\nnot prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy\nbefore viability.” Id. at 875.\n       21\n              Roe, 410 U.S. at 117-18.\n\n                                           -10-                                      6777\n\n\fand state constitutions prohibit states from banning abortion.” The State thus argues that\n“the lieutenant governor . . . cannot have violated any state or federal law by failing to\nban abortion,” and summary judgment was properly granted.\n              Article I, section 1 of the Alaska Constitution provides:\n              This constitution is dedicated to the principles that all persons\n              have a natural right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness,\n              and the enjoyment of the rewards of their own industry; that\n              all persons are equal and entitled to equal rights,\n              opportunities, and protection under the law; and that all\n              persons have corresponding obligations to the people and to\n              the State.\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\nprovides its own protections to “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States,\nand subject to the jurisdiction thereof.”22\n              In Roe v. Wade, the United States Supreme Court expressly held that “the\nword ‘person,’ as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn.”23\nThus, even if the State has a constitutional duty to protect all persons’ natural right to\nlife, as DesJarlais asserts, this duty does not extend to the unborn under controlling\nfederal law. Furthermore, the Alaska Constitution cannot guarantee limitless protections\nto the unborn because Roe v. Wade precludes all states from guaranteeing protections to\n\n\n\n\n       22\n              U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.\n       23\n               410 U.S. at 158. DesJarlais argues that “[t]he Justices in Roe v. Wade stated\nthat life begins at conception (beginning of biological development).” But contrary to\nDesJarlais’s argument, Roe v. Wade does not state that life begins at conception. The\nCourt chose not to “resolve the difficult question of when life begins,” concluding that\nthe judiciary, “at this point in the development of man’s knowledge, is not in a position\nto speculate as to the answer.” Id. at 159.\n\n                                              -11-                                    6777\n\n\fthe unborn that would ultimately result in a broad ban on abortion.24\n             DesJarlais looks to other jurisdictions for support, arguing that “the U.S.\n8th Circuit Court Ruled that preborn children are alive in [Planned Parenthood\nMinnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota v. Rounds.]”25 We are not bound by the Eighth\nCircuit’s decision; rather, we are bound by controlling United States Supreme Court\nprecedent and Alaska Supreme Court precedent.26\n             DesJarlais additionally references the United States Constitution, the Bible,\nthe Declaration of Independence, maxims of law, the Nuremberg Trials, various Alaska\nstatutes and rules of procedure, and various dictionaries, apparently in support of his\nargument that the State should outlaw abortion. The State correctly responds that many\nof the sources cited by DesJarlais “cannot create cognizable legal claims.”\n             DesJarlais’s argument also fails to recognize that we are governed by\npositive constitutional law.27 We are bound to follow the text, structure, and binding\n\n\n\n\n      24\n             Id. at 164-65.\n      25\n             </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1189321\"><a href=\"/opinion/1189321/planned-parent-mn-n-dakota-s-dakota-v-rounds/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 2008) (en banc).\n      26\n              See Roe, 410 U.S. at 164-65; Valley Hosp.
