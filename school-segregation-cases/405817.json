At issue in this appeal\n\nis whether amounts owing by a debtor hospital under Massachusetts\n\ngeneral law, chapter 118G, section 18, to a state fund known as the\n\nCommonwealth's Uncompensated Care Pool are properly considered to\n\nbe \"excise taxes\" enjoying priority in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 507(a)(8)(e).\n\n            Appellant, Boston Regional Medical Center, (\"BRMC or\n\ndebtor\")   filed       a    voluntary     petition      for    reorganization        under\n\nChapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy\n\nCourt    for     the       District      of    Massachusetts.            Appellee,     the\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, by its Division of Health Care\n\nFinance and Policy (\"HCFP\"), filed a proof of claim.                                 After\n\nresolving a disagreement over the dollar amount, appellee finally\n\nasserted a priority of claim for $1,702,714, a sum representing\n\nappellant's unpaid prepetition obligations as an acute hospital\n\nunder    Mass.   Gen.       Laws   ch.    118G,     §   18    to   the   Commonwealth's\n\nUncompensated Care Pool (the \"Pool\").1                  While the debtor agreed to\n\n\n     1\n      Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, § 18 was added by 1996 Mass. Acts\nch. 151, § 275, which repealed and replaced an earlier and\nsubstantially identical version of the same law, Mass. Gen. Laws\nch. 118F, § 15.    The debt at issue relates to the years 1996\nthrough 1999, so the earlier version of the statute is not\npertinent. Likewise, the numerous amendments to section 18 in the\nyear 1996 and after do not affect our analysis. 1996 Mass. Acts\nch. 203, § 18; 1997 Mass. Acts ch. 47, § 14; 1997 Mass. Acts ch.\n170, § 27; 1998 Mass. Acts ch. 319, § 9; 1998 Mass. Acts ch. 463,\n§ 100; 2001 Mass. Acts ch. 177, § 29; 2003 Mass. Acts ch. 26, §§\n353 to 359. As the parties have stipulated to the facts pertinent\nto the operation of the statute, we need refer only to the\nstipulation, not to the particular statutes themselves.\n\n                                              -2-\n\fthe dollar amount of the claim, it disputed appellee's contention\n\nthat the claim was entitled to priority as an \"excise tax\" under\n\nsection 507(a)(8)(E) of the Bankruptcy Code. Determining the claim\n\nwas for an excise tax, the bankruptcy court overruled appellant's\n\nobjection and granted priority to the claim.            In re Boston Reg'l\n\nMed. Ctr., 264 B.R. 222, 229-30 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2001) (\"BRMC II\").\n\nAppellant appealed, and the district court affirmed the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's   judgment,   stating    its   reasons     in   the   course    of   an\n\nunpublished bench ruling.       We affirm the district court.\n\n                                   Facts\n\n           The case was submitted on stipulated facts, the substance\n\nof which are as follows.\n\n           Prior to filing its Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition,\n\nappellant, BRMC, owned and operated a 195-bed private, acute\n\nhospital in Stoneham, Massachusetts.         As an acute hospital2 within\n\nMassachusetts,   BRMC   was     required      by   Massachusetts       law   to\n\nparticipate in the Pool (Pool).3           The Pool, administered by the\n\nState's Division of Health Care Finance and Policy, is a fund from\n\n\n     2\n      \"Acute hospital\" is defined as \"the teaching hospital of the\nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School and any hospital\nlicensed under section fifty-one of chapter one hundred and eleven\nand which contains a majority of medical-surgical, pediatric,\nobstetric, and maternity beds, as defined by the department of\npublic health.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, § 1.\n     3\n      To maintain their licenses, every Massachusetts acute\nhospital must pay or credit to the Pool such as the law requires.\nSee In re Ludlow Hosp. Soc'y, Inc., 216 B.R. 312, 315 (Bankr. D.\nMass. 1997).\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwhich Massachusetts hospitals are paid or credited for the free\n\nhealth care they furnish to patients who do not have health\n\ninsurance or cannot otherwise pay for hospital care.             Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws. ch. 118G, §§ 18(h) and (k).            The Pool's stated statutory\n\npurpose is \"to provide access to health care for low income\n\nuninsured and underinsured residents of the Commonwealth.\"4               Id.\n\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has stated, in respect to\n\nan earlier version of the Pool law, that the Pool's purpose is \"'to\n\nmore       equitably   distribute   the   burden   of   uncompensated   acute\n\nhospital services across all acute hospitals.'\"            Gen. Hosp. Corp.,\n\nv. Rate Setting Comm'n, 552 N.E.2d 113, 114 (Mass. 1990) (quoting\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 6A, § 75).\n\n               Pool funding comes both from the mandatory assessments\n\nmade against each acute hospital based on its \"private sector\n\ncharges,\" infra, and from other governmental funds and assessments.\n\nThe amounts collected by the Pool are segregated for its own\n\npurposes and are not used to fund other governmental programs or\n\notherwise to defray the costs of state government.\n\n\n       4\n      This quoted language appears in the version of § 18 as\namended by 1997 Mass. Acts ch. 47, § 14, an emergency act, approved\nJuly 11, 1997, and by 1997 Mass. Acts ch. 47, § 37, made effective\nOct. 1, 1997. This portion of § 18 was again amended by 2003 Mass.\nActs ch. 26, § 353, an emergency act, approved June 30, 2003, and\nby 2003 Mass. Acts ch. 26, § 715 made effective July 1, 2003, in\nsubsec. (a), which substituted \"is to reimburse hospitals and\ncommunity health centers for care provided to low-income, uninsured\nand underinsured residents of the commonwealth\" for \"shall be to\nprovide access to health care for low income uninsured and\nunderinsured residents of the commonwealth\".\n\n                                      -4-\n\f                 Section 18 provides for the collection and distribution\n\nof Pool funds among the hospitals.                    According to section 18(e), a\n\nhospital's liability to the Pool is proportional to the amount of\n\notherwise uncompensated care each hospital provides.                            Liability to\n\nthe Pool (i.e., the assessment based on its private sector charges)\n\n\"shall equal the product of (1) the ratio of its private sector\n\ncharges to all acute hospitals' private sector charges; and (2) the\n\nprivate         sector   liability       to    the        uncompensated      care    Pool      as\n\ndetermined by law . . . .\"5                    In order to determine the debtor\n\nhospital's        individual   liability             to    the    Pool,   the     HCFP    must,\n\ntherefore, first determine the amount of private sector charges for\n\nall hospitals in Massachusetts.                       \"Private sector charges\" is\n\ndefined as a hospital's gross patient service revenue, less the\n\namount of gross patient service revenue that is attributable to\n\nMedicare, Medicaid and other \"publicly aided patients, free care\n\nand       bad     debt.\"       Mass.          Gen.        Laws     ch.    118G,      §    1.\n\n                 In   calculating    a    hospital's             liability   to     the   Pool,\n\ncertain credits are provided.                 A hospital's assessed liability to\n\nthe Pool is offset against the amount owed by the Pool to the\n\n\n\n      5\n      This quoted language appears in the version of § 18 as\namended by 1997 Mass. Acts ch. 47, § 14, an emergency act, approved\nJuly 11, 1997, and by 1997 Mass. Acts ch. 47, § 37, which went into\neffect on July 11, 1997 and Oct. 1, 1997, respectively. Prior to\nthese amendments, the language was as follows, \"A hospital's\nliability to the pool shall equal the product of: (a) the ratio of\nits private sector charges; and (b) the private sector liability to\nthe uncompensated care pool as determined by the general court.\"\n\n                                              -5-\n\fhospital for uncompensated care during the same period, thus\n\nresulting   in   either   a   net   liability   to   the   Pool   or   a   net\n\ndistribution from the Pool.         Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, § 18(d).\n\nThe Pool, therefore, charges the hospitals' collective private\n\nsector revenue to pay for the hospitals' collective burden of\n\nuncompensated care, resulting, at bottom, in a net transfer of\n\nrevenue from those hospitals that provide less uncompensated care\n\n(as a proportion of the hospital's total patient service charges)\n\nto those that provide more.      Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, §§ 18(d) and\n\n18(h).   To the extent a hospital receives reimbursement for free\n\ncare directly from Medicare, Medicaid or another source other than\n\nthe Pool, the amount owed by all other hospitals is reduced because\n\nthe amount of funding required from the Pool is reduced.\n\n            Furthermore, \"disproportionate share hospitals\" -- which\n\nare hospitals that have \"a payer mix where a minimum of sixty-three\n\npercent of the acute hospital's gross patient service revenue is\n\nattributable to [certain government payments] and free care\" -- and\n\n\"non-disproportionate share hospitals\" -- which do not have that\n\npayer mix -- receive different treatment under section 18.             Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 118, § 1.       In the event that the Pool does not have\n\nsufficient funds to reimburse all hospitals for all of the free\n\ncare provided, the amount paid from the Pool is weighted towards\n\ndisproportionate share hospitals.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f             Pursuant to section 18, BRMC owes appellee a total of\n\n$1,702,714, representing the total amount due to the Pool for the\n\nfollowing fiscal years:\n\n             a.     1996 - $1,580,506\n\n             b.     1997 - $     60,639\n\n             c.     1998 - $    (77,744) credit\n\n             d.     1999 - $    139,313\n\n             The bankruptcy court concluded that the foregoing total\n\nPool claim was entitled to priority as an excise tax, thus giving\n\nrise to the single issue presented in the current appeal.            BRMC II,\n\n264 B.R. at 229-30.\n\n              Present Contentions and the Opinions Below\n\n             As it did below, the appellant now argues that the claim\n\nfor the Pool assessment owed by BRMC is not for an \"excise tax,\"\n\nthus   not   entitled    to   priority,   under   §   507(a)(8)(E)    of   the\n\nBankruptcy Code.        In BRMC's view, the bankruptcy and district\n\ncourts failed to engage in an adequate \"functional analysis\" of the\n\nnature of the statutory assessment underlying the Pool claim. BRMC\n\ncontends that the Pool statute is in form and function merely a\n\nrisk sharing plan imposed on acute hospitals -- a plan, that,\n\ninstead of being a tax, is really only a regulatory fee imposed for\n\nthe privilege of operating an acute hospital in Massachusetts.\n\n             In response, appellee argues that the mandatory exaction\n\nplaced by Massachusetts law upon the state's acute hospitals is a\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\ftax, having been legislatively established to raise monies to\n\nadvance the public purpose of promoting continued access to acute\n\nhospital    services      by   low-income        uninsured    and    underinsured\n\nresidents of Massachusetts.\n\n            In ruling that the Pool assessment is a tax, not a fee,\n\nthe bankruptcy court similarly laid particular emphasis upon the\n\nexaction's public purpose -- the promotion of hospital access to\n\nlow-income uninsured and underinsured residents of Massachusetts.\n\nBRMC II, 264 B.R. at 225.             That, coupled with its involuntary\n\ncharacter   and     its   other     functional     attributes,      was    found   to\n\ndifferentiate it from a regulatory fee.                Id. at 225-30.\n\n            In affirming the bankruptcy court's opinion, the district\n\ncourt stated from the bench that the bankruptcy court's reasoning\n\nwas persuasive with \"one possible exception.\"                The court said the\n\nmere fact that the Pool exaction was paid in order to serve the\n\npublic welfare would not necessarily demonstrate it was an excise\n\ntax.      Almost    everything      paid    to   the    government,       the   court\n\nsuggested, is intended for a public purpose.                 Here, however, the\n\ncourt found the exaction to be targeted specifically at paying for\n\nmedical    care    for    members    of    the   public    unable    to    pay     for\n\nthemselves.       Unlike the case of a driver's license or other fee,\n\nthe money is not collected by the government simply to confer a\n\nbenefit on the payer or to pay itself for a government service\n\nrendered to the payer.            \"Functionally and under the so-called\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fSuburban   factors,   this   is    a   tax,\"   the   district   court   said.\n\nFurther, the tax is an excise, the court continued, citing a\n\ndefinition found in Black's Law Dictionary.6\n\n                                  Discussion\n\n           At issue is whether the assessments for the Uncompensated\n\nCare Pool imposed upon appellant under state law constitute \"excise\n\ntaxes\" and, therefore, are entitled to priority under section\n\n507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.         This is a federal question.       City\n\nof New York v. Feiring, 313 U.S. 283, 285 (1941); State of New\n\nJersey v. Anderson, 203 U.S. 483, 491 (1906).             The parties have\n\nstipulated to the facts, leaving only the application of the\n\nstatute, a matter we examine on appeal de novo.            Commonwealth of\n\nMass.

Ctr., Inc.), 291 F.3d 111, 119 (2002)\n\n(\"BRMC I\").\n\n           Provisions that grant priority in bankruptcy are to be\n\nnarrowly construed.     See Cramer v. Mammoth Mart, Inc. (In re\n\nMammoth Mart, Inc.),    536 F.2d 950, 953 (1st Cir. 1976) (stating,\n\n\"We begin with the premise that the theme of the Bankruptcy Act is\n\n\n\n     6\n      The district court stated:\n     Black's Law Dictionary, the 7th edition, page 585,\n     defines an excise tax as a tax imposed on the\n     manufacture, sale, or use of goods, or on an occupation\n     or activity. Since the tax here is a tax that is levied\n     as a result of operating the hospital and measured by a\n     hospital's share of industry's revenues, it is an excise\n     tax, I find, as opposed to a tax of some other sort.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f'equality of distribution.'

JWD, Inc. (In re Northwest Fin. Express, Inc.),\n\n950 F.2d 561, 563 (8th Cir. 1991).\n\n          Section   507(a)   sets    forth     in   descending    order      nine\n\ncategories of priority claims.             Appellee's claim for priority\n\nstatus is stipulated to be based solely upon its being an \"excise\n\ntax\" under § 507(a)(8)(E), the eighth category.                 The relevant\n\nlanguage reads as follows:\n\n          § 507.      Priorities.\n          (a) The following expenses and claims have\n          priority in the following order:\n          . . .\n          (8) Eighth, allowed unsecured claims of\n          governmental units, only to the extent that\n          such claims are for --\n          . . .\n          (E) an excise tax on --\n          (i) a transaction occurring before the date of\n          the filing of the petition for which a return,\n          if required, is last due, under applicable law\n          or under any extension, after three years\n          before the date of the filing of the petition;\n          or\n          (ii) if a return is not required, a\n          transaction occurring during the three years\n          immediately preceding the date of the filing\n          of the petition;\n\nThe parties do not question that appellee is a governmental unit,\n\nthat it holds an unsecured claim, that the claim relates only to\n\ntransactions   occurring   before    the     date   of   the   filing   of    the\n\npetition, and that the three-year limitation does not bar the\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fclaim.      In dispute is only whether the claim is for an \"excise\n\ntax.\"      Unless so, the claim is without priority.\n\n              The Bankruptcy Code does not define \"excise tax,\" nor is\n\nthe legislative history informative on what the term means.               BRMC\n\nI,   291    F.3d   at   120.     We   turn,   therefore,   to   the   relevant\n\ninterpretive case law.         See BRMC I, 291 F.3d at 120 (citing United\n\nStates v.

The discussion in the cases has mostly concerned\n\nthe meaning of the term \"tax,\" with little attention paid to the\n\nterm \"excise.\"      See, e.g., CF & I, 518 U.S. at 224-26 (relying on\n\nprecedent concerning definition of \"tax\" and concluding that the\n\nobligation at issue was a \"penalty\" rather than a \"tax\" and,\n\ntherefore, that the obligation was not entitled to priority as an\n\n\"excise tax\"); Workers' Comp. Trust Fund v. Saunders, 234 B.R. 555,\n\n560 n.8 (D. Mass. 1999); In re Park, 212 B.R. 430, 434 (D. Mass.\n\n1997) (noting that courts do not often engage in analysis of the\n\n\"excise\" portion of the phrase \"excise tax\" once an exaction has\n\nbeen determined to be a \"tax\").\n\n             The Supreme Court has defined taxes as \"pecuniary burdens\n\nlaid upon individuals or their property, regardless of their\n\nconsent, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of government or\n\nof undertakings authorized by it.\"            Feiring, 313 U.S. at 285-88;\n\nsee also Anderson, 203 U.S. at 492; BRMC I, 291 F.3d at 120.              This\n\ndefinition is sometimes called the \"Feiring-Anderson\" standard. CF\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f& I, 518 U.S. at 222 n.6.   The Court has added that courts should\n\nlook beyond the statutory label of an exaction and evaluate its\n\n\"actual effects\" to determine whether it functions as either a tax\n\nor else as some different kind of obligation, like a debt, fee, or\n\npenalty.   CF & I, 518 U.S. at 221, 224-25; see also BRMC I, 291\n\nF.3d at 120.\n\n           The lower courts have often struggled in applying the\n\nFeiring-Anderson analysis to debts in a bankruptcy setting.    Some\n\ncourts have asked whether the tax characteristics of a state-\n\nimposed exaction outweigh its non-tax characteristics.        In re\n\nChateaugay Corp., 153 B.R. 632, 641 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1993); Bell v.\n\nBrown (In re Payne), 27 B.R. 809, 817 (Bankr. D. Kan. 1983).\n\nOthers have asked whether, regardless of non-tax characteristics,\n\nthere are sufficient tax attributes to call the exaction a tax.\n\nSee, e.g., Waldo v. State of Montana Dept. of Labor and Industry\n\nUninsured Employers Fund (In re Waldo), 186 B.R. 118, 125 (Bankr.\n\nD. Montana) (1995) (stating, \"[t]herefore since all elements of the\n\n[list of tax characteristics] are fully satisfied by the UEF's\n\nclaim against Debtor, Debtor's obligation is in the nature of a tax\n\nfor purposes of the Bankruptcy Code, specifically 11 U.S.C. §\n\n507(a)(7)(E).\").   Some courts have also sought to give particular\n\nand separate weight to the Bankruptcy Code's principle of equal\n\ndistribution of the debtor's estate.    See, e.g., Workers' Comp.\n\nTrust Fund v. Saunders, 234 B.R. 555, 565-67 (D. Mass. 1999); see\n\n\n                               -12-\n\falso Begier v. Internal Revenue Service, 496 U.S. 53, 58 (1990)\n\n(stating \"Equality of distribution among creditors is a central\n\npolicy of the Bankruptcy Code.\").\n\n            Given    the    difficulty        of    applying   Feiring-Anderson's\n\ngeneral   definition       of   a    tax    to     the   unusual   state   exactions\n\nsometimes   encountered         in   a     bankruptcy     context,   \"courts    have\n\nformulated additional criteria for determining when a governmental\n\nclaim is entitled to priority treatment.\"                 In re United Healthcare\n\nSys., Inc., 282 B.R. 330, 335 (Bankr. D. N.J. 2002).                        Foremost\n\namong these has been the multi-factored test developed in the Ninth\n\nand Sixth Circuits known as the Lorber/Suburban II analysis.\n\nCounty Sanitation v. Lorber Indus. of California, Inc. (In re\n\nLorber Indus. of California, Inc.), 675 F.2d 1062, 1066 (9th Cir.\n\n1982); Ohio Bureau of Workers' Comp. v. Yoder (In re Suburban Motor\n\nFreight, Inc.), 36 F.3d 484, 488 (6th Cir. 1994) (\"Suburban II\").\n\nThe bankruptcy court below relied heavily upon a Massachusetts\n\nbankruptcy decision that applied Lorber/Suburban II to the Pool\n\nexaction here.      BRMC II, 264 B.R. at 226 (citing In re Ludlow Hosp.\n\nSoc'y, Inc., 216 B.R. at 318-20).                    The district court seemed\n\nlargely content with that approach.\n\n            In Lorber, the Ninth Circuit held that, to qualify as a\n\ntax, an exaction must be:             (1) an involuntary pecuniary burden,\n\nregardless of name, laid upon individuals or property; (2) imposed\n\nby, or under authority of the legislature; (3) for public purposes,\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fincluding the purposes of defraying expenses of government or\n\nundertakings authorized by it; and (4) under the police or taxing\n\npower of the state.      Lorber, 675 F.2d at 1066.        In Suburban II, the\n\nSixth Circuit expressed concern over the adequacy and possible one-\n\nsidedness of Lorber's \"public purpose\" prong, and it added two\n\nadditional factors of its own, namely (5) whether the exaction is\n\nuniversally applied to all similarly situated entities and (6)\n\nwhether the granting of priority status to a governmental claimant\n\nwould prejudice private creditors with like claims.             Suburban II,\n\n36 F.3d at 488-89; see also BRMC I, 291 F.3d at 121 n.10 (sharing\n\nSuburban II court's concern that Lorber, by itself, was \"incomplete\n\nand   one-sided,   and    may   lead    to    incorrect   results.\")   (citing\n\nSuburban II, 36 F.3d at 488-89; Indus. Comm'n v. Camilli (In re\n\nCamilli), 94 F.3d 1330, 1333-34 (9th Cir. 1996) (holding the\n\nSuburban cases consistent with Lorber and following the Sixth\n\nCircuit's reasoning)).\n\n           Debtor contends the Supreme Court implicitly rejected the\n\nLorber/Suburban II standard in United States v. Reorganized CF & I\n\nFabricators of Utah, Inc., a case decided after the Ninth and Sixth\n\nCircuits' decisions in Lorber and Suburban II.               In CF & I, the\n\nCourt made no mention of Lorber or Suburban II.                   Rather, it\n\nemphasized the \"continuing vitality of the cases in the Feiring\n\nline.\"   CF & I, 518 U.S. at 222.              But Lorber and Suburban II\n\nundertook to apply the principles stated in the Feiring line, and\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fwe see nothing in CF & I that renders those circuit precedents                      no\n\nlonger useful constructs.           We faced this issue recently in BRMC I,\n\nholding that Lorber and the Suburban cases remained persuasive\n\nafter CF & I.       We said in BRMC I:\n\n             The BAP treated Anderson and [Feiring] on the\n             one hand, and Lorber and the two Suburban\n             cases on the other, as developing different\n             and apparently mutually exclusive tests. It\n             then concluded that the Supreme Court had\n             chosen the former test rather than the latter\n             in CF & I.      We consider Lorber and the\n             Suburban cases to be refinements of the law\n             generated in Anderson and Feiring, which\n             remain persuasive to although not binding on\n             this court after CF & I.\n\nBRMC   I,    291    F.3d    at   121    n.10      (citations     omitted).         The\n\nLorber/Suburban II approach therefore remains an available tool of\n\nanalysis,     although,     of   course,    subject      at    all   times    to   the\n\noverarching authority of Feiring and Anderson. See, e.g., San Juan\n\nCellular v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Puerto Rico, 967 F.2d 683, 684-\n\n687 (1st Cir. 1992) (utilizing an approach that approximated the\n\nfirst three prongs of Lorber); In re Ludlow Hosp. Soc'y, Inc., 216\n\nB.R. at 319 (stating, \"This Court disagrees with the Trustee's\n\nassertion that [San Juan Cellular] represents an approach different\n\nfrom what appears to be a well-settled line of cases commencing\n\nwith Feiring.       Notwithstanding the fact that San Juan Cellular was\n\ndecided     under   the    Tax   Injunction       Act,   we   find   the     thoughts\n\nexpressed     by     the    panel      in   San     Juan      Cellular     virtually\n\nindistinguishable from those expressed by the Ninth and Sixth\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fCircuits   in    Lorber    and     Suburban   II,    both   decided    under       the\n\nBankruptcy Code.\").        Many other courts have found Lorber/Suburban\n\nII to be consistent with, and useful in applying, the controlling\n\nFeiring-Anderson rationale.          See In re Cassidy, 983 F.2d 161, 163\n\n(10th   Cir.    1992);    Indus.    Comm'n    of    Ariz.   v.    Camilli    (In    re\n\nCamilli), 94 F.3d 1330, 1331-32 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519\n\nU.S. 1113 (1997); In re Park, 212 B.R. 430, 433-34 (Bankr. D. Mass.\n\n1997); Sacred Heart Hosp. v. Penn. Dep't of Labor and Indus. (In re\n\nSacred Heart Hosp.), 209 B.R. 650, 654-58 (E.D. Pa. 1997); In re\n\nChateaugay Corp., 177 B.R. at 637-38; In re S.N.A. Nut Co., 188\n\nB.R. 392, 393-94 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1995).\n\n           Accordingly, in considering the term \"tax\" here, we avail\n\nourselves of the analytical approach set out in Lorber/Suburban II.\n\nIn doing so, we find ourselves in essential agreement with the\n\nsimilar application of Lorber/Suburban II in In re Ludlow Hosp.\n\nSoc'y, Inc., as adopted by the bankruptcy court below.                      BRMC II,\n\n264 B.R. at 226 (citing In re Ludlow Hosp. Soc'y, Inc., 216 B.R. at\n\n318-20).\n\n           1.    Involuntary Burden\n\n           We ask first whether the Pool exaction was an involuntary\n\npecuniary burden.         Lorber, 675 F.2d at 1066.              The Lorber court\n\nexplained that an \"involuntary pecuniary burden\" was a \"non-\n\ncontractual obligation imposed by state statute upon taxpayers who\n\nhad not consented to its imposition.\"              Id. (citing Dungan v. Dept.\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fof Agric., State of Calif., 332 F.2d 793 (9th Cir. 1964), aff'g In\n\nre Farmers Frozen Food Co., 221 F. Supp. 385 (N.D. Cal. 1963)).\n\nThe exaction here was imposed by statute; it was neither consented\n\nto, nor part of a contract.     It was thus an involuntary pecuniary\n\nburden.\n\n           Appellant argues that the assessment was nonetheless\n\nvoluntary because each acute hospital could to some degree regulate\n\nits obligation to the Pool by choosing to provide more or less free\n\ncare. However, acute hospitals within the ambit of Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 118G, § 18 have no legal option but to pay or credit such\n\nassessments as are due. And even if appellant enlarged the quantum\n\nof free care it provided, it could not be certain to avoid\n\nliability.   An acute hospital's liability is based, in part, upon\n\nthe amount of free care that all other acute hospitals in the state\n\nhave provided for that same year -- an unpredictable amount.             The\n\nonly way appellant could be certain to avoid sharing in the burdens\n\nof the Pool would be to cease all acute care operations.          See In re\n\nSuburban   Motor   Freight,   156   B.R.   790,   792   (S.D.   Ohio   1992)\n\n(concluding that the statute insurance scheme in favor of private\n\ninsurance was involuntary since employers were not permitted to opt\n\nout and rejecting argument that scheme was voluntary because\n\nemployers could choose not to be under it by refusing to conduct\n\nbusiness in the state).       By appellant's rationale, the federal\n\nincome tax would not qualify as a \"tax\" because the taxpayer may\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fvoluntarily minimize his or her tax liability by earning less\n\nincome or by taking advantage of deductions.          See, e.g., In re\n\nSacred Heart Hosp., 212 B.R. at 474 (stating, \"All taxes may be\n\navoided by a 'choice' of the taxpayer\").\n\n           2.    Exaction Imposed Under State's Authority\n\n           Secondly, there is no dispute the Pool exaction is\n\nimposed under the authority of the Massachusetts legislature.\n\nLorber, 675 F.2d at 1066.\n\n           3.    Exaction Was For A Public Purpose\n\n           Thirdly, the Pool exaction is for a public purpose, i.e.\n\nfor the defraying of expenses or undertakings of a type commonly\n\nassumed by the government -- namely, those providing free health\n\ncare to persons without the resources to pay for it.         Lorber, 675\n\nF.2d at 1066.    There is no correlation between what a hospital pays\n\nand the receipt in return of some particular service.        Rather, the\n\nhospital is obliged, based on an equitable formula, to help fund\n\nhospitals around the state that serve indigent members of the\n\npublic,   thus   enabling   Massachusetts   to   provide   free   care   to\n\nresidents.   Disproportionate share hospitals rely on Pool funds to\n\nremain in business.7        While acute hospitals are the exclusive\n\nrecipients of these funds, the amount each receives relates to the\n\n\n     7\n      While the Pool benefits disproportionate share hospitals by\nassisting with their reasonable financial requirements relative to\ncaring for indigent patients, the statutory formula does not allow\nhospitals to profit from Pool funds. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, §§\n1 & 18A.\n\n                                  -18-\n\famount of free public services each provides.         Under the statutory\n\nscheme, individual hospitals serve as conduits through which the\n\nPool channels funds to pay for the free care rendered to uninsured\n\nor underinsured patients.         This court stated in San Juan Cellular,\n\n967 F.2d at 685, that \"[c]ourts facing cases that lie in the middle\n\nof this spectrum have tended (sometimes with minor differences\n\nreflecting the different statutes at issue) to emphasize the\n\nrevenue's ultimate use, . . . .\"8           The \"ultimate use\" here is a\n\nvalid governmental purpose -- one specifically identified in the\n\nrelevant Massachusetts statute.         See Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 118G, §\n\n18.\n\n              Appellant argues that the exaction does not defray costs\n\nof the Commonwealth because the Pool merely spreads the cost of\n\ncare among the acute hospitals.        It further notes that the funds of\n\nthe Pool are segregated from other state revenues and not used to\n\nfund       other   governmental   operations   of   the   Commonwealth   of\n\nMassachusetts.       According to appellant, the exaction is merely to\n\ndefray costs and provide benefits to hospitals participating in the\n\nprogram rather than to the Commonwealth and the general public. In\n\n\n\n       8\n      It is true that \"all money collected by the Government goes\ntowards defraying its expenses, and is used for public purposes.\"\nYoder v. Ohio Bureau of Workers' Comp. (In re Suburban Motor\nFreight, Inc.), 998 F.2d 338, 341 (6th Cir. 1993). We need not be\nconcerned here, however, because the connection between the Pool\npayments and the recipient of free care is not tenuous -- the funds\nare given in direct relation to the amount of free care provided.\nMass. Gen. Laws. ch. 118G, §§ 1 &18A.\n\n                                     -19-\n\fsupport of this argument, appellant analogizes the Pool to the\n\nUnemployment Compensation Fund in BRMC I.                      We disagree.        In BRMC I,\n\nwe concluded that the fund scheme was not a tax because, among\n\nother reasons, \"The distinction between the payments required to\n\nsustain a government undertaking as a whole and those required\n\nmerely     to    compensate        for    the       costs   imposed      by   a   particular\n\nparticipant is significant.\"                   291 F.3d at 122.         Here the payments\n\nto   the   Pool       are    geared      to    sustain,     as   a     whole,     the   stated\n\ngovernmental undertaking of providing access to health care for\n\nlow-income        uninsured         and        underinsured           residents     of      the\n\nCommonwealth.          Accordingly, these costs are distinguishable from\n\nthe costs in BRMC I.\n\n                Nor     is   the      Pool       analogous       to     the     Unemployment\n\nCompensation Fund.           To be sure, the Pool operates as a sort of risk\n\nsharing plan, but that does not preclude it from satisfying the\n\npublic purpose requirement.                   See Williams v. Motley, 925 F.2d 741,\n\n745 (4th Cir. 1991) (pool of funds to be distributed among all of\n\nthe state's automobile insurers to compensate for uninsured drivers\n\nwas a tax, not a regulatory fee, because the pool's purpose was to\n\nbenefit the           general   public         by   reducing     the    overall     costs    of\n\nuninsured motorist insurance coverage).                           We have expressed a\n\nwillingness to declare such fund-type mechanisms \"taxes.\"                               See San\n\nJuan Cellular Tel. Co., 967 F.2d at 685 (stating, \"Or, [a tax] may\n\nserve such purposes indirectly by, for example, raising money\n\n\n                                               -20-\n\fplaced in a special fund to help defray the agency's regulation-\n\nrelated expenses.\").\n\n          4.   Pool Assessment Imposed Under Police Or Taxing Power\n\n          Fourthly, there is no dispute that the Pool assessment\n\nwas imposed pursuant to the Commonwealth's police or taxing power.\n\nLorber, 675 F.2d at 1066.\n\n          5.   Assessment Uniformly Applied To All\n\n          Fifthly, the Pool assessment is uniformly applied to all\n\nsimilarly situated entities.    Suburban II, 36 F.3d at 489.   The\n\ndebtor argues that since the Pool statute favors disproportionate\n\nshare hospitals, it is not uniformly applied.   It points out that\n\nhospitals providing a disproportionate amount of free care receive\n\nthe most benefit from the Pool.    For example, after years where\n\nthere is a deficiency in the Pool, those disproportionate share\n\nhospitals with the greatest proportional requirement for Pool\n\nincome have to pay less of a share into the Pool than do the other\n\nhospitals.     Also, in the event that the Pool does not have\n\nsufficient funds to reimburse all hospitals for all of the free\n\ncare provided, the amount paid from the Pool is weighted towards\n\ndisproportionate share hospitals. However, all acute hospitals are\n\nsubject to the same rules; all similarly situated hospitals are\n\ntreated alike.   See, e.g., Ludlow Hosp. Soc'y, Inc., 216 B.R. at\n\n320 (finding that Pool satisfied requirement that the assessment be\n\nuniversally applied to similarly situated entities because the\n\n\n                               -21-\n\fobligation to participate in the Pool is \"universally imposed on\n\nall   acute    hospitals      in   the   Commonwealth\").        Under   the    Pool\n\nassessment scheme, acute hospitals with the same financial profiles\n\nin any given year will have the same liability in the Pool.                 Boston\n\nReg'l Med. Ctr., 264 B.R. at 227.                Under debtor's reasoning, the\n\nfederal personal income tax, which treats people with different\n\nincomes differently, would not constitute a tax.                We conclude the\n\nexaction here is applied uniformly to similarly situated entities.\n\n              6.   No Prejudice To Private Creditors\n\n              Lastly, under the final Lorber/Suburban II factor, we\n\nconsider      if   granting    priority     to    the   Pool   assessment     would\n\nprejudice private creditors with like claims. Suburban II, 36 F.3d\n\nat 489.       The Suburban II court framed this sixth requirement\n\nbecause it was concerned that private actors who might, in some\n\ncases, perform the same function as the government would be given\n\ninferior priority.       Suburban II, 36 F.3d at 488 (stating \"If the\n\nState had an optional participation program, or allowed employers\n\nto purchase private liability insurance, it would be unfair and\n\nwithout statutory justification to call state-collected premiums\n\n'taxes' and put the Bureau ahead in line while leaving unpaid\n\nprivate insurers to languish along with the rest of the unsecured\n\ncreditors.\") (quoting Suburban I, 998 F.2d at 342) (emphasis\n\nsupplied) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\f              The bankruptcy court determined there were \"no private\n\ncreditors with claims sufficiently similar to [appellee's] who\n\nwould suffer any disadvantage by conferring priority treatment to\n\na Pool claim.\"      We agree.      Appellant points to no private creditor\n\nwith a role comparable to appellee's.                No private entity with\n\npower to require hospitals to contribute to a fund for the sake of\n\npreserving free care for the indigent has been identified.                  See\n\nCamilli, 94, F.3d at 1334.          Instead, appellant seeks to switch the\n\nargument to the purported lack of injury to appellee if it does not\n\nreceive priority as a creditor.          According to appellant, appellee\n\nstate agency (rather than the hospitals themselves) will suffer no\n\nloss in any event.         Supposedly this indicates the exaction is a\n\nregulatory fee.      This argument, however, ignores the loss to the\n\ngovernment's program, aimed at furnishing free hospital services to\n\nthe public, if the assessment is unpaid.             The argument, moreover,\n\nis beside the point; as it focuses on the purported lack of harm to\n\nthe government creditor rather than on whether granting priority to\n\nthe    Pool   assessment    will    prejudice    a   private   creditor.     As\n\nappellant's argument has nothing to do with the government's\n\nposition in relation to similarly situated private entities, it is\n\nnot germane.\n\n              We conclude that the Pool assessment satisfies all of the\n\nLorber/Suburban II criteria for a tax.           Appellant, however, argues\n\nthat    a   court   must   additionally       inquire   whether   the   non-tax\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fcharacteristics, particularly the regulatory fee characteristics,\n\nof the exaction outweigh the tax characteristics.                Since the\n\nLorber/Suburban II criteria were developed to subsume that inquiry,\n\nwe arguably need not entertain it.         But because the exercise is\n\nilluminating, we take it on, finding that it leads to the same\n\nresult as was reached under Lorber/Suburban II.\n\n            Regulatory fees have been defined as \"monies paid to the\n\ngovernment incident to a voluntary act that bestows a benefit on\n\nthe applicant, not shared by other members of society.\"          N. Dakota\n\nWorkers Comp. Bureau v. Voightman (In re Voightman), 239 B.R. 380,\n\n383 (8th Cir. 1999); see also Nat'l Cable Television Ass'n, Inc. v.\n\nUnited States, 415 U.S. 336, 340-41 (1974) (defining regulatory\n\nfees same way in non-bankruptcy context).       Similarly, in San Juan\n\nCellular, we approved of the approach utilized by other courts,\n\nwhich -- in distinguishing a tax from a regulatory fee -- focused\n\non the \"revenue's ultimate use, asking whether it provides a\n\ngeneral benefit to the public, of a sort often financed by a\n\ngeneral tax, or whether it provides a more narrow benefit[] to\n\nregulated companies or defray[s] the agency's cost of regulation.\"\n\n967 F.2d at 685.      The ultimate design and use of the exaction here\n\nare to help finance the provision of hospital care to people unable\n\nto   pay   for   it   themselves.    While   specialized   and    somewhat\n\nintricate, it finances a general benefit to the public of a kind\n\nthat could properly have been financed from more ordinary tax\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\frevenues.    Per contra, the Pool scheme is not aimed at bestowing a\n\nnarrow benefit upon the payer hospital, nor defraying the cost of\n\nregulation.    We conclude the exaction is a tax.\n\n            Appellant   makes    various   other   arguments   not   so   far\n\naddressed.    We briefly discuss some of them, finding none to have\n\nmerit.\n\n            Relying on BRMC I, appellant argues that since appellee,\n\nitself, does not have to pay any shortfall in the Pool, it is not\n\nan involuntary creditor.9       In BRMC I, we stated that \"[o]ne of the\n\nimportant reasons for giving special priority in bankruptcy to\n\ntaxes is that state and federal governments do not generally choose\n\ntheir tax debtors.\"     291 F.3d at 123.     Taxing authorities receive\n\npriority treatment because, inter alia, they are \"involuntary\n\ncreditor[s] of the debtor,\" who are unable to \"take security in\n\nadvance of the time that taxes become due.\"           Id.   In concluding\n\nthat the exaction in BRMC I was not a tax, we noted the law would\n\nhave allowed the Commonwealth to have required BRMC to post a\n\nsurety to secure its anticipated future liability to the fund at\n\n\n     9\n      If we are to understand appellant's argument as a claim that\nappellee is not a creditor, let alone an involuntary creditor, it\nnevertheless fails. Appellant has stipulated that it owes appellee\n$1,702,714. Accordingly, appellee is a creditor. 11 U.S.C. § 101\n(defining \"creditor,\" inter alia, as \"entity that has a claim\nagainst the debtor that arose at the time of or before the order\nfor relief concerning the debtor,\" and defining \"claim,\" inter\nalia, as a \"right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced\nto judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured,\nunmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or\nunsecured.\").\n\n                                    -25-\n\fissue.       Here,   however,   appellee     has   no   authority   to   require\n\nsecurity in advance.         Its remedies are ex post facto.         Upon non-\n\npayment by an acute hospital, appellee can only then either re-\n\ncalibrate the Pool in accordance with the statutory formula for the\n\nnext year or choose, for example, to refuse to renew the expired\n\nlicenses of a defaulting acute hospital.                The appellee cannot be\n\nsaid, therefore, to choose its debtors, nor is appellee other than\n\nan involuntary creditor.        Id.\n\n             On a different tack, appellant contends that for an\n\nexaction to be a tax, the statute must provide the government with\n\nan automatic lien to secure payment. The existence of an automatic\n\nlien provision was one of several attributes of a tax listed by the\n\nbankruptcy court in Park and Columbia Packing.                   However, the\n\nabsence of such a lien was not said to prevent an exaction from\n\nbeing    a   tax.    Here,    appellee   has   different     remedies    at   its\n\ndisposal, including the ability to offset payments due to the\n\ndefaulting hospital's Medicaid claims.             BRMC II, 264 B.R. at 225,\n\n228 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, § 18(g)).                     Appellant's\n\nargument in this regard seems inconsistent with our statement in\n\nBRMC I that the absence of pre-default security for payment would\n\nmilitate in favor of finding a priority claim.             BRMC I, 291 F.3d at\n\n123.\n\n             Appellant also argues that the amount of an exaction must\n\nbe fixed by statute in order to qualify as a tax and that, since\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fthe amount of the assessment here varies depending on the amount of\n\nfree care given by all acute hospitals, the exaction is not\n\nsufficiently fixed by statute. In support of this claim, appellant\n\nrelies solely on In re Freymiller Trucking, Inc..        There, the\n\nBankruptcy Court for the Western District of Oklahoma stated, \"I am\n\nunable to think of a 'tax' . . . that is not based on a percentage\n\nof something, be it income, sales, corporate capital, or the value\n\nof property, a gift or inheritance.\"      194 B.R. 914, 915 (Bankr.\n\nW.D. Okla. 1996).    In concluding that a tax assesses at a \"fixed\n\nrate,\" the Freymiller court principally relied on Anderson, in\n\nwhich the Supreme Court required that the amount of tax be fixed by\n\nstatute.   Id.\n\n           However, the Anderson court did not state that a tax must\n\nbe based on a percentage, as the Freymiller court and appellant\n\nsuggest.   Rather, the Anderson court sought to determine whether\n\nthe debt had arisen from a contract with the government as opposed\n\nto being a tax.     203 U.S. at 492-93.   Since the government had\n\nfixed the amount of tax in a statute, the debtor was unable to\n\nnegotiate the amount of the tax, and the Court determined that the\n\nexaction was a tax rather than a contract with the government.\n\nAnderson, 203 U.S. at 493 (stating, \"But this imposition is in no\n\njust sense a contract.      The amount to be paid, fixed by the\n\nstatute, is subject to control and change at the will of the\n\nstate . . . .     The corporation is not consulted in fixing the\n\n\n                                -27-\n\famount of the tax, and under the laws of New Jersey the charter of\n\nsuch corporations as this may be amended or repealed.    The form of\n\nthe collection of taxes is left to the discretion of the taxing\n\npower . . . .\").    Thus, the Court's use of the term \"fixed by\n\nstatute\" seems to have meant merely that the exaction is based on\n\nan amount determined by the government through statute. Id. Here,\n\nthe amount of the exaction has been determined by a statutory\n\nformula, so the exaction satisfies the requirement.\n\n          Appellant also appeals to equity, arguing that granting\n\npriority treatment to appellee would contravene the \"fundamental\n\nbankruptcy principal of equality of distribution among creditors.\"\n\nSee Boston Reg'l Med. Ctr., 256 B.R. 212, 218 (Bankr. D. Mass.\n\n2000).   In support of this argument, appellant reiterates the\n\ncontention that the Commonwealth does not, itself, suffer a loss\n\nbecause any loss ultimately passes only to the acute hospitals.\n\nHowever, the hospitals are the instruments of the government's\n\nintended services to indigents:   losses to them impact adversely\n\nthe public program, which the legislature and state government\n\nentrusted to appellee to administer.        We can see no difference\n\nbetween the equities here and those that support the granting of\n\npriority to other taxes.\n\n          Finally, we ask whether this tax fits within the term\n\n\"excise tax.\"   11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(8)(E).    In another case, we have\n\nquoted Black's Law Dictionary to the effect that, \"[a]n excise tax\n\n\n                               -28-\n\fis '[a] tax imposed on the manufacture, sale, or use of goods . .\n\n. or an occupation or activity . . . .'\"   United Parcel Serv., Inc.\n\nv. Flores-Galarza, 318 F.3d 323, 326 n.1 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary at 585 (7th ed. 1999)).   The tax here can be\n\nsaid to be levied on the Massachusetts acute hospital industry,\n\nusing an overall formula to determine each hospital's share.   Like\n\nthe district court, we think it fits sufficiently within the broad\n\ndefinition of an excise.   We hold appellee's claim is entitled to\n\npriority treatment as an \"excise tax\" pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §\n\n507(a)(8)(E).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -29-\n\f",

Appellee, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, by its Division of Health Care Finance and Policy (\"HCFP\"), filed a proof of claim. After resolving a disagreement over the dollar amount, appellee finally asserted a priority of claim for $1,702,714, a sum representing appellant's unpaid prepetition obligations as an acute hospital under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, &#167; 18 to the Commonwealth's Uncompensated Care Pool (the \"Pool\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> While the debtor agreed to the dollar amount of the claim, it disputed appellee's contention that the claim was entitled to priority as an \"excise tax\" under section 507(a)(8)(E) of the Bankruptcy Code. Determining the claim was for an excise tax, the bankruptcy court overruled appellant's objection and granted priority to the claim. <i>In re Boston Reg'l Med.

As an acute hospital<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> within Massachusetts, BRMC was required by Massachusetts law to participate in the Pool (Pool).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Pool, administered by the State's Division of Health Care Finance and Policy, is a fund from which Massachusetts hospitals are paid or credited for the free health care they furnish to patients who do not have health insurance or cannot otherwise pay for hospital care. Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 118G, &#167;&#167; 18(h) and (k). The Pool's stated statutory purpose is \"to provide access to health care for low income uninsured and underinsured residents of the Commonwealth.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Id.</i> The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has stated, in respect to an earlier version of the Pool law, that the Pool's purpose is \"`to more equitably distribute the burden of uncompensated acute hospital services across all acute hospitals.'\" <i>Gen. Hosp. Corp. v. Rate Setting Comm'n,</i> 407 Mass. 227, 552 N.E.2d 113, 114 (1990) (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6A, &#167; 75).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pool funding comes both from the mandatory assessments made against each acute hospital based on its \"private sector charges,\" infra, and from other governmental funds and assessments. The amounts collected by the Pool are segregated for its own purposes and are not used to fund other governmental programs or otherwise to defray the costs of state government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 18 provides for the collection and distribution of Pool funds among the hospitals. According to section 18(e), a hospital's liability to the Pool is proportional to the amount of otherwise uncompensated care each hospital provides. Liability to the Pool (i.e., the assessment based on its private sector charges) \"shall equal the product of (1) the ratio of its private sector charges to all acute hospitals' private sector charges; and (2) the private sector liability to the uncompensated care Pool as determined by law....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In order to determine the debtor hospital's individual liability to the Pool, the HCFP must, therefore, first determine the amount of private sector charges for all hospitals in Massachusetts. \"Private sector charges\" is defined as a hospital's gross patient service revenue, less the amount of gross patient service revenue that is attributable to Medicare, Medicaid and other \"publicly aided patients, free care and bad debt.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, &#167; 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In calculating a hospital's liability to the Pool, certain credits are provided. A hospital's assessed liability to the Pool is offset against the amount owed by the Pool to the hospital for uncompensated care during the same period, thus resulting in either a net liability to the Pool or a net distribution from the Pool. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, &#167; 18(d). The Pool, therefore, charges the hospitals' collective private sector revenue to pay for the hospitals' collective burden of uncompensated care, resulting, at bottom, in a net transfer of revenue from those hospitals that provide less uncompensated care (as a proportion of the hospital's total patient service charges) to those that provide more. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, &#167;&#167; 18(d) and 18(h). To the extent a hospital receives reimbursement for free care directly from Medicare, Medicaid or another source other than the Pool, the amount owed by all other hospitals is reduced because the amount of funding required from the Pool is reduced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, \"disproportionate share hospitals\" &#8212; which are hospitals that have \"a payer mix where a minimum of sixty-three percent of the acute hospital's gross patient service revenue is attributable to [certain government payments] and free care\" &#8212; and \"non-disproportionate share hospitals\" &#8212; which do not have that payer mix &#8212; receive different treatment under section 18. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118, &#167; 1. In the event that the Pool does not have sufficient funds to reimburse all hospitals for all of the free care provided, the amount paid from the Pool is weighted towards disproportionate share hospitals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to section 18, BRMC owes appellee a total of $1,702,714, representing the total amount due to the Pool for the following fiscal years:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. 1996 &#8212; $1,580,506</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. 1997 &#8212; $ 60,639</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. 1998 &#8212; $ (77,744) credit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. 1999 &#8212; $ 139,313</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court concluded that the foregoing total Pool claim was entitled to priority as an excise tax, thus giving rise to the single issue presented in the current appeal. <i>BRMC II,</i> 264 B.R. at 229-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Present Contentions and the Opinions Below</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it did below, the appellant now argues that the claim for the Pool assessment owed by BRMC is not for an \"excise tax,\" thus not entitled to priority, under &#167; 507(a)(8)(E) of the Bankruptcy Code. In BRMC's view, the bankruptcy and district courts failed to engage in an adequate \"functional analysis\" of the nature of the statutory assessment underlying the Pool claim. BRMC contends that the Pool statute is in form and function merely a risk sharing plan imposed on acute hospitals &#8212; a plan, that, instead of being a tax, is really only a regulatory fee imposed for the privilege of operating an acute hospital in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, appellee argues that the mandatory exaction placed by Massachusetts law upon the state's acute hospitals is a tax, having been legislatively established to raise monies to advance the public purpose of promoting continued access to acute hospital services by low-income uninsured and underinsured residents of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling that the Pool assessment is a tax, not a fee, the bankruptcy court similarly laid particular emphasis upon the exaction's public purpose &#8212; the promotion of hospital access to low-income uninsured and underinsured residents of Massachusetts. <i>BRMC II,</i> 264 B.R. at 225. That, coupled with its involuntary character and its other functional attributes, was found to differentiate it from a regulatory fee. <i>Id.</i> at 225-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In affirming the bankruptcy court's opinion, the district court stated from the bench that the bankruptcy court's reasoning was persuasive with \"one possible exception.\" The court said the mere fact that the Pool exaction was paid in order to serve the public welfare would not necessarily demonstrate it was an excise tax. Almost everything paid to the government, the court suggested, is intended for a public purpose. Here, however, the court found the exaction to be targeted specifically at paying for medical care for members of the public unable to pay for themselves. Unlike the case of a driver's license or other fee, the money is not collected by the government simply to confer a benefit on the payer or to pay itself for a government service rendered to the payer. \"Functionally and under the so-called <i>Suburban</i> factors, this is a tax,\" the district court said. Further, the tax is an excise, the court continued, citing a definition found in Black's Law Dictionary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Discussion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue is whether the assessments for the Uncompensated Care Pool imposed upon appellant under state law constitute \"excise taxes\" and, therefore, are entitled to priority under section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.

In <i>Suburban II,</i> the Sixth Circuit expressed concern over the adequacy and possible one-sidedness of <i>Lorber</i>'s \"public purpose\" prong, and it added two additional factors of its own, namely (5) whether the exaction is universally applied to all similarly situated entities and (6) whether the granting of priority status to a governmental claimant would prejudice private creditors with like claims. <i>Suburban II,</i> 36 F.3d at 488-89; <i>see also BRMC I,</i> 291 F.3d at 121 n. 10 (sharing <i>Suburban II</i> court's concern that <i>Lorber,</i> by itself, was \"incomplete and one-sided, and may lead to incorrect results.\") (citing <i>Suburban II,</i> 36 F.3d at 488-89; <i>Indus.

Reorganized CF &amp; I Fabricators of Utah, Inc.,</i> a case decided after the Ninth and Sixth Circuits' decisions in <i>Lorber</i> and <i>Suburban II.</i> In <i>CF &amp; I,</i> the Court made no mention of <i>Lorber</i> or <i>Suburban II.</i> Rather, it emphasized the \"continuing vitality of the cases in the <i>Feiring</i> line.\" <i>CF &amp; I,</i> 518 U.S. at 222, 116 S.Ct. 2106. But <i>Lorber</i> and <i>Suburban II</i> undertook to apply the principles stated in the <i>Feiring</i> line, and we see nothing in <i>CF &amp; I</i> that renders those circuit precedents no longer useful constructs. We faced this issue recently in <i>BRMC I,</i> holding that <i>Lorber</i> and the <i>Suburban</i> cases remained persuasive after <i>CF &amp; I.</i> We said in <i>BRMC I:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BAP treated <i>Anderson</i> and [<i>Feiring</i>] on the one hand, and <i>Lorber</i> and the two <i>Suburban</i> cases on the other, as developing different and apparently mutually exclusive tests.

The <i>Lorber/ Suburban II</i> approach therefore remains an available tool of analysis, although, of course, subject at all times to the overarching authority of <i>Feiring</i> and <i>Anderson. See, e.g., San Juan Cellular v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Puerto Rico,</i> 967 F.2d 683, 684-687 (1st Cir.1992) (utilizing an approach that approximated the first three prongs of <i>Lorber</i>); <i>In re Ludlow Hosp.

Many other courts have found <i>Lorber/Suburban II</i> to be consistent with, and useful in applying, the controlling <i>Feiring-Anderson</i> rationale. <i>See In re Cassidy,</i> 983 F.2d 161, 163 (10th Cir.1992); <i>Indus.

Soc'y, Inc.,</i> as adopted by the bankruptcy court below. <i>BRMC II,</i> 264 B.R. at 226 (citing <i>In re Ludlow Hosp. Soc'y, Inc.,</i> 216 B.R. at 318-20).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>1. Involuntary Burden</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We ask first whether the Pool exaction was an involuntary pecuniary burden. <i>Lorber,</i> 675 F.2d at 1066. The <i>Lorber</i> court explained that an \"involuntary pecuniary burden\" was a \"non-contractual obligation imposed by state statute upon taxpayers who had not consented to its imposition.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Dungan v. Dept. of Agric., State of Calif.,</i> 332 F.2d 793 (9th Cir.1964), <i>aff'g In re Farmers Frozen Food Co.,</i> 221 F.Supp. 385 (N.D.Cal.1963)). The exaction here was imposed by statute; it was neither consented to, nor part of a contract. It was thus an involuntary pecuniary burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the assessment was nonetheless voluntary because each acute hospital could to some degree regulate its obligation to the Pool by choosing to provide more or less free care. However, acute hospitals within the ambit of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, &#167; 18 have no legal option but to pay or credit such assessments as are due. And even if appellant enlarged the quantum of free care it provided, it could not be certain to avoid liability. An acute hospital's liability is based, in part, upon the amount of free care that all other acute hospitals in the state have provided for that same year &#8212; an unpredictable amount. The only way appellant could be certain to avoid sharing in the burdens of the Pool would be to cease all acute care operations. <i>See In re Suburban Motor Freight,</i> 156 B.R. 790, 792 (S.D.Ohio 1992) (concluding that the statute insurance scheme in favor of private insurance was involuntary since employers were not permitted to opt out and rejecting argument that scheme was voluntary because employers could choose not to be under it by refusing to conduct business in the state). By appellant's rationale, the federal income tax would not qualify as a \"tax\" because the taxpayer may voluntarily minimize his or her tax liability by earning less income or by taking advantage of deductions. <i>See, e.g., In re Sacred Heart Hosp.,</i> 212 B.R. at 474 (stating, \"All taxes may be avoided by a `choice' of the taxpayer\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Exaction Imposed Under State's Authority</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, there is no dispute the Pool exaction is imposed under the authority of the Massachusetts legislature. <i>Lorber,</i> 675 F.2d at 1066.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>3. Exaction Was For A Public Purpose</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thirdly, the Pool exaction is for a public purpose, i.e. for the defraying of expenses or undertakings of a type commonly assumed by the government &#8212; namely, those providing free health care to persons without the resources to pay for it. <i>Lorber,</i> 675 F.2d at 1066. There is no correlation between what a hospital pays and the receipt in return of some particular service. Rather, the hospital is obliged, based on an equitable formula, to help fund hospitals around the state that serve indigent members of the public, thus enabling Massachusetts to provide free care to residents. Disproportionate share hospitals rely on Pool funds to remain in business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> While acute hospitals are the exclusive recipients of these funds, the amount each receives relates to the amount of free public services each provides. Under the statutory scheme, individual hospitals serve as conduits through which the Pool channels funds to pay for the free care rendered to uninsured or underinsured patients. This court stated in <i>San Juan Cellular,</i> 967 F.2d at 685, that \"[c]ourts facing cases that lie in the middle of this spectrum have tended (sometimes with minor differences reflecting the different statutes at issue) to emphasize the revenue's ultimate use,....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The \"ultimate use\" here is a valid governmental purpose &#8212; one specifically identified in the relevant Massachusetts statute. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 118G, &#167; 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the exaction does not defray costs of the Commonwealth because the Pool merely spreads the cost of care among the acute hospitals. It further notes that the funds of the Pool are segregated from other state revenues and not used to fund other governmental operations of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. According to appellant, the exaction is merely to defray costs and provide benefits to hospitals participating in the program rather than to the Commonwealth and the general public. In support of this argument, appellant analogizes the Pool to the Unemployment Compensation Fund in <i>BRMC I.</i> We disagree. In <i>BRMC I,</i> we concluded that the fund scheme was not a tax because, among other reasons, \"The distinction between the payments required to sustain a government undertaking as a whole and those required merely to compensate for the costs imposed by a particular participant is significant.\" 291 F.3d at 122. Here the payments to the Pool are geared to sustain, as a whole, the stated governmental undertaking of providing access to health care for low-income uninsured and underinsured residents of the Commonwealth. Accordingly, these costs are distinguishable from the costs in <i>BRMC I.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is the Pool analogous to the Unemployment Compensation Fund. To be sure, the Pool operates as a sort of risk sharing plan, but that does not preclude it from satisfying the public purpose requirement. <i>See Williams v. Motley,</i> 925 F.2d 741, 745 (4th Cir.1991) (pool of funds to be distributed among all of the state's automobile insurers to compensate for uninsured drivers was a tax, not a regulatory fee, because the pool's purpose was to benefit the general public by reducing the overall costs of uninsured motorist insurance coverage). We have expressed a willingness to declare such fund-type mechanisms \"taxes.\" <i>See San Juan Cellular Tel. Co.,</i> 967 F.2d at 685 (stating, \"Or, [a tax] may serve such purposes indirectly by, for example, raising money placed in a special fund to help defray the agency's regulation-related expenses.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>4. Pool Assessment Imposed Under Police Or Taxing Power</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourthly, there is no dispute that the Pool assessment was imposed pursuant to the Commonwealth's police or taxing power. <i>Lorber,</i> 675 F.2d at 1066.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>5. Assessment Uniformly Applied To All</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifthly, the Pool assessment is uniformly applied to all similarly situated entities. <i>Suburban II,</i> 36 F.3d at 489. The debtor argues that since the Pool statute favors disproportionate share hospitals, it is not uniformly applied. It points out that hospitals providing a disproportionate amount of free care receive the most benefit from the Pool. For example, after years where there is a deficiency in the Pool, those disproportionate share hospitals with the greatest proportional requirement for Pool income have to pay less of a share into the Pool than do the other hospitals. Also, in the event that the Pool does not have sufficient funds to reimburse all hospitals for all of the free care provided, the amount paid from the Pool is weighted towards disproportionate share hospitals. However, all acute hospitals are subject to the same rules; all similarly situated hospitals are treated alike. <i>See, e.g., Ludlow Hosp. Soc'y, Inc.,</i> 216 B.R. at 320 (finding that Pool satisfied requirement that the assessment be universally applied to similarly situated entities because the obligation to participate in the Pool is \"universally imposed on all acute hospitals in the Commonwealth\"). Under the Pool assessment scheme, acute hospitals with the same financial profiles in any given year will have the same liability in the Pool. <i>Boston Reg'l Med. Ctr.,</i> 264 B.R. at 227. Under debtor's reasoning, the federal personal income tax, which treats people with different incomes differently, would not constitute a tax. We conclude the exaction here is applied uniformly to similarly situated entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>6. No Prejudice To Private Creditors</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, under the final <i>Lorber/Suburban II</i> factor, we consider if granting priority to the Pool assessment would prejudice private creditors with like claims. <i>Suburban II,</i> 36 F.3d at 489. The <i>Suburban II</i> court framed this sixth requirement because it was concerned that private actors who might, in some cases, perform the same function as the government would be given inferior priority. <i>Suburban II,</i> 36 F.3d at 488 (stating \"<i>If the State had an optional participation program, or allowed employers to purchase private liability insurance, it would be unfair and without statutory justification to call state-collected premiums `taxes' and put the Bureau ahead in line while leaving unpaid private insurers to languish along with the rest of the unsecured creditors.</i>\") (quoting <i>Suburban I,</i> 998 F.2d at 342) (emphasis supplied) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court determined there were \"no private creditors with claims sufficiently similar to [appellee's] who would suffer any disadvantage by conferring priority treatment to a Pool claim.\" We agree. Appellant points to no private creditor with a role comparable to appellee's. No private entity with power to require hospitals to contribute to a fund for the sake of preserving free care for the indigent has been identified. <i>See Camilli,</i> 94 F.3d at 1334. Instead, appellant seeks to switch the argument to the purported lack of injury to appellee if it does not receive priority as a creditor. According to appellant, appellee state agency (rather than the hospitals themselves) will suffer no loss in any event. Supposedly this indicates the exaction is a regulatory fee. This argument, however, ignores the loss to the government's program, aimed at furnishing free hospital services to the public, if the assessment is unpaid. The argument, moreover, is beside the point; as it focuses on the purported lack of harm to the government creditor rather than on whether granting priority to the Pool assessment will prejudice a private creditor. As appellant's argument has nothing to do with the government's position in relation to similarly situated private entities, it is not germane.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the Pool assessment satisfies all of the <i>Lorber/ Suburban II</i> criteria for a tax. Appellant, however, argues that a court must additionally inquire whether the non-tax characteristics, particularly the regulatory fee characteristics, of the exaction outweigh the tax characteristics. Since the <i>Lorber/Suburban II</i> criteria were developed to subsume that inquiry, we arguably need not entertain it. But because the exercise is illuminating, we take it on, finding that it leads to the same result as was reached under <i>Lorber/Suburban II.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulatory fees have been defined as \"monies paid to the government incident to a voluntary act that bestows a benefit on the applicant, not shared by other members of society.\" <i>N. Dakota Workers Comp. Bureau v. Voightman (In re Voightman),</i> 239 B.R. 380, 383 (8th Cir.BAP 1999); <i>see also Nat'l Cable Television Ass'n, Inc. v. United States,</i> 415 U.S. 336, 340-41, 94 S.Ct. 1146, 39 L.Ed.2d 370 (1974) (defining regulatory fees same way in non-bankruptcy context). Similarly, in <i>San Juan Cellular,</i> we approved of the approach utilized by other courts, which &#8212; in distinguishing a tax from a regulatory fee &#8212; focused on the \"revenue's ultimate use, asking whether it provides a general benefit to the public, of a sort often financed by a general tax, or whether it provides a more narrow benefit[ ] to regulated companies or defray[s] the agency's cost of regulation.\" 967 F.2d at 685. The ultimate design and use of the exaction here are to help finance the provision of hospital care to people unable to pay for it themselves. While specialized and somewhat intricate, it finances a general benefit to the public of a kind that could properly have been financed from more ordinary tax revenues. Per contra, the Pool scheme is not aimed at bestowing a narrow benefit upon the payer hospital, nor defraying the cost of regulation. We conclude the exaction is a tax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant makes various other arguments not so far addressed. We briefly discuss some of them, finding none to have merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on <i>BRMC I,</i> appellant argues that since appellee, itself, does not have to pay any shortfall in the Pool, it is not an involuntary creditor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> In <i>BRMC I,</i> we stated that \"[o]ne of the important reasons for giving special priority in bankruptcy to taxes is that state and federal governments do not generally choose their tax debtors.\" 291 F.3d at 123. Taxing authorities receive priority treatment because, inter alia, they are \"involuntary creditor[s] of the debtor,\" who are unable to \"take security in advance of the time that taxes become due.\" <i>Id.</i> In concluding that the exaction in <i>BRMC I</i> was not a tax, we noted the law would have allowed the Commonwealth to have required BRMC to post a surety to secure its anticipated <i>future</i> liability to the fund at issue. Here, however, appellee has no authority to require security in advance. Its remedies are ex post facto. Upon non-payment by an acute hospital, appellee can only then either re-calibrate the Pool in accordance with the statutory formula for the next year or choose, for example, to refuse to renew the expired licenses of a defaulting acute hospital. The appellee cannot be said, therefore, to choose its debtors, nor is appellee other than an involuntary creditor. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a different tack, appellant contends that for an exaction to be a tax, the statute must provide the government with an automatic lien to secure payment. The existence of an automatic lien provision was one of several attributes of a tax listed by the bankruptcy court in <i>Park</i> and <i>Columbia Packing.</i> However, the absence of such a lien was not said to prevent an exaction from being a tax. Here, appellee has different remedies at its disposal, including the ability to offset payments due to the defaulting hospital's Medicaid claims. <i>BRMC II,</i> 264 B.R. at 225, 228 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, &#167; 18(g)). Appellant's argument in this regard seems inconsistent with our statement in <i>BRMC I</i> that the absence of pre-default security for payment would militate in favor of finding a priority claim. <i>BRMC I,</i> 291 F.3d at 123.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that the amount of an exaction must be fixed by statute in order to qualify as a tax and that, since the amount of the assessment here varies depending on the amount of free care given by all acute hospitals, the exaction is not sufficiently fixed by statute. In support of this claim, appellant relies solely on <i>In re Freymiller Trucking, Inc.</i> There, the Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Oklahoma stated, \"I am unable to think of a `tax'... that is not based on a percentage of something, be it income, sales, corporate capital, or the value of property, a gift or inheritance.\" 194 B.R. 914, 915 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1996). In concluding that a tax assesses at a \"fixed rate,\" the <i>Freymiller</i> court principally relied on <i>Anderson,</i> in which the Supreme Court required that the amount of tax be fixed by statute. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the <i>Anderson</i> court did not state that a tax must be based on a percentage, as the <i>Freymiller</i> court and appellant suggest. Rather, the <i>Anderson</i> court sought to determine whether the debt had arisen from a contract with the government as opposed to being a tax. 203 U.S. at 492-93, 27 S.Ct. 137. Since the government had fixed the amount of tax in a statute, the debtor was unable to negotiate the amount of the tax, and the Court determined that the exaction was a tax rather than a contract with the government. <i>Anderson,</i> 203 U.S. at 493, 27 S.Ct. 137 (stating, \"But this imposition is in no just sense a contract. The amount to be paid, fixed by the statute, is subject to control and change at the will of the state.... The corporation is not consulted in fixing the amount of the tax, and under the laws of New Jersey the charter of such corporations as this may be amended or repealed. The form of the collection of taxes is left to the discretion of the taxing power....\"). Thus, the Court's use of the term \"fixed by statute\" seems to have meant merely that the exaction is based on an amount determined by the government through statute. <i>Id.</i> Here, the amount of the exaction has been determined by a statutory formula, so the exaction satisfies the requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also appeals to equity, arguing that granting priority treatment to appellee would contravene the \"fundamental bankruptcy principal of equality of distribution among creditors.\" <i>See Boston Reg'l Med. Ctr.,</i> 256 B.R. 212, 218 (Bankr.D.Mass.2000). In support of this argument, appellant reiterates the contention that the Commonwealth does not, itself, suffer a loss because any loss ultimately passes only to the acute hospitals. However, the hospitals are the instruments of the government's intended services to indigents: losses to them impact adversely the public program, which the legislature and state government entrusted to appellee to administer. We can see no difference between the equities here and those that support the granting of priority to other taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we ask whether this tax fits within the term \"excise tax.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 507(a)(8)(E). In another case, we have quoted Black's Law Dictionary to the effect that, \"[a]n excise tax is `[a] tax imposed on the manufacture, sale, or use of goods... or an occupation or activity....'\" <i>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza,</i> 318 F.3d 323, 326 n. 1 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> at 585 (7th ed. 1999)). The tax here can be said to be levied on the Massachusetts acute hospital industry, using an overall formula to determine each hospital's share. Like the district court, we think it fits sufficiently within the broad definition of an excise. We hold appellee's claim is entitled to priority treatment as an \"excise tax\" pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 507(a)(8)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Mass.

According to section 18(e), a hospital's liability to the Pool is proportional to the amount of otherwise uncompensated care each hospital provides. Liability to the Pool (i.e., the assessment based on its private sector charges) \"shall equal the product of (1) the ratio of its private sector charges to all acute hospitals' private sector charges; and (2) the private sector liability to the uncompensated care Pool as determined by law....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In order to determine the debtor hospital's individual liability to the Pool, the HCFP must, therefore, first determine the amount of private sector charges for all hospitals in Massachusetts. \"Private sector charges\" is defined as a hospital's gross patient service revenue, less the amount of gross patient service revenue that is attributable to Medicare, Medicaid and other \"publicly aided patients, free care and bad debt.\" Mass.

Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, &#167; 18(d). The Pool, therefore, charges the hospitals' collective private sector revenue to pay for the hospitals' collective burden of uncompensated care, resulting, at bottom, in a net transfer of revenue from those hospitals that provide less uncompensated care (as a proportion of the hospital's total patient service charges) to those that provide more. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, &#167;&#167; 18(d) and 18(h).

BRMC contends that the Pool statute is in form and function merely a risk sharing plan imposed on acute hospitals &#8212; a plan, that, instead of being a tax, is really only a regulatory fee imposed for the privilege of operating an acute hospital in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, appellee argues that the mandatory exaction placed by Massachusetts law upon the state's acute hospitals is a tax, having been legislatively established to raise monies to advance the public purpose of promoting continued access to acute hospital services by low-income uninsured and underinsured residents of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling that the Pool assessment is a tax, not a fee, the bankruptcy court similarly laid particular emphasis upon the exaction's public purpose &#8212; the promotion of hospital access to low-income uninsured and underinsured residents of Massachusetts. <i>BRMC II,</i> 264 B.R. at 225.

Almost everything paid to the government, the court suggested, is intended for a public purpose. Here, however, the court found the exaction to be targeted specifically at paying for medical care for members of the public unable to pay for themselves. Unlike the case of a driver's license or other fee, the money is not collected by the government simply to confer a benefit on the payer or to pay itself for a government service rendered to the payer. \"Functionally and under the so-called <i>Suburban</i> factors, this is a tax,\" the district court said. Further, the tax is an excise, the court continued, citing a definition found in Black's Law Dictionary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Discussion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue is whether the assessments for the Uncompensated Care Pool imposed upon appellant under state law constitute \"excise taxes\" and, therefore, are entitled to priority under section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.

Soc'y, Inc.,</i> as adopted by the bankruptcy court below. <i>BRMC II,</i> 264 B.R. at 226 (citing <i>In re Ludlow Hosp.

The <i>Lorber</i> court explained that an \"involuntary pecuniary burden\" was a \"non-contractual obligation imposed by state statute upon taxpayers who had not consented to its imposition.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Dungan v. Dept. of Agric., State of Calif.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></span> (9th Cir.1964), <i>aff'g In re Farmers Frozen Food Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1527332\"><a href=\"/opinion/1527332/in-re-farmers-frozen-food-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

However, acute hospitals within the ambit of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, &#167; 18 have no legal option but to pay or credit such assessments as are due. And even if appellant enlarged the quantum of free care it provided, it could not be certain to avoid liability. An acute hospital's liability is based, in part, upon the amount of free care that all other acute hospitals in the state have provided for that same year &#8212; an unpredictable amount. The only way appellant could be certain to avoid sharing in the burdens of the Pool would be to cease all acute care operations. <i>See In re Suburban Motor Freight,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1522487\"><a href=\"/opinion/1522487/in-re-suburban-motor-freight-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span>, 792 (S.D.Ohio 1992) (concluding that the statute insurance scheme in favor of private insurance was involuntary since employers were not permitted to opt out and rejecting argument that scheme was voluntary because employers could choose not to be under it by refusing to conduct business in the state). By appellant's rationale, the federal income tax would not qualify as a \"tax\" because the taxpayer may voluntarily minimize his or her tax liability by earning less income or by taking advantage of deductions. <i>See, e.g., In re Sacred Heart Hosp.,</i> 212 B.R. at 474 (stating, \"All taxes may be avoided by a `choice' of the taxpayer\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Exaction Imposed Under State's Authority</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, there is no dispute the Pool exaction is imposed under the authority of the Massachusetts legislature. <i>Lorber,</i> 675 F.2d at 1066.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>3. Exaction Was For A Public Purpose</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thirdly, the Pool exaction is for a public purpose, i.e. for the defraying of expenses or undertakings of a type commonly assumed by the government &#8212; namely, those providing free health care to persons without the resources to pay for it. <i>Lorber,</i> 675 F.2d at 1066. There is no correlation between what a hospital pays and the receipt in return of some particular service. Rather, the hospital is obliged, based on an equitable formula, to help fund hospitals around the state that serve indigent members of the public, thus enabling Massachusetts to provide free care to residents. Disproportionate share hospitals rely on Pool funds to remain in business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> While acute hospitals are the exclusive recipients of these funds, the amount each receives relates to the amount of free public services each provides. Under the statutory scheme, individual hospitals serve as conduits through which the Pool channels funds to pay for the free care rendered to uninsured or underinsured patients. This court stated in <i>San Juan Cellular,</i> 967 F.2d at 685, that \"[c]ourts facing cases that lie in the middle of this spectrum have tended (sometimes with minor differences reflecting the different statutes at issue) to emphasize the revenue's ultimate use,....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The \"ultimate use\" here is a valid governmental purpose &#8212; one specifically identified in the relevant Massachusetts statute. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 118G, &#167; 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the exaction does not defray costs of the Commonwealth because the Pool merely spreads the cost of care among the acute hospitals. It further notes that the funds of the Pool are segregated from other state revenues and not used to fund other governmental operations of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. According to appellant, the exaction is merely to defray costs and provide benefits to hospitals participating in the program rather than to the Commonwealth and the general public. In support of this argument, appellant analogizes the Pool to the Unemployment Compensation Fund in <i>BRMC I.</i> We disagree. In <i>BRMC I,</i> we concluded that the fund scheme was not a tax because, among other reasons, \"The distinction between the payments required to sustain a government undertaking as a whole and those required merely to compensate for the costs imposed by a particular participant is significant.\" 291 F.3d at 122. Here the payments to the Pool are geared to sustain, as a whole, the stated governmental undertaking of providing access to health care for low-income uninsured and underinsured residents of the Commonwealth. Accordingly, these costs are distinguishable from the costs in <i>BRMC I.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is the Pool analogous to the Unemployment Compensation Fund. To be sure, the Pool operates as a sort of risk sharing plan, but that does not preclude it from satisfying the public purpose requirement. <i>See Williams v. Motley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555794\"><a href=\"/opinion/555794/donald-e-williams-commissioner-department-of-motor-vehicles/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span>, 745 (4th Cir.1991) (pool of funds to be distributed among all of the state's automobile insurers to compensate for uninsured drivers was a tax, not a regulatory fee, because the pool's purpose was to benefit the general public by reducing the overall costs of uninsured motorist insurance coverage). We have expressed a willingness to declare such fund-type mechanisms \"taxes.\" <i>See San Juan Cellular Tel. Co.,</i> 967 F.2d at 685 (stating, \"Or, [a tax] may serve such purposes indirectly by, for example, raising money placed in a special fund to help defray the agency's regulation-related expenses.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>4.

Assessment Uniformly Applied To All</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifthly, the Pool assessment is uniformly applied to all similarly situated entities. <i>Suburban II,</i> 36 F.3d at 489. The debtor argues that since the Pool statute favors disproportionate share hospitals, it is not uniformly applied. It points out that hospitals providing a disproportionate amount of free care receive the most benefit from the Pool. For example, after years where there is a deficiency in the Pool, those disproportionate share hospitals with the greatest proportional requirement for Pool income have to pay less of a share into the Pool than do the other hospitals. Also, in the event that the Pool does not have sufficient funds to reimburse all hospitals for all of the free care provided, the amount paid from the Pool is weighted towards disproportionate share hospitals. However, all acute hospitals are subject to the same rules; all similarly situated hospitals are treated alike. <i>See, e.g., Ludlow Hosp. Soc'y, Inc.,</i> 216 B.R. at 320 (finding that Pool satisfied requirement that the assessment be universally applied to similarly situated entities because the obligation to participate in the Pool is \"universally imposed on all acute hospitals in the Commonwealth\"). Under the Pool assessment scheme, acute hospitals with the same financial profiles in any given year will have the same liability in the Pool. <i>Boston Reg'l Med. Ctr.,</i> 264 B.R. at 227. Under debtor's reasoning, the federal personal income tax, which treats people with different incomes differently, would not constitute a tax. We conclude the exaction here is applied uniformly to similarly situated entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>6. No Prejudice To Private Creditors</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, under the final <i>Lorber/Suburban II</i> factor, we consider if granting priority to the Pool assessment would prejudice private creditors with like claims. <i>Suburban II,</i> 36 F.3d at 489. The <i>Suburban II</i> court framed this sixth requirement because it was concerned that private actors who might, in some cases, perform the same function as the government would be given inferior priority. <i>Suburban II,</i> 36 F.3d at 488 (stating \"<i>If the State had an optional participation program, or allowed employers to purchase private liability insurance, it would be unfair and without statutory justification to call state-collected premiums `taxes' and put the Bureau ahead in line while leaving unpaid private insurers to languish along with the rest of the unsecured creditors.</i>\") (quoting <i>Suburban I,</i> 998 F.2d at 342) (emphasis supplied) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court determined there were \"no private creditors with claims sufficiently similar to [appellee's] who would suffer any disadvantage by conferring priority treatment to a Pool claim.\" We agree. Appellant points to no private creditor with a role comparable to appellee's. No private entity with power to require hospitals to contribute to a fund for the sake of preserving free care for the indigent has been identified. <i>See Camilli,</i> 94 F.3d at 1334. Instead, appellant seeks to switch the argument to the purported lack of injury to appellee if it does not receive priority as a creditor. According to appellant, appellee state agency (rather than the hospitals themselves) will suffer no loss in any event. Supposedly this indicates the exaction is a regulatory fee. This argument, however, ignores the loss to the government's program, aimed at furnishing free hospital services to the public, if the assessment is unpaid. The argument, moreover, is beside the point; as it focuses on the purported lack of harm to the government creditor rather than on whether granting priority to the Pool assessment will prejudice a private creditor. As appellant's argument has nothing to do with the government's position in relation to similarly situated private entities, it is not germane.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the Pool assessment satisfies all of the <i>Lorber/ Suburban II</i> criteria for a tax. Appellant, however, argues that a court must additionally inquire whether the non-tax characteristics, particularly the regulatory fee characteristics, of the exaction outweigh the tax characteristics. Since the <i>Lorber/Suburban II</i> criteria were developed to subsume that inquiry, we arguably need not entertain it. But because the exercise is illuminating, we take it on, finding that it leads to the same result as was reached under <i>Lorber/Suburban II.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulatory fees have been defined as \"monies paid to the government incident to a voluntary act that bestows a benefit on the applicant, not shared by other members of society.\" <i>N. Dakota Workers Comp. Bureau v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span> (1974) (defining regulatory fees same way in non-bankruptcy context). Similarly, in <i>San Juan Cellular,</i> we approved of the approach utilized by other courts, which &#8212; in distinguishing a tax from a regulatory fee &#8212; focused on the \"revenue's ultimate use, asking whether it provides a general benefit to the public, of a sort often financed by a general tax, or whether it provides a more narrow benefit[ ] to regulated companies or defray[s] the agency's cost of regulation.\" 967 F.2d at 685. The ultimate design and use of the exaction here are to help finance the provision of hospital care to people unable to pay for it themselves. While specialized and somewhat intricate, it finances a general benefit to the public of a kind that could properly have been financed from more ordinary tax revenues. Per contra, the Pool scheme is not aimed at bestowing a narrow benefit upon the payer hospital, nor defraying the cost of regulation. We conclude the exaction is a tax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant makes various other arguments not so far addressed. We briefly discuss some of them, finding none to have merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on <i>BRMC I,</i> appellant argues that since appellee, itself, does not have to pay any shortfall in the Pool, it is not an involuntary creditor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> In <i>BRMC I,</i> we stated that \"[o]ne of the important reasons for giving special priority in bankruptcy to taxes is that state and federal governments do not generally choose their tax debtors.\" 291 F.3d at 123. Taxing authorities receive priority treatment because, inter alia, they are \"involuntary creditor[s] of the debtor,\" who are unable to \"take security in advance of the time that taxes become due.\" <i>Id.</i> In concluding that the exaction in <i>BRMC I</i> was not a tax, we noted the law would have allowed the Commonwealth to have required BRMC to post a surety to secure its anticipated <i>future</i> liability to the fund at issue. Here, however, appellee has no authority to require security in advance. Its remedies are ex post facto. Upon non-payment by an acute hospital, appellee can only then either re-calibrate the Pool in accordance with the statutory formula for the next year or choose, for example, to refuse to renew the expired licenses of a defaulting acute hospital. The appellee cannot be said, therefore, to choose its debtors, nor is appellee other than an involuntary creditor. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a different tack, appellant contends that for an exaction to be a tax, the statute must provide the government with an automatic lien to secure payment. The existence of an automatic lien provision was one of several attributes of a tax listed by the bankruptcy court in <i>Park</i> and <i>Columbia Packing.</i> However, the absence of such a lien was not said to prevent an exaction from being a tax. Here, appellee has different remedies at its disposal, including the ability to offset payments due to the defaulting hospital's Medicaid claims. <i>BRMC II,</i> 264 B.R. at 225, 228 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, &#167; 18(g)). Appellant's argument in this regard seems inconsistent with our statement in <i>BRMC I</i> that the absence of pre-default security for payment would militate in favor of finding a priority claim. <i>BRMC I,</i> 291 F.3d at 123.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that the amount of an exaction must be fixed by statute in order to qualify as a tax and that, since the amount of the assessment here varies depending on the amount of free care given by all acute hospitals, the exaction is not sufficiently fixed by statute. In support of this claim, appellant relies solely on <i>In re Freymiller Trucking, Inc.</i> There, the Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Oklahoma stated, \"I am unable to think of a `tax'... that is not based on a percentage of something, be it income, sales, corporate capital, or the value of property, a gift or inheritance.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1992955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1992955/in-re-freymiller-trucking-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 915 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1996). In concluding that a tax assesses at a \"fixed rate,\" the <i>Freymiller</i> court principally relied on <i>Anderson,</i> in which the Supreme Court required that the amount of tax be fixed by statute. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the <i>Anderson</i> court did not state that a tax must be based on a percentage, as the <i>Freymiller</i> court and appellant suggest. Rather, the <i>Anderson</i> court sought to determine whether the debt had arisen from a contract with the government as opposed to being a tax. 203 U.S. at 492-93, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96546\"><a href=\"/opinion/96546/new-jersey-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>. Since the government had fixed the amount of tax in a statute, the debtor was unable to negotiate the amount of the tax, and the Court determined that the exaction was a tax rather than a contract with the government. <i>Anderson,</i> 203 U.S. at 493, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96546\"><a href=\"/opinion/96546/new-jersey-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span> (stating, \"But this imposition is in no just sense a contract. The amount to be paid, fixed by the statute, is subject to control and change at the will of the state.... The corporation is not consulted in fixing the amount of the tax, and under the laws of New Jersey the charter of such corporations as this may be amended or repealed. The form of the collection of taxes is left to the discretion of the taxing power....\"). Thus, the Court's use of the term \"fixed by statute\" seems to have meant merely that the exaction is based on an amount determined by the government through statute. <i>Id.</i> Here, the amount of the exaction has been determined by a statutory formula, so the exaction satisfies the requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also appeals to equity, arguing that granting priority treatment to appellee would contravene the \"fundamental bankruptcy principal of equality of distribution among creditors.\" <i>See Boston Reg'l Med. Ctr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1549803\"><a href=\"/opinion/1549803/in-re-boston-regional-medical-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 218 (Bankr.D.Mass.2000). In support of this argument, appellant reiterates the contention that the Commonwealth does not, itself, suffer a loss because any loss ultimately passes only to the acute hospitals. However, the hospitals are the instruments of the government's intended services to indigents: losses to them impact adversely the public program, which the legislature and state government entrusted to appellee to administer. We can see no difference between the equities here and those that support the granting of priority to other taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we ask whether this tax fits within the term \"excise tax.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 507(a)(8)(E). In another case, we have quoted Black's Law Dictionary to the effect that, \"[a]n excise tax is `[a] tax imposed on the manufacture, sale, or use of goods... or an occupation or activity....'\" <i>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200320\"><a href=\"/opinion/200320/united-parcel-v-flores-galarza/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 326 n. 1 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> at 585 (7th ed. 1999)). The tax here can be said to be levied on the Massachusetts acute hospital industry, using an overall formula to determine each hospital's share.
