A request for a three-judge court was denied since, although a substantial constitutional question was presented, the district court found that the Common-wealth statute at issue \"affects only the electorate of San Juan and not the rest of the Commonwealth.\"  Appellants' claims were subsequently rejected by the court.  We have decided that a three-judge court is required to hear appellants' contentions, and consequently remand for a trial before such a court without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case.  Goosby v.

Board of Commissioners, 307 U.S. 208, 212, 59 S.Ct. 808, 811, 83 L.Ed. 1242 (1939).

United States, 323 U.S. 329, 65 S.Ct. 280, 89 L.Ed. 274 (1945), thereby seemingly focusing more on the application or impact of the state statute, rather than on the breadth of the concerns which it manifested.  This view was reinforced in Moody v.

In New Left, the Court left no doubt that Alabama State Teachers Ass'n had been properly before it, stating that \"that action, although having a local impact, [was alleged to be] expressive of an official, statewide policy to maintain a racially identifiable, dual system of education. . . .

Reference to predecessors of the challenged statute reveals that Act No. 99, Sec. 55 (1931), first established an appointed Board of Commissioners for the capital of Puerto Rico with a changeover to a fully elected board to occur in 1937.  However, Act No. 10 (1936) amended the 1931 law to provide for a nine-member Board with five popularly elected members and four appointed by the Governor.  In 1960 the present law was enacted whereby the Governor appoints five of seventeen members.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale underlying the current law was thus expressed by the Majority Leader of the Senate:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>\"Now the decision has been that there be, in the municipality of San Juan, where the country's general interests are represented, an indirect intervention by the collective will of the people, in some specific form, by determining the style in which its government shall be constituted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>***</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>\"If we think, Mr. Chairman, that the general fund of the country has to invest here copious amounts of money for the port development, that belongs to all of Puerto Rico, for the University facilities which belong to all of Puerto Rico, for the large traffic arteries needed for the economic progress of this country, for banking, for industry, for the moving control of this country throughout the developing process and growth thereof, and its life itself, there are sufficient reasons to have a voice from all the Puerto Rican citizenry, even though tinily represented, to be heard in regard to the manner in which the San Juan municipality is governed.\"  Diario de</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Sesiones, Vol. XIII, Tomo 4, p. 1715.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The long history of the various types of government under which San Juan has been administered is indicative of the concerns of the Puerto Rican legislature that affairs of the capital be conducted to reflect the will of all Puerto Ricans because of the role played by that city in all aspects of life in the Commonwealth.
