CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n                         OPINION\n\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge:\n\n    The eight plaintiffs in this case were all present at a\nmusical event and fundraiser held in a downtown Los\nAngeles warehouse on November 16, 2008. During the\nevent, several officers of the Los Angeles Police Department\n(LAPD), who were looking for suspects who had stolen beer\nfrom a nearby convenience store, entered the warehouse\nwithout a warrant, rounded up the attendees, searched them\nfor weapons, and required them to participate in a field show-\nup with a witness to the beer theft. A number of\nattendees—including two of the plaintiffs here—were\narrested for resisting the officers.\n\n    The plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nalleging that the officers’ warrantless entry into the\nwarehouse and their subsequent searching and detention of\neveryone inside violated the attendees’ First and Fourth\nAmendment rights. The district court granted summary\njudgment to the defendants with respect to the warrantless-\nentry claims, holding that no plaintiff had standing to\nchallenge the warrantless entry. It also granted summary\njudgment to the defendants with respect to the unreasonable-\nseizure claim of plaintiff Javier Cortez, which the district\ncourt held was barred by Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477\n(1994). The remainder of the claims went to a jury, which\nfound for the defendants on all counts.\n\n    We affirm the judgment below in most respects: We\nagree that the majority of the plaintiffs lack standing to\nchallenge the warrantless entry, we conclude that the district\ncourt’s holding that Cortez is subject to the Heck bar was\n\f                 LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                           5\n\ncorrect, and we reject all of the plaintiffs’ claims of error\nregarding the jury instructions given at trial. But we reverse\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment with respect\nto Cortez’s and plaintiff Elizabeth Lopez’s warrantless-entry\nclaims. Cortez and Lopez, who were organizers of the event\nand thus were in possession of the warehouse on the night of\nNovember 16, have standing to challenge the officers’ entry\ninto the warehouse.          We accordingly remand their\nwarrantless-entry claims for trial.\n\n                                    I\n\nA. The Events of November 16, 2008\n\n    In November 2008, a group of activists, including\nplaintiffs Javier Cortez and Elizabeth Lopez, organized a\n“musical and artistic event” designed to raise money for the\nupcoming Los Angeles Anarchist Book Fair. Ulises Ramirez,\nanother of the organizers, received permission from his friend\nJosh Haglund to hold the event in a warehouse in downtown\nLos Angeles that Haglund was subletting and using as an\nartistic work space.1 The event was scheduled for the night\nof November 16 and was to feature several musical\nperformers, along with artists working on screen prints and\ndrawings. The organizers publicized the event broadly\nthrough MySpace and various email lists, and approximately\n100 people attended.\n\n\n\n 1\n    Haglund was the sole sublessee listed on the sublease agreement. He\nlater testified, however, that various friends helped him pay the rent at\ntimes. Haglund gave several of these friends keys to the warehouse,\nincluding plaintiff Joseph Holliday, who paid Haglund for the right to use\nthe warehouse to construct sets for a student film.\n\f6             LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n    On the night of the event, a group of unknown persons\nallegedly stole bottles of beer from a convenience store about\na mile from the warehouse. Police dispatch put out a call\ndescribing the suspects as “six male Hispanic juveniles”\nwearing “‘rocker type’ clothing” and giving the license plate\nnumber of the pickup truck the suspects were driving. Two\nLAPD officers, Johnny Cervantes and Nicholas Cho,\nresponded to the dispatch call and, after searching the area,\nlocated the suspects’ truck parked around the corner from the\nwarehouse. The two officers determined that there appeared\nto be some kind of party going on at the warehouse, which\nwas unusual given the time of day (Sunday night), and they\nobserved people wearing what they deemed to be “rocker\ntype” clothing going inside. On this basis, Officers Cho and\nCervantes decided to investigate the warehouse.\n\n   Cortez was standing near the half-open door of the\nwarehouse as the officers approached. The officers told\nCortez that they were conducting a theft investigation and\nneeded to speak to whomever was in charge of the event.\nCortez told the officers that the event was a “private party”\nand that they could not come in unless they had a search\nwarrant. He then began backing toward the warehouse.\n\n    The officers observed that Cortez—who is Hispanic and\nwho was wearing dark clothing—matched the general\ndescription of the theft suspects and ordered him to stop.\nCortez did not comply with this order; instead, he turned and\nran into the warehouse. He then attempted to close the door,\nbut Officer Cervantes struggled with him and was able to\npush the door open. The two officers entered the warehouse,\nseeking to subdue Cortez.\n\f              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                   7\n\n    Once inside the warehouse, the officers observed Cortez\n“walking towards a large group.” They ordered Cortez\nseveral more times to stop, but he did not do so. The officers\nthen grabbed Cortez and began struggling with him. The\ncrowd around Cortez shouted at the officers to let him go and\nmoved toward the officers in what the officers described as an\n“aggressive manner.” The officers dragged Cortez toward the\ndoor, with the crowd continuing to protest. As the officers\nreached the door, they were struck in the back of the head by\na thin, light wooden partition that had been erected near the\nfront door. (It is not known whether someone intentionally\npushed over the partition or whether it simply fell by\naccident.) The impact startled the officers, but they were not\ninjured. The two made it out of the warehouse, at which\npoint Officer Cho handcuffed Cortez and took him into\ncustody while Officer Cervantes called for backup.\n\n    Several officers responded to the call for backup,\nincluding Sergeant David Ross, who took charge at the scene.\nWhen the backup officers arrived, the crowd went back inside\nthe warehouse, and James Lyall, one of the attendees, closed\nthe door with the help of another man. The police began\nspeaking to the attendees through the door, telling them to\nopen it and come out. Lyall, an attorney, responded that the\nofficers needed a warrant to come in. After a few minutes of\nback-and-forth between Lyall and the officers, Lyall broke\noff the conversation and moved away from the door. At that\npoint, a group of attendees decided they wanted to obey the\nofficers’ orders and come out of the warehouse. After this\ngroup went out the door, Sasha Costanza-Chock, another\nattendee at the event, tried to close the door behind them, but\nthe police pushed it open and ordered everyone out.\n\f8               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n    As the police began to clear out the warehouse, plaintiff\nJoseph Holliday, who was not participating in the event but\nwas present at the warehouse that evening to work on sets for\na student film, decided to go up on the roof of the warehouse\nwith his assistant “rather than get pulled out the front and get\narrested.” Once the two reached the roof, they jumped across\nto the roof of a neighboring warehouse. A police helicopter\nlocated Holliday and his companion and ordered them off the\nroof. Holliday stayed briefly on the roof to place a cell-phone\ncall to his mother but eventually complied with the order and\ncame down. Holliday and his assistant were arrested for\nresisting a peace officer; they were later released without\nbeing formally charged with any offense.\n\n    Meanwhile, Sergeant Ross lined the rest of the event\nattendees against a chain-link fence. The police then\nconducted pat-down searches of all of the attendees for\nweapons. They also conducted a “field ‘show-up’” with a\nwitness from the convenience store in an attempt to identify\nsuspects in the theft. The witness identified one person in the\nlineup, Eduardo Ramirez, and the police put Ramirez under\narrest. Several other attendees, including Cortez, were\narrested for resisting a peace officer in violation of California\nPenal Code § 148. After about 45 minutes, the police\npermitted the attendees in the line-up to leave the area.\nSergeant Ross then padlocked the warehouse door shut in\norder to secure the building.\n\n    Two days after the event, on November 18, 2008, Cortez\npleaded guilty to an infraction2 violation of California Penal\n\n\n    2\n    In California, a minor offense can be prosecuted as an “infraction”\nrather than as a misdemeanor. Cal. Penal Code § 17(d)(1). Infractions are\nnot punishable by imprisonment and are not tried to juries. Id. § 19.6.\n\f                 LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                              9\n\nCode § 415 (disturbing the peace) based on his encounter\nwith the officers. Cortez was entitled to appeal the judgment\nof conviction under California law, Cal. Penal Code\n§ 1466(b)(1), but did not do so. He later attempted to\nexpunge the conviction but was unable to do so because\nexpungement is not available for infractions. See id.\n§ 1203.4(b).\n\nB. Procedural Background\n\n    Two groups of plaintiffs represented by the same attorney\nultimately filed materially identical lawsuits against the City\nof Los Angeles, the LAPD, Chief of Police William Bratton,\nand six officers present at the scene, including Officers Ross,\nCho, and Cervantes. The plaintiffs in the first lawsuit, which\ncommenced in October 2009, were Lyall, Cortez, Costanza-\nChock, Holliday, and three additional attendees at the event:\nD’Angelo Jones, Magnolia Becerra, and Benjamin Wood.\nThe plaintiffs in the second lawsuit, which commenced in\nSeptember 2010, were Lopez and Jessica Rodriguez, an\nattendee.3 The complaint in each case stated three claims:\n(1) a § 1983 claim for violation of the plaintiffs’ First\nAmendment rights of free speech and association; (2) a\n§ 1983 claim for violation of the Fourth Amendment, based\non the officers’ warrantless entry into the warehouse, their\narrest of several of the plaintiffs, the pat-down searches of the\nplaintiffs, and the plaintiffs’ detention in the field show-up;\n\n\n 3\n   The plaintiffs sued as representatives of a class consisting of all of the\n100 attendees at the event, but the district court denied their motion for\nclass certification on the grounds that their class definition was inadequate\nand that the class members’ warrantless-entry claims presented\nindividualized questions of law not susceptible to a “blanket\ndetermination.” Plaintiffs have not appealed that decision.\n\f10               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nand (3) a claim under the Bane Act, a California statute that\nprovides a cause of action for persons deprived of federal or\nstate constitutional rights by “threat, intimidation, or\ncoercion.” Cal. Civ. Code § 52.1(b).\n\n    After discovery, the defendants moved for partial\nsummary judgment in the Lyall case, arguing (among other\nthings) that Cortez’s unreasonable-seizure claim was barred\nby Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), because it\nchallenged the validity of his § 415 conviction, which had not\nbeen vacated or overturned, and that the plaintiffs’ Fourth\nAmendment claims relating to the warrantless entry into the\nwarehouse failed as a matter of law because none of the\nplaintiffs had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the\nwarehouse.4 The plaintiffs cross-moved for summary\njudgment on their Fourth Amendment claims.\n\n    The district court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants on the plaintiffs’ warrantless-entry claims, holding\nthat none of the plaintiffs had a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy in the warehouse. The court determined that most of\nthe plaintiffs were simply attendees at an open, widely\npublicized event and that they had no “possessory interest, or\nany other connection to the warehouse that might reasonably\nconfer an expectation of privacy.” It then rejected Cortez’s\nargument that his status as an organizer of the event entitled\nhim to Fourth Amendment standing, explaining that “mere\n\n\n  4\n    The defendants also sought summary judgment on all claims against\nPolice Chief Bratton and two of the named officers, on the ground that\nthere was insufficient evidence for the plaintiffs to proceed against those\nthree defendants. The court granted summary judgment with respect to\nBratton and the two officers, and the plaintiffs do not appeal that\ndetermination.\n\f                LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                        11\n\npermission to use a space” for a public event did not create a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. Finally, the court\ndetermined that Holliday, despite his payments to Haglund\nfor access to the warehouse, was not a “co-tenant” there, and\nit held that even if Holliday were a co-tenant, he could assert,\nat most, a “limited possessory interest” in the warehouse that\n“would not have conferred a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy in the space on the night in question.”\n\n    The court also granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants with respect to Cortez’s unreasonable-seizure\nclaim, holding that that claim was barred by Heck because it\nchallenged the validity of his § 415 conviction, which had not\nbeen vacated, expunged, or otherwise disturbed. The court\ndeemed it irrelevant that Cortez was unable to seek habeas\nrelief due to the brevity of his time in custody, because\nCalifornia law gave Cortez a right of direct appeal from his\ninfraction conviction and he had not pursued such an appeal.\n\n    The court denied the plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary\njudgment, holding that the claims remaining in the case\ninvolved genuine issues of material fact that would need to go\nto the jury.5\n\n    Lyall and Lopez were consolidated for trial, which\noccurred in May 2013. The jury returned a verdict for the\ndefendants on all counts. It found that the plaintiffs had not\n\n\n   5\n      The district court later considered cross-motions for summary\njudgment in the Lopez case. Applying the reasoning of its Lyall summary-\njudgment order, the district court held that Lopez and Rodriguez did not\nhave standing to challenge the warrantless entry. It accordingly granted\nsummary judgment to the defendants on the warrantless-entry claims\nwhile sending the rest of the plaintiffs’ claims to trial.\n\f12              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nproven by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that any\nplaintiff had been unreasonably searched or detained, (2) that\nHolliday had been arrested without probable cause, (3) that\nany plaintiff’s First Amendment rights had been violated, or\n(4) that any defendant had intentionally interfered with any\nplaintiff’s civil rights by threats, intimidation, or coercion in\nviolation of the Bane Act. The plaintiffs timely appealed the\njudgment,6 and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                   II\n\n    The plaintiffs’ first claim on appeal is that the district\ncourt erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants\non the plaintiffs’ warrantless-entry claims. We review the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment de novo and “will\nuphold [the] summary judgment if there is no genuine dispute\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law.” Kohler v. Bed Bath & Beyond of Cal.,\nLLC, 780 F.3d 1260, 1263 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(a)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    We note at the outset that the district court analyzed the\nplaintiffs’ challenges to the warrantless entry solely under the\nreasonable-expectation-of-privacy test derived from the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S.\n347 (1967). After the district court ruled on the defendants’\nsummary-judgment motions, however, the Supreme Court\ndecided United States v. Jones, in which it considered the\nquestion whether the placement of a GPS device on a\nsuspect’s car to track the suspect’s movements on public\n\n\n\n  6\n    One plaintiff, D’Angelo Jones, elected not to appeal and is no longer\na party to this case.\n\f               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                    13\n\nstreets was a “search” subject to the Fourth Amendment’s\nwarrant requirement. 132 S. Ct. 945 (2012).\n\n    The government in Jones argued that no search had\noccurred because a person has no reasonable expectation of\nprivacy in the movement of his car over public streets, but the\nCourt declined even to consider that argument. Id. at 950.\nThe Court instead cited to the Fourth Amendment’s\nprotection of “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their\npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures,” and held that physically trespassing\nto place a GPS device on one of the suspect’s “effects”—i.e.,\nhis car—was a search requiring a warrant. Id. at 949. The\nSupreme Court held that the reasonable-expectation-of-\nprivacy test from Katz is not the exclusive metric by which\ncourts should determine whether a Fourth Amendment\n“search” has occurred. See id. at 950 (stating that a person’s\n“Fourth Amendment rights do not rise or fall with the Katz\nformulation”). Rather, “the Katz reasonable-expectation-of-\nprivacy test has been added to, not substituted for, the\ncommon-law trespassory test.” Id. at 952; see Soldal v. Cook\nCnty., 506 U.S. 56, 62–64 (1992) (“[O]ur cases unmistakably\nhold that the [Fourth] Amendment protects property as well\nas privacy. . . . [T]he message of . . . cases [like Katz] is that\nproperty rights are not the sole measure of Fourth\nAmendment violations.”).\n\n    Jones simply reaffirmed that when the government\n“physically occupie[s] private property for the purpose of\nobtaining information,” a Fourth Amendment search occurs,\nregardless whether the intrusion violated any reasonable\nexpectation of privacy. 132 S. Ct. at 949; see also, e.g.,\nGrady v. North Carolina, 135 S. Ct. 1368, 1370 (2015) (per\ncuriam) (applying Jones and holding that the attachment of a\n\f14               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nGPS tracking device to a person’s body was a search);\nFlorida v. Jardines, 133 S. Ct. 1409, 1417 (2013) (applying\nJones and holding that the use of police dogs to investigate\nthe curtilage of a home was a search). Only where the search\ndid not involve a physical trespass do courts need to consult\nKatz’s reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test. See Jones,\n132 S. Ct. at 953.\n\n    But even if a trespassory search occurred, that does not\nend our inquiry. Jones did not change the fundamental tenet\nthat “Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights which,\nlike some other constitutional rights, may not be vicariously\nasserted.” Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 174\n(1969). “In order to qualify as a ‘person aggrieved by an\nunlawful search and seizure’ one must have been a victim of\na search or seizure, one against whom the search was\ndirected, as distinguished from one who claims prejudice only\nthrough the use of evidence gathered as a consequence of a\nsearch or seizure directed at someone else.” Id. at 173\n(quoting Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 261 (1960)).\nIn other words, when police trespass on property to carry out\na search, a defendant has standing to raise the Fourth\nAmendment only if it was his person, house, paper, or effect\nsearched. The Court in Jones did not discuss standing for a\nsimple reason: There, no one disputed that Jones lawfully\npossessed the car that the officers trespassed on during their\nsearch. Jones, 132 S. Ct. at 949 n.2. After Jones, even when\nofficers carry out a common-law trespassory search, the\nquestion remains: Whose Fourth Amendment rights were\nviolated?7\n\n\n   7\n     In addition to challenging the warrantless entry under the Fourth\nAmendment, the plaintiffs allege that the entry violated their rights under\nArticle I, Section 13 of the California Constitution, which contains\n\f                 LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                             15\n\n    The Fourth Amendment shields not only actual owners,\nbut also anyone with sufficient possessory rights over the\nproperty searched. Our own cases have thoroughly discussed\nwhat types of possessory rights create standing under the\nFourth Amendment. See, e.g., United States v.

See United States v. Lockett,\n919 F.2d 585, 588 (9th Cir. 1990) (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S.\n128, 143 (1978) (holding that Fourth Amendment standing\ncannot be conferred merely because a person is “legitimately\non the premises” (brackets omitted)); United States v. Johns,\n\n\nlanguage virtually identical to that of the Fourth Amendment. Cal. Const.\nart. I, § 13. But the plaintiffs have failed to cite any authority for the\nproposition that Article I, Section 13 provides greater protection against\nsearches and seizures than the Fourth Amendment. We have held that it\ndoes not. Sanchez v. Cnty. of San Diego, 464 F.3d 916, 928–29 (9th Cir.\n2006) (“[T]he right to be free from unreasonable searches under [Article\nI, Section 13] parallels the Fourth Amendment inquiry.”). We will\ntherefore analyze the lawfulness of the warrantless entry solely under the\nFourth Amendment.\n  8\n     In these cases, we essentially conflated the trespassory-search and\nreasonable-expectation-of-privacy tests for Fourth Amendment standing.\nThat is, we required a sufficient possessory interest in property in order for\nthe defendant to have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the property.\nSee Thomas, 447 F.3d at 1198–99; Cormier, 220 F.3d at 1108. In light of\nJones, we recognize that the two tests for Fourth Amendment standing are\nseparate and that a person may have Fourth Amendment standing to\nchallenge a search based on his possessory interest in property\nindependent of any reasonable expectation of privacy in the property.\nNevertheless, we believe these cases are useful for determining the types\nof possessory interests that grant a person standing to challenge a search.\n\f16             LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n851 F.2d 1131, 1136 (9th Cir. 1988) (person had standing\nbecause he had joint “control” over storage unit). For\nexample, where a defendant not only has the right to possess\na location, but also the right to exclude others, he likely has\nFourth Amendment standing to challenge searches there. See\nRakas, 439 U.S. at 149 (holding that a defendant with\npermission to ride in a car did not have standing to challenge\na search, and distinguishing a case where a defendant “not\nonly had permission to use the [location searched] . . . but . . .\nhad complete dominion and control over the [location] and\ncould exclude others from it”).\n\n    For purposes of our analysis, we divide the plaintiffs into\nthree groups: (1) the five plaintiffs who were merely\nattending the event, (2) Joseph Holliday, who paid Haglund\nfor the right to work on film sets in the warehouse, and\n(3) Cortez and Lopez, who organized the event and received\npermission from Haglund to use the warehouse.\n\nA. Event Attendees (Lyall, Costanza-Chock, Becerra, Wood,\n   and Rodriguez)\n\n    The officers’ warrantless entry into the warehouse did not\ninfringe any protected Fourth Amendment interest of the\nplaintiffs who were merely attending the event, whether\nconsidered under either the Jones trespass test or Katz’s\nreasonable-expectation-of-privacy test.\n\n    These five plaintiffs have not asserted any ownership\ninterests in the places searched, so they must rely on Katz’s\n\f                 LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                            17\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy framework.9 And they\nhave no grounds on which to claim a reasonable expectation\nof privacy in the warehouse. They happened to be inside the\nwarehouse when the police entered, but that fact, without\nmore, is insufficient to confer Fourth Amendment standing.\nSee Rakas, 439 U.S. at 135, 141–43 (holding that the mere\nfact that a person is “legitimately on premises where a search\noccurs” is not enough to show that the search infringed the\nperson’s expectation of privacy); United States v. Armenta,\n69 F.3d 304, 309 (9th Cir. 1995) (evidence suggesting, at\nmost, that defendant was legitimately on the premises\n\n   9\n     Although courts of appeals do not appear to have taken up the\nownership question since Jones, the Court there instructed that we should\napply the common-law trespass theory as it has always existed—which\nrequires a sufficient possessory interest in the property beyond mere\npermission to remain on the property searched. The district courts that\nhave addressed this question post-Jones take the same view that a\nsufficient ownership interest is required to confer standing. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Houseal, No. 3:11CR-143-H, 2014 WL 626765, at *6\n(W.D. Ky. Feb. 18, 2014) (“[A] defendant who does not have either a\nlawful ownership interest, or a possessory interest in [property] at the time\nof the search does not possess a legitimate expectation of privacy that the\nFourth Amendment will protect.”); United States v. Figueroa-Cruz, 914\nF. Supp. 2d 1250, 1261–62 (N.D. Ala. 2012) (“Under the reasonable\nexpectation of privacy test ownership, and presumably a legal bailment[,]\nwhile perhaps factors to be considered, are not dispositive. . . .

Hanna, No. 11-20678-CR, 2012 WL 279435, at *3\n(S.D. Fla. Jan. 30, 2012) (“Under . . .

CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nsearched was “insufficient to demonstrate a legitimate\nexpectation of privacy”).\n\nB. Joseph Holliday\n\n    Joseph Holliday’s claim to a protected Fourth\nAmendment interest in the warehouse is stronger than that of\na mere attendee at the November 16 event. Holliday was\nmaking regular payments to Haglund, the subtenant of the\nwarehouse, so Holliday could use the warehouse to construct\nfilm sets. Holliday argues that this arrangement made him a\n“co-tenant” of the warehouse with a reasonable expectation\nof privacy and a property interest therein.\n\n    We hold that Holliday had neither sufficient possessory\nrights, nor a reasonable expectation of privacy, in the\nwarehouse. First, Holliday has insufficient possessory rights\nto raise Fourth Amendment concerns. He was not in\npossession of the warehouse on the night of November 16; he\nhad moved his film sets out of the way to allow the space to\nbe used for the event, and he was there solely as an attendee.\nHaglund referred to Holliday as simply one of several\n“friends of mine who have helped pay the rent” and to whom\nhe had given keys. He told Holliday at the outset of their\nrelationship that others would be given access to the\nwarehouse and that Holliday would need to “make room” for\nthem as circumstances warranted. And most importantly,\nHolliday did not have the right to exclude others from any\nportion of the warehouse. Tellingly, Holliday stated in his\ndeposition that he did not feel that his permission was\nrequired before the November 16 event could be held.\nNothing about Holliday’s arrangement with Haglund\n“indicates joint control and supervision” of the warehouse.\n\f               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                      19\n\n    For the same reasons, we likewise hold that Holliday\ncannot prevail under a reasonable-expectation-of-privacy\ntheory. Any expectation of privacy Holliday had in the space\nwas inextricably tied to his ownership or possessory rights\nover the areas searched. See, e.g., United States v. Nohara,\n3 F.3d 1239, 1242 (9th Cir. 1993). And as explained above,\nhe did not possess such rights when the officers conducted\ntheir search.\n\nC. Event Organizers (Cortez and Lopez)\n\n    We part ways with the district court with respect to Cortez\nand Lopez—the two plaintiffs who were present at the\nNovember 16 event not as attendees but as organizers.\nCortez and Lopez have standing to challenge the officers’\nwarrantless entry under Jones, and the district court therefore\nerred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on\ntheir warrantless-entry claims.\n\n    Unlike the attendees at the event, Cortez, Lopez, and the\nother organizers of the event were not “mere visitors,” as the\ndefendants claim; they had received permission from\nHaglund to use the warehouse on November 16 and were in\ncharge of the property that night. The organizers had\npossession of the warehouse, the right to control it, and the\nright to bring an action in trespass against intruders.10 See\nSmith v. Cap Concrete Inc., 184 Cal. Rptr. 308, 310 (Ct. App.\n1982) (“The cause of action for trespass is designed to protect\npossessory—not necessarily ownership—interests in land\nfrom unlawful interference. The proper plaintiff in an action\n\n\n  10\n    Haglund did not charge the organizers money for their use of the\nspace, but that is an irrelevant fortuity. It does not diminish the\norganizers’ right to exclude others from the warehouse.\n\f20             LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nfor trespass to real property is the person in actual possession\n. . . .” (citations omitted)). After Cortez impeded Officers\nCho and Cervantes at the warehouse door and objected to\ntheir presence, the officers’ entry into the warehouse was\ntrespassory, thereby implicating Jones. See Thomas,\n447 F.3d at 1199 (holding that an unauthorized driver of a\nrental car may have standing to challenge a search of the\nvehicle if he has permission to use the car from the authorized\ndriver); see also Jones, 362 U.S. at 259, 265–67 (holding\nJones had standing to challenge a search of his friend’s\napartment when the friend gave him use of the apartment and\na key).\n\n    The defendants argue that, even if Cortez and Lopez (or\nany other plaintiff) can show that they had a protected Fourth\nAmendment interest in the warehouse, we can affirm the\ngrant of summary judgment on the ground that the entry was\njustified by exigent circumstances. We disagree. In a § 1983\ncase, the question whether exigent circumstances existed is\ngenerally one for the jury. See, e.g., Fisher v. City of San\nJose, 558 F.3d 1069, 1071 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc); Hancock\nv. Dodson, 958 F.2d 1367, 1375 (6th Cir. 1992) (“In a civil\n[§ 1983] action, the determination of whether exigent\ncircumstances exist is properly resolved by the jury.”). We\ncan affirm the judgment, therefore, only if “the underlying\nfacts are essentially undisputed, and . . . a finder of fact could\nreach but one conclusion as to the existence of exigent\ncircumstances.” Hancock, 958 F.2d at 1375.\n\n    In this case, a trier of fact could easily conclude that no\nexigent circumstances existed to justify the warrantless entry.\nWe have held that “while the commission of a misdemeanor\noffense,” such as the petty theft that Officers Cho and\nCervantes were investigating, “is not to be taken lightly, it\n\f              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                  21\n\nmilitates against a finding of exigent circumstances where the\noffense . . . is not inherently dangerous.” United States v.\nStruckman, 603 F.3d 731, 745 (9th Cir. 2010). A jury could\nthus decide that the officers’ search for the suspects in the\nbeer theft—who police were not even sure were in the\nwarehouse—did not justify a warrantless entry. Similarly, a\njury could conclude that Cortez’s behavior toward the officers\ndid not justify entering the warehouse without a warrant to\napprehend him. Any crime Cortez had committed was minor,\nand there was little chance that he would flee or destroy\nevidence.\n\n    We therefore cannot hold as a matter of law that exigent\ncircumstances justified the officers’ warrantless entry. The\nquestion of exigent circumstances should be put to the trier of\nfact on remand.\n\n                           * * *\n\n    Because Cortez’s and Lopez’s possessory interest in the\nwarehouse on the night of November 16 gave them standing\nto challenge the warrantless entry under Jones, the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to the defendants on\nCortez’s and Lopez’s warrantless-entry claims was error,\nregardless whether they had a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy in the warehouse—a question we do not decide. See\nJardines, 133 S. Ct. at 1417 (“One virtue of the Fourth\nAmendment’s property-rights baseline is that it keeps easy\ncases easy. That the officers . . . physically intrud[ed] on [a\nperson’s] property to gather evidence is enough to establish\nthat a search occurred.”). We accordingly reverse the grant\nof summary judgment as to Cortez and Lopez and remand\ntheir warrantless-entry claims for further proceedings. We\n\f22              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\naffirm the grant of summary judgment as to the other\nplaintiffs’ warrantless-entry claims.\n\n                                  III\n\n    We next consider Cortez’s argument that the district court\nerred in concluding that Heck v. Humphrey bars him from\nchallenging his unreasonable seizure by the police under\n§ 1983. We agree with the district court that the Heck bar\napplies.\n\n    In Heck, the Supreme Court considered the question\nwhether a state prisoner could challenge his conviction by\nbringing a § 1983 suit based on allegedly unconstitutional\nacts committed by state actors during his arrest and\nprosecution. Heck, 512 U.S. at 478–79. The Court concluded\nthat such a claim was not cognizable under § 1983 because\ntort lawsuits generally “are not appropriate vehicles for\nchallenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments.”\nId. at 486. The Court therefore held that “in order to recover\ndamages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or\nimprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose\nunlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,\na § 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence\nhas been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive\norder, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make\nsuch determination, or called into question by a federal\ncourt’s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.” Id. at 486–87\n(footnote omitted).11\n\n\n\n  11\n    Whether the Heck bar applies may also turn on whether a plaintiff’s\n§ 1983 claim undermines the prior conviction in question. Because the\nparties have not argued this issue on appeal, we do not reach it.\n\f              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                    23\n\n    Four years later, in Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1 (1998),\nfive Justices of the Court suggested that Heck’s scope might\nbe narrower than Heck itself indicated. In Spencer, an inmate\nwas released on parole but then had his parole revoked.\nWhen he returned to prison, the inmate first challenged the\nparole revocation in the state courts and then, when that\nchallenge was unsuccessful, filed a federal habeas petition.\nBefore the federal district court could rule on the petition, the\ninmate completed his term of imprisonment and was released\nagain. Id. at 5–6. The district court thus dismissed the\nhabeas petition as moot.\n\n    The Court held that the habeas petition was indeed moot\nand had to be dismissed. In his opinion for the majority,\nJustice Scalia rejected the inmate’s argument that his habeas\npetition should not be considered moot because he needed to\nobtain habeas relief as a prerequisite to pursuing a § 1983\naction. The majority described this as “a great non sequitur,\nunless one believes (as we do not) that a § 1983 action for\ndamages must always and everywhere be available.” Id. at\n17.\n\n     Justice Souter, however, wrote a concurrence joined by\nthree other Justices, in which he argued that the petitioner\nwas not, in fact, barred by Heck from suing about his parole\nrevocation under § 1983. He explained that Heck had not\nmade favorable termination of criminal proceedings “an\nelement of any § 1983 action alleging unconstitutional\nconviction”; rather, Heck’s rule applied only to prisoners “in\ncustody” to whom habeas was available, because the Court\nhad adopted the Heck rule in order to prevent a conflict\nbetween the habeas statute and § 1983. Id. at 19–20 (Souter,\nJ., concurring). Thus, Justice Souter concluded, “a former\nprisoner, no longer ‘in custody,’ may bring a § 1983 action\n\f24            LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nestablishing the unconstitutionality of a conviction or\nconfinement without being bound to satisfy a\nfavorable-termination requirement that it would be\nimpossible as a matter of law for him to satisfy,” because\nafter a prisoner is released, “the habeas statute and its\nexhaustion requirement have nothing to do with his right to\nany relief.” Id. at 21.\n\n    Justice Stevens dissented in Spencer, arguing that the\npetitioner’s habeas petition was not moot. In a footnote,\nhowever, he agreed with Justice Souter’s view of Heck,\nstating that “it is perfectly clear, as Justice Souter explains,\nthat [the petitioner] may bring an action under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983.” Id. at 25 n.8 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In total,\ntherefore, five Justices on the Spencer Court took the position\nthat the Heck bar does not necessarily apply to a person who\nis unable to challenge his conviction by way of federal\nhabeas.\n\n    We have looked to the separate Spencer opinions for\nguidance as to whether Heck’s favorable-termination\nrequirement applies in all § 1983 cases and have concluded\nthat, at least sometimes, it does not. Two cases, Nonnette v.\nSmall, 316 F.3d 872 (9th Cir. 2002), and Guerrero v. Gates,\n442 F.3d 697 (9th Cir. 2006), define the rough boundaries of\nthe Heck bar, as we have construed it post-Spencer. In\nNonnette, a state prisoner, after first exhausting his prison\nadministrative remedies, brought a § 1983 suit against prison\nofficials, alleging that they wrongly revoked some of his\ngood-time credits and placed him in administrative\nsegregation without giving him adequate process. The\ndistrict court held that his § 1983 action was barred by Heck.\nBy the time we heard his appeal, however, the inmate had\nbeen released. We held that because any habeas corpus\n\f              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                    25\n\npetition filed by the now-former inmate would be dismissed\nas moot, he was not barred by Heck from bringing a § 1983\nsuit. Nonnette, 316 F.3d at 877. We stated that this holding\n“affects only former prisoners challenging loss of good-time\ncredits, revocation of parole or similar matters; the status of\nprisoners challenging their underlying convictions or\nsentences does not change upon release, because they\ncontinue to be able to petition for a writ of habeas corpus.”\nId. at 878 n.7.\n\n    In Guerrero, decided four years later, we distinguished\nNonnette and concluded that an ex-inmate’s § 1983 suit was\nbarred by Heck. The plaintiff in Guerrero alleged that\nvarious LAPD officials had conspired to subject him to\nexcessive force, wrongful arrest, and malicious prosecution.\nGuerrero, 442 F.3d at 702. He did not file suit until\napproximately a year after his release from prison. Id.\nExamining our previous decisions, we determined that\n“timely pursuit of available habeas relief” is an important\nprerequisite for a § 1983 plaintiff seeking to escape the Heck\nbar. Id. at 705. Thus, we explained, the plaintiff in Nonnette\ndeserved relief from the Heck bar because he “immediately\npursued relief after the incident giving rise to [his] claims and\ncould not seek habeas relief only because of the shortness of\nhis prison sentence.” Id. Guerrero, by contrast, never\nchallenged his convictions prior to filing his § 1983 suit,\ndespite having years in custody in which to do so. We held\nthat this “self-imposed” failure to seek habeas relief was not\na ground for allowing Guerrero to escape the Heck bar.\n\f26               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n    Cortez’s case is more akin to Guerrero than to Nonnette.12\nCortez does not come within the narrow exception recognized\nin Spencer and Nonnette. Nonnette’s relief from Heck\n“‘affects only former prisoners challenging loss of good-time\ncredits, revocation of parole or similar matters,’ not\nchallenges to an underlying conviction.” Id. (quoting\nNonnette, 316 F.3d at 878 n.7). We are not an alternative\nforum for challenging his conviction. We therefore affirm\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\ndefendants with respect to Cortez’s unreasonable-seizure\nclaim.\n\n                                    IV\n\n    Finally, we turn to the plaintiffs’ four claims of error\nrelating to the jury instructions given at trial. None of these\nclaims has merit.\n\nA. Plaintiffs’ Requested Instructions on the Lawfulness of\n   their Search and Seizure and of the Officers’ Orders\n\n    After the close of the evidence, the plaintiffs requested\nthat the district court instruct the jury that the officers’ search\n\n\n 12\n     We acknowledge that Cortez’s inability to obtain federal habeas relief\nis no fault of his own: He was in custody for only two days after his arrest\nand was not sentenced to any prison time as a result of his infraction\nconviction. The brevity of Cortez’s time in custody made federal habeas\neffectively unavailable to him. But Cortez failed to exercise his right,\nunder California law, to a direct appeal from his conviction. See Cal.\nPenal Code § 1466(b)(1). Cortez’s success in his § 1983 suit would imply\nthat his conviction in California was wrongly obtained. Yet his conviction\nhas never been invalidated. Indeed, Cortez has never sought to invalidate\nit through direct appeal or post-conviction relief. He is thus barred by\nHeck.\n\f              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                  27\n\nof the plaintiffs for weapons and the plaintiffs’ detention\nduring the field show-up were unlawful. In pertinent part, the\nproposed instruction read:\n\n       I instruct you that each plaintiff was seized\n       and subjected to a search within the meaning\n       of the Fourth Amendment. I further instruct\n       you that the detention and search of each\n       plaintiff was in violation of the Fourth\n       Amendment.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ request for this instruction was the equivalent\nof a motion for judgment as a matter of law, given that the\ninstruction would have compelled the jury to decide for the\nplaintiffs on the ultimate issue in the case (i.e., whether the\nofficers’ conduct was reasonable). Cf. Jack Cole Co. v.\nHudson, 409 F.2d 188, 191 (5th Cir. 1969) (defendants’\nmidtrial “request in chambers that the jury be instructed to\nfind for them” was the equivalent of a motion for a directed\nverdict). We therefore review the district court’s refusal to\ngive the instruction under the standard that applies to the\ndenial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law: We will\nnot reverse the district court unless “the evidence permit[ted]\na reasonable jury to reach only one conclusion.” Quiksilver,\nInc. v. Kymsta Corp., 466 F.3d 749, 755 (9th Cir. 2006)\n(quoting Lawson v. Umatilla Cnty., 139 F.3d 690, 692 (9th\nCir. 1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id.\n(“If reasonable minds could differ as to the import of the\nevidence, . . . judgment as a matter of law should not be\ngranted.” (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n242, 250–51 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n   Based on the evidence presented at trial, a reasonable jury\ncould find that the officers acted permissibly when they\n\f28               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nsearched the plaintiffs and detained them for the field show-\nup. The theft suspects’ car had been seen in close proximity\nto the warehouse, suggesting that the suspects might have\ntaken refuge inside. Cortez matched the theft suspects’\ndescription and behaved suspiciously toward the officers\nwhen they questioned him. The officers testified that the\ncrowd reacted angrily when they attempted to subdue Cortez\nand that they believed they were in danger—a belief that was\nexacerbated when the wooden partition, which they thought\nsomeone had pushed, fell on top of them. It was reasonable\nfor the jury to conclude, in light of this testimony, that the\nofficers had sufficient fear for their own safety to justify\nsearching the plaintiffs for weapons, see Terry v. Ohio,\n392 U.S. 1, 27 (1968), and sufficient reason to believe that\nsuspects in the theft were among the attendees to warrant\nholding the field show-up. The district court thus properly\nrefused to instruct the jury to find that the searches and\nseizures of the plaintiffs were unreasonable as a matter of\nlaw.13\n\n\n 13\n    The plaintiffs argue that, even if the evidence supported a finding that\nthe officers had the reasonable suspicion for seizing and frisking the\nplaintiffs required by Terry, the length of the field show-up (30–45\nminutes) transformed their detention from a Terry stop into an arrest\nrequiring a more demanding showing of probable cause. We disagree.\nThere is “no bright line rule for determining when an investigatory [Terry]\nstop crosses the line and becomes an arrest”; rather, “whether an arrest has\noccurred depends on all the surrounding circumstances, and each case\nmust be decided on its own facts.” Allen v. City of L.A., 66 F.3d 1052,\n1056 (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v. Parr, 843 F.2d 1228, 1231\n(9th Cir. 1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court\nhas indicated, moreover, that “[i]f the purpose underlying a Terry\nstop—investigating possible criminal activity—is to be served, the police\nmust under certain circumstances be able to detain the individual for\nlonger than the brief time period involved in Terry,” and that one such\ncircumstance is that “‘[i]f it is known that an offense has occurred in the\n\f                 LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                          29\n\n    The plaintiffs separately challenge the district court’s\nrefusal to give a special instruction stating that “the officers’\norders that the officers be allowed to enter and search the\npremises, and that the plaintiffs had to submit to detentions\nand searches, were unlawful as a matter of law.” Given that\nthe lawfulness of the searches and seizures themselves was a\nquestion for the jury, it follows that the lawfulness of the\nofficers’ orders regarding the searches and seizures was also\na jury question. The district court did not err by refusing to\ngive this instruction.\n\nB. Plaintiffs’ Requested Instruction on “Individualized\n   Suspicion”\n\n    At trial, the plaintiffs contended that the searches and\nseizures that occurred after they were ordered out of the\nwarehouse were unlawful because the police did not have\nreasonable suspicion that any particular member of the crowd\nwas armed or was a suspect in the crime. The plaintiffs\nrequested that the district court instruct the jury that:\n\n         Defendants were obligated to have\n         individualized suspicion as to each plaintiff\n         whom you find was detained or searched or\n         arrested. Put differently, for each plaintiff\n         you find was detained and/or searched and/or\n\n\narea, the suspect may be viewed by witnesses to the crime.’” Michigan\nv. Summers, 452 U.S. 692, 700 n.12 (1981) (quoting 3 Wayne LaFave,\nSearch and Seizure § 9.2 (1978)); see also United States v. Sharpe,\n470 U.S. 675, 685 (1985) (“[O]ur cases impose no rigid time limitation on\nTerry stops.”). The jury thus was permitted to conclude that the detaining\nof the plaintiffs for the field show-up was within the permissible scope of\nthe Terry encounter and hence lawful on a showing of reasonable\nsuspicion, rather than probable cause.\n\f30            LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n        arrested, defendants must present at least\n        some evidence that that plaintiff was observed\n        or reported to have had involvement in the\n        purported criminal activity at issue.\n\n    The district court rejected the plaintiffs’ instruction,\nopting instead to instruct the jury that:\n\n            In order to prove the seizure in this case\n        was unreasonable, plaintiffs must prove by a\n        preponderance of the evidence that the officer\n        or officers lacked reasonable suspicion to\n        detain him or her or that the length and scope\n        of the detention was excessive.\n\n            ....\n\n            The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment\n        is reasonableness. The Fourth Amendment\n        imposes no irreducible requirement of\n        individualized suspicion. Such suspicion is\n        not needed, for example, in cases involving an\n        exigency that justifies immediate action on\n        the police’s part.\n\nWe review de novo whether the district court’s instruction\nmisstated the law. Dream Games of Ariz., Inc. v. PC Onsite,\n561 F.3d 983, 988 (9th Cir. 2009).\n\n    It did not. The plaintiffs are, of course, correct that “[a]\nsearch or seizure is ordinarily unreasonable in the absence of\nindividualized suspicion of wrongdoing.”               City of\nIndianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 37 (2000). But\nalthough “some quantum of individualized suspicion is\n\f               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                     31\n\nusually a prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure . . .\nthe Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement\nof such suspicion.” United States v. Martinez-Fuerte,\n428 U.S. 543, 560–61 (1976). Thus, the fact that the officers’\nreasonable suspicion of wrongdoing is not particularized to\neach member of a group of individuals present at the same\nlocation does not automatically mean that a search of the\npeople in the group is unlawful. Rather, the trier of fact must\ndecide whether the search was reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances.\n\n    Other courts have acknowledged that police officers can\nhave reasonable suspicion to search, or even probable cause\nto arrest, a group or crowd of people without individualized\nsuspicion as to each person in the group. For example, in\nCarr v. District of Columbia, 587 F.3d 401 (D.C. Cir. 2009),\na group of persons arrested in a protest march sued under\n§ 1983, alleging that they were arrested without probable\ncause. They argued that the government was required to\nprove that the police possessed probable cause to believe that\neach individual person arrested was engaged in the crime of\nrioting. Id. at 406. But the D.C. Circuit rejected that\nargument, stating that it would impose “an impossible\nburden” on police and holding that “[p]olice witnesses must\nonly be able to form a reasonable belief that the entire crowd\nis acting as a unit and therefore all members of the crowd\nviolated the law.” Id. at 408.\n\n    We therefore agree with the district court that the\ndefendants in this case were not required to have\nindividualized suspicion with respect to each plaintiff in order\nto have reasonable suspicion to search and detain them. To\nbe sure, the fact that the officers did not see specific plaintiffs\nwith weapons or engaging in violent behavior, and that many\n\f32            LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nof the plaintiffs did not match the police call’s description of\nthe suspects as “male Hispanic juveniles,” bore on the\nquestion whether the searches and seizures were reasonable.\nStanding alone, however, the officers’ lack of individualized\nsuspicion did not make the searches and seizures unlawful.\n\n    Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85 (1979), is not to the\ncontrary. In Ybarra, the police received a tip from an\ninformant that “Greg,” a bartender at a certain tavern,\npossessed heroin and would have some for sale at the tavern\non a particular date. On the basis of the tip, the police\nobtained a warrant to search the tavern and Greg’s person for\nheroin and other contraband. Id. at 87–88. When the police\narrived at the tavern to execute the warrant, they announced\nupon entering that they would be conducting a “cursory\nsearch for weapons” of each of the nine to thirteen customers\nin the tavern. One of the officers frisked Ybarra, a patron in\nthe tavern, and felt a cigarette pack in Ybarra’s pocket during\nthe frisk; a few minutes later, he frisked Ybarra again, took\nthe pack out of his pocket, and found six packets of heroin\ninside. Ybarra was subsequently indicted for, and convicted\nof, possession of heroin. Id. at 88–89.\n\n    The Supreme Court held that the search violated Ybarra’s\nFourth Amendment rights. The Court explained the police\nlacked probable cause to believe that Ybarra was committing\nany crime: “Ybarra made no gestures indicative of criminal\nconduct, made no movements that might suggest an attempt\nto conceal contraband, and said nothing of a suspicious nature\nto the police officers.” Id. at 91. Indeed, the only thing the\npolice officers knew about Ybarra was that he was “present,\nalong with several other customers, in a public tavern at a\ntime when the police had reason to believe that the bartender\nwould have heroin for sale.” Id. The Court deemed this fact\n\f               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                    33\n\ninsufficient to give the police probable cause to believe that\nYbarra was committing a crime. The Court went on to hold\nthat the initial search could not be upheld as a reasonable\nTerry frisk, because Ybarra had done nothing to indicate to\nthe police that he was armed and dangerous. Id. at 93–94.\n\n    Ybarra stands for the proposition that, if a person is\nsimply present in the vicinity of potential criminal activity,\nwithout doing anything else to indicate that he is engaging in\ncriminal activity or that he is armed and dangerous, the police\ndo not have probable cause to search him or reasonable\nsuspicion sufficient to detain him and frisk him for weapons.\nYbarra does not, however, imply that the police can never\npossess reasonable suspicion or probable cause unless it is\nindividualized. If a group or crowd of people is behaving as\na unit and it is not possible (as it was in Ybarra) for the police\nto tell who is armed and dangerous or engaging in criminal\nacts and who is not, the police can have reasonable suspicion\nas to the members of the group. Thus, the district court’s\ninstruction did not conflict with Ybarra.\n\nC. The Court’s Instruction on the Elements of the Bane Act\n\n    Finally, the plaintiffs contend that the district court’s\ninstruction on the elements of their claim under the Bane Act\nmisstated California law in several respects. Specifically, the\nplaintiffs argue that the district court’s Bane Act instruction\nerroneously required them to prove (1) that the defendants\ninterfered with their rights “by threatening or committing\nviolent acts,” (2) that the plaintiffs believed that if they\nexercised their right to be free from unreasonable detention\nand search, “then defendants would commit violence against”\nthem; and (3) that “the [police] threats, intimidation, or\ncoercion were independent from the acts inherent in the\n\f34                LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\ndetention and search.” The plaintiffs claim that the Bane Act\ndoes not, in fact, require proof of any of these things.\n\n    We can easily dispose of the plaintiffs’ arguments about\nthe first two aspects of the district court’s Bane Act\ninstruction. The language concerning “violent acts” and the\nplaintiffs’ fear of violence closely tracks that of California’s\nmodel Bane Act instruction, CACI Instruction No. 3066,14\nwhich at least one California appellate court has approved as\na correct statement of law. See Austin B. v. Escondido Union\nSch. Dist., 57 Cal. Rptr. 3d 454, 471 (Ct. App. 2007) (quoting\nan earlier version of the same instruction). The district court\ndid not err by including these elements in its instruction.\n\n    The plaintiffs’ third objection to the district court’s Bane\nAct instruction—i.e., that it wrongly required them to show\nthreats, intimidation, or coercion independent from the acts\ninherent in their detention and search—likewise lacks merit.\nNumerous California decisions make clear that a plaintiff in\na search-and-seizure case must allege threats or coercion\nbeyond the coercion inherent in a detention or search in order\nto recover under the Bane Act. See, e.g., Allen v. City of\nSacramento, 183 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654, 678 (Ct. App. 2015)\n(“[A] wrongful arrest or detention, without more, does not\nsatisfy both elements of [the Bane Act].”); Quezada v. City of\nL.A., 166 Cal. Rptr. 3d 479, 491 (Ct. App. 2014) (“The\ncoercion inherent in detention is insufficient to show a Bane\nAct violation.”); Shoyoye v. Cnty. of L.A., 137 Cal. Rptr. 3d\n839, 849 (Ct. App. 2012) (“The [Bane Act] requires a\nshowing of coercion independent from the coercion inherent\nin the wrongful detention itself.”).\n\n\n 14\n      See Judicial Council of Cal., 2 Civil Jury Instructions 240 (2011).\n\f              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                  35\n\n    The plaintiffs cite two search-and-seizure cases in which,\nthey argue, California courts held that a plaintiff can state a\nBane Act claim without a showing of independent threats,\ncoercion, or intimidation, but neither citation supports their\nposition. In Venegas v. County of Los Angeles, 87 P.3d 1,\n13–14 (Cal. 2004), the California Supreme Court decided\nonly that a plaintiff need not allege that a defendant acted\nwith “discriminatory animus” in order to state a Bane Act\nclaim; the court did not otherwise address what elements the\nBane Act requires a plaintiff to prove. See Allen, 183 Cal.\nRptr. 3d at 676 (“[T]he only issue the Supreme Court\nconsidered [in Venegas] was whether [the Bane Act] required\na showing that the defendants acted with discriminatory\nanimus.”). And in Bender v. County of Los Angeles, 159 Cal.\nRptr. 3d 204 (Ct. App. 2013), an unlawful-arrest and\nexcessive-force case, the Court of Appeal expressly declined\nto rule on whether the Bane Act required coercion beyond the\ncoercion inherent in any arrest; it held only that “[w]here, as\nhere, an arrest is unlawful and excessive force is applied in\nmaking the arrest, there has been coercion ‘independent from\nthe coercion inherent in the wrongful detention itself’—a\nviolation of the Bane Act.” Id. at 213 (quoting Shoyoye,\n137 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 839). In short, Venegas and Bender do\nnot speak to the issue the plaintiffs raise, and they cast no\ndoubt on the correctness of the district court’s instruction.\n\n                              V\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment with respect to Javier Cortez’s\nand Elizabeth Lopez’s warrantless-entry claims, and we\n\f36          LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nremand those claims for trial. We otherwise affirm. The\nparties shall bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n  AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND\nREMANDED.\n\f",

CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n                         OPINION\n\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge:\n\n    The eight plaintiffs in this case were all present at a\nmusical event and fundraiser held in a downtown Los\nAngeles warehouse on November 16, 2008. During the\nevent, several officers of the Los Angeles Police Department\n(LAPD), who were looking for suspects who had stolen beer\nfrom a nearby convenience store, entered the warehouse\nwithout a warrant, rounded up the attendees, searched them\nfor weapons, and required them to participate in a field show-\nup with a witness to the beer theft. A number of\nattendees—including two of the plaintiffs here—were\narrested for resisting the officers.\n\n    The plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nalleging that the officers’ warrantless entry into the\nwarehouse and their subsequent searching and detention of\neveryone inside violated the attendees’ First and Fourth\nAmendment rights. The district court granted summary\njudgment to the defendants with respect to the warrantless-\nentry claims, holding that no plaintiff had standing to\nchallenge the warrantless entry. It also granted summary\njudgment to the defendants with respect to the unreasonable-\nseizure claim of plaintiff Javier Cortez, which the district\ncourt held was barred by Heck v.

The remainder of the claims went to a jury, which\nfound for the defendants on all counts.\n\n    We affirm the judgment below in most respects: We\nagree that the majority of the plaintiffs lack standing to\nchallenge the warrantless entry, we conclude that the district\ncourt’s holding that Cortez is subject to the Heck bar was\n\f                 LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                           5\n\ncorrect, and we reject all of the plaintiffs’ claims of error\nregarding the jury instructions given at trial. But we reverse\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment with respect\nto Cortez’s and plaintiff Elizabeth Lopez’s warrantless-entry\nclaims. Cortez and Lopez, who were organizers of the event\nand thus were in possession of the warehouse on the night of\nNovember 16, have standing to challenge the officers’ entry\ninto the warehouse.          We accordingly remand their\nwarrantless-entry claims for trial.\n\n                                    I\n\nA. The Events of November 16, 2008\n\n    In November 2008, a group of activists, including\nplaintiffs Javier Cortez and Elizabeth Lopez, organized a\n“musical and artistic event” designed to raise money for the\nupcoming Los Angeles Anarchist Book Fair. Ulises Ramirez,\nanother of the organizers, received permission from his friend\nJosh Haglund to hold the event in a warehouse in downtown\nLos Angeles that Haglund was subletting and using as an\nartistic work space.1 The event was scheduled for the night\nof November 16 and was to feature several musical\nperformers, along with artists working on screen prints and\ndrawings. The organizers publicized the event broadly\nthrough MySpace and various email lists, and approximately\n100 people attended.\n\n\n\n 1\n    Haglund was the sole sublessee listed on the sublease agreement. He\nlater testified, however, that various friends helped him pay the rent at\ntimes. Haglund gave several of these friends keys to the warehouse,\nincluding plaintiff Joseph Holliday, who paid Haglund for the right to use\nthe warehouse to construct sets for a student film.\n\f6             LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n    On the night of the event, a group of unknown persons\nallegedly stole bottles of beer from a convenience store about\na mile from the warehouse. Police dispatch put out a call\ndescribing the suspects as “six male Hispanic juveniles”\nwearing “‘rocker type’ clothing” and giving the license plate\nnumber of the pickup truck the suspects were driving. Two\nLAPD officers, Johnny Cervantes and Nicholas Cho,\nresponded to the dispatch call and, after searching the area,\nlocated the suspects’ truck parked around the corner from the\nwarehouse. The two officers determined that there appeared\nto be some kind of party going on at the warehouse, which\nwas unusual given the time of day (Sunday night), and they\nobserved people wearing what they deemed to be “rocker\ntype” clothing going inside. On this basis, Officers Cho and\nCervantes decided to investigate the warehouse.\n\n   Cortez was standing near the half-open door of the\nwarehouse as the officers approached. The officers told\nCortez that they were conducting a theft investigation and\nneeded to speak to whomever was in charge of the event.\nCortez told the officers that the event was a “private party”\nand that they could not come in unless they had a search\nwarrant. He then began backing toward the warehouse.\n\n    The officers observed that Cortez—who is Hispanic and\nwho was wearing dark clothing—matched the general\ndescription of the theft suspects and ordered him to stop.\nCortez did not comply with this order; instead, he turned and\nran into the warehouse. He then attempted to close the door,\nbut Officer Cervantes struggled with him and was able to\npush the door open. The two officers entered the warehouse,\nseeking to subdue Cortez.\n\f              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                   7\n\n    Once inside the warehouse, the officers observed Cortez\n“walking towards a large group.” They ordered Cortez\nseveral more times to stop, but he did not do so. The officers\nthen grabbed Cortez and began struggling with him. The\ncrowd around Cortez shouted at the officers to let him go and\nmoved toward the officers in what the officers described as an\n“aggressive manner.” The officers dragged Cortez toward the\ndoor, with the crowd continuing to protest. As the officers\nreached the door, they were struck in the back of the head by\na thin, light wooden partition that had been erected near the\nfront door. (It is not known whether someone intentionally\npushed over the partition or whether it simply fell by\naccident.) The impact startled the officers, but they were not\ninjured. The two made it out of the warehouse, at which\npoint Officer Cho handcuffed Cortez and took him into\ncustody while Officer Cervantes called for backup.\n\n    Several officers responded to the call for backup,\nincluding Sergeant David Ross, who took charge at the scene.\nWhen the backup officers arrived, the crowd went back inside\nthe warehouse, and James Lyall, one of the attendees, closed\nthe door with the help of another man. The police began\nspeaking to the attendees through the door, telling them to\nopen it and come out. Lyall, an attorney, responded that the\nofficers needed a warrant to come in. After a few minutes of\nback-and-forth between Lyall and the officers, Lyall broke\noff the conversation and moved away from the door. At that\npoint, a group of attendees decided they wanted to obey the\nofficers’ orders and come out of the warehouse. After this\ngroup went out the door, Sasha Costanza-Chock, another\nattendee at the event, tried to close the door behind them, but\nthe police pushed it open and ordered everyone out.\n\f8               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n    As the police began to clear out the warehouse, plaintiff\nJoseph Holliday, who was not participating in the event but\nwas present at the warehouse that evening to work on sets for\na student film, decided to go up on the roof of the warehouse\nwith his assistant “rather than get pulled out the front and get\narrested.” Once the two reached the roof, they jumped across\nto the roof of a neighboring warehouse. A police helicopter\nlocated Holliday and his companion and ordered them off the\nroof. Holliday stayed briefly on the roof to place a cell-phone\ncall to his mother but eventually complied with the order and\ncame down. Holliday and his assistant were arrested for\nresisting a peace officer; they were later released without\nbeing formally charged with any offense.\n\n    Meanwhile, Sergeant Ross lined the rest of the event\nattendees against a chain-link fence. The police then\nconducted pat-down searches of all of the attendees for\nweapons. They also conducted a “field ‘show-up’” with a\nwitness from the convenience store in an attempt to identify\nsuspects in the theft. The witness identified one person in the\nlineup, Eduardo Ramirez, and the police put Ramirez under\narrest. Several other attendees, including Cortez, were\narrested for resisting a peace officer in violation of California\nPenal Code § 148. After about 45 minutes, the police\npermitted the attendees in the line-up to leave the area.\nSergeant Ross then padlocked the warehouse door shut in\norder to secure the building.\n\n    Two days after the event, on November 18, 2008, Cortez\npleaded guilty to an infraction2 violation of California Penal\n\n\n    2\n    In California, a minor offense can be prosecuted as an “infraction”\nrather than as a misdemeanor.

He later attempted to\nexpunge the conviction but was unable to do so because\nexpungement is not available for infractions. See id.\n§ 1203.4(b).\n\nB. Procedural Background\n\n    Two groups of plaintiffs represented by the same attorney\nultimately filed materially identical lawsuits against the City\nof Los Angeles, the LAPD, Chief of Police William Bratton,\nand six officers present at the scene, including Officers Ross,\nCho, and Cervantes. The plaintiffs in the first lawsuit, which\ncommenced in October 2009, were Lyall, Cortez, Costanza-\nChock, Holliday, and three additional attendees at the event:\nD’Angelo Jones, Magnolia Becerra, and Benjamin Wood.\nThe plaintiffs in the second lawsuit, which commenced in\nSeptember 2010, were Lopez and Jessica Rodriguez, an\nattendee.3 The complaint in each case stated three claims:\n(1) a § 1983 claim for violation of the plaintiffs’ First\nAmendment rights of free speech and association; (2) a\n§ 1983 claim for violation of the Fourth Amendment, based\non the officers’ warrantless entry into the warehouse, their\narrest of several of the plaintiffs, the pat-down searches of the\nplaintiffs, and the plaintiffs’ detention in the field show-up;\n\n\n 3\n   The plaintiffs sued as representatives of a class consisting of all of the\n100 attendees at the event, but the district court denied their motion for\nclass certification on the grounds that their class definition was inadequate\nand that the class members’ warrantless-entry claims presented\nindividualized questions of law not susceptible to a “blanket\ndetermination.” Plaintiffs have not appealed that decision.\n\f10               LYALL V.

The court determined that most of\nthe plaintiffs were simply attendees at an open, widely\npublicized event and that they had no “possessory interest, or\nany other connection to the warehouse that might reasonably\nconfer an expectation of privacy.” It then rejected Cortez’s\nargument that his status as an organizer of the event entitled\nhim to Fourth Amendment standing, explaining that “mere\n\n\n  4\n    The defendants also sought summary judgment on all claims against\nPolice Chief Bratton and two of the named officers, on the ground that\nthere was insufficient evidence for the plaintiffs to proceed against those\nthree defendants.

Joseph Holliday\n\n    Joseph Holliday’s claim to a protected Fourth\nAmendment interest in the warehouse is stronger than that of\na mere attendee at the November 16 event. Holliday was\nmaking regular payments to Haglund, the subtenant of the\nwarehouse, so Holliday could use the warehouse to construct\nfilm sets. Holliday argues that this arrangement made him a\n“co-tenant” of the warehouse with a reasonable expectation\nof privacy and a property interest therein.\n\n    We hold that Holliday had neither sufficient possessory\nrights, nor a reasonable expectation of privacy, in the\nwarehouse. First, Holliday has insufficient possessory rights\nto raise Fourth Amendment concerns. He was not in\npossession of the warehouse on the night of November 16; he\nhad moved his film sets out of the way to allow the space to\nbe used for the event, and he was there solely as an attendee.\nHaglund referred to Holliday as simply one of several\n“friends of mine who have helped pay the rent” and to whom\nhe had given keys. He told Holliday at the outset of their\nrelationship that others would be given access to the\nwarehouse and that Holliday would need to “make room” for\nthem as circumstances warranted. And most importantly,\nHolliday did not have the right to exclude others from any\nportion of the warehouse. Tellingly, Holliday stated in his\ndeposition that he did not feel that his permission was\nrequired before the November 16 event could be held.\nNothing about Holliday’s arrangement with Haglund\n“indicates joint control and supervision” of the warehouse.\n\f               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                      19\n\n    For the same reasons, we likewise hold that Holliday\ncannot prevail under a reasonable-expectation-of-privacy\ntheory. Any expectation of privacy Holliday had in the space\nwas inextricably tied to his ownership or possessory rights\nover the areas searched. See, e.g., United States v. Nohara,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629057\"><a href=\"/opinion/629057/united-states-v-alan-nohara/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1242 (9th Cir. 1993). And as explained above,\nhe did not possess such rights when the officers conducted\ntheir search.\n\nC. Event Organizers (Cortez and Lopez)\n\n    We part ways with the district court with respect to Cortez\nand Lopez—the two plaintiffs who were present at the\nNovember 16 event not as attendees but as organizers.\nCortez and Lopez have standing to challenge the officers’\nwarrantless entry under Jones, and the district court therefore\nerred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on\ntheir warrantless-entry claims.\n\n    Unlike the attendees at the event, Cortez, Lopez, and the\nother organizers of the event were not “mere visitors,” as the\ndefendants claim; they had received permission from\nHaglund to use the warehouse on November 16 and were in\ncharge of the property that night. The organizers had\npossession of the warehouse, the right to control it, and the\nright to bring an action in trespass against intruders.10 See\nSmith v. Cap Concrete Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2157954\"><a href=\"/opinion/2157954/smith-v-cap-concrete-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

After Cortez impeded Officers\nCho and Cervantes at the warehouse door and objected to\ntheir presence, the officers’ entry into the warehouse was\ntrespassory, thereby implicating Jones. See Thomas,\n447 F.3d at 1199 (holding that an unauthorized driver of a\nrental car may have standing to challenge a search of the\nvehicle if he has permission to use the car from the authorized\ndriver); see also Jones, 362 U.S. at 259, 265–67 (holding\nJones had standing to challenge a search of his friend’s\napartment when the friend gave him use of the apartment and\na key).\n\n    The defendants argue that, even if Cortez and Lopez (or\nany other plaintiff) can show that they had a protected Fourth\nAmendment interest in the warehouse, we can affirm the\ngrant of summary judgment on the ground that the entry was\njustified by exigent circumstances. We disagree. In a § 1983\ncase, the question whether exigent circumstances existed is\ngenerally one for the jury. See, e.g., Fisher v.

Similarly, a\njury could conclude that Cortez’s behavior toward the officers\ndid not justify entering the warehouse without a warrant to\napprehend him. Any crime Cortez had committed was minor,\nand there was little chance that he would flee or destroy\nevidence.\n\n    We therefore cannot hold as a matter of law that exigent\ncircumstances justified the officers’ warrantless entry. The\nquestion of exigent circumstances should be put to the trier of\nfact on remand.\n\n                           * * *\n\n    Because Cortez’s and Lopez’s possessory interest in the\nwarehouse on the night of November 16 gave them standing\nto challenge the warrantless entry under Jones, the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to the defendants on\nCortez’s and Lopez’s warrantless-entry claims was error,\nregardless whether they had a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy in the warehouse—a question we do not decide. See\nJardines, 133 S. Ct. at 1417 (“One virtue of the Fourth\nAmendment’s property-rights baseline is that it keeps easy\ncases easy. That the officers . . . physically intrud[ed] on [a\nperson’s] property to gather evidence is enough to establish\nthat a search occurred.”). We accordingly reverse the grant\nof summary judgment as to Cortez and Lopez and remand\ntheir warrantless-entry claims for further proceedings. We\n\f22              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\naffirm the grant of summary judgment as to the other\nplaintiffs’ warrantless-entry claims.\n\n                                  III\n\n    We next consider Cortez’s argument that the district court\nerred in concluding that Heck v. Humphrey bars him from\nchallenging his unreasonable seizure by the police under\n§ 1983. We agree with the district court that the Heck bar\napplies.\n\n    In Heck, the Supreme Court considered the question\nwhether a state prisoner could challenge his conviction by\nbringing a § 1983 suit based on allegedly unconstitutional\nacts committed by state actors during his arrest and\nprosecution. Heck, 512 U.S. at 478–79. The Court concluded\nthat such a claim was not cognizable under § 1983 because\ntort lawsuits generally “are not appropriate vehicles for\nchallenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments.”\nId. at 486. The Court therefore held that “in order to recover\ndamages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or\nimprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose\nunlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,\na § 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence\nhas been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive\norder, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make\nsuch determination, or called into question by a federal\ncourt’s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.” Id. at 486–87\n(footnote omitted).11\n\n\n\n  11\n    Whether the Heck bar applies may also turn on whether a plaintiff’s\n§ 1983 claim undermines the prior conviction in question. Because the\nparties have not argued this issue on appeal, we do not reach it.\n\f              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                    23\n\n    Four years later, in Spencer v. Kemna, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118176\"><a href=\"/opinion/118176/spencer-v-kemna/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998),\nfive Justices of the Court suggested that Heck’s scope might\nbe narrower than Heck itself indicated. In Spencer, an inmate\nwas released on parole but then had his parole revoked.\nWhen he returned to prison, the inmate first challenged the\nparole revocation in the state courts and then, when that\nchallenge was unsuccessful, filed a federal habeas petition.\nBefore the federal district court could rule on the petition, the\ninmate completed his term of imprisonment and was released\nagain. Id. at 5–6. The district court thus dismissed the\nhabeas petition as moot.\n\n    The Court held that the habeas petition was indeed moot\nand had to be dismissed. In his opinion for the majority,\nJustice Scalia rejected the inmate’s argument that his habeas\npetition should not be considered moot because he needed to\nobtain habeas relief as a prerequisite to pursuing a § 1983\naction. The majority described this as “a great non sequitur,\nunless one believes (as we do not) that a § 1983 action for\ndamages must always and everywhere be available.” Id. at\n17.\n\n     Justice Souter, however, wrote a concurrence joined by\nthree other Justices, in which he argued that the petitioner\nwas not, in fact, barred by Heck from suing about his parole\nrevocation under § 1983. He explained that Heck had not\nmade favorable termination of criminal proceedings “an\nelement of any § 1983 action alleging unconstitutional\nconviction”; rather, Heck’s rule applied only to prisoners “in\ncustody” to whom habeas was available, because the Court\nhad adopted the Heck rule in order to prevent a conflict\nbetween the habeas statute and § 1983. Id. at 19–20 (Souter,\nJ., concurring). Thus, Justice Souter concluded, “a former\nprisoner, no longer ‘in custody,’ may bring a § 1983 action\n\f24            LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nestablishing the unconstitutionality of a conviction or\nconfinement without being bound to satisfy a\nfavorable-termination requirement that it would be\nimpossible as a matter of law for him to satisfy,” because\nafter a prisoner is released, “the habeas statute and its\nexhaustion requirement have nothing to do with his right to\nany relief.” Id. at 21.\n\n    Justice Stevens dissented in Spencer, arguing that the\npetitioner’s habeas petition was not moot. In a footnote,\nhowever, he agreed with Justice Souter’s view of Heck,\nstating that “it is perfectly clear, as Justice Souter explains,\nthat [the petitioner] may bring an action under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983.” Id. at 25 n.8 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In total,\ntherefore, five Justices on the Spencer Court took the position\nthat the Heck bar does not necessarily apply to a person who\nis unable to challenge his conviction by way of federal\nhabeas.\n\n    We have looked to the separate Spencer opinions for\nguidance as to whether Heck’s favorable-termination\nrequirement applies in all § 1983 cases and have concluded\nthat, at least sometimes, it does not. Two cases, Nonnette v.\nSmall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780558\"><a href=\"/opinion/780558/narvis-g-nonnette-v-larry-small-r-schelke-e-castro-d-johnson-ma/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2002), and Guerrero v.

In\nNonnette, a state prisoner, after first exhausting his prison\nadministrative remedies, brought a § 1983 suit against prison\nofficials, alleging that they wrongly revoked some of his\ngood-time credits and placed him in administrative\nsegregation without giving him adequate process. The\ndistrict court held that his § 1983 action was barred by Heck.\nBy the time we heard his appeal, however, the inmate had\nbeen released. We held that because any habeas corpus\n\f              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                    25\n\npetition filed by the now-former inmate would be dismissed\nas moot, he was not barred by Heck from bringing a § 1983\nsuit. Nonnette, 316 F.3d at 877. We stated that this holding\n“affects only former prisoners challenging loss of good-time\ncredits, revocation of parole or similar matters; the status of\nprisoners challenging their underlying convictions or\nsentences does not change upon release, because they\ncontinue to be able to petition for a writ of habeas corpus.”\nId. at 878 n.7.\n\n    In Guerrero, decided four years later, we distinguished\nNonnette and concluded that an ex-inmate’s § 1983 suit was\nbarred by Heck. The plaintiff in Guerrero alleged that\nvarious LAPD officials had conspired to subject him to\nexcessive force, wrongful arrest, and malicious prosecution.\nGuerrero, 442 F.3d at 702. He did not file suit until\napproximately a year after his release from prison. Id.\nExamining our previous decisions, we determined that\n“timely pursuit of available habeas relief” is an important\nprerequisite for a § 1983 plaintiff seeking to escape the Heck\nbar. Id. at 705. Thus, we explained, the plaintiff in Nonnette\ndeserved relief from the Heck bar because he “immediately\npursued relief after the incident giving rise to [his] claims and\ncould not seek habeas relief only because of the shortness of\nhis prison sentence.” Id. Guerrero, by contrast, never\nchallenged his convictions prior to filing his § 1983 suit,\ndespite having years in custody in which to do so. We held\nthat this “self-imposed” failure to seek habeas relief was not\na ground for allowing Guerrero to escape the Heck bar.\n\f26               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n    Cortez’s case is more akin to Guerrero than to Nonnette.12\nCortez does not come within the narrow exception recognized\nin Spencer and Nonnette. Nonnette’s relief from Heck\n“‘affects only former prisoners challenging loss of good-time\ncredits, revocation of parole or similar matters,’ not\nchallenges to an underlying conviction.” Id. (quoting\nNonnette, 316 F.3d at 878 n.7). We are not an alternative\nforum for challenging his conviction. We therefore affirm\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\ndefendants with respect to Cortez’s unreasonable-seizure\nclaim.\n\n                                    IV\n\n    Finally, we turn to the plaintiffs’ four claims of error\nrelating to the jury instructions given at trial. None of these\nclaims has merit.\n\nA. Plaintiffs’ Requested Instructions on the Lawfulness of\n   their Search and Seizure and of the Officers’ Orders\n\n    After the close of the evidence, the plaintiffs requested\nthat the district court instruct the jury that the officers’ search\n\n\n 12\n     We acknowledge that Cortez’s inability to obtain federal habeas relief\nis no fault of his own: He was in custody for only two days after his arrest\nand was not sentenced to any prison time as a result of his infraction\nconviction. The brevity of Cortez’s time in custody made federal habeas\neffectively unavailable to him. But Cortez failed to exercise his right,\nunder California law, to a direct appeal from his conviction. See Cal.\nPenal Code § 1466(b)(1). Cortez’s success in his § 1983 suit would imply\nthat his conviction in California was wrongly obtained. Yet his conviction\nhas never been invalidated. Indeed, Cortez has never sought to invalidate\nit through direct appeal or post-conviction relief. He is thus barred by\nHeck.\n\f              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                  27\n\nof the plaintiffs for weapons and the plaintiffs’ detention\nduring the field show-up were unlawful. In pertinent part, the\nproposed instruction read:\n\n       I instruct you that each plaintiff was seized\n       and subjected to a search within the meaning\n       of the Fourth Amendment. I further instruct\n       you that the detention and search of each\n       plaintiff was in violation of the Fourth\n       Amendment.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ request for this instruction was the equivalent\nof a motion for judgment as a matter of law, given that the\ninstruction would have compelled the jury to decide for the\nplaintiffs on the ultimate issue in the case (i.e., whether the\nofficers’ conduct was reasonable).

The theft suspects’ car had been seen in close proximity\nto the warehouse, suggesting that the suspects might have\ntaken refuge inside.

The officers testified that the\ncrowd reacted angrily when they attempted to subdue Cortez\nand that they believed they were in danger—a belief that was\nexacerbated when the wooden partition, which they thought\nsomeone had pushed, fell on top of them. It was reasonable\nfor the jury to conclude, in light of this testimony, that the\nofficers had sufficient fear for their own safety to justify\nsearching the plaintiffs for weapons, see Terry v.

We disagree.\nThere is “no bright line rule for determining when an investigatory [Terry]\nstop crosses the line and becomes an arrest”; rather, “whether an arrest has\noccurred depends on all the surrounding circumstances, and each case\nmust be decided on its own facts.” Allen v.

The Supreme Court\nhas indicated, moreover, that “[i]f the purpose underlying a Terry\nstop—investigating possible criminal activity—is to be served, the police\nmust under certain circumstances be able to detain the individual for\nlonger than the brief time period involved in Terry,” and that one such\ncircumstance is that “‘[i]f it is known that an offense has occurred in the\n\f                 LYALL V.

The district court did not err by refusing to\ngive this instruction.\n\nB. Plaintiffs’ Requested Instruction on “Individualized\n   Suspicion”\n\n    At trial, the plaintiffs contended that the searches and\nseizures that occurred after they were ordered out of the\nwarehouse were unlawful because the police did not have\nreasonable suspicion that any particular member of the crowd\nwas armed or was a suspect in the crime. The plaintiffs\nrequested that the district court instruct the jury that:\n\n         Defendants were obligated to have\n         individualized suspicion as to each plaintiff\n         whom you find was detained or searched or\n         arrested.

Thus, the fact that the officers’\nreasonable suspicion of wrongdoing is not particularized to\neach member of a group of individuals present at the same\nlocation does not automatically mean that a search of the\npeople in the group is unlawful. Rather, the trier of fact must\ndecide whether the search was reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances.\n\n    Other courts have acknowledged that police officers can\nhave reasonable suspicion to search, or even probable cause\nto arrest, a group or crowd of people without individualized\nsuspicion as to each person in the group. For example, in\nCarr v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187471\"><a href=\"/opinion/187471/carr-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2009),\na group of persons arrested in a protest march sued under\n§ 1983, alleging that they were arrested without probable\ncause. They argued that the government was required to\nprove that the police possessed probable cause to believe that\neach individual person arrested was engaged in the crime of\nrioting. Id. at 406. But the D.C. Circuit rejected that\nargument, stating that it would impose “an impossible\nburden” on police and holding that “[p]olice witnesses must\nonly be able to form a reasonable belief that the entire crowd\nis acting as a unit and therefore all members of the crowd\nviolated the law.” Id. at 408.\n\n    We therefore agree with the district court that the\ndefendants in this case were not required to have\nindividualized suspicion with respect to each plaintiff in order\nto have reasonable suspicion to search and detain them. To\nbe sure, the fact that the officers did not see specific plaintiffs\nwith weapons or engaging in violent behavior, and that many\n\f32            LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nof the plaintiffs did not match the police call’s description of\nthe suspects as “male Hispanic juveniles,” bore on the\nquestion whether the searches and seizures were reasonable.\nStanding alone, however, the officers’ lack of individualized\nsuspicion did not make the searches and seizures unlawful.\n\n    Ybarra v. Illinois, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), is not to the\ncontrary. In Ybarra, the police received a tip from an\ninformant that “Greg,” a bartender at a certain tavern,\npossessed heroin and would have some for sale at the tavern\non a particular date. On the basis of the tip, the police\nobtained a warrant to search the tavern and Greg’s person for\nheroin and other contraband. Id. at 87–88. When the police\narrived at the tavern to execute the warrant, they announced\nupon entering that they would be conducting a “cursory\nsearch for weapons” of each of the nine to thirteen customers\nin the tavern. One of the officers frisked Ybarra, a patron in\nthe tavern, and felt a cigarette pack in Ybarra’s pocket during\nthe frisk; a few minutes later, he frisked Ybarra again, took\nthe pack out of his pocket, and found six packets of heroin\ninside. Ybarra was subsequently indicted for, and convicted\nof, possession of heroin. Id. at 88–89.\n\n    The Supreme Court held that the search violated Ybarra’s\nFourth Amendment rights. The Court explained the police\nlacked probable cause to believe that Ybarra was committing\nany crime: “Ybarra made no gestures indicative of criminal\nconduct, made no movements that might suggest an attempt\nto conceal contraband, and said nothing of a suspicious nature\nto the police officers.” Id. at 91. Indeed, the only thing the\npolice officers knew about Ybarra was that he was “present,\nalong with several other customers, in a public tavern at a\ntime when the police had reason to believe that the bartender\nwould have heroin for sale.” Id. The Court deemed this fact\n\f               LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                    33\n\ninsufficient to give the police probable cause to believe that\nYbarra was committing a crime. The Court went on to hold\nthat the initial search could not be upheld as a reasonable\nTerry frisk, because Ybarra had done nothing to indicate to\nthe police that he was armed and dangerous. Id. at 93–94.\n\n    Ybarra stands for the proposition that, if a person is\nsimply present in the vicinity of potential criminal activity,\nwithout doing anything else to indicate that he is engaging in\ncriminal activity or that he is armed and dangerous, the police\ndo not have probable cause to search him or reasonable\nsuspicion sufficient to detain him and frisk him for weapons.\nYbarra does not, however, imply that the police can never\npossess reasonable suspicion or probable cause unless it is\nindividualized. If a group or crowd of people is behaving as\na unit and it is not possible (as it was in Ybarra) for the police\nto tell who is armed and dangerous or engaging in criminal\nacts and who is not, the police can have reasonable suspicion\nas to the members of the group. Thus, the district court’s\ninstruction did not conflict with Ybarra.\n\nC. The Court’s Instruction on the Elements of the Bane Act\n\n    Finally, the plaintiffs contend that the district court’s\ninstruction on the elements of their claim under the Bane Act\nmisstated California law in several respects. Specifically, the\nplaintiffs argue that the district court’s Bane Act instruction\nerroneously required them to prove (1) that the defendants\ninterfered with their rights “by threatening or committing\nviolent acts,” (2) that the plaintiffs believed that if they\nexercised their right to be free from unreasonable detention\nand search, “then defendants would commit violence against”\nthem; and (3) that “the [police] threats, intimidation, or\ncoercion were independent from the acts inherent in the\n\f34                LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\ndetention and search.” The plaintiffs claim that the Bane Act\ndoes not, in fact, require proof of any of these things.\n\n    We can easily dispose of the plaintiffs’ arguments about\nthe first two aspects of the district court’s Bane Act\ninstruction. The language concerning “violent acts” and the\nplaintiffs’ fear of violence closely tracks that of California’s\nmodel Bane Act instruction, CACI Instruction No. 3066,14\nwhich at least one California appellate court has approved as\na correct statement of law. See Austin B. v. Escondido Union\nSch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2276163\"><a href=\"/opinion/2276163/austin-b-v-escondido-union-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 471 (Ct. App. 2007) (quoting\nan earlier version of the same instruction). The district court\ndid not err by including these elements in its instruction.\n\n    The plaintiffs’ third objection to the district court’s Bane\nAct instruction—i.e., that it wrongly required them to show\nthreats, intimidation, or coercion independent from the acts\ninherent in their detention and search—likewise lacks merit.\nNumerous California decisions make clear that a plaintiff in\na search-and-seizure case must allege threats or coercion\nbeyond the coercion inherent in a detention or search in order\nto recover under the Bane Act. See, e.g., Allen v. City of\nSacramento, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678 (Ct.

Rptr. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 491 (Ct. App. 2014) (“The\ncoercion inherent in detention is insufficient to show a Bane\nAct violation.”); Shoyoye v.

Rptr. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">839</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 849 (Ct. App. 2012) (“The [Bane Act] requires a\nshowing of coercion independent from the coercion inherent\nin the wrongful detention itself.”).\n\n\n 14\n      See Judicial Council of Cal., 2 Civil Jury Instructions 240 (2011).\n\f              LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                  35\n\n    The plaintiffs cite two search-and-seizure cases in which,\nthey argue, California courts held that a plaintiff can state a\nBane Act claim without a showing of independent threats,\ncoercion, or intimidation, but neither citation supports their\nposition. In Venegas v. County of Los Angeles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2583901\"><a href=\"/opinion/2583901/venegas-v-county-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n13–14 (Cal. 2004), the California Supreme Court decided\nonly that a plaintiff need not allege that a defendant acted\nwith “discriminatory animus” in order to state a Bane Act\nclaim; the court did not otherwise address what elements the\nBane Act requires a plaintiff to prove. See Allen, 183 Cal.\nRptr. 3d at 676 (“[T]he only issue the Supreme Court\nconsidered [in Venegas] was whether [the Bane Act] required\na showing that the defendants acted with discriminatory\nanimus.”). And in Bender v. County of Los Angeles, 159 Cal.\nRptr. 3d 204 (Ct. App. 2013), an unlawful-arrest and\nexcessive-force case, the Court of Appeal expressly declined\nto rule on whether the Bane Act required coercion beyond the\ncoercion inherent in any arrest; it held only that “[w]here, as\nhere, an arrest is unlawful and excessive force is applied in\nmaking the arrest, there has been coercion ‘independent from\nthe coercion inherent in the wrongful detention itself’—a\nviolation of the Bane Act.” Id. at 213 (quoting Shoyoye,\n137 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 839). In short, Venegas and Bender do\nnot speak to the issue the plaintiffs raise, and they cast no\ndoubt on the correctness of the district court’s instruction.\n\n                              V\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment with respect to Javier Cortez’s\nand Elizabeth Lopez’s warrantless-entry claims, and we\n\f36          LYALL V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nremand those claims for trial. We otherwise affirm. The\nparties shall bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n  AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND\nREMANDED.\n\f</pre>",
