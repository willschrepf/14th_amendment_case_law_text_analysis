Because of their release and because defendants\n\"had substantially complied with the ADA\" as to on-site facilities and \"were continuing\nto correct deficiencies[,]\" the court refused to grant injunctive relief.3 However, the court\ngranted plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief, finding that certain of WMCC's facilities\nand programs violated the ADA.\n\n\n      On appeal, the State argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\nto issue declaratory relief because plaintiffs' claims were moot at the time of the court's\ndecision. We agree. \"Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and can only hear\nactual 'cases or controversies' as defined under Article III of the Constitution.\"\nNeighborhood Transp. Network, Inc. v. Pena, 42 F.3d 1169, 1172 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\"When a case . . . no longer presents an actual, ongoing case or controversy, the case is\nmoot and the federal court no longer has jurisdiction to hear it.\"\n\n\n\n      1\n       Before trial, plaintiffs dismissed Correctional Medical Services as a defendant.\nAlso, before trial, the district court granted the individual defendants' motion for\nsummary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity. Plaintiffs have not appealed\nthat decision.\n      2\n       At trial, the court granted Barber's motion to withdraw from the case.\n      3\n       Plaintiffs have not cross-appealed the district court's denial of injunctive relief\nor any other aspect of the court's judgment.\n                                           -3-\n\fId. This requirement applies to all stages of the litigation, id., and \"applies with equal\nforce to actions for declaratory judgment as it does to actions seeking traditional coercive\nrelief.\" Marine Equip. Management Co. v. United States, 4 F.3d 643, 646 (8th Cir.\n1993).\n\n\n         Because plaintiffs have been released on parole and are no longer confined at\nWMCC, their claims are moot. See Martin v. Sargent, 780 F.2d 1334, 1337 (8th Cir.\n1985) (ordinarily claim \"to improve prison conditions is moot if [plaintiff] is no longer\nsubject to those conditions\"). Contrary to plaintiffs' argument, their claims do not fall\nwithin the \"capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review\" exception to the mootness doctrine.\nThis exception \"applies only in exceptional situations, where the following two\ncircumstances [are] simultaneously present: (1) the challenged action [is] in its duration\ntoo short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a\nreasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subject to the same\naction again[.]\" Spencer v. Kemna, 118 S. Ct. 978, 988 (1998) (internal quotations and\ncitations omitted).\n\n\n         As to the \"evading-review\" prong, \"the focus of our analysis . . . is not on the\nlength of time over which the particular action challenged occurred.\" Clark v. Brewer,\n776 F.2d 226, 229 (8th Cir. 1985). \"Rather, the proper inquiry is whether the\n[challenged] activity is by its very nature short in duration, so that it could not, or\nprobably would not, be able to be adjudicated while fully alive.\" Id. (emphasis in original;\ninternal quotation omitted). For example, in Clark, this court held that a challenge to a\nprison's close management segregation policy satisfied the first prong because the\n\"segregation w[ould] normally terminate and the inmate w[ould] be returned to the\ngeneral penitentiary population long before a challenge to his\n\n                                          -4-\n\fsegregation. . . c[ould] be litigated fully.\" Id.; see also Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 125\n(1973) (\"human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before\nthe usual appellate process is complete\"); Van Bergen v. Minnesota, 59 F.3d 1541, 1547\n(8th Cir. 1995) (election issues \"are almost invariably of too short a duration in which to\ncomplete litigation\").\n\n\n       In this case, plaintiffs have not shown that the duration of the alleged illegal\nconditions is \"always so short as to evade review.\" Spencer, 118 S. Ct. at 988. Thus,\n\"[p]utting aside whether this is a case that is 'capable of repetition,' it has not been shown\nto be of the type that necessarily 'evades review' . . ..\" Neighborhood Transp. Network,\nInc., 42 F.3d at 1172-73 (footnote omitted). In other words, although plaintiffs' claims\nare moot, \"[i]t does not follow . . . that similar future cases will evade review.\" Id. at\n1173. As the district court stated in denying injunctive relief, if plaintiffs violate their\nparole and return to WMCC, and the alleged illegal conditions \"persist or are repeated,\"\nthe court can \"deal with the situation at that time.\"4\n\n\n       We also do not believe that plaintiffs meet the \"capable-of-repetition\" prong.\nRelying on Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305 (1988), plaintiffs argue that given their history,\nthere is \"a reasonable expectation\" that at least one of them will violate parole and return\nto WMCC. Their reliance on Honig is misplaced. In Honig, the Supreme Court\nemphasized that \"for purposes of assessing the likelihood that state authorities will\nreinflict a given injury, [courts] generally have been unwilling to assume that the party\nseeking relief will repeat the type of misconduct that would once again place him or her\n\n\n       4\n        The Seventh Circuit has indicated that the capable-of-repetition doctrine applies\n\"without discriminating between claims for declaratory relief and claims for injunctive\nrelief.\" Higgason v. Farley, 83 F.3d 807, 811 (7th Cir. 1996).\n                                           -5-\n\fat risk of that injury.\" Id. at 320. However, \"[g]iven the unique circumstances and\ncontext of th[e] case,\" the Court was willing to assume that a plaintiff whose \"very\ninability to conform his conduct to socially acceptable norms that render[ed] him\n‘handicapped’\" would \"again engage in the type of misconduct that precipitated th[e]\nsuit.\" Id. at 320-21. In contrast, here, plaintiffs are \"in control of the type of conduct that\nwill put [them] in jail again and subject [them] to the same deprivations alleged in [their]\ncomplaint.\" Reimers v. Oregon, 863 F.2d 630, 632 n.4 (9th Cir. 1988). Indeed, they are\n\" 'required by law--to prevent such a possibility from occurring.' \" Spencer v. Kemna, 91\nF.3d 1114, 1118 (8th Cir. 1996) (quoting Lane v. Williams, 455 U.S. 624, 632-33 n.13\n(1982)), aff'd, 118 S. Ct. 978 (1998).5\n\n\n       Nor, contrary to plaintiffs' argument, does the voluntary-cessation doctrine save\ntheir claims from being moot. It is true that \"[g]enerally, the 'voluntary cessation of\nallegedly illegal conduct . . . does not make the case moot.' \" United States v. Mercy\nHealth Serv., 107 F.3d 632, 636 (8th Cir. 1997) (quoting United States v. W.T. Grant\nCo., 345 U.S. 629, 632 (1953)). However, defendants' compliance with the ADA,\nincluding structural changes such as installation of ramps, pull and grab bars, and chair\nlifts, is far \"more than a mere voluntary cessation of alleged illegal conduct, where we\nwould leave [t]he defendant[s] . . . free to return to [their] old ways.\" Preiser v.\nNewkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 402 (1975) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n\n       5\n        Plaintiffs' reliance on Clark v. Brewer, 776 F.2d at 226, is also misplaced. In\nthat case, we held that an inmate's challenge to close management segregation was not\nmoot even though after filing a complaint he had been released from segregation. We\nfound that the case was capable of repetition because it was a \"virtual certainty\" he\nwould once again be in close management segregation given that at the time of this\ncourt's decision he was in punitive detention and, pursuant to a prison regulation, at the\ncompletion of the detention, he would be \"automatically\" returned to close management\nsegregation. Id. at 229.\n                                            -6-\n\fMoreover, the doctrine is inapplicable because \"resumption of the challenged conduct\ndoes not depend solely on the defendants' capricious actions.\" Allen v. Likins, 517 F.2d\n532, 535 (8th Cir. 1975) (internal quotation omitted). \"The defendants cannot resume\ntheir allegedly illegal conduct [as to plaintiffs] until [they] voluntarily commit[] an act\njustifying [their] parole revocation.\" Id.\n\n\n       Finally, plaintiffs suggest that there is a general public-interest exception to\nmootness. In support, they note that this court has not yet decided whether the ADA\napplies to prisons and assert that it was in the public interest for the district court to do\nso. However, there is no such exception in federal courts. \"[A]lthough state law may\nsave [a] case from mootness based on public interest, federal courts require litigants'\nrights be affected.\" Spencer, 91 F.3d at 1118. We note that on April 28, 1998, the\nSupreme Court in Yeskey v. Pennsylvania Dep't of Corrections, 118 F.3d 168 (3rd Cir.\n1997), cert. granted, 118 S. Ct. 876 (1998), heard argument on whether the ADA applies\nto prisons. We thus decline to address that question at this time.\n\n\n       Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with\ndirections to dismiss the complaint as moot.6\n\n\n       6\n         We note that the district court stayed plaintiffs' motion for attorney's fees\npending resolution of this appeal. Although in some circumstances an award of fees\nmay save a case from being moot, see Community Publishers, Inc. v. DR Partners, No.\n95-2976, 1998 WL 131260, at *4 n.3 (8th Cir. Mar. 25, 1998), as a general rule, and\nin this case, \"a claim for attorneys’ fees is . . . not sufficient to save a case from being\nmoot.\" Neighborhood Transp. Network, Inc., 42 F.3d at 1172 n.2. In fact, even if a\ncase is moot, \"[t]his court has recognized the 'catalyst' theory of prevailing parties,\"\nwhich provides that a plaintiff can be a prevailing party for purposes of attorney’s fees\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1988 if \" 'his suit is a catalyst for the defendant's voluntary\ncompliance and the defendant's compliance was not gratuitous.' \" St. Louis Fire\nFighters Ass'n v. City of St. Louis, 96 F.3d 323, 330-31 (8th Cir. 1996) (quoting Little\n                                             -7-\n\f      A true copy.\n\n\n            Attest:\n\n\n                CLERK, U.

At this\ntime, we leave to the district court’s discretion whether to award attorney fees and, if\nso, in what amount.\n                                         -8-\n\f",

Because of their release and because defendants\n\"had substantially complied with the ADA\" as to on-site facilities and \"were continuing\nto correct deficiencies[,]\" the court refused to grant injunctive relief.3 However, the court\ngranted plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief, finding that certain of WMCC's facilities\nand programs violated the ADA.\n\n\n      On appeal, the State argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\nto issue declaratory relief because plaintiffs' claims were moot at the time of the court's\ndecision.
