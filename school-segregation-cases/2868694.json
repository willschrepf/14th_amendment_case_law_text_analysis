Connor, 515 U.S. 472 (1995). The appeal\nrequires us to consider the effect of the Sandin decision on\nAllah's access-to-courts claims, including his claim that he\nwas kept in administrative segregation in retaliation for\nfiling civil rights lawsuits.\n\nI.\n\nAllah, who was granted leave to proceed in forma\npauperis, filed his pro se complaint on September 19, 1997\nalleging that he was being kept in administrative\nsegregation at S.C.I. Greene in retaliation forfiling civil\n\n                                  2\n\frights lawsuits against prison officials at S.C.I. Frackville\nand S.C.I. Graterford, two prisons where he had earlier\nbeen housed, and that while he was kept in administrative\nsegregation he was denied meaningful access to the courts.\n\nAccording to his complaint, Allah was transferred from\nS.C.I. Frackville to S.C.I. Greene on July 9, 1997 and was\nplaced in administrative segregation. He was told by the\nofficer in charge that the officer \"had not had a chance to\nreview [his] records\" but that Allah would be brought before\nthe Program Review Committee (\"PRC\") the next day, July\n10. App. at 10. Allah was brought before the PRC on July\n15 and was told that the PRC still did not have his records\nbut that he would be seen every 30 days. Allah alleges the\nPRC did have his records but kept him in administrative\nsegregation in retaliation for filing lawsuits when he was\nhoused at other prisons. He was again brought before the\nPRC on August 12, 1998 and denied release to the general\npopulation, with \"[n]o valid reason given.\" App. at 11. On\nSeptember 9, 1997, he was again brought before the PRC\nand denied release to the general population.\n\nAllah alleges in his complaint that he is \"unable to file\nand product [sic] briefs\" in his criminal case and unable to\nconduct discovery in his civil rights cases while in\nadministrative segregation at S.C.I. Greene. App. at 10. His\ncomplaint seeks relief in the form of compensation damages\nand punitive damages. In his briefs he asserts that he also\nseeks injunctive and declaratory relief.\n\nOn September 29, 1997, before service of the complaint,\nthe Magistrate Judge recommended that the complaint be\ndismissed for failure to state a claim, stating:\n\n       In Sandin v. Connor, 115 S. Ct. 2293 (1995), the Court\n       held that housing an inmate in disciplinary custody did\n       not impose such atypical and significant hardships on\n       the inmate so as to invoke Constitutional protection.\n       Thus, the plaintiff 's complaint here is without merit\n       . . .\n\nReport and Recommendation, Doc. # 6 (Sept. 29, 1997) at\n2. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's Report\nand Recommendation as the opinion of the court and\nordered the complaint dismissed. Allah timely appealed.\n\n                               3\n\fThis court appointed counsel to represent Allah on appeal.1\nWe also requested that the Commonwealth submit a brief\nand argue as amicus curiae.2 The appeal was consolidated\nwith another brought by Allah in a separate case captioned\nAllah v. Al-Hafeez, No. 98-1385. The two consolidated\nappeals present distinct legal issues, and we address the\nissues in separate opinions.\n\nOur review of the District Court's sua sponte dismissal\nfor failure to state a claim, which was authorized by 28\nU.S.C. S 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(c)(2), like\nthat for dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), is plenary.\nSee Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). \"[W]e must accept as true the factual allegations in\nthe complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be\ndrawn therefrom.\" Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.2d 63, 65 (3d Cir.\n1996).\n\nII.\n\nAllah alleges two claims in his complaint: that he was\ndenied meaningful access to the courts while he was kept\nin administrative segregation and that he was kept in\nadministrative segregation in retaliation for filing civil rights\nclaims against prison officials at S.C.I. Frackville and S.C.I.\nGraterford. The District Court interpreted Sandin to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. We expressed our appreciation to this firm and others in note 4 of the\ncompanion opinion in Allah v. Al-Hafeez, No. 98-1385.\n\n2. A motions panel of this court requested that the parties address\nseveral additional issues in their briefs, including, inter alia, whether\nany\nor all of Allah's claims are moot, whether Allah has exhausted available\nadministrative remedies in accordance with 42 U.S.C.S 1997e(a),\nwhether Allah's claims seeking monetary damages are barred by 42\nU.S.C. S 1997e(e), and what standard should be applied to a claim\nalleging retaliation for exercising the right to petition the courts. For\nthe\nmost part, those issues are not directly presented by this appeal, and we\naccordingly do not decide them here. As for mootness, a jurisdictional\nissue, it is clear, and the parties do not dispute, that at least Allah's\nclaims for damages survive his release from administrative segregation.\nSee Weaver v. Wilcox, 650 F.2d 22, 27 n.13 (3d Cir. 1981) (stating that\nprisoner's transfer from the prison moots claim for injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief with respect to prison conditions but not claim for\ndamages).\n\n                               4\n\fpreclude both of these claims, apparently in the belief that\nSandin stands for the principle that no claim arising out of\nadministrative segregation can form the basis for a\nconstitutional violation. We cannot agree with that\ninterpretation of Sandin.\n\nSandin involved a S 1983 suit brought by a state prisoner\nagainst several prison officials alleging that they had\nviolated his constitutional right to procedural due process\nby sentencing him to disciplinary segregation without\npermitting him to call certain witnesses. See 515 U.S. at\n476. The Supreme Court noted in Sandin that under the\nprocedure previously followed, if the Due Process Clause\nitself did not confer a liberty interest in a particular prison\nsituation,3 the federal courts would proceed to \"examin[e]\n. . . the possibility that the State had created a liberty\ninterest by virtue of its prison regulations. . . .\" Id. at 480\n(explaining the approach taken by the Court in Hewitt v.\nHelms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983)). The Supreme Court\nsubstantially modified that analysis in Sandin , holding that\nan examination of a state statute or regulation should not\nbe conducted unless the challenged restraint on freedom\n\"imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Id. at 484.\nAs the Court explained:\n\n       States may under certain circumstances create liberty\n       interests which are protected by the Due Process\n       Clause. But these interests will be generally limited to\n       freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding the\n       sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise\n       to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own\n       force, nonetheless imposes atypical and significant\n       hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\n       incidents of prison life.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The Court has held that the Due Process Clause confers a liberty\ninterest in certain situations. See, e.g., Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S.\n210 (1990) (holding that an inmate has a liberty interest in being\nprotected from the involuntary administration of psychotropic drugs);\nVitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480 (1980) (holding that an inmate has a liberty\ninterest in being free from involuntary transfer to mental hospital for\ntreatment).\n\n                               5\n\fId. at 483-84 (citations omitted). Applying this approach to\nthe facts of the case before it, the Court held that\"[the\nprisoner's] discipline in segregated confinement did not\npresent the type of atypical, significant deprivation in which\na State might conceivably create a liberty interest,\"\ninasmuch as \"[t]he regime to which [the prisoner] was\nsubjected . . . was within the range of confinement to be\nnormally expected for one serving an indeterminate term of\n30 years to life.\" Id. at 486-87.\n\nThe Court's opinion makes clear that the decision does\nnot foreclose other claims challenging the constitutionality\nof official actions. Specifically, it states:\n\n       Prisoners . . . , of course, retain other protection from\n       arbitrary state action even within the expected\n       conditions of confinement. They may invoke the First\n       and Eighth Amendments and the Equal Protection\n       Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment where\n       appropriate, and may draw upon internal prison\n       grievance procedures and state judicial review where\n       available.\n\nId. at 487 n.11.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that Allah's claim alleging\ndenial of his constitutional right to meaningful access to\nthe courts is not foreclosed by Sandin. In fact, the\nCommonwealth concedes as much in its brief, stating that\nthe District Court \"should have\" considered that claim. See\nAmicus Br. at 27. It is well settled that prisoners have a\nconstitutional right to access to the courts, which requires\naccess to \"adequate law libraries or adequate assistance\nfrom persons trained in the law\" for filing challenges to\ncriminal sentences, both direct and collateral, and civil\nrights actions. Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 828 (1977);\nsee also Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 355 (1996)\n(recognizing that the Constitution requires that prisoners\nbe provided the tools \"that the inmates need in order to\nattack their sentences, directly or collaterally, and in order\nto challenge the conditions of their confinement\"); Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 579 (1974) (extending right of\naccess to the courts, founded on the Due Process Clause,\nto prisoners filing actions under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 to\n\n                               6\n\fvindicate \"basic constitutional rights\"). 4 This right to access\nto the courts is distinct from any liberty interest in\nremaining free from administrative or disciplinary\nsegregation. A claim founded on the right of access remains\nviable after Sandin.5\n\nNor does Sandin preclude Allah's claim alleging that he\nwas kept in administrative segregation in retaliation for\nfiling civil rights suits against prison officials. We have\nrecognized that \"[t]he right of access to the courts . . . must\nbe freely exercisable without hindrance or fear of\nretaliation.\" Milhouse v. Carlson, 652 F.2d 371, 374 (3d Cir.\n1981) (locating right to access the courts in a retaliation\ncase in the First Amendment right to petition for redress of\ngrievances); see also Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574,\n588 n.10 (1998) (stating that \"[t]he reason why . . .\nretaliation offends the Constitution is that it threatens to\ninhibit exercise of the protected right\").\n\nSandin instructs that placement in administrative\nconfinement will generally not create a liberty interest. See\nGriffin v. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706 (3d Cir. 1997)\n(applying Sandin and holding that conditions experienced\nby prisoner in administrative custody did not implicate\nliberty interest). Retaliation may be actionable, however,\neven when the retaliatory action does not involve a liberty\ninterest. See, e.g., Stanley v. Litscher , 213 F.3d 340, 343\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The right to access to the courts has a number of constitutional roots,\nincluding the Due Process Clause and the First Amendment. See\ngenerally Peterkin v. Jeffes, 855 F.2d 1021, 1036 n.18 (3d Cir. 1988)\n(chronicling sources of the right).\n\n5. At argument, the Commonwealth suggested that Allah's access to\ncourts claim should be dismissed for failure to allege actual injury, as\nrequired by Casey. Under Casey, in order to have standing to challenge\nprison conditions as denying meaningful access to the courts, a prisoner\nmust plead facts to \"demonstrate that the alleged shortcomings . . .\nhindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.\" 518 U.S. at 351. Allah\nalleges, inter alia, that while he was in administrative segregation he\ndid\nnot have access to trained legal aids and as a result was unable to file\na brief in his post-conviction appeal, which he alleges was due on\nSeptember 10, 1997, the day after the date of his complaint. Construing\nAllah's complaint liberally, that allegation is sufficient to state a\nclaim\nunder Casey.\n\n                               7\n\f(7th Cir. 2000) (holding that plaintiff stated claim for\nretaliatory transfer even though no liberty interest involved\nin transfer); Rouse v. Benson, 193 F.3d 936, 939 (8th Cir.\n1999) (same). \"[G]overnment actions, which standing alone\ndo not violate the Constitution, may nonetheless be\nconstitutional torts if motivated in substantial part by a\ndesire to punish an individual for exercise of a\nconstitutional right.\" Thaddeus-X v. Blatter , 175 F.3d 378,\n386 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc).\n\nOur holding that claims alleging retaliation for the\nexercise of First Amendment rights survive Sandin is\nconsistent with those circuits that have considered the\nissue. In Pratt v. Rowland, 65 F.3d 802, 806-07 (9th Cir.\n1995), the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that\nSandin did not bar a claim alleging that a prisoner-plaintiff\nhad been transferred and placed in a double cell in\nretaliation for a television interview that he had given. The\ncourt stated:\n\n       To succeed on his retaliation claim, [the plaintiff] need\n       not establish an independent constitutional interest in\n       either assignment to a given prison or placement in a\n       single cell, because the crux of his claim is that state\n       officials violated his First Amendment rights by\n       retaliating against him for his protected speech\n       activities.\n\nId. at 806. In Babcock v. White, 102 F.3d 267, 274-75 (7th\nCir. 1996), the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\nagreed, holding that a prisoner-plaintiff 's claim that a\nprison official had prevented an expeditious transfer in\nretaliation for his filing lawsuits against prison officials was\nactionable \"even if [the prison official's] actions did not\nindependently violate the Constitution\" and thus was not\nbarred by Sandin.\n\nThe Commonwealth argues that \"the sense of the Sandin\nopinion\" counsels us to hold that continued placement in\nadministrative confinement can never amount to adverse\naction sufficient to support a retaliation claim. Amicus Br.\nat 18. As the Supreme Court recognized in its footnote in\nSandin, however, \"[p]risoners . . . retain other protection\nfrom arbitrary state action even within the expected\n\n                               8\n\fconditions of confinement.\" 515 U.S. 487 n.11 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nWe recently explained this court's position on the adverse\naction prong of a retaliation claim in Suppan v. Dadonna,\n203 F.3d 228 (3d Cir. 2000). There, we considered whether\nthe defendants' action of placing plaintiffs lower on\npromotion ranking lists in retaliation for the exercise of\ntheir First Amendment free speech rights was sufficiently\nadverse to state a claim for retaliation. We held that it was,\nstating that a fact finder could conclude that\"the alleged\nretaliatory conduct was sufficient `to deter a person of\nordinary firmness' from exercising his First Amendment\nrights.\" Id. at 235 (quoting Bart v. Telford, 677 F.2d 622,\n625 (7th Cir. 1982)). This same test has been applied in the\nprison context. See Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 396-99;\nCrawford-El v. Britton, 93 F.3d 813, 826 (D.C. Cir. 1996)\n(en banc) (approving the Bart standard in the prison\ncontext), reversed on other grounds, 523 U.S. 574 (1998).\n\nAlthough it is possible that in some cases placement in\nadministrative segregation would not deter a prisoner of\nordinary firmness from exercising his or her First\nAmendment rights, we cannot say that such action can\nnever amount to adverse action. On the contrary, whether\na prisoner-plaintiff has met that prong of his or her\nretaliation claim will depend on the facts of the particular\ncase.\n\nHere, Allah alleges that his confinement in administrative\nsegregation resulted, inter alia, in reduced access to phone\ncalls, reduced access to the commissary, reduced access to\nrecreation, confinement in his cell for all butfive hours per\nweek, denial of access to rehabilitative programs and,\nsignificantly, inadequate access to legal research materials\nand assistance. A fact finder could conclude from those\nfacts that retaliatory continued placement in administrative\nconfinement would \"deter a person of ordinaryfirmness\nfrom exercising his First Amendment rights.\" Suppan, 203\nF.3d at 235 (internal quotations omitted); see Thaddeus-X,\n175 F.3d at 396 (\"[A]n action comparable to transfer to\nadministrative segregation would certainly be adverse.\").\n\n                               9\n\fIII.\n\nFor the reasons stated, we will vacate the order of the\nDistrict Court sua sponte dismissing Allah's complaint as\nbarred by Sandin and will remand for further proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               10\n\f",

Connor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). The appeal\nrequires us to consider the effect of the Sandin decision on\nAllah's access-to-courts claims, including his claim that he\nwas kept in administrative segregation in retaliation for\nfiling civil rights lawsuits.\n\nI.\n\nAllah, who was granted leave to proceed in forma\npauperis, filed his pro se complaint on September 19, 1997\nalleging that he was being kept in administrative\nsegregation at S.C.I. Greene in retaliation forfiling civil\n\n                                  2\n\frights lawsuits against prison officials at S.C.I. Frackville\nand S.C.I. Graterford, two prisons where he had earlier\nbeen housed, and that while he was kept in administrative\nsegregation he was denied meaningful access to the courts.\n\nAccording to his complaint, Allah was transferred from\nS.C.I. Frackville to S.C.I. Greene on July 9, 1997 and was\nplaced in administrative segregation. He was told by the\nofficer in charge that the officer \"had not had a chance to\nreview [his] records\" but that Allah would be brought before\nthe Program Review Committee (\"PRC\") the next day, July\n10. App. at 10. Allah was brought before the PRC on July\n15 and was told that the PRC still did not have his records\nbut that he would be seen every 30 days. Allah alleges the\nPRC did have his records but kept him in administrative\nsegregation in retaliation for filing lawsuits when he was\nhoused at other prisons. He was again brought before the\nPRC on August 12, 1998 and denied release to the general\npopulation, with \"[n]o valid reason given.\" App. at 11. On\nSeptember 9, 1997, he was again brought before the PRC\nand denied release to the general population.\n\nAllah alleges in his complaint that he is \"unable to file\nand product [sic] briefs\" in his criminal case and unable to\nconduct discovery in his civil rights cases while in\nadministrative segregation at S.C.I. Greene. App. at 10. His\ncomplaint seeks relief in the form of compensation damages\nand punitive damages. In his briefs he asserts that he also\nseeks injunctive and declaratory relief.\n\nOn September 29, 1997, before service of the complaint,\nthe Magistrate Judge recommended that the complaint be\ndismissed for failure to state a claim, stating:\n\n       In Sandin v. Connor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's Report\nand Recommendation as the opinion of the court and\nordered the complaint dismissed. Allah timely appealed.\n\n                               3\n\fThis court appointed counsel to represent Allah on appeal.1\nWe also requested that the Commonwealth submit a brief\nand argue as amicus curiae.2 The appeal was consolidated\nwith another brought by Allah in a separate case captioned\nAllah v. Al-Hafeez, No. 98-1385. The two consolidated\nappeals present distinct legal issues, and we address the\nissues in separate opinions.\n\nOur review of the District Court's sua sponte dismissal\nfor failure to state a claim, which was authorized by 28\nU.S.C.

Frackville and S.C.I.\nGraterford. The District Court interpreted Sandin to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. We expressed our appreciation to this firm and others in note 4 of the\ncompanion opinion in Allah v. Al-Hafeez, No. 98-1385.\n\n2. A motions panel of this court requested that the parties address\nseveral additional issues in their briefs, including, inter alia, whether\nany\nor all of Allah's claims are moot, whether Allah has exhausted available\nadministrative remedies in accordance with 42 U.S.C.S 1997e(a),\nwhether Allah's claims seeking monetary damages are barred by 42\nU.S.C. S 1997e(e), and what standard should be applied to a claim\nalleging retaliation for exercising the right to petition the courts. For\nthe\nmost part, those issues are not directly presented by this appeal, and we\naccordingly do not decide them here. As for mootness, a jurisdictional\nissue, it is clear, and the parties do not dispute, that at least Allah's\nclaims for damages survive his release from administrative segregation.\nSee Weaver v. Wilcox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390901\"><a href=\"/opinion/390901/weaver-francis-eugene-and-the-inmates-of-tioga-county-prison-v-wilcox/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 n.13 (3d Cir. 1981) (stating that\nprisoner's transfer from the prison moots claim for injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief with respect to prison conditions but not claim for\ndamages).\n\n                               4\n\fpreclude both of these claims, apparently in the belief that\nSandin stands for the principle that no claim arising out of\nadministrative segregation can form the basis for a\nconstitutional violation. We cannot agree with that\ninterpretation of Sandin.\n\nSandin involved a S 1983 suit brought by a state prisoner\nagainst several prison officials alleging that they had\nviolated his constitutional right to procedural due process\nby sentencing him to disciplinary segregation without\npermitting him to call certain witnesses. See 515 U.S. at\n476. The Supreme Court noted in Sandin that under the\nprocedure previously followed, if the Due Process Clause\nitself did not confer a liberty interest in a particular prison\nsituation,3 the federal courts would proceed to \"examin[e]\n. . . the possibility that the State had created a liberty\ninterest by virtue of its prison regulations. . . .\" Id. at 480\n(explaining the approach taken by the Court in Hewitt v.\nHelms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983)). The Supreme Court\nsubstantially modified that analysis in Sandin , holding that\nan examination of a state statute or regulation should not\nbe conducted unless the challenged restraint on freedom\n\"imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Id. at 484.\nAs the Court explained:\n\n       States may under certain circumstances create liberty\n       interests which are protected by the Due Process\n       Clause. But these interests will be generally limited to\n       freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding the\n       sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise\n       to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own\n       force, nonetheless imposes atypical and significant\n       hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\n       incidents of prison life.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The Court has held that the Due Process Clause confers a liberty\ninterest in certain situations. See, e.g., Washington v. Harper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112381\"><a href=\"/opinion/112381/washington-v-harper/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990) (holding that an inmate has a liberty interest in being\nprotected from the involuntary administration of psychotropic drugs);\nVitek v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110231\"><a href=\"/opinion/110231/vitek-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1980) (holding that an inmate has a liberty\ninterest in being free from involuntary transfer to mental hospital for\ntreatment).\n\n                               5\n\fId. at 483-84 (citations omitted). Applying this approach to\nthe facts of the case before it, the Court held that\"[the\nprisoner's] discipline in segregated confinement did not\npresent the type of atypical, significant deprivation in which\na State might conceivably create a liberty interest,\"\ninasmuch as \"[t]he regime to which [the prisoner] was\nsubjected . . . was within the range of confinement to be\nnormally expected for one serving an indeterminate term of\n30 years to life.\" Id. at 486-87.\n\nThe Court's opinion makes clear that the decision does\nnot foreclose other claims challenging the constitutionality\nof official actions. Specifically, it states:\n\n       Prisoners . . . , of course, retain other protection from\n       arbitrary state action even within the expected\n       conditions of confinement. They may invoke the First\n       and Eighth Amendments and the Equal Protection\n       Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment where\n       appropriate, and may draw upon internal prison\n       grievance procedures and state judicial review where\n       available.\n\nId. at 487 n.11.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that Allah's claim alleging\ndenial of his constitutional right to meaningful access to\nthe courts is not foreclosed by Sandin. In fact, the\nCommonwealth concedes as much in its brief, stating that\nthe District Court \"should have\" considered that claim. See\nAmicus Br. at 27. It is well settled that prisoners have a\nconstitutional right to access to the courts, which requires\naccess to \"adequate law libraries or adequate assistance\nfrom persons trained in the law\" for filing challenges to\ncriminal sentences, both direct and collateral, and civil\nrights actions.

A claim founded on the right of access remains\nviable after Sandin.5\n\nNor does Sandin preclude Allah's claim alleging that he\nwas kept in administrative segregation in retaliation for\nfiling civil rights suits against prison officials.

At argument, the Commonwealth suggested that Allah's access to\ncourts claim should be dismissed for failure to allege actual injury, as\nrequired by Casey. Under Casey, in order to have standing to challenge\nprison conditions as denying meaningful access to the courts, a prisoner\nmust plead facts to \"demonstrate that the alleged shortcomings . . .\nhindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.\" 518 U.S. at 351.
