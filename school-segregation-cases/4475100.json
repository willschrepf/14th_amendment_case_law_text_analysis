VACCO OF\nCOUNSEL), FOR PLAINTIFFS-RESPONDENTS KEN-VIL ASSOCIATES LIMITED\nPARTNERSHIP AND AFFINITY RENEWAL DEVELOPMENT LLC.\n\nCONNORS & VILARDO LLP, BUFFALO (RANDALL D. WHITE OF COUNSEL), FOR\nPLAINTIFF-RESPONDENT ATLANTIC HOUSING FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n\n     Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Erie County (John A.\nMichalek, J.), entered March 14, 2011. The order denied defendants’\nmotion to dismiss the complaint.\n\n     It is hereby ORDERED that the order so appealed from is\nunanimously modified on the law by granting that part of defendants’\nmotion to dismiss the first and third causes of action and as modified\nthe order is affirmed without costs.\n\n     Memorandum: Plaintiffs commenced this action seeking, inter\nalia, a judgment declaring that the settlement agreement (Agreement)\nthat they entered into with defendant New York State Division of Human\nRights (Division) is void and unenforceable and a permanent injunction\nprohibiting defendants from enforcing that Agreement. In lieu of an\nanswer, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to CPLR\n3211 (a) (2) and (7) on the ground that, inter alia, Executive Law §\n298 provides the exclusive means for reviewing a final determination\nof the Division and plaintiffs failed to seek judicial review of the\ndetermination within the statute’s 60-day limitations period. Supreme\nCourt denied the motion.\n\n     We agree with defendants that, insofar as the complaint\nchallenges the Division’s authority to enter into the Agreement and\n\f                                 -2-                          1035\n                                                         CA 12-00004\n\nthe circumstances surrounding the execution of the Agreement, it\nshould be dismissed as untimely pursuant to Executive Law § 298. That\nstatute provides, in relevant part, that “[a]ny complainant,\nrespondent or other person aggrieved by . . . an order of the\n[D]ivision which makes a final disposition of a complaint may obtain\njudicial review thereof . . . in a proceeding as provided in this\nsection” (id.). Such a proceeding “must be instituted within sixty\ndays after the service of such order” (id.; see Matter of Lester v New\nYork State Off. of Parks, Recreation & Historic Preserv., 60 AD3d 680,\n681, lv denied 12 NY3d 712; Matter of Gil v New York State Div. of\nHuman Rights, 17 AD3d 365, 366). Executive Law § 298 provides the\n“exclusive means” for reviewing a determination of the Division\n(Matter of Baust v New York State Div. of Human Rights, 70 AD3d 1107,\n1108, lv denied 15 NY3d 710).\n\n     Here, the Division filed an administrative complaint against,\ninter alia, plaintiffs Ken-Vil Associates Limited Partnership (Ken-\nVil), Affinity Renewal Development LLC (Affinity), and Villa Maria\nCollege of Buffalo (Villa Maria), alleging that they were in violation\nof Executive Law §§ 296 (2-a) and 296 (5) “by developing and renting\nhousing accommodations designed to and with the effect of denying\nhousing to individuals based on, inter alia, their familial status,\nrace, and/or age, and which unlawfully perpetuates segregation and\nseparation in the State of New York.” Ken-Vil, Affinity, Villa Maria\nand the Division executed a stipulated agreement pursuant to which the\nDivision agreed to withdraw the complaint without prejudice in order\nto facilitate settlement discussions. Thereafter, plaintiffs and the\nDivision entered into the Agreement at issue herein, the terms of\nwhich were incorporated into an order of the Division (Order).\nPursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Division agreed to\nterminate its investigation of plaintiffs and to amend the stipulated\nagreement to provide that the complaint was dismissed “with\nprejudice”. We thus agree with the Division that the Order “final[ly]\ndispos[ed] of [the] complaint” (§ 298), and that the statute’s 60-day\nlimitations period therefore began to run on the date the Order was\nserved.\n\n     We further agree with the Division that plaintiffs are precluded\nfrom challenging the Order, the underlying Agreement, and the\ncircumstances surrounding the execution of the Agreement because they\nfailed to commence a proceeding pursuant to Executive Law § 298 within\nthe 60-day limitations period (see id.), and because they could have,\nbut did not, raise those issues in such a proceeding (see Matter of\nTessy Plastics Corp. v State Div. of Human Rights, 47 NY2d 789, 791).\nNotably, a declaratory judgment action may not be used to extend the\nrelevant limitations period (see New York City Health & Hosps. Corp. v\nMcBarnette, 84 NY2d 194, 201, rearg denied 84 NY2d 865). We therefore\nmodify the order by dismissing the first cause of action, which\nalleges that the Agreement is void because the Division lacked the\nauthority to enter into a settlement agreement without first\ndetermining that there was probable cause to believe that plaintiffs\nengaged in an unlawful discriminating practice, and the third cause of\naction, which alleges that the Agreement is void because it was\nentered into under duress.\n\f                                 -3-                          1035\n                                                         CA 12-00004\n\n     Contrary to the contention of defendants, however, we conclude\nthat the court properly denied the Division’s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint insofar as it challenges the validity of the Agreement based\nupon events occurring after execution of the Agreement. Initially, we\nnote that defendants’ primary jurisdiction and ripeness contentions\nare not properly before us inasmuch as they are raised for the first\ntime on appeal (see Avraham v Allied Realty Corp., 8 AD3d 1079, 1079).\nIn any event, those contentions are without merit.\n\n     The doctrine of primary jurisdiction applies when the\ndetermination of an action “ ‘requires the resolution of issues which,\nunder a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special\ncompetence of an administrative body’ . . . The doctrine is intended\nto coordinate the relationship between courts and administrative\nagencies so that, among other things, the agency’s views on factual\nand technical issues are made available where the matter before the\ncourt is within the agency’s specialized field” (Matter of Donato v\nBoard of Educ. of Plainview, Old Bethpage Cent. School Dist., 286 AD2d\n388, 388, quoting United States v Western Pac. R.R. Co., 352 US 59,\n64). Thus, “in such a case[,] the judicial process is suspended\npending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its\nviews” (Matter of Langston v Iroquois Cent. School Dist., 291 AD2d\n845, 845 [internal quotation marks omitted]).\n\n     Here, plaintiffs allege in their second, fourth, and fifth causes\nof action that the Agreement is void for failure of conditions\nprecedent, frustration of purpose, and impossibility of performance\nbased upon their failure to obtain anticipated tax-exempt bond\nfinancing. There is nothing in the Human Rights Law (Executive Law §\n290 et seq.) or the Division’s Rules of Practice (9 NYCRR 465.1 et\nseq.) that places a determination of whether a settlement agreement is\nvoid on those grounds within the special competence of the Division\n(cf. Langston, 291 AD2d at 845). Instead, such a determination\nrequires the application of general contract principles rather than\nthe use of any “specialized knowledge [or] expertise” of the Division\n(Donato, 286 AD2d at 388; see generally Neumann v Wyandanch Union Free\nSchool Dist., 84 AD3d 816, 818).\n\n     We further conclude that plaintiffs’ challenges to the Agreement\nare ripe for judicial review inasmuch as the Order is final, and there\nis no administrative proceeding available to raise the issues set\nforth in the second, fourth, and fifth causes of action (see generally\nMatter of Gordon v Rush, 100 NY2d 236, 242). While plaintiffs\ntheoretically could raise those issues as defenses in a compliance\nproceeding brought by the Division, the Division has not commenced\nsuch a proceeding (see Executive Law § 297 [7]; 9 NYCRR 465.18). In\nlight of the fact that an action for a declaratory judgment is\n“governed by equitable principles” (Krieger v Krieger, 25 NY2d 364,\n370), we conclude that plaintiffs, by reason of the Division’s delay\nin seeking compliance with the Order, should not be foreclosed from\nobtaining judicial review of the second, fourth, and fifth causes of\n\f                              -4-                 1035\n                                             CA 12-00004\n\naction.\n\n\n\n\nEntered:   November 9, 2012         Frances E.
