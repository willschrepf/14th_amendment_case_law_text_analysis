The jury convicted Delgado of five counts of committing a lewd act on\na child under age 14 (Pen. Code, § 288, subd. (a)) and two counts of committing a lewd\nact on a child age 14 or 15 (id., subd. (c)(1)). The trial court sentenced Delgado to\nconcurrent terms of 15 years to life on the first five counts, plus a determinate term of 4\nyears for the latter two counts.\n       On appeal, Delgado takes issue with the trial court’s evidentiary rulings\nconcerning the impeachment of witnesses. More specifically, he claims the trial court\nerred in (1) sanitizing the felony convictions of all witnesses, (2) not allowing\nimpeachment of a prosecution witness with her prior misdemeanor convictions while\nallowing Delgado to be impeached with his prior misdemeanor conduct, (3) excluding a\nprior claim of rape by a prosecution witness, and (4) ruling that a defense witness could\nbe impeached with prior convictions of crimes involving moral turpitude. We find no\nabuse of discretion in the trial court’s evidentiary rulings and affirm.\n\n\n                                FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n\nA. Prosecution\n       1. Introduction\n       Delgado met Leslie B. in 1996 or 1997. Leslie had two daughters: A., who was\nborn in 1990, and S., who was born in 1996. As children, A. lived with her grandparents\nand S. lived with her father.\n       Delgado and Leslie had a daughter, L., who was born in 2000, and a younger son.\nDelgado and Leslie married in 2006.\n       Leslie struggled with methamphetamine addiction most of her adult life. She had\ncommitted numerous crimes, been convicted of many felonies, and been in jail or prison\nmultiple times.\n\n                                              2\n\f       Leslie was in prison from October 2008 through February 2010. She was again\nconvicted of felonies in 2012 and began a jail sentence in August 2012.\n\n\n       2. Crimes Against A.\n       In 2001 and 2002, when A. was 12 years old, A. visited Leslie and Delgado at\ntheir home in Bell Gardens. During one of those visits, A. was alone with Delgado in the\nliving room after Leslie had gone to bed. Delgado pulled A. on top of him, so that she\nwas straddling him, and inserted his penis in her vagina. She felt “ripping on the inside.”\nThe next morning she was still in pain and saw bruises, and she subsequently suffered\nfrom a bladder infection. She did not tell anyone about the incident because she was\nafraid of Delgado.\n       In 2004 and 2005, when A. was 14 years old, there was one occasion when she\nand Delgado were in the garage together, and he reached toward her breasts and touched\nher. When she “freaked out,” he told her that he was trying to rub her shoulders. On\nseveral other occasions, Delgado grabbed A.’s buttocks. One time he joked that he\ngrabbed A. thinking that she was Leslie, but A. did not believe him. She was terrified of\nhim and did not say anything about the incidents.\n       Anthony Barela began dating A. in 2008. She told him that “things happened that\nshe was scared to tell anybody about,” because Delgado “had told her that if she ever said\nanything that he would kill her mother[, Leslie].” In 2009, A. told Barela that Delgado\nhad raped her, and she eventually described what had happened. She was shaking and\ncrying. She made Barela swear not to tell anyone about it.\n\n\n       3. Crimes Against S.\n       In 2003, when S. was seven years old, she visited Leslie and Delgado at their\nhome. She sometimes slept between Leslie and Delgado in their bed. Once, while Leslie\nwas asleep, Delgado reached under S.’s nightgown and underpants and rubbed her\nvagina.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       At another time when S. was in bed with Leslie and Delgado, he grabbed S.’s hand\nand put it on his penis. When she realized what she was touching, she closed her hand so\nshe would not have to touch it anymore.\n       On another occasion, when S. was between seven and nine years old, she and\nDelgado were in a van in traffic. Delgado reached over and put his hand in S.’s pants.\nShe attempted to get away from him by crouching down on the floor.\n       S. did not tell anyone about these incidents because she was disgusted and\nembarrassed by them. When she was 13 or 14 years old, S. required a physical\nexamination in order to participate in sports at school. She had to fill out a form that\nasked whether she had ever been forced or pressured to have sex; she checked the box for\n“yes.” She subsequently spoke to law enforcement officers about the incidents with\nDelgado.\n\n\n       4. Crimes Against L.\n       In 2009 and 2010, when L. was nine years old, she lived with Delgado in Norwalk\nwhile Leslie was in prison. On one occasion, Delgado hit L. on her bare buttocks with a\nleather belt. L. was in pain for about two days.\n       One night, L. went to Delgado’s bedroom at about 2:00 a.m. because she had a\nbad dream and was afraid of ghosts. She got into bed with him. Delgado pushed her\nclose to him in a way that made her uncomfortable. He reached under her underwear and\nrubbed her vagina. L. was scared. The next day, Delgado told L., “You know what\nwould happen if you tell on me.” L. believed he meant that something bad would\nhappen.\n       L. did not tell anyone what happened because she believed Delgado would do\nsomething to hurt her or Leslie. She was afraid of him, because she had seen him hit\nLeslie in the past and make her bleed. L. did not say anything to Leslie about the\nincidents after Leslie was released from custody because she did not want anything bad to\nhappen.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       At some point after Leslie was released from custody, she and L. were living in a\nmotel in Orange County. Leslie was arrested at the motel and jailed. After her release,\nshe and L. moved into a domestic violence shelter.\n       On August 3, 2010, L. was living with A. and A.’s father in Huntington Beach. L.\nfound out that a court had ordered her returned to Delgado’s custody. She began to cry\nand told A. that she would rather kill herself than live with Delgado. A. called 911 and\nreported that L. had threatened to kill herself if she had to go back to Delgado.\n       An emergency meeting at the Department of Children and Family Services\n(Department) was held the following day. L. and Leslie attended, as well as Delgado’s\ndaughter from a previous marriage, Brianna. L. first described physical abuse by\nDelgado. L. did not say that she was molested because she was afraid Brianna would tell\nDelgado, and he would hurt L. After the meeting, L. was placed in foster care. L.\neventually told another social worker about the molestation so she would not be returned\nto Delgado.\n\n\n       5. The Investigation\n       On September 10, 2010, Detective Rudy Acevedo of the Los Angeles County\nSheriff’s Department interviewed S. at her home. S. described three incidents of\nmolestation: Once she went into Delgado’s bedroom when she had a bad dream; as she\nwas sleeping between Delgado and Leslie, Delgado put his hand under her clothes and\nrubbed her vagina. The same thing happened a second time, but Delgado took her hand\nand tried to force her to touch his penis; she closed her hand to avoid touching it. The\nthird time was when they were driving in traffic and he reached over, put his hand inside\nher underwear, and rubbed her vagina. She “scooted down” to the floor to escape him.\nAll three incidents occurred when she was seven or eight years old.\n       Acevedo interviewed L. on September 13, 2010. L. appeared nervous and started\nto cry when the detective asked her about Delgado. L. told him that Delgado was mean\nto her and disciplined her harshly. Once he pulled her pants down and spanked her on\nher bare bottom with a belt. This caused welts and bruises, and she could not sit down\n\n                                             5\n\ffor several days or a week. L. also described violent conduct between Delgado and\nLeslie. Acevedo asked L. about the molestation, and she told him, “I can’t talk about\nthat. I’m afraid he’s going to kill me or my mother.” L. eventually told Acevedo that\nonce she went to Delgado’s bedroom after having a bad dream. Delgado rubbed the sides\nof her pelvic area, then put his hands on her vagina and rubbed it. He then told her, “You\nbetter not tell anybody.”\n       Acevedo interviewed A. on September 20, 2010. Once he started asking her about\nDelgado, A. became panicky; she was shaking and crying and had difficulty breathing.\nShe told him she was unable to talk about what happened and needed counseling.\n       Based on the interviews with S. and L., Acevedo caused Delgado to be arrested on\nSeptember 24, 2010. Acevedo re-interviewed S. and L., and they gave statements similar\nto their previous ones. He also telephoned A. and told her that Delgado had been arrested\nand his bail was $2 million. She agreed to meet with him.\n       Acevedo met with A. on September 27, 2010. A. told him that when she was in\nthe living room watching television, Delgado came in, picked her up and placed her on\nhis penis. It was very painful, and she was ripping and tearing inside. The next morning\nshe felt very sore and had bruises inside her thighs. Later that week, she had a urinary\ntract infection. During the interview, A. was shaking and crying, and Acevedo believed it\nwas very difficult for her to talk about what happened.\n\n\n       6. Expert Testimony\n       Sergeant Daniel Scott of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department had\nworked with the Special Victims Bureau for 25 years and testified as an expert witness.\nHe testified that it is rare for a child to tell anyone immediately after being molested. A\nchild may delay disclosure of molestation for months or years. This may be due to fear\nof retaliation, blame and isolation. If the molester had exhibited a pattern of violence in\nfront of the child, this would contribute to the child’s failure to disclose the molestation.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       Scott testified that, based on his experience, there is no typical way for a child to\nreact to molestation. Children do not remember time like an adult, and it is common for\nchildren to give inconsistent reports of molestation.\n       Scott did not know anything about this particular case. He had not read any of the\nreports or spoken to anyone about the case.\n\n\n       7. Additional Evidence\n       In 2004,1 Delgado used his van to ram Leslie’s car while she and L. were inside.\nHe screamed at Leslie and stomped on the hood of the car. When she tried to run away,\nDelgado grabbed the back of her jacket and tore it. He was arrested.\n       On July 13, 2010, after having been absent from the Norwalk home he shared with\nLeslie for two weeks, Delgado returned home. The locks on the house had been changed\nbecause Leslie was afraid of him. Delgado was upset that the locks had been changed\nand he attempted to kick in the door. A.’s boyfriend stood by at the door and told A. to\ntake the children in the home into another room and call Leslie. Delgado managed to\nenter the house, holding a screwdriver. A.’s boyfriend did not try to stop Delgado,\nbecause he thought Delgado might try to stab him with the screwdriver. Delgado\ngrabbed the children out of the other room, and A. called 911.\n       Leslie rushed home in response to A.’s call. When she arrived, she saw Delgado\nattempting to drag the children out of the house. The children screamed and ran to\nLeslie. The children then got into Leslie’s car, and she attempted to shut the door after\nthem. Delgado grabbed the car door and forced Leslie into the corner of the door. He\nraised the screwdriver above his head and Leslie screamed, believing she was about to\ndie. Instead, Delgado punctured all four of her tires and threw her keys away.\n       Another time, A.’s boyfriend tried to intervene during an argument between\nDelgado and Leslie. He told them that they should calm down because the children were\n\n\n1     Leslie could not remember exactly when this incident occurred and testified it may\nhave been in 2003.\n\n\n                                              7\n\fpresent. Delgado ignored him, yelling at Leslie and pushing her against a wall. When\nA.’s boyfriend begged him to stop fighting in front of the children, Delgado told him,\n“Don’t . . . tell me how to run my . . . family. Get the hell out of here.” Delgado then\nchallenged A.’s boyfriend to a fight.\n       Leslie denied knowing anything about what Delgado had done to A. or S. until\nSeptember 2010, when he was arrested. She also denied telling the girls to make up\nmolestation claims against Delgado in order to help L. get away from him. She said she\nwould not do that and put a child through the turmoil of testifying about a sexual assault\nin front of a room full of strangers.\n       S. testified that she would not lie to help either Leslie or L. A. testified that she\nwould not lie for Leslie, and she doubted if Leslie would lie for her. She acknowledged,\nhowever, that when she was 15 Leslie helped her get a false identification card so she\ncould get into casinos and drink in Las Vegas. A. also testified that she would not\nfabricate allegations of sexual abuse by Delgado in order to help L.\n       While Delgado was in custody, he wrote love letters to Leslie. He wrote about his\nmemories of their love. He made a notation of bible verses, 1 Corinthians 7:10-11,\ncommanding a wife not to leave her husband and, if she does leave, to remain unmarried\nor be reconciled to her husband.\n       Delgado also made telephone calls to his first wife, Lynette, from jail. These calls\nwere recorded. He told Lynette that she needed to talk to their 14-year-old daughter,\nBrianna, because “she is the only one that could . . . convince [L.] to change her . . . story.\n[Brianna] needs to because [L.] is sticking to her guns . . . .”\n\n\nB. Defense\n       1. Delgado’s Testimony\n       Delgado never molested A., S., or L. He testified that A. visited his home in 2002,\nbut she never spent the night there. S. never slept in the same bed with him and Leslie.\nHe once drove S. to her father’s home in his car; he did not use his van because her father\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\flived some distance away and the van used too much gas. L. came into his room and\nslept with him five or six times while Leslie was in prison.\n       Delgado admitted that during a jailhouse telephone conversation with Lynette, he\ntalked about getting L. to change her story. He did this because L.’s story was a lie.\n       When Delgado lived with Leslie, they occasionally argued. He got into an\naltercation with her in 2004 that resulted in him being jailed. Leslie bailed him out of jail\nlater that day. According to Delgado, he did not ram Leslie’s car with his van. Rather,\nhe blocked her car from leaving because she was drunk and was taking L. He did not\ndamage her car or chase after her. The police sprayed him with pepper spray while he\nwas trying to protect L.2\n       On cross-examination, Delgado acknowledged that in the past he had used\ndifferent social security numbers and had given law enforcement a different name.\nHowever, he considered himself to be a mostly truthful and honest person.\n\n\n       2. Delgado’s Family Members\n       Brianna testified that Delgado never struck or molested her. In her opinion, he\nwas an honest person. Brianna recalled an incident in which Delgado attacked Leslie’s\ncar with a screwdriver, but she never saw him use the screwdriver to attack a person.\n       Samantha C. was Delgado’s stepdaughter. He began taking care of her when she\nwas two years old. Delgado never did anything to Samantha “physically,” and she\nbelieved him to be truthful and honest. Samantha spent time with L. in 2009 and 2010.\nL. never told Samantha that Delgado had molested her.\n       Delgado’s sister, Elizabeth Boland, testified that he had a good reputation for\nhonesty.\n\n\n\n\n2      The parties stipulated during trial that on March 25, 2004, Delgado pled no contest\nto misdemeanor domestic violence (Pen. Code, § 273.5) and endangering a child (id.,\n§ 273) based on this incident.\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       3. Other Witnesses\n       Lisa Alford was a social worker for the Department. When she interviewed A., A.\ndid not say she had been molested. When she interviewed L., L. said Delgado cursed at\nher, made her do the dishes and called her stupid. L. said she reported the molestation to\nan afterschool program teacher, Jacqueline Ramirez. Teachers are required by law to\nreport child molestation. Alford could find no such report by Ramirez.\n       Ramirez testified that L. was one of her former students. L. never told her about\nany molestation.\n       Dr. Melanie Blumenthal was L.’s doctor from February to August 2010. L. never\ntold the doctor about any molestation.\n       Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Raymond Ybarra spoke to L. on August 4,\n2010 at the Department office. L. denied that Delgado ever hit her. She said he spanked\nher when she misbehaved.\n       Marianna Yamamoto, a dependency investigator for the Department, spoke to L.\non August 11, 2010. L. was tearful and anxious. She said she wanted to live with Leslie,\nnot with Delgado. L. told Yamamoto that Delgado had fondled her once, on top of her\nclothing. Yamamoto also spoke to S., who said Delgado had touched her “private area”\nwhile she slept between him and Leslie.\n       San Bernardino County Deputy Sheriff Randy Rouse interviewed S. on August 25,\n2010. S. said that Delgado touched her between 5 and 10 times; she was not certain how\nmany. They occurred at home, in Delgado’s van, and when she was in bed with Delgado\nand Leslie.\n       Buena Park Police Detective Christopher Nyhus spoke to Leslie on July 21, 2010.\nIn the course of a search, he found a glass pipe used to smoke methamphetamine. Leslie\nsaid the pipe did not belong to her. She said she had smoked methamphetamine in the\npast but had quit and had not used it in about a month.\n       4. Expert Testimony\n       Dr. Ronald Markman, a psychiatrist, evaluated Delgado to determine whether he\nhad a psychiatric condition that made him a potential danger to society, and whether he\n\n                                            10\n\fhad a predilection for sexual misconduct with children. It was Markman’s opinion\nDelgado did not suffer from a major axis one psychiatric condition, which would include\nschizophrenia, bipolar disorder, manic depressive disease, or anxiety disorders. Based on\nthe testing done, Markham found “there is not enough data to firmly conclude that there\nwas or there was not sexual misconduct.”\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\nA. Restriction of Delgado’s Impeachment of Leslie\n       Delgado and Leslie both had prior felony and misdemeanor convictions. Delgado\ncontends the trial court erroneously restricted his impeachment of Leslie to her prior\nfelony convictions, while allowing him to be impeached by both his prior felony and\nmisdemeanor convictions. He claims this disparate treatment violated his Sixth and\nFourteenth Amendment rights to confront witnesses against him, present a defense, and\nto a fair trial. As we discuss below, the trial court’s evidentiary rulings as to\nimpeachment were correct and did not violate Delgado’s constitutional rights.\n\n\n       1. Proceedings Below\n              a. Pretrial Proceedings\n       Prior to trial, the prosecutor raised the issue of Leslie’s impeachment with her\nprior convictions. First was a conviction of possession for sale of a controlled substance.\nThe trial court ruled the defense could elicit evidence “she was convicted of a crime\ninvolving moral turpitude. The point is . . . do not . . . indicate what the crime is.” The\ncourt made the same ruling for a 2000 conviction for possession for sale, 2010\nconvictions for possession of controlled substances and welfare fraud, and 2011\nconvictions for 14 counts of fraud and perjury.\n       The defense wanted to introduce evidence of Leslie’s July 21, 2010 arrest, and that\nafter she was released from jail, she “became aware of the investigation by the\n[Department] about her drug usage.” The trial court ruled that if Leslie was convicted,\n\n                                              11\n\fdefense counsel could refer to her conviction. Otherwise, the evidence was inadmissible.\nDefense counsel objected that the evidence was “a very big part of [the] defense.” The\ntrial court responded, “You can present it otherwise. Just—I’m not saying that you can’t\ncross-examine her about it. You can.” The same was true of evidence “Leslie . . . was\nordered to return to [the] probation office but didn’t appear” after her release.\n\n\n              b. Direct Examination of Leslie\n       During Leslie’s direct examination, while the prosecutor was questioning her as to\nwhy she returned to Delgado after the car-ramming incident, defense counsel requested a\nsidebar. Defense counsel stated, “Your honor, I thought that we’re going to talk about\nconvictions and not go into these cases at length. This particular case occurred in 2004.\nIt was a misdemeanor. I will admit the misdemeanor. I am objecting to the facts of the\ncase, otherwise I think this court’s going to hear a lot of witnesses on both sides and—\nhe’s charged with child molesting. I can see the relevancy [of] him being convicted in a\nmoral turpitude crime, but to go into every—if that’s the case—if the court wants me, I\ncan go into every fact of everything that she’s ever done.”\n       The trial court reiterated: “Look. We’re not going to have any testimony as to the\ncrimes that were committed either by Leslie . . . or by [Delgado].” Both could be\nimpeached with prior felony convictions involving moral turpitude. “But, on the other\nhand, you’re not to discuss or ask questions or elicit answers of what either Leslie . . . or\n[Delgado] were found guilty of.” The trial court stated that the ruling reflected a balance\nstruck by the court.\n       Defense counsel asked to have an Evidence Code section 402 hearing on the issue\nof Leslie’s felony convictions. The trial court stated that it had already held such a\nhearing but allowed defense counsel to make a record. Defense counsel explained that\nafter Leslie went to jail on June 30th, 2010, she learned of 14 felony charges against her\nfor welfare fraud, grand theft and perjury. Defense counsel believed he had “a right to\ndisclose these thefts and perjuries because” in pleading guilty, Leslie admitted she was a\nthief and a liar. The trial court stated that it had already ruled on the matter, and its ruling\n\n                                              12\n\fwas going to stand; defense counsel could not refer to the specific offenses. However,\nthe court would allow defense counsel to question Leslie regarding certain of her\nhandwritten notes, which he argued constituted admissions that she was a liar and a thief.\n\n\n              c. Cross-Examination of Leslie\n       During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Leslie if she was convicted of a\nmisdemeanor on July 21, 1997. The prosecutor’s objection was sustained. Defense\ncounsel attempted to ask Leslie about felony convictions, but the prosecutor’s objections\nwere sustained on the ground the information was to be provided to the jury by\nstipulation. In a conversation outside the presence of the jury, the trial court reiterated\nthat “we’re not going to talk about the misdemeanors.” Defense counsel protested that it\nwas a conviction of petty theft, which is a crime of moral turpitude. The trial court again\nstated that it was not going to allow impeachment with misdemeanors, only felonies.3\n       Defense counsel requested that he be allowed to impeach Leslie with convictions\nof possession for sale of a controlled substance. The prosecutor sought to exclude the\nconvictions because they were more than 10 years old, but the trial court stated that it\nwould allow the impeachment. Defense counsel also agreed to a stipulation that Leslie\nsustained three felony convictions prior to 2001. The court noted that “in addition to that,\n\n\n\n3       Delgado does not clearly distinguish here (and did not do so in the trial court)\nbetween impeachment by the fact of conviction versus the underlying misdemeanor\nconduct. The prosecutor was clear throughout that she intended to impeach by eliciting\ntestimony about the conduct underlying the misdemeanor convictions. The prosecutor\nrepeatedly referenced conduct and not convictions. The prosecutor began her cross-\nexamination of Delgado not by asking him about misdemeanor convictions, but instead\nwhether he had given a false name to law enforcement and used four other people’s\nsocial security numbers. In the trial court, Delgado’s counsel never distinguished\nbetween conduct and convictions and referred generally only to misdemeanors.\nDelgado’s counsel argued that the court did not permit him the same latitude as the\nprosecutor. The court, however, merely excluded evidence of the misdemeanor\nconviction and not the underlying conduct. The misdemeanor conviction the jury did\nlearn of was pursuant to the parties’ stipulation.\n\n\n                                              13\n\fthe parties have agreed that prior to 2002 that [Leslie] sustained three felony\nconvictions, . . . and that in 2007 [she] also sustained a felony conviction.”\n       Defense counsel later cross-examined Leslie about her arrest at the Orange County\nmotel, when L. was present with her. During a break in the proceedings, defense counsel\nstated that he was “laying a foundation for impeachment. . . . I’m not going into her\nconvictions.” He wanted to impeach her with evidence she lied to the police officer when\nshe said she was not currently using drugs. The trial court ruled that defense counsel\ncould question Leslie about the incident to determine whether she lied to the authorities,\nand he could mention the arrest insofar as it was necessary to provide background\ninformation. However the court would admonish the jury that “[a] mere arrest in this\ncase has no bearing on [Leslie’s] truthfulness.”4\n\n\n              d. Defense Case\n       Prior to presentation of the defense case, the prosecutor stated that when\nDelgado’s “character witnesses do testify, I intend to impeach them. Impeach them with\nstatements they’ve made. And also I’m permitted to go into misdemeanor conduct of\n[Delgado]. Not the fact of conviction, but misdemeanor conduct. I wanted to explicitly\nsay that that’s in the code.” Defense counsel objected that he had not “been able to do\n\n\n\n4       The court then instructed the jury: “An arrest in and of itself is not any evidence\nof misconduct or evidence that can be used to test the veracity, the truthfulness, of a\nwitness. Convictions that involve moral turpitude can be used as a consideration by you,\nif you wish to, for impeachment purposes. “Now, back to the time frame where—in\nsome time around June 30th, 2010, there is evidence that [Leslie and L.] . . . were living\nin the Red Roof Inn . . . and that she was arrested, she’s testified outside of the room.\nNow, the fact that she’s arrested cannot be considered by you at all. And if she’s charged\nand even convicted of a crime that doesn’t involve moral turpitude, you can’t consider\nthat for impeachment purposes either. However, if the testimony should be and may not\nbe—we haven’t heard it as yet—that she may have lied to a government official and then\nlater told another story, it can be considered along with all the circumstances under which\nit was told, of which you should consider whether or not under the circumstances it really\nmatters for impeachment purposes to you or it doesn’t.”\n\n\n                                             14\n\fthat on misdemeanors as to character of Leslie . . . . I’ve been told and informed that\nyou’re not talking about anything but felonies by this court.”\n       The trial court stated that it did not know what the prosecutor intended to prove,\nand reiterated that it would not allow impeachment with misdemeanor offenses. The\ncourt added that if the conduct “is far more prejudicial than it is probative I can always\nfall back on that and that’s my call.”\n       During presentation of the defense case, defense counsel told the court that before\nhe decided whether to call Delgado as a witness, he wanted to find out what information\nabout Delgado’s past the prosecution intended to cover. The prosecutor told the court\nthat she would be asking Delgado about the “underlying conduct of misdemeanors of\nmoral turpitude,” including assault, grand theft, violating a restraining order and giving\nfalse information to the police, “which are crimes of moral turpitude.”\n       Defense counsel protested that the trial court did not allow him to impeach Leslie\nwith misdemeanors involving moral turpitude but only with felonies. The trial court\nexplained, “This is different. This is the defendant testifying. And if the crimes are\ncrimes involving moral turpitude, whether misdemeanors or felonies, you’re able to\nmention the crime. We’re not going to go into any detail about the crime.” The court\nthen agreed with the prosecutor that she could ask about “the underlying circumstances of\nthe misdemeanor” if it involved Leslie or another witness, as long as the crime involved\nmoral turpitude. However, it would exercise its discretion to exclude such evidence if an\nincident “was so far back in time as in the court’s view not to be relevant.”\n       At the start of the prosecutor’s cross-examination of Delgado, she asked him\nwhether he “ever used any other name to law enforcement” and “ever used at least four\nother people’s social security numbers in your past.” Delgado responded that he had.\n       During redirect, outside of the presence of the jury, the prosecutor brought up the\nissue of Delgado’s no contest plea to misdemeanor committing corporal injury to a\nspouse. When defense counsel protested, the prosecutor responded that Delgado “lied on\nthe stand and denied that he even did anything, but yet he [pled] to it.” Despite defense\ncounsel’s reservations based upon the court’s limitations on Leslie’s impeachment,\n\n                                             15\n\fcounsel agreed to stipulate to a no contest plea to a domestic violence charge. Defense\ncounsel then stipulated in front of the jury “that the defendant [pled] no contest to\nmisdemeanor domestic violence, Penal Code section 273.5, corporal injury to spouse,\ncohabitant or child’s parent, and that he also [pled] no contest in the same information,\nsame case, to endangering a child, a violation of Penal Code section 273[, subdivisions]\n(a) [and] (b) . . . in 2004.”\n\n\n       2. Admission of Prior Felony Convictions for Impeachment Purposes\n       In general, “‘[t]he trial courts have broad discretion to admit or exclude prior\nconvictions for impeachment purposes . . . . The discretion is as broad as necessary to\ndeal with the great variety of factual situations in which the issue arises, and in most\ninstances the appellate courts will uphold its exercise whether the conviction is admitted\nor excluded.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Hinton (2006) 37 Cal.4th 839, 887.)\n       The California Constitution “‘provides in pertinent part that “[a]ny prior felony\nconviction . . . shall subsequently be used without limitation for purposes of impeachment\n. . . in any criminal proceeding.”’ [Citation.]” (People v. Edwards (2013) 57 Cal.4th\n658, 723; see Cal. Const., art. I, § 28, subd. (f).) The Supreme Court has held that this\nprovision “‘“authorizes the use of any felony conviction which necessarily involves\nmoral turpitude, even if the immoral trait is one other than dishonesty.”’ [Citation.]”\n(Edwards, supra, at pp. 723-724.) However, admission of a prior felony conviction for\nimpeachment purposes is subject to the trial court’s exercise of discretion under Evidence\nCode section 352. (Edwards, supra, at p. 723.)\n       “‘The scope of inquiry when a criminal defendant is impeached with evidence of a\nprior felony conviction does not extend to the facts of the underlying offense.’\n[Citation.]” (People v. Shea (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1257, 1267; see People v. Edwards,\nsupra, 57 Cal.4th at pp. 721, 723.) The trial court may exercise discretion and “sanitize”\nthe prior convictions, i.e., allow impeachment with felonies involving moral turpitude\nwithout allowing the jury to know the specific crimes resulting in the convictions. (See\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\fPeople v. Sandoval (1992) 4 Cal.4th 155, 177-178; People v. Mickle (1991) 54 Cal.3d\n140, 172; People v. Ballard (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 687, 696.)\n       The record shows that, with respect to prior felony convictions, the trial court\nruled as to all witnesses the fact and number of prior felony convictions involving moral\nturpitude would be admissible for impeachment purposes. This was permissible, and\nDelgado does not specifically challenge this ruling.\n       Moreover, both Leslie’s and Delgado’s prior felony convictions involving moral\nturpitude were admissible for impeachment purposes, and the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in ruling them admissible. (People v. Edwards, supra, 57 Cal.4th at p. 722.)\nWe also perceive no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s decision to sanitize Leslie’s\nand Delgado’s prior felony convictions. The court’s decision reflected the balance that it\nstruck. Because the jury was well aware that Leslie had numerous prior convictions\ninvolving moral turpitude, the procedure did not result in Leslie being clothed with a\nfalse aura of veracity. (People v. Chavez (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 25, 28; People v.\nMendoza (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 918, 927.)\n\n\n       3. Admission of Prior Misdemeanors for Impeachment Purposes\n       “‘[I]f past criminal conduct amounting to a misdemeanor has some logical bearing\nupon the veracity of a witness in a criminal proceeding, that conduct is admissible,\nsubject to trial court discretion . . . .’ (People v. Wheeler (1992) 4 Cal.4th 284, 295 . . . .)\n‘When the witness subject to impeachment is not the defendant, those factors [guiding the\ncourt’s discretion] prominently include whether the conviction (1) reflects on honesty and\n(2) is near in time.’ (People v. Clair (1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 654 . . . .)[5] However, ‘the\nlatitude [Evidence Code] section 352 allows for exclusion of impeachment evidence in\n\n\n\n5      By contrast, when determining whether to allow impeachment with a felony\nconviction remote in time, the prejudice side of the balance is weighted more heavily\nwhen the witness being impeached is the defendant. (People v. Woodard (1979) 23\nCal.3d 329, 337-338.)\n\n\n                                               17\n\findividual cases is broad. The statute empowers courts to prevent criminal trials from\ndegenerating into nitpicking wars of attrition over collateral credibility issues.’\n(Wheeler[, supra,] at p. 296.) ‘“[C]ourts may and should consider with particular care\nwhether the admission of such evidence might involve undue time, confusion, or\nprejudice which outweighs its probative value.”’ (People v. Clark (2011) 52 Cal.4th 856,\n932 . . . .)” (People v. Leonard (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 465, 497.)\n       One caveat in deciding whether to exclude evidence of misdemeanor conduct is\nthat the exclusion of such evidence should not be allowed to clothe a witness in a false\naura of veracity. (People v. Chavez, supra, 84 Cal.App.4th at p. 28; see People v. Beagle\n(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441, 453; People v. Gray (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 635, 641.)\nUnquestionably, this was not an issue as far as Leslie was concerned. She was\nimpeached with multiple prior felony convictions. In addition, the trial court allowed the\ndefense to cross-examine her regarding whether she lied to authorities around the time of\nher arrest in 2010, because that would reflect on her credibility. Thus, despite the ruling\nthat Leslie could not be impeached with prior misdemeanor convictions, the trial court\nallowed Delgado to examine her conduct which reflected on her veracity.\n       The trial court stated that it would allow the prosecutor to impeach Delgado with\nevidence of his conduct amounting to a misdemeanor, but the court indicated that it\nwould exercise its discretion to exclude such evidence if an incident “was so far back in\ntime as in the court’s view not to be relevant.” The prosecutor briefly questioned\nDelgado regarding his previous use of false names and social security numbers. She also\nasked him about his no contest plea to charges of misdemeanor domestic violence and\nendangering a child after he testified that he did not ram Leslie’s car in the 2004 incident.\nThe use of false names and social security numbers was relevant to the issue of\ncredibility. Evidence of his no contest plea was certainly relevant to the credibility of his\ntestimony regarding the 2004 incident.\n       We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s rulings regarding impeachment\nwith prior misdemeanor conduct. Both Leslie and Delgado were impeached with prior\nfelony convictions. The trial court allowed both to be impeached with prior conduct\n\n                                              18\n\fwhich reflected directly on their credibility on the witness stand. The trial court’s\nstatement that it was going to make a distinction as to Delgado’s testimony when it came\nto impeachment with prior misdemeanor conduct was a permissible exercise of\ndiscretion. (See People v. Leonard, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 497.) More\nimportantly, in restricting Leslie’s impeachment with prior misdemeanor conduct, the\ncourt did not allow Leslie to be given a false aura of veracity (People v. Chavez, supra,\n84 Cal.App.4th at p. 28), as it allowed cross-examination into her credibility.\n\n\n       4. Constitutional Claims\n       We reject Delgado’s claim that he was denied a fair trial by the court’s\n“segregating prosecution from defense and putting the thumb wholesale on the\nGovernment’s side of the scale.” As discussed above, the trial court’s rulings with\nrespect to impeachment of Leslie and Delgado were, for the most part, similar. To the\nextent the trial court ruled Delgado, but not Leslie, could be impeached with prior\nmisdemeanor conduct, no prejudice resulted, as Delgado was allowed to question Leslie\nregarding conduct which directly reflected on her credibility. The trial court did not\nunfairly tip the balance of the trial in favor of the prosecution.\n       Moreover, exclusion of evidence “of marginal impeachment value . . . does not\ncontravene a defendant’s constitutional rights to confrontation and cross-examination.”\n(People v. Brown (2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 545; People v. Leonard, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 497-498.) “Given the ample evidence regarding [Leslie’s] credibility offered at\ntrial,” Delgado has not shown that allowing additional impeachment with misdemeanor\nconduct “‘“would have produced ‘a significantly different impression of [the witness’s]\ncredibility’”’ as required to state a constitutional violation. [Citation.]” (Leonard, supra,\nat p. 498.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fB. Exclusion of Leslie’s Prior False Accusation of Rape\n       In arguing that he was prejudiced by the trial court’s rulings on impeachment,\nDelgado notes that the trial court excluded evidence that Leslie had previously “falsely\naccused [him] of rape.”\n       In a pretrial motion in limine for a ruling on the admissibility of various evidence,\nDelgado sought admission of evidence that on October 10, 2006, “Leslie made a false\naccusation that [he] raped her, after an investigation the district attorney rejected filing\nthe accusation on a lack of Leslie’s credibility.” It was the defense’s position that this\nwas evidence of a conspiracy between Leslie and the children to falsely accuse Delgado\nof sexual offenses. Defense counsel further argued, “They investigated it. They found\nthat it had no merit. . . . As a matter of fact, they couldn’t even get a hold of her. And\nwhen they did, she was with [Delgado] in court in Whittier. It was—it’s just an\nindication of what kind of person this [Leslie] is, and I think it’s very relevant . . . .” The\ntrial court reminded defense counsel to “[k]eep in mind what I said in chambers,” that\n“[s]he’s not on trial. He is on trial.”\n       It has been held that it is error to exclude evidence that the victim previously made\nfalse accusations of rape. (People v. Hayes (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1245; People v.\nBurrell-Hart (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 593, 597-600.) Such false accusations are\n“‘relevant on the issue of the molest victim’s credibility.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Tidwell\n(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1447, 1457.) Leslie was not the victim here, however; her\ndaughters were. Thus, this case does not involve “the typical scenario of a one-on-one\nsexual assault, in which victim credibility is often determinative,” and exclusion of a\nprior false accusation of rape is more likely to be an abuse of discretion. (People v.\nMiranda (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1425-1426.)\n       Moreover, Leslie’s prior accusation of rape “would have no bearing on her\ncredibility unless it was also established that [the accusation was] false. [Citation.]”\n(People v. Tidwell, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at p. 1457.) Evidence Code “[s]ection 352\nprovides: ‘The court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is\nsubstantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue\n\n                                              20\n\fconsumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the\nissues, or of misleading the jury.’ ‘[A] trial court’s exercise of discretion under Evidence\nCode section 352 will not be reversed on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse.\n[Citations.] It is also established that “‘Evidence Code section 352 must bow to the due\nprocess right of a defendant to a fair trial and his right to present all relevant evidence of\nsignificant probative value to his defense.’” [Citations.] This does not mean that an\nunlimited inquiry may be made into collateral matters; the proffered evidence must have\nmore than “slight-relevancy” to the issues presented. [Citation.] . . . [Citation.] The\nproffered evidence must be of some competent, substantial and significant value.\n[Citations.]’ [Citation.] A trial court’s exercise of discretion under [Evidence Code]\nsection 352 ‘will not be disturbed except on a showing the trial court exercised its\ndiscretion in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner that resulted in a\nmanifest miscarriage of justice. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       “[The d]efendant’s problem in showing that the trial court abused its discretion in\nexcluding the evidence concerning the prior rape [accusation] is that it is not readily\napparent that [the prior accusation was] false.” (People v. Tidwell, supra, 163\nCal.App.4th at p. 1458.) All Delgado’s proffer of evidence showed was that “they”—\neither law enforcement or the prosecuting authorities—declined to prosecute him based\non the accusation. In light of the relationship between Leslie and Delgado, that could\nhave been based on Leslie’s subsequent change of heart and refusal to cooperate just as\neasily as it could have been based on the falsity of the accusation. Admission of the\nevidence “‘would in effect force the parties to present evidence concerning [a] long-past\nsexual incident[] which never reached the point of formal charges. Such a proceeding\nwould consume considerable time, and divert the attention of the jury from the case at\nhand.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) For this reason, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\nexcluding evidence of Leslie’s prior false accusation of rape. (Ibid.; see also People v.\nLeonard, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 497.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fC. Other Arguments Made by Appellant\n         Delgado also complains that the trial court’s ruling that his former wife, Lynette,\ncould be impeached with her prior convictions involving moral turpitude prevented him\nfrom calling her as a witness. As a result, Delgado was precluded from impeaching L.\nwith Lynette’s testimony that she never saw Delgado hit L.\n         First, that Lynette never saw Delgado hit L. does not prove that he never hit her.\nSecond, as Delgado acknowledges, the prosecution was entitled to impeach Lynette with\nprior convictions involving moral turpitude. (Cal. Const., art. I, § 28, subd. (f); People v.\nEdwards, supra, 57 Cal.4th at pp. 723-724.) It matters not that Delgado intended to ask\nLynette “a single question, and elicit a single answer.” We perceive no abuse of\ndiscretion in the trial court’s ruling as it applied to Lynette.\n         Delgado also argues that “[r]estriction of Leslie’s cross-examination was\nconstitutionally noxious because it enabled the Government to portray her as a dedicated\nand well-meaning mother, someone who, while struggling with domestic violence and\ndrug addiction, was nonetheless a loving parent, concerned foremost about the welfare of\nher children—someone who, above all else, was standing up and telling the truth for her\nkids.”\n         “‘A prosecutor may make “assurances regarding the apparent honesty or reliability\nof” a witness “based on the ‘facts of [the] record and the inferences reasonably drawn\ntherefrom.’” [Citation.]’” (People v. Redd (2010) 48 Cal.4th 691, 740.) Thus, the\nprosecutor could attempt to portray Leslie “as a dedicated and well-meaning mother,”\ndespite her admitted history of drug abuse and incarceration, multiple prior convictions,\nreturn to Delgado after claimed incidences of domestic violence, and obliviousness to the\neffect of Delgado’s molestation on her children.\n         By the same token, defense counsel was entitled to argue that Leslie forced her\nchildren to lie about Delgado, and asked the jury: “Now, your question certainly is who\nwould do this to this person here and to their children? . . . What kind of a person would\ndo that? Now you’re wondering why I got into all the felonies and taking dope and all\nthat. Because this is the person.” Defense counsel pointed out that Leslie lost custody of\n\n                                               22\n\fher two older children due to her drug use, she gave birth to L. while in jail, she obtained\nfalse identification for A. for a trip to Las Vegas, and sustained multiple convictions\nduring this time period.\n       The trial court’s restriction on Leslie’s impeachment did not clothe her with “‘“a\nfalse aura of veracity”’” (People v. Chavez, supra, 84 Cal.App.4th at p. 28) or preclude\nDelgado from impeaching her with her prior convictions and dishonest conduct. It was\nnot “constitutionally noxious.” (See People v. Brown, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 545; People\nv. Leonard, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 497-498.)\n\n\n                                      DISPOSITION\n\n\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                  BECKLOFF, J.*\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n              PERLUSS, P.

The jury convicted Delgado of five counts of committing a lewd act on\na child under age 14 (Pen. Code, § 288, subd. (a)) and two counts of committing a lewd\nact on a child age 14 or 15 (id., subd. (c)(1)). The trial court sentenced Delgado to\nconcurrent terms of 15 years to life on the first five counts, plus a determinate term of 4\nyears for the latter two counts.\n       On appeal, Delgado takes issue with the trial court’s evidentiary rulings\nconcerning the impeachment of witnesses. More specifically, he claims the trial court\nerred in (1) sanitizing the felony convictions of all witnesses, (2) not allowing\nimpeachment of a prosecution witness with her prior misdemeanor convictions while\nallowing Delgado to be impeached with his prior misdemeanor conduct, (3) excluding a\nprior claim of rape by a prosecution witness, and (4) ruling that a defense witness could\nbe impeached with prior convictions of crimes involving moral turpitude. We find no\nabuse of discretion in the trial court’s evidentiary rulings and affirm.\n\n\n                                FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n\nA. Prosecution\n       1. Introduction\n       Delgado met Leslie B. in 1996 or 1997. Leslie had two daughters: A., who was\nborn in 1990, and S., who was born in 1996. As children, A. lived with her grandparents\nand S. lived with her father.\n       Delgado and Leslie had a daughter, L., who was born in 2000, and a younger son.\nDelgado and Leslie married in 2006.\n       Leslie struggled with methamphetamine addiction most of her adult life. She had\ncommitted numerous crimes, been convicted of many felonies, and been in jail or prison\nmultiple times.\n\n                                              2\n\f       Leslie was in prison from October 2008 through February 2010. She was again\nconvicted of felonies in 2012 and began a jail sentence in August 2012.\n\n\n       2. Crimes Against A.\n       In 2001 and 2002, when A. was 12 years old, A. visited Leslie and Delgado at\ntheir home in Bell Gardens. During one of those visits, A. was alone with Delgado in the\nliving room after Leslie had gone to bed. Delgado pulled A. on top of him, so that she\nwas straddling him, and inserted his penis in her vagina. She felt “ripping on the inside.”\nThe next morning she was still in pain and saw bruises, and she subsequently suffered\nfrom a bladder infection. She did not tell anyone about the incident because she was\nafraid of Delgado.\n       In 2004 and 2005, when A. was 14 years old, there was one occasion when she\nand Delgado were in the garage together, and he reached toward her breasts and touched\nher. When she “freaked out,” he told her that he was trying to rub her shoulders. On\nseveral other occasions, Delgado grabbed A.’s buttocks. One time he joked that he\ngrabbed A. thinking that she was Leslie, but A. did not believe him. She was terrified of\nhim and did not say anything about the incidents.\n       Anthony Barela began dating A. in 2008. She told him that “things happened that\nshe was scared to tell anybody about,” because Delgado “had told her that if she ever said\nanything that he would kill her mother[, Leslie].” In 2009, A. told Barela that Delgado\nhad raped her, and she eventually described what had happened. She was shaking and\ncrying. She made Barela swear not to tell anyone about it.\n\n\n       3. Crimes Against S.\n       In 2003, when S. was seven years old, she visited Leslie and Delgado at their\nhome. She sometimes slept between Leslie and Delgado in their bed. Once, while Leslie\nwas asleep, Delgado reached under S.’s nightgown and underpants and rubbed her\nvagina.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       At another time when S. was in bed with Leslie and Delgado, he grabbed S.’s hand\nand put it on his penis. When she realized what she was touching, she closed her hand so\nshe would not have to touch it anymore.\n       On another occasion, when S. was between seven and nine years old, she and\nDelgado were in a van in traffic. Delgado reached over and put his hand in S.’s pants.\nShe attempted to get away from him by crouching down on the floor.\n       S. did not tell anyone about these incidents because she was disgusted and\nembarrassed by them. When she was 13 or 14 years old, S. required a physical\nexamination in order to participate in sports at school. She had to fill out a form that\nasked whether she had ever been forced or pressured to have sex; she checked the box for\n“yes.” She subsequently spoke to law enforcement officers about the incidents with\nDelgado.\n\n\n       4. Crimes Against L.\n       In 2009 and 2010, when L. was nine years old, she lived with Delgado in Norwalk\nwhile Leslie was in prison. On one occasion, Delgado hit L. on her bare buttocks with a\nleather belt. L. was in pain for about two days.\n       One night, L. went to Delgado’s bedroom at about 2:00 a.m. because she had a\nbad dream and was afraid of ghosts. She got into bed with him. Delgado pushed her\nclose to him in a way that made her uncomfortable. He reached under her underwear and\nrubbed her vagina. L. was scared. The next day, Delgado told L., “You know what\nwould happen if you tell on me.” L. believed he meant that something bad would\nhappen.\n       L. did not tell anyone what happened because she believed Delgado would do\nsomething to hurt her or Leslie. She was afraid of him, because she had seen him hit\nLeslie in the past and make her bleed. L. did not say anything to Leslie about the\nincidents after Leslie was released from custody because she did not want anything bad to\nhappen.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       At some point after Leslie was released from custody, she and L. were living in a\nmotel in Orange County. Leslie was arrested at the motel and jailed. After her release,\nshe and L. moved into a domestic violence shelter.\n       On August 3, 2010, L. was living with A. and A.’s father in Huntington Beach. L.\nfound out that a court had ordered her returned to Delgado’s custody. She began to cry\nand told A. that she would rather kill herself than live with Delgado. A. called 911 and\nreported that L. had threatened to kill herself if she had to go back to Delgado.\n       An emergency meeting at the Department of Children and Family Services\n(Department) was held the following day. L. and Leslie attended, as well as Delgado’s\ndaughter from a previous marriage, Brianna. L. first described physical abuse by\nDelgado. L. did not say that she was molested because she was afraid Brianna would tell\nDelgado, and he would hurt L. After the meeting, L. was placed in foster care. L.\neventually told another social worker about the molestation so she would not be returned\nto Delgado.\n\n\n       5. The Investigation\n       On September 10, 2010, Detective Rudy Acevedo of the Los Angeles County\nSheriff’s Department interviewed S. at her home. S. described three incidents of\nmolestation: Once she went into Delgado’s bedroom when she had a bad dream; as she\nwas sleeping between Delgado and Leslie, Delgado put his hand under her clothes and\nrubbed her vagina. The same thing happened a second time, but Delgado took her hand\nand tried to force her to touch his penis; she closed her hand to avoid touching it. The\nthird time was when they were driving in traffic and he reached over, put his hand inside\nher underwear, and rubbed her vagina. She “scooted down” to the floor to escape him.\nAll three incidents occurred when she was seven or eight years old.\n       Acevedo interviewed L. on September 13, 2010. L. appeared nervous and started\nto cry when the detective asked her about Delgado. L. told him that Delgado was mean\nto her and disciplined her harshly. Once he pulled her pants down and spanked her on\nher bare bottom with a belt. This caused welts and bruises, and she could not sit down\n\n                                             5\n\ffor several days or a week. L. also described violent conduct between Delgado and\nLeslie. Acevedo asked L. about the molestation, and she told him, “I can’t talk about\nthat. I’m afraid he’s going to kill me or my mother.” L. eventually told Acevedo that\nonce she went to Delgado’s bedroom after having a bad dream. Delgado rubbed the sides\nof her pelvic area, then put his hands on her vagina and rubbed it. He then told her, “You\nbetter not tell anybody.”\n       Acevedo interviewed A. on September 20, 2010. Once he started asking her about\nDelgado, A. became panicky; she was shaking and crying and had difficulty breathing.\nShe told him she was unable to talk about what happened and needed counseling.\n       Based on the interviews with S. and L., Acevedo caused Delgado to be arrested on\nSeptember 24, 2010. Acevedo re-interviewed S. and L., and they gave statements similar\nto their previous ones. He also telephoned A. and told her that Delgado had been arrested\nand his bail was $2 million. She agreed to meet with him.\n       Acevedo met with A. on September 27, 2010. A. told him that when she was in\nthe living room watching television, Delgado came in, picked her up and placed her on\nhis penis. It was very painful, and she was ripping and tearing inside. The next morning\nshe felt very sore and had bruises inside her thighs. Later that week, she had a urinary\ntract infection. During the interview, A. was shaking and crying, and Acevedo believed it\nwas very difficult for her to talk about what happened.\n\n\n       6. Expert Testimony\n       Sergeant Daniel Scott of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department had\nworked with the Special Victims Bureau for 25 years and testified as an expert witness.\nHe testified that it is rare for a child to tell anyone immediately after being molested. A\nchild may delay disclosure of molestation for months or years. This may be due to fear\nof retaliation, blame and isolation. If the molester had exhibited a pattern of violence in\nfront of the child, this would contribute to the child’s failure to disclose the molestation.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       Scott testified that, based on his experience, there is no typical way for a child to\nreact to molestation. Children do not remember time like an adult, and it is common for\nchildren to give inconsistent reports of molestation.\n       Scott did not know anything about this particular case. He had not read any of the\nreports or spoken to anyone about the case.\n\n\n       7. Additional Evidence\n       In 2004,1 Delgado used his van to ram Leslie’s car while she and L. were inside.\nHe screamed at Leslie and stomped on the hood of the car. When she tried to run away,\nDelgado grabbed the back of her jacket and tore it. He was arrested.\n       On July 13, 2010, after having been absent from the Norwalk home he shared with\nLeslie for two weeks, Delgado returned home. The locks on the house had been changed\nbecause Leslie was afraid of him. Delgado was upset that the locks had been changed\nand he attempted to kick in the door. A.’s boyfriend stood by at the door and told A. to\ntake the children in the home into another room and call Leslie. Delgado managed to\nenter the house, holding a screwdriver. A.’s boyfriend did not try to stop Delgado,\nbecause he thought Delgado might try to stab him with the screwdriver. Delgado\ngrabbed the children out of the other room, and A. called 911.\n       Leslie rushed home in response to A.’s call. When she arrived, she saw Delgado\nattempting to drag the children out of the house. The children screamed and ran to\nLeslie. The children then got into Leslie’s car, and she attempted to shut the door after\nthem. Delgado grabbed the car door and forced Leslie into the corner of the door. He\nraised the screwdriver above his head and Leslie screamed, believing she was about to\ndie. Instead, Delgado punctured all four of her tires and threw her keys away.\n       Another time, A.’s boyfriend tried to intervene during an argument between\nDelgado and Leslie. He told them that they should calm down because the children were\n\n\n1     Leslie could not remember exactly when this incident occurred and testified it may\nhave been in 2003.\n\n\n                                              7\n\fpresent. Delgado ignored him, yelling at Leslie and pushing her against a wall. When\nA.’s boyfriend begged him to stop fighting in front of the children, Delgado told him,\n“Don’t . . . tell me how to run my . . . family. Get the hell out of here.” Delgado then\nchallenged A.’s boyfriend to a fight.\n       Leslie denied knowing anything about what Delgado had done to A. or S. until\nSeptember 2010, when he was arrested. She also denied telling the girls to make up\nmolestation claims against Delgado in order to help L. get away from him. She said she\nwould not do that and put a child through the turmoil of testifying about a sexual assault\nin front of a room full of strangers.\n       S. testified that she would not lie to help either Leslie or L. A. testified that she\nwould not lie for Leslie, and she doubted if Leslie would lie for her. She acknowledged,\nhowever, that when she was 15 Leslie helped her get a false identification card so she\ncould get into casinos and drink in Las Vegas. A. also testified that she would not\nfabricate allegations of sexual abuse by Delgado in order to help L.\n       While Delgado was in custody, he wrote love letters to Leslie. He wrote about his\nmemories of their love. He made a notation of bible verses, 1 Corinthians 7:10-11,\ncommanding a wife not to leave her husband and, if she does leave, to remain unmarried\nor be reconciled to her husband.\n       Delgado also made telephone calls to his first wife, Lynette, from jail. These calls\nwere recorded. He told Lynette that she needed to talk to their 14-year-old daughter,\nBrianna, because “she is the only one that could . . . convince [L.] to change her . . . story.\n[Brianna] needs to because [L.] is sticking to her guns . . . .”\n\n\nB. Defense\n       1. Delgado’s Testimony\n       Delgado never molested A., S., or L. He testified that A. visited his home in 2002,\nbut she never spent the night there. S. never slept in the same bed with him and Leslie.\nHe once drove S. to her father’s home in his car; he did not use his van because her father\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\flived some distance away and the van used too much gas. L. came into his room and\nslept with him five or six times while Leslie was in prison.\n       Delgado admitted that during a jailhouse telephone conversation with Lynette, he\ntalked about getting L. to change her story. He did this because L.’s story was a lie.\n       When Delgado lived with Leslie, they occasionally argued. He got into an\naltercation with her in 2004 that resulted in him being jailed. Leslie bailed him out of jail\nlater that day. According to Delgado, he did not ram Leslie’s car with his van. Rather,\nhe blocked her car from leaving because she was drunk and was taking L. He did not\ndamage her car or chase after her. The police sprayed him with pepper spray while he\nwas trying to protect L.2\n       On cross-examination, Delgado acknowledged that in the past he had used\ndifferent social security numbers and had given law enforcement a different name.\nHowever, he considered himself to be a mostly truthful and honest person.\n\n\n       2. Delgado’s Family Members\n       Brianna testified that Delgado never struck or molested her. In her opinion, he\nwas an honest person. Brianna recalled an incident in which Delgado attacked Leslie’s\ncar with a screwdriver, but she never saw him use the screwdriver to attack a person.\n       Samantha C. was Delgado’s stepdaughter. He began taking care of her when she\nwas two years old. Delgado never did anything to Samantha “physically,” and she\nbelieved him to be truthful and honest. Samantha spent time with L. in 2009 and 2010.\nL. never told Samantha that Delgado had molested her.\n       Delgado’s sister, Elizabeth Boland, testified that he had a good reputation for\nhonesty.\n\n\n\n\n2      The parties stipulated during trial that on March 25, 2004, Delgado pled no contest\nto misdemeanor domestic violence (Pen. Code, § 273.5) and endangering a child (id.,\n§ 273) based on this incident.\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       3. Other Witnesses\n       Lisa Alford was a social worker for the Department. When she interviewed A., A.\ndid not say she had been molested. When she interviewed L., L. said Delgado cursed at\nher, made her do the dishes and called her stupid. L. said she reported the molestation to\nan afterschool program teacher, Jacqueline Ramirez. Teachers are required by law to\nreport child molestation. Alford could find no such report by Ramirez.\n       Ramirez testified that L. was one of her former students. L. never told her about\nany molestation.\n       Dr. Melanie Blumenthal was L.’s doctor from February to August 2010. L. never\ntold the doctor about any molestation.\n       Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Raymond Ybarra spoke to L. on August 4,\n2010 at the Department office. L. denied that Delgado ever hit her. She said he spanked\nher when she misbehaved.\n       Marianna Yamamoto, a dependency investigator for the Department, spoke to L.\non August 11, 2010. L. was tearful and anxious. She said she wanted to live with Leslie,\nnot with Delgado. L. told Yamamoto that Delgado had fondled her once, on top of her\nclothing. Yamamoto also spoke to S., who said Delgado had touched her “private area”\nwhile she slept between him and Leslie.\n       San Bernardino County Deputy Sheriff Randy Rouse interviewed S. on August 25,\n2010. S. said that Delgado touched her between 5 and 10 times; she was not certain how\nmany. They occurred at home, in Delgado’s van, and when she was in bed with Delgado\nand Leslie.\n       Buena Park Police Detective Christopher Nyhus spoke to Leslie on July 21, 2010.\nIn the course of a search, he found a glass pipe used to smoke methamphetamine. Leslie\nsaid the pipe did not belong to her. She said she had smoked methamphetamine in the\npast but had quit and had not used it in about a month.\n       4. Expert Testimony\n       Dr. Ronald Markman, a psychiatrist, evaluated Delgado to determine whether he\nhad a psychiatric condition that made him a potential danger to society, and whether he\n\n                                            10\n\fhad a predilection for sexual misconduct with children. It was Markman’s opinion\nDelgado did not suffer from a major axis one psychiatric condition, which would include\nschizophrenia, bipolar disorder, manic depressive disease, or anxiety disorders. Based on\nthe testing done, Markham found “there is not enough data to firmly conclude that there\nwas or there was not sexual misconduct.”\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\nA. Restriction of Delgado’s Impeachment of Leslie\n       Delgado and Leslie both had prior felony and misdemeanor convictions. Delgado\ncontends the trial court erroneously restricted his impeachment of Leslie to her prior\nfelony convictions, while allowing him to be impeached by both his prior felony and\nmisdemeanor convictions. He claims this disparate treatment violated his Sixth and\nFourteenth Amendment rights to confront witnesses against him, present a defense, and\nto a fair trial. As we discuss below, the trial court’s evidentiary rulings as to\nimpeachment were correct and did not violate Delgado’s constitutional rights.\n\n\n       1. Proceedings Below\n              a. Pretrial Proceedings\n       Prior to trial, the prosecutor raised the issue of Leslie’s impeachment with her\nprior convictions. First was a conviction of possession for sale of a controlled substance.\nThe trial court ruled the defense could elicit evidence “she was convicted of a crime\ninvolving moral turpitude. The point is . . . do not . . . indicate what the crime is.” The\ncourt made the same ruling for a 2000 conviction for possession for sale, 2010\nconvictions for possession of controlled substances and welfare fraud, and 2011\nconvictions for 14 counts of fraud and perjury.\n       The defense wanted to introduce evidence of Leslie’s July 21, 2010 arrest, and that\nafter she was released from jail, she “became aware of the investigation by the\n[Department] about her drug usage.” The trial court ruled that if Leslie was convicted,\n\n                                              11\n\fdefense counsel could refer to her conviction. Otherwise, the evidence was inadmissible.\nDefense counsel objected that the evidence was “a very big part of [the] defense.” The\ntrial court responded, “You can present it otherwise. Just—I’m not saying that you can’t\ncross-examine her about it. You can.” The same was true of evidence “Leslie . . . was\nordered to return to [the] probation office but didn’t appear” after her release.\n\n\n              b. Direct Examination of Leslie\n       During Leslie’s direct examination, while the prosecutor was questioning her as to\nwhy she returned to Delgado after the car-ramming incident, defense counsel requested a\nsidebar. Defense counsel stated, “Your honor, I thought that we’re going to talk about\nconvictions and not go into these cases at length. This particular case occurred in 2004.\nIt was a misdemeanor. I will admit the misdemeanor. I am objecting to the facts of the\ncase, otherwise I think this court’s going to hear a lot of witnesses on both sides and—\nhe’s charged with child molesting. I can see the relevancy [of] him being convicted in a\nmoral turpitude crime, but to go into every—if that’s the case—if the court wants me, I\ncan go into every fact of everything that she’s ever done.”\n       The trial court reiterated: “Look. We’re not going to have any testimony as to the\ncrimes that were committed either by Leslie . . . or by [Delgado].” Both could be\nimpeached with prior felony convictions involving moral turpitude. “But, on the other\nhand, you’re not to discuss or ask questions or elicit answers of what either Leslie . . . or\n[Delgado] were found guilty of.” The trial court stated that the ruling reflected a balance\nstruck by the court.\n       Defense counsel asked to have an Evidence Code section 402 hearing on the issue\nof Leslie’s felony convictions. The trial court stated that it had already held such a\nhearing but allowed defense counsel to make a record. Defense counsel explained that\nafter Leslie went to jail on June 30th, 2010, she learned of 14 felony charges against her\nfor welfare fraud, grand theft and perjury. Defense counsel believed he had “a right to\ndisclose these thefts and perjuries because” in pleading guilty, Leslie admitted she was a\nthief and a liar. The trial court stated that it had already ruled on the matter, and its ruling\n\n                                              12\n\fwas going to stand; defense counsel could not refer to the specific offenses. However,\nthe court would allow defense counsel to question Leslie regarding certain of her\nhandwritten notes, which he argued constituted admissions that she was a liar and a thief.\n\n\n              c. Cross-Examination of Leslie\n       During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Leslie if she was convicted of a\nmisdemeanor on July 21, 1997. The prosecutor’s objection was sustained. Defense\ncounsel attempted to ask Leslie about felony convictions, but the prosecutor’s objections\nwere sustained on the ground the information was to be provided to the jury by\nstipulation. In a conversation outside the presence of the jury, the trial court reiterated\nthat “we’re not going to talk about the misdemeanors.” Defense counsel protested that it\nwas a conviction of petty theft, which is a crime of moral turpitude. The trial court again\nstated that it was not going to allow impeachment with misdemeanors, only felonies.3\n       Defense counsel requested that he be allowed to impeach Leslie with convictions\nof possession for sale of a controlled substance. The prosecutor sought to exclude the\nconvictions because they were more than 10 years old, but the trial court stated that it\nwould allow the impeachment. Defense counsel also agreed to a stipulation that Leslie\nsustained three felony convictions prior to 2001. The court noted that “in addition to that,\n\n\n\n3       Delgado does not clearly distinguish here (and did not do so in the trial court)\nbetween impeachment by the fact of conviction versus the underlying misdemeanor\nconduct. The prosecutor was clear throughout that she intended to impeach by eliciting\ntestimony about the conduct underlying the misdemeanor convictions. The prosecutor\nrepeatedly referenced conduct and not convictions. The prosecutor began her cross-\nexamination of Delgado not by asking him about misdemeanor convictions, but instead\nwhether he had given a false name to law enforcement and used four other people’s\nsocial security numbers. In the trial court, Delgado’s counsel never distinguished\nbetween conduct and convictions and referred generally only to misdemeanors.\nDelgado’s counsel argued that the court did not permit him the same latitude as the\nprosecutor. The court, however, merely excluded evidence of the misdemeanor\nconviction and not the underlying conduct. The misdemeanor conviction the jury did\nlearn of was pursuant to the parties’ stipulation.\n\n\n                                              13\n\fthe parties have agreed that prior to 2002 that [Leslie] sustained three felony\nconvictions, . . . and that in 2007 [she] also sustained a felony conviction.”\n       Defense counsel later cross-examined Leslie about her arrest at the Orange County\nmotel, when L. was present with her. During a break in the proceedings, defense counsel\nstated that he was “laying a foundation for impeachment. . . . I’m not going into her\nconvictions.” He wanted to impeach her with evidence she lied to the police officer when\nshe said she was not currently using drugs. The trial court ruled that defense counsel\ncould question Leslie about the incident to determine whether she lied to the authorities,\nand he could mention the arrest insofar as it was necessary to provide background\ninformation. However the court would admonish the jury that “[a] mere arrest in this\ncase has no bearing on [Leslie’s] truthfulness.”4\n\n\n              d. Defense Case\n       Prior to presentation of the defense case, the prosecutor stated that when\nDelgado’s “character witnesses do testify, I intend to impeach them. Impeach them with\nstatements they’ve made. And also I’m permitted to go into misdemeanor conduct of\n[Delgado]. Not the fact of conviction, but misdemeanor conduct. I wanted to explicitly\nsay that that’s in the code.” Defense counsel objected that he had not “been able to do\n\n\n\n4       The court then instructed the jury: “An arrest in and of itself is not any evidence\nof misconduct or evidence that can be used to test the veracity, the truthfulness, of a\nwitness. Convictions that involve moral turpitude can be used as a consideration by you,\nif you wish to, for impeachment purposes. “Now, back to the time frame where—in\nsome time around June 30th, 2010, there is evidence that [Leslie and L.] . . . were living\nin the Red Roof Inn . . . and that she was arrested, she’s testified outside of the room.\nNow, the fact that she’s arrested cannot be considered by you at all. And if she’s charged\nand even convicted of a crime that doesn’t involve moral turpitude, you can’t consider\nthat for impeachment purposes either. However, if the testimony should be and may not\nbe—we haven’t heard it as yet—that she may have lied to a government official and then\nlater told another story, it can be considered along with all the circumstances under which\nit was told, of which you should consider whether or not under the circumstances it really\nmatters for impeachment purposes to you or it doesn’t.”\n\n\n                                             14\n\fthat on misdemeanors as to character of Leslie . . . . I’ve been told and informed that\nyou’re not talking about anything but felonies by this court.”\n       The trial court stated that it did not know what the prosecutor intended to prove,\nand reiterated that it would not allow impeachment with misdemeanor offenses. The\ncourt added that if the conduct “is far more prejudicial than it is probative I can always\nfall back on that and that’s my call.”\n       During presentation of the defense case, defense counsel told the court that before\nhe decided whether to call Delgado as a witness, he wanted to find out what information\nabout Delgado’s past the prosecution intended to cover. The prosecutor told the court\nthat she would be asking Delgado about the “underlying conduct of misdemeanors of\nmoral turpitude,” including assault, grand theft, violating a restraining order and giving\nfalse information to the police, “which are crimes of moral turpitude.”\n       Defense counsel protested that the trial court did not allow him to impeach Leslie\nwith misdemeanors involving moral turpitude but only with felonies. The trial court\nexplained, “This is different. This is the defendant testifying. And if the crimes are\ncrimes involving moral turpitude, whether misdemeanors or felonies, you’re able to\nmention the crime. We’re not going to go into any detail about the crime.” The court\nthen agreed with the prosecutor that she could ask about “the underlying circumstances of\nthe misdemeanor” if it involved Leslie or another witness, as long as the crime involved\nmoral turpitude. However, it would exercise its discretion to exclude such evidence if an\nincident “was so far back in time as in the court’s view not to be relevant.”\n       At the start of the prosecutor’s cross-examination of Delgado, she asked him\nwhether he “ever used any other name to law enforcement” and “ever used at least four\nother people’s social security numbers in your past.” Delgado responded that he had.\n       During redirect, outside of the presence of the jury, the prosecutor brought up the\nissue of Delgado’s no contest plea to misdemeanor committing corporal injury to a\nspouse. When defense counsel protested, the prosecutor responded that Delgado “lied on\nthe stand and denied that he even did anything, but yet he [pled] to it.” Despite defense\ncounsel’s reservations based upon the court’s limitations on Leslie’s impeachment,\n\n                                             15\n\fcounsel agreed to stipulate to a no contest plea to a domestic violence charge. Defense\ncounsel then stipulated in front of the jury “that the defendant [pled] no contest to\nmisdemeanor domestic violence, Penal Code section 273.5, corporal injury to spouse,\ncohabitant or child’s parent, and that he also [pled] no contest in the same information,\nsame case, to endangering a child, a violation of Penal Code section 273[, subdivisions]\n(a) [and] (b) . . . in 2004.”\n\n\n       2. Admission of Prior Felony Convictions for Impeachment Purposes\n       In general, “‘[t]he trial courts have broad discretion to admit or exclude prior\nconvictions for impeachment purposes . . . . The discretion is as broad as necessary to\ndeal with the great variety of factual situations in which the issue arises, and in most\ninstances the appellate courts will uphold its exercise whether the conviction is admitted\nor excluded.’ [Citation.]” (People v.

However, admission of a prior felony conviction for\nimpeachment purposes is subject to the trial court’s exercise of discretion under Evidence\nCode section 352.

This was permissible, and\nDelgado does not specifically challenge this ruling.\n       Moreover, both Leslie’s and Delgado’s prior felony convictions involving moral\nturpitude were admissible for impeachment purposes, and the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in ruling them admissible. (People v. Edwards, supra, 57 Cal.4th at p. 722.)\nWe also perceive no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s decision to sanitize Leslie’s\nand Delgado’s prior felony convictions. The court’s decision reflected the balance that it\nstruck. Because the jury was well aware that Leslie had numerous prior convictions\ninvolving moral turpitude, the procedure did not result in Leslie being clothed with a\nfalse aura of veracity. (People v.

(People v. Chavez, supra, 84 Cal.App.4th at p. 28; see People v.

She was\nimpeached with multiple prior felony convictions. In addition, the trial court allowed the\ndefense to cross-examine her regarding whether she lied to authorities around the time of\nher arrest in 2010, because that would reflect on her credibility. Thus, despite the ruling\nthat Leslie could not be impeached with prior misdemeanor convictions, the trial court\nallowed Delgado to examine her conduct which reflected on her veracity.\n       The trial court stated that it would allow the prosecutor to impeach Delgado with\nevidence of his conduct amounting to a misdemeanor, but the court indicated that it\nwould exercise its discretion to exclude such evidence if an incident “was so far back in\ntime as in the court’s view not to be relevant.” The prosecutor briefly questioned\nDelgado regarding his previous use of false names and social security numbers. She also\nasked him about his no contest plea to charges of misdemeanor domestic violence and\nendangering a child after he testified that he did not ram Leslie’s car in the 2004 incident.\nThe use of false names and social security numbers was relevant to the issue of\ncredibility. Evidence of his no contest plea was certainly relevant to the credibility of his\ntestimony regarding the 2004 incident.\n       We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s rulings regarding impeachment\nwith prior misdemeanor conduct. Both Leslie and Delgado were impeached with prior\nfelony convictions. The trial court allowed both to be impeached with prior conduct\n\n                                              18\n\fwhich reflected directly on their credibility on the witness stand. The trial court’s\nstatement that it was going to make a distinction as to Delgado’s testimony when it came\nto impeachment with prior misdemeanor conduct was a permissible exercise of\ndiscretion. (See People v. Leonard, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 497.) More\nimportantly, in restricting Leslie’s impeachment with prior misdemeanor conduct, the\ncourt did not allow Leslie to be given a false aura of veracity (People v. Chavez, supra,\n84 Cal.App.4th at p. 28), as it allowed cross-examination into her credibility.\n\n\n       4. Constitutional Claims\n       We reject Delgado’s claim that he was denied a fair trial by the court’s\n“segregating prosecution from defense and putting the thumb wholesale on the\nGovernment’s side of the scale.” As discussed above, the trial court’s rulings with\nrespect to impeachment of Leslie and Delgado were, for the most part, similar. To the\nextent the trial court ruled Delgado, but not Leslie, could be impeached with prior\nmisdemeanor conduct, no prejudice resulted, as Delgado was allowed to question Leslie\nregarding conduct which directly reflected on her credibility. The trial court did not\nunfairly tip the balance of the trial in favor of the prosecution.\n       Moreover, exclusion of evidence “of marginal impeachment value . . . does not\ncontravene a defendant’s constitutional rights to confrontation and cross-examination.”\n(People v. Brown (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585503\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585503/people-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 545; People v. Leonard, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 497-498.) “Given the ample evidence regarding [Leslie’s] credibility offered at\ntrial,” Delgado has not shown that allowing additional impeachment with misdemeanor\nconduct “‘“would have produced ‘a significantly different impression of [the witness’s]\ncredibility’”’ as required to state a constitutional violation. [Citation.]” (Leonard, supra,\nat p. 498.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fB. Exclusion of Leslie’s Prior False Accusation of Rape\n       In arguing that he was prejudiced by the trial court’s rulings on impeachment,\nDelgado notes that the trial court excluded evidence that Leslie had previously “falsely\naccused [him] of rape.”\n       In a pretrial motion in limine for a ruling on the admissibility of various evidence,\nDelgado sought admission of evidence that on October 10, 2006, “Leslie made a false\naccusation that [he] raped her, after an investigation the district attorney rejected filing\nthe accusation on a lack of Leslie’s credibility.” It was the defense’s position that this\nwas evidence of a conspiracy between Leslie and the children to falsely accuse Delgado\nof sexual offenses. Defense counsel further argued, “They investigated it. They found\nthat it had no merit. . . . As a matter of fact, they couldn’t even get a hold of her. And\nwhen they did, she was with [Delgado] in court in Whittier. It was—it’s just an\nindication of what kind of person this [Leslie] is, and I think it’s very relevant . . . .” The\ntrial court reminded defense counsel to “[k]eep in mind what I said in chambers,” that\n“[s]he’s not on trial. He is on trial.”\n       It has been held that it is error to exclude evidence that the victim previously made\nfalse accusations of rape. (People v. Hayes (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1245; People v.\nBurrell-Hart (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 597-600.) Such false accusations are\n“‘relevant on the issue of the molest victim’s credibility.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Tidwell\n(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2265591\"><a href=\"/opinion/2265591/people-v-tidwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1457.) Leslie was not the victim here, however; her\ndaughters were. Thus, this case does not involve “the typical scenario of a one-on-one\nsexual assault, in which victim credibility is often determinative,” and exclusion of a\nprior false accusation of rape is more likely to be an abuse of discretion. (People v.\nMiranda (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1403</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1425-1426.)\n       Moreover, Leslie’s prior accusation of rape “would have no bearing on her\ncredibility unless it was also established that [the accusation was] false. [Citation.]”\n(People v. Tidwell, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at p. 1457.) Evidence Code “[s]ection 352\nprovides: ‘The court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is\nsubstantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue\n\n                                              20\n\fconsumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the\nissues, or of misleading the jury.’ ‘[A] trial court’s exercise of discretion under Evidence\nCode section 352 will not be reversed on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse.\n[Citations.] It is also established that “‘Evidence Code section 352 must bow to the due\nprocess right of a defendant to a fair trial and his right to present all relevant evidence of\nsignificant probative value to his defense.’” [Citations.] This does not mean that an\nunlimited inquiry may be made into collateral matters; the proffered evidence must have\nmore than “slight-relevancy” to the issues presented. [Citation.] . . . [Citation.] The\nproffered evidence must be of some competent, substantial and significant value.\n[Citations.]’ [Citation.] A trial court’s exercise of discretion under [Evidence Code]\nsection 352 ‘will not be disturbed except on a showing the trial court exercised its\ndiscretion in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner that resulted in a\nmanifest miscarriage of justice. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       “[The d]efendant’s problem in showing that the trial court abused its discretion in\nexcluding the evidence concerning the prior rape [accusation] is that it is not readily\napparent that [the prior accusation was] false.” (People v. Tidwell, supra, 163\nCal.App.4th at p. 1458.) All Delgado’s proffer of evidence showed was that “they”—\neither law enforcement or the prosecuting authorities—declined to prosecute him based\non the accusation. In light of the relationship between Leslie and Delgado, that could\nhave been based on Leslie’s subsequent change of heart and refusal to cooperate just as\neasily as it could have been based on the falsity of the accusation. Admission of the\nevidence “‘would in effect force the parties to present evidence concerning [a] long-past\nsexual incident[] which never reached the point of formal charges. Such a proceeding\nwould consume considerable time, and divert the attention of the jury from the case at\nhand.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) For this reason, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\nexcluding evidence of Leslie’s prior false accusation of rape. (Ibid.; see also People v.\nLeonard, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 497.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fC. Other Arguments Made by Appellant\n         Delgado also complains that the trial court’s ruling that his former wife, Lynette,\ncould be impeached with her prior convictions involving moral turpitude prevented him\nfrom calling her as a witness. As a result, Delgado was precluded from impeaching L.\nwith Lynette’s testimony that she never saw Delgado hit L.\n         First, that Lynette never saw Delgado hit L. does not prove that he never hit her.\nSecond, as Delgado acknowledges, the prosecution was entitled to impeach Lynette with\nprior convictions involving moral turpitude. (Cal. Const., art. I, § 28, subd. (f); People v.\nEdwards, supra, 57 Cal.4th at pp. 723-724.) It matters not that Delgado intended to ask\nLynette “a single question, and elicit a single answer.” We perceive no abuse of\ndiscretion in the trial court’s ruling as it applied to Lynette.\n         Delgado also argues that “[r]estriction of Leslie’s cross-examination was\nconstitutionally noxious because it enabled the Government to portray her as a dedicated\nand well-meaning mother, someone who, while struggling with domestic violence and\ndrug addiction, was nonetheless a loving parent, concerned foremost about the welfare of\nher children—someone who, above all else, was standing up and telling the truth for her\nkids.”\n         “‘A prosecutor may make “assurances regarding the apparent honesty or reliability\nof” a witness “based on the ‘facts of [the] record and the inferences reasonably drawn\ntherefrom.’” [Citation.]’” (People v. Redd (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2387024\"><a href=\"/opinion/2387024/people-v-redd/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 740.) Thus, the\nprosecutor could attempt to portray Leslie “as a dedicated and well-meaning mother,”\ndespite her admitted history of drug abuse and incarceration, multiple prior convictions,\nreturn to Delgado after claimed incidences of domestic violence, and obliviousness to the\neffect of Delgado’s molestation on her children.\n         By the same token, defense counsel was entitled to argue that Leslie forced her\nchildren to lie about Delgado, and asked the jury: “Now, your question certainly is who\nwould do this to this person here and to their children? . . . What kind of a person would\ndo that? Now you’re wondering why I got into all the felonies and taking dope and all\nthat. Because this is the person.” Defense counsel pointed out that Leslie lost custody of\n\n                                               22\n\fher two older children due to her drug use, she gave birth to L. while in jail, she obtained\nfalse identification for A. for a trip to Las Vegas, and sustained multiple convictions\nduring this time period.\n       The trial court’s restriction on Leslie’s impeachment did not clothe her with “‘“a\nfalse aura of veracity”’” (People v. Chavez, supra, 84 Cal.App.4th at p. 28) or preclude\nDelgado from impeaching her with her prior convictions and dishonest conduct. It was\nnot “constitutionally noxious.” (See People v.
