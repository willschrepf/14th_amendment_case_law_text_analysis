(Tri-County) governing the joint use of\n\neach other’s utility poles.   In three issues, Tri-County, the plaintiff in the\n\funderlying suit, challenges the visiting trial judge’s summary judgment for\n\nVerizon based on Verizon’s construction of the terms of the agreement and the\n\naward of attorney’s fees to Verizon. We reverse and render in part, reverse and\n\nremand in part, and affirm in part.\n\n                                I.      Background\n\n      Tri-County is an electric cooperative that has provided electricity in Parker\n\nCounty and other Texas counties for over seventy years. In December 1959, Tri-\n\nCounty entered into a “General Agreement Joint Use of Wood Poles” with\n\nSouthwestern States Telephone Company of Brownwood, Texas for the “joint\n\nuse of their respective poles, erected or to be erected within the areas in which\n\nboth parties render service.” The agreement set forth an initial annual rental rate\n\nto be paid for the use of the joint poles and also provided for periodic adjustment\n\nof the rental rates at five-year intervals upon the request of either party. Tri-\n\nCounty executed four amendments to this agreement; in three of the\n\namendments, the amount of the rentals was increased.              The last rental\n\nadjustment occurred in 1993.          Verizon, which provides telecommunications\n\nservices in the same geographic area as Tri-County provides electricity, is the\n\nsuccessor to Southwestern States through a series of mergers and corporate\n\ntransactions.\n\n      In 1975, Tri-County entered into the same type of agreement with\n\nContinental Telephone Company of Texas. That agreement also provided for the\n\nperiodic adjustment of rentals. In 1981, Tri-County and Continental agreed to an\n\n\n                                           2\n\famendment of the contract that increased the pole rental rates; no further rental\n\nadjustment or other amendment to that agreement has been made. Verizon is\n\nalso the successor to Continental.            Both agreements, as amended, are\n\ncollectively referred to herein as the JUA.\n\n      In a November 6, 2003 letter to Verizon, Tri-County requested a rental rate\n\nadjustment “pursuant to Article XII,” stating that “[t]he new rates will be effective\n\nJanuary 1, 2004.” The letter concludes as follows:\n\n             Appendix B of the agreements provides a method (Share The\n      Savings Method) to determine rental rates based upon pole costs\n      and operational costs. Please coordinate evaluation of these costs\n      with Ed Sheppard of RASR Associates. RASR Associates has been\n      retained by Tri-County . . . to assist in developing joint use rental\n      rates. . . . We will need Verizon’s costs for 30 foot poles and\n      Verizon’s annual charge percentage relating to poles to make this\n      calculation.\n\nVerizon did not respond to the request for cost information, but Tri-County\n\ncontinued to bill, and Verizon continued to pay, rental at the 1981 and 1993\n\namended rates. In January 2005, Tri-County notified Verizon by letter that it was\n\nterminating the JUA under article XX effective February 2, 2008. In that letter,\n\nTri-County demanded that Verizon remove its attachments from Tri-County poles\n\nby the termination date and also asserted, “Verizon has not cooperated in\n\nproviding cost information as requested by letter dated November 6, 2003.\n\nBased on information filed by Verizon with the FCC and Tri-County Electric costs,\n\nthe rental rate will be $31.17/pole for the remaining three (3) years of the\n\nAgreement.” According to Tri-County, the $31.17 rate was a clerical error, and it\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\ftold Verizon later that the rate should be $29.21 instead. Beginning in 2009, Tri-\n\nCounty began billing Verizon at the $29.21 per pole rate because Verizon’s\n\nattachments remained on Tri-County’s poles and were being used by Verizon;\n\nVerizon has not paid pole rental since the termination date. 1\n\n      In late 2009 or early 2010, Tri-County realized that Verizon had not been\n\nseeking permits for new attachments to Tri-County’s poles for some time; thus,\n\nTri-County engaged a third-party consultant to inventory its poles. According to\n\nTri-County, from 2004 to 2010 its records had shown that Verizon had 5,307\n\nattachments to Tri-County’s poles, but the inventory showed that Verizon had\n\napproximately 7,523 attachments to Tri-County’s poles.\n\n      In October 2010, Tri-County sued Verizon (1) for breach of contract for\n\nfailing to pay rental to Tri-County for its attachments to Tri-County’s poles for the\n\nyears 2008, 2009, and 2010 2 and (2) breach of contract, trespass, and trespass\n\nto try title for failing to remove its attachments from Tri-County’s poles after the\n\ntermination date of the JUA. Tri-County also sought a declaratory judgment that\n\nVerizon had breached the JUA, that Tri-County had properly terminated the JUA,\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        In late 2009, Verizon tendered payment to Tri-County of $11.80 per pole,\nbut Tri-County returned the check because it was not in full satisfaction of Tri-\nCounty’s rental demand. Tri-County also sought additional rental for 2005–2007,\nbut it has not challenged the summary judgment as to its claim for rental for\nthose years.\n      2\n       Per the JUA, the 2010 rental would not be billed until 2011.\n\n\n                                         4\n\fthat Verizon must remove its attachments from Tri-County’s poles, and that Tri-\n\nCounty is entitled to the 2008–2009 rental it was seeking.\n\n      Tri-County amended its petition twice; its second amended petition\n\nexpanded its breach of contract allegations to include Verizon’s alleged failure to\n\nobtain Tri-County’s prior permission when making additional attachments to\n\npoles and sought breach of contract damages and declaratory relief for unpaid\n\nrentals from 2005 “to the present.” 3 Additionally, Tri-County also sought to enjoin\n\nVerizon from adding future attachments to its poles.\n\n      Verizon filed a motion for summary judgment on all of Tri-County’s claims,\n\nand Tri-County filed a motion for partial summary judgment. At a hearing on the\n\nmotions in November 2013, the visiting trial judge verbally granted Verizon’s\n\nsummary judgment motion. When the judge indicated that he would consider\n\ngranting Verizon attorney’s fees, Tri-County’s counsel argued that Verizon had\n\nnot pled for attorney’s fees in its answer even though it had requested attorney’s\n\nfees in its motion for summary judgment. Verizon filed a motion for leave to\n\namend its answer to include a request for attorney’s fees and to amend its\n\nmotion for summary judgment to present evidence of reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney’s fees. The trial court granted Verizon’s motion for leave to amend both\n\npleadings.   Additionally, the trial court signed an order denying Tri-County’s\n\n      3\n        Although Tri-County originally premised its breach of contract claim on\nVerizon’s alleged failure to pay the rental rate Tri-County had demanded in its\nNovember 2003 letter, its second amended petition alleged that Verizon had\nfailed to pay “an appropriate rental rate.”\n\n\n                                         5\n\fmotion for partial summary judgment, and a final, take-nothing judgment for\n\nVerizon, awarding it $1,100,000 in attorney’s fees for proceedings in the trial\n\ncourt and $150,000 in attorney’s fees in the event of an unsuccessful appeal by\n\nTri-County.\n\n                             II.    Issues on Appeal\n\n      In its first issue, with four subissues, Tri-County challenges the trial court’s\n\ngranting the summary judgment for Verizon and denying the partial summary\n\njudgment motion filed by Tri-County. In its subissues, Tri-County contends as\n\nfollows: (1) it validly terminated the JUA, which required Verizon to remove all its\n\nattachments to Tri-County’s poles as of the termination date, (2) there is at least\n\na fact issue as to whether Verizon is a holdover tenant, (3) Verizon has breached\n\nthe JUA because it (a) has not paid rental since the termination date although it\n\nmaintains and continues to use attachments on Tri-County’s poles, (b) at least a\n\nfact issue exists as to Verizon’s failure to report new attachments to Tri-County’s\n\npoles, (c) Verizon failed to provide cost and charge information in good faith in\n\nresponse to Tri-County’s 2003 request, and (4) there is some evidence to\n\nsupport an award of exemplary damages.            In its second issue, Tri-County\n\ncontends that the trial court abused its discretion by granting Verizon leave to\n\namend its pleadings to include a request for an award of attorney’s fees and that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion by overruling Tri-County’s objections to\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fVerizon’s summary judgment evidence of fees. 4 Finally, in its third issue, Tri-\n\nCounty contends that if this court reverses the take-nothing summary judgment, it\n\nmust also reverse the award of attorney’s fees to Verizon and the take-nothing\n\nsummary judgment on attorney’s fees sought by Tri-County.\n\n               III.   Propriety of Summary Judgment Rulings\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      We review a summary judgment de novo. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Joachim,\n\n315 S.W.3d 860, 862 (Tex. 2010). We consider the evidence presented in the\n\nlight most favorable to the nonmovant, crediting evidence favorable to the\n\nnonmovant if reasonable jurors could, and disregarding evidence contrary to the\n\nnonmovant unless reasonable jurors could not. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp\n\nAdvisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009). We indulge every\n\nreasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the nonmovant’s favor. 20801,\n\nInc. v. Parker, 249 S.W.3d 392, 399 (Tex. 2008). A defendant who conclusively\n\nnegates at least one essential element of a cause of action is entitled to\n\nsummary judgment on that claim. Frost Nat’l Bank v. Fernandez, 315 S.W.3d\n\n494, 508 (Tex. 2010); see Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(b), (c).\n\n      Generally, when both parties move for summary judgment and the trial\n\ncourt grants one motion and denies the other, the reviewing court should review\n\n      4\n       Tri-County has not challenged whether the attorney’s fees were\nreasonable and necessary, equitable and just, properly segregated, or whether\nthe Arthur Andersen elements were satisfied. Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry\nEquip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997) (op. on reh’g).\n\n\n                                        7\n\fboth parties’ summary judgment evidence, determine all questions presented,\n\nand render the judgment that the trial court should have rendered.           Mann\n\nFrankfort, 289 S.W.3d at 848; see Myrad Props., Inc. v. Lasalle Bank Nat’l Ass’n,\n\n300 S.W.3d 746, 753 (Tex. 2009). But because Tri-County moved only for a\n\npartial summary judgment, we may render only as to those matters that Tri-\n\nCounty raised in common with Verizon. See CU Lloyd’s of Tex. v. Feldman, 977\n\nS.W.2d 568, 569 (Tex. 1998); Bowman v. Lumberton ISD, 801 S.W.2d 883, 889\n\n(Tex. 1990) (op. on reh’g).\n\nB.    Allegations in Second Amended Petition\n\n      Tri-County alleged that after it terminated the JUA, Verizon failed to\n\nremove its attachments from Tri-County’s poles; Tri-County contends this failure\n\nto remove constituted a wrongful holdover.         Tri-County also alleged that in\n\ninvestigating the conflict, it discovered that Verizon had placed additional\n\nattachments on the poles without prior permission as required by the JUA.\n\nAccording to Tri-County, this discovery prompted it to engage an outside\n\ncontractor to inventory all of the attachments on its poles.\n\n      Consequently, Tri-County alleged that Verizon had breached the JUA by\n\nfailing to provide correct information regarding the extent of its attachments to\n\nTri-County’s poles, as required to calculate the applicable rental rate, and by\n\nadding additional attachments to its poles without prior permission. Tri-County\n\nalso sought unpaid rental from 2005 through the date of judgment, a declaratory\n\njudgment defining the rights, powers, and privileges of Verizon “with regard to the\n\n\n                                          8\n\fuse of [Tri-County] facilities, and specifically . . . an order directing Verizon to\n\nremove its attachments and to cease and desist from further use of any poles”\n\nbelonging to Tri-County. Tri-County further sought to recover the cost of the\n\ninventory.   Alternatively, Tri-County sought damages and injunctive relief for\n\ntrespass and trespass to try title.     Finally, Tri-County sought an award of\n\nexemplary damages and attorney’s fees under section 37.009 and chapter 38 of\n\nthe civil practice and remedies code.\n\nC.    Verizon’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n      Verizon alleged, “In this case, the parties disagree over the frequency and\n\nmanner in which the price and quantity terms may be adjusted under their JUA[].”\n\nVerizon argued that (1) it had not breached the JUA because the JUA “clearly\n\nand unambiguously require[s] payment of only rentals that are ‘agreed upon,’”\n\n(2) Tri-County “cannot prove its trespass claims (Counts 2–3) because\n\nVerizon . . . has the right to remain on [Tri-County’s] poles under the JUA and\n\nTexas law,” (3) Tri-County “cannot show that the pole inventory was caused by\n\nallegedly ‘wrongful acts’ (Count 1) that were only discovered because of the\n\ninventory,” and (4) because Tri-County cannot prevail on Counts 1–3, it also\n\ncannot recover attorney’s fees, exemplary damages, and declaratory judgment\n\nrelief in that, as pleaded, they are all dependent on its prevailing on Counts 1–3.\n\n      Verizon also contended that Tri-County could not recover for breach of\n\ncontract because it could not show that it had complied with the JUA in that its\n\nattempt to impose new rentals was directly contrary to the plain language of the\n\n\n                                         9\n\fJUA requiring the “mutual agreement of the parties” and that Tri-County’s\n\ndemands for increased rentals beginning in 2003 violated the JUA’s provision\n\nprohibiting “rates from being adjusted more frequently than every five years.”\n\n      Citing articles XI(a), XII, and Appendix B of the JUA, Verizon argued that\n\nthe plain language of the JUA unambiguously provides that any new rentals must\n\nbe “agreed upon” before they can be put in “the annual bill next rendered.”\n\nPeriodic increases are to be based on “joint review and adjustment” by\n\nagreement. According to Verizon, “[t]his plain language unambiguously requires\n\nagreement before rentals can be increased through either rate or pole count\n\nincreases.”\n\n      Regarding Tri-County’s trespass claim, Verizon argued that Article XX of\n\nthe JUA regarding termination and Article XIII, the default provision which is\n\nreferenced in Article XX, are silent about the removal of attachments from Tri-\n\nCounty’s poles; therefore, removal is not required upon termination. Verizon also\n\nargued that the JUA allows it to maintain existing attachments even after\n\ntermination and that Tri-County had irrevocably elected to “treat [it] as a tenant,\n\nrather than a trespasser” by demanding rent, engaging in negotiations for a new\n\nJUA, suing for past due rent under the JUA, and by alleging in its petition that\n\nVerizon was a holdover tenant. Verizon contended that the termination provision\n\nin Article XX applies only to the future granting of additional joint use and that,\n\ntherefore, all attachments made prior to termination are attachments existing on\n\nthe date of termination.\n\n\n                                        10\n\f      Regarding the inventory, Verizon alleged factually that it had no notice or\n\nparticipation in the inventory process, that the inventory counted “poles to which\n\nVerizon . . . is not actually attached,” that it counted “some poles twice,” and that\n\nit assumed “ownership of all poles as [Tri-County] poles ‘unless obvious in the\n\nfield.’” It also contended Tri-County had not alleged any breach of the JUA that\n\nwas a but-for cause of the inventory, that the JUA did not require Verizon to pay\n\nfor such an inventory, and that there is no evidence that Verizon engaged in any\n\nwrongful acts necessitating the inventory (i.e., breach of contract). According to\n\nVerizon, “If the only evidence of the alleged wrongful acts is the results of the\n\ninventory, the inventory cannot, by definition, be the natural, probable, or\n\nforeseeable consequence of those allegedly wrongful acts.”\n\n      Finally, Verizon alleged that Tri-County’s pleaded relief for a declaratory\n\njudgment, exemplary damages, and attorney’s fees all fail because they are\n\ndependent on Tri-County’s recovering under the breach of contract or trespass\n\ncauses of action. It also contended that Tri-County had produced no evidence of\n\nfraud, malice, or gross negligence sufficient to raise a fact issue on its entitlement\n\nto exemplary damages. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 41.003(a)\n\n(West 2015).\n\n      1. Tri-County’s Response\n\n      In its response, Tri-County argued that the plain language of the JUA\n\nprovides that rental rates are to be determined according to the formula set forth\n\nin Appendix B, the primary objective of which is an equitable sharing of costs.\n\n\n                                         11\n\fAdditionally, Tri-County contended that Article IV of the JUA requires Verizon to\n\nrequest permission before adding new attachments and that Article XX gave it an\n\nunconditional right to terminate the JUA upon three years’ notice after the\n\nexpiration of twenty-five years from the JUA’s effective date. It further argued\n\nthat it can recover damages for paying for the pole inventory because it would\n\nnot have needed to do so absent Verizon’s breaches in (1) failing to get written\n\npermission to attach additional attachments and (2) failing to pay rent for those\n\nattachments as required by the JUA.\n\n      Tri-County also responded that the motion as to its trespass claim is\n\npremature because it pled trespass as an alternative to breach of contract and\n\nbecause genuine issues of material fact exist. As part of this argument, Tri-\n\nCounty argued that Verizon is not entitled to keep its attachments on Tri-County’s\n\npoles in perpetuity because Texas law disfavors perpetual leases.\n\n      2. Verizon’s Reply\n\n      Verizon responded that there is no evidence that it refused to negotiate\n\nregarding rentals, that the evidence shows that it did negotiate and that\n\nagreements were made in past years, and that Tri-County is the one refusing to\n\ncooperate. Verizon also disputed Tri-County’s argument that the “not less than 5\n\nyears” provision does not apply post-termination of the JUA because (1) it is not\n\na holdover tenant and (2) that argument contradicts Tri-County’s own argument\n\nthat the JUA applies during a holdover.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fD.   Tri-County’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Verizon’s\nResponse\n\n      Tri-County reiterated the arguments from its response to Verizon’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment: (1) that its notice of termination effectively terminated the\n\nJUA, (2) that it had the right to require Verizon to remove its attachments from\n\nTri-County’s poles as of February 1, 2008, and (3) that Verizon is a holdover\n\ntenant.   Tri-County also reiterated its argument that Appendix B to the JUA\n\ngoverns the calculation of rent. In its response, Verizon re-urged the arguments\n\nfrom its motion for summary judgment and also claimed that Tri-County’s\n\n“counter-textual” interpretation of Appendix B would allow Tri-County to\n\nunilaterally impose a rental rate on Verizon.\n\nE.    Principles of Contract Construction\n\n      Our primary concern when construing a contract is to ascertain the true\n\nintent of the parties as expressed in the contract. NP Anderson Cotton Exch.,\n\nL.P. v. Potter, 230 S.W.3d 457, 463 (Tex. App.––Fort Worth 2007, no pet.). To\n\ndo so, we must examine and consider the entire contract in an effort to\n\nharmonize and give effect to all provisions so that none are rendered\n\nmeaningless. Id.; see J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 229\n\n(Tex. 2003). We presume that the parties intended every clause to have some\n\neffect. FWT, Inc. v. Haskin Wallace Mason Prop. Mgmt., L.L.P., 301 S.W.3d\n\n787, 794 (Tex. App.––Fort Worth 2009, pet. denied) (op. on reh’g).

Relevant Provisions of JUA\n\n      Because we must construe the JUA in its entirety, and because all of the\n\nprovisions of the JUA must be examined to understand the underpinnings of the\n\nparties’ intent and purpose, we will excerpt the relevant provisions below.\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f         Article I, entitled “Scope of Agreement,” subsection (c) states, “It is the\n\nintention of the parties that adequate telephone service shall be made available\n\nto the widest practicable number of rural users in the above territory.”             In\n\nArticle III, the JUA sets forth specifications for the poles that are to be jointly used\n\nand states that such poles\n\n         shall at all times be in conformity with accepted modern methods\n         such as those suggested in Edison Electric Institute Publication No.\n         M12 and shall at all times conform to the requirements of the\n         National Electrical Safety Code, Fifth Edition . . . except where the\n         lawful requirements of public authorities may be more stringent.\n\n         Article IV sets forth a procedure requiring Verizon to request permission in\n\nwriting on a delineated, attached form before “mak[ing] use of [Tri-County’s]\n\npoles.” It further states, “Whenever either party desires to reserve space for its\n\nattachments on any pole owned by the other party, either as initial space or\n\nadditional space on such pole, it shall make written application therefor . . . [and]\n\nthe owner . . . shall have the right to reject the application.” [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe JUA also requires a party desiring to change “the character of its circuits on\n\njointly used poles” to give sixty days’ notice to the other party and also provides\n\nguidelines for resolving any dispute if the other party failed to timely approve the\n\nchange.\n\n         Article V(b) governs how the joint use of each party’s poles is to be\n\nestablished, including a provision providing guidance for the ownership of such\n\npoles:\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\f             (b) In any case where the parties hereto shall conclude\n      arrangements for the joint use of any new poles to be erected, and\n      the party proposing to construct the new poles facilities already owns\n      more than its proportionate share of joint poles, the parties shall take\n      into consideration the desirability of having the new pole facilities\n      owned by the party owning less than its proportionate share of joint\n      poles so as to work towards such a division of ownership of the joint\n      poles that neither party shall be obligated to pay to the other any\n      rentals because of their respective use of joint poles owned by the\n      other.\n\nThe JUA further provides formulas for the allocation of costs between the parties\n\nfor the construction of new poles, depending on which party’s usage\n\nrequirements necessitated new poles. The cost of maintenance of a joint-use\n\npole is allocated to the owner of that pole.\n\n      Article X provides a mechanism for either party to abandon a jointly used\n\npole by giving the other party sixty days’ prior notice; if at the end of that sixty-\n\nday period, the owner removes all of its attachments from the pole, the other\n\nparty may, if it still has attachments on the pole, keep those attachments in place\n\nand pay the abandoning party “the then value in place of the pole . . . but in no\n\ncase an amount less than the net salvage value of the pole.” Subsection (b)\n\nprovides: “The licensee may at any time abandon the use of a joint pole by\n\ngiving due notice thereof in writing to the owner and by removing therefrom any\n\nand all attachments it may have thereon.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f      Pole rental is calculated on January 1 of each year based on “the\n\nperpetual inventory of poles as reflected on the latest application and permit.” 5\n\nArticle XI, the rental paragraph, was amended in all of the JUA amendments\n\nexcept the 1998 amendment to the Southwestern States contract. The 1993\n\namendment to the Southwestern States contract stated as follows:\n\n      The rentals per pole due from either party as licensee to the other\n      party as owner shall be based on the equitable sharing of the\n      economics of joint use as provided for in Appendix B. Subject to the\n      provision of Article XII, $8.82 per annum shall be paid by [Tri-\n      County] for each jointly-used pole owned by [Verizon] and $7.25 per\n      annum shall be paid by [Verizon] for each jointly-used pole owned\n      by [Tri-County]. The smaller total sum shall be deducted from the\n      larger and [Tri-County] or [Verizon], as the case may be, shall pay to\n      the other the difference between such amounts. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe 1981 amendment to the Continental contract changed Article XI(d) to read\n\nas follows: “Subject to the provisions of Article XII, $9.37 per annum shall be\n\npaid by [Tri-County] for each jointly used pole owned by [Verizon], and $6.25 per\n\nannum shall be paid by [Verizon] for each jointly used pole owned by [Tri-\n\nCounty].”\n\n      Article XII, entitled “Periodical Adjustment of Rentals,” reads in its entirety:\n\n             (a)  At any time after 5 years from the date of this\n      Agreement and at intervals of not less than 5 years thereafter, the\n      rentals applicable under this Agreement shall be subject to joint\n      review and adjustment as provided for under Section (b) of this\n      Article upon the written request of either party. In case of\n      adjustment of rentals as herein provided, the new rentals agreed\n\n\n      5\n       Although the wording of this part of Article XI differs in the Continental\ncontract, it is substantively the same.\n\n\n                                         17\n\f      upon shall apply starting with the annual bill next rendered and\n      continuing until again adjusted.\n\n             (b)   All adjustments of rental shall be in accord with the\n      provisions of Appendix B, and any changes shall take into account\n      the cost factors originally involved in all joint use existing at that time\n      under this Agreement. [Emphasis added.]\n\n      Appendix B, referred to in, and attached to, both the Southwestern States\n\nand Continental contracts is set forth below:\n\n            This Appendix describes the basic principles and guides which\n      have been used under this Agreement in setting the rents specified\n      in Article XI and which are to be used in making periodical\n      adjustments of rentals as provided for in Article XII.\n\n             Under these principles the rentals are intended, in so far as it\n      is practicable, to result in a sharing of the economies realized by the\n      joint use of pole plant in proportion to the relative costs of separate\n      pole line construction.\n\n            The procedures outlined herein take into account the\n            following objectives:\n\n            1. An equitable division of savings regardless of the\n            number of jointly used poles owned by each party.\n\n            2. Rental rates applicable universally in the area\n            covered by the Agreement regardless of whether the\n            pole lines involved are initially constructed with joint use\n            in view or are existing lines modified for joint use.\n\n            3.    Appropriate allowance in the rental rates for\n            additional costs incurred by each party in supplying\n            ‘normal joint poles’, as defined in the Agreement, and\n            the costs of other items required in the joint use of poles\n            which would not be incurred in separate line\n            construction.\n\n            4. Rentals based on the costs of “typical miles” of\n            separate lines, of newly constructed joint lines and of\n            existing lines modified to make them suitable for joint\n\n\n                                          18\n\f         use. The ‘per mile’ values of rentals are then reduced\n         to ‘per pole’ values for purpose of simplifying tabulations\n         and to provide for the joint use of scattered poles.\n\n        The rentals are the dollar values resulting from the licensee\n paying to the owner, as annual rental, an amount representing the\n annual charge on a separate line for the licensee less the sum of\n (a) the annual charges on the additional costs incurred by the\n licensee in establishing joint use and (b), the licensee’s share of the\n total annual savings. This share is the ratio of the Licensee’s typical\n separate line costs to the sum of the typical separate line costs of\n each of the parties.\n\n         The annual rent payable can also be stated as follows:\n\n                         Annual charges                                 Total savings in\n                         saved by                  Licensee’s           an[n]ual\nLicensee’s               licensee                                       charges\nannual rent   (Equals)   through not      (Less)   appropriate   (Of)   realized\n                         having                    percentage           through\n                         to build a                                     joint use\n                         separate\n                         line\n\n        The cost in place of a line of poles is made up of a number of\n factors including such items as right-of-way solicitation, clearing,\n staking, direct labor and material costs of bare poles in place and\n pro rata shares of construction supervision and overhead. These\n costs, for a specific area, may differ considerably from\n corresponding costs in other parts of the country. These variations\n in pole line costs will, however, affect both power and telephone\n lines to about the same degree.\n\n        The parties to this contract will mutually agree on the average\n cost of a typical mile of 35 foot, class 6 poles in place in their\n common area. Below are tabulated appropriate rentals over a range\n of typical mile costs. From this tabulation, the parties shall use the\n rental payments associated with the value nearest to the agreed\n upon average cost.\n\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\f                               RENTAL PAYMENTS\n\n           WHERE THE        THE TELEPHONE                THE COOPERATIVE’S\n       MUTUALLY AGREED     COMPANY’S ANNUAL                ANNUAL RENTAL\n      UPON AVERAGE COST RENTAL PAYMENT PER               PAYMENT PER POLE\n            PER MILE         POLE TO THE                 TO THE TELEPHONE\n       OF 35 FOOT CLASS 6 COOPERATIVE WILL BE             COMPANY WILL BE\n        POLES IN PLACE\n         APPROXIMATES\n              $350.*[ 6]               $1.00                     $1.70\n               410.                     1.10                      1.80\n               470.                     1.20                      1.90\n               530.                     1.30                      2.00\n               590.                     1.40                      2.10\n               650.                     1.50                      2.20\n               710.                     1.60                      2.30\n               770.**                   1.70                      2.40\n\n      *Rentals associated with this amount are minimum and applicable\n      for all lower costs.\n\n      **If average costs are substantially higher than this value,\n      appropriate rentals should be determined by agreement.\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n      The default provision, Article XIII, provides that if either party defaults in its\n\nobligations for thirty days after written notice from the other party, the\n\nnondefaulting party can “suspend the rights of the party in default in so far as\n\nconcerns the granting of future joint use” and if after such a suspension, the\n\ndefaulting party remains in default for sixty days thereafter, the nondefaulting\n\nparty can terminate the JUA “as far as concerns the future granting of joint use.”\n\n      6\n        Although the table and the notes delineated by asterisks are included in\nAppendix B to the Southwestern States contract, the amounts and at least the\nfirst asterisk are crossed out in the Appendix B attached to the Continental\ncontract. Although the second asterisk is not crossed out in the Continental\ncontract, the number it is next to is crossed out.\n\n\n                                          20\n\fThe default provision further gives the nondefaulting party the option of fulfilling\n\nthe defaulting party’s obligation with the right of reimbursement from the\n\ndefaulting party for the expense.\n\n      Finally, Article XX of the JUA, entitled “Term of Agreement,” states,\n\n            Subject to the provisions of Article XIII, Defaults, herein, this\n      Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated at the end of 25\n      years from the date hereof or thereafter upon the giving of written\n      notice to the other party not less than three years prior to the date of\n      termination.\n\nG.    Analysis\n\n      1. JUA Contemplates Removal of Attachments Upon Termination\n\n      The initial issue we must resolve is whether Verizon is required to remove\n\nits existing attachments from Tri-County’s poles upon termination of the JUA\n\nunder Article XX; this is a basis for Tri-County’s breach of contract claim and its\n\nalternative trespass claims. Because the termination provision in Article XX does\n\nnot expressly state that all attachments to joint use poles must be removed upon\n\ntermination, the parties argued in the trial court and on appeal that Texas law\n\nregarding leases applies to govern the disposition of the attachments upon\n\ntermination. Tri-County cites cases holding that Texas law disfavors perpetual\n\nleases and the common law that a landlord has the right to receive the property\n\nback at the end of the term; Verizon cites law in support of its argument that the\n\nparties intended in the JUA to create a perpetual right to lease the poles.\n\nVerizon also argues that the JUA “plainly (1) limit[s] termination of the right to\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\foccupy utility poles to the ‘future granting of joint use’ and (2) require[s] that new\n\nrental rates be ‘agreed upon.’”\n\n          Before applying common law regarding the disposition of property at the\n\nend of a lease term, we must first determine whether the JUA itself contemplates\n\nthat each party’s attachments should be removed from the other’s poles upon the\n\nexercise of the termination provision in Article XX; in doing so, we must consider\n\nthe context of the entire JUA and its overriding purpose. See, e.g., NP Anderson\n\nCotton Exch., L.P., 230 S.W.3d at 463. That purpose is clearly stated in the JUA\n\nitself:    to provide “adequate telephone service . . . to the widest practicable\n\nnumber of rural users” (Article I) with as equitable of a division of poles as\n\npossible so as to come as close as possible to the net result that neither party\n\nwould have to pay rent to the other (Article V(b)). To that end, the JUA allocates\n\ncosts of pole maintenance, construction, and load (Articles IV, VII, and VIII).\n\n          Although Article XX does not expressly state that removal of attachments\n\nto a joint use pole is required upon termination of the JUA, another provision\n\ndoes contemplate when removal is required: Article X requires the removal of a\n\nnonowner’s attachments to a joint use pole in the event the nonowner decides it\n\nno longer wants to utilize the pole as a joint pole, which the owner may do at any\n\ntime:\n\n                 (a)   If the owner desires at any time to abandon any jointly\n          used pole, it shall give the licensee notice in writing to that effect at\n          least 60 days prior to the date on which it intends to abandon such\n          pole. If at the expiration of said period the owner shall have no\n          attachments on such pole but the licensee shall not have removed\n\n\n                                             22\n\f      all of the attachments therefrom, such pole shall thereupon become\n      the property of the licensee, and the licensee shall save harmless\n      the former owner of such pole from all obligation, liability, damages,\n      cost, expenses or charges incurred thereafter, and not arising out of\n      anything theretofore occurring, because of, or arising out of, the\n      presence or condition of such pole or of any attachments thereon;\n      and shall pay the owner the then value in place of the pole to the\n      licensee but in no case an amount less than the net salvage value of\n      the pole to the owner as provided in Appendix A attached hereto.\n      The former owner shall further evidence transfer of title to the pole\n      by means of a bill of sale. . . .\n\n            (b)    The licensee may at any time abandon the use of a joint\n      pole by giving due notice thereof in writing to the owner and by\n      removing therefrom any and all attachments it may have thereon.\n      The licensee shall in such case pay to the owner the full rental for\n      said pole for the then current year. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThis provision shows that the parties intended that nonowner attachments would\n\nbe allowed to remain only on owner-designated joint use poles for which rental is\n\npaid unless the nonowner desired to purchase the pole.\n\n      The considerable investment involved in providing such widespread\n\ntelephone service as possible, in addition to ensuring continuing access to\n\ntelephone service in more rural areas, are presumably two of the reasons for the\n\nrestriction of termination of the JUA until the expiration of at least twenty-five\n\nyears from its effective date. See, e.g., Pub. Util. Comm’n of Tex. v. Tex. Tel.\n\nAss’n, 163 S.W.3d 204, 207 (Tex. App.––Austin 2005, no pet.) (“One of the goals\n\nof the Federal Communications Commission (‘FCC’) is to ensure that all\n\nAmericans have access to affordable phone service.”). The plain language of\n\nthat provision, Article XX, imposes no restriction on the termination of the JUA\n\n\n\n\n                                       23\n\fafter the initial twenty-five year period other than that three years’ prior notice\n\nmust be given.\n\n      Verizon argues that the initial clause, “Subject to the provisions of Article\n\nXIII, Defaults, herein,” imposes the requirements of the default provision into the\n\ntermination provision; in other words, that the potential and logical consequences\n\nof a party’s termination of the JUA are “subject to” and thus limited by the\n\nremedies outlined in the default provision.       But Verizon has confused the\n\ntermination and default provisions in the JUA. In the context of the entire JUA,\n\nthis introductory clause must be construed to modify and provide an exception to\n\nthe part of the termination clause that sets a per se initial term of twenty-five\n\nyears. See Spiritas v. Rabinowitz, 544 S.W.2d 710, 718–19 (Tex. App.––Dallas\n\n1976, writ ref’d n.r.e.). For the default provision to provide such an exception, it\n\nmust be different in some way from the termination provision. Thus, referencing\n\nthe default provision, the construction that contextualizes the two most clearly, in\n\nfurtherance of the purpose of the JUA, is that the only exception to the twenty-\n\nfive year initial term––or subsequent three-year lead time of later termination––is\n\nthat a nondefaulting party can deny future attachments to joint poles in the event\n\nof a default within the initial twenty-five-year term.    Importantly, the default\n\nprovision does not suspend the defaulting party’s obligation to pay rental for\n\nthen-current attachments during an event of default.        Thus, to construe the\n\ntermination provision to allow each party to continue using the other’s poles rent-\n\nfree after the termination date would mean the termination provision would have\n\n\n                                        24\n\fno effect at all. Accordingly, we construe the termination provision to require that\n\neach party remove its attachments from the other’s joint use poles; to do so\n\notherwise would render the entire purpose of a termination provision\n\nmeaningless and would convert the JUA into a perpetual right governed only by\n\ncommon law, which is not contemplated by the remainder of the JUA. See Wood\n\nCare Ctrs., Inc. v. Evangel Temple Assembly of God of Wichita Falls, Tex., 307\n\nS.W.3d 816, 821 (Tex. App.––Fort Worth 2010, pet. denied) (resolving potential\n\nconflict of termination provisions in lease by interpreting one to provide an\n\nexception to the other); cf. Ethan’s Glen Cmty. Ass’n v. Kearney, 667 S.W.2d\n\n287, 291 (Tex. App.––Houston [1st Dist.] 1984, no writ) (holding that permission\n\nto extend patio fences to encompass common area of development was not\n\nirrevocable despite homeowners’ expenditures of money and labor because to\n\ndo so “would, in effect, create a perpetual easement across the plaintiff’s land”).\n\nThis result is not undercut by the appellate court’s reasoning in Philpot v. Fields,\n\nrelied on by Verizon. 633 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex. App.––Texarkana 1982, no\n\nwrit). The court in that case based its decision primarily on the intent of the\n\nparties as clearly expressed in the lease at issue, which is what we have done\n\nhere. See id.\n\n      Moreover, Article VI of the JUA makes it clear that the parties’ occupation\n\nof joint use poles is subject to the existing property rights of other landowners,\n\nand it expressly disavows any warranty of easement or right-of-way rights. To\n\nthe extent then that Verizon is using Tri-County’s poles pursuant to easement\n\n\n                                        25\n\frights granted to Tri-County by a landowner, Verizon’s use and occupation of the\n\npoles is subordinate to the duration and scope of those easements.

App.––Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied). Thus, this provision also\n\nweighs against a conclusion that the parties intended a perpetual lease of the\n\njoint use poles.\n\n      We conclude and hold that the trial court erred by denying Tri-County’s\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment to the extent it sought an order that (a) after\n\ntermination, Verizon became a holdover tenant 7 and that (b) Tri-County had the\n\nright to demand removal of Verizon’s attachments to its joint use poles as of the\n\ntermination date. 8\n\n      2. Trespass-Based Claims\n\n      Verizon argues that if termination of the JUA requires it to remove its\n\nattachments from the joint use poles, it is nevertheless entitled to summary\n\n\n      7\n      See Coinmach Corp. v. Aspenwood Apartment Corp., 417 S.W.3d 909,\n915–16 (Tex. 2013) (defining “[a] tenant who continues to occupy leased\npremises after expiration or termination of its lease [as] a ‘holdover tenant’”).\n      8\n        Verizon characterizes the requests in Tri-County’s motion for partial\nsummary judgment as pleadings seeking declaratory judgment relief; however,\nTri-County did not specifically seek the partial summary judgment under its\npleading for declaratory relief. Questions of law are appropriate matters for\nsummary judgment, including partial summary judgment. Rhone-Poulenc, Inc. v.\nSteel, 997 S.W.2d 217, 222 (Tex. 1999); see, e.g., Bassett v. Am. Nat’l Bank,\n145 S.W.3d 692, 695–97 (Tex. App.––Fort Worth 2004, no pet.).\n\n\n                                        26\n\fjudgment on Tri-County’s trespass claims because by demanding rental for the\n\nperiod after termination of the JUA, Tri-County elected to treat it as a tenant at\n\nwill, subject to the terms of the JUA, rather than as a trespasser. 9 See Coinmach\n\nCorp., 417 S.W.3d at 916.\n\n              a. Applicable Law\n\n      In Coinmach, the supreme court explained the law regarding the status of\n\na tenant who remains in possession of leased premises after the expiration of the\n\nlease term:\n\n             A tenant at will is a holdover tenant who “holds possession\n      with the landlord’s consent but without fixed terms (as to duration or\n      rent).” Because tenants at will remain in possession with their\n      landlords’ consent, their possession is lawful, but it is for no fixed\n      term, and the landlords can put them out of possession at any time.\n      By contrast, a tenant at sufferance is “[a] tenant who has been in\n      lawful possession of property and wrongfully remains as a holdover\n      after the tenant’s interest has expired.” The defining characteristic of\n      a tenancy at sufferance is the lack of the landlord’s consent to the\n      tenant’s continued possession of the premises. With the owner’s\n      consent, the holdover tenant becomes a tenant at will; without it, a\n      tenant at sufferance.\n\n            A lease agreement may provide that its terms continue to\n      apply to a holdover tenant. But if, as here, the lease does not\n      address the issue, and if the parties do not enter into a new lease\n\n      9\n        Verizon did not move for summary judgment on the opposite ground: that\ntreating it as a tenant-at-sufferance precluded a claim for breach of contract for\nthe failure to pay rent during the wrongful holdover. See Coinmach Corp., 417\nS.W.3d at 917. Verizon also alleges in footnote 7 of its brief that Tri-County\nvoluntarily dropped its holdover tenancy claim in the Second Amended Petition;\nhowever, Tri-County’s alternative breach of contract and trespass claims are not\nonly based on the allegation that Verizon owes Tri-County damages for\nremaining on its poles after the termination date, Tri-County uses the term\n“holdover tenant” in its allegations as to both theories of recovery.\n\n\n                                        27\n\f      agreement, the parties’ conduct will determine whether the holdover\n      tenant becomes a tenant at will or a tenant at sufferance. “Under\n      the common law holdover rule, a landlord may elect to treat a tenant\n      holding over as either a trespasser”––that is, a tenant at\n      sufferance—“or as a tenant holding under the terms of the original\n      lease”––that is, a tenant at will. Thus, an implied agreement to\n      create a new lease using the terms of the prior lease may arise if\n      both parties engage in conduct that manifests such intent. If the\n      tenant remains in possession and continues to pay rent, and the\n      landlord, having knowledge of the tenant’s possession, continues to\n      accept the rent without objection to the continued possession, the\n      tenant is a tenant at will, and the terms of the prior lease will\n      continue to govern the new arrangement absent an agreement to\n      the contrary. The mere fact that the tenant remains in possession,\n      however, is not sufficient to create a tenancy at will; unless the\n      parties’ conduct demonstrates the landlord’s consent to the\n      continued possession, the tenant is a tenant at sufferance.\n\nId. at 915–16 (citations omitted). The supreme court went on to hold that the\n\nparties’ conduct in that case––which had been tried to a jury––showed (1) that\n\nthe landlord did not consent to the holdover and thus elected to treat the tenant\n\nas a tenant at sufferance, (2) that no lease governed the conduct of the parties\n\nduring the holdover period, and, therefore, (3) that the landlord could only\n\nrecover damages attributable to the holdover period under its trespass theories\n\nrather than a breach of contract theory. See id. at 916–17, 922–23.\n\n      We must, therefore, determine if Verizon conclusively proved that Tri-\n\nCounty elected to treat it as a tenant at will or if a fact issue exists.\n\n             b. Evidence of Parties’ Post-termination Conduct\n\n      Tri-County’s 2005 termination letter indicated, “Termination will be effective\n\nat the close of business on February 1, 2008. According to Article XX, Verizon\n\nmust remove its facilities from Tri-County Electric poles by termination date.”\n\n\n                                           28\n\fThis appears to show that Tri-County initially did not consent to Verizon’s\n\nholdover tenancy.\n\n      But the summary judgment record also contains correspondence between\n\nTri-County and Verizon indicating that Tri-County and Verizon attempted to\n\nnegotiate either an amendment to the JUA or a new agreement after the\n\ntermination date. A May 16, 2007 email from David Moore with Tri-County to\n\nStuart Shiller with Verizon indicates that Tri-County was interested in negotiating\n\namendments to the JUA. Another email from Moore to Shiller dated June 29,\n\n2009, over a year after the termination date, stated, “I would like to meet . . . .\n\nWe need to start the process of negotiating a new amendment to the joint use\n\nagreement between Verizon and Tri-County Electric. I intend to have our outside\n\ncounsel, Rebecca Price, present at the meeting. You may also bring counsel.”\n\nAnother email dated September 25, 2009 acknowledged that Verizon had offered\n\nto “purchase poles to achieve a parity ratio of 45% [Verizon] and 55%” Tri-County\n\nand showed that the parties had exchanged draft documents. The email also\n\nstated, “During our last meeting, you indicated that you intended to review the\n\ntermination provisions of the current agreement and [Verizon’s] rights after\n\ntermination. Could you share with us the results of that review?” [Emphasis\n\nadded.] Finally, a third email dated October 27, 2009 stated:\n\n      I misspoke concerning the rental rate that Tri-County will accept for\n      2008. We have billed for the 2008 cont[r]acts in an invoice dated\n      February 2, 2009. I have attached a scanned copy of the invoice.\n      Tri-County . . . will only accept the full amount for the 2008\n      cont[r]acts. If we negotiate some other amount with a new\n\n\n                                        29\n\f      agreement, then any difference will be refunded or credited as\n      appropriate.\n\nThe record also contains copies of invoices from Tri-County to Verizon for pole\n\nrental due in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.\n\n      Tri-County’s counsel sent a demand letter to Verizon dated January 21,\n\n2010, which stated as follows:\n\n              Our firm represents Tri-County Electric Cooperative, Inc. in\n      connection with the attachments to its poles and specifically the\n      attachments of your company Verizon. I have your letter of\n      December 23, 2009 to Mr. David Moore of Tri-County. Enclosed you\n      will find your company’s check for annual pole attachment rental\n      which is not consistent with the invoice or the prior [JUA].\n\n            The invoice was billed in accordance with a calculation under\n      Appendix B to the now terminated [JUA]. That agreement was\n      terminated pursuant to notice given you dated January 20, 2005.\n      Pursuant to the agreement you had three years to remove your\n      attachments from Tri-County’s poles but did not do so. Your\n      continued occupancy of those poles makes you a holdover tenant,\n      holding over under the prior [JUA].\n\n             Your conclusion is that, because the agreement was\n      terminated, your occupancy on those poles is not governed by the\n      prior agreement and rate calculation. You are incorrect. As with any\n      holdover tenant, under the law, the prior agreement governs the time\n      you are holding over even though you may be and are a trespasser\n      on those poles.\n\n            In connection with the negotiation of a new rate, you have\n      proposed the FCC Telecom formula. You know of course that the\n      formula has no application to Tri-County. As an electric cooperative,\n      Tri-County is excluded from the FCC jurisdiction over pole\n      attachment rates as that is left to state regulation. As you also know,\n      Texas has not chosen to exercise jurisdiction or to regulate pole\n      attachment rates or contracts. Therefore, your entitlement to be on\n      the poles of Tri-County is purely a matter of negotiated contract and\n      presently, you have refused to pay as a holdover tenant under the\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\fprior agreement and also chosen not to remove your attachments\nfrom the poles.\n\n      ....\n\n        Tri-County Electric is willing to sit down with you and negotiate\na new pole attachment rental agreement which would include new\nrates. It is not, however, willing to apply the FCC Telecom formula\nor to accept a rate such as you propose in your December 23 letter.\nAs a good faith gesture, you should pay the rental rates billed you\npursuant to Appendix B for 2008 and 2009 and contact me to\narrange for a time to discuss and hopefully negotiate a new\nagreement. If you choose not to proceed in this manner I will have\nno choice but to recommend to my client that it pursue all\nappropriate remedies available to it, which may include commencing\nlitigation against Verizon for recovery of rental rates for the years\n2008 and 2009 based on the Appendix B formula as a holdover\ntenant, for costs and attorneys’ fees, and for an appropriate order\nwith respect to your continued occupancy of space on Tri-County’s\npoles.\n\n       It is Tri-County’s intent to negotiate in good faith a rental rate\nwhich adequately covers its costs resulting from your occupancy on\nits poles. [Emphasis added.]\n\nIn a subsequent letter dated August 24, 2010, Tri-County’s counsel wrote,\n\nUnfortunately, it appears that we are at an impasse in that we\ncannot agree with your positions as stated in your letter with regard\nto pole attachment rates that should apply to Verizon’s occupation of\nTri-County poles.\n\n       By this letter, please accept this as Tri-County’s directive that\nVerizon remove all attachments from our poles as soon as possible.\nFurther, we expect Verizon to pay the full amount owed for its\nattachments including not only pole attachment rates but also\nrelated fees in the present amount of $153,129.32 for 2008 and\n2009 for a total amount of $306,258.64. Please be advised that if\nVerizon does not begin to remove all attachments from Tri-County\npoles immediately and complete that process in a reasonable time,\nand pay all amounts due and owing as stated herein, Tri-County will\nbe left with little recourse but to pursue an action against Verizon in\ncourt to get a judgment directing Verizon’s removal from our poles\n\n\n                                   31\n\fand an award of damages for amounts owed which may include not\nonly the past due rental rates, fees and penalties but also attorneys’\nfees, pre- and post-judgment interest and other costs incurred.\n\nIn Moore’s affidavit attached as summary judgment evidence, he explains,\n\n       23. Despite numerous demands, Verizon continually refused\nto pay the $29.21 rental rate during the three years after the Notice\nof Termination. It was always our intention to hold Verizon to its\nobligation to pay the $29.21 rate between the time of the Notice of\nTermination, January 20, 2005, to the time by which Verizon was\nsupposed to remove its facilities, February 1, 2008. It was never our\nintent at [Tri-County] to accept the $7.25 per pole paid by Verizon as\nfull payment, or to waive our right to collect the full amount owed\nbetween January 2005 and January 2008 ($29.21 per pole) by\napplying Verizon’s payments at the $7.25 rate to their account. Our\nintent was to reflect a credit to their account for the amount paid.\n\n       24. On or about August 24, 2010, [Tri-County] sent another\ndemand that Verizon remove its attachments from its poles. To\ndate, Verizon has failed and refused to remove its attachments from\n[Tri-County’s] poles and continues to utilize its attachments to those\npoles for the delivery of its services. Verizon has also refused to pay\n[Tri-County] the rental rates that [it] has demanded for the use of\nsuch attachments from February 1, 2008 to the present. When\npayments for a lesser amount were received from Verizon during\nthis time period, [Tri-County] rejected all such payments on the\nadvice of its attorneys. At no time since February 1, 2008, has [Tri-\nCounty] agreed or otherwise consented to allow Verizon to remain\nattached to its poles.\n\n      25. Given Verizon’s refusal to remove its attachments from\n[Tri-County’s] poles, and its refusal to pay the $29.21 rate that had\nbeen demanded for the January 2005 to January 2008 time period,\n[Tri-County] again calculated the rental rate per pole that should be\npaid by Verizon to [Tri-County] for the time period of January 2008 to\nJanuary 2013 to be $37.04, $39.76, $40.95, $40.53, and $40.53\nrespectively. It was always our understanding at [Tri-County] that\nthe provisions of the Contract that implied that the parties had a right\nto request a rate adjustment no more than every five years applied\nonly once an appropriate rate calculated in accordance with\nAppendix B was being paid by the parties. That never occurred\n\n\n\n                                  32\n\f      between [Tri-County] and Verizon after [Tri-County] first requested\n      the rate adjustment in 2003. [Emphasis added.]\n\n            c. Fact Issue Exists\n\n      Verizon contends that Tri-County consented to its possession, thus\n\nprecluding a trespass claim, because Tri-County has not removed its\n\nattachments from Verizon’s poles, Tri-County has invoiced Verizon for rental\n\nafter the termination, Tri-County has negotiated with Verizon to enter into a new\n\nagreement with increased rates, and Tri-County has demanded rental under the\n\nterms of the JUA post-termination. There is at least a fact question as to whether\n\nTri-County maintains any attachments on Verizon poles; the record contains an\n\nexcerpt from Moore’s deposition in which he states that he is not sure but that he\n\nthinks that Tri-County may not have any attachments on Verizon’s poles. What\n\nthe record does show is that Tri-County told Verizon to remove its attachments\n\non the termination date in its termination notice; several months before the\n\ntermination date, Tri-County communicated to Verizon that it was interested in\n\namending the JUA; Tri-County billed Verizon for rental after the termination date\n\nat a different rate from the last amended rate in the JUA but purportedly in\n\naccordance with the formula set forth in Appendix B of the JUA; Verizon tendered\n\nrental for the year 2008 that Tri-County rejected; until August 2010, Tri-County’s\n\ncounsel’s position to Verizon was that its holdover was subject to the terms of the\n\nJUA but at the rental demanded by Tri-County; and as of August 24, 2010, Tri-\n\nCounty again demanded that Verizon remove all of its attachments.\n\n\n\n                                        33\n\f      We conclude and hold that the evidence raises a genuine issue of material\n\nfact as to whether Tri-County consented to Verizon’s holdover as a tenant at will\n\nunder the terms of the JUA. Tri-County made at least two demands that Verizon\n\nremove its attachments and it also rejected rental from Verizon. See ICM Mortg.\n\nCorp. v. Jacob, 902 S.W.2d 527, 533 (Tex. App.––El Paso 1994, writ denied)\n\n(holding that parties’ conduct did not show intention that holdover was tenancy at\n\nwill when new owner after foreclosure did not respond to inquiries by former\n\nlessee seeking to purchase property, refused to accept rent from her, told her to\n\n“sit tight” until it could obtain clear title to the property, and instituted forcible\n\ndetainer proceedings); see also, e.g., Wood v. Kennedy, 473 S.W.3d 329, 335\n\n(Tex. App.––Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (citing law that tenant at\n\nsufferance is liable for reasonable rental value of property during holdover). But\n\nTri-County also asserted, in its correspondence and second amended petition,\n\nthat all of the terms of the JUA applied to the holdover except for the rental\n\namount. In Street-Whittington Co. v. Sayres, cited by both parties, the trial court\n\nconcluded that whether the tenant’s holdover was a tenancy at will or tenancy at\n\nsufferance, based on evidence of the parties’ conduct, was a question that\n\nshould have been submitted to the jury. 172 S.W. 772, 776 (Tex. Civ. App.––\n\nAmarillo 1915, no writ). We believe the same reasoning applies here and that\n\nVerizon failed to prove conclusively as a matter of law that Tri-County elected to\n\ntreat it as a tenant at will rather than as a tenant at sufferance. In accordance\n\nwith the law as stated in Coinmach, whether Tri-County can recover damages\n\n\n                                         34\n\funder a breach of contract theory or trespass theory, then, depends on the\n\nresolution of this fact issue. Therefore, we conclude and hold that the trial court\n\nerred by granting summary judgment for Verizon on Tri-County’s alternatively\n\npled trespass-based claims.\n\n      Additionally, because we conclude that a fact issue exists, we also hold\n\nthat the trial court did not err by denying the remaining relief sought in Tri-\n\nCounty’s motion for a partial summary judgment except its request for a partial\n\nsummary judgment as to whether, as a matter of law, the JUA requires rental\n\nincreases to be determined in accordance with the formula set forth in\n\nAppendix B, which we discuss below.\n\n      3. Breach of Contract Claims\n\n      In its motion for summary judgment, Verizon asserted that Tri-County\n\ncannot maintain any of its breach of contract claims for unpaid rental because the\n\nJUA requires it to pay increased rentals only if they are “agreed upon” and that\n\nTri-County failed to comply with the JUA by demanding rental not required by the\n\nJUA and in violation of the provision that allows a rental increase only in five-year\n\nintervals. Tri-County argues that the parties agreed in the JUA to determine rent\n\nincreases according to the formula set forth in Appendix B. Although there is a\n\nfact question as to whether Tri-County elected to treat Verizon as a tenant at\n\nwill––and thus whether Tri-County can even recover in accordance with the\n\nJUA––we will address this issue because a resolution in Verizon’s favor would\n\npreclude Tri-County’s breach of contract action. See Mustang Pipeline Co. v.\n\n\n                                         35\n\fDriver Pipeline Co., 134 S.W.3d 195, 196 (Tex. 2004) (“It is a fundamental\n\nprinciple of contract law that when one party to a contract commits a material\n\nbreach of that contract, the other party is discharged or excused from further\n\nperformance.”).\n\n             a. Rental Calculation\n\n      Article XI(d) of the JUA, as amended, uses the generally mandatory term\n\n“shall” in providing that “[t]he rentals per pole due from either party as licensee to\n\nthe other party as owner shall be based on the equitable sharing of the\n\neconomics of joint use as provided for in Appendix B.” See Lesikar v. Moon, 237\n\nS.W.3d 361, 367 (Tex. App.––Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied). Nothing\n\nelse in the context of this provision or the remainder of the JUA indicates that the\n\nparties intended the word to be used permissively; thus, Appendix B and “the\n\nequitable sharing of the economics of joint use” must be the basis for determining\n\nrentals due under the JUA.\n\n      Additionally, the amendments all begin the rent provisions with the clause,\n\n“Subject to the provisions of Article XII.” Article XII provides for the “joint review\n\nand adjustment” of rentals at intervals of no less than five years. But that “joint\n\nreview and adjustment” is to be “as provided for under Section (b)” of Article XII,\n\nwhich states that “[a]ll adjustments of rental shall be in accord with the provisions\n\nof Appendix B, and any changes shall take into account the cost factors originally\n\ninvolved in all joint use existing at that time under” the JUA. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThus, both Article XI and Article XII use similar mandatory language. See id.\n\n\n                                         36\n\f      Appendix B reiterates that cost factors are to be considered and states that\n\nthe basic principles set forth therein “are to be used in making periodical\n\nadjustments of rentals as provided for in Article XII.”      [Emphasis added.]      It\n\nconcludes its formula tabulation guide with the statement that “the parties shall\n\nuse the rental payments associated with the value nearest to the agreed upon\n\naverage cost.” Thus, the language in Appendix B shows that there is more to the\n\ndetermination of rental than simply the agreement of the parties without any\n\nguiding factors; in negotiating an agreement as to rental, they are to employ the\n\nformula and “basic principles” listed in that Appendix. It is not difficult to imagine\n\nthe purpose for this:    just as the lengthy initial term would help the parties\n\nachieve more of a return on their infrastructure investment and further the\n\npurpose of facilitating the provision of services to more difficult and costly to\n\nserve and reach rural areas, a provision allowing the parties the flexibility to\n\nnegotiate rental based on an equitable formula would allow the parties to account\n\nfor changes in cost, market, and other factors that would affect their own\n\nexpenses while still working toward an equitable sharing of costs.\n\n      Verizon contends that language included with the asterisk in the table of\n\nAppendix B of the Southwestern States contract trumps all of the remaining\n\nlanguage in Appendix B. That language, appended to the last and highest rental\n\namount in the table, states that “[i]f average costs are substantially higher than\n\nthis value, appropriate rentals should be determined by agreement.”             Thus,\n\nVerizon contends that because all of the rental amounts listed in the JUA, as\n\n\n                                         37\n\famended––which were presumably tabulated according to the formula in\n\nAppendix B––are substantially lower than the current average costs as tabulated\n\naccording to the formula in Appendix B, this appended statement nullifies the\n\nformula in Appendix B altogether as to future periodic adjustment of rentals and\n\nthat such adjustments are only bound by what the parties can mutually agree to.\n\n      The table in Appendix B shows what the parties had agreed to be––in\n\naccordance with Appendix B––“the average cost of a typical mile of 35 foot, class\n\n6 poles in place in their common area . . . over a range of typical mile costs.”\n\nTherefore, the addition of the language next to the double asterisk at the end of\n\nthe table simply reflected that once the average cost of a typical mile of 35 foot,\n\nclass 6 poles in place in their common area exceeded the last agreed-upon\n\namount in the table, the parties would again have to agree on a new average\n\ncost per typical mile, taking into account the factors set forth in Appendix B, such\n\nas “right-of-way solicitation, clearing, staking, direct labor and material costs of\n\nbare poles in place and pro rata shares of construction supervision and\n\noverhead.” Because such a calculation involves numerous factors, and takes\n\ninto account costs incurred by both of the parties to the JUA––which presumably\n\nwould differ as to each of them as well as fluctuate over time, it makes sense that\n\nthe JUA would require “agreement” as to an average cost. But that does not\n\nmean, in the context of the JUA as a whole, that the “agreement” is not required\n\nto be based on the factors set forth in Appendix B. Cf. Fischer v. CTMI, L.L.C.,\n\nNo. 13-0977, 2016 WL 83477, at *7–9 (Tex. Jan. 8, 2016) (construing provision\n\n\n                                        38\n\fof contract that provided for future payment to be based on agreement as to\n\napplicable project completion percentages, holding that such a provision is not\n\ntoo indefinite to be enforceable, and observing that parties’ future agreement was\n\nto be based on the “method or standard for determining the payments” set forth\n\nin the contract); E & V Slack, Inc. v.

(describing, in context of class-certification\n\nappeal, lease arrangement between Shell and its service station lessors by which\n\nrental due would be calculated by a discounted formula depending on gas sales,\n\ntaking into account numerous factors that would vary depending on location and\n\ngas prices).\n\n      Verizon’s construction inevitably would lead to the instant dispute: Verizon\n\ncontends that Tri-County breached the JUA by demanding unreasonably high\n\nrental, and Tri-County contends that what Verizon is willing to agree to is not only\n\nunreasonably low but also under           market for similar industry-standard\n\nagreements.    To construe the rental provision as Verizon urges would be to\n\nobviate the need for Appendix B altogether, and to say that rental would only be\n\nincreased upon mutual agreement of the parties––with no guiding principles as to\n\nthe purpose or reasonableness of their negotiations––would be no different than\n\nrequiring the rental to be frozen for the entire term of the JUA, thus allowing\n\nVerizon to unilaterally block any proposed increases.\n\n      We conclude that Tri-County’s interpretation of the rental provisions in the\n\nJUA is correct:    the parties have the flexibility to negotiate and agree on\n\n\n                                        39\n\fincreased rental; however, their agreement must be based on calculations\n\nperformed in accordance with Appendix B and nearest to the agreed upon\n\naverage cost. 10     Verizon’s argument that Tri-County breached by demanding\n\nrental more often than every five years presumes that the JUA applies to the\n\nholdover term; 11 because we have determined that there is a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether the JUA applied to the holdover term, we likewise\n\nhold that a fact issue exists as to this ground of Verizon’s summary judgment\n\nmotion as well. 12\n\n      Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment\n\nfor Verizon on this part of Tri-County’s breach of contract claim. However, we\n\nalso conclude and hold that the trial court did not err by denying Tri-County’s\n\nmotion for a partial summary judgment order that “the Contract, including all\n\namendments, governs the relationship of the parties and that Appendix B of the\n\nContract governs the manner by which rents to be paid between the parties are\n\n      10\n        Verizon has cited a 2011 decision by an administrative law judge in\nArkansas holding to the contrary. Neither this court nor the trial court are bound\nby that decision. See Home Loan Corp. v. Tex. Am. Title Co., 191 S.W.3d 728,\n734 (Tex. App.––Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied) (op. on reh’g).\n      11\n          To the extent that Verizon contends that Tri-County violated Article XII by\ndemanding increased rentals in 2005, 2006, and 2007––before the termination of\nthe JUA––and that such a violation would preclude a post-termination breach of\ncontract claim, we conclude that there is at least a fact issue. Moore testified that\nthe initial rental demand of $31.17 was the result of a clerical error.\n      12\n        Because we hold that Verizon’s interpretation is not supported by the\nJUA, we need not address Tri-County’s argument that the language denoted by\nthe asterisk was amended out of the JUA altogether.\n\n\n                                         40\n\fto be determined” because it was not pled conditionally, i.e., in the event that Tri-\n\nCounty is found to have treated Verizon as a tenant at will rather than a tenant at\n\nsufferance, thus making the JUA applicable to the holdover tenancy.\n\n             b. Inventory\n\n      Verizon also moved for summary judgment on Tri-County’s claim that\n\nVerizon is responsible for the costs of the inventory because its breach of the\n\nJUA by underreporting pole attachments necessitated the inventory. According\n\nto Verizon, no provision of the JUA requires it to finance the inventory, and the\n\nundisputed facts show that it did not cause the need for the inventory.\n\n      Article IV requires a party to request permission from the other party in\n\nwriting before making any attachments to a joint use pole or before changing the\n\ncharacter of its circuits on a joint use pole. It also gives the owner the right to\n\nreject such an application. Moore’s affidavit indicates that Tri-County became\n\naware in late 2009 or early 2010 that Verizon had not been submitting requests\n\nfor pole attachments, which he thought was unusual based on his experience in\n\nthe industry. The subsequent inventory revealed substantially more attachments\n\nthan had been agreed upon by the parties in the JUA as amended.\n\n      Generally, the measure of damages for breach of a contract is that which\n\nrestores the injured party to the economic position he would have enjoyed if the\n\ncontract had been performed, which may include consequential damages. See\n\nAZZ Inc. v. Morgan, 462 S.W.3d 284, 289 (Tex. App.––Fort Worth 2015, no pet.);\n\nMood v. Kronos Prods., Inc., 245 S.W.3d 8, 12 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2007, pet.\n\n\n                                         41\n\fdenied). To be recoverable, consequential damages must be foreseeable and\n\ndirectly traceable to the wrongful act and result from it; thus, consequential\n\ndamages are generally not recoverable unless the parties contemplated at the\n\ntime they made the contract that such damages would be a probable result of the\n\nbreach. Stuart v. Bayless, 964 S.W.2d 920, 921 (Tex. 1998); AZZ Inc., 462\n\nS.W.3d at 289.\n\n      Tri-County has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the\n\nforeseeability of such damages. The JUA requires each party to notify the other\n\nbefore making new or additional attachments and before making changes to\n\ncircuit loading. Tri-County presented evidence that as of late 2009 or early 2010,\n\nTri-County became aware that, unusually, Verizon had not been submitting\n\nrequests for new attachments for “years.” Because the very nature of the JUA is\n\na sharing of costs in order to provide services and because rental is based on\n\npole count, such underreporting would naturally result in the need for some party\n\nto engage in a count of the poles. Whether the inventory that was performed is\n\naccurate or whether the consultant’s charges and scope were reasonable is not\n\nrelevant to whether the type of damage is foreseeable.\n\n      We conclude and hold that the trial court erred by granting summary\n\njudgment for Verizon on this ground.\n\n\n\n\n                                       42\n\f            c. Other Breach of Contract Claims\n\n      Verizon also moved for summary judgment on various theories on other\n\nparts of Tri-County’s breach of contract claims.\n\n      First, Verizon contended that it was entitled to summary judgment on Tri-\n\nCounty’s breach of contract claim for Verizon’s alleged failure “to provide\n\ninformation in accordance with the requirements of Appendix B.” Verizon argues\n\nthat Appendix B does not require the exchange of information, that if it does, Tri-\n\nCounty itself did not provide information to Verizon, and that Tri-County was not\n\ndamaged by the failure because it revoked the request after receiving public\n\nrecords with that information and because it did not use the information in making\n\nits new rate demand.\n\n      Although the JUA never expressly states that either party must provide\n\ncost information to the other, as we have stated, one of the overriding purposes\n\nof the JUA is the equitable sharing of costs; that purpose can be seen in the\n\nrental provisions as well as the provisions regarding the erection of new poles\n\nand the abandonment of poles.        While it is understandable that in today’s\n\ncompetitive market of telecommunications, companies negotiating contracts\n\naffecting the cost of providing services are not as willing to share information in\n\nsuch a way that it would affect their bargaining power, the purpose and spirit of\n\nthe JUA––which was entered into during a very different environment regarding\n\ntelecommunications––is that the parties will cooperate in the joint provision of\n\nservices in a way that comes as close as possible to equalizing their expenses\n\n\n                                        43\n\fso as to provide services to the maximum number of users possible. See Tex.\n\nBldg. Owners & Managers Ass’n v. Pub. Util. Comm’n of Tex., 110 S.W.3d 524,\n\n527–28    (Tex.    App.––Austin     2003,       pet.   denied)   (reciting   history   of\n\ntelecommunications regulation in Texas and federally, from geographic\n\nmonopolies to a competitive marketplace). Thus, even though the JUA does not\n\nexpressly state that the parties are required to share such information, one of its\n\noverriding purposes would be thwarted if they did not. See Aycock v. Vantage\n\nMgmt. Co., 554 S.W.2d 235, 237–38 (Tex. Civ. App.––Dallas 1977, writ ref’d\n\nn.r.e.) (“Since the lessor is obligated to propose a rate consistent with the factors\n\nenumerated, it must make that determination in good faith, and if it fails to act in\n\ngood faith or fails to propose any rate at all, as it did in the present case, it may\n\nbe deemed to have waived its right to propose the rate and thus to leave the\n\nmatter for the court’s determination.”).\n\n      With regard to Verizon’s waiver arguments, Tri-County points to evidence\n\nthat it did provide an example of its costs to Verizon with an invoice dated\n\nJanuary 24, 2012. That information is titled, “Tri-County – 2010 Appendix B\n\nCalculation – current w/ Initial Clearing and Adders.” Additionally, it points to\n\nMoore’s summary judgment affidavit, which states that although Tri-County\n\nobtained historical data from the FCC, its consultants later informed it that the\n\nrental calculation would be higher using the more current data. According to\n\nMoore, Tri-County nevertheless “made the decision to demand that Verizon pay\n\nonly” the rate based on the historical data “even though our consultants at RASR\n\n\n                                           44\n\fadvised us that we were in fact entitled to a higher rate for 2005-07 rental years,\n\nbecause it was the rate that we had demanded for those rental years from the\n\nbeginning.” Waiver is ordinarily a fact issue; the record shows that Tri-County\n\nattempted to negotiate new rental rates and a new JUA with Verizon even after\n\nthe termination date. See In re Lennar Homes of Tex. Sales & Mktg., Ltd.,\n\nNo. 02-15-00174-CV, 2015 WL 4366046, at *2 (Tex. App.––Fort Worth July 15,\n\n2015, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.). Thus, we conclude that the record shows at\n\nleast a fact issue as to whether Tri-County abandoned its request for the correct,\n\ncurrent information regarding Verizon’s pole costs. For the same reason, we\n\nhold that there is a fact issue as to the damages element of this claim.\n\n      Second, Verizon contends that Tri-County “has never identified a single\n\nattachment that Verizon . . . made to a [Tri-County] pole without permission\n\nfollowing termination,” which we construe to be a no-evidence ground. However,\n\nTri-County provided evidence that the total number of attachments found in the\n\nthird-party inventory well exceeds the total number of attachments agreed upon\n\nby the parties in the JUA as amended. We hold that––combined with Moore’s\n\naffidavit testimony that Verizon had gone for an unusual amount of time without\n\nseeking permission for new attachments under the JUA––this is enough to raise\n\na fact issue as to whether Verizon made new attachments to Tri-County’s joint\n\nuse poles without first seeking permission as set forth in the JUA. See Tex. R.\n\nCiv. P. 166a(i) & cmt.; Hamilton v. Wilson, 249 S.W.3d 425, 426 (Tex. 2008).\n\n\n\n\n                                        45\n\f      Finally, Verizon argues that Tri-County’s breach of contract claim based on\n\nVerizon’s failure to negotiate in good faith fails because Verizon “did negotiate\n\npursuant to the terms of the JUA[] and was not contractually required to provide\n\ninformation to [Tri-County] when doing so.” Verizon claims Tri-County was the\n\nparty who refused to negotiate in accordance with the JUA. Because we have\n\nalready concluded that at least a fact issue exists as to whether Verizon\n\nbreached the JUA by failing to give the requested information, we also hold that\n\nthere is a fact issue on this facet of the breach of contract claim.\n\n      For these reasons, we conclude and hold that the trial court erred by\n\ngranting Verizon summary judgment on Tri-County’s breach of contract claims.\n\n      4. Declaratory Judgment, Attorney’s Fees, and Exemplary Damages\n\n      Verizon moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims in Tri-\n\nCounty’s petition generally because they are dependent on Tri-County’s ability to\n\nrecover on the breach of contract or trespass claims, which Verizon contended\n\nall fail. Because we have held that the trial court erred by granting summary\n\njudgment for Verizon on those claims, we likewise conclude that the trial court\n\nerred by granting summary judgment on the remaining claims on the ground that\n\nthey are dependent on the breach of contract and trespass claims. Moreover,\n\nbecause the declaratory judgment claim must be remanded, Verizon is not\n\nentitled to summary judgment as to attorney’s fees based on its argument that\n\nTri-County cannot recover fees because they are not available in connection with\n\nthe breach of contract and trespass claims.\n\n\n                                         46\n\f      But Verizon did independently challenge the exemplary damages claim on\n\nthe ground that Tri-County “has not pointed to any evidence, let alone ‘clear and\n\nconvincing evidence’ that [its] trespass damages ‘resulted from fraud, malice, or\n\ngross negligence’ as required to obtain such damages” under civil practice and\n\nremedies code section 41.003(a). Tri-County relies on this court’s opinion in\n\nWilen v. Falkenstein to show that a trespass can be malicious and that it has\n\nalleged similar behavior by Verizon in intentionally occupying its poles without\n\npaying any rent and in refusing to negotiate a new rental amount in accordance\n\nwith Appendix B of the JUA. 191 S.W.3d 791, 800–01 (Tex. App.––Fort Worth\n\n2006, pet. denied) (citing law that “[e]xemplary damages are recoverable for the\n\ntort of trespass if the trespass was committed maliciously” and holding evidence\n\nsufficient to show that Wilen’s conduct showed a “specific intent to cause\n\nsubstantial injury to Falkenstein”).\n\n      Malice is defined in the exemplary damages context as “a specific intent by\n\nthe defendant to cause substantial injury or harm to the claimant.” Tex. Civ.\n\nPrac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 41.001(7) (West Supp. 2015). Specific intent means\n\nthat the actor desires to cause the consequences of his act or that he believes\n\nthe consequences are substantially certain to result from it. Reed Tool Co. v.\n\nCopelin, 689 S.W.2d 404, 406 (Tex. 1985). Malice may be proven by direct or\n\ncircumstantial evidence. Seber v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 350 S.W.3d 640, 654\n\n(Tex. App.––Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.).\n\n\n\n\n                                       47\n\f      Tri-County presented evidence that Verizon, unusually, did not seek\n\npermits to add new attachments to Tri-County’s joint use poles under the JUA for\n\n“years” before late 2009 or early 2010, that there was a significant discrepancy\n\nbetween the number of attachments counted in a 2010 third party inventory and\n\nthe last agreed-upon pole attachment count upon which rental was being\n\ninvoiced, and that Verizon has occupied Tri-County’s joint use poles after the\n\ntermination date without paying rental. This evidence could conceivably support\n\nan inference that Verizon intentionally stopped seeking permission for new\n\nattachments under the JUA to enhance its bargaining power in negotiating a new\n\nrental rate and, after termination of the JUA, that it held over for the same\n\npurpose.   However, the evidence also shows that (1) Tri-County’s actions\n\nregarding Verizon’s holdover were not consistent as to whether it was treating\n\nVerizon as a tenant at will subject to the JUA or as a trespasser, (2) that Verizon\n\ndisputed the applicability of the Appendix B formula, (3) that Verizon engaged in\n\nnegotiation discussions with Tri-County around the termination date, (4) that\n\nVerizon tendered payment that Tri-County rejected, and (5) that Verizon\n\nattachments may have been miscounted in the third party inventory.            See\n\nCoinmach, 417 S.W.3d at 922 (“[A] defendant will not be liable for exemplary\n\ndamages when the trespasser acted ‘in good faith,’ ‘without wrongful intention,’\n\nor ‘in the belief that he was exercising his rights.’”).   We conclude that Tri-\n\nCounty’s evidence is equally consistent with an inference that Verizon held over\n\nin good faith. See Soodeen v. Rychel, 802 S.W.2d 361, 363–64 (Tex. App.––\n\n\n                                        48\n\fHouston [1st Dist.] 1990, writ denied) (holding that plaintiff did not raise fact issue\n\nas to negligent entrustment because facts that plaintiff alleged contradicted\n\ndefendant’s affidavit statement that he did not entrust vehicle to alleged drivers\n\nwere equally consistent with inference that defendant did not entrust vehicle to\n\nthem). Under these facts, we conclude and hold that––should the fact issue\n\nregarding Tri-County’s election as to Verizon’s holdover tenancy be resolved in\n\nsuch a way that Tri-County’s trespass claim survives––Tri-County failed to bring\n\nforward evidence sufficient to raise a fact issue as to whether any such trespass\n\noccurred with malice as defined by section 41.001(7).          See Tex. R. Civ. P.\n\n166a(i); Hamilton, 249 S.W.3d at 426.\n\n         Accordingly, we conclude and hold that the trial court did not err by\n\ngranting summary judgment for Verizon on Tri-County’s exemplary damages\n\nclaim.\n\n         5. Disposition of First Issue\n\n         Having concluded that the trial court erred by granting Verizon’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment on all grounds except the ground complaining of Tri-County’s\n\nexemplary damages claim, and having determined that the trial court erred by\n\ndenying Tri-County’s partial summary judgment motion requesting an order that\n\n(a) after termination, Verizon became a holdover tenant and that (b) Tri-County\n\nhad the right to demand removal of Verizon’s attachments to its joint use poles\n\nas of the termination date, we sustain the majority of Tri-County’s first issue. We\n\noverrule the remainder of Tri-County’s first issue.\n\n\n                                          49\n\f                                IV.        Remaining Issues\n\n      We need not address Tri-County’s remaining issues because our\n\ndisposition of its first issue requires us to reverse the trial court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees to Verizon and remand that issue to the trial court along with the\n\nmerits. See Leake v. Campbell, 352 S.W.3d 180, 190 (Tex. App.––Fort Worth\n\n2011, no pet.).\n\n                                      V.     Conclusion\n\n      Having sustained Tri-County’s first issue in part, we reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment for Verizon except as to Tri-County’s exemplary damages claim only.\n\nWe affirm the trial court’s summary judgment for Verizon on Tri-County’s\n\nexemplary damages claim. We reverse the trial court’s denial of Tri-County’s\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment in part and render an order that (a) after\n\ntermination, Verizon became a holdover tenant and (b) Tri-County had the right\n\nto demand removal of Verizon’s attachments to its joint use poles as of the\n\ntermination date. We affirm the trial court’s denial of Tri-County’s motion for\n\npartial summary judgment in all other respects. Having reversed the majority of\n\nthe trial court’s judgment for Verizon, we remand the case for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                          /s/ Terrie Livingston\n                                                          TERRIE LIVINGSTON\n                                                          CHIEF JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: LIVINGSTON, C.J.; GARDNER and MEIER, JJ.\n\nDELIVERED: February 11, 2016\n\n                                               50\n\f",

(Tri-County) governing the joint use of\n\neach other’s utility poles.   In three issues, Tri-County, the plaintiff in the\n\funderlying suit, challenges the visiting trial judge’s summary judgment for\n\nVerizon based on Verizon’s construction of the terms of the agreement and the\n\naward of attorney’s fees to Verizon. We reverse and render in part, reverse and\n\nremand in part, and affirm in part.\n\n                                I.      Background\n\n      Tri-County is an electric cooperative that has provided electricity in Parker\n\nCounty and other Texas counties for over seventy years. In December 1959, Tri-\n\nCounty entered into a “General Agreement Joint Use of Wood Poles” with\n\nSouthwestern States Telephone Company of Brownwood, Texas for the “joint\n\nuse of their respective poles, erected or to be erected within the areas in which\n\nboth parties render service.” The agreement set forth an initial annual rental rate\n\nto be paid for the use of the joint poles and also provided for periodic adjustment\n\nof the rental rates at five-year intervals upon the request of either party. Tri-\n\nCounty executed four amendments to this agreement; in three of the\n\namendments, the amount of the rentals was increased.              The last rental\n\nadjustment occurred in 1993.          Verizon, which provides telecommunications\n\nservices in the same geographic area as Tri-County provides electricity, is the\n\nsuccessor to Southwestern States through a series of mergers and corporate\n\ntransactions.\n\n      In 1975, Tri-County entered into the same type of agreement with\n\nContinental Telephone Company of Texas. That agreement also provided for the\n\nperiodic adjustment of rentals. In 1981, Tri-County and Continental agreed to an\n\n\n                                           2\n\famendment of the contract that increased the pole rental rates; no further rental\n\nadjustment or other amendment to that agreement has been made. Verizon is\n\nalso the successor to Continental.            Both agreements, as amended, are\n\ncollectively referred to herein as the JUA.\n\n      In a November 6, 2003 letter to Verizon, Tri-County requested a rental rate\n\nadjustment “pursuant to Article XII,” stating that “[t]he new rates will be effective\n\nJanuary 1, 2004.” The letter concludes as follows:\n\n             Appendix B of the agreements provides a method (Share The\n      Savings Method) to determine rental rates based upon pole costs\n      and operational costs. Please coordinate evaluation of these costs\n      with Ed Sheppard of RASR Associates. RASR Associates has been\n      retained by Tri-County . . . to assist in developing joint use rental\n      rates. . . . We will need Verizon’s costs for 30 foot poles and\n      Verizon’s annual charge percentage relating to poles to make this\n      calculation.\n\nVerizon did not respond to the request for cost information, but Tri-County\n\ncontinued to bill, and Verizon continued to pay, rental at the 1981 and 1993\n\namended rates. In January 2005, Tri-County notified Verizon by letter that it was\n\nterminating the JUA under article XX effective February 2, 2008. In that letter,\n\nTri-County demanded that Verizon remove its attachments from Tri-County poles\n\nby the termination date and also asserted, “Verizon has not cooperated in\n\nproviding cost information as requested by letter dated November 6, 2003.\n\nBased on information filed by Verizon with the FCC and Tri-County Electric costs,\n\nthe rental rate will be $31.17/pole for the remaining three (3) years of the\n\nAgreement.” According to Tri-County, the $31.17 rate was a clerical error, and it\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\ftold Verizon later that the rate should be $29.21 instead. Beginning in 2009, Tri-\n\nCounty began billing Verizon at the $29.21 per pole rate because Verizon’s\n\nattachments remained on Tri-County’s poles and were being used by Verizon;\n\nVerizon has not paid pole rental since the termination date. 1\n\n      In late 2009 or early 2010, Tri-County realized that Verizon had not been\n\nseeking permits for new attachments to Tri-County’s poles for some time; thus,\n\nTri-County engaged a third-party consultant to inventory its poles. According to\n\nTri-County, from 2004 to 2010 its records had shown that Verizon had 5,307\n\nattachments to Tri-County’s poles, but the inventory showed that Verizon had\n\napproximately 7,523 attachments to Tri-County’s poles.\n\n      In October 2010, Tri-County sued Verizon (1) for breach of contract for\n\nfailing to pay rental to Tri-County for its attachments to Tri-County’s poles for the\n\nyears 2008, 2009, and 2010 2 and (2) breach of contract, trespass, and trespass\n\nto try title for failing to remove its attachments from Tri-County’s poles after the\n\ntermination date of the JUA. Tri-County also sought a declaratory judgment that\n\nVerizon had breached the JUA, that Tri-County had properly terminated the JUA,\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        In late 2009, Verizon tendered payment to Tri-County of $11.80 per pole,\nbut Tri-County returned the check because it was not in full satisfaction of Tri-\nCounty’s rental demand. Tri-County also sought additional rental for 2005–2007,\nbut it has not challenged the summary judgment as to its claim for rental for\nthose years.\n      2\n       Per the JUA, the 2010 rental would not be billed until 2011.\n\n\n                                         4\n\fthat Verizon must remove its attachments from Tri-County’s poles, and that Tri-\n\nCounty is entitled to the 2008–2009 rental it was seeking.\n\n      Tri-County amended its petition twice; its second amended petition\n\nexpanded its breach of contract allegations to include Verizon’s alleged failure to\n\nobtain Tri-County’s prior permission when making additional attachments to\n\npoles and sought breach of contract damages and declaratory relief for unpaid\n\nrentals from 2005 “to the present.” 3 Additionally, Tri-County also sought to enjoin\n\nVerizon from adding future attachments to its poles.\n\n      Verizon filed a motion for summary judgment on all of Tri-County’s claims,\n\nand Tri-County filed a motion for partial summary judgment. At a hearing on the\n\nmotions in November 2013, the visiting trial judge verbally granted Verizon’s\n\nsummary judgment motion. When the judge indicated that he would consider\n\ngranting Verizon attorney’s fees, Tri-County’s counsel argued that Verizon had\n\nnot pled for attorney’s fees in its answer even though it had requested attorney’s\n\nfees in its motion for summary judgment. Verizon filed a motion for leave to\n\namend its answer to include a request for attorney’s fees and to amend its\n\nmotion for summary judgment to present evidence of reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney’s fees. The trial court granted Verizon’s motion for leave to amend both\n\npleadings.   Additionally, the trial court signed an order denying Tri-County’s\n\n      3\n        Although Tri-County originally premised its breach of contract claim on\nVerizon’s alleged failure to pay the rental rate Tri-County had demanded in its\nNovember 2003 letter, its second amended petition alleged that Verizon had\nfailed to pay “an appropriate rental rate.”\n\n\n                                         5\n\fmotion for partial summary judgment, and a final, take-nothing judgment for\n\nVerizon, awarding it $1,100,000 in attorney’s fees for proceedings in the trial\n\ncourt and $150,000 in attorney’s fees in the event of an unsuccessful appeal by\n\nTri-County.\n\n                             II.    Issues on Appeal\n\n      In its first issue, with four subissues, Tri-County challenges the trial court’s\n\ngranting the summary judgment for Verizon and denying the partial summary\n\njudgment motion filed by Tri-County. In its subissues, Tri-County contends as\n\nfollows: (1) it validly terminated the JUA, which required Verizon to remove all its\n\nattachments to Tri-County’s poles as of the termination date, (2) there is at least\n\na fact issue as to whether Verizon is a holdover tenant, (3) Verizon has breached\n\nthe JUA because it (a) has not paid rental since the termination date although it\n\nmaintains and continues to use attachments on Tri-County’s poles, (b) at least a\n\nfact issue exists as to Verizon’s failure to report new attachments to Tri-County’s\n\npoles, (c) Verizon failed to provide cost and charge information in good faith in\n\nresponse to Tri-County’s 2003 request, and (4) there is some evidence to\n\nsupport an award of exemplary damages.            In its second issue, Tri-County\n\ncontends that the trial court abused its discretion by granting Verizon leave to\n\namend its pleadings to include a request for an award of attorney’s fees and that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion by overruling Tri-County’s objections to\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fVerizon’s summary judgment evidence of fees. 4 Finally, in its third issue, Tri-\n\nCounty contends that if this court reverses the take-nothing summary judgment, it\n\nmust also reverse the award of attorney’s fees to Verizon and the take-nothing\n\nsummary judgment on attorney’s fees sought by Tri-County.\n\n               III.

Allegations in Second Amended Petition\n\n      Tri-County alleged that after it terminated the JUA, Verizon failed to\n\nremove its attachments from Tri-County’s poles; Tri-County contends this failure\n\nto remove constituted a wrongful holdover.         Tri-County also alleged that in\n\ninvestigating the conflict, it discovered that Verizon had placed additional\n\nattachments on the poles without prior permission as required by the JUA.\n\nAccording to Tri-County, this discovery prompted it to engage an outside\n\ncontractor to inventory all of the attachments on its poles.\n\n      Consequently, Tri-County alleged that Verizon had breached the JUA by\n\nfailing to provide correct information regarding the extent of its attachments to\n\nTri-County’s poles, as required to calculate the applicable rental rate, and by\n\nadding additional attachments to its poles without prior permission. Tri-County\n\nalso sought unpaid rental from 2005 through the date of judgment, a declaratory\n\njudgment defining the rights, powers, and privileges of Verizon “with regard to the\n\n\n                                          8\n\fuse of [Tri-County] facilities, and specifically . . . an order directing Verizon to\n\nremove its attachments and to cease and desist from further use of any poles”\n\nbelonging to Tri-County. Tri-County further sought to recover the cost of the\n\ninventory.   Alternatively, Tri-County sought damages and injunctive relief for\n\ntrespass and trespass to try title.     Finally, Tri-County sought an award of\n\nexemplary damages and attorney’s fees under section 37.009 and chapter 38 of\n\nthe civil practice and remedies code.\n\nC.    Verizon’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n      Verizon alleged, “In this case, the parties disagree over the frequency and\n\nmanner in which the price and quantity terms may be adjusted under their JUA[].”\n\nVerizon argued that (1) it had not breached the JUA because the JUA “clearly\n\nand unambiguously require[s] payment of only rentals that are ‘agreed upon,’”\n\n(2) Tri-County “cannot prove its trespass claims (Counts 2–3) because\n\nVerizon . . . has the right to remain on [Tri-County’s] poles under the JUA and\n\nTexas law,” (3) Tri-County “cannot show that the pole inventory was caused by\n\nallegedly ‘wrongful acts’ (Count 1) that were only discovered because of the\n\ninventory,” and (4) because Tri-County cannot prevail on Counts 1–3, it also\n\ncannot recover attorney’s fees, exemplary damages, and declaratory judgment\n\nrelief in that, as pleaded, they are all dependent on its prevailing on Counts 1–3.\n\n      Verizon also contended that Tri-County could not recover for breach of\n\ncontract because it could not show that it had complied with the JUA in that its\n\nattempt to impose new rentals was directly contrary to the plain language of the\n\n\n                                         9\n\fJUA requiring the “mutual agreement of the parties” and that Tri-County’s\n\ndemands for increased rentals beginning in 2003 violated the JUA’s provision\n\nprohibiting “rates from being adjusted more frequently than every five years.”\n\n      Citing articles XI(a), XII, and Appendix B of the JUA, Verizon argued that\n\nthe plain language of the JUA unambiguously provides that any new rentals must\n\nbe “agreed upon” before they can be put in “the annual bill next rendered.”\n\nPeriodic increases are to be based on “joint review and adjustment” by\n\nagreement. According to Verizon, “[t]his plain language unambiguously requires\n\nagreement before rentals can be increased through either rate or pole count\n\nincreases.”\n\n      Regarding Tri-County’s trespass claim, Verizon argued that Article XX of\n\nthe JUA regarding termination and Article XIII, the default provision which is\n\nreferenced in Article XX, are silent about the removal of attachments from Tri-\n\nCounty’s poles; therefore, removal is not required upon termination. Verizon also\n\nargued that the JUA allows it to maintain existing attachments even after\n\ntermination and that Tri-County had irrevocably elected to “treat [it] as a tenant,\n\nrather than a trespasser” by demanding rent, engaging in negotiations for a new\n\nJUA, suing for past due rent under the JUA, and by alleging in its petition that\n\nVerizon was a holdover tenant. Verizon contended that the termination provision\n\nin Article XX applies only to the future granting of additional joint use and that,\n\ntherefore, all attachments made prior to termination are attachments existing on\n\nthe date of termination.\n\n\n                                        10\n\f      Regarding the inventory, Verizon alleged factually that it had no notice or\n\nparticipation in the inventory process, that the inventory counted “poles to which\n\nVerizon . . . is not actually attached,” that it counted “some poles twice,” and that\n\nit assumed “ownership of all poles as [Tri-County] poles ‘unless obvious in the\n\nfield.’” It also contended Tri-County had not alleged any breach of the JUA that\n\nwas a but-for cause of the inventory, that the JUA did not require Verizon to pay\n\nfor such an inventory, and that there is no evidence that Verizon engaged in any\n\nwrongful acts necessitating the inventory (i.e., breach of contract). According to\n\nVerizon, “If the only evidence of the alleged wrongful acts is the results of the\n\ninventory, the inventory cannot, by definition, be the natural, probable, or\n\nforeseeable consequence of those allegedly wrongful acts.”\n\n      Finally, Verizon alleged that Tri-County’s pleaded relief for a declaratory\n\njudgment, exemplary damages, and attorney’s fees all fail because they are\n\ndependent on Tri-County’s recovering under the breach of contract or trespass\n\ncauses of action. It also contended that Tri-County had produced no evidence of\n\nfraud, malice, or gross negligence sufficient to raise a fact issue on its entitlement\n\nto exemplary damages. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 41.003(a)\n\n(West 2015).\n\n      1. Tri-County’s Response\n\n      In its response, Tri-County argued that the plain language of the JUA\n\nprovides that rental rates are to be determined according to the formula set forth\n\nin Appendix B, the primary objective of which is an equitable sharing of costs.\n\n\n                                         11\n\fAdditionally, Tri-County contended that Article IV of the JUA requires Verizon to\n\nrequest permission before adding new attachments and that Article XX gave it an\n\nunconditional right to terminate the JUA upon three years’ notice after the\n\nexpiration of twenty-five years from the JUA’s effective date. It further argued\n\nthat it can recover damages for paying for the pole inventory because it would\n\nnot have needed to do so absent Verizon’s breaches in (1) failing to get written\n\npermission to attach additional attachments and (2) failing to pay rent for those\n\nattachments as required by the JUA.\n\n      Tri-County also responded that the motion as to its trespass claim is\n\npremature because it pled trespass as an alternative to breach of contract and\n\nbecause genuine issues of material fact exist. As part of this argument, Tri-\n\nCounty argued that Verizon is not entitled to keep its attachments on Tri-County’s\n\npoles in perpetuity because Texas law disfavors perpetual leases.\n\n      2. Verizon’s Reply\n\n      Verizon responded that there is no evidence that it refused to negotiate\n\nregarding rentals, that the evidence shows that it did negotiate and that\n\nagreements were made in past years, and that Tri-County is the one refusing to\n\ncooperate. Verizon also disputed Tri-County’s argument that the “not less than 5\n\nyears” provision does not apply post-termination of the JUA because (1) it is not\n\na holdover tenant and (2) that argument contradicts Tri-County’s own argument\n\nthat the JUA applies during a holdover.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fD.   Tri-County’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Verizon’s\nResponse\n\n      Tri-County reiterated the arguments from its response to Verizon’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment: (1) that its notice of termination effectively terminated the\n\nJUA, (2) that it had the right to require Verizon to remove its attachments from\n\nTri-County’s poles as of February 1, 2008, and (3) that Verizon is a holdover\n\ntenant.   Tri-County also reiterated its argument that Appendix B to the JUA\n\ngoverns the calculation of rent. In its response, Verizon re-urged the arguments\n\nfrom its motion for summary judgment and also claimed that Tri-County’s\n\n“counter-textual” interpretation of Appendix B would allow Tri-County to\n\nunilaterally impose a rental rate on Verizon.\n\nE.

Relevant Provisions of JUA\n\n      Because we must construe the JUA in its entirety, and because all of the\n\nprovisions of the JUA must be examined to understand the underpinnings of the\n\nparties’ intent and purpose, we will excerpt the relevant provisions below.\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f         Article I, entitled “Scope of Agreement,” subsection (c) states, “It is the\n\nintention of the parties that adequate telephone service shall be made available\n\nto the widest practicable number of rural users in the above territory.”             In\n\nArticle III, the JUA sets forth specifications for the poles that are to be jointly used\n\nand states that such poles\n\n         shall at all times be in conformity with accepted modern methods\n         such as those suggested in Edison Electric Institute Publication No.\n         M12 and shall at all times conform to the requirements of the\n         National Electrical Safety Code, Fifth Edition . . . except where the\n         lawful requirements of public authorities may be more stringent.\n\n         Article IV sets forth a procedure requiring Verizon to request permission in\n\nwriting on a delineated, attached form before “mak[ing] use of [Tri-County’s]\n\npoles.” It further states, “Whenever either party desires to reserve space for its\n\nattachments on any pole owned by the other party, either as initial space or\n\nadditional space on such pole, it shall make written application therefor . . . [and]\n\nthe owner . . . shall have the right to reject the application.” [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe JUA also requires a party desiring to change “the character of its circuits on\n\njointly used poles” to give sixty days’ notice to the other party and also provides\n\nguidelines for resolving any dispute if the other party failed to timely approve the\n\nchange.\n\n         Article V(b) governs how the joint use of each party’s poles is to be\n\nestablished, including a provision providing guidance for the ownership of such\n\npoles:\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\f             (b) In any case where the parties hereto shall conclude\n      arrangements for the joint use of any new poles to be erected, and\n      the party proposing to construct the new poles facilities already owns\n      more than its proportionate share of joint poles, the parties shall take\n      into consideration the desirability of having the new pole facilities\n      owned by the party owning less than its proportionate share of joint\n      poles so as to work towards such a division of ownership of the joint\n      poles that neither party shall be obligated to pay to the other any\n      rentals because of their respective use of joint poles owned by the\n      other.\n\nThe JUA further provides formulas for the allocation of costs between the parties\n\nfor the construction of new poles, depending on which party’s usage\n\nrequirements necessitated new poles. The cost of maintenance of a joint-use\n\npole is allocated to the owner of that pole.\n\n      Article X provides a mechanism for either party to abandon a jointly used\n\npole by giving the other party sixty days’ prior notice; if at the end of that sixty-\n\nday period, the owner removes all of its attachments from the pole, the other\n\nparty may, if it still has attachments on the pole, keep those attachments in place\n\nand pay the abandoning party “the then value in place of the pole . . . but in no\n\ncase an amount less than the net salvage value of the pole.” Subsection (b)\n\nprovides: “The licensee may at any time abandon the use of a joint pole by\n\ngiving due notice thereof in writing to the owner and by removing therefrom any\n\nand all attachments it may have thereon.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f      Pole rental is calculated on January 1 of each year based on “the\n\nperpetual inventory of poles as reflected on the latest application and permit.” 5\n\nArticle XI, the rental paragraph, was amended in all of the JUA amendments\n\nexcept the 1998 amendment to the Southwestern States contract. The 1993\n\namendment to the Southwestern States contract stated as follows:\n\n      The rentals per pole due from either party as licensee to the other\n      party as owner shall be based on the equitable sharing of the\n      economics of joint use as provided for in Appendix B. Subject to the\n      provision of Article XII, $8.82 per annum shall be paid by [Tri-\n      County] for each jointly-used pole owned by [Verizon] and $7.25 per\n      annum shall be paid by [Verizon] for each jointly-used pole owned\n      by [Tri-County]. The smaller total sum shall be deducted from the\n      larger and [Tri-County] or [Verizon], as the case may be, shall pay to\n      the other the difference between such amounts. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe 1981 amendment to the Continental contract changed Article XI(d) to read\n\nas follows: “Subject to the provisions of Article XII, $9.37 per annum shall be\n\npaid by [Tri-County] for each jointly used pole owned by [Verizon], and $6.25 per\n\nannum shall be paid by [Verizon] for each jointly used pole owned by [Tri-\n\nCounty].”\n\n      Article XII, entitled “Periodical Adjustment of Rentals,” reads in its entirety:\n\n             (a)  At any time after 5 years from the date of this\n      Agreement and at intervals of not less than 5 years thereafter, the\n      rentals applicable under this Agreement shall be subject to joint\n      review and adjustment as provided for under Section (b) of this\n      Article upon the written request of either party. In case of\n      adjustment of rentals as herein provided, the new rentals agreed\n\n\n      5\n       Although the wording of this part of Article XI differs in the Continental\ncontract, it is substantively the same.\n\n\n                                         17\n\f      upon shall apply starting with the annual bill next rendered and\n      continuing until again adjusted.\n\n             (b)   All adjustments of rental shall be in accord with the\n      provisions of Appendix B, and any changes shall take into account\n      the cost factors originally involved in all joint use existing at that time\n      under this Agreement. [Emphasis added.]\n\n      Appendix B, referred to in, and attached to, both the Southwestern States\n\nand Continental contracts is set forth below:\n\n            This Appendix describes the basic principles and guides which\n      have been used under this Agreement in setting the rents specified\n      in Article XI and which are to be used in making periodical\n      adjustments of rentals as provided for in Article XII.\n\n             Under these principles the rentals are intended, in so far as it\n      is practicable, to result in a sharing of the economies realized by the\n      joint use of pole plant in proportion to the relative costs of separate\n      pole line construction.\n\n            The procedures outlined herein take into account the\n            following objectives:\n\n            1. An equitable division of savings regardless of the\n            number of jointly used poles owned by each party.\n\n            2. Rental rates applicable universally in the area\n            covered by the Agreement regardless of whether the\n            pole lines involved are initially constructed with joint use\n            in view or are existing lines modified for joint use.\n\n            3.    Appropriate allowance in the rental rates for\n            additional costs incurred by each party in supplying\n            ‘normal joint poles’, as defined in the Agreement, and\n            the costs of other items required in the joint use of poles\n            which would not be incurred in separate line\n            construction.\n\n            4. Rentals based on the costs of “typical miles” of\n            separate lines, of newly constructed joint lines and of\n            existing lines modified to make them suitable for joint\n\n\n                                          18\n\f         use. The ‘per mile’ values of rentals are then reduced\n         to ‘per pole’ values for purpose of simplifying tabulations\n         and to provide for the joint use of scattered poles.\n\n        The rentals are the dollar values resulting from the licensee\n paying to the owner, as annual rental, an amount representing the\n annual charge on a separate line for the licensee less the sum of\n (a) the annual charges on the additional costs incurred by the\n licensee in establishing joint use and (b), the licensee’s share of the\n total annual savings. This share is the ratio of the Licensee’s typical\n separate line costs to the sum of the typical separate line costs of\n each of the parties.\n\n         The annual rent payable can also be stated as follows:\n\n                         Annual charges                                 Total savings in\n                         saved by                  Licensee’s           an[n]ual\nLicensee’s               licensee                                       charges\nannual rent   (Equals)   through not      (Less)   appropriate   (Of)   realized\n                         having                    percentage           through\n                         to build a                                     joint use\n                         separate\n                         line\n\n        The cost in place of a line of poles is made up of a number of\n factors including such items as right-of-way solicitation, clearing,\n staking, direct labor and material costs of bare poles in place and\n pro rata shares of construction supervision and overhead. These\n costs, for a specific area, may differ considerably from\n corresponding costs in other parts of the country. These variations\n in pole line costs will, however, affect both power and telephone\n lines to about the same degree.\n\n        The parties to this contract will mutually agree on the average\n cost of a typical mile of 35 foot, class 6 poles in place in their\n common area. Below are tabulated appropriate rentals over a range\n of typical mile costs. From this tabulation, the parties shall use the\n rental payments associated with the value nearest to the agreed\n upon average cost.\n\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\f                               RENTAL PAYMENTS\n\n           WHERE THE        THE TELEPHONE                THE COOPERATIVE’S\n       MUTUALLY AGREED     COMPANY’S ANNUAL                ANNUAL RENTAL\n      UPON AVERAGE COST RENTAL PAYMENT PER               PAYMENT PER POLE\n            PER MILE         POLE TO THE                 TO THE TELEPHONE\n       OF 35 FOOT CLASS 6 COOPERATIVE WILL BE             COMPANY WILL BE\n        POLES IN PLACE\n         APPROXIMATES\n              $350.*[ 6]               $1.00                     $1.70\n               410.                     1.10                      1.80\n               470.                     1.20                      1.90\n               530.                     1.30                      2.00\n               590.                     1.40                      2.10\n               650.                     1.50                      2.20\n               710.                     1.60                      2.30\n               770.**                   1.70                      2.40\n\n      *Rentals associated with this amount are minimum and applicable\n      for all lower costs.\n\n      **If average costs are substantially higher than this value,\n      appropriate rentals should be determined by agreement.\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n      The default provision, Article XIII, provides that if either party defaults in its\n\nobligations for thirty days after written notice from the other party, the\n\nnondefaulting party can “suspend the rights of the party in default in so far as\n\nconcerns the granting of future joint use” and if after such a suspension, the\n\ndefaulting party remains in default for sixty days thereafter, the nondefaulting\n\nparty can terminate the JUA “as far as concerns the future granting of joint use.”\n\n      6\n        Although the table and the notes delineated by asterisks are included in\nAppendix B to the Southwestern States contract, the amounts and at least the\nfirst asterisk are crossed out in the Appendix B attached to the Continental\ncontract. Although the second asterisk is not crossed out in the Continental\ncontract, the number it is next to is crossed out.\n\n\n                                          20\n\fThe default provision further gives the nondefaulting party the option of fulfilling\n\nthe defaulting party’s obligation with the right of reimbursement from the\n\ndefaulting party for the expense.\n\n      Finally, Article XX of the JUA, entitled “Term of Agreement,” states,\n\n            Subject to the provisions of Article XIII, Defaults, herein, this\n      Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated at the end of 25\n      years from the date hereof or thereafter upon the giving of written\n      notice to the other party not less than three years prior to the date of\n      termination.\n\nG.    Analysis\n\n      1. JUA Contemplates Removal of Attachments Upon Termination\n\n      The initial issue we must resolve is whether Verizon is required to remove\n\nits existing attachments from Tri-County’s poles upon termination of the JUA\n\nunder Article XX; this is a basis for Tri-County’s breach of contract claim and its\n\nalternative trespass claims. Because the termination provision in Article XX does\n\nnot expressly state that all attachments to joint use poles must be removed upon\n\ntermination, the parties argued in the trial court and on appeal that Texas law\n\nregarding leases applies to govern the disposition of the attachments upon\n\ntermination. Tri-County cites cases holding that Texas law disfavors perpetual\n\nleases and the common law that a landlord has the right to receive the property\n\nback at the end of the term; Verizon cites law in support of its argument that the\n\nparties intended in the JUA to create a perpetual right to lease the poles.\n\nVerizon also argues that the JUA “plainly (1) limit[s] termination of the right to\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\foccupy utility poles to the ‘future granting of joint use’ and (2) require[s] that new\n\nrental rates be ‘agreed upon.’”\n\n          Before applying common law regarding the disposition of property at the\n\nend of a lease term, we must first determine whether the JUA itself contemplates\n\nthat each party’s attachments should be removed from the other’s poles upon the\n\nexercise of the termination provision in Article XX; in doing so, we must consider\n\nthe context of the entire JUA and its overriding purpose. See, e.g., NP Anderson\n\nCotton Exch., L.P., 230 S.W.3d at 463. That purpose is clearly stated in the JUA\n\nitself:    to provide “adequate telephone service . . . to the widest practicable\n\nnumber of rural users” (Article I) with as equitable of a division of poles as\n\npossible so as to come as close as possible to the net result that neither party\n\nwould have to pay rent to the other (Article V(b)). To that end, the JUA allocates\n\ncosts of pole maintenance, construction, and load (Articles IV, VII, and VIII).\n\n          Although Article XX does not expressly state that removal of attachments\n\nto a joint use pole is required upon termination of the JUA, another provision\n\ndoes contemplate when removal is required: Article X requires the removal of a\n\nnonowner’s attachments to a joint use pole in the event the nonowner decides it\n\nno longer wants to utilize the pole as a joint pole, which the owner may do at any\n\ntime:\n\n                 (a)   If the owner desires at any time to abandon any jointly\n          used pole, it shall give the licensee notice in writing to that effect at\n          least 60 days prior to the date on which it intends to abandon such\n          pole. If at the expiration of said period the owner shall have no\n          attachments on such pole but the licensee shall not have removed\n\n\n                                             22\n\f      all of the attachments therefrom, such pole shall thereupon become\n      the property of the licensee, and the licensee shall save harmless\n      the former owner of such pole from all obligation, liability, damages,\n      cost, expenses or charges incurred thereafter, and not arising out of\n      anything theretofore occurring, because of, or arising out of, the\n      presence or condition of such pole or of any attachments thereon;\n      and shall pay the owner the then value in place of the pole to the\n      licensee but in no case an amount less than the net salvage value of\n      the pole to the owner as provided in Appendix A attached hereto.\n      The former owner shall further evidence transfer of title to the pole\n      by means of a bill of sale. . . .\n\n            (b)    The licensee may at any time abandon the use of a joint\n      pole by giving due notice thereof in writing to the owner and by\n      removing therefrom any and all attachments it may have thereon.\n      The licensee shall in such case pay to the owner the full rental for\n      said pole for the then current year. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThis provision shows that the parties intended that nonowner attachments would\n\nbe allowed to remain only on owner-designated joint use poles for which rental is\n\npaid unless the nonowner desired to purchase the pole.\n\n      The considerable investment involved in providing such widespread\n\ntelephone service as possible, in addition to ensuring continuing access to\n\ntelephone service in more rural areas, are presumably two of the reasons for the\n\nrestriction of termination of the JUA until the expiration of at least twenty-five\n\nyears from its effective date. See, e.g., Pub. Util. Comm’n of Tex. v. Tex. Tel.\n\nAss’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1684706\"><a href=\"/opinion/1684706/public-utility-comn-v-texas-telephone-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207 (Tex. App.––Austin 2005, no pet.) (“One of the goals\n\nof the Federal Communications Commission (‘FCC’) is to ensure that all\n\nAmericans have access to affordable phone service.”). The plain language of\n\nthat provision, Article XX, imposes no restriction on the termination of the JUA\n\n\n\n\n                                       23\n\fafter the initial twenty-five year period other than that three years’ prior notice\n\nmust be given.\n\n      Verizon argues that the initial clause, “Subject to the provisions of Article\n\nXIII, Defaults, herein,” imposes the requirements of the default provision into the\n\ntermination provision; in other words, that the potential and logical consequences\n\nof a party’s termination of the JUA are “subject to” and thus limited by the\n\nremedies outlined in the default provision.       But Verizon has confused the\n\ntermination and default provisions in the JUA. In the context of the entire JUA,\n\nthis introductory clause must be construed to modify and provide an exception to\n\nthe part of the termination clause that sets a per se initial term of twenty-five\n\nyears. See Spiritas v. Rabinowitz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1512712\"><a href=\"/opinion/1512712/spiritas-v-robinowitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 718–19 (Tex. App.––Dallas\n\n1976, writ ref’d n.r.e.). For the default provision to provide such an exception, it\n\nmust be different in some way from the termination provision. Thus, referencing\n\nthe default provision, the construction that contextualizes the two most clearly, in\n\nfurtherance of the purpose of the JUA, is that the only exception to the twenty-\n\nfive year initial term––or subsequent three-year lead time of later termination––is\n\nthat a nondefaulting party can deny future attachments to joint poles in the event\n\nof a default within the initial twenty-five-year term.    Importantly, the default\n\nprovision does not suspend the defaulting party’s obligation to pay rental for\n\nthen-current attachments during an event of default.        Thus, to construe the\n\ntermination provision to allow each party to continue using the other’s poles rent-\n\nfree after the termination date would mean the termination provision would have\n\n\n                                        24\n\fno effect at all. Accordingly, we construe the termination provision to require that\n\neach party remove its attachments from the other’s joint use poles; to do so\n\notherwise would render the entire purpose of a termination provision\n\nmeaningless and would convert the JUA into a perpetual right governed only by\n\ncommon law, which is not contemplated by the remainder of the JUA.

See id.\n\n      Moreover, Article VI of the JUA makes it clear that the parties’ occupation\n\nof joint use poles is subject to the existing property rights of other landowners,\n\nand it expressly disavows any warranty of easement or right-of-way rights. To\n\nthe extent then that Verizon is using Tri-County’s poles pursuant to easement\n\n\n                                        25\n\frights granted to Tri-County by a landowner, Verizon’s use and occupation of the\n\npoles is subordinate to the duration and scope of those easements.

Applicable Law\n\n      In Coinmach, the supreme court explained the law regarding the status of\n\na tenant who remains in possession of leased premises after the expiration of the\n\nlease term:\n\n             A tenant at will is a holdover tenant who “holds possession\n      with the landlord’s consent but without fixed terms (as to duration or\n      rent).” Because tenants at will remain in possession with their\n      landlords’ consent, their possession is lawful, but it is for no fixed\n      term, and the landlords can put them out of possession at any time.\n      By contrast, a tenant at sufferance is “[a] tenant who has been in\n      lawful possession of property and wrongfully remains as a holdover\n      after the tenant’s interest has expired.” The defining characteristic of\n      a tenancy at sufferance is the lack of the landlord’s consent to the\n      tenant’s continued possession of the premises. With the owner’s\n      consent, the holdover tenant becomes a tenant at will; without it, a\n      tenant at sufferance.\n\n            A lease agreement may provide that its terms continue to\n      apply to a holdover tenant. But if, as here, the lease does not\n      address the issue, and if the parties do not enter into a new lease\n\n      9\n        Verizon did not move for summary judgment on the opposite ground: that\ntreating it as a tenant-at-sufferance precluded a claim for breach of contract for\nthe failure to pay rent during the wrongful holdover. See Coinmach Corp., 417\nS.W.3d at 917. Verizon also alleges in footnote 7 of its brief that Tri-County\nvoluntarily dropped its holdover tenancy claim in the Second Amended Petition;\nhowever, Tri-County’s alternative breach of contract and trespass claims are not\nonly based on the allegation that Verizon owes Tri-County damages for\nremaining on its poles after the termination date, Tri-County uses the term\n“holdover tenant” in its allegations as to both theories of recovery.\n\n\n                                        27\n\f      agreement, the parties’ conduct will determine whether the holdover\n      tenant becomes a tenant at will or a tenant at sufferance. “Under\n      the common law holdover rule, a landlord may elect to treat a tenant\n      holding over as either a trespasser”––that is, a tenant at\n      sufferance—“or as a tenant holding under the terms of the original\n      lease”––that is, a tenant at will. Thus, an implied agreement to\n      create a new lease using the terms of the prior lease may arise if\n      both parties engage in conduct that manifests such intent. If the\n      tenant remains in possession and continues to pay rent, and the\n      landlord, having knowledge of the tenant’s possession, continues to\n      accept the rent without objection to the continued possession, the\n      tenant is a tenant at will, and the terms of the prior lease will\n      continue to govern the new arrangement absent an agreement to\n      the contrary. The mere fact that the tenant remains in possession,\n      however, is not sufficient to create a tenancy at will; unless the\n      parties’ conduct demonstrates the landlord’s consent to the\n      continued possession, the tenant is a tenant at sufferance.\n\nId. at 915–16 (citations omitted). The supreme court went on to hold that the\n\nparties’ conduct in that case––which had been tried to a jury––showed (1) that\n\nthe landlord did not consent to the holdover and thus elected to treat the tenant\n\nas a tenant at sufferance, (2) that no lease governed the conduct of the parties\n\nduring the holdover period, and, therefore, (3) that the landlord could only\n\nrecover damages attributable to the holdover period under its trespass theories\n\nrather than a breach of contract theory. See id. at 916–17, 922–23.\n\n      We must, therefore, determine if Verizon conclusively proved that Tri-\n\nCounty elected to treat it as a tenant at will or if a fact issue exists.\n\n             b. Evidence of Parties’ Post-termination Conduct\n\n      Tri-County’s 2005 termination letter indicated, “Termination will be effective\n\nat the close of business on February 1, 2008. According to Article XX, Verizon\n\nmust remove its facilities from Tri-County Electric poles by termination date.”\n\n\n                                           28\n\fThis appears to show that Tri-County initially did not consent to Verizon’s\n\nholdover tenancy.\n\n      But the summary judgment record also contains correspondence between\n\nTri-County and Verizon indicating that Tri-County and Verizon attempted to\n\nnegotiate either an amendment to the JUA or a new agreement after the\n\ntermination date. A May 16, 2007 email from David Moore with Tri-County to\n\nStuart Shiller with Verizon indicates that Tri-County was interested in negotiating\n\namendments to the JUA. Another email from Moore to Shiller dated June 29,\n\n2009, over a year after the termination date, stated, “I would like to meet . . . .\n\nWe need to start the process of negotiating a new amendment to the joint use\n\nagreement between Verizon and Tri-County Electric. I intend to have our outside\n\ncounsel, Rebecca Price, present at the meeting. You may also bring counsel.”\n\nAnother email dated September 25, 2009 acknowledged that Verizon had offered\n\nto “purchase poles to achieve a parity ratio of 45% [Verizon] and 55%” Tri-County\n\nand showed that the parties had exchanged draft documents. The email also\n\nstated, “During our last meeting, you indicated that you intended to review the\n\ntermination provisions of the current agreement and [Verizon’s] rights after\n\ntermination. Could you share with us the results of that review?” [Emphasis\n\nadded.] Finally, a third email dated October 27, 2009 stated:\n\n      I misspoke concerning the rental rate that Tri-County will accept for\n      2008. We have billed for the 2008 cont[r]acts in an invoice dated\n      February 2, 2009. I have attached a scanned copy of the invoice.\n      Tri-County . . . will only accept the full amount for the 2008\n      cont[r]acts. If we negotiate some other amount with a new\n\n\n                                        29\n\f      agreement, then any difference will be refunded or credited as\n      appropriate.\n\nThe record also contains copies of invoices from Tri-County to Verizon for pole\n\nrental due in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.\n\n      Tri-County’s counsel sent a demand letter to Verizon dated January 21,\n\n2010, which stated as follows:\n\n              Our firm represents Tri-County Electric Cooperative, Inc. in\n      connection with the attachments to its poles and specifically the\n      attachments of your company Verizon. I have your letter of\n      December 23, 2009 to Mr. David Moore of Tri-County. Enclosed you\n      will find your company’s check for annual pole attachment rental\n      which is not consistent with the invoice or the prior [JUA].\n\n            The invoice was billed in accordance with a calculation under\n      Appendix B to the now terminated [JUA]. That agreement was\n      terminated pursuant to notice given you dated January 20, 2005.\n      Pursuant to the agreement you had three years to remove your\n      attachments from Tri-County’s poles but did not do so. Your\n      continued occupancy of those poles makes you a holdover tenant,\n      holding over under the prior [JUA].\n\n             Your conclusion is that, because the agreement was\n      terminated, your occupancy on those poles is not governed by the\n      prior agreement and rate calculation. You are incorrect. As with any\n      holdover tenant, under the law, the prior agreement governs the time\n      you are holding over even though you may be and are a trespasser\n      on those poles.\n\n            In connection with the negotiation of a new rate, you have\n      proposed the FCC Telecom formula. You know of course that the\n      formula has no application to Tri-County. As an electric cooperative,\n      Tri-County is excluded from the FCC jurisdiction over pole\n      attachment rates as that is left to state regulation. As you also know,\n      Texas has not chosen to exercise jurisdiction or to regulate pole\n      attachment rates or contracts. Therefore, your entitlement to be on\n      the poles of Tri-County is purely a matter of negotiated contract and\n      presently, you have refused to pay as a holdover tenant under the\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\fprior agreement and also chosen not to remove your attachments\nfrom the poles.\n\n      ....\n\n        Tri-County Electric is willing to sit down with you and negotiate\na new pole attachment rental agreement which would include new\nrates. It is not, however, willing to apply the FCC Telecom formula\nor to accept a rate such as you propose in your December 23 letter.\nAs a good faith gesture, you should pay the rental rates billed you\npursuant to Appendix B for 2008 and 2009 and contact me to\narrange for a time to discuss and hopefully negotiate a new\nagreement. If you choose not to proceed in this manner I will have\nno choice but to recommend to my client that it pursue all\nappropriate remedies available to it, which may include commencing\nlitigation against Verizon for recovery of rental rates for the years\n2008 and 2009 based on the Appendix B formula as a holdover\ntenant, for costs and attorneys’ fees, and for an appropriate order\nwith respect to your continued occupancy of space on Tri-County’s\npoles.\n\n       It is Tri-County’s intent to negotiate in good faith a rental rate\nwhich adequately covers its costs resulting from your occupancy on\nits poles. [Emphasis added.]\n\nIn a subsequent letter dated August 24, 2010, Tri-County’s counsel wrote,\n\nUnfortunately, it appears that we are at an impasse in that we\ncannot agree with your positions as stated in your letter with regard\nto pole attachment rates that should apply to Verizon’s occupation of\nTri-County poles.\n\n       By this letter, please accept this as Tri-County’s directive that\nVerizon remove all attachments from our poles as soon as possible.\nFurther, we expect Verizon to pay the full amount owed for its\nattachments including not only pole attachment rates but also\nrelated fees in the present amount of $153,129.32 for 2008 and\n2009 for a total amount of $306,258.64. Please be advised that if\nVerizon does not begin to remove all attachments from Tri-County\npoles immediately and complete that process in a reasonable time,\nand pay all amounts due and owing as stated herein, Tri-County will\nbe left with little recourse but to pursue an action against Verizon in\ncourt to get a judgment directing Verizon’s removal from our poles\n\n\n                                   31\n\fand an award of damages for amounts owed which may include not\nonly the past due rental rates, fees and penalties but also attorneys’\nfees, pre- and post-judgment interest and other costs incurred.\n\nIn Moore’s affidavit attached as summary judgment evidence, he explains,\n\n       23. Despite numerous demands, Verizon continually refused\nto pay the $29.21 rental rate during the three years after the Notice\nof Termination. It was always our intention to hold Verizon to its\nobligation to pay the $29.21 rate between the time of the Notice of\nTermination, January 20, 2005, to the time by which Verizon was\nsupposed to remove its facilities, February 1, 2008. It was never our\nintent at [Tri-County] to accept the $7.25 per pole paid by Verizon as\nfull payment, or to waive our right to collect the full amount owed\nbetween January 2005 and January 2008 ($29.21 per pole) by\napplying Verizon’s payments at the $7.25 rate to their account. Our\nintent was to reflect a credit to their account for the amount paid.\n\n       24. On or about August 24, 2010, [Tri-County] sent another\ndemand that Verizon remove its attachments from its poles. To\ndate, Verizon has failed and refused to remove its attachments from\n[Tri-County’s] poles and continues to utilize its attachments to those\npoles for the delivery of its services. Verizon has also refused to pay\n[Tri-County] the rental rates that [it] has demanded for the use of\nsuch attachments from February 1, 2008 to the present. When\npayments for a lesser amount were received from Verizon during\nthis time period, [Tri-County] rejected all such payments on the\nadvice of its attorneys. At no time since February 1, 2008, has [Tri-\nCounty] agreed or otherwise consented to allow Verizon to remain\nattached to its poles.\n\n      25. Given Verizon’s refusal to remove its attachments from\n[Tri-County’s] poles, and its refusal to pay the $29.21 rate that had\nbeen demanded for the January 2005 to January 2008 time period,\n[Tri-County] again calculated the rental rate per pole that should be\npaid by Verizon to [Tri-County] for the time period of January 2008 to\nJanuary 2013 to be $37.04, $39.76, $40.95, $40.53, and $40.53\nrespectively. It was always our understanding at [Tri-County] that\nthe provisions of the Contract that implied that the parties had a right\nto request a rate adjustment no more than every five years applied\nonly once an appropriate rate calculated in accordance with\nAppendix B was being paid by the parties. That never occurred\n\n\n\n                                  32\n\f      between [Tri-County] and Verizon after [Tri-County] first requested\n      the rate adjustment in 2003. [Emphasis added.]\n\n            c. Fact Issue Exists\n\n      Verizon contends that Tri-County consented to its possession, thus\n\nprecluding a trespass claim, because Tri-County has not removed its\n\nattachments from Verizon’s poles, Tri-County has invoiced Verizon for rental\n\nafter the termination, Tri-County has negotiated with Verizon to enter into a new\n\nagreement with increased rates, and Tri-County has demanded rental under the\n\nterms of the JUA post-termination. There is at least a fact question as to whether\n\nTri-County maintains any attachments on Verizon poles; the record contains an\n\nexcerpt from Moore’s deposition in which he states that he is not sure but that he\n\nthinks that Tri-County may not have any attachments on Verizon’s poles. What\n\nthe record does show is that Tri-County told Verizon to remove its attachments\n\non the termination date in its termination notice; several months before the\n\ntermination date, Tri-County communicated to Verizon that it was interested in\n\namending the JUA; Tri-County billed Verizon for rental after the termination date\n\nat a different rate from the last amended rate in the JUA but purportedly in\n\naccordance with the formula set forth in Appendix B of the JUA; Verizon tendered\n\nrental for the year 2008 that Tri-County rejected; until August 2010, Tri-County’s\n\ncounsel’s position to Verizon was that its holdover was subject to the terms of the\n\nJUA but at the rental demanded by Tri-County; and as of August 24, 2010, Tri-\n\nCounty again demanded that Verizon remove all of its attachments.\n\n\n\n                                        33\n\f      We conclude and hold that the evidence raises a genuine issue of material\n\nfact as to whether Tri-County consented to Verizon’s holdover as a tenant at will\n\nunder the terms of the JUA. Tri-County made at least two demands that Verizon\n\nremove its attachments and it also rejected rental from Verizon. See ICM Mortg.\n\nCorp. v. Jacob, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2371541\"><a href=\"/opinion/2371541/icm-mortg-corp-v-jacob/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 533 (Tex.

In Street-Whittington Co. v. Sayres, cited by both parties, the trial court\n\nconcluded that whether the tenant’s holdover was a tenancy at will or tenancy at\n\nsufferance, based on evidence of the parties’ conduct, was a question that\n\nshould have been submitted to the jury. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3941431\"><a href=\"/opinion/4173814/street-whittington-co-v-sayres/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 776 (Tex. Civ. App.––\n\nAmarillo 1915, no writ). We believe the same reasoning applies here and that\n\nVerizon failed to prove conclusively as a matter of law that Tri-County elected to\n\ntreat it as a tenant at will rather than as a tenant at sufferance. In accordance\n\nwith the law as stated in Coinmach, whether Tri-County can recover damages\n\n\n                                         34\n\funder a breach of contract theory or trespass theory, then, depends on the\n\nresolution of this fact issue. Therefore, we conclude and hold that the trial court\n\nerred by granting summary judgment for Verizon on Tri-County’s alternatively\n\npled trespass-based claims.\n\n      Additionally, because we conclude that a fact issue exists, we also hold\n\nthat the trial court did not err by denying the remaining relief sought in Tri-\n\nCounty’s motion for a partial summary judgment except its request for a partial\n\nsummary judgment as to whether, as a matter of law, the JUA requires rental\n\nincreases to be determined in accordance with the formula set forth in\n\nAppendix B, which we discuss below.\n\n      3. Breach of Contract Claims\n\n      In its motion for summary judgment, Verizon asserted that Tri-County\n\ncannot maintain any of its breach of contract claims for unpaid rental because the\n\nJUA requires it to pay increased rentals only if they are “agreed upon” and that\n\nTri-County failed to comply with the JUA by demanding rental not required by the\n\nJUA and in violation of the provision that allows a rental increase only in five-year\n\nintervals. Tri-County argues that the parties agreed in the JUA to determine rent\n\nincreases according to the formula set forth in Appendix B. Although there is a\n\nfact question as to whether Tri-County elected to treat Verizon as a tenant at\n\nwill––and thus whether Tri-County can even recover in accordance with the\n\nJUA––we will address this issue because a resolution in Verizon’s favor would\n\npreclude Tri-County’s breach of contract action. See Mustang Pipeline Co. v.\n\n\n                                         35\n\fDriver Pipeline Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894516\"><a href=\"/opinion/894516/mustang-pipeline-co-v-driver-pipeline-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196 (Tex. 2004) (“It is a fundamental\n\nprinciple of contract law that when one party to a contract commits a material\n\nbreach of that contract, the other party is discharged or excused from further\n\nperformance.”).\n\n             a. Rental Calculation\n\n      Article XI(d) of the JUA, as amended, uses the generally mandatory term\n\n“shall” in providing that “[t]he rentals per pole due from either party as licensee to\n\nthe other party as owner shall be based on the equitable sharing of the\n\neconomics of joint use as provided for in Appendix B.” See Lesikar v. Moon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1450229\"><a href=\"/opinion/1450229/lesikar-v-moon/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367 (Tex. App.––Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied). Nothing\n\nelse in the context of this provision or the remainder of the JUA indicates that the\n\nparties intended the word to be used permissively; thus, Appendix B and “the\n\nequitable sharing of the economics of joint use” must be the basis for determining\n\nrentals due under the JUA.\n\n      Additionally, the amendments all begin the rent provisions with the clause,\n\n“Subject to the provisions of Article XII.” Article XII provides for the “joint review\n\nand adjustment” of rentals at intervals of no less than five years. But that “joint\n\nreview and adjustment” is to be “as provided for under Section (b)” of Article XII,\n\nwhich states that “[a]ll adjustments of rental shall be in accord with the provisions\n\nof Appendix B, and any changes shall take into account the cost factors originally\n\ninvolved in all joint use existing at that time under” the JUA. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThus, both Article XI and Article XII use similar mandatory language.

It is not difficult to imagine\n\nthe purpose for this:    just as the lengthy initial term would help the parties\n\nachieve more of a return on their infrastructure investment and further the\n\npurpose of facilitating the provision of services to more difficult and costly to\n\nserve and reach rural areas, a provision allowing the parties the flexibility to\n\nnegotiate rental based on an equitable formula would allow the parties to account\n\nfor changes in cost, market, and other factors that would affect their own\n\nexpenses while still working toward an equitable sharing of costs.\n\n      Verizon contends that language included with the asterisk in the table of\n\nAppendix B of the Southwestern States contract trumps all of the remaining\n\nlanguage in Appendix B. That language, appended to the last and highest rental\n\namount in the table, states that “[i]f average costs are substantially higher than\n\nthis value, appropriate rentals should be determined by agreement.”             Thus,\n\nVerizon contends that because all of the rental amounts listed in the JUA, as\n\n\n                                         37\n\famended––which were presumably tabulated according to the formula in\n\nAppendix B––are substantially lower than the current average costs as tabulated\n\naccording to the formula in Appendix B, this appended statement nullifies the\n\nformula in Appendix B altogether as to future periodic adjustment of rentals and\n\nthat such adjustments are only bound by what the parties can mutually agree to.\n\n      The table in Appendix B shows what the parties had agreed to be––in\n\naccordance with Appendix B––“the average cost of a typical mile of 35 foot, class\n\n6 poles in place in their common area . . . over a range of typical mile costs.”\n\nTherefore, the addition of the language next to the double asterisk at the end of\n\nthe table simply reflected that once the average cost of a typical mile of 35 foot,\n\nclass 6 poles in place in their common area exceeded the last agreed-upon\n\namount in the table, the parties would again have to agree on a new average\n\ncost per typical mile, taking into account the factors set forth in Appendix B, such\n\nas “right-of-way solicitation, clearing, staking, direct labor and material costs of\n\nbare poles in place and pro rata shares of construction supervision and\n\noverhead.” Because such a calculation involves numerous factors, and takes\n\ninto account costs incurred by both of the parties to the JUA––which presumably\n\nwould differ as to each of them as well as fluctuate over time, it makes sense that\n\nthe JUA would require “agreement” as to an average cost. But that does not\n\nmean, in the context of the JUA as a whole, that the “agreement” is not required\n\nto be based on the factors set forth in Appendix B. Cf. Fischer v.

To construe the rental provision as Verizon urges would be to\n\nobviate the need for Appendix B altogether, and to say that rental would only be\n\nincreased upon mutual agreement of the parties––with no guiding principles as to\n\nthe purpose or reasonableness of their negotiations––would be no different than\n\nrequiring the rental to be frozen for the entire term of the JUA, thus allowing\n\nVerizon to unilaterally block any proposed increases.\n\n      We conclude that Tri-County’s interpretation of the rental provisions in the\n\nJUA is correct:    the parties have the flexibility to negotiate and agree on\n\n\n                                        39\n\fincreased rental; however, their agreement must be based on calculations\n\nperformed in accordance with Appendix B and nearest to the agreed upon\n\naverage cost. 10     Verizon’s argument that Tri-County breached by demanding\n\nrental more often than every five years presumes that the JUA applies to the\n\nholdover term; 11 because we have determined that there is a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether the JUA applied to the holdover term, we likewise\n\nhold that a fact issue exists as to this ground of Verizon’s summary judgment\n\nmotion as well. 12\n\n      Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment\n\nfor Verizon on this part of Tri-County’s breach of contract claim.

Inventory\n\n      Verizon also moved for summary judgment on Tri-County’s claim that\n\nVerizon is responsible for the costs of the inventory because its breach of the\n\nJUA by underreporting pole attachments necessitated the inventory. According\n\nto Verizon, no provision of the JUA requires it to finance the inventory, and the\n\nundisputed facts show that it did not cause the need for the inventory.\n\n      Article IV requires a party to request permission from the other party in\n\nwriting before making any attachments to a joint use pole or before changing the\n\ncharacter of its circuits on a joint use pole. It also gives the owner the right to\n\nreject such an application. Moore’s affidavit indicates that Tri-County became\n\naware in late 2009 or early 2010 that Verizon had not been submitting requests\n\nfor pole attachments, which he thought was unusual based on his experience in\n\nthe industry. The subsequent inventory revealed substantially more attachments\n\nthan had been agreed upon by the parties in the JUA as amended.\n\n      Generally, the measure of damages for breach of a contract is that which\n\nrestores the injured party to the economic position he would have enjoyed if the\n\ncontract had been performed, which may include consequential damages.

The JUA requires each party to notify the other\n\nbefore making new or additional attachments and before making changes to\n\ncircuit loading. Tri-County presented evidence that as of late 2009 or early 2010,\n\nTri-County became aware that, unusually, Verizon had not been submitting\n\nrequests for new attachments for “years.” Because the very nature of the JUA is\n\na sharing of costs in order to provide services and because rental is based on\n\npole count, such underreporting would naturally result in the need for some party\n\nto engage in a count of the poles. Whether the inventory that was performed is\n\naccurate or whether the consultant’s charges and scope were reasonable is not\n\nrelevant to whether the type of damage is foreseeable.\n\n      We conclude and hold that the trial court erred by granting summary\n\njudgment for Verizon on this ground.\n\n\n\n\n                                       42\n\f            c. Other Breach of Contract Claims\n\n      Verizon also moved for summary judgment on various theories on other\n\nparts of Tri-County’s breach of contract claims.\n\n      First, Verizon contended that it was entitled to summary judgment on Tri-\n\nCounty’s breach of contract claim for Verizon’s alleged failure “to provide\n\ninformation in accordance with the requirements of Appendix B.” Verizon argues\n\nthat Appendix B does not require the exchange of information, that if it does, Tri-\n\nCounty itself did not provide information to Verizon, and that Tri-County was not\n\ndamaged by the failure because it revoked the request after receiving public\n\nrecords with that information and because it did not use the information in making\n\nits new rate demand.\n\n      Although the JUA never expressly states that either party must provide\n\ncost information to the other, as we have stated, one of the overriding purposes\n\nof the JUA is the equitable sharing of costs; that purpose can be seen in the\n\nrental provisions as well as the provisions regarding the erection of new poles\n\nand the abandonment of poles.        While it is understandable that in today’s\n\ncompetitive market of telecommunications, companies negotiating contracts\n\naffecting the cost of providing services are not as willing to share information in\n\nsuch a way that it would affect their bargaining power, the purpose and spirit of\n\nthe JUA––which was entered into during a very different environment regarding\n\ntelecommunications––is that the parties will cooperate in the joint provision of\n\nservices in a way that comes as close as possible to equalizing their expenses\n\n\n                                        43\n\fso as to provide services to the maximum number of users possible.

(“Since the lessor is obligated to propose a rate consistent with the factors\n\nenumerated, it must make that determination in good faith, and if it fails to act in\n\ngood faith or fails to propose any rate at all, as it did in the present case, it may\n\nbe deemed to have waived its right to propose the rate and thus to leave the\n\nmatter for the court’s determination.”).\n\n      With regard to Verizon’s waiver arguments, Tri-County points to evidence\n\nthat it did provide an example of its costs to Verizon with an invoice dated\n\nJanuary 24, 2012. That information is titled, “Tri-County – 2010 Appendix B\n\nCalculation – current w/ Initial Clearing and Adders.” Additionally, it points to\n\nMoore’s summary judgment affidavit, which states that although Tri-County\n\nobtained historical data from the FCC, its consultants later informed it that the\n\nrental calculation would be higher using the more current data. According to\n\nMoore, Tri-County nevertheless “made the decision to demand that Verizon pay\n\nonly” the rate based on the historical data “even though our consultants at RASR\n\n\n                                           44\n\fadvised us that we were in fact entitled to a higher rate for 2005-07 rental years,\n\nbecause it was the rate that we had demanded for those rental years from the\n\nbeginning.” Waiver is ordinarily a fact issue; the record shows that Tri-County\n\nattempted to negotiate new rental rates and a new JUA with Verizon even after\n\nthe termination date. See In re Lennar Homes of Tex. Sales & Mktg., Ltd.,\n\nNo. 02-15-00174-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4366046</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (Tex.

Thus, we conclude that the record shows at\n\nleast a fact issue as to whether Tri-County abandoned its request for the correct,\n\ncurrent information regarding Verizon’s pole costs. For the same reason, we\n\nhold that there is a fact issue as to the damages element of this claim.\n\n      Second, Verizon contends that Tri-County “has never identified a single\n\nattachment that Verizon . . . made to a [Tri-County] pole without permission\n\nfollowing termination,” which we construe to be a no-evidence ground. However,\n\nTri-County provided evidence that the total number of attachments found in the\n\nthird-party inventory well exceeds the total number of attachments agreed upon\n\nby the parties in the JUA as amended. We hold that––combined with Moore’s\n\naffidavit testimony that Verizon had gone for an unusual amount of time without\n\nseeking permission for new attachments under the JUA––this is enough to raise\n\na fact issue as to whether Verizon made new attachments to Tri-County’s joint\n\nuse poles without first seeking permission as set forth in the JUA.

Because we have\n\nalready concluded that at least a fact issue exists as to whether Verizon\n\nbreached the JUA by failing to give the requested information, we also hold that\n\nthere is a fact issue on this facet of the breach of contract claim.\n\n      For these reasons, we conclude and hold that the trial court erred by\n\ngranting Verizon summary judgment on Tri-County’s breach of contract claims.\n\n      4. Declaratory Judgment, Attorney’s Fees, and Exemplary Damages\n\n      Verizon moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims in Tri-\n\nCounty’s petition generally because they are dependent on Tri-County’s ability to\n\nrecover on the breach of contract or trespass claims, which Verizon contended\n\nall fail. Because we have held that the trial court erred by granting summary\n\njudgment for Verizon on those claims, we likewise conclude that the trial court\n\nerred by granting summary judgment on the remaining claims on the ground that\n\nthey are dependent on the breach of contract and trespass claims. Moreover,\n\nbecause the declaratory judgment claim must be remanded, Verizon is not\n\nentitled to summary judgment as to attorney’s fees based on its argument that\n\nTri-County cannot recover fees because they are not available in connection with\n\nthe breach of contract and trespass claims.\n\n\n                                         46\n\f      But Verizon did independently challenge the exemplary damages claim on\n\nthe ground that Tri-County “has not pointed to any evidence, let alone ‘clear and\n\nconvincing evidence’ that [its] trespass damages ‘resulted from fraud, malice, or\n\ngross negligence’ as required to obtain such damages” under civil practice and\n\nremedies code section 41.003(a). Tri-County relies on this court’s opinion in\n\nWilen v. Falkenstein to show that a trespass can be malicious and that it has\n\nalleged similar behavior by Verizon in intentionally occupying its poles without\n\npaying any rent and in refusing to negotiate a new rental amount in accordance\n\nwith Appendix B of the JUA. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1439490\"><a href=\"/opinion/1439490/wilen-v-falkenstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800–01 (Tex.

This evidence could conceivably support\n\nan inference that Verizon intentionally stopped seeking permission for new\n\nattachments under the JUA to enhance its bargaining power in negotiating a new\n\nrental rate and, after termination of the JUA, that it held over for the same\n\npurpose.   However, the evidence also shows that (1) Tri-County’s actions\n\nregarding Verizon’s holdover were not consistent as to whether it was treating\n\nVerizon as a tenant at will subject to the JUA or as a trespasser, (2) that Verizon\n\ndisputed the applicability of the Appendix B formula, (3) that Verizon engaged in\n\nnegotiation discussions with Tri-County around the termination date, (4) that\n\nVerizon tendered payment that Tri-County rejected, and (5) that Verizon\n\nattachments may have been miscounted in the third party inventory.

Campbell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2547615\"><a href=\"/opinion/2547615/leake-v-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190 (Tex. App.––Fort Worth\n\n2011, no pet.).\n\n                                      V.     Conclusion\n\n      Having sustained Tri-County’s first issue in part, we reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment for Verizon except as to Tri-County’s exemplary damages claim only.\n\nWe affirm the trial court’s summary judgment for Verizon on Tri-County’s\n\nexemplary damages claim. We reverse the trial court’s denial of Tri-County’s\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment in part and render an order that (a) after\n\ntermination, Verizon became a holdover tenant and (b) Tri-County had the right\n\nto demand removal of Verizon’s attachments to its joint use poles as of the\n\ntermination date. We affirm the trial court’s denial of Tri-County’s motion for\n\npartial summary judgment in all other respects. Having reversed the majority of\n\nthe trial court’s judgment for Verizon, we remand the case for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                          /s/ Terrie Livingston\n                                                          TERRIE LIVINGSTON\n                                                          CHIEF JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: LIVINGSTON, C.J.; GARDNER and MEIER, JJ.\n\nDELIVERED: February 11, 2016\n\n                                               50\n\f</pre>",
