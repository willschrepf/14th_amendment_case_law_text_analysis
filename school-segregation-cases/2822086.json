Our enduring national devotion to\r<br><br>          freedom of expression, embodied in the First Amendment and renewed\r<br><br>          in \r            New York Times Co.\r                               v. \r                                  Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), inevitably\r<br><br>          means that much offensive and inaccurate speech will remain free\r<br><br>          from legal constraints. Still, there are boundaries past which\r<br><br>          speakers cannot trespass. This case illustrates how difficult it\r<br><br>          is to trace those boundaries with the precision that the law\r<br><br>          demands.\r<br><br>          I. STORE WARS\r<br><br>                    The events that gave rise to this litigation are\r<br><br>          controversial but, for the most part, not controverted. We present\r<br><br>          a balanced synopsis here.\r<br><br>                    The plaintiff, Levinsky's, Inc. (Levinsky's), is a\r<br><br>          family-owned business that operates three retail clothing stores in\r<br><br>          Maine. It has deep roots in the community. The defendant, Wal-\r<br><br>          Mart Stores, Inc. (Wal-Mart), is the nation's largest retailer. It\r<br><br>          is a relative newcomer to the Maine marketplace. The two compete\r<br><br>          head to head in the Portland area.\r<br><br>                    In the fall of 1994, Levinsky's decided to run a tongue-\r<br><br>          in-cheek radio advertisement that forged a comparison between it\r<br><br>          and Wal-Mart. A snippet from the ad reflects its tone:\r<br><br>          \"Levinsky's has a great selection and the lowest prices in Maine on\r<br><br>          Levi's jeans, Dockers and denim shirts. Wal-Mart doesn't carry\r<br><br>          Levi's, but we did get a good buy on a toaster.\" The spot aired in\r<br><br>          the Portland area for about six weeks during the pre-Christmas\r<br><br>          shopping season.\r<br><br><br>                                          2\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>                    Intrigued by the unorthodox advertising campaign, Michael\r<br><br>          Boardman, a free-lance writer for the Portland business magazine\r<br><br>          Biz, decided to write a \"David versus Goliath\" story about\r<br><br>          Levinsky's aggressive reaction to Wal-Mart's entry into the\r<br><br>          marketplace. The article appeared in  Biz's January/February 1995\r<br><br>          issue under the headline \"Levinsky's: Leaner and meaner with\r<br><br>          retail competition.\" In the text, Boardman compared Levinsky's to\r<br><br>          a \"feisty kid who fights the school bully for his lunch money.\"\r<br><br>                    While researching the story, Boardman telephoned Gilbert\r<br><br>          Olson, the manager of Wal-Mart's store in Scarborough, Maine (a\r<br><br>          Portland suburb). Olson testified that he thought Boardman was a\r<br><br>          college student researching a paper, but Boardman maintained that\r<br><br>          he clearly identified himself as a journalist and stated the\r<br><br>          purpose of his call. At any rate, Olson made two statements during\r<br><br>          his conversation with Boardman that lie at the epicenter of this\r<br><br>          appeal. First, he described a Levinsky's store as \"trashy.\"\r<br><br>          Second, he stated that when a person called Levinsky's, \"you are\r<br><br>          sometimes put on hold for 20 minutes _ or the phone is never picked\r<br><br>          up at all.\"  Biz printed these (and other) remarks, attributing\r<br><br>          them to Wal-Mart.\r<br><br>                    Shortly thereafter, Levinsky's and several family members\r<br><br>          sued Wal-Mart for defamation, injurious falsehood, false light,\r<br><br>          deceptive trade practices, interference with advantageous economic\r<br><br>          relations, and infliction of emotional distress. Their complaint,\r<br><br>          filed in the federal district court under diversity jurisdiction,\r<br><br>          28 U.S.C. S 1332(a) (1994), sought $40,000,000 in compensatory and\r<br><br><br>                                          3\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          presumed damages, plus punitive damages equal to 2% of Wal-Mart's\r<br><br>          net worth. Most of these claims were weeded out before or during\r<br><br>          trial. The defamation claims survived. The jury found that the\r<br><br>          individual family members had not been defamed, but awarded\r<br><br>          Levinsky's $600,000 for presumed damages to reputation\r<br><br>          (notwithstanding the lack of any specific evidence of actual\r<br><br>          pecuniary loss). The jury also determined that Olson had not acted\r<br><br>          with ill will and declined to award Levinsky's exemplary damages.\r<br><br>                    The district judge upheld the verdict and made several\r<br><br>          rulings that bear on this appeal. First, the judge found that the\r<br><br>          verdict did not offend the First Amendment because both the word\r<br><br>          \"trashy\" and the \"20 minutes on hold\" comments stated opinions that\r<br><br>          implied provably false facts. Second, because Olson's statements\r<br><br>          related to Levinsky's business, the judge concluded that presumed\r<br><br>          damages were available. Third, emphasizing Olson's subjective\r<br><br>          belief that he was not speaking to a reporter but to a university\r<br><br>          student, the judge determined that Olson's comments did not relate\r<br><br>          to a matter of public concern, and that, therefore, Levinsky's did\r<br><br>          not need to show actual malice as a precondition to the award of\r<br><br>          presumed damages. Fourth, the judge ruled that, under Maine's\r<br><br>          defamation per se doctrine, a finding of defamation that related to\r<br><br>          the plaintiff's business established legally sufficient fault and\r<br><br><br>                              \r<br><br>               Among other things, the district court ruled that other\r<br>          statements which Olson had uttered were not actionable and\r<br>          pretermitted various causes of action. These matters are not\r<br>          within the compass of this appeal and we make no further mention of\r<br>          them.\r<br><br>                                          4\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          thus obviated any need for a jury instruction on negligence.\r<br><br>          II. A SHOPPING LIST\r<br><br>                    This appeal offers a large inventory of interleaved legal\r<br><br>          issues. We pick our way through that inventory by traversing the\r<br><br>          intersection of the First Amendment and state defamation law as it\r<br><br>          has developed over time, noting, inter alia, a restriction on the\r<br><br>          scope of defamation imposed by Maine law. We next discuss one of\r<br><br>          the two allegedly defamatory statements _ the \"trashy\" reference _\r<br><br>          and conclude, as a matter of federal constitutional law, that it\r<br><br>          cannot support a recovery. We then address the second statement _\r<br><br>          \"20 minutes on hold\" _ and conclude that it is actionable. We move\r<br><br>          at that point to the matter of public concern (but do not resolve\r<br><br>          it). Finally, because a new trial is required, we offer some\r<br><br>          guidance to the district court in connection with the role of\r<br><br>          negligence in Maine defamation cases.\r<br><br>          III. STAPLES: THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND STATE DEFAMATION LAW\r<br><br>                    For many years, states enacted statutes and applied\r<br><br>          common law tort principles in the area of defamation with no more\r<br><br>          than a passing nod to the First Amendment's free speech guaranty.\r<br><br>          This era of constitutional non-interference ended when the Justices\r<br><br>          proclaimed \"a profound national commitment to the principle that\r<br><br>          debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-\r<br><br>          open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes\r<br><br>          unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\"\r<br><br>          New York Times\r                       , 376 U.S. at 270. Faithful to this ideal, the Court\r<br><br>          announced that the First Amendment precludes recovery by a public\r<br><br><br>                                          5\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          official under state defamation law unless the official shows that\r<br><br>          the speaker acted with actual malice, that is, with knowledge of or\r<br><br>          reckless disregard for the falsity of the statement.  See id. at\r<br><br>          279-80.\r<br><br>                    The seeds sown in \r                                     New York Times\r                                                    have blossomed over the\r<br><br>          years, giving rise to a crop of checks on the sweep of state\r<br><br>          defamation law. We harvest four points.\r<br><br>                          A.  Independent Appellate Review.\r<br><br>                    First, the deference traditionally shown by courts toward\r<br><br>          factfinders' determinations is muted when defamation issues\r<br><br>          implicate free speech concerns. In such circumstances, appellate\r<br><br>          judges must conduct a whole-record review and \"examine for\r<br><br>          [them]selves the statements in issue and the circumstances under\r<br><br>          which they were made to see . . . whether they are of a character\r<br><br>          which the principles of the First Amendment\" protect.  Id. at 285\r<br><br>          (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This requirement\r<br><br>          of independent appellate review is not a procedural directive, but,\r<br><br>          rather, \"a rule of federal constitutional law\" that \"reflects a\r<br><br>          deeply held conviction that judges . . . must exercise such review\r<br><br>          in order to preserve the precious liberties established and\r<br><br>          ordained by the Constitution.\"  Bose \r                                               Corp. v. Consumers \r                                                                  Union \r                                                                         of\r<br><br>          United States, Inc.\r                            , 466 U.S. 485, 510-11 (1984). Indeed, when the\r<br><br>          imperative of independent review conflicts with a standard\r<br><br>          procedural dictate (such as Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)), the\r<br><br>          constitutional mandate controls.  See id. at 514.\r<br><br>                    As a practical matter, this requirement means that\r<br><br><br>                                          6\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          federal courts engage in de novo review when mulling defamation\r<br><br>          issues that are tinged with constitutional implications.     See,\r<br><br>          e.g., \r               id. at 511, 514; \r                                Connick v. \r                                          Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 147-48 &amp; n.7\r<br><br>          (1983); \r                 Phantom Touring, Inc.\r                                       v. \r                                          Affiliated Publications\r                                                                 , 953 F.2d\r<br><br>          724, 727 (1st Cir. 1992); \r                                   Kassel v. \r                                             Gannett Co.\r                                                        , 875 F.2d 935, 937\r<br><br>          (1st Cir. 1989). Maine courts follow the same course. See \r                                                                    Rippett\r<br><br>          v. Bemis, 672 A.2d 82, 86 (Me. 1996); Caron v. Bangor Publ'g Co.,\r<br><br>          470 A.2d 782, 784 (Me. 1984).\r<br><br>                           B.  Opinions May Be Actionable.\r<br><br>                    The First Amendment does not inoculate all opinions\r<br><br>          against the ravages of defamation suits. A statement couched as an\r<br><br>          opinion that presents or implies the existence of facts which are\r<br><br>          capable of being proven true or false can be actionable.

Thus, the First Amendment prohibits defamation actions\r<br><br>          based on loose, figurative language that no reasonable person would\r<br><br>          believe presented facts.

By contrast, if the\r<br>          speaker says, \"In my opinion Mayor Jones shows his abysmal\r<br>          ignorance by accepting the teachings of Marx and Lenin,\" the First\r<br>          Amendment bars recovery because the statement cannot be objectively\r<br>          verified.

For better or\r<br><br>          worse, our society has long since passed the stage at which the use\r<br><br>          of the word \"bastard\" would occasion an investigation into the\r<br><br>          target's lineage or the cry \"you pig\" would prompt a probe for a\r<br><br>          porcine pedigree. Hyperbole is very much the coin of the modern\r<br><br>          realm. In extending full constitutional protection to this\r<br><br>          category of speech, the  Milkovich Court recognized the need to\r<br><br>          segregate casually used words, no matter how tastelessly couched,\r<br><br>          from fact-based accusations.\r<br><br>                     C.  Actual Malice Sometimes Must Be Shown.\r<br><br>                    The Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment not\r<br><br>          only restricts the types of actionable statements, but also limits\r<br><br>          the kinds of recoverable damages. Of particular relevance here is\r<br><br>          the Court's holding that a private individual who seeks damages for\r<br><br>          a defamatory statement involving a matter of public concern cannot\r<br><br>          recover presumed or punitive damages absent a showing of actual\r<br><br>          malice.

Determining whether an allegedly defamatory\r<br><br>          statement involves a matter of public concern requires a court to\r<br><br>          assess the statement's \"content, form and context . . . as revealed\r<br><br>          by the whole record.\"  Dun &amp; Bradstreet, 472 U.S. at 761 (quoting\r<br><br>          Connick, 461 U.S. at 147-48).

Fault Always Must Be Shown.\r<br><br>                    The fourth principle that must be understood before we\r<br><br>          embark on our odyssey through the record is a restriction on\r<br><br>          defamation that Maine's jurisprudence hallows, though its\r<br><br>          constitutional credentials remain inscrutable. Simply put, Maine\r<br><br>          defamation law does not recognize liability without fault; rather,\r<br><br>          as a predicate to recovery, Maine requires a defamation plaintiff\r<br><br>          to show that the defendant acted at least negligently. See \r                                                                     Lester\r<br><br>          v. Powers, 596 A.2d 65, 69 (Me. 1991).\r<br><br>          IV. THE NATURE OF THE STATEMENTS\r<br><br>                    The two statements that the district court permitted the\r<br><br>          jury to consider are not in legal equipoise. Hence, we discuss\r<br><br>          them separately.\r<br><br>                                 A.  Talking Trash.\r<br><br>                    The district court ruled that the adjective \"trashy\"\r<br><br>          stated an opinion that implied a provably false fact and was,\r<br><br>          therefore, actionable. This ruling rested on the court's expressed\r<br><br>          view that the term had a single, readily ascertainable meaning _\r<br><br><br>                              \r<br><br>               It is unclear whether the First Amendment prohibits a state\r<br>          from imposing strict liability in a defamation case brought by a\r<br>          private plaintiff concerning statements that implicate a matter of\r<br>          private concern.  See Snead v. Redland Aggregates, Ltd., 998 F.2d\r<br>          1325, 1334 (5th Cir. 1993) (discussing the question and concluding\r<br>          that the First Amendment \"imposes no minimum standard of fault in\r<br>          private/private libel cases\"). Because Maine has articulated a\r<br>          minimum negligence standard for all defamation actions, we need not\r<br>          ponder the constitutional issue here.\r<br><br>                                         10\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          \"dirty or unkempt\" _ and that, in Judge Carter's words, Olson's\r<br><br>          statement could be \"verified or disproved through straightforward\r<br><br>          inquiry into the condition of [Levinsky's] store's physical\r<br><br>          appearance.\" We do not agree.\r<br><br>                    Despite avowals that all speech is infinitely malleable,\r<br><br>          see, e.g., Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass, ch. 6 (1872)\r<br><br>          (reporting Humpty Dumpty's declaration: \"When I use a word, it\r<br><br>          means just what I choose it to mean _ neither more nor less.\"), the\r<br><br>          First Amendment does not allow courts the luxury of a\r<br><br>          deconstructionist approach to language. Some words or phrases\r<br><br>          evoke a multiplicity of meanings; others do not. Under the aegis\r<br><br>          of the First Amendment, a particular word or phrase ordinarily\r<br><br>          cannot be defamatory unless in a given context it reasonably can be\r<br><br>          understood as having an easily ascertainable and objectively\r<br><br>          verifiable meaning. The vaguer a term, or the more meanings it\r<br><br>          reasonably can convey, the less likely it is to be actionable.\r<br><br>          See, \r              e.g., \r                    Phantom Touring\r                                   , 953 F.2d at 728 (holding that newspaper\r<br><br>          articles that referred to the plaintiff's production of \"The\r<br><br>          Phantom of the Opera\" as \"fake\" and \"phony\" were not actionable\r<br><br>          because the descriptions were \"unprovable,\" inasmuch as \"those\r<br><br>          adjectives admit of numerous interpretations\"); \r                                                        McCabe v. \r                                                                  Rattiner,\r<br><br>          814 F.2d 839, 842-43 (1st Cir. 1987) (holding that a newspaper\r<br><br>          headline which referred to the plaintiff's real estate development\r<br><br>          as a \"scam\" was not actionable because the word means different\r<br><br>          things to different people and \"[t]he lack of precision makes the\r<br><br>          assertion `X is a scam' incapable of being proven true of false\").\r<br><br><br>                                         11\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>                    It is against this mise-en-scene that we must explore the\r<br><br>          meaning of the word \"trashy.\" We start, as we often do in\r<br><br>          searching out the meaning of a word, with the dictionary.\r<br><br>          Lexicographic sources do not reflect any specific meaning of the\r<br><br>          word.

Louis Bromfield showed\r<br><br>          a more traditionalist bent, favoring the classic \"covered with\r<br><br>          withered growth\" meaning of the word when he wrote of a seedbed\r<br><br>          that \"was rough and trashy.\" Louis Bromfield, Pleasant Valley 174\r<br><br>          (1945). While these four illustrations merely scratch the surface,\r<br><br>          they amply demonstrate the term's definitional flexibility.\r<br><br>                    The usages paraded through the courtroom by Levinsky's\r<br><br>          able counsel reinforce this point. Particularly revelatory are his\r<br><br>          opening and closing statements, in which he seemed frankly to\r<br><br>          acknowledge the word's many connotations. At various times,\r<br><br>          counsel suggested to the jury that Olson's statement referred to\r<br><br>          the manner in which the plaintiff maintained its stores (in this\r<br><br>          context meaning \"filthy\" and \"dirty\"), to the merchandise that the\r<br><br>          plaintiff purveyed (in this context meaning \"inferior\" and\r<br><br>          \"crappy\"), and to the character of the persons associated with the\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                         13\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          enterprise (in this context meaning \"sleazy\" and \"untrustworthy\").\r<br><br>          This broadcast acknowledgement that the word \"trashy\" possesses a\r<br><br>          multitude of fairly ascribable meanings is in itself telling.\r<br><br>                    In this instance, moreover, the inherent elusiveness of\r<br><br>          \"trashy\" is not pinned down by context. Indeed, the imprecision of\r<br><br>          the word is accentuated by the testimony of the journalist,\r<br><br>          Boardman, who, when asked his understanding of \"trashy\" as Olson\r<br><br>          had voiced it, responded, \"It's always been hard for me to define\r<br><br>          exactly what he was referring to.\" In the same vein, Boardman\r<br><br>          reported that Olson's only amplification of the remark was that\r<br><br>          \"customers should pay a little more money to buy the same item they\r<br><br>          want somewhere else.\" Like \"trashy\" itself, this comment presents\r<br><br>          a moving target.\r<br><br>                    The polysemous nature of the word \"trashy\" dooms\r<br><br>          Levinsky's effort to recover for Olson's use of it. The word\r<br><br>          \"trashy\" is a chameleon that continuously changes colors and shades\r<br><br>          of meaning. It admits of numerous interpretations. We can imagine\r<br><br>          no objective evidence that might conclusively prove or disprove it.\r<br><br>          Like the equally pejorative terms used in \r                                                   Phantom Touring\r                                                                   (\"fake,\"\r<br><br>          \"phony,\" \"rip-off\"), McCabe (\"scam\"), and Dilworth v. Dudley, 75\r<br><br>                              \r<br><br>               These iterations, including the adjectives quoted in the\r<br>          parenthetical inserts, appear at pages 22-23 (opening statement)\r<br>          and 273-274 (closing statement) of the trial transcript.\r<br><br>               Following the district court's lead, Levinsky's counsel now\r<br>          seeks to define \"trashy\" solely with reference to lack of\r<br>          cleanliness. We give this tergiversation short shrift. Those who\r<br>          sue for defamation are not at liberty to pick and choose among a\r<br>          word's various possible definitions and saddle the speaker with the\r<br>          consequences.\r<br><br>                                         14\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          F.3d 307, 310-11 (7th Cir. 1996) (allowing no defamation remedy\r<br><br>          when one scholar calls another a \"crank\"), \"trashy\" is\r<br><br>          quintessentially subjective.\r<br><br>                    To say more about this point would be supererogatory.\r<br><br>          Branding a store, its merchandise, its customers, or its\r<br><br>          proprietors as \"trashy\" is uncomplimentary, and it may be\r<br><br>          unwarranted; in the last analysis, however, such a comment is loose\r<br><br>          language that cannot be objectively verified. Consequently, it\r<br><br>          belongs squarely in the category of protected opinion. It follows\r<br><br>          inexorably that Levinsky's reliance on this unflattering adjective\r<br><br>          to underpin a defamation claim offends the First Amendment.   See\r<br><br>          Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 20-21;  Washington v. Smith, 80 F.3d 555,\r<br><br>          556-57 (D.C.

Penthouse \r                                                          Int'l, \r                                                                 Ltd., 840\r<br><br>          F.2d 1012, 1016 (1st Cir. 1988).\r<br><br>                                    B.  On Hold.\r<br><br>                    The district court likewise ruled that Olson's second\r<br><br>          statement (when calling Levinsky's, \"you are sometimes put on hold\r<br><br>          for 20 minutes _ or the phone is never picked up at all\")\r<br><br>          encompassed matters of fact (or opinions that implied provably\r<br><br>          false facts) and was, therefore, actionable. Wal-Mart takes\r<br><br>          exception to this ruling. Its principal argument is that\r<br><br>          constitutional shelter for this statement can be found in the First\r<br><br>          Amendment protections typically afforded figurative language and\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                         15\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          hyperbole. We think not.\r<br><br>                    Certain excesses of language cannot ground a defamation\r<br><br>          claim because, in context, those excesses involve only puffery or\r<br><br>          epithets, and thus are insufficiently fact-based.     See,  e.g.,\r<br><br>          Austin, 418 U.S. at 284-86 (\"traitor\"); \r                                                 Bresler, 398 U.S. at 13-14\r<br><br>          (\"blackmail\"). These turns of phrase are recognized rhetorical\r<br><br>          devices; they are not actionable because they are commonly\r<br><br>          understood, in context, as imaginative expressions rather than\r<br><br>          statements of fact.\r<br><br>                    Paddling furiously to reach this safe harbor, the\r<br><br>          appellant urges us to interpret Olson's comment as an obvious\r<br><br>          exaggeration, tantamount to the statement \"you are sometimes put on\r<br><br>          hold forever.\" No reasonable listener, the appellant asseverates,\r<br><br>          would consider this variant an assertion of literal truth. But the\r<br><br>          appellant's argument requires a leap of faith that we are unwilling\r<br><br>          to essay. The First Amendment does not allow courts to distort the\r<br><br>          reality of events under the guise of protecting freedom of\r<br><br>          expression. Thus, a reviewing court must evaluate a speaker's\r<br><br>          statement as it was given and must resist the temptation to replace\r<br><br>          what was actually said with some more innocuous alternative.\r<br><br>                    The determination of whether a statement is hyperbole\r<br><br>                              \r<br><br>               Wal-Mart's other arguments on this point can be dismissed out\r<br>          of hand. In this wise, we note that the record contains no\r<br>          evidence from which a jury supportably could find that this comment\r<br>          was literally true. At trial, Olson testified that on three\r<br>          separate occasions he had called Levinsky's and had been put on\r<br>          hold for \r                   a \r                     total \r                            of \r                               20 \r                                  minutes \r                                           or \r                                              more (but no longer than 10\r<br>          minutes on any one occasion). The appellant adduced no other\r<br>          evidence suggesting that Olson's statement was accurate.\r<br><br>                                         16\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          depends primarily upon whether a reasonable person could interpret\r<br><br>          the statement to provide actual facts about the individual or\r<br><br>          institution it describes.   See  Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 20;   cf.\r<br><br>          Hustler  \r                  Magazine,  \r                             Inc. v.   Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 50 (1988)\r<br><br>          (precluding recovery on the ground that an advertising parody,\r<br><br>          which claimed that a minister had lost his virginity in a drunken\r<br><br>          rendezvous with his mother, was incredible). Under this criterion,\r<br><br>          the \"20 minutes\" statement seems sufficiently factual to be proved\r<br><br>          true or false. For one thing, Olson's use of a specific time frame\r<br><br>          cuts against treating his remark as hyperbole or other non-factual\r<br><br>          speech. For another thing, the assertion can be verified or\r<br><br>          rebutted by objective evidence of how Levinsky's staff handled\r<br><br>          telephone calls (evidence of the type that, in fact, Levinsky's\r<br><br>          adduced and the jury heard). In addition, the statement is not\r<br><br>          inherently implausible. Especially given the pervasive folklore\r<br><br>          concerning the difficulties that consumers encounter in dealing\r<br><br>          with merchants telephonically, we believe that a reasonable\r<br><br>          listener could interpret the \"20 minutes\" comment as a statement of\r<br><br>          fact about Levinsky's business practices.\r<br><br>                    As the appellant correctly notes, we cannot take the \"20\r<br><br>          minutes\" remark in isolation. Seizing this potential lifeline,\r<br><br>          Wal-Mart struggles to persuade us that the second part of Olson's\r<br><br>          statement _ \"the phone is never picked up at all\" _ colors the\r<br><br>          context and makes it plain that he was speaking figuratively.\r<br><br>          Though context is an important aspect of the \r                                                     Milkovich inquiry, \r                                                                        see\r<br><br>          Phantom \r                  Touring, 953 F.2d at 727; McCabe, 814 F.2d at 842-43, it\r<br><br><br>                                         17\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          does not aid the appellant here. While the second portion of\r<br><br>          Olson's statement does not incorporate a fixed temporal interval,\r<br><br>          that remark, when read in tandem with the first portion of the\r<br><br>          statement, does not defuse the defamatory potential. A reasonable\r<br><br>          listener could well conclude that Levinsky's service was so bad\r<br><br>          that the company not only left customers dangling on the line for\r<br><br>          20 minutes at a crack, but also, on some occasions, simply did not\r<br><br>          bother to answer the telephone.\r<br><br>                    In fine, the overall context does little to dispel the\r<br><br>          impression that Olson's comment stated facts about Levinsky's\r<br><br>          business practices. After all, Levinsky's and Wal-Mart were locked\r<br><br>          in hand-to-hand combat for shoppers' dollars, and Olson held an\r<br><br>          executive position with Wal-Mart. While a reasonable listener\r<br><br>          might be skeptical given Olson's likely motive (to try to lure\r<br><br>          potential customers to his store), he gave his assertion a\r<br><br>          particularized factual component. A listener reasonably could\r<br><br>          conclude that Olson intended to describe from personal knowledge\r<br><br>          how Levinsky's treated callers.\r<br><br>                    The short of it is that neither the type of language\r<br><br>          employed nor the overall tenor of the article negated the\r<br><br>          reasonable impression that Olson steadfastly maintained that\r<br><br>          Levinsky's telephone practices were in fact as he described them to\r<br><br>                              \r<br><br>               Olson did not furnish Boardman, and Boardman did not print,\r<br>          any factual predicate for the assertions. This distinguishes them\r<br>          from certain comments discussed in  Phantom \r                                                      Touring, 953 F.2d at\r<br>          729, where context made it unmistakably clear that the challenged\r<br>          speech, though superficially capable of being proved true or false,\r<br>          represented only a point of view.\r<br><br>                                         18\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          be. On this basis, the \"20 minutes\" statement properly could be\r<br><br>          treated as fact-based defamation. So viewed, the statement does\r<br><br>          not fit within the contours of protected speech, and it was, as the\r<br><br>          lower court concluded, amenable to suit under the \r                                                          Milkovich regime.\r<br><br>          V. PUBLIC CONCERN\r<br><br>                    Even though the \"20 minutes\" statement is actionable, the\r<br><br>          appellant has another defense in stock. The jury awarded only\r<br><br>          presumed damages, and the Constitution forbids an award of presumed\r<br><br>          or punitive damages for words spoken without actual malice on\r<br><br>          matters of public concern.

A court must\r<br><br>          determine whether a statement comes within the public concern\r<br><br>          hemisphere of this formulation by reference to its \"content, form\r<br><br>          and context.\"  Dun &amp; Bradstreet, 472 U.S. at 761. In order to do\r<br><br>          so, the relevant community need not be very large and the relevant\r<br><br>          concern need not be of paramount importance or national scope.\r<br><br>                              \r<br><br>               Levinsky's assertion that Wal-Mart waived the right to raise\r<br>          the public concern issue is meritless. The opinions of the\r<br>          magistrate judge and the district judge in this case show beyond\r<br>          any peradventure of doubt that Wal-Mart consistently pressed the\r<br>          public concern argument in the proceedings below, and the trial\r<br>          transcript confirms that fact.\r<br><br>                                         19\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          Rather, \"it is sufficient that the speech concern matters in which\r<br><br>          even a relatively small segment of the general public might be\r<br><br>          interested.\" Roe v. \r                              City of San Francisco\r                                                   , 109 F.3d 578, 585 (9th\r<br><br>          Cir. 1997).\r<br><br>                    When called upon to perform a public concern analysis,\r<br><br>          courts have found the   Connick line of cases, i.e., judicial\r<br><br>          decisions involving public employees fired for making comments that\r<br><br>          arguably relate to matters of public concern, to be instructive.\r<br><br>          The Supreme Court has approved this analogy, \r                                                      see \r                                                          Dun &amp; Bradstreet\r                                                                          ,\r<br><br>          472 U.S. at 759, and we encourage its use. Still, jurists and\r<br><br>          lawyers alike should employ it with a caveat in mind. Public\r<br><br>          employee cases typically involve speech on matters relating to\r<br><br>          public sector jobs, and criticism of the workings of government is\r<br><br>          at the core of conduct protected by the First Amendment.  See New\r<br><br>          York \r               Times, 376 U.S. at 282-83, 292. Statements that implicate\r<br><br>          issues outside the public sector may require more rigorous\r<br><br>          analysis.\r<br><br>                    In this case, the appellant argues that the \"20 minutes\"\r<br><br>          statement related to a matter of public concern because       Biz\r<br><br>          published it in an article describing the \"David versus Goliath\"\r<br><br>          battle between Wal-Mart and a local, family-owned business. To\r<br><br>          bolster this argument, Wal-Mart points out that Boardman decided to\r<br><br>          write the piece because this type of business struggle had sparked\r<br><br>          intense interest across the country and because Levinsky's radio\r<br><br>          advertisements had called attention to a local microcosm of this\r<br><br>          struggle. Levinsky's counters by characterizing the comments as\r<br><br><br>                                         20\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          statements made in the course of a dispute between two private\r<br><br>          businesses. The mere fact that the competition between the two\r<br><br>          merchants interested a journalist, Levinsky's posits, does not make\r<br><br>          the matter one of public concern.\r<br><br>                    The district court decided this issue in Levinsky's\r<br><br>          favor, but based its decision entirely on Olson's testimony that he\r<br><br>          thought he was engaged in a private conversation with a college\r<br><br>          student. This prop is very shaky. Passing the probability that\r<br><br>          the prop is constructed from less than sturdy factual material _\r<br><br>          Olson's query to Boardman (\"You're not going to use my name, are\r<br><br>          you?\") suggests that at some point he did realize that Boardman\r<br><br>          would convey his comments to a wider audience _ we do not think\r<br><br>          that a speaker's subjective belief as to who will hear his\r<br><br>          statements should be the sole determinant of the constitutional\r<br><br>          question.\r<br><br>                    To be sure, we have recognized that in some circumstances\r<br><br>          a private statement might not qualify \"on the basis of its content\r<br><br>          alone, as a matter of inherent public concern,\" and that a court\r<br><br>          therefore may consider the speaker's \"subjective intent to\r<br><br>          contribute to any . . . public discourse.\"  O'Connor v.  Steeves,\r<br><br>          994 F.2d 905, 914 (1st Cir. 1993). Yet the Supreme Court has made\r<br><br>          it pellucid that the First Amendment protects comments privately\r<br><br>          expressed, \r                    see \r                        Givhan v. \r                                  Western Line Consol. Sch. Dist.\r                                                                 , 439 U.S.\r<br><br>          410, 415-16 (1979), and that private statements can touch on\r<br><br>          matters of public concern, see Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378,\r<br><br>          386 &amp; n.11 (1987). It is thus apparent that the speaker's intent\r<br><br><br>                                         21\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          is only one of a constellation of relevant factors implicated by a\r<br><br>          whole-record review of the speech's form, content, and context.\r<br><br>          See Connick, 461 U.S. at 147-48; O'Connor, 994 F.2d at 914 &amp; n.5.\r<br><br>          The primary focus of the relevant constitutional inquiry must\r<br><br>          remain on the speech's content and the public's perception of the\r<br><br>          topic, not on the speaker's subjective belief as to the\r<br><br>          conversation's confidentiality.\r<br><br>                    We are confronted, then, with a situation in which the\r<br><br>          lower court's resolution of the public concern issue is undermined\r<br><br>          by its incomplete assessment of the form, content, and context of\r<br><br>          Olson's statements. That sort of disconnect is invariably a\r<br><br>          problem for an appellate court. Here, however, the problem is\r<br><br>          exacerbated in two ways.\r<br><br>                    First, if we proceed on the record as it stands, we will\r<br><br>          be compelled to resolve an unsettled question as to what sources an\r<br><br>          appellate court may consult in attempting to ascertain whether a\r<br><br>          statement relates to a matter of public concern. Of course,\r<br><br>          certain things are clear. We know, for example, that Levinsky's\r<br><br>          decision to sue Wal-Mart does not retroactively confer public\r<br><br>          concern status on Olson's statements. To the contrary, media\r<br><br>          coverage of the lawsuit itself is irrelevant on this issue.   See\r<br><br>          Bruno \r                &amp; \r                  Stillman, \r                            Inc. v. Globe \r                                          Newspaper \r                                                    Co., 633 F.2d 583, 591\r<br><br>          (1st Cir. 1980); cf.  Hutchinson v. Proxmire, 443 U.S. 111, 135\r<br><br>          (1979) (\"[T]hose charged with defamation cannot, by their own\r<br><br>          conduct, create their own defense by making the claimant a public\r<br><br>          figure.\"). We know, too, that Levinsky's radio advertisements,\r<br><br><br>                                         22\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          Boardman's interest in the issue, and the \r                                                  Biz article, all of which\r<br><br>          are of record here, constitute relevant evidence that may help to\r<br><br>          determine public versus private concern by clarifying the context\r<br><br>          in which Olson spoke.  See Rankin, 483 U.S. at 381-86 (examining\r<br><br>          contextual evidence to determine whether a challenged statement\r<br><br>          dealt with a matter of public concern). But the record contains\r<br><br>          little else that bears on the public concern issue.\r<br><br>                    Equally as vexing, the appellant has asked us to take\r<br><br>          notice of a substantial body of information _ newspaper and\r<br><br>          magazine articles, excerpts from congressional hearings, and the\r<br><br>          like _ that could have been, but was not, presented below. It is\r<br><br>          uncertain whether we may honor the appellant's request,       see\r<br><br>          Matthews v. \r                     Marsh, 755 F.2d 182, 183 (1st Cir. 1985); \r                                                              United States\r<br><br>          v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 456 (1st Cir. 1983); Rosen v.  Lawson-\r<br><br>          Hemphill, \r                    Inc., 549 F.2d 205, 206 (1st Cir. 1976), and, if so,\r<br><br>          whether we should exercise that right.\r<br><br>                    The second complicating factor is that the public concern\r<br><br>          issue is intertwined with the question of actual malice. \r                                                                  See \r                                                                      supra\r<br><br>          Part III(C). Accordingly, even if the \"20 minutes\" statement\r<br><br>          involved a matter of public concern, an award of presumed damages\r<br><br>          would be constitutionally acceptable as long as the statement had\r<br><br>          been made with actual malice. In itself, this interrelation\r<br><br>          between public concern and actual malice is standard fare. Here,\r<br><br>          however, the district court did not resolve the actual malice\r<br><br>          question, either by submitting it to the jury or otherwise, because\r<br><br><br><br><br>                                         23\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          it had ruled against Wal-Mart on the public concern issue.\r<br><br>                    These complications counsel in favor of judicial\r<br><br>          restraint. Although we have the authority to resolve public\r<br><br>          concern issues ab initio at the appellate level, see Connick, 461\r<br><br>          U.S. at 147-48 &amp; n.7, we choose not to exercise that authority in\r<br><br>          this situation. We do not have the benefit of a reliable district\r<br><br>          court decision on the public concern issue; the record is very\r<br><br>          sparsely developed in regard to that issue; what evidence there is\r<br><br>          does not suggest a clear answer to whether or not Olson spoke on a\r<br><br>          matter of public concern; there is a substantial body of relevant\r<br><br>          evidence that was never presented below; and the existence \r                                                                    vel \r                                                                        non\r<br><br>          of actual malice remains problematic. Rather than groping for an\r<br><br>          answer to the question under the combined weight of these\r<br><br>          handicapping circumstances, we think that it would be fairest, all\r<br><br>          around, to remand and give the parties (not to mention the district\r<br><br>          court) a full opportunity to explore all aspects of this issue.\r<br><br>          See \r             Penobscot Indian Nation\r                                     v. \r                                        Key Bank\r                                                , 112 F.3d 538, 561-62 (1st\r<br><br>          Cir. 1997) (refusing to determine, as a matter of law, \"public\r<br><br>          figure\" status in a defamation action when presented with\r<br><br>          insufficient record evidence),   petition  \r                                                     for  \r                                                          cert.  \r                                                                 filed, 66\r<br><br>          U.S.L.W. 3130 (U.S. Aug. 4, 1997) (No. 97-219);       cf.  Icicle\r<br><br>          Seafoods, Inc. v. Worthington, 475 U.S. 709, 714 (1986).\r<br><br><br>                              \r<br><br>                To be sure, the jury did find specially that Olson spoke\r<br>          without common law malice (ill will or spite). Notwithstanding the\r<br>          similarity in nomenclature, however, common law malice and actual\r<br>          malice are not identical. See \r                                       Masson v. \r                                                 New Yorker Magazine, Inc.\r                                                                          ,\r<br>          501 U.S. 496, 510-11 (1991) (discussing the distinction).\r<br><br>                                         24\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          VI. NEGLIGENCE\r<br><br>                    Over Wal-Mart's objection, the court below submitted\r<br><br>          multiple defamation claims (\"trashy\" and \"20 minutes\") to the jury,\r<br><br>          which returned only a general verdict. That verdict may have been\r<br><br>          based, in whole or in part, on the improvidently submitted\r<br><br>          (\"trashy\") claim. Where such a contretemps occurs and a reviewing\r<br><br>          court cannot identify which of the two claims _ one proper and one\r<br><br>          improper _ the jury relied upon to reach the general verdict, the\r<br><br>          usual rule is that the verdict must be vacated.      See  Sunkist\r<br><br>          Growers, Inc. v. Winckler &amp; Smith Citrus Prods. Co., 370 U.S. 19,\r<br><br>          30 (1962); \r                    Lattimore v. \r                                 Polaroid Corp.\r                                               , 99 F.3d 456, 468 (1st Cir.\r<br><br>          1996). So it is here. Thus, we must remand for a new trial.\r<br><br>                    In other circumstances, this conclusion might end the\r<br><br>          appellate task. Here, however, the negligence issue persists:\r<br><br>          Wal-Mart assigns error to the district court's refusal to instruct\r<br><br>          the jury that the plaintiff had to show some fault on the\r<br><br>          defendant's part to recover, and this issue is likely to arise on\r<br><br>          retrial. Consequently, we tackle it here.\r<br><br>                    Levinsky's tries to head off this inquiry altogether. It\r<br><br>          asserts that any instructional error was a postmortem wound\r<br><br>          inflicted after Wal-Mart had committed legal suicide both by\r<br><br>          failing to contest Olson's negligence during the trial and by\r<br><br>          admitting negligence in its closing argument. The nisi prius roll\r<br><br>          does not verify this autopsy report.\r<br><br>                    The record clearly shows that Wal-Mart contested\r<br><br>          negligence at all times. Throughout the trial, it endeavored to\r<br><br><br>                                         25\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          demonstrate that Olson's comments were not culpable, but, rather,\r<br><br>          were reasonably based on his personal observation of conditions at\r<br><br>          Levinsky's stores. By the same token, Levinsky's charge that Wal-\r<br><br>          Mart's trial counsel conceded negligence reads too much into too\r<br><br>          little.\r<br><br>                    Specifically, Levinsky's points to the acknowledgement,\r<br><br>          repeated twice in the course of Wal-Mart's summation, that Olson\r<br><br>          \"made a mistake.\" Certainly, an admission of counsel during trial\r<br><br>          is binding on the client. See \r                                        Oscanyan v. \r                                                    Arms Co.\r                                                            , 103 U.S. 261,\r<br><br>          263-64 (1880). To qualify as an admission, though, counsel's\r<br><br>          statement, when taken in context, must be clear and unambiguous.\r<br><br>          See \r             MacDonald v. \r                          General Motors Corp.\r                                              , 110 F.3d 337, 340 (6th Cir.\r<br><br>          1997); \r                United States\r                              v. \r                                 Insurance Co. of N. Am.\r                                                       , 83 F.3d 1507, 1511\r<br><br>          n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Schott \r                                       Motorcycle \r                                                  Supply, \r                                                          Inc. v.  American\r<br><br>          Honda Motor Co., 976 F.2d 58, 61 (1st Cir. 1992).\r<br><br>                    Here, counsel's statement that Olson \"made a mistake\"\r<br><br>          falls measurably short of this benchmark. In its most natural\r<br><br>          iteration, the remark can be understood as referring to Olson's\r<br><br>          breach of his company's media communications policy. Disregarding\r<br><br>          company policy is risky _ but it may or may not be negligent. Few\r<br><br>          would doubt that if Olson could go back in time and exercise his\r<br><br>          option to stand mute in the face of Boardman's interrogation, he\r<br><br>          would do so. Characterizing Olson's conduct as a mistake, then,\r<br><br>          probably had little to do with the issue of negligence. In all\r<br><br>          events, it strains credulity to label counsel's description of\r<br><br>          Olson's actions as a clear, unambiguous admission that those\r<br><br><br>                                         26\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          actions satisfied the legal standard of fault. Consequently, we\r<br><br>          reach the merits of the jury instruction claim.\r<br><br>                    We review challenges to jury instructions with a focus on\r<br><br>          whether the instructions \"adequately illuminate the law applicable\r<br><br>          to the controlling issues in the case without unduly complicating\r<br><br>          matters or misleading the jury.\"  United \r                                                   States v. DeStefano, 59\r<br><br>          F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995). An erroneous instruction requires a new\r<br><br>          trial if the preserved error, based on a review of the entire\r<br><br>          record, can fairly be said to have prejudiced the objecting party.\r<br><br>          See United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 976 (1st Cir. 1995).\r<br><br>                    In this instance, Wal-Mart requested a jury instruction\r<br><br>          on negligence, but the trial judge denied the request and charged\r<br><br>          the jury on the elements of defamation without mentioning fault.\r<br><br>          Wal-Mart interposed a timely and legally sufficient objection. \r                                                                        See\r<br><br>          Fed. R. Civ. P. 51.\r<br><br>                    The trial judge made his position very clear. He\r<br><br>          reasoned that the doctrine of defamation per se applied, and that,\r<br><br>          because malice is implied in cases of defamation per se, a\r<br><br>          negligence instruction would be pointless. We agree with the\r<br><br>          court's premise but not with its conclusion.\r<br><br>                    As we explained earlier, \r                                            see \r                                               supra Part III(D), Maine law\r<br><br>          does not recognize liability without fault in defamation cases.\r<br><br>          Contrary to the district court's view, Maine's allegiance to the\r<br><br>          doctrine of defamation per se does not alter this rule. That\r<br><br>          doctrine is relevant to damages, not to liability. Under it,\r<br><br>          claimants in certain defamation cases need not prove actual damages\r<br><br><br>                                         27\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          as a prerequisite to recovery.     See Rippett, 672 A.2d at 86\r<br><br>          (applying the doctrine when the defendant's statement adversely\r<br><br>          reflects on the plaintiff's business); \r                                                Ramirez v. \r                                                           Rogers, 540 A.2d\r<br><br>          475, 478 (Me. 1988) (applying the doctrine when the defendant's\r<br><br>          statement implies a false charge of criminal conduct).\r<br><br>                    It is true, of course, that Maine's Supreme Judicial\r<br><br>          Court has held that \"malice is implied as a matter of law in\r<br><br>          [defamation per se] cases.\"  Saunders v. Van Pelt, 497 A.2d 1121,\r<br><br>          1124-25 (Me. 1985). In one sense, that declaration might make it\r<br><br>          seem that the doctrine relieves such a plaintiff of any burden to\r<br><br>          show fault. But as this case proves, appearances are sometimes\r<br><br>          deceiving.\r<br><br>                    Common law malice refers only to state of mind,\r<br><br>          specifically, ill will or spite.      See Masson v.   New  \r                                                                     Yorker\r<br><br>          Magazine, Inc.\r                       , 501 U.S. 496, 510-11 (1991); \r                                                     Lester, 596 A.2d at 70\r<br><br>          n.8. The concept does not incorporate, and thus cannot subsume,\r<br><br>          any fault standard. This is in sharp contradistinction to actual\r<br><br>          malice, as that term is defined in the vocabulary of the First\r<br><br>          Amendment. Actual malice does incorporate a fault standard _\r<br><br>          \"knowledge that [a statement] was false or . . . reckless disregard\r<br><br>          [as to] whether it was false or not.\"    Masson, 501 U.S. at 510\r<br><br>          (quoting New York Times, 376 U.S. at 279-80). Maine's defamation\r<br><br>          per se doctrine contemplates the common law, rather than the\r<br><br>          constitutional, brand of malice.  See  Michaud v. Inhabitants \r                                                                         of\r<br><br>          Livermore Falls\r                        , 381 A.2d 1110, 1113 (Me. 1978). Hence, it is not\r<br><br>          a proxy for the showing of fault that state defamation law\r<br><br><br>                                         28\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          unambiguously requires.\r<br><br>                    A recent deployment of the defamation per se doctrine by\r<br><br>          Maine's highest court dispels any doubt on this score. In \r                                                                   Rippett,\r<br><br>          the trial court granted summary judgment against a plaintiff who\r<br><br>          claimed defamation per se because the police had made statements\r<br><br>          that falsely charged her with criminal activity. 672 A.2d at 84-\r<br><br>          86. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court reversed, holding that the\r<br><br>          plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence that the defendants had \r<br><br>          made defamatory statements \"on the basis of an investigation so flawed\r<br><br>          as to constitute at least negligence.\"     Id. at 86. This holding\r<br><br>          effectively reaffirmed Maine's requirement that a negligence element\r<br><br>          must exist in all defamation cases; if defamation per se obviated the\r<br><br>          need to show fault, the Rippett court's discussion of negligence would\r<br><br>          have been superfluous.\r<br><br>                    Accordingly, the court below erred in failing to instruct the\r<br><br>          jury on Maine's negligence requirement in defamation actions. At a\r<br><br>          subsequent trial, the district court should tender such an instruction.\r<br><br>          VI. CONCLUSION\r<br><br>                    We need go no further. Common sense suggests (and the record\r<br><br>          shows) that Olson's comments were intemperate. Still, the statement\r<br><br>          that something (a Levinsky's store, or its contents, or its owner) was\r<br><br>          \"trashy\" cannot be objectively verified and thus is not actionable in a\r<br><br>          defamation suit. That error poisons the general verdict, even though\r<br><br>          Olson's other statement _ \"20 minutes on hold\" _ is fit for jury\r<br><br>          consumption. Consequently, the general verdict must be set aside and\r<br><br>          the case remanded for a new trial, subject, however, to whatever\r<br><br><br>                                            29\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          resolution the lower court may make in regard to whether Olson's\r<br><br>          comments implicated a matter of public concern, and if so, whether the\r<br><br>          evidence is sufficient to show actual malice. If a new trial\r<br><br>          transpires, the jury should be instructed, inter alia, on the element of\r<br><br>          negligence under Maine defamation law.\r<br><br><br><br>                    Reversed and remanded.\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                            30\r</pre>\n\n</div>",

Our enduring national devotion to\r<br><br>          freedom of expression, embodied in the First Amendment and renewed\r<br><br>          in \r            New York Times Co.\r                               v. \r                                  Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106761\"><a href=\"/opinion/106761/new-york-times-co-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span> (1964), inevitably\r<br><br>          means that much offensive and inaccurate speech will remain free\r<br><br>          from legal constraints. Still, there are boundaries past which\r<br><br>          speakers cannot trespass. This case illustrates how difficult it\r<br><br>          is to trace those boundaries with the precision that the law\r<br><br>          demands.\r<br><br>          I. STORE WARS\r<br><br>                    The events that gave rise to this litigation are\r<br><br>          controversial but, for the most part, not controverted. We present\r<br><br>          a balanced synopsis here.\r<br><br>                    The plaintiff, Levinsky's, Inc. (Levinsky's), is a\r<br><br>          family-owned business that operates three retail clothing stores in\r<br><br>          Maine. It has deep roots in the community. The defendant, Wal-\r<br><br>          Mart Stores, Inc. (Wal-Mart), is the nation's largest retailer. It\r<br><br>          is a relative newcomer to the Maine marketplace. The two compete\r<br><br>          head to head in the Portland area.\r<br><br>                    In the fall of 1994, Levinsky's decided to run a tongue-\r<br><br>          in-cheek radio advertisement that forged a comparison between it\r<br><br>          and Wal-Mart. A snippet from the ad reflects its tone:\r<br><br>          \"Levinsky's has a great selection and the lowest prices in Maine on\r<br><br>          Levi's jeans, Dockers and denim shirts. Wal-Mart doesn't carry\r<br><br>          Levi's, but we did get a good buy on a toaster.\" The spot aired in\r<br><br>          the Portland area for about six weeks during the pre-Christmas\r<br><br>          shopping season.\r<br><br><br>                                          2\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>                    Intrigued by the unorthodox advertising campaign, Michael\r<br><br>          Boardman, a free-lance writer for the Portland business magazine\r<br><br>          Biz, decided to write a \"David versus Goliath\" story about\r<br><br>          Levinsky's aggressive reaction to Wal-Mart's entry into the\r<br><br>          marketplace. The article appeared in  Biz's January/February 1995\r<br><br>          issue under the headline \"Levinsky's: Leaner and meaner with\r<br><br>          retail competition.\" In the text, Boardman compared Levinsky's to\r<br><br>          a \"feisty kid who fights the school bully for his lunch money.\"\r<br><br>                    While researching the story, Boardman telephoned Gilbert\r<br><br>          Olson, the manager of Wal-Mart's store in Scarborough, Maine (a\r<br><br>          Portland suburb). Olson testified that he thought Boardman was a\r<br><br>          college student researching a paper, but Boardman maintained that\r<br><br>          he clearly identified himself as a journalist and stated the\r<br><br>          purpose of his call. At any rate, Olson made two statements during\r<br><br>          his conversation with Boardman that lie at the epicenter of this\r<br><br>          appeal. First, he described a Levinsky's store as \"trashy.\"\r<br><br>          Second, he stated that when a person called Levinsky's, \"you are\r<br><br>          sometimes put on hold for 20 minutes _ or the phone is never picked\r<br><br>          up at all.\"  Biz printed these (and other) remarks, attributing\r<br><br>          them to Wal-Mart.\r<br><br>                    Shortly thereafter, Levinsky's and several family members\r<br><br>          sued Wal-Mart for defamation, injurious falsehood, false light,\r<br><br>          deceptive trade practices, interference with advantageous economic\r<br><br>          relations, and infliction of emotional distress. Their complaint,\r<br><br>          filed in the federal district court under diversity jurisdiction,\r<br><br>          28 U.S.C. S 1332(a) (1994), sought $40,000,000 in compensatory and\r<br><br><br>                                          3\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          presumed damages, plus punitive damages equal to 2% of Wal-Mart's\r<br><br>          net worth. Most of these claims were weeded out before or during\r<br><br>          trial. The defamation claims survived. The jury found that the\r<br><br>          individual family members had not been defamed, but awarded\r<br><br>          Levinsky's $600,000 for presumed damages to reputation\r<br><br>          (notwithstanding the lack of any specific evidence of actual\r<br><br>          pecuniary loss). The jury also determined that Olson had not acted\r<br><br>          with ill will and declined to award Levinsky's exemplary damages.\r<br><br>                    The district judge upheld the verdict and made several\r<br><br>          rulings that bear on this appeal. First, the judge found that the\r<br><br>          verdict did not offend the First Amendment because both the word\r<br><br>          \"trashy\" and the \"20 minutes on hold\" comments stated opinions that\r<br><br>          implied provably false facts. Second, because Olson's statements\r<br><br>          related to Levinsky's business, the judge concluded that presumed\r<br><br>          damages were available. Third, emphasizing Olson's subjective\r<br><br>          belief that he was not speaking to a reporter but to a university\r<br><br>          student, the judge determined that Olson's comments did not relate\r<br><br>          to a matter of public concern, and that, therefore, Levinsky's did\r<br><br>          not need to show actual malice as a precondition to the award of\r<br><br>          presumed damages. Fourth, the judge ruled that, under Maine's\r<br><br>          defamation per se doctrine, a finding of defamation that related to\r<br><br>          the plaintiff's business established legally sufficient fault and\r<br><br><br>                              \r<br><br>               Among other things, the district court ruled that other\r<br>          statements which Olson had uttered were not actionable and\r<br>          pretermitted various causes of action. These matters are not\r<br>          within the compass of this appeal and we make no further mention of\r<br>          them.\r<br><br>                                          4\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          thus obviated any need for a jury instruction on negligence.\r<br><br>          II. A SHOPPING LIST\r<br><br>                    This appeal offers a large inventory of interleaved legal\r<br><br>          issues. We pick our way through that inventory by traversing the\r<br><br>          intersection of the First Amendment and state defamation law as it\r<br><br>          has developed over time, noting, inter alia, a restriction on the\r<br><br>          scope of defamation imposed by Maine law. We next discuss one of\r<br><br>          the two allegedly defamatory statements _ the \"trashy\" reference _\r<br><br>          and conclude, as a matter of federal constitutional law, that it\r<br><br>          cannot support a recovery. We then address the second statement _\r<br><br>          \"20 minutes on hold\" _ and conclude that it is actionable. We move\r<br><br>          at that point to the matter of public concern (but do not resolve\r<br><br>          it). Finally, because a new trial is required, we offer some\r<br><br>          guidance to the district court in connection with the role of\r<br><br>          negligence in Maine defamation cases.\r<br><br>          III. STAPLES: THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND STATE DEFAMATION LAW\r<br><br>                    For many years, states enacted statutes and applied\r<br><br>          common law tort principles in the area of defamation with no more\r<br><br>          than a passing nod to the First Amendment's free speech guaranty.\r<br><br>          This era of constitutional non-interference ended when the Justices\r<br><br>          proclaimed \"a profound national commitment to the principle that\r<br><br>          debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-\r<br><br>          open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes\r<br><br>          unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\"\r<br><br>          New York Times\r                       , 376 U.S. at 270. Faithful to this ideal, the Court\r<br><br>          announced that the First Amendment precludes recovery by a public\r<br><br><br>                                          5\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          official under state defamation law unless the official shows that\r<br><br>          the speaker acted with actual malice, that is, with knowledge of or\r<br><br>          reckless disregard for the falsity of the statement.  See id. at\r<br><br>          279-80.\r<br><br>                    The seeds sown in \r                                     New York Times\r                                                    have blossomed over the\r<br><br>          years, giving rise to a crop of checks on the sweep of state\r<br><br>          defamation law. We harvest four points.\r<br><br>                          A.  Independent Appellate Review.\r<br><br>                    First, the deference traditionally shown by courts toward\r<br><br>          factfinders' determinations is muted when defamation issues\r<br><br>          implicate free speech concerns. In such circumstances, appellate\r<br><br>          judges must conduct a whole-record review and \"examine for\r<br><br>          [them]selves the statements in issue and the circumstances under\r<br><br>          which they were made to see . . . whether they are of a character\r<br><br>          which the principles of the First Amendment\" protect.  Id. at 285\r<br><br>          (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This requirement\r<br><br>          of independent appellate review is not a procedural directive, but,\r<br><br>          rather, \"a rule of federal constitutional law\" that \"reflects a\r<br><br>          deeply held conviction that judges . . . must exercise such review\r<br><br>          in order to preserve the precious liberties established and\r<br><br>          ordained by the Constitution.\"  Bose \r                                               Corp. v.

Indeed, when the\r<br><br>          imperative of independent review conflicts with a standard\r<br><br>          procedural dictate (such as Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)), the\r<br><br>          constitutional mandate controls.  See id. at 514.\r<br><br>                    As a practical matter, this requirement means that\r<br><br><br>                                          6\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          federal courts engage in de novo review when mulling defamation\r<br><br>          issues that are tinged with constitutional implications.

Opinions May Be Actionable.\r<br><br>                    The First Amendment does not inoculate all opinions\r<br><br>          against the ravages of defamation suits. A statement couched as an\r<br><br>          opinion that presents or implies the existence of facts which are\r<br><br>          capable of being proven true or false can be actionable.      See\r<br><br>          Milkovich v. \r                      Lorain Journal Co.\r                                        , <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112470\"><a href=\"/opinion/112470/milkovich-v-lorain-journal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 18-19 (1990); \r                                                                   see \r                                                                       also\r<br><br>          Restatement (Second) of Torts S 566 (1977) (\"A defamatory\r<br><br>          communication may consist of a statement in the form of an opinion,\r<br><br>          but a statement of this nature is actionable only if it implies the\r<br><br>          allegation of undisclosed defamatory facts as the basis for the\r<br><br>          opinion.\"). Thus, a statement normally is not actionable unless\r<br><br>          it contains an objectively verifiable assertion.   Chief Judge\r<br><br>                              \r<br><br>               Restatement S 566 seemingly applies the \r                                                      Milkovich standard to\r<br>          defamation actions regardless of whether the challenged statements\r<br>          address issues of public or private concern.

Thus, the First Amendment prohibits defamation actions\r<br><br>          based on loose, figurative language that no reasonable person would\r<br><br>          believe presented facts.

For better or\r<br><br>          worse, our society has long since passed the stage at which the use\r<br><br>          of the word \"bastard\" would occasion an investigation into the\r<br><br>          target's lineage or the cry \"you pig\" would prompt a probe for a\r<br><br>          porcine pedigree. Hyperbole is very much the coin of the modern\r<br><br>          realm. In extending full constitutional protection to this\r<br><br>          category of speech, the  Milkovich Court recognized the need to\r<br><br>          segregate casually used words, no matter how tastelessly couched,\r<br><br>          from fact-based accusations.\r<br><br>                     C.

Of particular relevance here is\r<br><br>          the Court's holding that a private individual who seeks damages for\r<br><br>          a defamatory statement involving a matter of public concern cannot\r<br><br>          recover presumed or punitive damages absent a showing of actual\r<br><br>          malice.

Simply put, Maine\r<br><br>          defamation law does not recognize liability without fault; rather,\r<br><br>          as a predicate to recovery, Maine requires a defamation plaintiff\r<br><br>          to show that the defendant acted at least negligently.

THE NATURE OF THE STATEMENTS\r<br><br>                    The two statements that the district court permitted the\r<br><br>          jury to consider are not in legal equipoise.

This ruling rested on the court's expressed\r<br><br>          view that the term had a single, readily ascertainable meaning _\r<br><br><br>                              \r<br><br>               It is unclear whether the First Amendment prohibits a state\r<br>          from imposing strict liability in a defamation case brought by a\r<br>          private plaintiff concerning statements that implicate a matter of\r<br>          private concern.  See Snead v. Redland Aggregates, Ltd., 998 F.2d\r<br>          1325, 1334 (5th Cir. 1993) (discussing the question and concluding\r<br>          that the First Amendment \"imposes no minimum standard of fault in\r<br>          private/private libel cases\"). Because Maine has articulated a\r<br>          minimum negligence standard for all defamation actions, we need not\r<br>          ponder the constitutional issue here.\r<br><br>                                         10\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          \"dirty or unkempt\" _ and that, in Judge Carter's words, Olson's\r<br><br>          statement could be \"verified or disproved through straightforward\r<br><br>          inquiry into the condition of [Levinsky's] store's physical\r<br><br>          appearance.\" We do not agree.\r<br><br>                    Despite avowals that all speech is infinitely malleable,\r<br><br>          see, e.g., Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass, ch. 6 (1872)\r<br><br>          (reporting Humpty Dumpty's declaration: \"When I use a word, it\r<br><br>          means just what I choose it to mean _ neither more nor less.\"), the\r<br><br>          First Amendment does not allow courts the luxury of a\r<br><br>          deconstructionist approach to language. Some words or phrases\r<br><br>          evoke a multiplicity of meanings; others do not. Under the aegis\r<br><br>          of the First Amendment, a particular word or phrase ordinarily\r<br><br>          cannot be defamatory unless in a given context it reasonably can be\r<br><br>          understood as having an easily ascertainable and objectively\r<br><br>          verifiable meaning. The vaguer a term, or the more meanings it\r<br><br>          reasonably can convey, the less likely it is to be actionable.\r<br><br>          See, \r              e.g., \r                    Phantom Touring\r                                   , 953 F.2d at 728 (holding that newspaper\r<br><br>          articles that referred to the plaintiff's production of \"The\r<br><br>          Phantom of the Opera\" as \"fake\" and \"phony\" were not actionable\r<br><br>          because the descriptions were \"unprovable,\" inasmuch as \"those\r<br><br>          adjectives admit of numerous interpretations\"); \r                                                        McCabe v. \r                                                                  Rattiner,\r<br><br>          <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485245\"><a href=\"/opinion/485245/thomas-mccabe-v-daniel-rattiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span>, 842-43 (1st Cir. 1987) (holding that a newspaper\r<br><br>          headline which referred to the plaintiff's real estate development\r<br><br>          as a \"scam\" was not actionable because the word means different\r<br><br>          things to different people and \"[t]he lack of precision makes the\r<br><br>          assertion `X is a scam' incapable of being proven true of false\").\r<br><br><br>                                         11\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>                    It is against this mise-en-scene that we must explore the\r<br><br>          meaning of the word \"trashy.\" We start, as we often do in\r<br><br>          searching out the meaning of a word, with the dictionary.\r<br><br>          Lexicographic sources do not reflect any specific meaning of the\r<br><br>          word.

An English author\r<br><br>          preferred its \"prurient interest\" connotation when she complained\r<br><br>          of reading \"the trashiest heap of novels.\" Jane Welsh Carlyle,\r<br><br>          Letters \r                  and \r                      Memorials (1883). Edmund Wilson found the \"lacking\r<br><br>          worth\" meaning useful when he described Rudyard Kipling's \r                                                                   Stalky &amp;\r<br><br>          Company as \"crude in writing [and] trashy in feeling.\" Edmund\r<br><br>          Wilson, The Wound and the Bow 114 (1941). Louis Bromfield showed\r<br><br>          a more traditionalist bent, favoring the classic \"covered with\r<br><br>          withered growth\" meaning of the word when he wrote of a seedbed\r<br><br>          that \"was rough and trashy.\" Louis Bromfield, Pleasant Valley 174\r<br><br>          (1945). While these four illustrations merely scratch the surface,\r<br><br>          they amply demonstrate the term's definitional flexibility.\r<br><br>                    The usages paraded through the courtroom by Levinsky's\r<br><br>          able counsel reinforce this point. Particularly revelatory are his\r<br><br>          opening and closing statements, in which he seemed frankly to\r<br><br>          acknowledge the word's many connotations. At various times,\r<br><br>          counsel suggested to the jury that Olson's statement referred to\r<br><br>          the manner in which the plaintiff maintained its stores (in this\r<br><br>          context meaning \"filthy\" and \"dirty\"), to the merchandise that the\r<br><br>          plaintiff purveyed (in this context meaning \"inferior\" and\r<br><br>          \"crappy\"), and to the character of the persons associated with the\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                         13\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          enterprise (in this context meaning \"sleazy\" and \"untrustworthy\").\r<br><br>          This broadcast acknowledgement that the word \"trashy\" possesses a\r<br><br>          multitude of fairly ascribable meanings is in itself telling.\r<br><br>                    In this instance, moreover, the inherent elusiveness of\r<br><br>          \"trashy\" is not pinned down by context. Indeed, the imprecision of\r<br><br>          the word is accentuated by the testimony of the journalist,\r<br><br>          Boardman, who, when asked his understanding of \"trashy\" as Olson\r<br><br>          had voiced it, responded, \"It's always been hard for me to define\r<br><br>          exactly what he was referring to.\" In the same vein, Boardman\r<br><br>          reported that Olson's only amplification of the remark was that\r<br><br>          \"customers should pay a little more money to buy the same item they\r<br><br>          want somewhere else.\" Like \"trashy\" itself, this comment presents\r<br><br>          a moving target.\r<br><br>                    The polysemous nature of the word \"trashy\" dooms\r<br><br>          Levinsky's effort to recover for Olson's use of it. The word\r<br><br>          \"trashy\" is a chameleon that continuously changes colors and shades\r<br><br>          of meaning. It admits of numerous interpretations. We can imagine\r<br><br>          no objective evidence that might conclusively prove or disprove it.\r<br><br>          Like the equally pejorative terms used in \r                                                   Phantom Touring\r                                                                   (\"fake,\"\r<br><br>          \"phony,\" \"rip-off\"), McCabe (\"scam\"), and Dilworth v.

We give this tergiversation short shrift. Those who\r<br>          sue for defamation are not at liberty to pick and choose among a\r<br>          word's various possible definitions and saddle the speaker with the\r<br>          consequences.\r<br><br>                                         14\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          F.3d 307, 310-11 (7th Cir. 1996) (allowing no defamation remedy\r<br><br>          when one scholar calls another a \"crank\"), \"trashy\" is\r<br><br>          quintessentially subjective.\r<br><br>                    To say more about this point would be supererogatory.\r<br><br>          Branding a store, its merchandise, its customers, or its\r<br><br>          proprietors as \"trashy\" is uncomplimentary, and it may be\r<br><br>          unwarranted; in the last analysis, however, such a comment is loose\r<br><br>          language that cannot be objectively verified. Consequently, it\r<br><br>          belongs squarely in the category of protected opinion.

On Hold.\r<br><br>                    The district court likewise ruled that Olson's second\r<br><br>          statement (when calling Levinsky's, \"you are sometimes put on hold\r<br><br>          for 20 minutes _ or the phone is never picked up at all\")\r<br><br>          encompassed matters of fact (or opinions that implied provably\r<br><br>          false facts) and was, therefore, actionable. Wal-Mart takes\r<br><br>          exception to this ruling. Its principal argument is that\r<br><br>          constitutional shelter for this statement can be found in the First\r<br><br>          Amendment protections typically afforded figurative language and\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                         15\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          hyperbole. We think not.\r<br><br>                    Certain excesses of language cannot ground a defamation\r<br><br>          claim because, in context, those excesses involve only puffery or\r<br><br>          epithets, and thus are insufficiently fact-based.     See,  e.g.,\r<br><br>          Austin, 418 U.S. at 284-86 (\"traitor\"); \r                                                 Bresler, 398 U.S. at 13-14\r<br><br>          (\"blackmail\"). These turns of phrase are recognized rhetorical\r<br><br>          devices; they are not actionable because they are commonly\r<br><br>          understood, in context, as imaginative expressions rather than\r<br><br>          statements of fact.\r<br><br>                    Paddling furiously to reach this safe harbor, the\r<br><br>          appellant urges us to interpret Olson's comment as an obvious\r<br><br>          exaggeration, tantamount to the statement \"you are sometimes put on\r<br><br>          hold forever.\" No reasonable listener, the appellant asseverates,\r<br><br>          would consider this variant an assertion of literal truth. But the\r<br><br>          appellant's argument requires a leap of faith that we are unwilling\r<br><br>          to essay. The First Amendment does not allow courts to distort the\r<br><br>          reality of events under the guise of protecting freedom of\r<br><br>          expression. Thus, a reviewing court must evaluate a speaker's\r<br><br>          statement as it was given and must resist the temptation to replace\r<br><br>          what was actually said with some more innocuous alternative.\r<br><br>                    The determination of whether a statement is hyperbole\r<br><br>                              \r<br><br>               Wal-Mart's other arguments on this point can be dismissed out\r<br>          of hand. In this wise, we note that the record contains no\r<br>          evidence from which a jury supportably could find that this comment\r<br>          was literally true. At trial, Olson testified that on three\r<br>          separate occasions he had called Levinsky's and had been put on\r<br>          hold for \r                   a \r                     total \r                            of \r                               20 \r                                  minutes \r                                           or \r                                              more (but no longer than 10\r<br>          minutes on any one occasion). The appellant adduced no other\r<br>          evidence suggesting that Olson's statement was accurate.\r<br><br>                                         16\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          depends primarily upon whether a reasonable person could interpret\r<br><br>          the statement to provide actual facts about the individual or\r<br><br>          institution it describes.   See  Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 20;   cf.\r<br><br>          Hustler  \r                  Magazine,  \r                             Inc. v.   Falwell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112011\"><a href=\"/opinion/112011/hustler-magazine-inc-v-falwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 50 (1988)\r<br><br>          (precluding recovery on the ground that an advertising parody,\r<br><br>          which claimed that a minister had lost his virginity in a drunken\r<br><br>          rendezvous with his mother, was incredible). Under this criterion,\r<br><br>          the \"20 minutes\" statement seems sufficiently factual to be proved\r<br><br>          true or false. For one thing, Olson's use of a specific time frame\r<br><br>          cuts against treating his remark as hyperbole or other non-factual\r<br><br>          speech. For another thing, the assertion can be verified or\r<br><br>          rebutted by objective evidence of how Levinsky's staff handled\r<br><br>          telephone calls (evidence of the type that, in fact, Levinsky's\r<br><br>          adduced and the jury heard). In addition, the statement is not\r<br><br>          inherently implausible. Especially given the pervasive folklore\r<br><br>          concerning the difficulties that consumers encounter in dealing\r<br><br>          with merchants telephonically, we believe that a reasonable\r<br><br>          listener could interpret the \"20 minutes\" comment as a statement of\r<br><br>          fact about Levinsky's business practices.\r<br><br>                    As the appellant correctly notes, we cannot take the \"20\r<br><br>          minutes\" remark in isolation. Seizing this potential lifeline,\r<br><br>          Wal-Mart struggles to persuade us that the second part of Olson's\r<br><br>          statement _ \"the phone is never picked up at all\" _ colors the\r<br><br>          context and makes it plain that he was speaking figuratively.\r<br><br>          Though context is an important aspect of the \r                                                     Milkovich inquiry, \r                                                                        see\r<br><br>          Phantom \r                  Touring, 953 F.2d at 727; McCabe, 814 F.2d at 842-43, it\r<br><br><br>                                         17\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          does not aid the appellant here. While the second portion of\r<br><br>          Olson's statement does not incorporate a fixed temporal interval,\r<br><br>          that remark, when read in tandem with the first portion of the\r<br><br>          statement, does not defuse the defamatory potential. A reasonable\r<br><br>          listener could well conclude that Levinsky's service was so bad\r<br><br>          that the company not only left customers dangling on the line for\r<br><br>          20 minutes at a crack, but also, on some occasions, simply did not\r<br><br>          bother to answer the telephone.\r<br><br>                    In fine, the overall context does little to dispel the\r<br><br>          impression that Olson's comment stated facts about Levinsky's\r<br><br>          business practices. After all, Levinsky's and Wal-Mart were locked\r<br><br>          in hand-to-hand combat for shoppers' dollars, and Olson held an\r<br><br>          executive position with Wal-Mart. While a reasonable listener\r<br><br>          might be skeptical given Olson's likely motive (to try to lure\r<br><br>          potential customers to his store), he gave his assertion a\r<br><br>          particularized factual component. A listener reasonably could\r<br><br>          conclude that Olson intended to describe from personal knowledge\r<br><br>          how Levinsky's treated callers.\r<br><br>                    The short of it is that neither the type of language\r<br><br>          employed nor the overall tenor of the article negated the\r<br><br>          reasonable impression that Olson steadfastly maintained that\r<br><br>          Levinsky's telephone practices were in fact as he described them to\r<br><br>                              \r<br><br>               Olson did not furnish Boardman, and Boardman did not print,\r<br>          any factual predicate for the assertions. This distinguishes them\r<br>          from certain comments discussed in  Phantom \r                                                      Touring, 953 F.2d at\r<br>          729, where context made it unmistakably clear that the challenged\r<br>          speech, though superficially capable of being proved true or false,\r<br>          represented only a point of view.\r<br><br>                                         18\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          be. On this basis, the \"20 minutes\" statement properly could be\r<br><br>          treated as fact-based defamation. So viewed, the statement does\r<br><br>          not fit within the contours of protected speech, and it was, as the\r<br><br>          lower court concluded, amenable to suit under the \r                                                          Milkovich regime.\r<br><br>          V. PUBLIC CONCERN\r<br><br>                    Even though the \"20 minutes\" statement is actionable, the\r<br><br>          appellant has another defense in stock. The jury awarded only\r<br><br>          presumed damages, and the Constitution forbids an award of presumed\r<br><br>          or punitive damages for words spoken without actual malice on\r<br><br>          matters of public concern. See \r                                         Dun &amp; Bradstreet\r                                                         , 472 U.S. at 756.\r<br><br>          Wal-Mart contends that this is such a case.\r<br><br>                    The Supreme Court has roughly bisected the sphere of\r<br><br>          social commentary between matters of public concern, which are\r<br><br>          those that can be \"fairly considered as relating to any matter of\r<br><br>          political, social, or other concern to the community,\" and matters\r<br><br>          of private concern, which are those that address \"matters only of\r<br><br>          personal interest.\"  Connick, 461 U.S. at 146-47. A court must\r<br><br>          determine whether a statement comes within the public concern\r<br><br>          hemisphere of this formulation by reference to its \"content, form\r<br><br>          and context.\"  Dun &amp; Bradstreet, 472 U.S. at 761. In order to do\r<br><br>          so, the relevant community need not be very large and the relevant\r<br><br>          concern need not be of paramount importance or national scope.\r<br><br>                              \r<br><br>               Levinsky's assertion that Wal-Mart waived the right to raise\r<br>          the public concern issue is meritless. The opinions of the\r<br>          magistrate judge and the district judge in this case show beyond\r<br>          any peradventure of doubt that Wal-Mart consistently pressed the\r<br>          public concern argument in the proceedings below, and the trial\r<br>          transcript confirms that fact.\r<br><br>                                         19\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          Rather, \"it is sufficient that the speech concern matters in which\r<br><br>          even a relatively small segment of the general public might be\r<br><br>          interested.\" Roe v. \r                              City of San Francisco\r                                                   , <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738301\"><a href=\"/opinion/738301/97-cal-daily-op-serv-2087-97-daily-journal-dar-3848-john-roe-v-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span>, 585 (9th\r<br><br>          Cir. 1997).\r<br><br>                    When called upon to perform a public concern analysis,\r<br><br>          courts have found the   Connick line of cases, i.e., judicial\r<br><br>          decisions involving public employees fired for making comments that\r<br><br>          arguably relate to matters of public concern, to be instructive.\r<br><br>          The Supreme Court has approved this analogy, \r                                                      see \r                                                          Dun &amp; Bradstreet\r                                                                          ,\r<br><br>          472 U.S. at 759, and we encourage its use. Still, jurists and\r<br><br>          lawyers alike should employ it with a caveat in mind. Public\r<br><br>          employee cases typically involve speech on matters relating to\r<br><br>          public sector jobs, and criticism of the workings of government is\r<br><br>          at the core of conduct protected by the First Amendment.  See New\r<br><br>          York \r               Times, 376 U.S. at 282-83, 292. Statements that implicate\r<br><br>          issues outside the public sector may require more rigorous\r<br><br>          analysis.\r<br><br>                    In this case, the appellant argues that the \"20 minutes\"\r<br><br>          statement related to a matter of public concern because       Biz\r<br><br>          published it in an article describing the \"David versus Goliath\"\r<br><br>          battle between Wal-Mart and a local, family-owned business. To\r<br><br>          bolster this argument, Wal-Mart points out that Boardman decided to\r<br><br>          write the piece because this type of business struggle had sparked\r<br><br>          intense interest across the country and because Levinsky's radio\r<br><br>          advertisements had called attention to a local microcosm of this\r<br><br>          struggle. Levinsky's counters by characterizing the comments as\r<br><br><br>                                         20\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          statements made in the course of a dispute between two private\r<br><br>          businesses. The mere fact that the competition between the two\r<br><br>          merchants interested a journalist, Levinsky's posits, does not make\r<br><br>          the matter one of public concern.\r<br><br>                    The district court decided this issue in Levinsky's\r<br><br>          favor, but based its decision entirely on Olson's testimony that he\r<br><br>          thought he was engaged in a private conversation with a college\r<br><br>          student. This prop is very shaky. Passing the probability that\r<br><br>          the prop is constructed from less than sturdy factual material _\r<br><br>          Olson's query to Boardman (\"You're not going to use my name, are\r<br><br>          you?\") suggests that at some point he did realize that Boardman\r<br><br>          would convey his comments to a wider audience _ we do not think\r<br><br>          that a speaker's subjective belief as to who will hear his\r<br><br>          statements should be the sole determinant of the constitutional\r<br><br>          question.\r<br><br>                    To be sure, we have recognized that in some circumstances\r<br><br>          a private statement might not qualify \"on the basis of its content\r<br><br>          alone, as a matter of inherent public concern,\" and that a court\r<br><br>          therefore may consider the speaker's \"subjective intent to\r<br><br>          contribute to any . . . public discourse.\"  O'Connor v.

It is thus apparent that the speaker's intent\r<br><br><br>                                         21\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          is only one of a constellation of relevant factors implicated by a\r<br><br>          whole-record review of the speech's form, content, and context.\r<br><br>          See Connick, 461 U.S. at 147-48; O'Connor, 994 F.2d at 914 &amp; n.5.\r<br><br>          The primary focus of the relevant constitutional inquiry must\r<br><br>          remain on the speech's content and the public's perception of the\r<br><br>          topic, not on the speaker's subjective belief as to the\r<br><br>          conversation's confidentiality.\r<br><br>                    We are confronted, then, with a situation in which the\r<br><br>          lower court's resolution of the public concern issue is undermined\r<br><br>          by its incomplete assessment of the form, content, and context of\r<br><br>          Olson's statements. That sort of disconnect is invariably a\r<br><br>          problem for an appellate court. Here, however, the problem is\r<br><br>          exacerbated in two ways.\r<br><br>                    First, if we proceed on the record as it stands, we will\r<br><br>          be compelled to resolve an unsettled question as to what sources an\r<br><br>          appellate court may consult in attempting to ascertain whether a\r<br><br>          statement relates to a matter of public concern. Of course,\r<br><br>          certain things are clear. We know, for example, that Levinsky's\r<br><br>          decision to sue Wal-Mart does not retroactively confer public\r<br><br>          concern status on Olson's statements. To the contrary, media\r<br><br>          coverage of the lawsuit itself is irrelevant on this issue.

Accordingly, even if the \"20 minutes\" statement\r<br><br>          involved a matter of public concern, an award of presumed damages\r<br><br>          would be constitutionally acceptable as long as the statement had\r<br><br>          been made with actual malice. In itself, this interrelation\r<br><br>          between public concern and actual malice is standard fare. Here,\r<br><br>          however, the district court did not resolve the actual malice\r<br><br>          question, either by submitting it to the jury or otherwise, because\r<br><br><br><br><br>                                         23\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          it had ruled against Wal-Mart on the public concern issue.\r<br><br>                    These complications counsel in favor of judicial\r<br><br>          restraint. Although we have the authority to resolve public\r<br><br>          concern issues ab initio at the appellate level, see Connick, 461\r<br><br>          U.S. at 147-48 &amp; n.7, we choose not to exercise that authority in\r<br><br>          this situation. We do not have the benefit of a reliable district\r<br><br>          court decision on the public concern issue; the record is very\r<br><br>          sparsely developed in regard to that issue; what evidence there is\r<br><br>          does not suggest a clear answer to whether or not Olson spoke on a\r<br><br>          matter of public concern; there is a substantial body of relevant\r<br><br>          evidence that was never presented below; and the existence \r                                                                    vel \r                                                                        non\r<br><br>          of actual malice remains problematic.

So it is here. Thus, we must remand for a new trial.\r<br><br>                    In other circumstances, this conclusion might end the\r<br><br>          appellate task. Here, however, the negligence issue persists:\r<br><br>          Wal-Mart assigns error to the district court's refusal to instruct\r<br><br>          the jury that the plaintiff had to show some fault on the\r<br><br>          defendant's part to recover, and this issue is likely to arise on\r<br><br>          retrial. Consequently, we tackle it here.\r<br><br>                    Levinsky's tries to head off this inquiry altogether. It\r<br><br>          asserts that any instructional error was a postmortem wound\r<br><br>          inflicted after Wal-Mart had committed legal suicide both by\r<br><br>          failing to contest Olson's negligence during the trial and by\r<br><br>          admitting negligence in its closing argument. The nisi prius roll\r<br><br>          does not verify this autopsy report.\r<br><br>                    The record clearly shows that Wal-Mart contested\r<br><br>          negligence at all times. Throughout the trial, it endeavored to\r<br><br><br>                                         25\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          demonstrate that Olson's comments were not culpable, but, rather,\r<br><br>          were reasonably based on his personal observation of conditions at\r<br><br>          Levinsky's stores. By the same token, Levinsky's charge that Wal-\r<br><br>          Mart's trial counsel conceded negligence reads too much into too\r<br><br>          little.\r<br><br>                    Specifically, Levinsky's points to the acknowledgement,\r<br><br>          repeated twice in the course of Wal-Mart's summation, that Olson\r<br><br>          \"made a mistake.\" Certainly, an admission of counsel during trial\r<br><br>          is binding on the client.

In its most natural\r<br><br>          iteration, the remark can be understood as referring to Olson's\r<br><br>          breach of his company's media communications policy. Disregarding\r<br><br>          company policy is risky _ but it may or may not be negligent. Few\r<br><br>          would doubt that if Olson could go back in time and exercise his\r<br><br>          option to stand mute in the face of Boardman's interrogation, he\r<br><br>          would do so. Characterizing Olson's conduct as a mistake, then,\r<br><br>          probably had little to do with the issue of negligence. In all\r<br><br>          events, it strains credulity to label counsel's description of\r<br><br>          Olson's actions as a clear, unambiguous admission that those\r<br><br><br>                                         26\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          actions satisfied the legal standard of fault. Consequently, we\r<br><br>          reach the merits of the jury instruction claim.\r<br><br>                    We review challenges to jury instructions with a focus on\r<br><br>          whether the instructions \"adequately illuminate the law applicable\r<br><br>          to the controlling issues in the case without unduly complicating\r<br><br>          matters or misleading the jury.\"  United \r                                                   States v.

An erroneous instruction requires a new\r<br><br>          trial if the preserved error, based on a review of the entire\r<br><br>          record, can fairly be said to have prejudiced the objecting party.\r<br><br>          See United States v.

R. Civ. P. 51.\r<br><br>                    The trial judge made his position very clear. He\r<br><br>          reasoned that the doctrine of defamation per se applied, and that,\r<br><br>          because malice is implied in cases of defamation per se, a\r<br><br>          negligence instruction would be pointless. We agree with the\r<br><br>          court's premise but not with its conclusion.\r<br><br>                    As we explained earlier, \r                                            see \r                                               supra Part III(D), Maine law\r<br><br>          does not recognize liability without fault in defamation cases.\r<br><br>          Contrary to the district court's view, Maine's allegiance to the\r<br><br>          doctrine of defamation per se does not alter this rule. That\r<br><br>          doctrine is relevant to damages, not to liability. Under it,\r<br><br>          claimants in certain defamation cases need not prove actual damages\r<br><br><br>                                         27\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          as a prerequisite to recovery.     See Rippett, 672 A.2d at 86\r<br><br>          (applying the doctrine when the defendant's statement adversely\r<br><br>          reflects on the plaintiff's business); \r                                                Ramirez v. \r                                                           Rogers, 540 A.2d\r<br><br>          475, 478 (Me. 1988) (applying the doctrine when the defendant's\r<br><br>          statement implies a false charge of criminal conduct).\r<br><br>                    It is true, of course, that Maine's Supreme Judicial\r<br><br>          Court has held that \"malice is implied as a matter of law in\r<br><br>          [defamation per se] cases.\"  Saunders v.

In one sense, that declaration might make it\r<br><br>          seem that the doctrine relieves such a plaintiff of any burden to\r<br><br>          show fault. But as this case proves, appearances are sometimes\r<br><br>          deceiving.\r<br><br>                    Common law malice refers only to state of mind,\r<br><br>          specifically, ill will or spite.

Maine's defamation\r<br><br>          per se doctrine contemplates the common law, rather than the\r<br><br>          constitutional, brand of malice.  See  Michaud v. Inhabitants \r                                                                         of\r<br><br>          Livermore Falls\r                        , <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></span>, 1113 (Me. 1978). Hence, it is not\r<br><br>          a proxy for the showing of fault that state defamation law\r<br><br><br>                                         28\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          unambiguously requires.\r<br><br>                    A recent deployment of the defamation per se doctrine by\r<br><br>          Maine's highest court dispels any doubt on this score. In \r                                                                   Rippett,\r<br><br>          the trial court granted summary judgment against a plaintiff who\r<br><br>          claimed defamation per se because the police had made statements\r<br><br>          that falsely charged her with criminal activity. 672 A.2d at 84-\r<br><br>          86. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court reversed, holding that the\r<br><br>          plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence that the defendants had \r<br><br>          made defamatory statements \"on the basis of an investigation so flawed\r<br><br>          as to constitute at least negligence.\"     Id. at 86. This holding\r<br><br>          effectively reaffirmed Maine's requirement that a negligence element\r<br><br>          must exist in all defamation cases; if defamation per se obviated the\r<br><br>          need to show fault, the Rippett court's discussion of negligence would\r<br><br>          have been superfluous.\r<br><br>                    Accordingly, the court below erred in failing to instruct the\r<br><br>          jury on Maine's negligence requirement in defamation actions. At a\r<br><br>          subsequent trial, the district court should tender such an instruction.\r<br><br>          VI. CONCLUSION\r<br><br>                    We need go no further. Common sense suggests (and the record\r<br><br>          shows) that Olson's comments were intemperate. Still, the statement\r<br><br>          that something (a Levinsky's store, or its contents, or its owner) was\r<br><br>          \"trashy\" cannot be objectively verified and thus is not actionable in a\r<br><br>          defamation suit. That error poisons the general verdict, even though\r<br><br>          Olson's other statement _ \"20 minutes on hold\" _ is fit for jury\r<br><br>          consumption. Consequently, the general verdict must be set aside and\r<br><br>          the case remanded for a new trial, subject, however, to whatever\r<br><br><br>                                            29\r\r<br><br><br><br><br>          resolution the lower court may make in regard to whether Olson's\r<br><br>          comments implicated a matter of public concern, and if so, whether the\r<br><br>          evidence is sufficient to show actual malice. If a new trial\r<br><br>          transpires, the jury should be instructed, inter alia, on the element of\r<br><br>          negligence under Maine defamation law.\r<br><br><br><br>                    Reversed and remanded.\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                            30\r</pre>\n\n</div>",
