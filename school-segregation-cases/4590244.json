Box 12068                 (RQ-1778)\nAustin, Texas. .78711\n\nDear Senator Parmer:\n\n     We understand  you to ask essentially   two questions.\nFirst, you ask us to specify the types of retirement   plans\nthat an appraisal district may offer its employees.  Second,\nyou wish to know what will be the income tax consequences to\nindividual appraisal   district  employees  and the proper\nmethod of disbursing funds held in any retirement plans    in\nthe event that any plans already in place were entered   into\nimproperly.\n\n        Your opinion 'request is prompted.by. the issuance of\nAttorney General Opinion JM-1068 (1989), which concluded\nthat appraisal     districts were without authority     to enter\ninto certain contracts providing         retirement   plans   for\nappraisal district     employees.    We construed   the question\nsubmitted in that request to ask whether            an appraisal\ndistrict had the authority      to create a local retirement\nsystem, authority similar to that conferred on incorporated\ncities and towns by V.T.C.S.      article 6243k and on counties\nby V.T.C.S.     article 62283.     Because no statute     confers\nexplicit authority     on appraisal    districts  or, for that\nmatter,    on any other sort of.special.district to create such\na local system, we concluded          that no such      authority\nexisted.1 The opinion apparently       has been misconstrued   to\n\n\n\n      1. This opinion should not be construed to call into\nquestion the legitimacy of a plan authorized by special law\ncreating a special district.\n\n\n\n\n                                P. 6012\n\fHonorable Hugh Panner - Page 2       (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\nhold that subsections   (b), (c), and (d) of secti.on 67 of\narticle XVI of the Texas Constitution       sets forth the\nexclusive   list of the retirement plans that political\nsubdivisions may provide for their employees.   However,  we\ndid not so hold; rather, we held that there was no statutory\nauthority to create the sort of system about which we\nunderstood the reguestor to inquire.\n\n     We will answer your first question in three parts.    We\nwill discuss   first the legislative history     and proper\nconstruction of section 67 of article XVI of the Texas\nConstitution.  Then we will specify those retirement    plans\nor systems in which appraisal districts   are authorized   by\nTexas statute to participate.  Then we will discuss  whether\nappraisal districts have imnlied authority to create    Iocal\nsystems, authority analogous to that explicitly conferred by\nV.T.C.S. articles 6243k and 62283 on incorporated cities and\ncounties, respectively.\n                              I\n\n   ::Section 67 of'article         XVI of    the Texas   Constitution\nprovides:in pertinent part:\n\n           (a) General Provisions.

A county or a\nspecial district       exercises only such powers as have been\nexpressly       delegated  to it by the constitution     or the\nlegislature       or which exist by clear and       unquestioned\nimplication.

In Bvrd v. CitV of Dallas,     6  S.W.Zd 738  (Tex.\n1928); the Texas Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality\nof a statute authorizing pensions   for city police and fire\ndepartment personnel.~ Those challenging the statute   argued\nthat the granting of pensions to persons who were no longer\nemployed by a political     subdivision  violated  the state\nconstitutional prohibition against granting public funds for\nprivate purposes.   The court disagreed, holding that such a\nbenefit constituted   part of the compensation     for which\nemployees contracted.\n\n     This case stands for the proposition      that a statute\npermitting the ~creation of a pension system does not violate\nthe constitutional    prohibition  against granting     public\n                                          (Footnote Continued)\n\n\n\n\n                               p. 6022\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 12    (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\nlocal retirement and disability systems, apparently  without\nrestriction.  Indeed, it is argued, in the words of one\nbrief submitted   in connection with this request,      that\nziyf,i;a; districts have authority to create plans \"as they\n           We disagree for several reasons.\n\n     First, statutes are not to be construed in such a way\nas to impute to the legislature a foolish, useless, or vain\nthing. State ex rel. Childress v. School Trustees of Shelbv\nCounty, 239 S.W.Zd 777 (Tex. 1951); Dovalina v. Albert, 409\nS.W.2d 616 (Tex. Civ. App. - Amarillo 1966, writ ref'd\nn.r.e.). The governing bodies of counties,        cities   (both\nhome-rule and general law),   school   districts,  and   special\ndistricts are empowered, either by the constitution or by\nstatute, to %ompensatem     employees.    If a conferral      of\nexplicit authority   to the governing    body of a political\nsubdivision to llcompensatell public employees      necessarily\nentailed the implied authority to offer those employees      any\nretirement plan that the governing body saw fit, then the\nlegislature's enactments of the statutes set forth in Part I\nof this opinion were useless, superfluous acts. Indeed, the\nlegislature's adoption of all of those statutes set forth\noriginally as title 109 of the,Revised      Civil Statutes    of\nTexas, recodified    in 1981 as title 1lOB and           finally\nrecodified in 1989 as title 8 of the Government            Code,\nstatutes dating back to 1909 and 'through 1989, would have\nbeen superfluous.   While some~persons may have assumed     that\npolitical subdivisions have the implied authority to offer\nto their employees' any retirement plan that they so. choose,\nlegislatures going back to almost the turn of the century\nevidently have not.\n\n     Second, the argument that appraisal districts have the\nimplied authority to offer their employees any retirement\nplan that they so choose would produce an absurd result.    It\nwould mean that, while      counties,  cities,   and    school\ndistricts are governed by and limited to those statutes that\nthe legislature   has enacted over the years         regarding\nretirement  plans, appraisal districts    have unrestricted\npower to do whatever they want. Moreover,      it would also\n\n\n(Footnot;aCoiziued)\nfunds:             not stand for the proposition ~that         a\npolitical subdivision has the implied authority to create      a\nlocal pension system.\n\n\n\n\n                               p. 6023\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 13    (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\nmean that those safeguards and protections         designed   to\nvouchsafe the interests of participating employees and those\nlimitations upon inves'tments set forth both in section 67 of\narticle XVI and in the statutes that authorize the creation\nof various pension plans or retirement systems would not be\napplicable, since those provisions govern plans and systems\nenacted by general      law.       e.  a     Attorney   General\nOpinions MW-570, MW-506      (198;:; &-ii2    (1980) (opinions\nconstruing statutory limitations on investments designed      to\nafford protection  to participants).       Nor is it at all\ncertain whether retirement plans created absent explicit\nstatutory authority would be protected under the Texas Trust\nAct, which governs the administration of private        trusts.\nSee CreDs v.

We know of no reason why\nthe legislature would intend such a result.12\n\n     And third, interpretation by implication is permissible\nonly when   it is necessary;        the argument that a special\ndistrict has tinlied authority to 'do..athing\"is        inapposite\nin an instance in which it is given specific'authcrity to do\n                    , Cre a r v -Hidala; Countv Water Imorove-\n                      283aS:W.    ‘151  (Tex.

Indeed, invoking a common rule of statutory construc-\ntion, 'it could well be argued that those statutory plans or\nsystems enacted'by the legislature should be read to exclude\nany others.    See Weaver v. ,Robison, 268 S:W. 133          (Tex.\n1924); Poster v.

As we pointed out in Part II of\nthis opinion,     special districts,        including    appraisal\ndistricts, that are not authorized explicitly         to create a\nlocal retirement system may choose to do one or more of the\n\n\n\n      12.  For this same reason we reject the argument  that\nall political .-subdivisions have the implied authority   to\ncreate whatever pension plan or retirement system that they\nso choose and that all of the constitutional amendments  and\nstatutes enacted by the legislature are merely   limitations\non that implied authority.\n\n\n\n\n                                p. 6024\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 14   (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\nfollowing: participate   in the federal Social      Security\nsystem, participate in, the state-wide County and District\nRetirement System, or adopt one of the deferred compensation\nplans authorized by statute. We need not strain to find an\nimplied power when the legislature has conferred   specific,\nthough limited, powers.\n\n     It is also argued that Attorney General Opinions   M-836\n(1971) and WW-215 (1957) and Lower-Colorado River Auth. v.\nChemical Bank & Trust Co., 185 S.W.2d 461 (Tex.

We think\nthat reliance on these authorities is misplaced.\n\n     Attorney   General Opinion M-836 concluded      that\" the'\nSabine River Authority had the implied power to enter into a\ndeferred  compensation   and pension plan based upon its\nexplicit authority to employ and fix the compensation      for\nthose executives and employees as is necessary to carry out\nthe functions and duties of the authority.      That opinion\nrelied upon :v.;                                           151\nS.W.2d 570 (Tex. 1941), m          154 S.W.2d 659 (Tex. ,Civ.\nAPP. - Fort Worth    1941, no writ) [hereinafter. Friedman],\nHvrd V.   Citv of Dallas.      6 S.W. 2d 738      (Tex. 1928)\n[hereinafter m],     and Attorney General Opinion WW-215. The\nlatter opinion also relied upon Friedman in support,of ' the\nproposition   that the Port ~Isabel-San Benito Navigation\nDistrict had the implied power to provide certain benefits,'~\nincluding pension benefits, to its employees.\n\n     For three reasons, we do not think that the two court\nopinions are controlling.    First, both Friedman   and, &&\nconcerned   whether    specific statutes    enacted by    the\nlegislature, one authorizing   the creation of pensions   for\ncity police  and firemen and the other creating      a Texas\nEmployment Compensation Fund, violated specific provisions\nof the Texas Constitution.   In both cases, the Texas Supreme\nCourt upheld the challenged statutes, concluding that the\nbenefits that each provided should be considered a part of\nthe compensation    that employees   earned, rather than a\ngratuity conferred. Neither case stands for the proposition\nthat a political subdivision has any implied power.\n\n\n     Second, the holdings  of these two opinions cannot be\nreconciled with other attorney general opinions, issued both\nprior and subsequent to the issuance to these opinions, that\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 15   (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\ndo not find any implied authority to create or participate\nin retirement systems, absent explicit statutory     authority.\nSee, e.a., Attorney     General Opinions H-903   (1976); H-604\n(1975); C-581     (1966); WE-283   (1957).   Nor can they be\nreconciled with those opinions that strictly           construe\nauthority conferred     and find no implied power to provide\nbenefits generally,     absent explicit statutory    authority.\nSee e.a     Attorney   General Opinions JR-887 (1988); JR-543\n(1986); ‘;M-406   (1985) ; JR-143 (1984); ME-592 (1982); H-535\n(1975); WW-1373 (1962).\n\n     Third, the holdings of these two opinions cannot be\nreconciled with the strict construction     evidently   given\nsection 62 of article XVI.    When it was adopted in 1946,\nsubsection (b) of section 62 provided in relevant part .that\n\"[E]ach county shall have the right to provide       for and\nadminister a Retirement,  Disability and Death Compensation\nFund for the appointive    officers and employees     of the\ncounty . . . .It The subsection made the creation of such a\nfund contingent  upon the approval of a majority      of the\nqualified voters of the a county.\n\n     In 1958 the voters rejected an amendment to section     62\nof article XVI of the Texas Constitution      that would have\nexpanded the scope of the section to include officers       and\nemployees of precincts.'   S.J.R. 6, Acts 1957, 55 Leg., at\n1631. Even more, significantly, in 1962 the voters of Texas\ndefeated an amendment to subsection (b) to expand its scope\nto include    \"[e]ach county       nd anv    other    oolitical\nsubdivision of this State.\"      Ha&R.   36, Acts   1961, 57th\nWJ., at 1314 (emphasis added). Subsection (c) of section\n62 was added in.1966, which authorized the legislature       to\nprovide a pension plan \"for all the officers and employees\nof a county or other nolitical     subdivision of the State.\"\nS.J.R. 4, Acts 1965, 59th Leg., at 2190. It was only after\nthis amendment    was    adopted    and   pursuant    to   this\nauthorization that the legislature      created   in 1967 the\nstatewide County and District Retirement System. Acts 1967,\n60th Leg., ch. 127, at 240 (codified originally at V.T.C.S.\narticle 6228g and now codified at subtitle F of title 8 of\nthe Government Code). Clearly,,neither the legislature that\nproposed the 1958 and 1962 amendments     nor the voters   that\ndefeated them assumed that the implied power to create\npension systems existed; if they had, the amendments      would\nhave been superfluous.\n\n     Both Attorney   General   Opinions M-836   and    WE-215\ncontained faulty reasoning and relied upon authorities   that\n\n\n\n\n                               p. 6026\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 16    (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\ndo not support the proposition for which they were cited.\nAccordingly, Attorney General Opinions M-836 and WW-215 are\nhereby overruled.\n\n     In m,    the court of civil appeals considered,   inter\na,    whether the LCRA had the implied power to increase the\ncompensation that it paid its officers and employees by four\npercent and then set aside the four percent in a segregated\nfund for the purpose of providing   a pension or retirement\nplan for those officers and employees.  The court held that\nit had the implied power, based in part upon its explicit\nstatutory power to compensate  employees.  For two reasons,\nwe conclude that m    does not control your question.\n\n     First, keeping in mind'.that the purpose of the LdXA,\nwhich is in part to provide electric power to consumers   in\nmuch the same way that'an investor-owned utility does, it is\nsignificant that the court employed the following  rationale\nto support its conclusion:\n\n        While designated      and    classified          a   ..,\n        governmental    agency and body politiz        and\n       corporate;- the Authority's' functions          and\n        activities   partake, in large measure         the\n        nature     and      characteristics,        within\n        legislative     restrictions,    of    a     large\n        industrial   enterprise,    rather than of       a\n        strictly governmental .function. It has 'no\n        power' to    levy    taxes,\" enact     laws    nor\n        ordinances, as a city has; and its efficient~\n        functioning depends in large measure on the\n        sound judgment and good business management\n        of its Board of Directors.      They have    large\n        control over the operation of its properties,\n        and the income to be derived therefrom, which\n        constitute the only source of revenue to meet\n        its obligations.       Of    necessity    matters\n        relating thereto must be left in             large\n        measure to their judgment,       experience    and\n        discretion;    and obviously     could not      be\n        prescribed ,in detail\"by law.\n\n           . . . .\n\n            Retirement  pay from funds    ,~accumulated\n        through the co-operative efforts of employer\n        and    employee   are   now  well-established\n        business practices    among practically    all\n\n\n\n\n                               p. 6027\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 17    (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\n        large industrial enterprises;   and are being\n        increasingly applied by national, state and\n        municipal governments.  Typical instances are\n        civil service employees, postal     employees,\n        fire and police employees, etc.\n\n185 S.W.2d at 467.\n\n     The court clearly felt that the LCRA was not simply a\npolitical  subdivision;  indeed, the Texas Supreme Court\ndecision that affirmed the w       judgment of the court of\nappeals held for the first time that the LCM was tax exempt\nfrom ad valorem taxes as a political subdivision.   Whatever\nelse may be said,about   appraisal districts,  they are not\nanalogous to industrial enterprises.\n\n     We acknowledge     that the public policy     reasons that\nimpelled the court to conclude that the LCRA had an implied\npower to create pension systems can apply equally to the\ncreation.of   pension. systems   for every sort of political\nsubdivision:   namely that such plans may encourage employees\nto remain so employed,~,with the result that there is less\nrnzloyee turn-over,     better service to the general     public\n     ultimately less cost to the public. But it needs to be\nrem&bered that, at the time that m         was handed down, no\nother sort of pension     system or plan wasp available to the\nemployees of'the LCRL       An d it should also be remembered\nthat the court itself admitted that, while,pension       systems\nfor employees      had    become   nwell-established    business\npractices\"   among     practically    all   large     industrial\nenterprises,\" it was only l@increasingly applied\" to public\nemployees. The force of the rationale       that impelled that\ncourt to create an implied power in 1945 is greatly weakened\nin 1990 in the face of the fact that the legislature\nexplicitly has made provision for the retirement benefits of\nspecial district employees.\n\n     Second, for the reasons set forth in the discussion\nabove regarding  Vompensationl'  and implied power,   it is\nobvious that the legislature has not assumed that, whatever\nthe ICRA might have implied power to do, all special\ndistricts have identical implied powers.   If such were the\ncase, again, virtually all of the legislation enacted     in\nthis area would be unnecessary and superfluous.    a     may\nstand for the proposition   that the ICRA has the, implied\npower to create a pension system for its officers        and\nemployees: it does not stand for the proposition        that\nspecial districts generally are so empowered.\n\n\n\n\n                               P- 6028\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 18   (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\n     Instructive in this regard is Attorney General    Opinion\nV-569 (1948), in which the state auditor asked whether       a\nlist of 31 special districts were authorized to participate\nin the Employees Retirement System of Texas.       All of the\ndistricts were created pursuant to section 59 of article XVI\nof the Texas Constitution.   The opinion discusses the &Q&\ncase and sets forth essentially the same quotation set forth\nabove, describing  the LCRA8s functions and power,      before\nconcluding  that its employees were not authorized          to\nparticipate in the Employees Retirement System, based upon\nthe statutory  definitions  of l'employeell and tldepartment\"\nthat govern participation   in the retirement    system.    In\nspite of the fact that the LCRA had been held to be an\nagency of the state in b $       lo ad\nMcGraw, 83 S.W.2d 629 (Tez. 1935)      the opinion   concluded\nthat LCRA employees were not ~empl~yees    of the State\"   for\npurposes of the retirement system.     Reasoning by analogy,\nthe opinion held that      employees   of conservation     and\nreclamation districts were not llemployees of the State\"   for\npurposes of the retirement system either. Curiously,       the\nopinion referred to the \"apparent\" authority of the LCRA to\ncreate its own retirement system, but failed to state that\nconservation and reclamation districts    possessed the same\npower:\n\n           We note here that from reading Lower\n        Colorado River Authority v. Chemical Bank and\n        Trust Co., supra, the L.C.R.A. apparently has\n        its own retirement system. In any event, the\n        employees of this particular district would\n        be precluded  from membership  in the system\n        afforded by    H. B.    168 [the    Bmployees\n        Retirement System of Texas], by reason of\n        Section l.c., of H. B. 168 which defines\n        'employee.'\n\n           We are, therefore, of the opinion that the\n        employees of the conservation and reclamation\n        districts  named in your reguest are not\n        eligible  for  membership   in the Employees\n        Retirement System of Texas.\n\nId. at 7.\n\n     The reason for the apparent failure of the legislature\nspecifically  to provide   for the inclusion    of  special\ndistricts in the statewide plan for counties until     1967\nprobably stems from the fact that the proliferation      of\n\n\n\n\n                              p. 6029\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 19    (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\nspecial districts    in Texas is a comparatively      recent\nphenomenon.  As recently as February 1959, there were an\nestimated 524 special districts   in Texas.   Of these,  115\nwere authorized by local law and 409 were created under some\n13 general   laws   governing water    districts.   See   w.\nThrombley,  Special Districts and Authorities     in Texas,\nInstitute of Public Affairs, University of Texas at Austin\n(1959). By 1979 there were over 420 special districts     in\nHarris County alone. We think it significant that in a\ntreatise on public employee retirement in Texas written   in\n1955, no mention is made of any implied authority of special\ndistricts to create local pension systems, nor is mention\nmade of the LcRA case. See Swanson       8 Miskell,   Public\nEmployment Retirement in Texas, Institute of Public Affairs,\nUniversity of Texas at Austin    (1955). Indeed, the .only\nreference to any so*     of retirement  system for specials-\ndistricts in this 1955 treatise     is the federal Social\nSecurity program. Id. at Table XIV, part III, at p. 91;\n\n     Threes other arguments have been adduced, each, relying\nupon misconstrued    ore ~misunderstood specific    statutory\nprovisions, in support of the \"implied power\" theory.' The\nfirst maintains   that the facts that participation in the\nCounty and District Retirement System is voluntary and that\nthe System's board must approve any such participation by a\nspecial district, Gov't Code 0 842.001(c), necessarily   mean\nthat special districts have the implied authority to create.\ntheir own local pension systems.\n\n     This argument  is faulty in two respects.       One; it\nignores the authority conferred by statute       to    create\ndeferred compensation   plans and to participate      in the\nfederal Social Security program.      And two,   it wrongly\npresupposes that a retirement   plan has to be offered to\nemployees in the first instance. In other words, it assumes\nthat the only choice a special district has is either to\nparticipate in the County and District Retirement System or\nto create a local pension system analogous        to    those\nauthorized by V.T.C.S. articles 62283 and 6243k.\n\n     In fact, neither federal nor state law requires a local\npolitical subdivision to create a pension plan. The federal\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.\n§§ 1001 et sea.     (llERISAn) does not ,govern local political\nsubdivisions.     Attorney  General Opinion H-618     (1975); 29\nU.S.C. 5 1003(b).     And no provision in state law requires\nlocal political      subdivisions,   except  independent   school\n\n\n\n\n                                p. 6030\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 20   (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\ndistricts, to make participation   in a retirement   program\navailable to its employees: participation is voluntary.\n\n     For example, in Attorney General Opinion H-1122 (1978),\nthis office held that a municipality that chooses to exempt\nitself from the operation   of V.T.C.S. article 6243e, which\ngoverns retirement systems for volunteer fire departments,\nis not required   to create an alternate retirement   system.\nIn Attorney General Opinion H-903     (1976), in answer to a\nquestion   asking whether employees of a hospital       whose\nadministration had been taken over by the county were\nauthorized to establish their own pension plan, this office\nheld that employees became automatic members of County    and\nDistrict Retirement    System if the county was       already\nparticipating in the system or the county could elect to\ndiscontinue participation in the statewide system and create\na local one pursuant to V.T.C.S.    article 62285. No other\nalternative was available. Thus, in an instance in which a\nspecial district is not authorized explicitly by statute   to\ncreate a pension   plan, it may only do one or more of the\nfollowing: adopt a'deferred    compensation plan pursuant -to\nstatute, participate in the federal Social Security program,\nagain by statute, or participate in the County and District\nSystem. Or it may offer nothing at all.\n\n     The next argument misconstruing     specific  statutory\nprovisions  asserts that the existence     of_ what .,is now\ncodified as section 842.006 in the Government Code amounts\nto a recognition by the legislature that special districts\nhave the implied authority to create local pension  systems.\nThat section provides:\n\n           A local pension   system established   for\n        employees of a subdivision may merge into the\n        [County and District] retirement   system on\n        conditions  prescribed   by the    board   of\n        trustees [of the County and District Retire-\n        ment System].\n\nSection 842.006 is the amended version of what originally\nwas denominated  sections 10 and 11 in V.T.C.S.   article\n6228g.\n\n     Subsection (c) of section 62 article XVI, which created\nthe County and District Retirement   System, authorized  the\nlegislature to provide for a voluntary merger of subdivision\n(b) \"local systems\" into the state system. Pursuant to this\nauthorization, section 10 of article 6228g, V.T.C.S.,    was\n\n\n\n\n                              p. 6031\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 21 (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\nenacted to govern the merger of a .local county system into\nthe newly-created   state-wide  system.

We disagree.      If, at the time that this section was\nenacted, there were no other subdivisions that had explicit\nstatutory authority to create pension systems to which this\nsection could have applied, this argument might be more\ncompelling.

Instead, it misapplies a rule of statutory\nconstruction.   It is urged that, because the staff of the\nState Property Tax Board, in its published newsletters  and\npamphlets, declared that appraisal districts were empowered\nto create local pension     systems other than those whose\ncreation   is specifically    authorized  by statute,  this\nadministrative construction   should be given great weight.\nWe do not find this argument convincing.\n\n     It is an accepted ,principle of statutory  construction\nthat the construction   placed upon a statute by the agency\ncharged with its administration is entitled to great weight,\nEx narte Roloff,    510 S.W.2d 913   (Tex. 1974): State v.:\nAransas Dock and Channel Co., 365 S.W.2d 220 (Tex.

But in this instance. the\napplication of this 'principle is undermined    because  the\nadministrative construction made by the staff of the State\nProperty Tax Board has not been consistent.\n\n      As early as 1983, the pamphlet published by the agency\n entitled \"Appraisal Board Manual: A Handbook for Countywide\n Appraisal District  Directors\" provided     specifically  that\n,appraisal districts could participate   in either the County\n and District Retirement System or a private retirement plan.\n Id. at 19-20. But even earlier, in an issue of the agency's\n monthly newsletter   ?3tatement,\" published   in August  1980,\n the agency  indicated that the only options available       to\n appraisal districts were participation in the federal Social\n Security program, the County and District Retirement System,\n or both. Id. at 9.\n\n     Moreover,  the  application of  this principle          of\nconstruction has been invoked in instances in which          an\n\n\n (Footnote Continued)\n\n   This opinion relates only to the acceptability of the\n   form of the plan under the Internal Revenue Code.  It\n   is not an opinion of the effect of other Federal or\n   local statutes.

In this instance, the State Property\nTax Board has no duties relative to any of the statutes\ngoverning   the creation of pension    systems or deferred\ncompensation plans. Without regard to either the skill or\nknowledge of the staff of the State Property Tax Board,\ntheir administrative   construction  of these statutes    is\nentitled   to no greater weight than the administrative\nconstructions of these same provisions by the staff of, for\nexample, the Texas Water Commission or the Department     of\nPublic Safety.\n\n     We therefore conclude that appraisal districts have no\nimplied authority, absent specific statcltory authority,   to\ncreate local pension systems. Accordingly, we conclude taat\nappraisal districts may participate in the following: .the\nfederal Social Security program pursuant   to article   695g,\nV.T.C.S., the County and District Retirement System pursuant\nto chapter    842 of the Government    Code, and    deferred\ncompensation   plans authorized   by article   6252-3e    and\n6252-3f,,V.T.C.S.   (to be superseded by article    6252-3g,\nV.T.C.S., effective September 1, 1990). Appraisal districts\nhave no implied authority to create local retirement systems\nanalogous to those authorized by articles V.T.C.S. 6243k and\n62283, which incorporated cities and counties, respectively,\nmay create. We turn finally to your second question.\n\n\n\n     You wish to know what        will be the income       tax\nconsequences to individual appraisal district employees    and\nthe proper method of disbursing funds held in any retirement\nplans in the event that any plans already       in place were\nentered into improperly. The Texas Association of Appraisal\nDistricts conducted a survey of its members that     indicated\nthat, among the 254 counties of the state, 124 appraisal\ndistricts offer \"local retirement   plans.\"   If an appraisal\ndistrict created a local plan that was not authorized       by\nstatute, the apparent varieties as to contracts        entered\ninto, benefits    offered, system or plan administration,\nrestrictions   as to    participation,   years required    for\nvesting,   employee contributions,    and appraisal   district\ncontributions are so great that an attempt would necessarily\nrequire us to answer hypothetical questions     and engage  in\nfact-finding, neither of which is permitted in the opinion\nprocess. Accordingly,    we decline to answer your second\nquestion.\n\n\n\n\n                              p. 6037\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 27        (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\n     We are not unmindful of the possible consequences   of\nour decision, but the consequences of legal interpretation\ndo not control.     Regarding  a matter of constitutional\ninterpretation, the Texas Supreme Court declared in Kov v.\nScheider, 218 S.W. 479 (Tex. 1920):\n\n        No matter how far-reaching    and disastrous\n        would be the consequences . . . we would not\n        decline to make the declaration if such was\n        believed  to be the true intent of       the\n        language of the Constitution.\n\nQuoted in Director of the DeD't of Asric. and Env't v.\nPrintina Indus.

We are no less bound by this principle.\n\n     The situation with which we are here confronted is not\naltogether unprecedented.   When the legislature was apprised\nof the fact that many appraisal districts in the state had\nentered into long-term   lease agreements for the rental of\noffice space or entered into contracts for the construction\nof buildings or the purchase of real property without     the\nstatutory authority to do'so, 'it enacted section 6.051 of\nthe Tax Code to so empower those appraisal districts.

Box 12068                 (RQ-1778)\nAustin, Texas. .78711\n\nDear Senator Parmer:\n\n     We understand  you to ask essentially   two questions.\nFirst, you ask us to specify the types of retirement   plans\nthat an appraisal district may offer its employees.  Second,\nyou wish to know what will be the income tax consequences to\nindividual appraisal   district  employees  and the proper\nmethod of disbursing funds held in any retirement plans    in\nthe event that any plans already in place were entered   into\nimproperly.\n\n        Your opinion 'request is prompted.by. the issuance of\nAttorney General Opinion JM-1068 (1989), which concluded\nthat appraisal     districts were without authority     to enter\ninto certain contracts providing         retirement   plans   for\nappraisal district     employees.    We construed   the question\nsubmitted in that request to ask whether            an appraisal\ndistrict had the authority      to create a local retirement\nsystem, authority similar to that conferred on incorporated\ncities and towns by V.T.C.S.      article 6243k and on counties\nby V.T.C.S.     article 62283.     Because no statute     confers\nexplicit authority     on appraisal    districts  or, for that\nmatter,    on any other sort of.special.district to create such\na local system, we concluded          that no such      authority\nexisted.1 The opinion apparently       has been misconstrued   to\n\n\n\n      1. This opinion should not be construed to call into\nquestion the legitimacy of a plan authorized by special law\ncreating a special district.\n\n\n\n\n                                P. 6012\n\fHonorable Hugh Panner - Page 2       (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\nhold that subsections   (b), (c), and (d) of secti.on 67 of\narticle XVI of the Texas Constitution       sets forth the\nexclusive   list of the retirement plans that political\nsubdivisions may provide for their employees.   However,  we\ndid not so hold; rather, we held that there was no statutory\nauthority to create the sort of system about which we\nunderstood the reguestor to inquire.\n\n     We will answer your first question in three parts.    We\nwill discuss   first the legislative history     and proper\nconstruction of section 67 of article XVI of the Texas\nConstitution.  Then we will specify those retirement    plans\nor systems in which appraisal districts   are authorized   by\nTexas statute to participate.  Then we will discuss  whether\nappraisal districts have imnlied authority to create    Iocal\nsystems, authority analogous to that explicitly conferred by\nV.T.C.S. articles 6243k and 62283 on incorporated cities and\ncounties, respectively.\n                              I\n\n   ::Section 67 of'article         XVI of    the Texas   Constitution\nprovides:in pertinent part:\n\n           (a) General Provisions.

For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, pension\nplans, profit-sharing plans, stock bonus plans, as well as\ndeferred compensation plans under state law, are considered\n\"deferred compensation\" plans.\n\n      7.

A\n        member is eligible for retirement benefits if\n        he is 65 years old or older, or he is 60\n        years old but less than 65 years old and has\n                                          (Footnote Continued)\n\n\n\n\n                              p. 6020\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 10      (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\nby V.T.C.S. article 6228j10, which were enacted pursuant  to\nsubsection (c)(l) of section 67 of article XVI of the Texas\nConstitution.

Neither case stands for the proposition\nthat a political subdivision has any implied power.\n\n\n     Second, the holdings  of these two opinions cannot be\nreconciled with other attorney general opinions, issued both\nprior and subsequent to the issuance to these opinions, that\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 15   (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\ndo not find any implied authority to create or participate\nin retirement systems, absent explicit statutory     authority.\nSee, e.a., Attorney     General Opinions H-903   (1976); H-604\n(1975); C-581     (1966); WE-283   (1957).   Nor can they be\nreconciled with those opinions that strictly           construe\nauthority conferred     and find no implied power to provide\nbenefits generally,     absent explicit statutory    authority.\nSee e.a     Attorney   General Opinions JR-887 (1988); JR-543\n(1986); ‘;M-406   (1985) ; JR-143 (1984); ME-592 (1982); H-535\n(1975); WW-1373 (1962).\n\n     Third, the holdings of these two opinions cannot be\nreconciled with the strict construction     evidently   given\nsection 62 of article XVI.

Clearly,,neither the legislature that\nproposed the 1958 and 1962 amendments     nor the voters   that\ndefeated them assumed that the implied power to create\npension systems existed; if they had, the amendments      would\nhave been superfluous.\n\n     Both Attorney   General   Opinions M-836   and    WE-215\ncontained faulty reasoning and relied upon authorities   that\n\n\n\n\n                               p. 6026\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 16    (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\ndo not support the proposition for which they were cited.\nAccordingly, Attorney General Opinions M-836 and WW-215 are\nhereby overruled.\n\n     In m,    the court of civil appeals considered,   inter\na,    whether the LCRA had the implied power to increase the\ncompensation that it paid its officers and employees by four\npercent and then set aside the four percent in a segregated\nfund for the purpose of providing   a pension or retirement\nplan for those officers and employees.  The court held that\nit had the implied power, based in part upon its explicit\nstatutory power to compensate  employees.  For two reasons,\nwe conclude that m    does not control your question.\n\n     First, keeping in mind'.that the purpose of the LdXA,\nwhich is in part to provide electric power to consumers   in\nmuch the same way that'an investor-owned utility does, it is\nsignificant that the court employed the following  rationale\nto support its conclusion:\n\n        While designated      and    classified          a   ..,\n        governmental    agency and body politiz        and\n       corporate;- the Authority's' functions          and\n        activities   partake, in large measure         the\n        nature     and      characteristics,        within\n        legislative     restrictions,    of    a     large\n        industrial   enterprise,    rather than of       a\n        strictly governmental .function. It has 'no\n        power' to    levy    taxes,\" enact     laws    nor\n        ordinances, as a city has; and its efficient~\n        functioning depends in large measure on the\n        sound judgment and good business management\n        of its Board of Directors.      They have    large\n        control over the operation of its properties,\n        and the income to be derived therefrom, which\n        constitute the only source of revenue to meet\n        its obligations.       Of    necessity    matters\n        relating thereto must be left in             large\n        measure to their judgment,       experience    and\n        discretion;    and obviously     could not      be\n        prescribed ,in detail\"by law.\n\n           . . . .\n\n            Retirement  pay from funds    ,~accumulated\n        through the co-operative efforts of employer\n        and    employee   are   now  well-established\n        business practices    among practically    all\n\n\n\n\n                               p. 6027\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 17    (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\n        large industrial enterprises;   and are being\n        increasingly applied by national, state and\n        municipal governments.  Typical instances are\n        civil service employees, postal     employees,\n        fire and police employees, etc.\n\n185 S.W.2d at 467.\n\n     The court clearly felt that the LCRA was not simply a\npolitical  subdivision;  indeed, the Texas Supreme Court\ndecision that affirmed the w       judgment of the court of\nappeals held for the first time that the LCM was tax exempt\nfrom ad valorem taxes as a political subdivision.   Whatever\nelse may be said,about   appraisal districts,  they are not\nanalogous to industrial enterprises.\n\n     We acknowledge     that the public policy     reasons that\nimpelled the court to conclude that the LCRA had an implied\npower to create pension systems can apply equally to the\ncreation.of   pension. systems   for every sort of political\nsubdivision:   namely that such plans may encourage employees\nto remain so employed,~,with the result that there is less\nrnzloyee turn-over,     better service to the general     public\n     ultimately less cost to the public. But it needs to be\nrem&bered that, at the time that m         was handed down, no\nother sort of pension     system or plan wasp available to the\nemployees of'the LCRL       An d it should also be remembered\nthat the court itself admitted that, while,pension       systems\nfor employees      had    become   nwell-established    business\npractices\"   among     practically    all   large     industrial\nenterprises,\" it was only l@increasingly applied\" to public\nemployees. The force of the rationale       that impelled that\ncourt to create an implied power in 1945 is greatly weakened\nin 1990 in the face of the fact that the legislature\nexplicitly has made provision for the retirement benefits of\nspecial district employees.\n\n     Second, for the reasons set forth in the discussion\nabove regarding  Vompensationl'  and implied power,   it is\nobvious that the legislature has not assumed that, whatever\nthe ICRA might have implied power to do, all special\ndistricts have identical implied powers.   If such were the\ncase, again, virtually all of the legislation enacted     in\nthis area would be unnecessary and superfluous.    a     may\nstand for the proposition   that the ICRA has the, implied\npower to create a pension system for its officers        and\nemployees: it does not stand for the proposition        that\nspecial districts generally are so empowered.\n\n\n\n\n                               P- 6028\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 18   (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\n     Instructive in this regard is Attorney General    Opinion\nV-569 (1948), in which the state auditor asked whether       a\nlist of 31 special districts were authorized to participate\nin the Employees Retirement System of Texas.       All of the\ndistricts were created pursuant to section 59 of article XVI\nof the Texas Constitution.   The opinion discusses the &Q&\ncase and sets forth essentially the same quotation set forth\nabove, describing  the LCRA8s functions and power,      before\nconcluding  that its employees were not authorized          to\nparticipate in the Employees Retirement System, based upon\nthe statutory  definitions  of l'employeell and tldepartment\"\nthat govern participation   in the retirement    system.    In\nspite of the fact that the LCRA had been held to be an\nagency of the state in b $       lo ad\nMcGraw, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3936044\"><a href=\"/opinion/4169033/lower-col-river-auth-v-mccraw/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tez. 1935)      the opinion   concluded\nthat LCRA employees were not ~empl~yees    of the State\"   for\npurposes of the retirement system.     Reasoning by analogy,\nthe opinion held that      employees   of conservation     and\nreclamation districts were not llemployees of the State\"   for\npurposes of the retirement system either. Curiously,       the\nopinion referred to the \"apparent\" authority of the LCRA to\ncreate its own retirement system, but failed to state that\nconservation and reclamation districts    possessed the same\npower:\n\n           We note here that from reading Lower\n        Colorado River Authority v. Chemical Bank and\n        Trust Co., supra, the L.C.R.A. apparently has\n        its own retirement system. In any event, the\n        employees of this particular district would\n        be precluded  from membership  in the system\n        afforded by    H. B.    168 [the    Bmployees\n        Retirement System of Texas], by reason of\n        Section l.c., of H. B. 168 which defines\n        'employee.'\n\n           We are, therefore, of the opinion that the\n        employees of the conservation and reclamation\n        districts  named in your reguest are not\n        eligible  for  membership   in the Employees\n        Retirement System of Texas.\n\nId. at 7.\n\n     The reason for the apparent failure of the legislature\nspecifically  to provide   for the inclusion    of  special\ndistricts in the statewide plan for counties until     1967\nprobably stems from the fact that the proliferation      of\n\n\n\n\n                              p. 6029\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 19    (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\nspecial districts    in Texas is a comparatively      recent\nphenomenon.  As recently as February 1959, there were an\nestimated 524 special districts   in Texas.   Of these,  115\nwere authorized by local law and 409 were created under some\n13 general   laws   governing water    districts.   See   w.\nThrombley,  Special Districts and Authorities     in Texas,\nInstitute of Public Affairs, University of Texas at Austin\n(1959). By 1979 there were over 420 special districts     in\nHarris County alone. We think it significant that in a\ntreatise on public employee retirement in Texas written   in\n1955, no mention is made of any implied authority of special\ndistricts to create local pension systems, nor is mention\nmade of the LcRA case. See Swanson       8 Miskell,   Public\nEmployment Retirement in Texas, Institute of Public Affairs,\nUniversity of Texas at Austin    (1955). Indeed, the .only\nreference to any so*     of retirement  system for specials-\ndistricts in this 1955 treatise     is the federal Social\nSecurity program. Id. at Table XIV, part III, at p. 91;\n\n     Threes other arguments have been adduced, each, relying\nupon misconstrued    ore ~misunderstood specific    statutory\nprovisions, in support of the \"implied power\" theory.' The\nfirst maintains   that the facts that participation in the\nCounty and District Retirement System is voluntary and that\nthe System's board must approve any such participation by a\nspecial district, Gov't Code 0 842.001(c), necessarily   mean\nthat special districts have the implied authority to create.\ntheir own local pension systems.\n\n     This argument  is faulty in two respects.       One; it\nignores the authority conferred by statute       to    create\ndeferred compensation   plans and to participate      in the\nfederal Social Security program.      And two,   it wrongly\npresupposes that a retirement   plan has to be offered to\nemployees in the first instance. In other words, it assumes\nthat the only choice a special district has is either to\nparticipate in the County and District Retirement System or\nto create a local pension system analogous        to    those\nauthorized by V.T.C.S. articles 62283 and 6243k.\n\n     In fact, neither federal nor state law requires a local\npolitical subdivision to create a pension plan. The federal\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.\n§§ 1001 et sea.     (llERISAn) does not ,govern local political\nsubdivisions.     Attorney  General Opinion H-618     (1975); 29\nU.S.C. 5 1003(b).     And no provision in state law requires\nlocal political      subdivisions,   except  independent   school\n\n\n\n\n                                p. 6030\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 20   (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\ndistricts, to make participation   in a retirement   program\navailable to its employees: participation is voluntary.\n\n     For example, in Attorney General Opinion H-1122 (1978),\nthis office held that a municipality that chooses to exempt\nitself from the operation   of V.T.C.S. article 6243e, which\ngoverns retirement systems for volunteer fire departments,\nis not required   to create an alternate retirement   system.\nIn Attorney General Opinion H-903     (1976), in answer to a\nquestion   asking whether employees of a hospital       whose\nadministration had been taken over by the county were\nauthorized to establish their own pension plan, this office\nheld that employees became automatic members of County    and\nDistrict Retirement    System if the county was       already\nparticipating in the system or the county could elect to\ndiscontinue participation in the statewide system and create\na local one pursuant to V.T.C.S.    article 62285. No other\nalternative was available. Thus, in an instance in which a\nspecial district is not authorized explicitly by statute   to\ncreate a pension   plan, it may only do one or more of the\nfollowing: adopt a'deferred    compensation plan pursuant -to\nstatute, participate in the federal Social Security program,\nagain by statute, or participate in the County and District\nSystem. Or it may offer nothing at all.\n\n     The next argument misconstruing     specific  statutory\nprovisions  asserts that the existence     of_ what .,is now\ncodified as section 842.006 in the Government Code amounts\nto a recognition by the legislature that special districts\nhave the implied authority to create local pension  systems.\nThat section provides:\n\n           A local pension   system established   for\n        employees of a subdivision may merge into the\n        [County and District] retirement   system on\n        conditions  prescribed   by the    board   of\n        trustees [of the County and District Retire-\n        ment System].\n\nSection 842.006 is the amended version of what originally\nwas denominated  sections 10 and 11 in V.T.C.S.   article\n6228g.\n\n     Subsection (c) of section 62 article XVI, which created\nthe County and District Retirement   System, authorized  the\nlegislature to provide for a voluntary merger of subdivision\n(b) \"local systems\" into the state system. Pursuant to this\nauthorization, section 10 of article 6228g, V.T.C.S.,    was\n\n\n\n\n                              p. 6031\n\fHonorable Hugh Parmer - Page 21 (JM-1142)\n\n\n\n\nenacted to govern the merger of a .local county system into\nthe newly-created   state-wide  system.

Thus it is evident\nthat the legislature did not assume that such implied\nauthority existedl9.\n\n\n\n      17.

It is suggested that the Internal Revenue      Code\nitself confers authority on special districts to enter into\nplans approved by the IRS. We disagree.

Instead, it misapplies a rule of statutory\nconstruction.   It is urged that, because the staff of the\nState Property Tax Board, in its published newsletters  and\npamphlets, declared that appraisal districts were empowered\nto create local pension     systems other than those whose\ncreation   is specifically    authorized  by statute,  this\nadministrative construction   should be given great weight.\nWe do not find this argument convincing.\n\n     It is an accepted ,principle of statutory  construction\nthat the construction   placed upon a statute by the agency\ncharged with its administration is entitled to great weight,\nEx narte Roloff,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1672401\"><a href=\"/opinion/1672401/ex-parte-roloff/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (Tex. 1974): State v.:\nAransas Dock and Channel Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2398574\"><a href=\"/opinion/2398574/state-v-aransas-dock-and-channel-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

But in this instance. the\napplication of this 'principle is undermined    because  the\nadministrative construction made by the staff of the State\nProperty Tax Board has not been consistent.\n\n      As early as 1983, the pamphlet published by the agency\n entitled \"Appraisal Board Manual: A Handbook for Countywide\n Appraisal District  Directors\" provided     specifically  that\n,appraisal districts could participate   in either the County\n and District Retirement System or a private retirement plan.\n Id. at 19-20. But even earlier, in an issue of the agency's\n monthly newsletter   ?3tatement,\" published   in August  1980,\n the agency  indicated that the only options available       to\n appraisal districts were participation in the federal Social\n Security program, the County and District Retirement System,\n or both.

In this instance, the State Property\nTax Board has no duties relative to any of the statutes\ngoverning   the creation of pension    systems or deferred\ncompensation plans. Without regard to either the skill or\nknowledge of the staff of the State Property Tax Board,\ntheir administrative   construction  of these statutes    is\nentitled   to no greater weight than the administrative\nconstructions of these same provisions by the staff of, for\nexample, the Texas Water Commission or the Department     of\nPublic Safety.\n\n     We therefore conclude that appraisal districts have no\nimplied authority, absent specific statcltory authority,   to\ncreate local pension systems. Accordingly, we conclude taat\nappraisal districts may participate in the following: .the\nfederal Social Security program pursuant   to article   695g,\nV.T.C.S., the County and District Retirement System pursuant\nto chapter    842 of the Government    Code, and    deferred\ncompensation   plans authorized   by article   6252-3e    and\n6252-3f,,V.T.C.S.   (to be superseded by article    6252-3g,\nV.T.C.S., effective September 1, 1990). Appraisal districts\nhave no implied authority to create local retirement systems\nanalogous to those authorized by articles V.T.C.S. 6243k and\n62283, which incorporated cities and counties, respectively,\nmay create. We turn finally to your second question.\n\n\n\n     You wish to know what        will be the income       tax\nconsequences to individual appraisal district employees    and\nthe proper method of disbursing funds held in any retirement\nplans in the event that any plans already       in place were\nentered into improperly. The Texas Association of Appraisal\nDistricts conducted a survey of its members that     indicated\nthat, among the 254 counties of the state, 124 appraisal\ndistricts offer \"local retirement   plans.\"   If an appraisal\ndistrict created a local plan that was not authorized       by\nstatute, the apparent varieties as to contracts        entered\ninto, benefits    offered, system or plan administration,\nrestrictions   as to    participation,   years required    for\nvesting,   employee contributions,    and appraisal   district\ncontributions are so great that an attempt would necessarily\nrequire us to answer hypothetical questions     and engage  in\nfact-finding, neither of which is permitted in the opinion\nprocess.
