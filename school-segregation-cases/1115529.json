Walker, Jr., Massillon, Ohio, for Appellants.\n\nC. Craig Woods, Squire Sanders (US) LLP, and Greta M. Kearns, Greta Kearns Law LLC,\nColumbus, Ohio, for Appellees.\n\n\n\nHoover, J.\n\n\n           {¶ 1} These consolidated appeals arise from two underlying lawsuits filed in the\n\nWashington County Common Pleas Court: one filed by relator-appellant Edward Verhovec\n\nagainst the City of Marietta and city officials in their official capacity (Washington County C.P.\n\nNo. 11OT197); and the other filed by relator-appellant Dorothy Verhovec, Edward Verhovec’s\n\nwife, against the City of Marietta and city officials in their official capacity (Washington County\n\nC.P. No. 11OT202).1 Both lawsuits asserted claims for mandamus and civil forfeiture relief\n\n\n1\n    The City of Marietta and the named city officials will hereinafter be collectively referred to as “the City.”\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                               2\n\n\nunder Ohio’s Public Records Act. The Verhovecs were, and continue to be represented by\n\nappellant, William E. Walker, Jr., in their respective lawsuits against the City.\n\n\n       {¶ 2} The trial court awarded the City summary judgment relief on the claims asserted\n\nby Dorothy Verhovec. That decision is the subject of a separate appeal before this court. See\n\nState ex rel. Dorothy Verhovec v. The City of Marietta, et al., 4th Dist. Washington No. 12CA32.\n\nThe trial court also granted the City’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the claims\n\nasserted by Edward Verhovec. Following the dismissal of his claims, Edward Verhovec filed a\n\nmotion for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees. The City likewise filed a motion\n\nfor sanctions and fees against the Verhovecs and attorney Walker in both lawsuits, contending\n\nthat the lawsuits were frivolous. After permitting the parties to brief the issues, and after holding\n\na joint hearing on the dueling motions, the trial court denied Edward Verhovec’s motion for\n\ndamages, court costs, and attorney’s fees, but awarded sanctions against the Verhovecs and\n\nappellant Walker on the City’s motion.\n\n\n       {¶ 3} At issue on appeal, is the trial court’s judgment in favor of the City on appellant\n\nEdward Verhovec’s motion for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney fees. Also at issue,\n\nis the trial court’s award of sanctions against the Verhovecs and appellant Walker. For the\n\nreasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n                                                     I.\n\n\n                                                  FACTS\n\n\nA.     The Public Record Requests\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                                          3\n\n\n        {¶ 4} On August 21, 2010, Dorothy Verhovec made a written public record request to\n\nCathy Coppernol, the former Clerk of Council for the Marietta City Council. The request sought\n\naccess to: (1) city council meeting minutes for each proceeding from January 1, 1990 to August\n\n21, 2010; (2) draft meeting minutes that were handwritten by the Clerks of Council at each\n\ncouncil meeting during the same time frame; and (3) any audio and video recordings made of\n\nthose same meetings. This was the first of many public record requests made by Dorothy\n\nVerhovec, and her husband, Edward Verhovec, to the City.2 On April 18, 2011, Edward\n\nVerhovec requested access to cable television survey data from a survey conducted by the City\n\nin 1999. The request sought access to 3,285 cable survey cards with each card containing five\n\nquestions, and the 16,424 separate responses and/or non-responses to each of the five questions\n\ncontained on the cable survey cards. The August 21, 2010 request and the April 18, 2011 request\n\nformed the basis of the Verhovecs’ lawsuits against the City.\n\n\nB.      The Cushion Contracts\n\n\n        {¶ 5} At least some of the public record requests made by the Verhovecs to the City\n\nwere purportedly inspired by an agreement between Edward Verhovec and Cleveland attorney\n\nPaul Cushion. Mr. Verhovec testified at deposition that he received a letter, out of the blue, from\n\nCushion asking if he would be interested in obtaining public records for him from different cities\n\nthroughout Ohio. Mr. Verhovec subsequently entered into two contracts with Cushion to obtain\n\nfrom various cities either access to or copies of certain public records in exchange for payment of\n\n$1,000.00 to $4,000.00 per city. In particular, Mr. Verhovec was to be paid $1,000.00 under the\n\nCushion contract if he were to successfully obtain Marietta City Council documents and\n\n\n2\n For a complete list of the public record requests made by the Verhovecs, see our decision and judgment entry in\nCase No. 12CA32.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                             4\n\n\nrecordings. Attorney Cushion also provided Mr. Verhovec with form letters to aid his request\n\nfor city council documents from Marietta, Uhrichsville, and Dennison; and red light camera\n\nimages from Trotwood and Dayton.\n\n\n          {¶ 6} Dorothy Verhovec initially testified at her deposition that she had “no idea” why\n\nshe signed the letter requesting the city council documents and recordings from the City. Later\n\nin her deposition, however, Mrs. Verhovec testified that she signed the letter to help her husband\n\nbecause he was ill. Mrs. Verhovec supposedly did not know and did not ask her husband why he\n\nwanted the records. Mrs. Verhovec also testified that she signed other public record request\n\nletters to help her husband but she had no idea why he was seeking the records.\n\n\n          {¶ 7} Mr. Verhovec testified at deposition that he wrote the letter, ultimately signed by\n\nhis wife, requesting the city council documents and recordings. Mr. Verhovec authored the\n\nrequest with the purported intention of being compensated under his contract with attorney\n\nCushion. Mr. Verhovec further testified at deposition that, with respect to the cable television\n\nsurvey cards, he had no interest in the records other than he “hoped to interest Mr. Cushion in\n\nthose.”\n\n\nC.        The City’s Response to the August 21, 2010 Request and April 18, 2011 Request\n\n\n          {¶ 8} The City provided Dorothy Verhovec with access to all the requested records that\n\nwere in its possession; but admittedly, certain audiocassettes containing council meetings had\n\nbeen reused and the handwritten notes of the council meetings were not retained by the city.\n\n\n          {¶ 9} On July 1, 2011, the City made the cable television survey cards and responses\n\navailable to Edward Verhovec for inspection. However, Mr. Verhovec had already filed his\n\nmandamus and civil forfeiture lawsuit four days earlier, on June 27, 2011.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                               5\n\n\nD.     The Lawsuits\n\n\n       {¶ 10} Following inspection of the city council records by the Verhovecs, Dorothy\n\nVerhovec filed her lawsuit seeking both a writ of mandamus compelling the City to provide\n\naccess to all the requested records, and a civil forfeiture claim for every record that had been lost\n\nor destroyed. As mentioned above, Edward Verhovec filed his lawsuit seeking mandamus and\n\ncivil forfeiture just four days prior to the City providing access to all of the requested cable\n\ntelevision survey cards and responses.\n\n\nE.     Edward Verhovec’s Other Lawsuits\n\n\n       {¶ 11} In discovery it was revealed that Edward Verhovec has made numerous other\n\npublic record requests and has filed many other lawsuits in the state seeking civil forfeiture\n\nawards. For instance, Edward Verhovec testified at deposition that, in addition to the records\n\nsought from the City of Marietta, he had sought public records from the following six Ohio\n\ncities: Trotwood, Northwood, Springfield, Hamilton, South Euclid, and Dayton. Mr. Verhovec\n\nhas also filed lawsuits against Northwood, Springfield, Trotwood, and Dayton in connection to\n\nthose requests. In each of those cases, Mr. Verhovec has been represented by appellant Walker.\n\n\nF.     Evidence of a State-Wide Scheme\n\n\n       {¶ 12} The City also presented evidence to the trial court suggesting that the Verhovecs’\n\nlawsuits are part of a larger, state-wide scheme involving several individuals seeking “windfall\n\nforfeiture awards” in connection to public record requests. For instance, the City notes that\n\nattorney Cushion is the named plaintiff in his own public records case in which he is represented\n\nby the Verhovecs’ counsel, appellant Walker. See State ex rel. Cushion v. Massillon, 5th Dist.\n\nStark No. 2010CA00199, 2011-Ohio-4749. The City has also identified a similar contract\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                                                6\n\n\nbetween attorney Cushion and Timothy Rhodes, pertaining to red light traffic photo enforcement\n\nrecords from the City of Chillicothe. Mr. Rhodes testified at deposition that he was also solicited\n\nout of the blue by attorney Cushion to obtain those records. The Rhodes-Cushion contract\n\nultimately resulted in Rhodes filing a mandamus and civil forfeiture lawsuit against Chillicothe.\n\nNotably, Walker represented Rhodes in the Chillicothe lawsuit.3 Rhodes was also the relator in\n\nthe Supreme Court of Ohio public records case, Rhodes v. New Philadelphia, 129 Ohio St.3d\n\n304, 2011-Ohio-3279, 951 N.E.2d 782, in which he was represented by Walker.\n\n\n         {¶ 13} Edward Verhovec also testified at deposition that he solicited his nephew, James\n\nVerhovec, to send public record requests and to file lawsuits seeking mandamus and civil\n\nforfeiture relief. Letters that are virtually identical to the request made by Dorothy Verhovec in\n\nher August 21, 2010 letter, that were prepared by Edward Verhovec, but signed by James\n\nVerhovec, were sent to the city of Uhrichsville and the village of Dennison.4 Those requests\n\neventually resulted in lawsuits, filed by attorney Walker, that are almost identical to this case.\n\nSee State of Ohio ex rel. James Verhovec v. The Village of Dennison, et al., Tuscarawas County\n\nCommon Pleas Court, No. 2011CV060708, and State of Ohio ex rel. James Verhovec v. The City\n\nof Uhrichsville, et al., Tuscarawas County Common Pleas Court, No. 2011CV060707.\n\n\n         {¶ 14} The City has also identified numerous other lawsuits in the State of Ohio in\n\nwhich Walker has represented individuals seeking civil forfeiture claims related to public records\n\nrequests. See State ex rel. Davila v. Bellefontaine, 3rd Dist. Logan No. 8-11-01, 2011-Ohio-\n\n4890; State ex rel. Bell v. London, 12th Dist. Madison Nos. CA2010-11-027, CA2010-11-029,\n\n2011-Ohio-3914; State ex rel. Davila v. Bucyrus, 194 Ohio App.3d 325, 2011-Ohio-1731, 956\n3\n  The Chillicothe litigation recently came on appeal to this court. See State ex rel. Rhodes v. Chillicothe, 4th Dist.\nRoss No. 12CA3333, 2013-Ohio-1858.\n4\n  Edward Verhovec was to be paid $1,000.00 per city under his contract with Cushion, if he were able to obtain\naccess to or copies of the council documents and recordings from Marietta, Uhrichsville, and Dennison.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                             7\n\n\nN.E.2d 332 (3rd Dist.); State ex rel. Davila v. East Liverpool, 7th Dist. Columbiana No.\n\n10CO16, 2011-Ohio-1347.\n\n\nG.     The Disposition of the Underlying Claims\n\n\n       {¶ 15} The trial court granted the City summary judgment on Dorothy Verhovec’s\n\nmandamus and forfeiture claims, finding, inter alia, that the City had produced all of the records\n\nin its possession and that Dorothy was not “aggrieved.” That decision is on appeal to this court in\n\nCase No. 12CA32. The trial court also granted the City judgment on the pleadings on Edward\n\nVerhovec’s mandamus and forfeiture claims, finding that the claims were moot because the City\n\nhad produced all of the requested records (the cable television survey cards and responses).\n\n\nH.     Edward Verhovec’s Motion for Statutory Damages, Court Costs, and Attorney’s Fees\n\n\n       {¶ 16} Following the disposition of his underlying claims, Edward Verhovec filed a\n\nmotion seeking statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees.\n\n\nI.     The City’s Request for Sanctions\n\n\n       {¶ 17} Also following the disposition of the underlying lawsuits, the City moved for an\n\naward of fees and sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11 on the grounds that the lawsuits\n\nwere frivolous and brought in bad faith. The Verhovecs’ each subsequently filed an original\n\naction in this court seeking a writ of prohibition to prevent the trial court from applying R.C.\n\n2323.51 (See State ex rel. Edward Verhovec v. Washington County Common Pleas Court, et al.,\n\n4th Dist. Washington No. 12CA43, and State ex rel. Dorothy Verhovec v. Washington County\n\nCommon Pleas Court, et al., 4th Dist. Washington No. 12CA44). We dismissed the Verhovecs’\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                         8\n\n\noriginal actions on December 17, 2012, and they have both appealed those dismissals to the Ohio\n\nSupreme Court.\n\n\nJ.     The Trial Court’s December 12, 2012 Decision\n\n\n       {¶ 18} On September 10, 2012, the trial court held a joint hearing on both Edward\n\nVerhovec’s motion for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees; and on the City’s\n\nmotion for sanctions. On December 12, 2012, the trial court issued a decision, which among\n\nother things, denied Edward’s motion, and granted the City’s motion for sanctions. The trial\n\ncourt found the Verhovecs’ lawsuits were frivolous and warranted sanctions under both R.C.\n\n2323.51 and Civil Rule 11:\n\n\n       Their objective is to prove the destruction or loss of the documents so that they\n       can collect forfeiture payments and attorney fees under the Public Record Law.\n       The Court finds that such action constitutes frivolous conduct which warrants the\n       award of attorney fees and costs. The Court finds that such conduct violates Civil\n       Rule 11.\n[December 12, 2012 Decision at 18.]\n\n\n       {¶ 19} To that end, the trial court issued sanctions of $32,974.51 in Edward’s case, and\n\n$274,033.49 as sanctions in Dorothy’s case, to reimburse the City’s costs and attorney’s fees\n\nincurred in defending the lawsuits. The trial court issued the sanctions jointly against the\n\nVerhovecs and appellant Walker under R.C. 2323.51, and individually against appellant Walker\n\nunder Civil Rule 11.\n\n\nK.     The Consolidated Appeals\n\n\n       {¶ 20} The two underlying lawsuits have resulted in five appeals which we have\n\nconsolidated; as well as the separate appeal in Case No. 12CA32.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                            9\n\n\n       {¶ 21} In September 2011, the trial court issued a decision awarding judgment on the\n\npleadings in favor of the City on Edward’s mandamus and forfeiture claims because his claims\n\nhad been rendered moot by the City’s production of all the requested records. Before the trial\n\ncourt journalized its decision, Edward moved the court for an award of statutory damages, court\n\ncosts, and attorney’s fees pursuant to R.C. 149.43(C)(1). Without ruling on Edward’s motion,\n\nthe trial court journalized its Entry of Dismissal. Edward subsequently appealed from the Entry\n\nof Dismissal (Case No. 11CA29). On appeal, we remanded the case so that the trial court could\n\ndispose of Edward’s remaining claims of statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees.\n\nEdward moved for summary judgment on those remaining claims in July 2012.\n\n\n       {¶ 22} In June and July 2012, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the\n\nCity on Dorothy’s mandamus and forfeiture claims. Dorothy has appealed that decision (Case\n\nNo. 12CA32).\n\n\n       {¶ 23} In August 2012, the City moved for fees and sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 and\n\nCivil Rule 11 in both of the underlying lawsuits. The trial court subsequently consolidated the\n\nlawsuits and held an evidentiary hearing on September 10, 2012.\n\n\n       {¶ 24} On November 13, 2012, the trial court issued a decision granting the City’s\n\nmotion for sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11 and denying Edward’s motion for\n\nstatutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees. The decision also disposed of all other\n\npending motions.

The mandamus action may be commenced in the court of\n      common pleas of the county in which division (B) of this section allegedly was\n      not complied with, in the supreme court pursuant to its original jurisdiction under\n      Section 2 of Article IV, Ohio Constitution, or in the court of appeals for the\n      appellate district in which division (B) of this section allegedly was not complied\n      with pursuant to its original jurisdiction under Section 3 of Article IV, Ohio\n      Constitution.\n      If a requestor transmits a written request by hand delivery or certified mail to\n      inspect or receive copies of any public record in a manner that fairly describes the\n      public record or class of public records to the public office or person responsible\n      for the requested public records, except as otherwise provided in this section, the\n      requestor shall be entitled to recover the amount of statutory damages set forth in\n      this division if a court determines that the public office or the person responsible\n      for public records failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division\n      (B) of this section.\n      The amount of statutory damages shall be fixed at one hundred dollars for each\n      business day during which the public office or person responsible for the\n      requested public records failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with\n      division (B) of this section, beginning with the day on which the requester files a\n      mandamus action to recover statutory damages, up to a maximum of one thousand\n      dollars. The award of statutory damages shall not be construed as a penalty, but\n      as compensation for injury arising from lost use of the requested information.\n      The existence of this injury shall be conclusively presumed. The award of\n      statutory damages shall be in addition to all other remedies authorized by this\n      section.\n      The court may reduce an award of statutory damages or not award statutory\n      damages if the court determines both of the following:\n      (a) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory law and case law as it\n      existed at the time of the conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or\n      person responsible for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a\n      failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division (B) of this\n      section and that was the basis of the mandamus action, a well-informed public\n      office or person responsible for the requested public records reasonably would\n      believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person\n      responsible for the requested public records did not constitute a failure to comply\n      with an obligation in accordance with division (B) of this section;\n      (b) That a well-informed public office or person responsible for the requested\n      public records reasonably would believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of\n      the public office or person responsible for the requested public records would\n      serve the public policy that underlies the authority that is asserted as permitting\n      that conduct or threatened conduct.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                       15\n\n\n       (2)(a) If the court issues a writ of mandamus that orders the public office or the\n       person responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) or this\n       section and determines that the circumstances described in division (C)(1) of this\n       section exists, the court shall determine and award to the relator all court costs.\n       (b) If the court renders a judgment that orders the public office or the person\n       responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of this section, the\n       court may award reasonable attorney’s fees subject to reduction as described in\n       division (C)(2)(c) of this section. The court shall award reasonable attorney’s\n       fees, subject to reduction as described in division (C)(2)(c) of this section when\n       either of the following applies:\n       (i) The public office or the person responsible for the public records failed to\n       respond affirmatively or negatively to the public records request in accordance\n       with the time allowed under division (B) of this section.\n       (ii) The public office or the person responsible for the public records promised to\n       permit the relator to inspect or receive copies of the public records requested\n       within a specified period of time but failed to fulfill that promise within the\n       specified period of time.\n       (c) Court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees awarded under this section shall be\n       construed as remedial and not punitive. Reasonable attorney’s fees shall include\n       reasonable fees incurred to produce proof of the reasonableness and amount of the\n       fees and to otherwise litigate entitlement to the fees. The court may reduce an\n       award of attorney’s fees to the relator or not award attorney’s fees to the relator if\n       the court determines both of the following:\n       (i) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory law and case law as it\n       existed at the time of the conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or\n       person responsible for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a\n       failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division (B) of this\n       section and that was the basis of the mandamus action, a well-informed public\n       office or person responsible for the requested public records reasonably would\n       believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person\n       responsible for the requested public records did not constitute a failure to comply\n       with an obligation in accordance with division (B) of this section;\n       (ii) That a well-informed public office or person responsible for the requested\n       public records reasonably would believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of\n       the public office or person responsible for the requested public records as\n       described in division (C)(2)(c)(i) of this section would serve the public policy that\n       underlies the authority that is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened\n       conduct.\n       {¶ 34} Furthermore, “[t]he Supreme Court of Ohio has established that the award of\n\nattorney fees is dependent upon an aggrieved party demonstrating that the release of the\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                              16\n\n\nrequested public records provides a public benefit that is greater than the benefit to the\n\nrequester.” Hartkemeyer at ¶ 30, citing State ex rel.

State ex\n\nrel. Patton v. Rhodes, 129 Ohio St.3d 182, 2011-Ohio-3093, 950 N.E.2d 965, ¶ 12.\n\n\n       {¶ 35} In the case sub judice, Edward Verhovec made his written public record request\n\nto the City for the cable television survey cards and responses on April 18, 2011. The City did\n\nnot immediately respond to Mr. Verhovec’s request, so on June 27, 2011, he commenced the\n\ninstant action for mandamus and civil forfeiture relief.\n\n\n       {¶ 36} Four days after the lawsuit was filed, on July 1, 2011, the City responded to the\n\nrequest and notified Mr. Verhovec that the records were available for inspection. Shortly\n\nthereafter, Edward Verhovec moved for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees.\n\n\n       {¶ 37} Meanwhile, at all times relevant to this matter, the City had a public records\n\npolicy that required it to acknowledge, in writing, all public record requests within three business\n\ndays following the public office’s receipt of the request. It is undisputed that the City did not\n\ncomply with its policy, and did not acknowledge receipt of the request in writing.\n\n\n       {¶ 38} Edward Verhovec first contends that the City’s failure to comply with its public\n\nrecords policy -requiring the public office to acknowledge a records request within three\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                             17\n\n\nbusiness days – was tantamount to the City’s failure to promptly provide access to the requested\n\nrecords as required by R.C. 149.43(B)(1). Appellant concludes that the trial court erred in not\n\nawarding him summary judgment, because as a matter of law, he was entitled to statutory\n\ndamages, court costs, and attorney’s fees under R.C. 149.43(C)(1)-(2).\n\n\n          {¶ 39} Edward’s first argument fails, however, because in order to recover damages,\n\ncosts, or fees under the Public Records Act, one must first prove a violation of the Act.\n\nStrothers, 131 Ohio St.3d 359, 2012-Ohio-1007, 965 N.E.2d 282, at ¶ 21 (“An award of statutory\n\ndamages under R.C. 149.43(C)(1) is premised on a violation of R.C. 149.43(B).”). Simply put,\n\nbefore one may recover damages, costs, or fees, he must demonstrate that the respondent did not\n\nact promptly in responding to the request.\n\n\n          {¶ 40} Here, Edward leaps to the conclusion that because the City failed to adhere to its\n\nacknowledgement policy, than it also failed to act promptly; and thus, he was entitled to\n\ndamages, costs, and fees as a matter of law. Edward’s analysis, however, plainly contradicts\n\nestablished case law, which consistently has held that the determination of whether a public\n\noffice or person responsible for public records has acted promptly is dependent upon the facts\n\nand circumstances of the case. Strothers at ¶ 21 (finding 45 day delay reasonable); State ex rel.\n\nMcCray v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 11AP-1055, 2012-Ohio-2997, ¶ 3\n\n(finding 60 day delay reasonable); State ex rel. Patton, 129 Ohio St.3d 182, 2011-Ohio-3093,\n\n950 N.E.2d 965, at ¶ 20 (finding 56 day delay reasonable). Thus, the proper inquiry is whether\n\nthe trial court, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, abused its discretion in concluding that\n\nthe City “promptly” responded to the request – an inquiry which appellant does not make on\n\nappeal.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                                              18\n\n\n        {¶ 41} Thus, when viewed in the proper context, the factual issue of whether the City\n\npromptly responded to the request precluded summary judgment relief. Moreover, Edward’s\n\nargument that the City’s noncompliance with its acknowledgment policy resulted in a statutory\n\nbreach under the Act is also without merit and does not provide a basis to recover under\n\nsummary judgment.5\n\n\n        {¶ 42} Edward next argues that the trial court improperly determined that he was not\n\nentitled to damages, costs, or attorney’s fees because he was not “aggrieved.” While the trial\n\ncourt decision did discuss the aggrievement issue; the trial court’s analysis of that issue formed\n\nthe basis for its decision to issue sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11. The trial court\n\nnever ruled, as appellant suggests, that it declined to award damages, costs, or fees on the basis\n\nthat Edward was not “aggrieved.” Rather, the trial court’s decision not to award damages, costs,\n\nand fees was based on the fact that the City promptly made the records available under the\n\nunique facts and circumstances of the case; and on its decision to exercise its discretion under the\n\nAct not to award the relief requested.6 Edward’s aggreivement argument is simply misplaced.\n\n        {¶ 43} Based on the foregoing, it cannot be said that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nin denying Edward’s motion for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees.\n\nAccordingly, Edward’s first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\n\nB.      The Judgment Imposing Sanctions Under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Edward argued that R.C. 149.43(B)(7) imposed a statutory duty on the City to comply with its acknowledgment\npolicy. That provision, however, simply requires public offices to comply with internal policies regarding the\ntransmission of records “by United States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission pursuant to this\ndivision.” The provision does not create a statutory duty for public offices to comply with any other policies\npertaining to public records.\n6\n  See R.C. 149.43(C)(1) and (2), supra, granting the court discretion to decrease or decline an award of damages and\nfees even where a public office has violated the Act.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                        19\n\n\n       {¶ 44} The remaining assignments of error raised by appellants Edward Verhovec,\n\nDorothy Verhovec, and William E.

The test, we find, is whether no reasonable lawyer would have brought the\n       action in light of the existing law.

Rather, the sanctions\n\nwere clearly awarded under the frivolous conduct statute, R.C. 2323.51, and Civ.R. 11.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                                               23\n\n\nAccordingly, there is no basis to support the appellants’ contention that the trial court\n\nretrospectively applied R.C. 149.351(C)(2).

If such a rule were uniformly enforced, ‘ * * * hardly a single trial could\n         be adequately prosecuted.’ 1A Wigmore, Evidence (Tillers Rev.1983) 1106,\n         1111, Section 41. See, also, United States v. Eustace (C.A. 2, 1970), 423 F.2d\n         569, 571. ‘Today most students of the problem of inference recognize that any\n         single vision about the world or conclusion of fact rests on a multitude of\n         inferences, premises, and beliefs, on a large complex of assumptions, and on a\n\n7 Appellants’ specifically contend that the trial court abused its discretion in making the frivolous finding because\nthe finding was not supported by competent, credible evidence; but instead, was based upon the stacking of one\ninference upon another. To the extent that appellants are challenging the frivolous finding under R.C. 2323.51, the\nquestion of whether conduct is frivolous is a question of law that an appellate court independently reviews. See ¶\n48, supra.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                                24\n\n\n          body of implicit or explicit principles by which the human organism perceives,\n          organizes, structures, and understands experience; thus it is generally conceded\n          that it is meaningless to denounce multistaged or cascaded inferences.’\n          (Emphasis sic.)

Despite appellants’ arguments, the City was able to put forth sufficient\n\nevidence that the Verhovecs, and appellant Walker, feigned their intent to access the public\n\nrecords through the guise of the Cushion contract when their actual intent was to seek forfeiture\n\nawards. Such conduct is frivolous because the lawsuits were brought for an “improper purpose,”\n\nand because the Verhovecs were not “aggrieved” persons for purposes of civil forfeiture\n\ndamages as that term was defined by the Ohio Supreme Court in State ex rel. Rhodes v. New\n\nPhiladelphia.\n\n\n          {¶ 62} All of the evidence in the instant case indicates that the appellants are involved in\n\nan intricate scheme to take advantage of the Public Records Act, specifically the civil forfeiture\n\nprovision, by seeking to prove the improper destruction of voluminous and archaic public\n\nrecords. The only explanation offered by the appellants to rebut this conclusion, is that the\n\nrecords were sought by Edward Verhovec to fulfill his contracts with attorney Cushion. Yet, Mr.\n\nVerhovec testified that he was unsure of what exactly needed to be produced in order to collect\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                           25\n\n\npayment under the contracts. Moreover, it is undisputed that the cable television survey cards\n\nand responses were not required to be produced for any Cushion contract. Mr. Verhovec tried to\n\nexplain that he sought the cable television records because he thought they may interest Mr.\n\nCushion. Yet, even after learning that Cushion was not interested in the records he still pursued\n\nhis lawsuit for civil forfeiture damages; and after he verified that all the survey cards were\n\npresent, he no longer had any interest in the cards. Mr. Verhovec has also filed numerous other\n\nlawsuits throughout the state seeking forfeiture damages. Absent the Cushion contracts, there\n\nare no logical explanations for these lawsuits. The Verhovecs are not historians. They have\n\nnever resided in the City of Marietta. Mr. Verhovec had not even heard of the Public Records\n\nAct prior to being contacted by attorney Cushion “out of the blue.” Mr. Verhovec is also the\n\ndriving force behind the lawsuits filed by his nephew, James Verhovec, against the Village of\n\nDennison and the City of Uhrichville. Those lawsuits also seek significant forfeiture damages.\n\nWe also cannot ignore the connections between Walker and Cushion. Walker represented\n\nCushion in Cushion’s very own civil forfeiture lawsuit. Walker also represented Timothy\n\nRhodes in the Chillicothe lawsuit, in which Rhodes allegedly sought the records to fulfill his\n\ncontract with Cushion. Finally, Walker represents James Verhovec in his lawsuits against\n\nUhrichsville and Dennison.\n\n\n       {¶ 63} The lawsuits at issue in this case, the James Verhovec lawsuits, and the Timothy\n\nRhodes Chillicothe lawsuit were all allegedly commenced so that the parties could retrieve the\n\nnecessary documents required under the Cushion contracts. Both Rhodes and Edward Verhovec\n\nwere allegedly contacted out of the blue by attorney Cushion; and while the Verhovecs’ deny\n\nhaving a relationship with Rhodes both the Verhovecs and Rhodes are represented by Walker.\n\nMoreover, Walker has represented Cushion in Cushion’s very own public records lawsuit.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                                              26\n\n\nAppellants would have us believe that this is a matter of coincidence; but we cannot ignore the\n\nconnections. Based on the foregoing evidence, the trial court’s conclusion that the appellants’\n\ntrue intent was to prove the nonexistence of the records so that they could collect the forfeiture\n\nawards is reasonable; and, it is a conclusion that we share with the trial court.8 As such, there is\n\nno doubt that the lawsuits were frivolous, as the law defines that term.\n\n\n         {¶ 64} In sum, we conclude that the appellants have no interest in the requested records\n\nother than to build a case for forfeiture and reimbursement of attorney’s fees. To the extent that\n\nour conclusion rests on any inferences, they are reasonable inferences that are supported by the\n\nrecord. In light of the foregoing, the trial court correctly concluded that the appellants acted\n\nfrivolously by pursuing litigation for such an improper purpose.\n\n\n         {¶ 65} Appellants also contend that it is improper to consider their motives for\n\nrequesting the records when determining whether their conduct is frivolous. In the context of a\n\nmandamus claim, the requester’s motive is indeed irrelevant. See New Philadelphia, 129 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 304, 2011-Ohio-3279, 951 N.E.2d 782, at ¶ 20 (“[A] public office is obligated to honor a\n\nrecords request by ‘any person’ and that a person does not have to explain his or her reasons for\n\nwanting to inspect and copy a public record in order to validity request the record.”); see also\n\nR.C. 149.43(B)(4) (prohibiting public office from conditioning availability of records by\n\nrequiring disclosure of the requestor’s identity or purpose). However, both of the lawsuits also\n\nsought civil forfeiture damages. While “any person” may make a public records request under\n\nR.C. 149.43(B), the Supreme Court of Ohio has rejected the notion that “any person” can recover\n\n8\n At least one other Ohio court has alluded to a similar scheme involving Rhodes, and others. Represented by\nattorney Walker, and nicknamed the “Public Records Police,” the Twelfth District Court of Appeals noted that the\ngroup “sought to become some of the highest paid ‘police’ in Ohio” through their forfeiture actions. State ex rel.\nBell v. London, 2011-Ohio-3914 at ¶ 42 (“Bell, Davila, and Rhodes refer to themselves as the ‘public records\npolice,’ and relying on the civil forfeiture provision in R.C. 149.351(B)(2) * * * have sought to become some of the\nhighest paid ‘police’ in Ohio.”).\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                              27\n\n\nforfeiture under R.C. 149.351. State ex rel. Rhodes v. Chillicothe, 2013-Ohio-1858 at ¶ 43,\n\nciting New Philadelphia at ¶¶ 20, 23. “We cannot ignore the General Assembly’s use of the term\n\n‘aggrieved,’ and we conclude that the General Assembly did not intend to impose forfeiture\n\nwhen it can be proved that the requester’s legal rights were not infringed, because the requester’s\n\nonly intent was to prove the nonexistence of the records.” New Philadelphia at ¶ 23.\n\n\n       {¶ 66} Thus, it is proper to consider the appellants’ motives, because their motivations\n\nare relevant in determining whether they are actually aggrieved for purposes of civil forfeiture\n\nrelief, or rather, as in here, the lawsuits were brought for the improper purpose of proving the\n\nnonexistence of the records.\n\n\n       {¶ 67} Based on the foregoing, appellant’s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n       {¶ 68} For their third assignment of error, appellants’ contend that the trial court violated\n\nEvid.R. 404(B) by considering improper “character evidence” and “other acts” evidence in\n\nmaking its frivolous conduct finding.\n\n\n       {¶ 69} Evid.R. 404(B) provides in pertinent part:\n\n       Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character\n       of a person to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be\n       admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent,\n       preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\n       {¶ 70} “[T]he decision to admit Evid.R. 404(B) prior acts evidence rests in the trial\n\ncourt’s sound discretion and that decision should not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.”\n\nState v.

Bey,\n\n85 Ohio St.3d 487, 490, 709 N.E.2d 484 (1999).\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                             28\n\n\n       {¶ 71} Appellants’ argue that “Evid. R. 404(B) justifies the preclusion of character\n\nevidence and ‘other acts’ evidence in this case.” However, they make no effort to identify which\n\nevidence was allegedly improper under the rule. Thus, it is impossible for us to determine\n\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion. Moreover, it is not our duty to make an argument\n\nfor the appellant. In re A.Z., 4th Dist.

Accordingly,\n\nwe reject appellants’ argument and overrule their third assignment of error.\n\n\n       {¶ 72} For their fourth assignment of error, appellants’ contend that they are immune\n\nfrom sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 because they are not purportedly the real party interest.\n\nInstead, they contend that the State of Ohio is the real party in interest because the Verhovecs\n\nbrought their actions in mandamus.\n\n\n       {¶ 73} R.C. 2323.51(B)(4) provides that: “An award made pursuant to division (B)(1) of\n\nthis section may be made against a party, the party’s counsel of record, or both.” Appellants\n\ncontend that since the lawsuits were required to be brought in the name of the state on relation of\n\nthe petitioner, the state, and not the petitioner, is the party for purposes of R.C. 2323.51.\n\n\n       {¶ 74} Appellants, however, completely ignore existing case law from the Ohio Supreme\n\nCourt, which upheld sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 against a party that brought a mandamus\n\naction to compel public records under R.C. 149.43. See State ex rel. Striker v. Cline, 130 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 214, 2011-Ohio-5350, 957 N.E.2d 19. Furthermore, appellants have not cited a single case\n\nin support of the proposition that a requestor bringing a mandamus action under the Public\n\nRecords Act is immune from sanctions under R.C. 2323.51.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                              29\n\n\n        {¶ 75} Rather, the case law cited by appellants’ supports the proposition that where the\n\nobject of a mandamus action is to enforce a public right, the state is regarded as the real party in\n\ninterest. But here, in addition to their mandamus actions, appellants sought civil forfeiture\n\nawards, statutory damages, attorney’s fees, and costs. The intended purpose of the lawsuits was\n\nto line the appellants’ pockets to the detriment of the City; not to serve a broader public interest\n\nof the state.\n\n\n        {¶ 76} Accordingly, appellants’ argument that they are immune from sanctions for their\n\nfrivolous conduct simply because their claims sound in mandamus is without merit. Their fourth\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n        {¶ 77} For their fifth assignment of error, appellants’ contend that the trial court lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction to award sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 because that statute applies\n\nonly to “civil actions” and a mandamus action is not a “civil action.”\n\n\n        {¶ 78} The Verhovecs made nearly identical arguments to this court in their prohibition\n\nactions (Case Nos. 12CA43, 12CA44). In those cases, we expressly rejected the argument, and\n\ninstead we held that a mandamus action under the Public Records Act is a “civil action” for\n\npurposes of R.C. 2323.51:\n\n\n        * * * Verhovec alleges that the trial court and Judge Boyer do not have\n        jurisdiction to address the merits of Marietta’s sanction motion under R.C.\n        2323.51, because that statutory provision applies only to “civil actions” and a\n        mandamus action is not a “civil action.” Verhovec is wrong for two reasons.\n        First, a mandamus action is a civil action. State ex rel. Spirko v. Court of\n        Appeals, 27 Ohio St.3d 13, 501 N.E.2d 625 (1986)(“A proceeding for a writ of\n        mandamus is a civil action”); State ex rel. Wilson v. Preston, 173 Ohio St. 203,\n        208, 181 N.E.2d 31 (1962)(“an action for a writ of mandamus is a civil action”);\n        State ex rel. Karmasu v. Tate, 83 Ohio App.3d 199, 206 (4th Dist.\n        1992)(“Mandamus is a civil action”). The frivolous conduct statute, R.C.\n        2323.51, states that it is applicable to certain conduct, including the conduct of\n        “filing of a civil action … or the taking of any other action in connection with a\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                              30\n\n\n       civil action. …” Thus, that statutory provision can be employed to request\n       sanctions for frivolous conduct occurring within the context of a civil action\n       seeking a writ of mandamus. State ex rel. Striker v. Cline, 130 Ohio St.3d 214,\n       2011-Ohio-5350, 957 N.E.2d 214 (upholding the lower court’s award of sanctions\n       for frivolous conduct under R.C. 2323.51 in a mandamus action brought to\n       compel public records under R.C. 149.43).\nState ex rel. Edward Verhovec v. Washington County Common Pleas Court, et al., 4th Dist.\n\nWashington No. 12CA43, Dec. 17, 2012 Decision and Judgment Entry at 3-4; State ex rel.\n\nDorothy Verhovec v. Washington County Common Pleas Court, et al., 4th Dist. Washington No.\n\n12CA44, Dec. 17, 2012 Decision and Judgment Entry at 3-4.\n\n\n       {¶ 79} Appellants have not identified any authority that would call into question our\n\nearlier decisions. Thus, for the reasons stated in Case Nos. 12CA43 and 12CA44, we overrule\n\nappellants’ fifth assignment of error.\n\n\n       {¶ 80} For their sixth assignment of error, appellants’ contend that the trial court erred to\n\nEdward and Walker’s prejudice when it failed to dismiss the City’s motion for sanctions in case\n\nNo. 11OT197, because the motion was purportedly untimely.\n\n\n       {¶ 81} R.C. 2323.51(B)(1) permits a party to file a motion for sanctions “at any time not\n\nmore than thirty days after the entry of final judgment.” Appellants argue that the City was\n\nrequired to file its motion within 30 days of the trial court’s September 26, 2011 order, which\n\ngranted the City’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. That order, however, was not a “final\n\njudgment.”\n\n\n       {¶ 82} The time period for filing a frivolous conduct claim under R.C. 2323.51 runs\n\nfrom the entry of the “final appealable order.” Soler v. Evans, St. Clair & Kelsey, 94 Ohio St.3d\n\n432, 436, 763 N.E.2d 1169 (2002). An order must meet the requirements of R.C. 2505.02 to\n\nconstitute a final, appealable order. Chef Italiano Corp. v. Kent State Univ., 44 Ohio St.3d 86,\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                            31\n\n\n88, 541 N.E.2d 64 (1989). Under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1), an order is a final order if it “affects a\n\nsubstantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment[.]” To\n\ndetermine the action and prevent a judgment, the order “must dispose of the whole merits of the\n\ncause or some separate and distinct branch thereof and leave nothing for the determination of the\n\ncourt.” Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation & Dev. Disabilities v. Professionals Guild of\n\nOhio, 46 Ohio St.3d 147, 153, 545 N.E.2d 1260 (1989).\n\n\n       {¶ 83} Additionally, if the case involves multiple parties or multiple claims, the court’s\n\norder must meet the requirements of Civ.R. 54(B) to qualify as a final, appealable order. See\n\nChef Italiano Corp. at 88. Under Civ.R. 54(B), “[w]hen more than one claim for relief is\n\npresented in an action whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, and\n\nwhether arising out of the same or separate transactions, or when multiple parties are involved,\n\nthe court may enter final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties\n\nonly upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.” Absent the mandatory\n\nlanguage that “there is no just reason for delay,” an order that does not dispose of all claims is\n\nsubject to modification and is not final and appealable. Noble v. Colwell, 44 Ohio St.3d 92, 96,\n\n540 N.E.2d 1381 (1989); see Civ.R. 54(B). The purpose of Civ.R. 54(B) is “ ‘to make a\n\nreasonable accommodation of the policy against piecemeal appeals with the possible injustice\n\nsometimes created by the delay of appeals[,]’ * * * as well as to insure that parties to such\n\nactions may know when an order or decree has become final for purposes of appeal * * *.”\n\nPokorny v. Tilby Dev. Co., 52 Ohio St.2d 183, 186, 370 N.E.2d 738 (1977), quoting Alexander v.\n\nBuckeye Pipe Line Co., 49 Ohio St.2d 158, 160, 359 N.E.2d 702 (1977).\n\n\n       {¶ 84} Here, the September 26, 2011 Order was not a “final order” under R.C. 2505.02\n\nbecause it did not dispose of Edward’s motion for statutory damages, costs, and attorney’s fees.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                             32\n\n\nSee Case No. 11CA29 (Dec. 16, 2011 Magistrate’s Order). Furthermore, the September 26,\n\n2011 Order did not satisfy the requirements of Civ.R. 54, because it disposed of fewer than all of\n\nthe claims and it did not certify that there were no just reason for delay. Thus, the September 26,\n\n2011 Order was not a “final appealable order,” and it did not trigger the 30-day deadline under\n\nR.C. 2323.51.\n\n\n       {¶ 85} Appellants’ argument that the September 26, 2011 order was labeled a “final\n\nappealable order,” is also without merit. A trial court’s labeling of an entry as a “final\n\nappealable order,” is not dispositive of the issue. In re Murray, 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 157, 556\n\nN.E.2d 1169 (1990) (“Generally, the question of whether an order is final and appealable turns\n\non the effect which the order has on the pending action rather than the name attached to it, or its\n\ngeneral nature.”).\n\n\n       {¶ 86} The City filed its motion for sanctions against Edward Verhovec and attorney\n\nWalker in Case No. 11OT197 on August 16, 2012. The trial court did not enter final judgment\n\nin that case until December 17, 2012. The City’s motion was clearly filed within the statutory\n\ndeadline. Accordingly, we overrule appellants’ sixth assignment of error.\n\n\n       {¶ 87} For their seventh assignment of error, appellants’ contend that the trial court erred\n\nin finding the lawsuits frivolous under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11, because such a finding was\n\nnot supported by “competent, credible evidence.”\n\n\n       {¶ 88} We have already concluded, in response to appellants’ second assignment of\n\nerror, that the appellants’ conduct was frivolous. We noted that our conclusion was supported by\n\nsufficient evidence in the record, and was not the result of speculation or inference stacking. We\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                              33\n\n\ndefer to our analysis above, and hold that there is adequate evidence to support a finding of\n\nfrivolousness under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11.\n\n\n       {¶ 89} Appellants’ further contend that their mandamus claims were legitimate, and thus\n\nnot frivolous, because (1) the City did not respond to Edward’s request until four days after the\n\nfiling of suit; and (2) the City did not provide Dorothy with all of the requested records.\n\nHowever, appellants’ lawsuits also contained a claim for civil forfeiture, and it is clear that they\n\nhad no interest in the records other than to prove their destruction so that they could collect\n\nforfeiture awards and attorney’s fees. The mandamus claims were simply a prerequisite to\n\nobtaining forfeiture awards for the allegedly destroyed records.\n\n\n        {¶ 90} In sum, there is sufficient evidence in the record demonstrating a contrived and\n\nconcerted effort amongst the Verhovecs, attorney Walker, attorney Cushion, and others, to take\n\nadvantage of the civil forfeiture statute for purely pecuniary gain. Appellant’s seventh\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n       {¶ 91} For their eighth and final assignment of error, appellants’ contend that the trial\n\ncourt erred by failing to segregate out the specific fees that were attributable to the appellants’\n\nfrivolous conduct. In their own words: “ * * * Appellees failed to show what conduct caused\n\nwhich expenses. * * * Therefore, it cannot be determined which expenses were reasonably\n\nincurred by what frivolous conduct.”\n\n\n       {¶ 92} Appellants’ argument focuses on the fact that the City did not identify which\n\nattorney’s fees were attributable to the mandamus claims, and which fees were attributable to the\n\ndefense of the forfeiture claims. Essentially, appellants’ argument is premised on the notion that\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                             34\n\n\nthe mandamus claims were not frivolous, and thus, the City is not entitled to reimbursement of\n\nthe cost to defend those claims (see assignment of error seven).\n\n\n       {¶ 93} As noted above, a trial court’s award of attorney’s fees as sanctions under R.C.\n\n2323.51, is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Similarly, an award of attorney’s fees under\n\nCiv.R. 11 is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard of review.\n\n\n       {¶ 94} Here, the trial court found that the lawsuits were frivolous in their entirety.\n\nBecause the trial court determined that the lawsuits were entirely frivolous, it was not necessary\n\nto determine which fees were attributable to the defense of the mandamus claims, and which fees\n\nwere attributable to the forfeiture claims. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion. Appellants’ eighth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                                     IV.\n\n\n                                              CONCLUSION\n\n\n       {¶ 95} For the foregoing reasons, appellant Edward Verhovec’s two assignments of error\n\npertaining to the denial of his motion for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees are\n\noverruled. Likewise, appellants’ joint assignments of error relating to the imposition of sanctions\n\nagainst them for frivolous conduct are also overruled. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                                         JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                           35\n\n\n                                       JUDGMENT ENTRY\n\n\n         It is ordered that the JUDGMENT BE AFFIRMED.

Kearns, Greta Kearns Law LLC,\nColumbus, Ohio, for Appellees.\n\n\n\nHoover, J.\n\n\n           {¶ 1} These consolidated appeals arise from two underlying lawsuits filed in the\n\nWashington County Common Pleas Court: one filed by relator-appellant Edward Verhovec\n\nagainst the City of Marietta and city officials in their official capacity (Washington County C.P.\n\nNo. 11OT197); and the other filed by relator-appellant Dorothy Verhovec, Edward Verhovec’s\n\nwife, against the City of Marietta and city officials in their official capacity (Washington County\n\nC.P. No. 11OT202).1 Both lawsuits asserted claims for mandamus and civil forfeiture relief\n\n\n1\n    The City of Marietta and the named city officials will hereinafter be collectively referred to as “the City.”\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                               2\n\n\nunder Ohio’s Public Records Act. The Verhovecs were, and continue to be represented by\n\nappellant, William E. Walker, Jr., in their respective lawsuits against the City.\n\n\n       {¶ 2} The trial court awarded the City summary judgment relief on the claims asserted\n\nby Dorothy Verhovec. That decision is the subject of a separate appeal before this court. See\n\nState ex rel. Dorothy Verhovec v. The City of Marietta, et al., 4th Dist. Washington No. 12CA32.\n\nThe trial court also granted the City’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the claims\n\nasserted by Edward Verhovec. Following the dismissal of his claims, Edward Verhovec filed a\n\nmotion for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees. The City likewise filed a motion\n\nfor sanctions and fees against the Verhovecs and attorney Walker in both lawsuits, contending\n\nthat the lawsuits were frivolous. After permitting the parties to brief the issues, and after holding\n\na joint hearing on the dueling motions, the trial court denied Edward Verhovec’s motion for\n\ndamages, court costs, and attorney’s fees, but awarded sanctions against the Verhovecs and\n\nappellant Walker on the City’s motion.\n\n\n       {¶ 3} At issue on appeal, is the trial court’s judgment in favor of the City on appellant\n\nEdward Verhovec’s motion for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney fees. Also at issue,\n\nis the trial court’s award of sanctions against the Verhovecs and appellant Walker. For the\n\nreasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n                                                     I.\n\n\n                                                  FACTS\n\n\nA.

The request sought\n\naccess to: (1) city council meeting minutes for each proceeding from January 1, 1990 to August\n\n21, 2010; (2) draft meeting minutes that were handwritten by the Clerks of Council at each\n\ncouncil meeting during the same time frame; and (3) any audio and video recordings made of\n\nthose same meetings. This was the first of many public record requests made by Dorothy\n\nVerhovec, and her husband, Edward Verhovec, to the City.2 On April 18, 2011, Edward\n\nVerhovec requested access to cable television survey data from a survey conducted by the City\n\nin 1999. The request sought access to 3,285 cable survey cards with each card containing five\n\nquestions, and the 16,424 separate responses and/or non-responses to each of the five questions\n\ncontained on the cable survey cards. The August 21, 2010 request and the April 18, 2011 request\n\nformed the basis of the Verhovecs’ lawsuits against the City.\n\n\nB.      The Cushion Contracts\n\n\n        {¶ 5} At least some of the public record requests made by the Verhovecs to the City\n\nwere purportedly inspired by an agreement between Edward Verhovec and Cleveland attorney\n\nPaul Cushion. Mr. Verhovec testified at deposition that he received a letter, out of the blue, from\n\nCushion asking if he would be interested in obtaining public records for him from different cities\n\nthroughout Ohio. Mr. Verhovec subsequently entered into two contracts with Cushion to obtain\n\nfrom various cities either access to or copies of certain public records in exchange for payment of\n\n$1,000.00 to $4,000.00 per city. In particular, Mr. Verhovec was to be paid $1,000.00 under the\n\nCushion contract if he were to successfully obtain Marietta City Council documents and\n\n\n2\n For a complete list of the public record requests made by the Verhovecs, see our decision and judgment entry in\nCase No. 12CA32.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                             4\n\n\nrecordings. Attorney Cushion also provided Mr. Verhovec with form letters to aid his request\n\nfor city council documents from Marietta, Uhrichsville, and Dennison; and red light camera\n\nimages from Trotwood and Dayton.\n\n\n          {¶ 6} Dorothy Verhovec initially testified at her deposition that she had “no idea” why\n\nshe signed the letter requesting the city council documents and recordings from the City. Later\n\nin her deposition, however, Mrs. Verhovec testified that she signed the letter to help her husband\n\nbecause he was ill. Mrs. Verhovec supposedly did not know and did not ask her husband why he\n\nwanted the records. Mrs. Verhovec also testified that she signed other public record request\n\nletters to help her husband but she had no idea why he was seeking the records.\n\n\n          {¶ 7} Mr. Verhovec testified at deposition that he wrote the letter, ultimately signed by\n\nhis wife, requesting the city council documents and recordings. Mr. Verhovec authored the\n\nrequest with the purported intention of being compensated under his contract with attorney\n\nCushion. Mr. Verhovec further testified at deposition that, with respect to the cable television\n\nsurvey cards, he had no interest in the records other than he “hoped to interest Mr. Cushion in\n\nthose.”\n\n\nC.        The City’s Response to the August 21, 2010 Request and April 18, 2011 Request\n\n\n          {¶ 8} The City provided Dorothy Verhovec with access to all the requested records that\n\nwere in its possession; but admittedly, certain audiocassettes containing council meetings had\n\nbeen reused and the handwritten notes of the council meetings were not retained by the city.\n\n\n          {¶ 9} On July 1, 2011, the City made the cable television survey cards and responses\n\navailable to Edward Verhovec for inspection. However, Mr. Verhovec had already filed his\n\nmandamus and civil forfeiture lawsuit four days earlier, on June 27, 2011.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                               5\n\n\nD.     The Lawsuits\n\n\n       {¶ 10} Following inspection of the city council records by the Verhovecs, Dorothy\n\nVerhovec filed her lawsuit seeking both a writ of mandamus compelling the City to provide\n\naccess to all the requested records, and a civil forfeiture claim for every record that had been lost\n\nor destroyed. As mentioned above, Edward Verhovec filed his lawsuit seeking mandamus and\n\ncivil forfeiture just four days prior to the City providing access to all of the requested cable\n\ntelevision survey cards and responses.\n\n\nE.     Edward Verhovec’s Other Lawsuits\n\n\n       {¶ 11} In discovery it was revealed that Edward Verhovec has made numerous other\n\npublic record requests and has filed many other lawsuits in the state seeking civil forfeiture\n\nawards. For instance, Edward Verhovec testified at deposition that, in addition to the records\n\nsought from the City of Marietta, he had sought public records from the following six Ohio\n\ncities: Trotwood, Northwood, Springfield, Hamilton, South Euclid, and Dayton. Mr. Verhovec\n\nhas also filed lawsuits against Northwood, Springfield, Trotwood, and Dayton in connection to\n\nthose requests. In each of those cases, Mr. Verhovec has been represented by appellant Walker.\n\n\nF.     Evidence of a State-Wide Scheme\n\n\n       {¶ 12} The City also presented evidence to the trial court suggesting that the Verhovecs’\n\nlawsuits are part of a larger, state-wide scheme involving several individuals seeking “windfall\n\nforfeiture awards” in connection to public record requests. For instance, the City notes that\n\nattorney Cushion is the named plaintiff in his own public records case in which he is represented\n\nby the Verhovecs’ counsel, appellant Walker. See State ex rel. Cushion v. Massillon, 5th Dist.\n\nStark No. 2010CA00199, 2011-Ohio-4749. The City has also identified a similar contract\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                                                6\n\n\nbetween attorney Cushion and Timothy Rhodes, pertaining to red light traffic photo enforcement\n\nrecords from the City of Chillicothe. Mr. Rhodes testified at deposition that he was also solicited\n\nout of the blue by attorney Cushion to obtain those records. The Rhodes-Cushion contract\n\nultimately resulted in Rhodes filing a mandamus and civil forfeiture lawsuit against Chillicothe.\n\nNotably, Walker represented Rhodes in the Chillicothe lawsuit.3 Rhodes was also the relator in\n\nthe Supreme Court of Ohio public records case, Rhodes v. New Philadelphia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">304</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2011-Ohio-3279, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in which he was represented by Walker.\n\n\n         {¶ 13} Edward Verhovec also testified at deposition that he solicited his nephew, James\n\nVerhovec, to send public record requests and to file lawsuits seeking mandamus and civil\n\nforfeiture relief. Letters that are virtually identical to the request made by Dorothy Verhovec in\n\nher August 21, 2010 letter, that were prepared by Edward Verhovec, but signed by James\n\nVerhovec, were sent to the city of Uhrichsville and the village of Dennison.4 Those requests\n\neventually resulted in lawsuits, filed by attorney Walker, that are almost identical to this case.\n\nSee State of Ohio ex rel. James Verhovec v. The Village of Dennison, et al., Tuscarawas County\n\nCommon Pleas Court, No. 2011CV060708, and State of Ohio ex rel. James Verhovec v. The City\n\nof Uhrichsville, et al., Tuscarawas County Common Pleas Court, No. 2011CV060707.\n\n\n         {¶ 14} The City has also identified numerous other lawsuits in the State of Ohio in\n\nwhich Walker has represented individuals seeking civil forfeiture claims related to public records\n\nrequests. See State ex rel. Davila v. Bellefontaine, 3rd Dist. Logan No. 8-11-01, 2011-Ohio-\n\n4890; State ex rel. Bell v. London, 12th Dist. Madison Nos.

The Disposition of the Underlying Claims\n\n\n       {¶ 15} The trial court granted the City summary judgment on Dorothy Verhovec’s\n\nmandamus and forfeiture claims, finding, inter alia, that the City had produced all of the records\n\nin its possession and that Dorothy was not “aggrieved.” That decision is on appeal to this court in\n\nCase No. 12CA32. The trial court also granted the City judgment on the pleadings on Edward\n\nVerhovec’s mandamus and forfeiture claims, finding that the claims were moot because the City\n\nhad produced all of the requested records (the cable television survey cards and responses).\n\n\nH.     Edward Verhovec’s Motion for Statutory Damages, Court Costs, and Attorney’s Fees\n\n\n       {¶ 16} Following the disposition of his underlying claims, Edward Verhovec filed a\n\nmotion seeking statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees.\n\n\nI.     The City’s Request for Sanctions\n\n\n       {¶ 17} Also following the disposition of the underlying lawsuits, the City moved for an\n\naward of fees and sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11 on the grounds that the lawsuits\n\nwere frivolous and brought in bad faith. The Verhovecs’ each subsequently filed an original\n\naction in this court seeking a writ of prohibition to prevent the trial court from applying R.C.\n\n2323.51 (See State ex rel. Edward Verhovec v. Washington County Common Pleas Court, et al.,\n\n4th Dist. Washington No. 12CA43, and State ex rel. Dorothy Verhovec v. Washington County\n\nCommon Pleas Court, et al., 4th Dist. Washington No. 12CA44). We dismissed the Verhovecs’\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                         8\n\n\noriginal actions on December 17, 2012, and they have both appealed those dismissals to the Ohio\n\nSupreme Court.\n\n\nJ.     The Trial Court’s December 12, 2012 Decision\n\n\n       {¶ 18} On September 10, 2012, the trial court held a joint hearing on both Edward\n\nVerhovec’s motion for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees; and on the City’s\n\nmotion for sanctions. On December 12, 2012, the trial court issued a decision, which among\n\nother things, denied Edward’s motion, and granted the City’s motion for sanctions. The trial\n\ncourt found the Verhovecs’ lawsuits were frivolous and warranted sanctions under both R.C.\n\n2323.51 and Civil Rule 11:\n\n\n       Their objective is to prove the destruction or loss of the documents so that they\n       can collect forfeiture payments and attorney fees under the Public Record Law.\n       The Court finds that such action constitutes frivolous conduct which warrants the\n       award of attorney fees and costs. The Court finds that such conduct violates Civil\n       Rule 11.\n[December 12, 2012 Decision at 18.]\n\n\n       {¶ 19} To that end, the trial court issued sanctions of $32,974.51 in Edward’s case, and\n\n$274,033.49 as sanctions in Dorothy’s case, to reimburse the City’s costs and attorney’s fees\n\nincurred in defending the lawsuits. The trial court issued the sanctions jointly against the\n\nVerhovecs and appellant Walker under R.C. 2323.51, and individually against appellant Walker\n\nunder Civil Rule 11.\n\n\nK.     The Consolidated Appeals\n\n\n       {¶ 20} The two underlying lawsuits have resulted in five appeals which we have\n\nconsolidated; as well as the separate appeal in Case No. 12CA32.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                            9\n\n\n       {¶ 21} In September 2011, the trial court issued a decision awarding judgment on the\n\npleadings in favor of the City on Edward’s mandamus and forfeiture claims because his claims\n\nhad been rendered moot by the City’s production of all the requested records. Before the trial\n\ncourt journalized its decision, Edward moved the court for an award of statutory damages, court\n\ncosts, and attorney’s fees pursuant to R.C. 149.43(C)(1). Without ruling on Edward’s motion,\n\nthe trial court journalized its Entry of Dismissal. Edward subsequently appealed from the Entry\n\nof Dismissal (Case No. 11CA29). On appeal, we remanded the case so that the trial court could\n\ndispose of Edward’s remaining claims of statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees.\n\nEdward moved for summary judgment on those remaining claims in July 2012.\n\n\n       {¶ 22} In June and July 2012, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the\n\nCity on Dorothy’s mandamus and forfeiture claims. Dorothy has appealed that decision (Case\n\nNo. 12CA32).\n\n\n       {¶ 23} In August 2012, the City moved for fees and sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 and\n\nCivil Rule 11 in both of the underlying lawsuits. The trial court subsequently consolidated the\n\nlawsuits and held an evidentiary hearing on September 10, 2012.\n\n\n       {¶ 24} On November 13, 2012, the trial court issued a decision granting the City’s\n\nmotion for sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11 and denying Edward’s motion for\n\nstatutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees. The decision also disposed of all other\n\npending motions. On December 12, 2012, appellants filed appeals from that decision, even\n\nthough the trial court had yet to journalize its decision (Case Nos. 12CA52, 12CA53).\n\n\n       {¶ 25} Also on December 12, 2012, the trial court issued an amended decision that was\n\nidentical to its November 13, 2012 decision, except that it made relatively minor revisions in the\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                         10\n\n\nfee award calculations. The trial court entered its final judgment on December 19, 2012. The\n\nappellants filed appeals from the final judgment on January 11, 2013 (Case Nos. 13CA1,\n\n13CA2).\n\n\n          {¶ 26} Meanwhile, we returned Edward’s appeal on the statutory damages issues (Case\n\nNo. 11CA29) to our active docket by Magistrate’s Order dated December 18, 2012.\n\n\n          {¶ 27} As aforementioned, the appeal of Edward’s statutory damages issues (Case No.\n\n11CA29), the two pre-mature appeals based on the un-journalized November 13, 2012 decision\n\n(Case Nos. 12CA52, 12CA53), and the two appeals based on the December 2012 decision and\n\njudgment entry (Case Nos. 13CA1, 13CA2) were consolidated.\n\n\n                                                   II.\n\n\n                                      ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n\n          {¶ 28} In Case Nos. 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, and 13CA2, appellants Dorothy\n\nVerhovec, Edward Verhovec, and William E. Walker, Jr., raise eight assignments of error for our\n\nreview.\n\n\nFirst Assignment of Error:\n\n          THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO THE APPELLANTS’ PREJUDICE WHEN IT\n          MADE AN EX POST FACTO APPLICATION OF R.C. 149.351(C) TO\n          CREATE LIABILITY RETROSPECTIVELY BASED ON THE SUBJECTIVE\n          INTENT OF APPELLANTS IN VIOLATION OF R.C. 1.48 AND OHIO\n          CONSTITUTITION SECTION 28, ARTICLE II.\nSecond Assignment of Error:\n\n          THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO APPELLANTS’ PREJUDICE AND ABUSED\n          ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT FOUND THAT APPELLANTS ACTED\n          FRIVOLOUSLY WHEN THAT FINDING WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY ANY\n          COMPETENT, CREDIBLE EVIDENCE BUT WAS INSTEAD BASED UPON\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2             11\n\n\n       AN INFERENCE DRAWN SOLELY FROM ANOTHER INFERENCE IN\n       VIOLATION OF EVID.R. 702.\nThird Assignment of Error:\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO APPELLANTS’ PREJUDICE AND ABUSED\n       ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT ALLOWED APPELLEES TO PRESENT\n       CHARACTER AND “OTHER ACTS” EVIDENCE OVER OBJECTION, AND\n       USED THAT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT ITS FINDINGS THAT\n       PETITIONERS ACTED IN CONFORMANCE TO CHARACTER, IN\n       VIOLATION OF EVID.R. 404.\nFourth Assignment of Error:\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO APPELLANTS’ PREJUDICE AND ABUSED\n       ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT FOUND THAT APPELLANTS WERE A R.C.\n       2323.51 PARTY SUBJECT TO SANCTIONS; EVEN THOUGH THE STATE\n       IS THE REAL PARTY IN INTEREST; BECAUSE R.C. 2731.04 REQUIRES\n       MANDAMUS ACTIONS TO BE MADE IN THE NAME OF THE STATE;\n       AND THE CIV.R. 17(A) COMMANDS THAT EVERY ACTION SHALL BE\n       PROSECUTED IN THE NAME OF THE REAL PARTY IN INTEREST.\nFifth Assignment of Error:\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO APPELLANTS’ PREJUDICE WHEN IT\n       ADJUDICATED A R.C. 2323.51 MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AND FOUND\n       EACH OF THEM LIABLE WITHOUT HAVING SUBJECT MATTER\n       JURISDICTION; BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING MATTER WAS NOT AN\n       ORDINARY PROCEEDING BUT A SPECIAL PROCEEDING AND AS SUCH\n       WAS NOT ONE OF THE CLASS OF CASES THAT THE TRIAL COURT\n       COULD HEAR, IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 4(B), ARTICLE IV, OF THE\n       OHIO CONSTITUTION.\nSixth Assignment of Error:\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO APPELLANTS’ PREJUDICE AND ABUSED\n       ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT OVERRULED EDWARD’S MOTION TO\n       STRIKE APPELLEES’ R.C. 2323.51 MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST\n       EDWARD WHEN APPELLEES’ MOTION FAILED TO SATISFY THE\n       JURISDICTIONAL TIME REQUIREMENT BY NOT BEING FILED WITHIN\n       30 DAYS AFTER FINAL JUDGMENT, IN VIOLATION OF R.C.\n       2323.51(B)(1).\nSeventh Assignment of Error:\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO APPELLANTS’ PREJUDICE AND ABUSED\n       ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT FOUND THAT R.C. 2323.51 SANCTIONS\n       WERE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THAT FINDING WAS NOT SUPPORTED\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                            12\n\n\n       BY COMPETENT, CREDIBLE EVIDENCE GOING TO ALL THE\n       ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE CASE BECAUSE APPELLEES FAILED\n       TO SHOW THAT THEY PROVIDED ACCESS TO ALL THE REQUESTED\n       RECORDS AND THEY FAILED TO SHOW THAT THEY HAD NOT\n       UNLAWFULLY DESTROYED THOSE RECORDS.\nEighth Assignment of Error:\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO WALKER’S PREJUDICE AND ABUSED\n       ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT IMPOSED SANCTIONS FOR FRIVOLOUS\n       CONDUCT WHEN APPELLEES FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT\n       CONDUCT CAUSED WHICH EXPENSES; IN VIOLATION OF R.C.\n       2323.51(B)(5).\n       {¶ 29} As it pertains to Case No. 11CA29, Edward Verhovec raises two assignments of\n\nerror for our review.\n\n\nFirst Assignment of Error:\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW IN NOT GRANTING\n       SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO RELATOR/APPELLANT AFTER REMAND.\nSecond Assignment of Error:\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW AND ABUSED ITS\n       DISCRETION IN DENYING RELATOR/APPELLANT’S R.C. 149.43(C)(1)\n       MOTION FOR DAMAGES, COSTS AND ATTORNEY FEES BECAUSE R.C.\n       149.43(C)(2)(b)(i) REQUIRED THE COURT TO MAKE THAT AWARD.\n                                                    III.\n\n\n                                           LAW & ANALYSIS\n\n\nA.     Edward Verhovec’s Motion for Statutory Damages, Court Costs, and\n\n       Attorney’s Fees\n\n\n       {¶ 30} We first consider Edward Verhovec’s two assignments of error pertaining to the\n\ntrial court’s denial of his motion for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees in case\n\nnumber 11OT197. Because the two assignments of error are interrelated – in that they both\n\nargue that the trial court erred as a matter of law – we consider them together.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                             13\n\n\n       {¶ 31} R.C. 149.43(B)(1) provides, in relevant part, that “[u]pon request and subject to\n\ndivision (B)(8) of this section, all public records responsive to the request shall be promptly\n\nprepared and made available for inspection to any person at all reasonable times during regular\n\nbusiness hours.” If the public office fails to make the public records promptly available, then the\n\nrequester may file a mandamus action seeking an order to compel the public office to make the\n\nrecords available. R.C. 149.43(C)(1).\n\n\n       {¶ 32} A mandamus claim is rendered moot when a relator has received all of the\n\nrequested public records or has been given access to all of the records.

The City did\n\nnot immediately respond to Mr. Verhovec’s request, so on June 27, 2011, he commenced the\n\ninstant action for mandamus and civil forfeiture relief.\n\n\n       {¶ 36} Four days after the lawsuit was filed, on July 1, 2011, the City responded to the\n\nrequest and notified Mr. Verhovec that the records were available for inspection. Shortly\n\nthereafter, Edward Verhovec moved for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees.\n\n\n       {¶ 37} Meanwhile, at all times relevant to this matter, the City had a public records\n\npolicy that required it to acknowledge, in writing, all public record requests within three business\n\ndays following the public office’s receipt of the request. It is undisputed that the City did not\n\ncomply with its policy, and did not acknowledge receipt of the request in writing.\n\n\n       {¶ 38} Edward Verhovec first contends that the City’s failure to comply with its public\n\nrecords policy -requiring the public office to acknowledge a records request within three\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                             17\n\n\nbusiness days – was tantamount to the City’s failure to promptly provide access to the requested\n\nrecords as required by R.C. 149.43(B)(1). Appellant concludes that the trial court erred in not\n\nawarding him summary judgment, because as a matter of law, he was entitled to statutory\n\ndamages, court costs, and attorney’s fees under R.C. 149.43(C)(1)-(2).\n\n\n          {¶ 39} Edward’s first argument fails, however, because in order to recover damages,\n\ncosts, or fees under the Public Records Act, one must first prove a violation of the Act.\n\nStrothers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2012-Ohio-1007, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at ¶ 21 (“An award of statutory\n\ndamages under R.C. 149.43(C)(1) is premised on a violation of R.C. 149.43(B).”). Simply put,\n\nbefore one may recover damages, costs, or fees, he must demonstrate that the respondent did not\n\nact promptly in responding to the request.\n\n\n          {¶ 40} Here, Edward leaps to the conclusion that because the City failed to adhere to its\n\nacknowledgement policy, than it also failed to act promptly; and thus, he was entitled to\n\ndamages, costs, and fees as a matter of law. Edward’s analysis, however, plainly contradicts\n\nestablished case law, which consistently has held that the determination of whether a public\n\noffice or person responsible for public records has acted promptly is dependent upon the facts\n\nand circumstances of the case.

Thus, the proper inquiry is whether\n\nthe trial court, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, abused its discretion in concluding that\n\nthe City “promptly” responded to the request – an inquiry which appellant does not make on\n\nappeal.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                                              18\n\n\n        {¶ 41} Thus, when viewed in the proper context, the factual issue of whether the City\n\npromptly responded to the request precluded summary judgment relief. Moreover, Edward’s\n\nargument that the City’s noncompliance with its acknowledgment policy resulted in a statutory\n\nbreach under the Act is also without merit and does not provide a basis to recover under\n\nsummary judgment.5\n\n\n        {¶ 42} Edward next argues that the trial court improperly determined that he was not\n\nentitled to damages, costs, or attorney’s fees because he was not “aggrieved.” While the trial\n\ncourt decision did discuss the aggrievement issue; the trial court’s analysis of that issue formed\n\nthe basis for its decision to issue sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11. The trial court\n\nnever ruled, as appellant suggests, that it declined to award damages, costs, or fees on the basis\n\nthat Edward was not “aggrieved.” Rather, the trial court’s decision not to award damages, costs,\n\nand fees was based on the fact that the City promptly made the records available under the\n\nunique facts and circumstances of the case; and on its decision to exercise its discretion under the\n\nAct not to award the relief requested.6 Edward’s aggreivement argument is simply misplaced.\n\n        {¶ 43} Based on the foregoing, it cannot be said that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nin denying Edward’s motion for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees.\n\nAccordingly, Edward’s first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\n\nB.      The Judgment Imposing Sanctions Under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Edward argued that R.C. 149.43(B)(7) imposed a statutory duty on the City to comply with its acknowledgment\npolicy. That provision, however, simply requires public offices to comply with internal policies regarding the\ntransmission of records “by United States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission pursuant to this\ndivision.” The provision does not create a statutory duty for public offices to comply with any other policies\npertaining to public records.\n6\n  See R.C. 149.43(C)(1) and (2), supra, granting the court discretion to decrease or decline an award of damages and\nfees even where a public office has violated the Act.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                        19\n\n\n       {¶ 44} The remaining assignments of error raised by appellants Edward Verhovec,\n\nDorothy Verhovec, and William E. Walker, Jr., pertain to the trial court’s award of attorney’s\n\nfees and costs as sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11.\n\n\n       {¶ 45} R.C. 2323.51 governs the award of attorney’s fees as a sanction for frivolous\n\nconduct. R.C. 2323.51(A)(2) defines “frivolous conduct” to mean:\n\n\n       (a) Conduct of [a] * * * party to a civil action, * * * or of the * * * party’s counsel\n       of record that satisfies any of the following:\n       (i) It obviously serves merely to harass or maliciously injure another party to the\n       civil action or appeal or is for another improper purpose, including, but not\n       limited to, causing unnecessary delay or a needless increase in the cost of\n       litigation.\n       (ii) It is not warranted under existing law, cannot be supported by a good faith\n       argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, or cannot be\n       supported by a good faith argument for the establishment of new law.\n       (iii) The conduct consists of allegations or other factual contentions that have no\n       evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are not likely to have\n       evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or\n       discovery.\n       (iv) The conduct consists of denials or factual contentions that are not warranted\n       by the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are not reasonably based on a lack\n       of information or belief.\n       {¶ 46} R.C. 2323.51(B) authorizes a trial court to award attorney’s fees to any party\n\nadversely affected by frivolous conduct; however, section (B)(1) specifies that a party make a\n\nmotion for such award “not more than thirty days after the entry of final judgment in a civil\n\naction or appeal.”\n\n\n       {¶ 47} “Courts must carefully apply R.C. 2323.51 ‘so that legitimate claims are not\n\nchilled.’ ” Burchett v.

Despite appellants’ arguments, the City was able to put forth sufficient\n\nevidence that the Verhovecs, and appellant Walker, feigned their intent to access the public\n\nrecords through the guise of the Cushion contract when their actual intent was to seek forfeiture\n\nawards. Such conduct is frivolous because the lawsuits were brought for an “improper purpose,”\n\nand because the Verhovecs were not “aggrieved” persons for purposes of civil forfeiture\n\ndamages as that term was defined by the Ohio Supreme Court in State ex rel. Rhodes v. New\n\nPhiladelphia.\n\n\n          {¶ 62} All of the evidence in the instant case indicates that the appellants are involved in\n\nan intricate scheme to take advantage of the Public Records Act, specifically the civil forfeiture\n\nprovision, by seeking to prove the improper destruction of voluminous and archaic public\n\nrecords. The only explanation offered by the appellants to rebut this conclusion, is that the\n\nrecords were sought by Edward Verhovec to fulfill his contracts with attorney Cushion. Yet, Mr.\n\nVerhovec testified that he was unsure of what exactly needed to be produced in order to collect\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                           25\n\n\npayment under the contracts. Moreover, it is undisputed that the cable television survey cards\n\nand responses were not required to be produced for any Cushion contract. Mr. Verhovec tried to\n\nexplain that he sought the cable television records because he thought they may interest Mr.\n\nCushion. Yet, even after learning that Cushion was not interested in the records he still pursued\n\nhis lawsuit for civil forfeiture damages; and after he verified that all the survey cards were\n\npresent, he no longer had any interest in the cards. Mr. Verhovec has also filed numerous other\n\nlawsuits throughout the state seeking forfeiture damages. Absent the Cushion contracts, there\n\nare no logical explanations for these lawsuits. The Verhovecs are not historians. They have\n\nnever resided in the City of Marietta. Mr. Verhovec had not even heard of the Public Records\n\nAct prior to being contacted by attorney Cushion “out of the blue.” Mr. Verhovec is also the\n\ndriving force behind the lawsuits filed by his nephew, James Verhovec, against the Village of\n\nDennison and the City of Uhrichville. Those lawsuits also seek significant forfeiture damages.\n\nWe also cannot ignore the connections between Walker and Cushion. Walker represented\n\nCushion in Cushion’s very own civil forfeiture lawsuit. Walker also represented Timothy\n\nRhodes in the Chillicothe lawsuit, in which Rhodes allegedly sought the records to fulfill his\n\ncontract with Cushion. Finally, Walker represents James Verhovec in his lawsuits against\n\nUhrichsville and Dennison.\n\n\n       {¶ 63} The lawsuits at issue in this case, the James Verhovec lawsuits, and the Timothy\n\nRhodes Chillicothe lawsuit were all allegedly commenced so that the parties could retrieve the\n\nnecessary documents required under the Cushion contracts. Both Rhodes and Edward Verhovec\n\nwere allegedly contacted out of the blue by attorney Cushion; and while the Verhovecs’ deny\n\nhaving a relationship with Rhodes both the Verhovecs and Rhodes are represented by Walker.\n\nMoreover, Walker has represented Cushion in Cushion’s very own public records lawsuit.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                                              26\n\n\nAppellants would have us believe that this is a matter of coincidence; but we cannot ignore the\n\nconnections. Based on the foregoing evidence, the trial court’s conclusion that the appellants’\n\ntrue intent was to prove the nonexistence of the records so that they could collect the forfeiture\n\nawards is reasonable; and, it is a conclusion that we share with the trial court.8 As such, there is\n\nno doubt that the lawsuits were frivolous, as the law defines that term.\n\n\n         {¶ 64} In sum, we conclude that the appellants have no interest in the requested records\n\nother than to build a case for forfeiture and reimbursement of attorney’s fees. To the extent that\n\nour conclusion rests on any inferences, they are reasonable inferences that are supported by the\n\nrecord. In light of the foregoing, the trial court correctly concluded that the appellants acted\n\nfrivolously by pursuing litigation for such an improper purpose.\n\n\n         {¶ 65} Appellants also contend that it is improper to consider their motives for\n\nrequesting the records when determining whether their conduct is frivolous. In the context of a\n\nmandamus claim, the requester’s motive is indeed irrelevant. See New Philadelphia, 129 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 304, 2011-Ohio-3279, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at ¶ 20 (“[A] public office is obligated to honor a\n\nrecords request by ‘any person’ and that a person does not have to explain his or her reasons for\n\nwanting to inspect and copy a public record in order to validity request the record.”); see also\n\nR.C. 149.43(B)(4) (prohibiting public office from conditioning availability of records by\n\nrequiring disclosure of the requestor’s identity or purpose). However, both of the lawsuits also\n\nsought civil forfeiture damages. While “any person” may make a public records request under\n\nR.C. 149.43(B), the Supreme Court of Ohio has rejected the notion that “any person” can recover\n\n8\n At least one other Ohio court has alluded to a similar scheme involving Rhodes, and others.

Accordingly,\n\nwe reject appellants’ argument and overrule their third assignment of error.\n\n\n       {¶ 72} For their fourth assignment of error, appellants’ contend that they are immune\n\nfrom sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 because they are not purportedly the real party interest.\n\nInstead, they contend that the State of Ohio is the real party in interest because the Verhovecs\n\nbrought their actions in mandamus.\n\n\n       {¶ 73} R.C. 2323.51(B)(4) provides that: “An award made pursuant to division (B)(1) of\n\nthis section may be made against a party, the party’s counsel of record, or both.” Appellants\n\ncontend that since the lawsuits were required to be brought in the name of the state on relation of\n\nthe petitioner, the state, and not the petitioner, is the party for purposes of R.C. 2323.51.\n\n\n       {¶ 74} Appellants, however, completely ignore existing case law from the Ohio Supreme\n\nCourt, which upheld sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 against a party that brought a mandamus\n\naction to compel public records under R.C. 149.43. See State ex rel. Striker v. Cline, 130 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 214, 2011-Ohio-5350, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Furthermore, appellants have not cited a single case\n\nin support of the proposition that a requestor bringing a mandamus action under the Public\n\nRecords Act is immune from sanctions under R.C. 2323.51.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                              29\n\n\n        {¶ 75} Rather, the case law cited by appellants’ supports the proposition that where the\n\nobject of a mandamus action is to enforce a public right, the state is regarded as the real party in\n\ninterest. But here, in addition to their mandamus actions, appellants sought civil forfeiture\n\nawards, statutory damages, attorney’s fees, and costs. The intended purpose of the lawsuits was\n\nto line the appellants’ pockets to the detriment of the City; not to serve a broader public interest\n\nof the state.\n\n\n        {¶ 76} Accordingly, appellants’ argument that they are immune from sanctions for their\n\nfrivolous conduct simply because their claims sound in mandamus is without merit. Their fourth\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n        {¶ 77} For their fifth assignment of error, appellants’ contend that the trial court lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction to award sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 because that statute applies\n\nonly to “civil actions” and a mandamus action is not a “civil action.”\n\n\n        {¶ 78} The Verhovecs made nearly identical arguments to this court in their prohibition\n\nactions (Case Nos. 12CA43, 12CA44). In those cases, we expressly rejected the argument, and\n\ninstead we held that a mandamus action under the Public Records Act is a “civil action” for\n\npurposes of R.C. 2323.51:\n\n\n        * * * Verhovec alleges that the trial court and Judge Boyer do not have\n        jurisdiction to address the merits of Marietta’s sanction motion under R.C.\n        2323.51, because that statutory provision applies only to “civil actions” and a\n        mandamus action is not a “civil action.” Verhovec is wrong for two reasons.\n        First, a mandamus action is a civil action.

That order, however, was not a “final\n\njudgment.”\n\n\n       {¶ 82} The time period for filing a frivolous conduct claim under R.C. 2323.51 runs\n\nfrom the entry of the “final appealable order.” Soler v.

Furthermore, the September 26,\n\n2011 Order did not satisfy the requirements of Civ.R. 54, because it disposed of fewer than all of\n\nthe claims and it did not certify that there were no just reason for delay. Thus, the September 26,\n\n2011 Order was not a “final appealable order,” and it did not trigger the 30-day deadline under\n\nR.C. 2323.51.\n\n\n       {¶ 85} Appellants’ argument that the September 26, 2011 order was labeled a “final\n\nappealable order,” is also without merit. A trial court’s labeling of an entry as a “final\n\nappealable order,” is not dispositive of the issue.

The trial court did not enter final judgment\n\nin that case until December 17, 2012. The City’s motion was clearly filed within the statutory\n\ndeadline. Accordingly, we overrule appellants’ sixth assignment of error.\n\n\n       {¶ 87} For their seventh assignment of error, appellants’ contend that the trial court erred\n\nin finding the lawsuits frivolous under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11, because such a finding was\n\nnot supported by “competent, credible evidence.”\n\n\n       {¶ 88} We have already concluded, in response to appellants’ second assignment of\n\nerror, that the appellants’ conduct was frivolous. We noted that our conclusion was supported by\n\nsufficient evidence in the record, and was not the result of speculation or inference stacking. We\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                              33\n\n\ndefer to our analysis above, and hold that there is adequate evidence to support a finding of\n\nfrivolousness under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11.\n\n\n       {¶ 89} Appellants’ further contend that their mandamus claims were legitimate, and thus\n\nnot frivolous, because (1) the City did not respond to Edward’s request until four days after the\n\nfiling of suit; and (2) the City did not provide Dorothy with all of the requested records.\n\nHowever, appellants’ lawsuits also contained a claim for civil forfeiture, and it is clear that they\n\nhad no interest in the records other than to prove their destruction so that they could collect\n\nforfeiture awards and attorney’s fees. The mandamus claims were simply a prerequisite to\n\nobtaining forfeiture awards for the allegedly destroyed records.\n\n\n        {¶ 90} In sum, there is sufficient evidence in the record demonstrating a contrived and\n\nconcerted effort amongst the Verhovecs, attorney Walker, attorney Cushion, and others, to take\n\nadvantage of the civil forfeiture statute for purely pecuniary gain. Appellant’s seventh\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n       {¶ 91} For their eighth and final assignment of error, appellants’ contend that the trial\n\ncourt erred by failing to segregate out the specific fees that were attributable to the appellants’\n\nfrivolous conduct. In their own words: “ * * * Appellees failed to show what conduct caused\n\nwhich expenses. * * * Therefore, it cannot be determined which expenses were reasonably\n\nincurred by what frivolous conduct.”\n\n\n       {¶ 92} Appellants’ argument focuses on the fact that the City did not identify which\n\nattorney’s fees were attributable to the mandamus claims, and which fees were attributable to the\n\ndefense of the forfeiture claims. Essentially, appellants’ argument is premised on the notion that\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                             34\n\n\nthe mandamus claims were not frivolous, and thus, the City is not entitled to reimbursement of\n\nthe cost to defend those claims (see assignment of error seven).\n\n\n       {¶ 93} As noted above, a trial court’s award of attorney’s fees as sanctions under R.C.\n\n2323.51, is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Similarly, an award of attorney’s fees under\n\nCiv.R. 11 is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard of review.\n\n\n       {¶ 94} Here, the trial court found that the lawsuits were frivolous in their entirety.\n\nBecause the trial court determined that the lawsuits were entirely frivolous, it was not necessary\n\nto determine which fees were attributable to the defense of the mandamus claims, and which fees\n\nwere attributable to the forfeiture claims. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion. Appellants’ eighth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                                     IV.\n\n\n                                              CONCLUSION\n\n\n       {¶ 95} For the foregoing reasons, appellant Edward Verhovec’s two assignments of error\n\npertaining to the denial of his motion for statutory damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees are\n\noverruled. Likewise, appellants’ joint assignments of error relating to the imposition of sanctions\n\nagainst them for frivolous conduct are also overruled. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                                         JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n\fWashington App. Nos. 11CA29, 12CA52, 12CA53, 13CA1, 13CA2                                           35\n\n\n                                       JUDGMENT ENTRY\n\n\n         It is ordered that the JUDGMENT BE AFFIRMED.
