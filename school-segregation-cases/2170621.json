SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n\n\n      This is a consolidated case involving three Mississippi school\n\ndistricts: the Lauderdale County School District (\"Lauderdale\"),\n\nthe Enterprise School District (\"Enterprise\"), and the Quitman\n\nSchool District (\"Quitman\").              The magistrate judge ordered the\n\ntransfer of certain students from Enterprise to Lauderdale and from\n\nQuitman to Enterprise.           We reverse these transfers, but we affirm\n\nthe   other     portions    of    the    judgment,   regarding   interdistrict\n\npayments and the annexation of the Stonewall area by Quitman.\n\n\n\n                                    I.    Facts.\n\n      In 1953, the Mississippi legislature passed a law reorganizing\n\nthe state school system in order to provide separate but equal\n\neducation for white and black students.              1953 Miss. Laws, Extraor-\n\ndinary Session, ch. 12. All of the school districts in Mississippi\n\nwere reorganized by July 1, 1957.             The three school districts that\n\nare parties to this case are Lauderdale, which encompasses all of\n\nLauderdale County except for the City of Meridian; Enterprise,\n\nwhich encompasses the northern third of Clarke County; and Quitman,\n\nencompassing the southern two-thirds of Clarke County.              Lauderdale\n\nCounty borders Clarke County on the north.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Circuit Judge of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n                                          2\n\f              A.   Clarkdale School:       Pre-desegregation.\n\n      Under the 1953 reorganization, Lauderdale County was divided\n\ninto two school districts, the Meridian Municipal Separate School\n\nDistrict, encompassing the City of Meridian and the surrounding\n\narea, and Lauderdale, encompassing the remainder of Lauderdale\n\nCounty.   The pre-reorganization Clarkdale Line Consolidated School\n\nDistrict, which had included territory in both Lauderdale and\n\nClarke counties, was abolished and its territory placed under\n\ncontrol of Lauderdale.       The unincorporated area of Meehan, located\n\nin Lauderdale County along the border of Clarke County, was also\n\nbrought under Lauderdale's control.\n\n      The Clarkdale school,2 a de jure white school during segrega-\n\ntion, straddles the border between Lauderdale County and Clarke\n\nCounty.    For a number of years, Enterprise and Lauderdale entered\n\ninto one-year agreements regarding the ownership and operation of\n\nClarkdale. On February 13, 1962, Lauderdale and Enterprise entered\n\ninto a    twenty-five-year      agreement    (the   \"Clarkdale     agreement\")\n\nproviding that white students from northeastern Clarke County would\n\nattend the Clarkdale school and that approximately 100 students in\n\nthe Meehan area in Lauderdale would attend the all-white Enterprise\n\nschool in the western part of the Enterprise district.3\n\n\n     2\n       The parties sometimes refer to a school as an \"attendance center,\" e.g.,\n\"the Clarkdale Attendance Center.\"\n      3\n         The Clarkdale agreement provided, among other things, that Lauderdale\nwould operate the Clarkdale school; that Enterprise would take over the operation\nof the school if Enterprise acquired a 51% or greater ownership of the property\nof the school; that before any principals or teachers were hired at Clarkdale,\nLauderdale would submit their names to Enterprise 30 days before hiring them;\n                                                               (continued...)\n\n                                       3\n\f      Before       desegregation,      Lauderdale    had   one    black   school,\n\nMiddleton, which served the entire district.                It had four white\n\nschools:           Northwest    (now     West),   Northeast,     Southeast,   and\n\nClarkdale.\n\n\n\n                      B.    Stonewall:    Pre-desegregation.\n\n      Under Mississippi's 1953 reorganization plan, Clarke County\n\nwas reorganized into two districts: the Clarke County Consolidated\n\nSchool       District      (later   Enterprise)   and   Quitman.      Enterprise\n\ncomprised the northern part of the county, including an area called\n\n\"Northeast Clarke County,\" the town of Enterprise, the town of\n\nStonewall, and the area surrounding Stonewall.4                Quitman comprised\n\n\n      3\n         (...continued)\nthat Enterprise could object to the hiring of any principals or teachers at\nClarkdale; that if Lauderdale refused to consider any such objections, the matter\nwould be submitted to binding arbitration; that the Clarkdale school would be\njointly owned by the Lauderdale County Board of Education and the Board of\nTrustees of the Clarke County Consolidated School District (later the Enterprise\nschool district); that the proportion of ownership would be based upon the\nrespective amounts of money contributed to the school by citizens in the\nrespective counties, the amount contributed by Lauderdale and the Clarke County\nConsolidated School District, and the amount of state funds allocated to either\ncounty district based upon attendance at Clarkdale; that the Clarkdale school\nshould be a \"white attendance center\" for grades one through twelve; that all\n\"eligible school children\" in Northeast Clarke County would be assigned by the\nClarke County Consolidated School District to attend Clarkdale; that all\n\"eligible school children\" in the Meehan area of Lauderdale County would attend\nthe Enterprise attendance center in the Clarke County Consolidated School\nDistrict; that each school district would pay for transportation of its students\nattending Clarkdale; that \"[a]ll state funds of every description, except\ntransportation funds, shall follow the child, and shall accrue to and be paid\ndirectly by the state to the district in which the child actually attends school,\nand for this purpose the Clarkdale Attendance Center shall be considered to be\nin the Lauderdale County School District so long as it shall operate the same\";\nthat the total cost of the school would be divided between the districts on the\nbasis of the average daily attendance of students; that the contract would be\neffective upon approval by the necessary parties and would run for a period of\n25 years; and that breach of one part of the agreement would not affect the\nbinding effect of the agreement.\n         4\n             Stonewall and the surrounding area are referred to as the \"Stonewall\narea.\"\n\n                                           4\n\fthe southern part of the county, including the town of Quitman.             In\n\naddition to the two school districts, there was the Clarke County\n\nBoard of Education, which had limited supervisory authority over\n\nthe transportation of Enterprise and Quitman students and the\n\nauthority to hear transfer appeals.\n\n       Enterprise had a white elementary school, a white high school,\n\na black elementary school, and a black high school.5             Quitman had\n\ntwo black elementary schools, one black high school, one white high\n\nschool,      one   white   lower   elementary   school,    one   white   upper\n\nelementary school, and the Stonewall School.\n\n       In 1962, Enterprise announced that it would convert the\n\nStonewall school, an all-white school, from grades 1-12 to grades\n\n1-6.       White parents in Stonewall petitioned to have the Stonewall\n\narea detached from Enterprise and annexed to Quitman.             The Quitman\n\ndistrict passed a resolution to annex the Stonewall area.                  The\n\nClarke County Board of Education tabled the Enterprise school\n\ndistrict's plan to convert the Stonewall school from grades 1-12 to\n\n1-6 and adopted a resolution detaching the Stonewall territory from\n\nEnterprise and annexing it to Quitman.\n\n       Enterprise and Quitman approved a twenty-five-year agreement\n\nproviding that all blacks in Stonewall would attend the all-black\n\nschool in Enterprise and that all state funds would be paid to the\n\ndistrict where the student attended school.               This agreement was\n\npart of a larger compromise agreement that settled litigation over\n\n\n       5\n       Enterprise Elementary School, Enterprise High School, Central Elementary\nSchool, and Central High School, respectively.\n\n                                       5\n\fownership of Stonewall.\n\n\n\n                                C.    Desegregation.\n\n     In 1963, the United States brought a desegregation suit\n\nagainst Lauderdale.             United States v. Lauderdale Sch. Dist.,\n\nNo. 1367(E) (S.D. Tex.).              In the same district court in 1965,\n\nprivate plaintiffs filed a desegregation suit against Quitman,\n\nEnterprise,        and    the     Clarke          County     Board     of    Education.\n\nKillingsworth v. Enterprise Consol. Sch. Dist., No. 1367(E) (S.D.\n\nMiss.).\n\n     In    1967,    the   district       court      in     Killingsworth     instructed\n\nQuitman and Enterprise to file desegregation plans.                           The court\n\ntentatively accepted the \"freedom of choice\" desegregation plan\n\nfiled by the school districts but, on July 19, 1967, rejected the\n\n\"freedom    of     choice\"      plans    and       entered    a     final   order     that\n\n(1) enjoined Enterprise, Quitman, and the Clarke County Board of\n\nEducation from discriminating on the basis of race or color,\n\n(2) held that Enterprise, Quitman and the Clarke County Board shall\n\ntake affirmative action \"to establish all school segregation and to\n\neliminate    the    effects      of     the   dual       system,\"    (3)    allowed   all\n\nstudents, irrespective of race or color, to exercise, every year,\n\nthe choice of which school in their district to attend, (4) held\n\nthat overcrowding of the particular school chosen will be the only\n\nreason for denying the student's choice of which school to attend,\n\nand (5) held that there will would be no more interdistrict\n\ntransfers between Enterprise and Quitman \"except on terms and by\n\n\n                                              6\n\fprocedures generally applicable regardless of race.\"                        Although\n\nasked to do so by plaintiffs in Killingsworth, the court did not\n\nfind the contract of June 11, 1962, between Enterprise and Quitman\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n     The district court consolidated Killingsworth, Lauderdale, and\n\nother pending desegregation cases.            After consolidation, the cases\n\nwere reported as United States v. Hinds County School Board.                       On\n\nJuly 3, 1969, in a consolidated appeal that included Lauderdale and\n\nKillingsworth, this court reversed and remanded, directing the\n\ndistrict courts to request the United States Department of Health,\n\nEducation, and Welfare (\"HEW\") to collaborate with the school\n\nboards to develop desegregation plans.                  United States v. Hinds\n\nCounty Sch. Bd., 417 F.2d 852, 856-59 (5th Cir. 1969), cert.\n\ndenied, 390 U.S. 1032 (1970).             If an individual school board and\n\nHEW agreed to a desegregation plan by August 11, 1969, the district\n\ncourts   were    to   implement     the    plan   if    it    met   constitutional\n\nstandards.   Id. at 858.     If no such agreement could be reached, the\n\ndistrict   courts     were   to   implement       the     HEW   plan   if    it    met\n\nconstitutional standards.         Id. at 858-59.\n\n     HEW filed its plans for all three districts on August 11,\n\n1969. On August 28, 1969, this court extended, at the government's\n\nrequest,   the    deadline    for    filing       plans      from   August    11    to\n\nDecember 1. In effect, this allowed the parties additional time to\n\nredraft the plans.      On October 29, 1969, the Supreme Court vacated\n\nthe extension of the deadline, directing this court to issue\n\ndesegregation orders immediately.             Alexander v. Holmes County Bd.\n\n\n                                          7\n\fof Educ., 396 U.S. 19, 20 (1969) (per curiam).                  At its discretion,\n\nthis court could modify and implement the government plans.                         Id.\n\nIn response to Alexander, this court ordered that all thirty\n\npermanent HEW plans prepared for school districts in the Southern\n\nDistrict of Mississippi, including Lauderdale, Enterprise, and\n\nQuitman, be implemented immediately. United States v. Hinds County\n\nSch. Bd., 423 F.2d 1264, 1267-68 (5th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396\n\nU.S. 1032 (1970).6\n\n            The August 11, 1969, HEW plan for Lauderdale contained the\n\nfollowing majority-to-minority transfer provision:\n\n            Whenever there shall exist schools containing a majority\n            of Negro students, this school district shall permit a\n            student (Negro or white) attending a school in which his\n            race is in the majority to choose to attend another\n            school where space is available, and where his race is in\n            a minority.\n\nThus, transfers between schools can occur if the student seeking\n\ntransfer is a minority in the transferee school.                      The plan also\n\ncontained          a   Singleton   provision     prohibiting    the    interdistrict\n\ntransfer          of   students    unless    the    transfers    are    done   on    a\n\n\n\n\n        6\n            This court delayed implementation of a permanent plan for Quitman for one\nyear:\n            It appearing that the lack of buildings prevents the immediate\n            implementation of the permanent plan of the Office of Education\n            suggested for the Quitman Consolidated school district, the pupil\n            attendance interim plan of the Office of Education for this district\n            is authorized for use during the remainder of this school term\n            (App. 5). The permanent plan shall be effectuated commencing in\n            September, 1970.    This relief is appropriate in view of the\n            similarity between the proposed attendance plan of the school\n            district and that of the Office of Education.\n423 F.2d at 1268.\n\n                                             8\n\fnondiscriminatory basis and do not increase segregation.7\n\n      The rest of the segregation plan, which dealt with attendance\n\npatterns, was amended by this court so that Lauderdale would be\n\ndivided into four separate attendance zones of West Lauderdale,\n\nClarkdale, Southeast, and Northeast.          United States v. Lauderdale\n\nCounty Sch. Dist., No. E88-0059(L) (5th Cir. 1969) (unpublished).\n\nAll   students    living   in   the   zones    associated    with   the    West\n\nLauderdale, Clarkdale, and Southeast schools would attend the\n\nschools in each of the zones.              The students residing in the\n\nNortheast zone, which contains both the Middleton school and the\n\nNortheast school, would attend the Middleton school if they were in\n\ngrades 1-6 and the Northeast school if they were in grades 7-12.\n\n      In the 1969-70 school year, when the desegregation plans were\n\nformulated, Quitman contained 2,929 students, 1,458 (50%) black and\n\n1,471 (50%) white. The desegregation plan projected that Quitman's\n\nstudent population would total 3,146 students, 1,490 (47%) black\n\nand 1,656 (53%) white.          Enterprise's actual enrollment for the\n\n1970-71 school year was 858 students, 339 (40%) black and 519 (60%)\n\nwhite. Enterprise was projected to contain 768 students, 363 (47%)\n\nblack and 405 (53%) white, in 1969.         Clarkdale's actual enrollment\n\nas of April 15, 1970, was 553 (80%) white and 142 (20%) black,\n\n\n       7\n         \"If the School District grants transfers to students living in the\ndistrict for their attendance at public schools outside the district, or if it\npermits transfers into the district of students who live outside the district,\nit shall do so on a non-discriminatory basis, except that it shall not consent\nto transfers where the cumulative effect will reduce desegregation in either\ndistrict or reinforce the dual school system.\" This provision is named for\nSingleton v. Jackson Mun. Separate Sch. Dist., 419 F.2d 1211 (5th Cir. 1969) (en\nbanc), rev'd in part sub nom. Carter v. West Feliciana Sch. Bd., 396 U.S. 290\n(1970).\n\n                                       9\n\ftotaling 695.        The    HEW   plans    had    projected     that   Clarkdale's\n\npopulation would be 788 students, 203 (26%) black and 585 (74%)\n\nwhite.   Lauderdale's actual student population, as of April 15,\n\n1970, totaled 4,583, of which 1,716 (37%) were black and 2,867\n\n(63%) were white.     The projected student population for Lauderdale\n\nwas 5,078 total, of which 1,926 (38%) were black and 3,150 (62%)\n\nwere white.\n\n     The HEW plans for Enterprise, Lauderdale, and Quitman called\n\nfor immediate desegregation of all schools.                   Like the Lauderdale\n\nplan, the Enterprise and Quitman plans contained a majority-to-\n\nminority transfer provision and a Singleton provision.\n\n\n\n              D.   Clarkdale School:           Post-desegregation.\n\n     After desegregation, the Northeast Clarke County students\n\ncontinued   to     attend   the   Clarkdale       school.       Pursuant   to   the\n\nClarkdale   agreement,      Enterprise         paid   money   to   Lauderdale   for\n\neducating its students.       But two years before the twenty-five-year\n\nagreement expired, Enterprise stopped paying Lauderdale.\n\n     When the agreement expired, Enterprise refused to allow any\n\nmore transfers of its students to Lauderdale.                       The transfers\n\nnonetheless continued to be made under the authority of the Clarke\n\nCounty Board of Education, which overruled Enterprise's denials of\n\nrequests for transfer.\n\n     In the 1991-92 school year, Lauderdale approved the transfer\n\nof 50 students from the old Meehan area, consisting of 36 white\n\nstudents, 13 black, and one other.               Similarly, the Clarke County\n\n\n                                          10\n\fboard    approved    the     transfer   of    309   Northeast   Clarke   County\n\nstudents, 285 white and 24 black, for attendance at the Clarkdale\n\nSchool in the 1991-92 school year.              Enterprise had also accepted\n\ntransfers under an arrangement with Jasper County under which some\n\n83   white   students        were   currently    allowed   to   transfer   into\n\nEnterprise.\n\n      Beginning with the 1991-92 school year, the magistrate judge\n\nforbade any transfers from Jasper County to Enterprise and forbade\n\nthe transfer of Alabama residents to either Jasper County or\n\nEnterprise. Effective January 1, 1992, the Clarke County board was\n\neliminated    under      a    state-wide     reorganization.      In   1991-92,\n\nClarkdale had some 1,052 students on its rolls, 10% black and 90%\n\nwhite.\n\n\n\n                    E.   Stonewall:     Post-Desegregation.\n\n      Beginning with the school year 1968-69, Quitman refused to pay\n\nEnterprise for educating students transferred from Stonewall and\n\nexpressly repudiated the June 11, 1962, agreement in 1977.               In that\n\nschool year, 135 black students from the Stonewall area attended\n\nschools in Enterprise.\n\n      From 1984-85 to 1990-91, an average of 99 black students per\n\nyear have transferred to Enterprise.            The total number of transfer\n\nstudents has grown steadily over the years, with approximately 331\n\nstudents transferring to Enterprise for the 1991-92 school year\n\n(including 31 students who reside in Quitman but attend Enterprise\n\nbecause their parents or legal guardians are Enterprise instructors\n\n\n                                        11\n\for certificated employees).       Quitman had denied each requested\n\ntransfer but was overruled by the Clarke County Board of Education.\n\nOn January 1, 1992, the Clarke County board was eliminated, and\n\nQuitman's denials of the transfers stood.\n\n     In 1991-92, Quitman's student population was 2,609; its black\n\nstudent population increased from 50% in 1969 to 54% in 1991-92.\n\nQuitman now has four schools:     a lower elementary school, an upper\n\nelementary school, a junior high school, and a senior high school.\n\nIn 1991-92, Enterprise educated 819 students, 29% black and 71%\n\nwhite. Of Enterprise's enrollment on September 30, 1991, 47% (396)\n\nresided in Enterprise, 37% (300) resided in Stonewall, and 6%\n\nresided in Meehan in Lauderdale County.\n\n\n\n                  II.    District Court Proceedings.\n\n                          A.   The Litigation.\n\n     Lauderdale filed an action in state court against Enterprise\n\nand the Clarke County board, seeking a judgment against Enterprise\n\nfor failing to pay Lauderdale during the final two years of the\n\nClarkdale agreement and during the years after the agreement\n\nexpired.    Enterprise removed the case to federal court and filed a\n\ncounterclaim, arguing that (1) the Clarkdale agreement had been\n\nmaterially breached by Lauderdale, (2) the Clarkdale agreement was\n\nunconstitutional, and (3) the transfer of Enterprise students to\n\nClarkdale     violated    Lauderdale's   1969    desegregation   plan.\n\nEnterprise also sought an injunction against future transfers of\n\nEnterprise students to Clarkdale.\n\n\n                                   12\n\f      Quitman filed suit in federal court against Enterprise and the\n\nClarke County board, seeking injunctive relief to prohibit the\n\ntransfer of Quitman students to Enterprise.                  Enterprise filed a\n\ncounterclaim alleging (1) that the annexation of Stonewall by\n\nEnterprise was constitutionally void and (2) that Quitman owed\n\nEnterprise for educating the Stonewall students since 1968.\n\n      The parties agreed to have the matters tried by the magistrate\n\njudge, who consolidated the cases on October 26, 1989.                           The\n\nConcerned      Citizens    of    Stonewall,     Clarke      County,     Mississippi\n\n(\"Concerned Citizens\"), earlier had moved to intervene in the\n\nQuitman v. Enterprise case, No. E88-0065(L).                 On October 2, 1989,\n\nthe   magistrate       judge    denied     Concerned     Citizens's     motion    to\n\nintervene but granted it amicus curiae status.                  On December 15,\n\n1989, Concerned Citizens filed a motion for relief from the order\n\ndenying intervention and appealed the denial to this court, which\n\ndismissed the appeal of the denial of motion to intervene.8                      The\n\nmagistrate judge denied Concerned Citizens's motion for relief.9\n\n      Because     of   numerous       inaccuracies   regarding     transfers     and\n\nstudent addresses, the magistrate judge directed all parties to\n\nprepare a statistical compilation of all affected students residing\n\nin the respective school districts and required accurate address\n\ninformation      regarding      all    transfers.      On   July   5,    1991,   the\n\nmagistrate judge issued his first opinion, concluding (1) that the\n\n\n          8\n          February 13, 1990 (Concerned Citizens had failed to file a timely\nappellate brief.).\n      9\n          March 1, 1990.\n\n                                          13\n\fStonewall area was legally annexed to Quitman; (2) that students\n\nresiding in Northeast Clarke County but who attended Clarkdale\n\nshould be considered transfer students under Mississippi law; and\n\n(3) that    Enterprise       should   be   maintained       as    a   viable    school\n\ndistrict.\n\n     On June 1, 1992, the magistrate judge issued a second opinion,\n\nconcluding (1) that 100-125 black students must be allowed to\n\ntransfer from the Stonewall area to Enterprise in order to preserve\n\nthe viability of the Enterprise district, to preserve racial\n\nbalance, and to perpetuate Killingsworth; (2) that Enterprise\n\nshould recover from Quitman for the years 1987-88 and 1988-89 under\n\nMISS. CODE ANN. Â§ 37-19-33, which then required payment of transfer\n\nfunds between districts in the same county; and (3) that Lauderdale\n\nshould recover fees from Enterprise for the 1985-86, 1986-87, 1987-\n\n88, 1988-89 years, but for no other years.\n\n     On July 10, 1992, the magistrate judge issued the final\n\njudgment, which adopted by reference the two previous opinions.\n\nUnder the final judgment, the Stonewall territory was deemed to be\n\npart of Quitman. Beginning with the 1992-93 school year, all white\n\nstudents    residing    in    Stonewall     would    begin       attending     Quitman\n\nschools rather than Enterprise schools.                 Any white student in\n\nStonewall desiring to attend Enterprise would have to submit a\n\ntransfer request       in    accordance     with    state    law.       High    school\n\nsophomores, juniors, and seniors enrolled in Enterprise schools in\n\nthe 1991-92 school year could continue to remain in Enterprise\n\nuntil they graduated.\n\n\n                                       14\n\f      The magistrate judge ordered that, beginning with the 1992-93\n\nschool year, Quitman must transfer between 100 and 125 black\n\nStonewall    area   students    to   Enterprise.10      Quitman      would    pay\n\nEnterprise for the students transferred because of the court\n\njudgment (i.e., all white students from Stonewall attending Quitman\n\nduring the transition years of 1992-93 through 1994-95, and 100 to\n\n125 black students transferred in the years 1992-93 and following\n\nyears).     The magistrate judge ordered Quitman to pay Enterprise\n\n$205,596.91 for Stonewall area students who had attended Enterprise\n\nschools in the years 1987-88 and 1988-89 ($81,022.00 for 1987-88\n\nand $124,574.91 for 1988-89).\n\n      The area of Northeast Clarke County area, as defined in the\n\nClarkdale agreement of February 1962, was deemed to be part of\n\nEnterprise.    Those students residing in Northeast Clarke County,\n\nbut   attending     Clarkdale   School,    were   deemed   to   be    transfer\n\nstudents.    The judgment provided for transfers of certain students\n\nin Northeast Clarke County to the Clarkdale school. Beginning with\n\nthe 1992-93 school year, a maximum of 125 whites would be allowed\n\nto transfer to Clarkdale.       Beginning with the 1992-93 school year,\n\nall white students attending Clarkdale during the 1991-92 school\n\nyear, and all white kindergartners, would attend school in the\n\nEnterprise school, with the exception of 10th, 11th, and 12th\n\ngraders, who could remain at Clarkdale.              Any black student who\n\nattended    Clarkdale   could   continue    to    attend   Clarkdale     if   he\n\n      10\n        Quitman and Enterprise had to allow all requests for transfer by black\nstudents up to 125. At least 100 black students had to be transferred, even if\nfewer than 100 requested a transfer.\n\n                                      15\n\frequested a transfer.         Enterprise would pay Lauderdale $302,562.30\n\nfor educating Enterprise's students during the 1985-86, 1986-87,\n\n1987-88, and 1988-89 years.\n\n       On July 23, 1992, Concerned Citizens made a FED. R. CIV.\n\nP. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment.                   Quitman filed a\n\nnotice of appeal on July 27, 1992; Enterprise filed a notice of\n\nappeal on August 7, 1992, and an amended notice three days later;\n\nLauderdale filed a notice of cross-appeal on August 20, 1992.\n\n       On November 16, 1992, the magistrate judge entered an order on\n\nvarious post-judgment motions, granting a FED. R. CIV. P. 60(b)\n\nmotion by Lauderdale for relief from the final judgment, denying\n\nConcerned Citizens's rule 59(e) motion, granting in part and denied\n\nin part Enterprise's motion for modification of injunction pending\n\nappeal and regarding assignment and transportation of students, and\n\ndenying   a   motion     by    Lauderdale     concerning     enforcement     and/or\n\nclarification     of   the     first   opinion       and   the   final    judgment.\n\nSpecifically, the court ordered that, first, the word \"maximum\"\n\nwould be replaced by the word \"minimum\" in the final judgment\n\nregarding the number of white Northeast Clarke County students to\n\nbe transferred by Enterprise to the Clarkdale school.                     Second, up\n\nto    forty   students    in    Meehan   in    Lauderdale        County    would   be\n\ntransferred to Enterprise.\n\n       Third, Enterprise would be responsible, until further notice,\n\nfor   transporting     those     students     from    Northeast    Clarke    County\n\nattending the Clarkdale School.             Fourth, all siblings of children\n\ntransferred either from Enterprise to Clarkdale or from Stonewall\n\n\n                                         16\n\fto Enterprise under the magistrate judge's authority would also be\n\nallowed to be transferred.       Fifth, all students with parents\n\nworking in the Clarkdale School or the Enterprise schools would be\n\nallowed to transfer to the school where their parents are employed.\n\n     On November 30, 1992, Quitman filed a rule 59(e) motion to\n\nalter or amend the November 16 order.   The magistrate judge has not\n\nyet disposed of Quitman's rule 59(e) motion.    Each party has filed\n\nnotices of appeal of the November 16 order.\n\n     The judgment went into effect at the beginning of the 1992-93\n\nschool year.    Its transfer provisions were phased in during the\n\nschool years 1992-93 and 1993-94 and were to be fully applied in\n\nthe 1994-95 school year.\n\n\n\n                B.   The Parties' Positions on Appeal.\n\n     Lauderdale's position on appeal is that we should affirm the\n\ntransfer of students to Clarkdale and, furthermore, that Enterprise\n\nowes it money for students transferred during the 1989-90 and 1990-\n\n91 academic years, not just during the 1985-89 years.    Enterprise\n\nargues that the magistrate judge erred by ordering transfers from\n\nNortheast Clarke County to the Clarkdale school, that it should not\n\nbe required to pay money to Lauderdale for educating its students,\n\nand further, that it should not be required to bus students to\n\nClarkdale.     Quitman argues that the magistrate judge erred by\n\ntransferring 100 to 125 black students from the Stonewall area to\n\nEnterprise and that it does not owe any money to Enterprise for\n\nprevious transfers.     Quitman agrees with the magistrate judge's\n\n\n                                  17\n\fdecision to allocate the Stonewall area to the Quitman district.\n\n      With respect to the Stonewall area, Enterprise argues that the\n\nmagistrate judge erred in holding that the annexation to Quitman\n\nwas   valid.     In    the    event       that    the    annexation   is     affirmed,\n\nEnterprise contends that the transfer of black students from\n\nStonewall to Enterprise should be affirmed.                  Enterprise would even\n\nwant the transfers increased.                    Concerned Citizens, as amicus,\n\nargues that the Stonewall annexation is invalid and that the\n\nStonewall area should be returned to Enterprise.\n\n\n\n                       III.       Appellate Jurisdiction.\n\n                                    A.    Finality.\n\n      The July 10, 1992, judgment is a final judgment and, as such,\n\nis reviewable on appeal.                 Under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1291, a court of\n\nappeals    has   jurisdiction        over    final,      appealable   orders     of   a\n\ndistrict court.       28 U.S.C. Â§ 1291.            In order for a judgment to be\n\nfinal, it must dispose of all claims of the parties:\n\n      In the absence of [a Rule 54(b) action], any order or\n      other form of decision, however designated, which\n      adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and\n      liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not\n      terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties,\n      and the order or other form of decision is subject to\n      revision at any time before the entry of judgment\n      adjudicating all the claims and the rights and\n      liabilities of all the parties.\n\nFED. R. CIV. P. 54(b).\n\n      An   examination       of    the    July    10    judgment   reveals    that    it\n\ndisposed of all claims of all parties.                       Regarding Quitman v.\n\nEnterprise, the magistrate judge adjudicated the validity of the\n\n\n                                            18\n\fStonewall annexation, ordered a transfer of 100-125 black students\n\nfrom Stonewall to Enterprise, and resolved all monetary issues\n\nbetween     Quitman     and    Enterprise.     Regarding      Lauderdale   v.\n\nEnterprise, the magistrate judge ordered that Northeast Clarke\n\nCounty was part of Enterprise, directed the transfer of students\n\nfrom Northeast Clarke County to Lauderdale, required that those\n\nstudents would be considered transfer students, and resolved all\n\nmonetary issues between Lauderdale and Quitman.\n\n       Although   the    magistrate   judge   granted   two    post-judgment\n\nmotions on November 16, 1992,11 the original July 10 judgment\n\ncovered all the subject matter of the parties' claims.            Therefore,\n\nthe July 10 judgment was final and appealable.\n\n       For purposes of finality, we need not consider whether the two\n\ncases, Lauderdale v. Enterprise, No. E88-0059(L), and Quitman v.\n\nEnterprise, No. E88-0065(L), are one suit or two.               The July 10\n\njudgment disposes of all issues in both of the cases.           The judgment\n\ntherefore is final, whether the suits are treated as one case or\n\ntwo.\n\n\n\n                          B.    Notices of Appeal.\n\n       In determining whether the notices of appeal were proper, we\n\napply the recent amendments to the Federal Rules of Appellate\n\nProcedure.     Although this appeal was filed before the effective\n\ndate of the amendments, courts should apply the amendments \"to the\n\n       11\n         The two post-judgment motions were Lauderdale's rule 60(b) motion for\nrelief from the final judgment and Enterprise's motion for modification of\ninjunction pending appeal.\n\n                                      19\n\fmaximum extent possible\" if such application would not                 \"not work\n\ninjustice.\"      Burt v. Ware, 14 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir. 1994).12\n\n     If the two cases are considered as one, then the operative\n\nnotices of appeal are as follows:           Quitman's July 27, 1992, notice\n\nof appeal of Quitman v. Enterprise, Enterprise's August 7, 1992,\n\nnotice of appeal of both cases, and Lauderdale's August 20, 1992,\n\nnotice of appeal of Lauderdale v. Enterprise.                  Quitman's and\n\nEnterprise's notices were filed within thirty days of the July 10,\n\n1992, judgment.        Lauderdale's notice of cross-appeal was filed\n\nthirteen days after Enterprise's notice of appeal.                 Therefore,\n\nLauderdale's notice of appeal was valid under FED. R. APP. P.\n\n4(a)(3), which provides that\n\n     [i]f one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other\n     party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after\n     the date when the first notice of appeal was filed, or\n     within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a),\n     whichever period last expires.\n\n     If the two cases are considered separately for notice of\n\nappeal purposes, the notices were proper in both cases.                       In\n\nLauderdale v. Enterprise, the parties filed their notices of appeal\n\nas follows:       Enterprise on August 7, 1992, and Lauderdale on\n\nAugust 20, 1992.      Enterprise's notice was filed within thirty days\n\nof July 10.        Lauderdale timely filed its notice of appeal on\n\nAugust 20, within fourteen days of Enterprise's.\n\n     Notices of appeal were also proper in Quitman v. Enterprise.\n\nThe parties filed their notices of appeal as follows:              Quitman on\n\nJuly 27, 1992, and Enterprise on August 7, 1992.             Both notices of\n\n     12\n          The effective date of the amendments was December 1, 1993.\n\n                                       20\n\fappeal were timely filed within thirty days of July 10.                   Thus,\n\nwhether the two cases are considered together or separately, the\n\nnotices of appeal are timely.\n\n\n\n             C.   Concerned Citizens's Rule 59(e) Motion.\n\n      Concerned Citizens is not a party to the case, having been\n\ndenied intervenor status on two occasions.           Enterprise and Quitman\n\nargue, therefore, that Concerned Citizens's rule 59(e) motion is\n\ninvalid and does not affect the validity of the notices of appeal.\n\n      FED. R. APP. P. 4(a)(4) provides that the time for appeal,\n\nusually thirty days, runs from the entry of an order disposing of\n\ncertain motions, including a motion to alter or amend judgment\n\nunder rule 59.     Because rule 4(a)(4) applies only if a \"party makes\n\na timely motion of a type specified immediately below\" (emphasis\n\nadded), it would seem that a motion by a non-party would not defer\n\nthe thirty-day window.13       We need not determine whether Concerned\n\nCitizens's    motion    was   valid,    however,    as   under    the   amended\n\nappellate rules the validity of Concerned Citizens's motion does\n\nnot affect the notices of appeal.\n\n      If a party makes a rule 59(e) motion, the thirty-day period\n\nstarts on the day the district court disposes of the motion.                 See\n\nFED. R. APP. P. 4(a)(4).      Any notice of appeal filed after the final\n\n\n      13\n         But see Thurman v. FDIC, 889 F.2d 1441, 1448 (5th Cir. 1989) (holding\nthat a motion for new trial filed by a person who was later determined to have\nbeen improperly denied intervenor status was sufficient to trigger the provisions\nof rule 4(a)(4)); Boggs v. Dravo Corp., 532 F.2d 897, 900 (3d Cir. 1976) (the\nword \"party\" in FED. R. APP. P. 4(a)(4) \"was never intended to operate as a\nrestrictive rule limiting those who could bring a motion which would have the\neffect of terminating the time for appeal.\").\n\n                                       21\n\fjudgment, but before the disposition of the rule 59(e) motion,\n\nautomatically becomes effective when the district court disposes of\n\nthe rule 59(e) motion.          Id.     (\"A notice of appeal filed after\n\nannouncement or entry of the judgment but before entry of any of\n\nthe above motions is ineffective to appeal from the judgment or\n\norder, or part thereof, specified in the notice of appeal, until\n\nthe date of the entry of the order disposing of the last such\n\nmotion outstanding.\").\n\n     Therefore, even if the rule 59(e) motion were valid, the\n\nthirty-day period would have commenced on November 16, 1992, the\n\nday the district court disposed of the rule 59(e) motion.                       The\n\nthree notices of appeal were effective on November 16, 1992.\n\n\n\n                     D.   The Post-judgment Order.\n\n     The   magistrate     judge       entered    a    post-judgment     order    on\n\nNovember   16,   1992.     On    November       30,   1992,   Quitman    filed    a\n\nrule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the order.                 Soon afterward,\n\neach party filed a notice of appeal of the post-judgment order.14\n\nAs the magistrate judge has not yet disposed of Quitman's rule\n\n59(e) motion, these notices of appeal are ineffective.                FED. R. APP.\n\nP. 4(a)(4).   Thus, we are unable to review the magistrate judge's\n\npost-judgment order of November 16, 1992.\n\n     Our answer would not be different if the rule 59(e) motion by\n\nConcerned Citizens were a valid rule 59(e) motion for purposes of\n\n\n      14\n         Enterprise filed a notice of appeal on December 1, 1992, Quitman on\nDecember 16, and Lauderdale on December 18.\n\n                                        22\n\frule    4(a)(4)(C).           Such    a    motion       would    have    deferred     the\n\neffectiveness         of   the    notices     of    appeal      until     the   motion's\n\ndisposition on November 16, 1992. On that date, the final judgment\n\nwould be immediately reviewable on appeal.                      Because of Quitman's\n\nrule 59(e) motion of November 30, 1992, we would still be unable to\n\nreview the post-judgment order.\n\n       One might argue that Quitman's rule 59(e) motion, ostensibly\n\nfiled in the Quitman v. Enterprise case, defers the notices of\n\nappeal only in that case and this court still would have appellate\n\njurisdiction      over       that    portion       of    the    post-judgment       order\n\npertaining       to    the    other       consolidated         suit,    Lauderdale     v.\n\nEnterprise.       We reject such a contention.                   The two cases were\n\nconsolidated for the purposes of trial and final judgment.                          Suits\n\nthat are consolidated in district court for trial and disposed of\n\nby one final judgment are considered the same case for the purposes\n\nof notices of appeal.            Barnett v. Petro-Tex Chem. Corp., 893 F.2d\n\n800, 805 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1025 (1990).\n\n       Therefore, we cannot review the contents of the post-judgment\n\norder, whether those contents relate to Lauderdale v. Enterprise,\n\nQuitman v. Enterprise, or both. Specifically, we cannot review the\n\nreplacement of the word \"maximum\" with the word \"minimum,\" the\n\ntransfer    of    forty      students       from    Meehan      to     Enterprise,    the\n\nallocation to Enterprise of the responsibility for busing students\n\nfrom Northeast Clarke County to the Clarkdale school, the transfer\n\nof siblings, or the transfer of children with parents employed by\n\nthe Clarkdale school or the Enterprise school.\n\n\n                                            23\n\f                          IV.    Clarkdale Transfers.\n\n      The magistrate judge ordered the transfer of a maximum of 125\n\nwhite students, and all black students requesting transfers, living\n\nin   Northeast      Clarke   County,      to   attend    Lauderdale's    Clarkdale\n\nschool.      The magistrate judge reasoned that, first, the students\n\nwere closer to Clarkdale and, second, the 1969 desegregation plans\n\nfor Lauderdale and Enterprise assumed that the transfers would\n\ncontinue.15     Enterprise argues that the magistrate judge's transfer\n\nof students to Clarkdale should be reversed because (1) Enterprise\n\nwas not a party to the Lauderdale litigation, (2) the transfers\n\nviolated      the   Lauderdale    desegregation         plan,   (3)   there   is   no\n\nevidence of a constitutional violation by Enterprise, and (4) the\n\n\n\n\n      15\n           The magistrate judge stated:\n\n      Although we have decided that the Northeast Clarke County students\n      attending Clarkdale are transfer students, this will not prohibit\n      transfers to Clarkdale. Initially, it would make little sense from\n      an academic standpoint to require all Northeast Clarke County\n      students to travel multiple distances to attend Enterprise School\n      when a school constructed for their benefit is located several miles\n      away.    Further, this Court finds that the transfer issue was\n      properly before the Court in USA v. Lauderdale County School\n      District, Cause No. 1367.     During the litigation of Lauderdale\n      County School District, students residing in Northeast Clarke County\n      were attending Clarkdale. Interrogatories submitted by Lauderdale\n      showed the total number of students residing in Northeast Clarke\n      County and attending Clarkdale.          During the Killingsworth\n      litigation, Enterprise represented to the Court and submitted a map\n      showing the Northeast Clarke County students attending Clarkdale.\n      Moreover, Enterprise stipulated that its school district is divided\n      into two (2) attendance areas )) Enterprise and Clarkdale. Lastly,\n      as part of an objection to its HEW desegregation plan, Enterprise\n      submitted statistical compilations showing Northeast Clarke County\n      students attending Clarkdale. In short, the Court finds sufficient\n      evidence to conclude that both the district court and the Fifth\n      Circuit Court of Appeals were aware that Northeast Clarke County\n      students were attending Clarkdale when desegregation plans were\n      approved for Enterprise and Lauderdale and the Court envisioned such\n      transfers would continue.\n\n                                          24\n\ftransfers threaten Enterprise's viability as a district.16             Because\n\nthere has been no finding of a interdistrict segregative act with\n\na substantial, direct, and current segregative effect, and because\n\nthe 1969 court orders do not compel student transfers, we reverse\n\nthe magistrate judge's transfers.\n\n      In 1962, Lauderdale and Enterprise agreed that white students\n\nfrom the northeastern Clarke County area in Enterprise would attend\n\nClarkdale and that approximately 100 students in the Meehan area in\n\nLauderdale would attend the Enterprise school.            When the agreement\n\nexpired, Enterprise refused to allow any more transfers of its\n\nstudents to Lauderdale.          Enterprise's denials of requests for\n\ntransfer were overruled by the Clarke County Board of Education\n\nuntil the board was eliminated in 1991.\n\n      The magistrate judge ordered interdistrict transfers, even\n\nthough neither party had requested it to do so.17           Lauderdale asked\n\nonly for monetary damages in its state court action. Enterprise in\n\nits counterclaim requested only that the 1962 Clarkdale agreement\n\nbe declared void and that Lauderdale and the Clarke County board be\n\nenjoined from ordering the transfer of students to Clarkdale.               But\n\nthe fact that neither party requested interdistrict transfers does\n\nnot by itself preclude the district court from ordering such\n\n\n\n      16\n         Apparently, neither party challenges the Meehan transfers, which, as we\nhave pointed out earlier, are not reviewable by this court.\n      17\n        See Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 745 (1974) (\"With no showing of\nsignificant violation by the 53 outlying school districts and no evidence of any\ninterdistrict violation or effect, the court went beyond the original theory of\nthe case as framed by the pleadings and mandated a metropolitan area remedy.\")\n(emphasis added).\n\n                                      25\n\ftransfers.    The district court retains jurisdiction to desegregate\n\nthe schools of Lauderdale and Enterprise.18 The district court also\n\nhas the power to enforce the HEW plan for Lauderdale as well as\n\nthis court's amendments to the plan.\n\n      There is no question that federal courts can stop segregation-\n\npromoting transfers of students between school districts, place\n\nrestrictions upon the transfers such as the Singleton provision\n\ncontained in many of the HEW plans, and remedy violations of\n\nSingleton clauses.     It is a different question, however, whether a\n\ncourt can order the interdistrict transfer of students.                    For\n\nexample, if a school district violates the Singleton provision, the\n\nappropriate remedy is to end the illegal transfers, not to order\n\nbroad interdistrict relief:\n\n      A finding that a school district has accepted transfer\n      students in violation of a Singleton clause customarily\n      supports injunctive relief forcing an end to such\n      transfers and compliance with the terms of the\n      desegregation order.    A finding that a district has\n      violated a Singleton transfer provision included in its\n      desegregation order does not, in and of itself, support\n      a broader, interdistrict remedial order unless the\n      conduct which violated the Singleton clause also\n      comprised an interdistrict constitutional violation when\n      evaluated under Milliken.\n\nLee v. Lee County Bd. of Educ., 639 F.2d 1243, 1261 (5th Cir. Mar.\n\n1981).\n\n      We evaluate the propriety of court-ordered transfers between\n\ndistricts under the standard enunciated in Milliken v. Bradley, 418\n\n\n      18\n         See Davis v. E. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., 721 F.2d 1425, 1434 (5th\nCir. 1983) (\"Until [a] unitary system has been achieved, a district court\noverseeing the desegregation effort must retain jurisdiction to insure that the\npresent effects of past segregation are completely removed.\" (citing Green v.\nCounty Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430, 439 (1968))).\n\n                                      26\n\fU.S. 717 (1974),19 in which the Court considered the district\n\ncourt's     plan   to   integrate     the    city   of     Detroit   district,    a\n\npredominantly black district, with the predominantly white school\n\ndistricts in the surrounding suburbs.                The Court reversed the\n\nsegregation plan. Although de jure segregation existed in Detroit,\n\nthe district court had made no finding that the suburban school\n\ndistricts had violated the constitution or that such a violation\n\nhad an interdistrict effect:\n\n      Before the boundaries of separate and autonomous school\n      districts may be set aside by consolidating the separate\n      units for remedial purposes or by imposing a cross-\n      district remedy, it must first be shown that there has\n      been a constitutional violation within one district that\n      produces a significant segregative effect in another\n      district. Specifically, it must be shown that racially\n      discriminatory acts of the state or local school\n      districts, or of a single school district have been a\n      substantial cause of interdistrict segregation. Thus an\n      interdistrict remedy might be in order where the racially\n      discriminatory acts of one or more school districts\n      caused racial segregation in an adjacent district, or\n      where district lines have been deliberately drawn on the\n      basis of race. In such circumstances an interdistrict\n      remedy   would   be   appropriate    to   eliminate   the\n      interdistrict segregation directly caused by the\n      constitutional violation.       Conversely, without an\n      interdistrict violation and interdistrict effect, there\n      is no constitutional wrong calling for an interdistrict\n      remedy.\n\nId. at 744-45.\n\n      This    court     has   noted   that     Milliken      requires   that     an\n\ninterdistrict       remedy     be     imposed       only     upon     \"proof     of\n\nunconstitutional governmental action that has been a substantial\n\ncause of a significant interdistrict segregative effect.\" Lee, 639\n\n       19\n           The magistrate judge held that under Mississippi law, students in\nNortheast Clarke County attending Clarkdale are considered interdistrict transfer\nstudents. Neither party contests this holding.\n\n                                        27\n\fF.2d at 1256 (internal quotations omitted).          In Lee, a school\n\ndistrict comprising the city of Auburn, Alabama, had been carved\n\nout of the larger school district encompassing Lee County.            The\n\ncounty and city school districts reached an agreement whereby some\n\ncounty students would be transferred to city schools.         Because a\n\ndual school system existed in both districts, the black students\n\nwere transferred from their all-black county schools to all-black\n\ncity schools.    Likewise, the white students were transferred from\n\nall white schools in the county to all-white schools in the city.\n\nWe held that these past interdistrict transfers did not justify\n\ncontinuing interdistrict remedies:\n\n     [T]he fact that an interdistrict transfer program was\n     formerly used in order to maintain racial segregation in\n     districts operating dual school systems does not support\n     an interdistrict remedial order unless it is established\n     that these transfer programs have a substantial, direct\n     and current segregative effect. In the absence of such\n     a showing of current segregative effect, . . . no\n     interdistrict remedy is appropriately ordered upon the\n     basis of earlier interdistrict transfer programs.\n\nId. at 1260.\n\n     In the past, Enterprise transferred only its white students to\n\nClarkdale.     With the adoption of the HEW plan in 1969, transfers\n\ncould occur only if done on a nondiscriminatory basis and if they\n\ndid not reduce desegregation. There is no record evidence that the\n\npre-desegregation    transfers   have   a   \"substantial,   direct,   and\n\ncurrent segregative effect.\"\n\n     Neither the Enterprise desegregation plan nor the Lauderdale\n\ndesegregation plan, as amended, requires that students continue to\n\nbe transferred from Enterprise to Lauderdale.        The plans make no\n\n\n                                  28\n\fmention of any transfers from Enterprise to Clarkdale.              From this\n\nsilence, Lauderdale urges us to infer that the plans intended the\n\ntransfers to continue, even after the Clarkdale contract had\n\nexpired.     We infer the opposite.         The courts and the HEW in 1969\n\nknew that the contract would expire at the end of school year\n\n1986-87, and yet they made no provision to mandate the transfers.\n\nWe conclude that the 1969 desegregation plans do not mandate the\n\ncontinued transfer of students from Northeast Clarke County to the\n\nClarkdale school.\n\n     Enterprise makes a number of other arguments that we need not\n\nconsider.      It   contends    that   the    continued   viability   of   the\n\nEnterprise school district is essential to the desegregation plan,\n\nthat the magistrate judge's transfer of students from Enterprise to\n\nClarkdale violates the desegregation plan, that the transfers are\n\nvoid because they significantly contribute to the segregation of\n\nthe Clarkdale school, and that Enterprise should not be affected by\n\nLauderdale's desegregation order.\n\n     Because there is no proof that the pre-desegregation transfers\n\nof students from Northeast Clarke County to Clarkdale had any\n\nsubstantial, direct, and current segregative effect, we reverse the\n\nmagistrate    judge's   order   transferring      students   from   Northeast\n\nClarke County to Clarkdale.       We do not, of course, bar Lauderdale\n\nand Enterprise from agreeing to future transfers as provided by\n\nMississippi education law.        Such transfers, though, must comport\n\nwith the Singleton provisions of the desegregation plans.\n\n\n\n\n                                       29\n\f                  V.    Payments for Clarkdale Transfers.\n\n     Lauderdale and Enterprise honored the Clarkdale agreement for\n\ntwenty-three years of its twenty-five-year term.                  One notable\n\nchange during that period was that, beginning with the January 1970\n\nsemester, all students, not just white students, residing within\n\nthe Northeast Clarke County area of Enterprise were transferred for\n\nattendance at the Clarkdale school, and all students, not just\n\nwhite students, residing within the Meehan area of Lauderdale\n\ndesiring to attend were transferred to Enterprise.\n\n     Sometime      in   the   1970's,     Lauderdale    refused   to   transfer\n\nstudents in the Meehan area to Enterprise, in violation of the\n\nClarkdale agreement.20        Beginning with the academic year 1985-86,\n\nEnterprise refused to pay Lauderdale for the students transferred\n\nfrom Northeast Clarke County to Clarkdale.21             Lauderdale demanded\n\nattendant funds from Enterprise for a six-year period commencing\n\nwith the 1985-86 school year and continuing through the 1990-91\n\nschool year.22\n\n     In determining how much money was in dispute, the magistrate\n\njudge was aided by the fact that the formula for determining\n\nattendant funds for the first two of the six school years was\n\ncontemplated by the parties in their February 13, 1962, contract.\n\nFurthermore, Lauderdale and Enterprise have stipulated to the\n\ncontract formula, figures, calculations, as well as the accuracy of\n\n     20\n          So stipulated by the parties.\n     21\n          The parties have so stipulated.\n     22\n          Its first demand was made in February 1988.\n\n                                          30\n\fthe compilation for those two years.              They have also stipulated to\n\nthe average daily attendance (\"ADA\") figures for the academic years\n\n1985-86 through 1991-92 as follows:\n\n     ADA of Northeast Clarke County students attending Clarkdale\n\n           1985-86   -   248.32\n           1986-87   -   265.75\n           1987-88   -   263.15\n           1988-89   -   277.92\n           1989-90   -   278.31\n           1990-91   -   266.44\n\n     ADA of Meehan area (Lauderdale) students attending Enterprise\n\n           1985-86   -   39.37\n           1986-87   -   38.85\n           1987-88   -   37.94\n           1988-89   -   38.10\n           1989-90   -   31.19\n           1990-91   -   40.91\n\n     The magistrate judge ordered that Enterprise pay Lauderdale\n\nfor Clarkdale transfer students during the academic years 1985-86\n\nand 1986-87 and during academic years 1987-88 and 1988-89, but not\n\nduring   1989-90     and   1990-91.         The    magistrate   judge   ordered\n\nEnterprise to pay for those interdistrict transfers ordered by the\n\ndistrict court for the years 1991-92 and subsequent years. Finding\n\nno error, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                           A.     1985-86, 1986-87.\n\n     The magistrate judge held that Lauderdale had breached its\n\nduty to pay attendant funds to Enterprise and ordered Lauderdale to\n\npay Enterprise $29,237.54 for the year 1985-86 and $74,355.05 for\n\nthe year 1986-87.     These amounts were readily calculated under the\n\nClarkdale agreement.\n\n\n                                       31\n\f                 1.    No Material Breach by Lauderdale.\n\n      Enterprise      argues   that   Lauderdale    breached     the   Clarkdale\n\nagreement because it failed to transfer all of its Meehan area\n\nstudents to Enterprise as agreed.23 This breach, Enterprise argues,\n\nvoided the agreement and relieved Enterprise of its obligation to\n\npay Lauderdale.\n\n      Under    Mississippi     law,   material     breach   by   either   party\n\nterminates a contract.         A breach is material if (1) a party fails\n\nto perform a substantial part of the contract or one or more of its\n\nessential terms or conditions, (2) the breach substantially defeats\n\nthe contract's purpose, or (3) the breach is such that upon a\n\nreasonable construction of the contract, it is shown that the\n\nparties considered the breach as vital to the existence of the\n\ncontract.     UHS-Qualicare v. Gulf Coast Community Hosp., 525 So. 2d\n\n746, 756 (Miss. 1987).\n\n      Despite Lauderdale's failure to transfer its Meehan students,\n\nEnterprise continued to meet its obligations under the contract\n\nwithout objecting to the method of transportation of the Meehan\n\nstudents for several years. As a result, the magistrate judge held\n\nthat the failure to transport must not have been a breach of an\n\nessential term or condition of the contract, that the failure did\n\nnot substantially defeat the purpose of the contract, and that the\n\n\n      23\n          The pertinent provision of the Clarkdale agreement is article VIII,\nwhich reads, \"The eligible school children of the Lauderdale County School\nDistrict residing in [the Meehan area] shall be and they are hereby assigned and\nlegally transferred by [the Board of Trustees of the Clarke County Consolidated\nSchool District of Lauderdale County, Mississippi, later the Enterprise school\ndistrict] to the Enterprise Attendance Center of the Clarke County Consolidated\nSchool District or its successor for the full term of this agreement.\"\n\n                                       32\n\fparties did not consider the term to be vital to the existence of\n\nthe contract.    We agree.   In addition, article XVI of the Clarkdale\n\nagreement provides that breach of one part of the agreement does\n\nnot justify breach of its other parts.24\n\n\n\n                   2.   Enterprise's Offset Argument.\n\n     Enterprise     argues    that   it   should    recover    damages    for\n\nLauderdale's failure to transfer the Meehan students and that these\n\ndamages should offset any damages awarded to Lauderdale. We reject\n\nEnterprise's argument on procedural grounds.\n\n     In its original answer in state court, Enterprise argued that\n\nLauderdale's breach provided Enterprise with an affirmative defense\n\nto its own contract breach:\n\n                               Third Defense\n\n                                Affirmative\n\n          The plaintiff has failed to perform as required by\n     said contract.    The plaintiff has wholly failed for\n     approximately ten years to perform pursuant to Paragraph\n     III of said agreement. The plaintiff has wholly failed\n     to perform pursuant to Paragraphs VIII and IX of said\n     agreement for at least a twenty year period in that it\n     did not assign, transfer and transport all children in\n     the geographical area eligible under the agreement to the\n     Enterprise School District.\n\n          And now having fully answered said complaint, these\n     defendants respectfully pray that the Complaint for\n     Declaratory Judgment filed herein against them be\n     dismissed at the cost of the plaintiff.\n\nThe next section of Enterprise's answer is labeled \"Counterclaim,\"\n\n\n      24\n          Article XVI provides, \"The breach of any part of this agreement by\neither party thereto shall not alter the binding effect of all other covenants\nand agreements herein contained upon both of said parties.\"\n\n                                     33\n\fthus indicating that Enterprise meant to raise the Meehan breach as\n\nan   affirmative   defense   rather      than    a   counterclaim.      The\n\ncounterclaim section ended with the following requests for relief,\n\nnone of which relates to the Meehan transfers:         that the Clarkdale\n\nagreement be declared null and void, that attempts by the Clarke\n\nCounty board and by Lauderdale to transfer Northeast Clarke County\n\nstudents be declared null and void, that Lauderdale be enjoined\n\nfrom accepting such students, that the Clarke County board be\n\nenjoined from transferring or transporting such students, and that\n\nEnterprise be awarded reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs.\n\n     Ordinarily we would need to consider whether Enterprise's\n\nclaim against Lauderdale for breach of contract is a counterclaim,\n\nand, if so, whether Enterprise's failure to raise the counterclaim\n\nwaives the claim under FED. R. CIV. P. 13(a).        Furthermore, we might\n\nneed to consider whether Enterprise's argument was erroneously pled\n\nas an affirmative defense and whether the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to treat the argument as a counterclaim.\n\nSee FED. R. CIV. P. 8(c).      We need not address these issues,\n\nhowever, as Enterprise raises the argument that it should recover\n\ndamages for the Meehan breach for the first time on appeal, so we\n\ndecline to consider the argument.        See Oliver v. Collins, 914 F.2d\n\n56, 60 (5th Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n                   3.   Void As Unconstitutional.\n\n     Enterprise    alleges   that        the    Clarkdale   agreement    is\n\nunconstitutionally void because it provided that Clarkdale would be\n\n\n                                    34\n\fa \"white attendance center.\"        Before 1970, only white students in\n\nNortheast Clarke County were able to transfer to Clarkdale; black\n\nstudents    continued    to    attend    the   segregated   black   school   in\n\nEnterprise.\n\n     In September 1970, this course of conduct changed. Lauderdale\n\nand Enterprise began to transfer students of both races, presumably\n\nin order to comply with the Singleton provision of the HEW plans\n\nfor each respective school district.\n\n     Under Mississippi state law, the subsequent actions of the\n\nparties may modify the contract to an extent consistent with the\n\nsubsequent course of conduct.           Broome Constr. Co. v. Beaver Lake\n\nRecreational Ctr., 229 So. 2d 545, 547 (Miss. 1969).                We believe\n\nthat the Clarkdale agreement was modified so as to permit the\n\ntransfer     of   blacks.         Therefore,      the   agreement     is     not\n\nunconstitutionally void, and the magistrate judge did not err in\n\nrelying upon the agreement to award Lauderdale recovery for the\n\n1985-86 and 1987-87 academic years.\n\n\n\n                          B.    1987-88, 1988-89.\n\n     The Clarkdale agreement expired at the end of the 1986-87\n\nyear.      Thereafter,   any    rights    of   Lauderdale   to   payment   were\n\ngoverned by Mississippi law.        During the school years 1987-88 and\n\n1988-89, MISS. CODE ANN. Â§ 37-19-27 read:\n\n     Legally transferred students going from one school\n     district to another shall be counted for supportive\n     services by the school district wherein the pupils attend\n     school, including maintenance costs, but shall be counted\n     for transportation allotment purposes in the school\n     district which furnishes or provides the transportation.\n\n                                        35\n\f     When such transfer shall be from school district to\n     another, the superintendent of schools of the school\n     district from which said students are transferred shall,\n     within thirty (30) days after a request in writing to do\n     so by the superintendent of schools of the other school\n     district, issue his warrant in an amount equal to the\n     total number of pupils attending the school from such\n     school district multiplied by the average expenditure\n     pupil in the school district from which the pupils are\n     transferred, on the maintenance fund to pay any sums due\n     hereunder to the said school district wherein the said\n     students are attending.    His failure to do so shall\n     render him liable therefor in the amount thereof on his\n     official bond.\n\n1986 Miss. Laws ch. 492, Â§ 104 (amended 1989).\n\n     The basic purpose of the statute was to require local funds to\n\nfollow transfer students.       To that end, the statute required the\n\ndistrict superintendent of the transferring school district to\n\nrequest in writing that the superintendent of the receiving school\n\ndistrict issue his warrant identifying the funds requested.\n\n     Lauderdale did make such a request in writing for the funds\n\ndue from Enterprise.      Enterprise District Superintendent Michael\n\nTaylor brought the request to the attention of the Enterprise\n\nboard, which unanimously voted not to pay funds to Lauderdale.           As\n\na result, Taylor failed to issue his warrant.\n\n     The magistrate judge held that a forfeiture of Taylor's\n\nofficial   bond   would   be   inequitable   because   his   actions   were\n\ncontrolled by his school board.          The magistrate judge awarded\n\nLauderdale $96,731.95 for the 1987-88 school year and $102,237.76\n\nfor the 1988-89 school year.        Enterprise does not dispute this\n\naward on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                    36\n\f                        C.   1989-90 and 1990-91.\n\n     The magistrate judge refused to award Lauderdale any student\n\nmoney for 1989-90 and 1990-91.25          In 1989, Â§ 37-19-27 was amended\n\nto require school boards approving student transfers to enter into\n\ncontracts for the payment or nonpayment of any portion of their\n\nlocal maintenance funds that they deem fair and equitable. Because\n\nLauderdale and Enterprise did not enter into any such arrangement,\n\nthe magistrate judge held that neither party was obligated to pay\n\ntransfer funds for the years beginning with the year 1989-90.\n\n     Lauderdale     does     not   dispute     the   magistrate     judge's\n\ninterpretation of MISS. CODE. ANN. Â§ 37-19-27 but argues that it\n\nshould recover funds under the theory of quantum meruit.           In order\n\nto recover under quantum meruit, a plaintiff must show (1) that it\n\nrendered services under the reasonable expectation that it would be\n\npaid and (2) that the defendant knew that the services were being\n\nperformed with the expectation that it would pay for the work.\n\nRedd v. L & A Contracting Co., 151 So. 2d 205, 209 (Miss. 1963).\n\n     Lauderdale argues that Enterprise should have known that\n\nLauderdale expected payment because Lauderdale had made written\n\ndemands on Enterprise.       The Mississippi statutory scheme belies\n\nLauderdale's argument.       The Mississippi statutes, beginning in\n\n1989, required school boards to enter into agreements to divide\n\nmoney allocated to transfer students.          MISS. CODE ANN. Â§ 37-19-27.\n\nBecause the Clarke County board failed to enter into an agreement,\n\n\n      25\n         Apparently, no question of attendant funds for the years 1991-92 was\nlitigated.\n\n                                     37\n\fand because the twenty-five-year contract had expired, it had no\n\nreasonable expectation of payment from Lauderdale.\n\n\n\n                 D.    1992-93 and Subsequent Years.\n\n     For 1992-93 and subsequent years, the district court ordered\n\nEnterprise to transfer certain students to Clarkdale and ordered\n\nEnterprise to make payments to Lauderdale for the transfers.\n\nAlthough we reverse the transfers, we affirm that Enterprise should\n\npay for any transfers made under the authority of the magistrate\n\njudge.\n\n\n\n                       VI.    Stonewall Annexation.\n\n     The magistrate judge held that the Stonewall area had been\n\nvalidly annexed by Quitman for two reasons.            First, Enterprise was\n\nequitably   estopped   from    arguing    that   the    Stonewall   area   was\n\nimproperly annexed to Quitman.      Second, Quitman's control over the\n\nStonewall area would comport with Killingsworth.            We agree.\n\n     In 1956, pursuant to 1953 Mississippi Laws, Extraordinary\n\nSession, chapter 12, the schools of Clarke County were reorganized\n\ninto the Enterprise and Quitman districts.             Enterprise (then the\n\nClarke County Consolidated School District) comprised the northern\n\nthird of Clarke County, including the Stonewall area.                Quitman\n\n(then the Quitman Consolidated School District) comprised the\n\nsouthern two-thirds of Clarke County.            The state laws created a\n\ncounty school board with limited authority over both districts.\n\n     After reorganization, Enterprise's two de jure black schools,\n\n\n                                     38\n\fan elementary school and a high school, served black students in\n\nEnterprise and Stonewall.        The two de jure white schools in\n\nEnterprise, an elementary school and a high school, served all the\n\nwhite students in the district, with the exception of the white\n\nstudents living in the Stonewall area, who attended the Stonewall\n\nschool.\n\n     In March 1961, the Enterprise board announced an intention to\n\nconvert the Stonewall school to an elementary school for grades one\n\nthrough six.26      Stonewall students in grades seven through twelve\n\nwould be required to attend the de jure white Enterprise high\n\nschool.     Upon learning of the Enterprise board's intent to convert\n\nthe Stonewall school, parents and community members of Stonewall\n\nfiled a petition requesting the detachment of the Stonewall area\n\nfrom Enterprise and annexation to Quitman.27 The petition contained\n\na total of 639 qualified electors of the Stonewall area.\n\n     The Quitman board unanimously passed a resolution approving\n\nthe annexation of the Stonewall area, which would \"become effective\n\nwhen approved as required by law, on July 1, 1962.\"28       Over the\n\nobjections of some of the citizens of the Stonewall area, the\n\nEnterprise board adopted a long-range plan providing for the\n\nconversion of the Stonewall school.29    The next day, Enterprise met\n\nwith the Clarke County board concerning the long range plan and the\n\n     26\n          March 5, 1962.\n     27\n          March 10, 1962.\n     28\n          March 12, 1962.\n     29\n          March 13, 1962.\n\n                                   39\n\fannexation of the Stonewall area to Quitman.              At this meeting, the\n\nClarke County board tabled Enterprise's long-range plan and adopted\n\na resolution detaching the Stonewall territory from Enterprise and\n\nannexing it to Quitman.\n\n     Enterprise      appealed   the    Clarke   County     board's   annexation\n\ndecision to the Circuit Court of Clarke County.             Griffin v. Clarke\n\nCounty Bd. of Educ., No. 6176 (Miss. Ch. filed Mar. 23, 1962).              The\n\ncitizens     of   the   Stonewall     area   filed   an   injunction    against\n\nEnterprise in the Chancery Court of Clarke County.                     Green v.\n\nCooper, No. 6788 (Miss Ch. filed Mar. 30, 1962).                The complaint\n\nalleged that Enterprise, in seeking to convert the Stonewall\n\nschool, acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and without regard to the\n\ngeneral welfare, health, and morals of the affected students.\n\nMoreover, the complaint alleged that Enterprise did not have the\n\nfacilities to accept the 216 white Stonewall students in grades six\n\nto eleven who would be required to attend the white Enterprise\n\nschool.\n\n     The Clarke County board adopted a resolution disapproving the\n\nconversion of the Stonewall school.             The resolution stated that\n\nEnterprise did not have sufficient existing facilities properly and\n\nadequately to teach students in grades seven through twelve without\n\nthe Stonewall high school.30          The Clarke County board was granted\n\nleave to intervene in the Green v. Cooper, No. 6788 (Miss Ch. filed\n\nMar. 30, 1962), to enjoin Enterprise from converting the Stonewall\n\n\n\n     30\n          April 2, 1962.\n\n                                        40\n\fschool.31       Enterprise filed a petition for writ of certiorari\n\nagainst the Clarke County board, seeking to set aside the board's\n\nresolution disapproving the conversion of the Stonewall school.\n\nWilliams v. Riley, No. 6182 (Miss. Cir. Ct. filed May 1, 1962).\n\n      After these suits were filed, Enterprise and Quitman entered\n\ninto extensive negotiations in an attempt to resolve the problems\n\nsurrounding the Stonewall area.              On May 15, 1962, the Enterprise\n\nand Quitman boards, Clarke County's and Quitman's superintendents,\n\na member of the State Educational Finance Commission, the Executive\n\nSecretary of the State Educational Finance Commission, four members\n\nof the Clarke County board, and two citizens of the Stonewall\n\nterritory met and discussed at length the annexation of Stonewall\n\nand other proposals for the continued education of the students\n\nliving in the Stonewall area.\n\n      Enterprise and Quitman entered into a compromise memorialized\n\nin scattered documents, school board minutes, and an agreement\n\ndated June       11,   1962.32    The   magistrate    judge    found   that    the\n\n\n      31\n           April 13, 1962.\n       32\n          The most important sources of the agreement are a proposal by the\nEnterprise superintendent, a counterproposal by the Quitman superintendent, and\nthe agreement of June 11, 1969, between Enterprise and Quitman. The proposal of\nthe Enterprises superintendent reads:\n      I       The suit of Green vs. Cooper (Injunction) to be dismissed.\n\n      II      Williams vs. Riley (6182) in Circuit Court dismissed (Appeal\n              from order of County Board of Education April 2 disapproving\n              District Board order of March 5).\n      III     Order of April 2 of County Board to be rescinded.\n\n      IV      Order of March 5 of Clarke County District Board to be amended\n              in Section I(b) to read as follows: \"Grades 1 through 8 to be\n              taught at Stonewall\".\n                                                                  (continued...)\n\n                                        41\n\fcompromise      consisted       of   six   major   parts:      (1)    The   Stonewall\n\nterritory would be detached from Enterprise and annexed to Quitman,\n\n(2) all black students residing in the Stonewall area would be\n\ntransferred        to    the   all-black    schools    located       in   Enterprise;\n\n(3) state funds would be paid to the school district where the\n\n\n      32\n           (...continued)\n      V       Griffin vs. Board of Education (6176) Appeal on Bill of\n              Exceptions from transfer of territory dismissed.\n\n      VI      Order of County Board of Education of March 14 to be rescinded\n              (Transfer of Territory).\n\n      VII     Stewart vs. Rathburn dismissed.\n\n      VIII    All high school students now attending Stonewall to be\n              transferred to any attendance center which will accept them\n              and pro rata share of District and state funds and teacher\n              units to follow child. Buses to be run to Enterprise and\n              Quitman, all other transfers will furnish their own\n              transportation.\n      IX      Long Range Plan of March 13th to be amended as follows and\n              approved by district and county boards.\n              1.        Stonewall School to have grades 1-8.\n\n              2.        Construction and renovation immediately with\n                        equal priority of Items 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7, total\n                        cost - $110,000.00.\n              3.

The letter began,\n\"Relative to the proposed annexation of the former Stonewall Consolidated School\nDistrict to the Quitman Consolidated School District.\" The letter noted that the\nQuitman school board had adopted, by motion, the contents of the letter on\nJune 5, 1969.\n\n      The June 11, 1969, agreement provided that all blacks in the Stonewall area\nwould be transferred from Quitman to Enterprise, that state funds for each\nstudent should be paid to the district at which the child attends, that the\nagreement would be effective upon approval by the Board of Education of Clarke\nCounty and the State Education Finance Commission, and that the agreement should\ncontinue for 25 years.\n\n                                           42\n\fstudent attends school, (4) the agreement would be effective upon\n\napproval by the Clarke County board and the State Education Finance\n\nCommission, (5) Griffin v. Clarke County Board of Education,33 Green\n\nv. Cooper,34 and Williams v.

On June 12,\n\n1962,     the     Clarke   County       board    approved   the   June    11,   1962,\n\nagreement.        On June 18, 1962, the Mississippi Educational Finance\n\nCommission approved the annexation of the Stonewall territory and\n\nthe June 11, 1962, agreement.             For ease of discussion, we refer to\n\nthe entire compromise as the \"Stonewall compromise agreement\" and\n\nthe June 11, 1962, agreement related to transfers as the \"June 11,\n\n1962, agreement.\"\n\n     On May 21, 1965, suit was filed in federal district court\n\nagainst Enterprise, Quitman, and the Clarke County board, seeking\n\nto dismantle the dual school system being operated in Clarke\n\nCounty.        Killingsworth v. Enterprise Consolidated Sch. Dist., No.\n\n1302(E).         Quitman and Enterprise, pursuant to the preliminary\n\norders entered in the Killingsworth case, submitted desegregation\n\nplans     that     incorporated     a    grade-by-grade     \"freedom     of   choice\"\n\nconcept.        These plans were tentatively accepted on August 5, 1965,\n\n     33\n          No. 0176 (Miss. Ch. filed Mar. 23, 1962) (the annexation appeal case).\n         34\n              No. 6788 (Miss. Ch. filed Mar. 30, 1962) (the Stonewall injunction\ncase).\n     35\n        No. 6182 (Miss. Cir. Ct. filed May 1, 1962) (Enterprise's petition for\ncertiorari).\n\n                                            43\n\fand revised on September 22, 1966.\n\n     Through discovery, the Killingsworth plaintiffs were made\n\naware of the June 11, 1962, agreement.                        On June 14, 1967, the\n\nplaintiffs filed for supplemental relief, requesting the district\n\ncourt to declare the June 11, 1962, agreement unconstitutional. In\n\nits final order, issued July 19, 1967, the district court in\n\nKillingsworth did not decide the constitutionality of either the\n\nJune 11, 1962, agreement or the annexation of Stonewall by Quitman.\n\n     The Killingsworth court's final order held that the previously\n\napproved \"freedom of choice\" plans failed to meet the standards for\n\ndesegregation.            The   court    specifically             enjoined     Enterprise,\n\nQuitman, and the Clarke County board from discriminating on the\n\nbasis of race or color, ordered Enterprise, Quitman and the Clarke\n\nCounty board to take affirmative \"action to disestablish all school\n\nsegregation    and      to   eliminate        the    effects       of   the    dual   school\n\nsystem,\" allowed all students irrespective of race or color to\n\nexercise their choice of which school to attend in their respective\n\nschool districts, held that overcrowding of the particular school\n\nchosen would be the only reason for denying a student's choice of\n\nwhich   school     to      attend,      and    held        that    there      would   be   no\n\ninterdistrict transfers between Enterprise and Quitman \"except on\n\nterms and by procedures generally applicable regardless of race.\"\n\n     On     July     3,      1969,   this          court     reversed      and    remanded\n\nKillingsworth, requiring desegregation plans to be filed by August\n\n27, 1969.    The court further ordered that if no plan were submitted\n\nby the respective school districts, HEW could file a desegregation\n\n\n                                              44\n\fproposal on August 11, 1969, and the parties could object thereto.\n\nOn August 11, 1969, HEW filed separate desegregation plans for\n\nEnterprise and Quitman.         Enterprise objected to its HEW plan,\n\nfiling a motion to strike and to stay action on the plan.\n\n     The HEW plans for both Enterprise and Quitman called for\n\nimmediate desegregation of all schools, including teachers and\n\nstaff members.      Intradistrict transfers are not allowed under the\n\nplans unless the student seeking the transfer would be a minority\n\nin the transferee school.          The Singleton provisions in the plans\n\npermitted a school board to grant interdistrict transfers only \"on\n\na non-discriminatory basis, except that it shall not consent to\n\ntransfers where the cumulative effect will reduce desegregation in\n\neither   district    or    reinforce    the   dual   school   system.\"    On\n\nNovember 6, 1969, this court ruled that the desegregation plans\n\nfiled by HEW would be implemented immediately.\n\n     For   each   school    year    between   1968-69   and   1990-91,   some\n\nstudents residing in the Stonewall area filed petitions requesting\n\ntransfers from Quitman to Enterprise.           The procedure has been as\n\nfollows:\n\n     (1) Quitman for each school year after 1968-69 has\n     consistently denied such requests for transfer by\n     Stonewall students to attend school in the Enterprise\n     School District.\n\n     (2) Such Stonewall students, upon being denied approval\n     of their transfer requests by Quitman, have appealed to\n     the Clarke County Board of Education to overrule the\n     action of Quitman in denying such requests for transfer;\n     and\n\n     (3) In each and every case after 1968-69 the Clarke\n     County Board of Education has overruled Quitman and\n     approved the requests for transfers.\n\n                                       45\n\fThe   Mississippi      legislature          phased       out   county-wide      boards   of\n\neducation effective January 1, 1992.                       Consequently, the appeal\n\nprocess by which some Stonewall students attended Enterprise was\n\neliminated.\n\n      The   magistrate       judge     held       that    Enterprise      was    equitably\n\nestopped from arguing that Stonewall was not annexed to Quitman and\n\nthat the annexation was resolved in Killingsworth.                              Enterprise\n\nargues that the entire 1962 Stonewall agreement is void because it\n\nis unconstitutional.          Enterprise contends that the annexation of\n\nStonewall by Quitman cannot be legally separated from the transfer\n\nof all black Stonewall children to Enterprise and that both actions\n\nshould be voided.         We agree.           The annexation should be viewed\n\nseparately    from     the    rest     of    the     agreement.          By   itself,    the\n\nannexation is constitutional.\n\n\n\n                             A.   Equitable Estoppel.\n\n      Equitable estoppel requires three elements:                        \"(1) Belief and\n\nreliance on some representation; (2) Change of position as a result\n\nthereof; (3)        Detriment     or   prejudice          caused    by    the   change    of\n\nposition.\"     Suggs v. Town of Caledonia, 470 So. 2d 1055, 1057\n\n(Miss. 1985) (citing Covington County v. Page, 456 So. 2d 739\n\n(Miss. 1984)).        The magistrate judge held that Quitman made a\n\nrepresentation that the Stonewall territory was lawfully a part of\n\nQuitman,     that     Quitman     had       sufficiently           relied     upon   these\n\nrepresentations, and that Quitman suffered detriment as a result of\n\nEnterprise's representations.\n\n\n                                             46\n\f     Enterprise admitted that Stonewall belonged to Quitman during\n\nthe pendency of Killingsworth. During a December 3, 1969, hearing,\n\nEnterprise submitted as evidence a map showing the Stonewall area\n\nas part of Quitman.   Enterprise's superintendent testified under\n\noath that the Stonewall territory was annexed to Quitman in 1962.\n\nThe transcript of the hearing reads:\n\n\n     Q:    We've indicated on the map introduced into evidence\n           by stipulation known as the Stonewall area, when\n           was that area detached from the Enterprise School\n           District and made a part of the Quitman district?\n\n     A:    I believe this was in 1962.\n\nFurthermore, in its objection to HEW's desegregation plan for\n\nEnterprise, Enterprise admitted that Stonewall was part of Quitman.\n\nEnterprise's objection reads:\n\n\n     The foregoing facts demonstrate beyond doubt that\n     [Enterprise] is dependent for its financial solvency, the\n     quality of its educational program and its very existence\n     upon pupils who reside outside of [Enterprise] but who\n     have elected to attend the schools administered by\n     [Enterprise].\n\n     If and when Stonewall Elementary School is closed, the\n     Enterprise Elementary School must be prepared to\n     accommodate additional students from the Stonewall\n     Attendance Zone of the Quitman Consolidated School\n     District, who will, without doubt, elect to attend school\n     at Enterprise.\n\n(emphasis added).   For over twenty-six years, from June 1962 until\n\nJune 17, 1988, when suit was filed, Enterprise did nothing to\n\nindicate that the Stonewall area had not lawfully been annexed to\n\nQuitman.\n\n     On appeal, Enterprise asserts that a representation may not be\n\nused as a basis for equitable estoppel unless the other party is\n\n                                47\n\fignorant of the true facts.         See Chapman v. Chapman, 473 So. 2d\n\n467, 470 (Miss. 1985).      Although it is true that Quitman was fully\n\naware of the facts surrounding the annexation, Quitman was unaware\n\nthat Enterprise would suddenly challenge the annexation after\n\ndecades of acquiescence. Equitable estoppel applies to parties who\n\ntake inconsistent positions.        See United States v. Dallas County\n\nCommission, 548 F. Supp. 794, 872-75 (S.D. Ala. 1982), aff'd in\n\npart, rev'd in part on other grounds, 739 F.2d 1529 (11th Cir.\n\n1984), and authorities cited therein.\n\n      Enterprise also argues that the doctrine of equitable estoppel\n\ncannot be used to bar the invocation of constitutional rights.             The\n\nadmittedly sparse authority on applicability of equitable estoppel\n\nindicates the opposite. Two district courts have held that parties\n\nwere equitably estopped from arguing constitutional violations. In\n\nWilliams v. City of Dothan, 745 F.2d 1406 (11th Cir. 1984), the\n\ndistrict court applied equitable estoppel, although the court of\n\nappeals reversed on the ground that the elements of equitable\n\nestoppel had not been met.            Id. at 1410.        In Dallas County\n\nCommission, the district court, in an alternative holding, held\n\nthat a party was equitably estopped from arguing a constitutional\n\nright.    548 F. Supp. at 872-75.       The doctrine of laches, which is\n\nsimilar to equitable estoppel,36 may prevent a plaintiff from\n\nenjoining changes effected without preclearance as required by the\n\n\n     36\n        A party asserting laches must show \"(1) a delay in asserting a right or\nclaim; (2) that the delay was not excusable; and (3) that there was undue\nprejudice to the party against whom the claim is asserted.\" Save Our Wetlands,\nInc. (SOWL) v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 549 F.2d 1021, 1026 (5th\nCir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 836 (1977).\n\n                                      48\n\fVoting Rights Act of 1965.37          Lopez v. Hale County, 797 F. Supp.\n\n547, 550-52 (N.D. Tex. 1992) (three-judge court), aff'd mem.,\n\n113 S. Ct. 954 (1993); but see Dotson v. City of Indianola, 514\n\nF. Supp. 397, 400-01 (N.D. Miss. 1981), aff'd mem., 455 U.S. 936\n\n(1982).   Enterprise therefore lacks legal support for its argument\n\nthat equitable estoppel is inapplicable to constitutional claims.\n\n      Enterprise argues that equitable estoppel is inapplicable to\n\na governmental entity that is asserting the constitutional rights\n\nof a large group of people.         We have found no authority to support\n\nsuch a proposition.\n\n      Enterprise    also    claims    that,    in   a   suit   against a state\n\npolitical subdivision, the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies\n\nonly if the plaintiff is a private individual and not another state\n\npolitical subdivision.          Rye, the case cited by Enterprise, holds,\n\nhowever, that the doctrine may apply to suits by private individual\n\nagainst political subdivisions.         It does not foreclose application\n\nin other circumstances: \"The State, its counties, subdivisions and\n\nmunicipalities     may     be    equitably    estopped    under    the   proper\n\ncircumstances.\"     521 So. 2d at 908-09.\n\n      Enterprise argues that Quitman's belief in the validity of the\n\nannexation did not harm Quitman.             We disagree.      Quitman planned,\n\nbudgeted, forecasted, funded, hired teachers and staff members,\n\npaid taxes, and maintained school property since June 11, 1962,\n\n\n\n      37\n         Although there appears to be no bar under constitutional law to the use\nof the doctrine of laches, under Mississippi law \"the State is not responsible\nfor the laches of its officers.\" Bd. of Trustees of Monroe County Bd. of Educ.\nv. Rye, 521 So. 2d 900, 908 (Miss. 1988).\n\n                                       49\n\funder the assumption that the Stonewall territory was properly\n\nannexed.    Although Quitman received tax revenues from property in\n\nthe Stonewall district, Quitman was deprived of state funding for\n\nthose students who transferred to Enterprise.\n\n      Next, Enterprise claims that it affirmatively made demands on\n\nQuitman to pay money to Enterprise.              But this has nothing to do\n\nwith Enterprise's failure to argue that it owned the Stonewall\n\narea, or its representations that it did not own the Stonewall\n\narea. We therefore agree with the magistrate judge that Enterprise\n\nis   equitably   estopped    from   challenging       the   validity   of   the\n\nStonewall annexation.\n\n\n\n                            B.   Killingsworth.\n\n      The   magistrate   judge    held    that    Killingsworth   adjudicated\n\nownership of the Stonewall area.           Enterprise disagrees, arguing\n\nthat the issue of annexation was never directly litigated in\n\nKillingsworth, and therefore it should not be inferred that the\n\nKillingsworth court approved the Stonewall annexation.\n\n      The final desegregation orders in Killingsworth were based\n\nupon interdistrict boundaries that assumed the validity of the\n\nannexation of Stonewall by Quitman.          Although neither the three-\n\njudge district court nor this court in Killingsworth specifically\n\nruled on the validity of the annexation, they did not have cause to\n\ndo so. All parties, including Enterprise, represented to the court\n\nthat the annexation was valid.       Thus, it is not surprising that the\n\nrecord in Killingsworth reveals no debate about the validity of the\n\n\n                                     50\n\fStonewall transfers. We agree with the magistrate judge that it is\n\nfar too late for Enterprise to protest the annexation.\n\n\n\n                              C.   Separability.\n\n     Enterprise argues that the annexation of Stonewall is void\n\nbecause it is tainted by the unconstitutionality of the June 11,\n\n1969,    transfer   agreement.       The    magistrate   judge    treated   the\n\nannexation of Stonewall and the transfer of black students from\n\nStonewall as a part of a larger agreement.                    The magistrate's\n\nfactual finding is not clearly erroneous.                See FED. R. CIV. P.\n\n52(a).    But even assuming that the Stonewall annexation and June\n\n11, 1969, transfer agreement are linked, the annexation is not\n\nvoid.\n\n     The annexation of Stonewall was completed under procedures\n\nprovided by    state   law.        School   districts    in   Mississippi   are\n\npolitical subdivisions, and state law provides procedures for\n\nchanging their boundaries.           In 1962, the statutory annexation\n\nprocedure was contained in MISS. CODE ANN. Â§ 6274-06, which provided:\n\n     If a petition signed by a majority of the qualified\n     electors of specifically described territory of an\n     existing school district shall be filed with the county\n     board of education requesting that said described\n     territory be taken from such existing district and\n     annexed to an adjacent district, the county board of\n     education, after consideration thereof, and with the\n     consent and approval of the board of trustees of the\n     district to which such territory is to be annexed, shall\n     have the power and authority, in its discretion to take\n     such territory from the existing district and annex same\n     to the adjacent district. However, before doing so, the\n     county board of education must find and determine that\n     the taking of the territory from the existing school\n     district will not seriously interfere with or impair the\n     efficiency of such school district, and all orders\n\n                                       51\n\f     adopted under the provisions of this section shall be\n     invalid unless such finding and determination be made.\n\n     A review of the record show that the necessary steps were\n\nfulfilled.     A   petition   was    filed   with   the   Clarke   County\n\nSuperintendent of Education on March 10, 1962; the Quitman board\n\nconsented to the annexation on March 12, 1960; the Clarke County\n\nboard consented to the annexation on March 14, 1960.         It was only\n\nlater that Enterprise sued to challenge the annexation (Griffin v.\n\nClarke County Bd. of Educ.).        We accept as true the magistrate\n\njudge's finding that Enterprise's court challenge was dropped as\n\npart of the Stonewall compromise agreement, an agreement that\n\nincluded that June 11, 1969, contract.       We are unable to tell from\n\nthe record why Enterprise dropped its legal challenge to the\n\nannexation.    Perhaps Enterprise believed that its receipt of\n\ntransfer students and their attendant funds compensated it for\n\ndropping the lawsuit; or, perhaps Enterprise's appeal had no legal\n\nmerit.\n\n     An action by a state or its political subdivisions pursuant to\n\nestablished political procedures is not unconstitutional merely\n\nbecause the support for such an action is garnered through the\n\npromise of an unconstitutional agreement.      Thus, the annexation is\n\nnot void merely because Quitman's agreement to transfer the black\n\nStonewall students may have procured Enterprise's agreement to drop\n\nits lawsuit.\n\n     Enterprise argues that if any part of an unconstitutional\n\nagreement is void, all of its provisions must be voided.            Even\n\nassuming that the political act of annexation can be linked to the\n\n                                    52\n\frest of the compromise agreement, we find Enterprise's argument\n\nunpersuasive.      None of the authorities cited by Enterprise stands\n\nfor the proposition that an entire agreement is void if one of its\n\nparts or provisions is unconstitutional.38\n\n\n\n              D.       Constitutional Validity of Annexation.\n\n      A    boundary      change    is   void    only    if   it   contributes    to\n\nsegregation.39     The Stonewall annexation did not have the effect of\n\nincreasing segregation.           Neither before, nor immediately after the\n\nannexation, did any black student in either of the two school\n\ndistricts    go to the same school with a white student.                        The\n\nStonewall annexation was no more promotive of segregation than was\n\nany   of    the    other      pre-segregation          boundary   changes   among\n\nMississippi's school districts.           As Quitman points out, Stonewall\n\noriginally belonged to the Quitman school district and was later\n\ntransferred       to     Enterprise     under    Mississippi's      1953    school\n\nreorganization.         If all school district boundary changes during\n\nsegregation were constitutionally void, then both the original\n\ntransfer of Stonewall to Enterprise, and its later return to\n\nEnterprise, are void.         Thus, Stonewall would belong to Quitman.\n\n\n      38\n         One case actually seems to show the opposite. In Shelley v. Kraemer,\n334 U.S. 1 (1948), the Court held a state could not enforce a restrictive\ncovenant to prevent a black person from taking possession of a house. It would\nhave been self-defeating to void the original sale of the house containing the\nrestrictive covenant, as that would have broken the chain of title, thus\njeopardizing the black purchaser's right of possession. Because this was the\nvery right vindicated by the Court, we reject the idea that an unconstitutional\nclause in a contract automatically voids the entire contract.\n      39\n         For example, the annexation of a predominantly white territory by a\npredominantly white school district might be void.\n\n                                         53\n\f                    E.   Material Breach by Quitman.\n\n     Enterprise     argues      that   Quitman    materially     breached   the\n\nagreement by failing to pay money to Enterprise for students\n\ntransferred from Quitman to Enterprise.            Enterprise claims that,\n\ntherefore, it is not obligated to honor the part of the agreement\n\ntransferring Stonewall to Quitman. But even though Quitman stopped\n\nhonoring the transfer agreement in 1968, only now does Enterprise\n\nclaim that the annexation is void because of Quitman's \"material\n\nbreach.\"   Just as Enterprise is equitably estopped from arguing\n\nthat the annexation is void as unconstitutional, Enterprise is\n\nequitably estopped from arguing that the annexation is void for\n\nmaterial breach by Quitman.\n\n\n\n           VII.   Transfers from Stonewall to Enterprise.\n\n     The magistrate judge ordered the transfer of 100 to 125 black\n\nstudents from the Stonewall area to Enterprise.             Quitman opposes\n\nthe transfer, arguing that the transfer is not necessitated by\n\nKillingsworth and that there has been no showing of constitutional\n\nviolation. We agree with Quitman and reverse the magistrate judge.\n\n     The   Stonewall     area    is    lawfully   annexed   to    the   Quitman\n\ndistrict. Therefore, the transfer of black students ordered by the\n\nmagistrate judge is an interdistrict transfer properly analyzed\n\nunder Milliken.     There has been no showing of a government action\n\nwith substantial direct, or current segregative, effect.                See Lee,\n\n639 F.2d at 1260.\n\n\n                                        54\n\f       The annexation of Stonewall was not an interdistrict act of\n\nsegregation, nor was the transfer agreement.                    Mississippi schools\n\nwere   completely       segregated         before    the    transfers.           After   the\n\ntransfers, they were still completely segregated. Furthermore, the\n\ntransfer agreement has no current segregative effect, because it is\n\nno longer operable.            Absent a finding of an interdistrict act,\n\nsegregative      intent,       and    a    continuing      segregative      effect,      the\n\nmagistrate      judge    had    no     discretion     to    order    the    transfer      of\n\nstudents from Stonewall to Quitman.\n\n       Killingsworth did not require the interdistrict transfers from\n\nQuitman to Enterprise.               The orders of the three-judge court in\n\nKillingsworth were reversed.                United States v. Hinds County Sch.\n\nBd., 423 F.2d 1264 (5th Cir. 1969), cert. denied., 396 U.S. 1032\n\n(1970).      This   court        did      nothing    more    than    order       immediate\n\nimplementation      of    the    HEW       plans    for    Enterprise      and    Quitman.\n\nAlthough the HEW plans prohibited certain interdistrict transfers,\n\nthey did not affirmatively mandate any transfers.\n\n       Merely    because        the       Killingsworth      court    was        aware   of\n\ninterdistrict transfers does not mean it approved of them.                               See\n\nUnited States v. Hinds County Sch. Bd., 516 F.2d 974, 975 (5th Cir.\n\n1975) (holding that the fact that the 1969 order did not dismantle\n\nschool bus routes designed for a segregated school system does not\n\nmean that the order approved of the bus routes).                     Furthermore, the\n\nKillingsworth courts were aware that the transfer agreement would\n\nend in twenty-five years.                  Thus, if awareness is equated with\n\napproval, Killingsworth actually would require the cessation of\n\n\n                                             55\n\finterdistrict transfers under the June 11, 1962, agreement.\n\n     The magistrate judge believed that the transfers of black\n\nstudents from Stonewall was essential to maintain Enterprise.\n\nSince the Killingsworth desegregation order, Enterprise has had a\n\ntotal student enrollment between 768 and 858.                      The Enterprise\n\nsuperintendent     testified     that        in     order    to     maintain   its\n\naccreditation, the school needs from 900 to 1,110 students.                    The\n\nmagistrate judge crafted his order so that enough students attended\n\nEnterprise for it to remain viable.\n\n     The decision of this court eliminating transfers both to and\n\nfrom the Enterprise will not significantly reduce the Enterprise\n\nschool   system.    Even   so,   we     do    not    think   that     Enterprise's\n\nviability should be a dominant factor in drafting interdistrict\n\ntransfers.   If insufficient students are transferred to Enterprise\n\nby court order, the consequences are not necessarily disastrous.\n\nEnterprise could get more students by transferring more students\n\nfrom other districts, so long as these transfers comport with the\n\ndesegregation orders and Mississippi state law.                   Enterprise could\n\nattempt to annex more territory, subject to the same conditions.\n\nIf these methods fail, the Enterprise district could be dissolved,\n\nprovided that the district court is satisfied that the elimination\n\nof the district would not reduce desegregation.\n\n     In conclusion, the transfer is not necessary to remedy an\n\ninterdistrict violation, to comply with the Killingsworth order, or\n\nto maintain Enterprises's viability.              The magistrate judge abused\n\nhis discretion in ordering the transfer of students from Stonewall\n\n\n                                      56\n\fto Enterprise.\n\n\n\n       VIII.     Funds for Students Transferred from Stonewall.\n\n      Enterprise seeks to recover money from Quitman for Stonewall\n\nstudents transferred from Quitman to Enterprise.                 Because the\n\napplicable Mississippi law has changed over the years, we approach\n\nthis issue chronologically.\n\n\n\n                      A.   1968-69 Through 1986-87.\n\n      The magistrate judge held that Enterprise should recover from\n\nQuitman for the years 1987-88 but not for previous and subsequent\n\nschool years.      Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n      We briefly explain the relevant facts.             Beginning with the\n\nJune 11, 1962, agreement, black Stonewall students were transferred\n\nfrom the Stonewall area to Enterprise.            At the end of the 1967-68\n\nschool year, Quitman refused to pay Enterprise any transfer funds\n\nand denied the requests by Stonewall students to transfer to\n\nEnterprise. The Clarke County board overruled Quitman's denials of\n\nthe transfer requests.\n\n      On April 12, 1973, Enterprise's lawyer sent a letter to the\n\nQuitman superintendent requesting payment of \"certain funds\" the\n\nEnterprise board considered due to Enterprise. On January 9, 1974,\n\nQuitman's superintendent indicated that the Quitman school board\n\nhad   reviewed    Enterprise's     letter   and    had   taken   no   action.40\n\n       40\n          On December 14, 1973, the Enterprise superintendent stated to the\nQuitman superintendent that Enterprise considered the June 11, 1962, contract to\n                                                              (continued...)\n\n                                      57\n\fEnterprise again requested funds on April 10, 1973, September 11,\n\n1973, November 25, 1975, March 8, 1977, June 4, 1987, February 18,\n\n1988, and October 26, 1988.\n\n      Beginning in December 1988, the magistrate judge signed a\n\nseries of orders staying the collection of transfer funds and\n\npreserving all claims to funds.              The entry of these orders did not\n\nrelieve the parties of their obligations and liabilities under the\n\napplicable Mississippi Code provisions.\n\n      No law allows Enterprise to recover during the applicable time\n\nperiod.      Enterprise cannot recover funds under the June 11, 1962,\n\nagreement because, as Enterprise admits in its brief, the agreement\n\nis void as unconstitutional. The magistrate judge held that during\n\n1968-69      to   1986-87,    no    Mississippi      statute    provided      for   the\n\ninterdistrict payment of funds.                 A review of the applicable law\n\nduring this period confirms the magistrate judge's conclusion.\n\n      In     1962,   the     Mississippi     legislature       enacted   a    statute\n\nallowing the transfer of individual students from one school\n\ndistrict to another by the mutual consent of the boards of trustees\n\nof all school districts concerned.               1962 Miss Laws, ch. 357, Â§ 1,\n\ncodified at MISS CODE ANN. Â§ 6248-07 (effective May 10, 1962).                      The\n\nsection      provided      that    certain   state    funding    would       follow   a\n\ntransferred student:\n\n      Legally transferred students going from one school\n      district to another shall be counted for teacher\n\n\n      40\n           (...continued)\nbe valid, except as to the reference to the race of the students. At some time,\nEnterprise had submitted a race-neutral contract to Quitman for approval, but\nQuitman never approved it.\n\n                                           58\n\f      allotment and allotments for other current costs by the\n      school district wherein the pupils attend school; but\n      shall be counted for transportation allotment purposes in\n      the school district which furnishes or provides the\n      transportation.\n\nId.   The statute made no provision for payments between districts.\n\nIn 1972, the legislature transferred part of the 1962 provision to\n\na newly-created Â§ 37-19-33 (later renumbered Â§ 37-19-27), entitled\n\n\"Counting of legally transferred students.\"                 Section 37-19-33\n\ncontained the same language in the 1962 law quoted above, except\n\nthat if there was a transfer from one county to another, the county\n\nat which a child attended school would pay the county of residence\n\na fee equal to the average cost of educating a child in the county\n\nof residence multiplied by the number of students transferred.41\n\nIn 1978, Â§ 37-19-33 was renumbered as Â§ 37-19-27.\n\n      The 1962 statute does not speak to the allocation of payments.\n\nOnly in 1987 was Â§ 37-19-27 amended to provide for payments.\n\nTherefore, the magistrate judge was correct in concluding that no\n\n\n      41\n           Section 37-19-33 provided in full:\n\n      Students going from one school district to another, other than a\n      municipal separate school district shall be counted for teacher\n      allotment and allotments for other current costs by the school\n      district wherein the pupils attend school, including maintenance\n      costs; but shall be counted for transportation allotment purposes in\n      the school district which furnishes or provides the transportation.\n      When such transfer shall be from one county to another, the county\n      superintendent of education of the county from which said students\n      are transferred shall, within thirty days after a request in writing\n      to do so by the county superintendent of education of the other\n      county, issue his warrant in an amount equal to the total number of\n      pupils attending the school from such county multiplied by the\n      average expenditure per pupil in the county form which the pupils\n      are transferred, on the maintenance fund to pay any sums due\n      hereunder to the said school district wherein the said students are\n      attending. His failure to do so renders him liable therefore in the\n      amount thereof on his official bond.\nMISS. CODE ANN. Â§ 37-19-33 (1972). Also in 1972, the legislature enacted Â§ 37-15-\n31.\n\n                                        59\n\fMississippi    law   required      Quitman   to   pay   Enterprise      for   the\n\nStonewall transfer students.\n\n     Enterprise argues that it is entitled to recover funds under\n\na theory of quantum meruit.          Quitman has consistently refused to\n\npay money since 1968, and it repudiated the entire agreement in\n\n1977.      Under   these   circumstances,    Enterprise    did    not    have   a\n\nreasonable expectation of compensation, and therefore it should not\n\nrecover on a theory of quantum meruit.\n\n     The    magistrate     judge   held    that   Enterprise     is   equitably\n\nestopped from asserting claims to funds due for the years 1968-69\n\nto 1986-87. The magistrate judge found that Quitman stopped paying\n\ntransfer funds in 1968, that Enterprise made its first demand for\n\npayment in 1973, that Enterprise made its second demand in 1987,\n\nand that during the intervening fourteen years, Enterprise never\n\ninitiated suit on the debt it alleged to be due from Quitman.\n\n     Enterprise argues that the magistrate judge erred in finding\n\nthat Enterprise made no demands upon Quitman from 1973 to 1987.                 It\n\nappears that the magistrate judge failed to note that Enterprise\n\nmade additional demands on April 10, 1973, for the 1968-69, 1969-\n\n70, and 1971-72 academic years; on September 11, 1973, for the\n\n1972-73 academic year; on November 25, 1975, for the 1973-74 and\n\n1974-75 academic years; and on March 8, 1977, for the 1975-76\n\nacademic year.\n\n     We need not reach the issue of whether the magistrate judge\n\nmade an erroneous factual finding, or whether any such error\n\ndisturbs his conclusion regarding equitable estoppel. We have held\n\n\n                                      60\n\fthat Enterprise cannot prevail on its substantive theories of\n\nrecovery:     contract, state education law, or quantum meruit.\n\nBecause Enterprise's arguments are meritless, it does not matter\n\nwhether Enterprise is equitably estopped from making the arguments.\n\n\n\n               B.    1987-88 and 1988-89 Academic Years.\n\n     The magistrate judge held that Enterprise should recover from\n\nQuitman for the years 1987-88 and 1988-89 under MISS. CODE ANN.\n\nÂ§ 37-19-27, which required the payment of funds for students\n\ntransferred between districts in the same county.            The magistrate\n\njudge found the amounts to be paid were $81.022.00 for 1987-88 and\n\n$124,574.91 for 1988-89.       Quitman challenges the award, arguing\n\nthat the Clarke County board did not consider on an individual\n\nbasis the appeals of Quitman's denials of transfer requests, and\n\nthat therefore the transfers from Stonewall to Enterprise were\n\nillegal.\n\n     In    1987-88   and   1988-89,   Enterprise   refused    requests   for\n\ntransfer by Stonewall students who made a joint appeal for transfer\n\nto the Clarke County Board.      The joint appeal did not contain any\n\nexplanation for the transfers of any individual student.\n\n     The statute governing transfer payments during the 1987-88 and\n\n1988-89 academic years was MISS. CODE ANN. Â§ 37-19-27.         In 1987, the\n\nMississippi legislature expanded the coverage of Â§ 37-13-27 from\n\nintercounty transfers to interdistrict transfers.        1986 Miss. Laws\n\n1986, ch. 492, Â§ 104 (effective July 1, 1987).          Also, Â§ 37-19-27\n\nwas amended to require payments to be made only for \"legally\"\n\n\n                                      61\n\ftransferred\" students.          The transfers from Stonewall to Enterprise\n\nwere interdistrict transfers.            Therefore, Â§ 37-19-27 applies.\n\nUnder Â§ 37-19-27, Enterprise is liable for payments only if the\n\ntransfers were valid.\n\n     To determine whether the Stonewall students were legally\n\ntransferred, we turn to Â§ 37-15-31, which sets out the procedure\n\nfor interdistrict transfers.           Section 37-15-31 provided that if\n\neither the transferring or the receiving school board refuses a\n\nstudent's request for transfer,\n\n     then an appeal may be had to [the] county board of\n     education. The said county board of education to which\n     said appeal is taken shall act thereon not later than the\n     date of its next regular meeting subsequent to the\n     disapproval or failure to act by the school board by the\n     school board of said school district, or not later than\n     the date of its next regular meeting subsequent to the\n     filing of such appeal.\n\nMISS. CODE ANN. 37-15-31.          Section 37-15-31 did not require the\n\ncounty school board to consider of transfers \"on an individual\n\nbasis.\"     We therefore conclude that the actions of the Clarke\n\nCounty    board,    and   the    subsequent   transfer   of   the   Stonewall\n\nstudents, were legal.\n\n     Quitman argues that the Stonewall transfers violated Section\n\n37-15-15.          Section   37-15-15,      which   governs   intradistrict\n\nassignments, requires school boards to assign students within a\n\nparticular district \"on an individual basis.\"            It reads in full:\n\n     In making assignments of children to schools or\n     attendance centers, the school board shall take into\n     consideration the educational needs and welfare of the\n     child involved, the welfare and best interest of all the\n     pupils attending the school or schools involved, the\n     availability of school facilities, sanitary conditions\n     and facilities at the school or schools involved, health\n\n                                       62\n\f     and moral factors at the school or schools, and in the\n     community involved, and all other factors which the\n     school board may consider pertinent, relevant or material\n     in their effect on the welfare and best interest of the\n     school district and the particular school or schools\n     involved. All such assignments shall be on an individual\n     basis as to the particular child involved and, in making\n     such assignment, the school board shall not be limited or\n     circumscribed by the boundaries of any attendance areas\n     which may have been established by such board.\n\nMISS CODE ANN. Â§   37-15-15.       Section 37-15-15 is not applicable to\n\ninterdistrict transfers. See Hinze v. Winston County Bd. of Educ.,\n\n103 So. 2d 353, 356 (Miss. 1958) (holding that the predecessor to\n\nÂ§ 37-15-15 does not apply to interdistrict transfers).\n\n\n\n                     C.    1989-90 Through 1991-92.\n\n     The magistrate judge held that Enterprise should not recover\n\nfor 1989-90 or any subsequent school years because Enterprise and\n\nQuitman did not enter into a contract for the payment of transfer\n\nfunds as required by state law.            In 1989, section 37-19-27 was\n\namended   to   require    boards    approving   transfers   to   enter   into\n\ncontracts \"for the payment or nonpayment of any portion of their\n\nlocal maintenance funds which they deem fair and equitable in\n\nsupport of any transferred students.\"           Absent such a contract, no\n\nsuch payments can be made.         The magistrate judge stated:\n\n     [T]his Court is of the opinion that, after 1989, the\n     applicable Mississippi Code provisions required the\n     parties to memorialize their transfer agreements. This\n     Court further finds that Enterprise and Quitman failed to\n     comply with this code provision, and as a result neither\n     party was obligated to pay transfer funds to the other\n     for the years following 1989.\n\n     Enterprise urges us to reverse the magistrate judge with\n\nrespect to years 1989-90 through 1991-92.               Enterprise's only\n\n                                      63\n\faffirmative theory of relief for these years would be quantum\n\nmeruit.     As   is   discussed    above,   Enterprise     did   not   have   a\n\nreasonable expectation of payment and therefore is not entitled to\n\nrecovery.\n\n      The magistrate judge required Quitman to make reasonable\n\npayments to Enterprise for court-ordered transfers in the school\n\nyears 1992-93, 1993-94, and 1994-95.         Quitman does not appeal this\n\naspect of the district court's decision.\n\n\n\n                             IX.   Conclusion.\n\n      We REVERSE the magistrate judge's order transferring students\n\nfrom northeastern Clarke County to Clarkdale and from Stonewall to\n\nQuitman.    We AFFIRM all other aspects of the judgment.            We REMAND\n\nfor further appropriate proceedings.42\n\n\n\n\n      42\n          In light of the resumption of school in the subject districts in the\nlate summer of 1994, we direct that the mandate shall issue forthwith.

In addition to the two school districts, there was the Clarke County Board of Education, which had limited supervisory authority over the transportation of Enterprise and Quitman students and the authority to hear transfer appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise had a white elementary school, a white high school, a black elementary school, a black high school, and the Stonewall school.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Quitman had two black elementary schools, one black high school, one white high school, one white lower elementary school, and one white upper elementary school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1962, Enterprise announced that it would convert the Stonewall school, an all-white school, from grades 1-12 to grades 1-6.  White parents in Stonewall petitioned to have the Stonewall area detached from Enterprise and annexed to Quitman.  The Quitman district passed a resolution to annex the Stonewall area.  The Clarke County Board of Education tabled the Enterprise school district's plan to convert the Stonewall school from grades 1-12 to 1-6 and adopted a resolution detaching the Stonewall territory from Enterprise and annexing it to Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise and Quitman approved a twenty-five-year agreement providing that all blacks in Stonewall would attend the all-black school in Enterprise and that all state funds would be paid to the district where the student attended school.  This agreement was part of a larger compromise agreement that settled litigation over ownership of Stonewall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>C. Desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1963, the United States brought a desegregation suit against Lauderdale.  United States v. Lauderdale Sch. Dist., No. 1367(E) (S.D.Miss.).  In the same district court in 1965, private plaintiffs filed a desegregation suit against Quitman, Enterprise, and the Clarke County Board of Education.  Killingsworth v. Enterprise Consol. Sch. Dist., No. 1367(E) (S.D.Miss.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1967, the district court in Killingsworth instructed Quitman and Enterprise to file desegregation plans.  The court tentatively accepted the \"freedom of choice\" desegregation plan filed by the school districts but, on July 19, 1967, rejected the \"freedom of choice\" plans and entered a final order that (1) enjoined Enterprise, Quitman, and the Clarke County Board of Education from discriminating on the basis of race or color, (2) held that Enterprise, Quitman and the Clarke County Board shall take affirmative action \"to disestablish all school segregation and to eliminate the effects of the dual system,\" (3) allowed all students, irrespective of race or color, to exercise, every year, the choice of which school in their district to attend, (4) held that overcrowding of the particular school chosen will be the only reason for denying the student's choice of which school to attend, and (5) held that there would be no more interdistrict transfers between Enterprise and Quitman \"except on terms and by procedures generally applicable regardless of race.\"   Although asked to do so by plaintiffs in Killingsworth, the court did not find the contract of June 11, 1962, between Enterprise and Quitman unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court consolidated Killingsworth, Lauderdale, and other pending desegregation cases.  After consolidation, the cases were reported as United States v. Hinds County School Board.   On July 3, 1969, in a consolidated appeal that included Lauderdale and Killingsworth, this court reversed and remanded, directing the district court to request the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (\"HEW\") to collaborate with the school boards to develop desegregation plans.  United States v. Hinds County Sch. Bd., 417 F.2d 852, 856-59 (5th Cir.1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1032, 90 S.Ct. 612, 24 L.Ed.2d 531 (1970).  If an individual school board and HEW agreed to a desegregation plan by August 11, 1969, the district courts were to implement the plan if it met constitutional standards.  Id. at 858.   If no such agreement could be reached, the district courts were to implement the HEW plan if it met constitutional standards.  Id. at 858-59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HEW filed its plans for all three districts on August 11, 1969.  On August 28, 1969, this court extended, at the government's request, the deadline for filing plans from August 11 to December 1.  In effect, this allowed the parties additional time to redraft the plans.  On October 29, 1969, the Supreme Court vacated the extension of the deadline, directing this court to issue desegregation orders immediately.  Alexander v. Holmes County Bd. of Educ., 396 U.S. 19, 20, 90 S.Ct. 29, 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19 (1969) (per curiam).  At its discretion, this court could modify and implement the government plans.  Id.  In response to Alexander, this court ordered that all thirty permanent HEW plans prepared for school districts in the Southern District of Mississippi, including Lauderdale, Enterprise, and Quitman, be implemented immediately.  United States v. Hinds County Sch. Bd., 423 F.2d 1264, 1267-68 (5th Cir.1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1032, 90 S.Ct. 612, 24 L.Ed.2d 531 (1970).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The August 11, 1969, HEW plan for Lauderdale contained the following majority-to-minority transfer provision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Whenever there shall exist schools containing a majority of Negro students, this school district shall permit a student (Negro or white) attending a school in which his race is in the majority to choose to attend another school where space is available, and where his race is in a minority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, transfers between schools can occur if the student seeking transfer is a minority in the transferee school.  The plan also contained a Singleton provision prohibiting the interdistrict transfer of students unless the transfers are done on a nondiscriminatory basis and do not increase segregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rest of the desegregation plan, which dealt with attendance patterns, was amended by this court so that Lauderdale would be divided into four separate attendance zones of West Lauderdale, Clarkdale, Southeast, and Northeast.  United States v. Lauderdale County Sch. Dist., No. E88-0059(L) (5th Cir.1969) (unpublished).  All students living in the zones associated with the West Lauderdale, Clarkdale, and Southeast schools would attend the schools in each of the zones.  The students residing in the Northeast zone, which contains both the Middleton school and the Northeast school, would attend the Middleton school if they were in grades 1-6 and the Northeast school if they were in grades 7-12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1969-70 school year, when the desegregation plans were formulated, Quitman contained 2,929 students, 1,458 (50%) black and 1,471 (50%) white.  The desegregation plan projected that Quitman's student population would total 3,146 students, 1,490 (47%) black and 1,656 (53%) white.  Enterprise's actual enrollment for the 1970-71 school year was 858 students, 339 (40%) black and 519 (60%) white.  Enterprise was projected to contain 768 students, 363 (47%) black and 405 (53%) white, in 1969.  Clarkdale's actual enrollment as of April 15, 1970, was 553 (80%) white and 142 (20%) black, totaling 695.  The HEW plans had projected that Clarkdale's population would be 788 students, 203 (26%) black and 585 (74%) white.  Lauderdale's actual student population, as of April 15, 1970, totaled 4,583, of which 1,716 (37%) were black and 2,867 (63%) were white.  The projected student population for Lauderdale was 5,078 total, of which 1,926 (38%) were black and 3,150 (62%) were white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The HEW plans for Enterprise, Lauderdale, and Quitman called for immediate desegregation of all schools.  Like the Lauderdale plan, the Enterprise and Quitman plans contained a majority-to-minority transfer provision and a Singleton provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>D.

Pursuant to the Clarkdale agreement, Enterprise paid money to Lauderdale for educating its students.  But two years before the twenty-five-year agreement expired, Enterprise stopped paying Lauderdale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the agreement expired, Enterprise refused to allow any more transfers of its students to Lauderdale.  The transfers nonetheless continued to be made under the authority of the Clarke County Board of Education, which overruled Enterprise's denials of requests for transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1991-92 school year, Lauderdale approved the transfer of 50 students from the old Meehan area, consisting of 36 white students, 13 black, and one other.  Similarly, the Clarke County board approved the transfer of 309 Northeast Clarke County students, 285 white and 24 black, for attendance at the Clarkdale School in the 1991-92 school year.  Enterprise had also accepted transfers under an arrangement with Jasper County under which some 83 white students were currently allowed to transfer into Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning with the 1991-92 school year, the magistrate judge forbade the transfer of Alabama residents to Enterprise.  Effective January 1, 1992, the Clarke County board was eliminated under a state-wide reorganization.  In 1991-92, Clarkdale had some 1,052 students on its rolls, 10% black and 90% white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>E.

In that school year, 135 black students from the Stonewall area attended schools in Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1984-85 to 1990-91, an average of 99 black students per year have transferred to Enterprise.  The total number of transfer students has grown steadily over the years, with approximately 331 students transferring to Enterprise for the 1991-92 school year (including 31 students who reside in Quitman but attend Enterprise because their parents or legal guardians are Enterprise instructors or certificated employees).  Quitman had denied each requested transfer but was overruled by the Clarke County Board of Education.  On January 1, 1992, the Clarke County board was eliminated, and Quitman's denials of the transfers stood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991-92, Quitman's student population was 2,609;  its black student population increased from 50% in 1969 to 54% in 1991-92.  Quitman now has four schools:  a lower elementary school, an upper elementary school, a junior high school, and a senior high school.  In 1991-92, Enterprise educated 819 students, 29% black and 71% white.  Of Enterprise's enrollment on September 30, 1991, 47% (396) resided in Enterprise, 37% (300) resided in Stonewall, and 6% resided in Meehan in Lauderdale County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>II.

Enterprise removed the case to federal court and filed a counterclaim, arguing that (1) the Clarkdale agreement had been materially breached by Lauderdale, (2) the Clarkdale agreement was unconstitutional, and (3) the transfer of Enterprise students to Clarkdale violated Lauderdale's 1969 desegregation plan.  Enterprise also sought an injunction against future transfers of Enterprise students to Clarkdale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quitman filed suit in federal court against Enterprise and the Clarke County board, seeking injunctive relief to prohibit the transfer of Quitman students to Enterprise.  Enterprise filed a counterclaim alleging (1) that the annexation of Stonewall by Enterprise was constitutionally void and (2) that Quitman owed Enterprise for educating the Stonewall students since 1968.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agreed to have the matters tried by the magistrate judge, who consolidated the cases on October 26, 1989.  The Concerned Citizens of North Clarke, Clarke County, Mississippi (\"Concerned Citizens\"), earlier had moved to intervene in the Quitman v. Enterprise case, No. E88-0065(L).  On October 2, 1989, the magistrate judge denied Concerned Citizens's motion to intervene but granted it amicus curiae status.  On December 15, 1989, Concerned Citizens filed a motion for relief from the order denying intervention and appealed the denial to this court, which dismissed the appeal of the denial of motion to intervene.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The magistrate judge denied Concerned Citizens's motion for relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of numerous inaccuracies regarding transfers and student addresses, the magistrate judge directed all parties to prepare a statistical compilation of all affected students residing in the respective school districts and required accurate address information regarding all transfers.  On July 5, 1991, the magistrate judge issued his first opinion, concluding (1) that the Stonewall area was legally annexed to Quitman;  (2) that students residing in Northeast Clarke County but who attended Clarkdale should be considered transfer students under Mississippi law;  and (3) that Enterprise should be maintained as a viable school district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1992, the magistrate judge issued a second opinion, concluding (1) that 100-125 black students must be allowed to transfer from the Stonewall area to Enterprise in order to preserve the viability of the Enterprise district, to preserve racial balance, and to perpetuate Killingsworth;  (2) that Enterprise should recover from Quitman for the years 1987-88 and 1988-89 under MISS.CODE ANN. Sec. 37-19-27, which then required payment of transfer funds between districts in the same county;  and (3) that Lauderdale should recover fees from Enterprise for the 1985-86, 1986-87, 1987-88, 1988-89 years, but for no other years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 1992, the magistrate judge issued the final judgment, which adopted by reference the two previous opinions.  Under the final judgment, the Stonewall territory was deemed to be part of Quitman.  Beginning with the 1992-93 school year, all white students residing in Stonewall would begin attending Quitman schools rather than Enterprise schools.  Any white student in Stonewall desiring to attend Enterprise would have to submit a transfer request in accordance with state law.  High school sophomores, juniors, and seniors enrolled in Enterprise schools in the 1991-92 school year could continue to remain in Enterprise until they graduated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge ordered that, beginning with the 1992-93 school year, Quitman must transfer between 100 and 125 black Stonewall area students to Enterprise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Quitman would pay Enterprise for the students transferred because of the court judgment (i.e., all white students from Stonewall attending Enterprise during the transition years of 1992-93 through 1994-95, and 100 to 125 black students transferred in the years 1992-93 and following years).  The magistrate judge ordered Quitman to pay Enterprise $205,596.91 for Stonewall area students who had attended Enterprise schools in the years 1987-88 and 1988-89 ($81,022.00 for 1987-88 and $124,574.91 for 1988-89).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Northeast Clarke County area, as defined in the Clarkdale agreement of February 1962, was deemed to be part of Enterprise.  Those students residing in Northeast Clarke County, but attending Clarkdale School, were deemed to be transfer students.  The judgment provided for transfers of certain students in Northeast Clarke County to the Clarkdale school.  Beginning with the 1992-93 school year, a maximum of 125 whites would be allowed to transfer to Clarkdale.  Beginning with the 1992-93 school year, all white students attending Clarkdale during the 1991-92 school year, and all white kindergartners, would attend school in the Enterprise school, with the exception of 10th, 11th, and 12th graders, who could remain at Clarkdale.  Any black student who attended Clarkdale could continue to attend Clarkdale if he requested a transfer.  Enterprise would pay Lauderdale $302,562.30 for educating Enterprise's students during the 1985-86, 1986-87, 1987-88, and 1988-89 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 23, 1992, Concerned Citizens made a FED.R.CIV.P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment.  Quitman filed a notice of appeal on July 27, 1992;  Enterprise filed a notice of appeal on August 7, 1992, and an amended notice three days later;  Lauderdale filed a notice of cross-appeal on August 20, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 16, 1992, the magistrate judge entered an order on various post-judgment motions, granting a FED.R.CIV.P. 60(b) motion by Lauderdale for relief from the final judgment, denying Concerned Citizens's rule 59(e) motion, denying Enterprise's motion for modification of injunction pending appeal and regarding assignment and transportation of students, and granting in part and denying in part a motion by Lauderdale concerning enforcement and/or clarification of the first opinion and the final judgment.  Specifically, the court ordered that, first, the word \"maximum\" would be replaced by the word \"minimum\" in the final judgment regarding the number of white Northeast Clarke County students to be transferred by Enterprise to the Clarkdale school.  Second, up to forty students in Meehan in Lauderdale County would be transferred to Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Enterprise would be responsible, until further notice, for transporting those students from Northeast Clarke County attending the Clarkdale School.  Fourth, all siblings of children transferred either from Enterprise to Clarkdale or from Stonewall to Enterprise under the magistrate judge's authority would also be allowed to be transferred.  Fifth, all students with parents working in the Clarkdale School or the Enterprise schools would be allowed to transfer to the school where their parents are employed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 30, 1992, Quitman filed a rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the November 16 order.  The magistrate judge has not yet disposed of Quitman's rule 59(e) motion.  Each party has filed notices of appeal of the November 16 order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment went into effect at the beginning of the 1992-93 school year.  Its transfer provisions were phased in during the school years 1992-93 and 1993-94 and were to be fully applied in the 1994-95 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>B.

Enterprise argues that the magistrate judge erred by ordering transfers from Northeast Clarke County to the Clarkdale school, that it should not be required to pay money to Lauderdale for educating its students, and further, that it should not be required to bus students to Clarkdale.  Quitman argues that the magistrate judge erred by transferring 100 to 125 black students from the Stonewall area to Enterprise and that it does not owe any money to Enterprise for previous transfers.  Quitman agrees with the magistrate judge's decision to allocate the Stonewall area to the Quitman district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the Stonewall area, Enterprise argues that the magistrate judge erred in holding that the annexation to Quitman was valid.  In the event that the annexation is affirmed, Enterprise contends that the transfer of black students from Stonewall to Enterprise should be affirmed.  Enterprise would even want the transfers increased.  Concerned Citizens of Stonewall, Clarke County, Mississippi, as amicus, argues that the Stonewall annexation is invalid and that the Stonewall area should be returned to Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>III.

Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291, a court of appeals has jurisdiction over final, appealable orders of a district court.  28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291.

Regarding Quitman v.

Enterprise, Enterprise's August 7, 1992, notice of appeal of both cases, and Lauderdale's August 20, 1992, notice of appeal of Lauderdale v. Enterprise.   Quitman's and Enterprise's notices were filed within thirty days of the July 10, 1992, judgment.  Lauderdale's notice of cross-appeal was filed thirteen days after Enterprise's notice of appeal.  Therefore, Lauderdale's notice of appeal was valid under FED.R.APP.P. 4(a)(3), which provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>[i]f one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice of appeal was filed, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period last expires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the two cases are considered separately for notice of appeal purposes, the notices were proper in both cases.

Both notices of appeal were timely filed within thirty days of July 10.

Enterprise and Quitman argue, therefore, that Concerned Citizens's rule 59(e) motion is invalid and does not affect the validity of the notices of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FED.R.APP.P. 4(a)(4) provides that the time for appeal, usually thirty days, runs from the entry of an order disposing of certain motions, including a motion to alter or amend judgment under rule 59.  Because rule 4(a)(4) applies only if a \"party makes a timely motion of a type specified immediately below\" (emphasis added), it would seem that a motion by a non-party would not defer the thirty-day window.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  We need not determine whether Concerned Citizens's motion was valid, however, as under the amended appellate rules the validity of Concerned Citizens's motion does not affect the notices of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a party makes a rule 59(e) motion, the thirty-day period starts on the day the district court disposes of the motion.  See FED.R.APP.P. 4(a)(4).  Any notice of appeal filed after the final judgment, but before the disposition of the rule 59(e) motion, automatically becomes effective when the district court disposes of the rule 59(e) motion.  Id.

On November 30, 1992, Quitman filed a rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the order.  Soon afterward, each party filed a notice of appeal of the post-judgment order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  As the magistrate judge has not yet disposed of Quitman's rule 59(e) motion, these notices of appeal are ineffective.  FED.R.APP.P. 4(a)(4).  Thus, we are unable to review the magistrate judge's post-judgment order of November 16, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our answer would not be different if the rule 59(e) motion by Concerned Citizens were a valid rule 59(e) motion for purposes of rule 4(a)(4)(C).  Such a motion would have deferred the effectiveness of the notices of appeal until the motion's disposition on November 16, 1992.  On that date, the final judgment would be immediately reviewable on appeal.  Because of Quitman's rule 59(e) motion of November 30, 1992, we would still be unable to review the post-judgment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might argue that Quitman's rule 59(e) motion, ostensibly filed in the Quitman v. Enterprise case, defers the notices of appeal only in that case and this court still would have appellate jurisdiction over that portion of the post-judgment order pertaining to the other consolidated suit, Lauderdale v. Enterprise.   We reject such a contention.  The two cases were consolidated for the purposes of trial and final judgment.  Suits that are consolidated in district court for trial and disposed of by one final judgment are considered the same case for the purposes of notices of appeal.  Barnett v. Petro-Tex Chem.

Enterprise, Quitman v. Enterprise, or both.  Specifically, we cannot review the replacement of the word \"maximum\" with the word \"minimum,\" the transfer of forty students from Meehan to Enterprise, the allocation to Enterprise of the responsibility for busing students from Northeast Clarke County to the Clarkdale school, the transfer of siblings, or the transfer of children with parents employed by the Clarkdale school or the Enterprise school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p>IV. Clarkdale Transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge ordered the transfer of a maximum of 125 white students, and all black students requesting transfers, living in Northeast Clarke County, to attend Lauderdale's Clarkdale school.  The magistrate judge reasoned that, first, the students were closer to Clarkdale and, second, the 1969 desegregation plans for Lauderdale and Enterprise assumed that the transfers would continue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Enterprise argues that the magistrate judge's transfer of students to Clarkdale should be reversed because (1) Enterprise was not a party to the Lauderdale litigation, (2) the transfers violated the Lauderdale desegregation plan, (3) there is no evidence of a constitutional violation by Enterprise, and (4) the transfers threaten Enterprise's viability as a district.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Because there has been no finding of a interdistrict segregative act with a substantial, direct, and current segregative effect, and because the 1969 court orders do not compel student transfers, we reverse the magistrate judge's transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1962, Lauderdale and Enterprise agreed that white students from the northeastern Clarke County area in Enterprise would attend Clarkdale and that approximately 100 students in the Meehan area in Lauderdale would attend the Enterprise school.  When the agreement expired, Enterprise refused to allow any more transfers of its students to Lauderdale.  Enterprise's denials of requests for transfer were overruled by the Clarke County Board of Education until the board was eliminated effective January 1, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge ordered interdistrict transfers, even though neither party had requested it to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Lauderdale asked only for monetary damages in its state court action.  Enterprise in its counterclaim requested only that the 1962 Clarkdale agreement be declared void and that Lauderdale and the Clarke County board be enjoined from ordering the transfer of students to Clarkdale.  But the fact that neither party requested interdistrict transfers does not by itself preclude the district court from ordering such transfers.  The district court retains jurisdiction to desegregate the schools of Lauderdale and Enterprise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  The district court also has the power to enforce the HEW plan for Lauderdale as well as this court's amendments to the plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that federal courts can stop segregation-promoting transfers of students between school districts, place restrictions upon the transfers such as the Singleton provision contained in many of the HEW plans, and remedy violations of Singleton clauses.  It is a different question, however, whether a court can order the interdistrict transfer of students.  For example, if a school district violates the Singleton provision, the appropriate remedy is to end the illegal transfers, not to order broad interdistrict relief:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>A finding that a school district has accepted transfer students in violation of a Singleton clause customarily supports injunctive relief forcing an end to such transfers and compliance with the terms of the desegregation order.  A finding that a district has violated a Singleton transfer provision included in its desegregation order does not, in and of itself, support a broader, interdistrict remedial order unless the conduct which violated the Singleton clause also comprised an interdistrict constitutional violation when evaluated under Milliken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lee v. Lee County Bd. of Educ., 639 F.2d 1243, 1261 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We evaluate the propriety of court-ordered transfers between districts under the standard enunciated in Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> in which the Court considered the district court's plan to integrate the city of Detroit district, a predominantly black district, with the predominantly white school districts in the surrounding suburbs.  The Court reversed the desegregation plan.  Although de jure segregation existed in Detroit, the district court had made no finding that the suburban school districts had violated the constitution or that such a violation had an interdistrict effect:Before the boundaries of separate and autonomous school districts may be set aside by consolidating the separate units for remedial purposes or by imposing a cross-district remedy, it must first be shown that there has been a constitutional violation within one district that produces a significant segregative effect in another district.  Specifically, it must be shown that racially discriminatory acts of the state or local school districts, or of a single school district have been a substantial cause of interdistrict segregation.  Thus an interdistrict remedy might be in order where the racially discriminatory acts of one or more school districts caused racial segregation in an adjacent district, or where district lines have been deliberately drawn on the basis of race.  In such circumstances an interdistrict remedy would be appropriate to eliminate the interdistrict segregation directly caused by the constitutional violation.  Conversely, without an interdistrict violation and interdistrict effect, there is no constitutional wrong calling for an interdistrict remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 744-45, 94 S.Ct. at 3127.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has noted that Milliken requires that an interdistrict remedy be imposed only upon \"proof of unconstitutional governmental action that has been a substantial cause of a significant interdistrict segregative effect.\"  Lee, 639 F.2d at 1256 (internal quotations omitted).  In Lee, a school district comprising the city of Auburn, Alabama, had been carved out of the larger school district encompassing Lee County.  The county and city school districts reached an agreement whereby some county students would be transferred to city schools.  Because a dual school system existed in both districts, the black students were transferred from their all-black county schools to all-black city schools.  Likewise, the white students were transferred from all-white schools in the county to all-white schools in the city.  We held that these past interdistrict transfers did not justify continuing interdistrict remedies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p>[T]he fact that an interdistrict transfer program was formerly used in order to maintain racial segregation in districts operating dual school systems does not support an interdistrict remedial order unless it is established that these transfer programs have a substantial, direct and current segregative effect.  In the absence of such a showing of current segregative effect, ... no interdistrict remedy is appropriately ordered upon the basis of earlier interdistrict transfer programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1260.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the past, Enterprise transferred only its white students to Clarkdale.  With the adoption of the HEW plan in 1969, transfers could occur only if done on a nondiscriminatory basis and if they did not reduce desegregation.  There is no record evidence that the pre-desegregation transfers have a \"substantial, direct, and current segregative effect.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the Enterprise desegregation plan nor the Lauderdale desegregation plan, as amended, requires that students continue to be transferred from Enterprise to Lauderdale.  The plans make no mention of any transfers from Enterprise to Clarkdale.  From this silence, Lauderdale urges us to infer that the plans intended the transfers to continue, even after the Clarkdale contract had expired.  We infer the opposite.  The courts and the HEW in 1969 knew that the contract would expire at the end of school year 1986-87, and yet they made no provision to mandate the transfers.  We conclude that the 1969 desegregation plans do not mandate the continued transfer of students from Northeast Clarke County to the Clarkdale school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise makes a number of other arguments that we need not consider.  It contends that the continued viability of the Enterprise school district is essential to the desegregation plan, that the magistrate judge's transfer of students from Enterprise to Clarkdale violates the desegregation plan, that the transfers are void because they significantly contribute to the segregation of the Clarkdale school, and that Enterprise should not be affected by Lauderdale's desegregation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there is no proof that the pre-desegregation transfers of students from Northeast Clarke County to Clarkdale had any substantial, direct, and current segregative effect, we reverse the magistrate judge's order transferring students from Northeast Clarke County to Clarkdale.  We do not, of course, bar Lauderdale and Enterprise from agreeing to future transfers as provided by Mississippi education law.  Such transfers, though, must comport with the Singleton provisions of the desegregation plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p>V.

One notable change during that period was that, beginning with the January 1970 semester, all students, not just white students, residing within the Northeast Clarke County area of Enterprise were transferred for attendance at the Clarkdale school, and all students, not just white students, residing within the Meehan area of Lauderdale desiring to attend were transferred to Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in the 1970's, Lauderdale refused to transfer students in the Meehan area to Enterprise, in violation of the Clarkdale agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  Beginning with the academic year 1985-86, Enterprise refused to pay Lauderdale for the students transferred from Northeast Clarke County to Clarkdale.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  Lauderdale demanded attendant funds from Enterprise for a six-year period commencing with the 1985-86 school year and continuing through the 1990-91 school year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining how much money was in dispute, the magistrate judge was aided by the fact that the formula for determining attendant funds for the first two of the six school years was contemplated by the parties in their February 13, 1962, contract.

The counterclaim section ended with the following requests for relief, none of which relates to the Meehan transfers:  that the Clarkdale agreement be declared null and void, that attempts by the Clarke County board and by Lauderdale to transfer Northeast Clarke County students be declared null and void, that Lauderdale be enjoined from accepting such students, that the Clarke County board be enjoined from transferring or transporting such students, and that Enterprise be awarded reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily we would need to consider whether Enterprise's claim against Lauderdale for breach of contract is a counterclaim, and, if so, whether Enterprise's failure to raise the counterclaim waives the claim under FED.R.CIV.P. 13(a).  Furthermore, we might need to consider whether Enterprise's argument was erroneously pled as an affirmative defense and whether the district court abused its discretion in refusing to treat the argument as a counterclaim.  See FED. R.CIV.P. 8(c).  We need not address these issues, however, as Enterprise raises the argument that it should recover damages for the Meehan breach for the first time on appeal, so we decline to consider the argument.

Broome Constr.  Co. v. Beaver Lake Recreational Ctr., 229 So.2d 545, 547 (Miss.1969).  We believe that the Clarkdale agreement was modified so as to permit the transfer of blacks.  Therefore, the agreement is not unconstitutionally void, and the magistrate judge did not err in relying upon the agreement to award Lauderdale recovery for the 1985-86 and 1987-87 academic years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p>B. 1987-88, 1988-89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Clarkdale agreement expired at the end of the 1986-87 year.  Thereafter, any rights of Lauderdale to payment were governed by Mississippi law.  During the school years 1987-88 and 1988-89, MISS.CODE ANN.

To that end, the statute required the district superintendent of the transferring school district to request in writing that the superintendent of the receiving school district issue his warrant identifying the funds requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lauderdale did make such a request in writing for the funds due from Enterprise.

The magistrate judge awarded Lauderdale $96,731.95 for the 1987-88 school year and $102,237.76 for the 1988-89 school year.

Because Lauderdale and Enterprise did not enter into any such arrangement, the magistrate judge held that neither party was obligated to pay transfer funds for the years beginning with the year 1989-90.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lauderdale does not dispute the magistrate judge's interpretation of MISS.CODE ANN. Sec. 37-19-27 but argues that it should recover funds under the theory of quantum meruit.  In order to recover under quantum meruit, a plaintiff must show (1) that it rendered services under the reasonable expectation that it would be paid and (2) that the defendant knew that the services were being performed with the expectation that it would pay for the work.

The Mississippi statutory scheme belies Lauderdale's argument.  The Mississippi statutes, beginning in 1989, required school boards to enter into agreements to divide money allocated to transfer students.  MISS.CODE ANN. Sec. 37-19-27.  Because Lauderdale failed to enter into an agreement, and because the twenty-five-year contract had expired, it had no reasonable expectation of payment from Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p>D. 1992-93 and Subsequent Years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For 1992-93 and subsequent years, the district court ordered Enterprise to transfer certain students to Clarkdale and ordered Enterprise to make payments to Lauderdale for the transfers.

First, Enterprise was equitably estopped from arguing that the Stonewall area was improperly annexed to Quitman.  Second, Quitman's control over the Stonewall area would comport with Killingsworth.   We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1957, pursuant to 1953 Mississippi Laws, Extraordinary Session, chapter 12, the schools of Clarke County were reorganized into the Enterprise and Quitman districts.  Enterprise (then the Clarke County Consolidated School District) comprised the northern third of Clarke County, including the Stonewall area.  Quitman (then the Quitman Consolidated School District) comprised the southern two-thirds of Clarke County.

The two de jure white schools in Enterprise, an elementary school and a high school, served all the white students in the district, with the exception of the white students living in the Stonewall area, who attended the Stonewall school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1961, the Enterprise board announced an intention to convert the Stonewall school to an elementary school for grades one through six.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  Stonewall students in grades seven through twelve would be required to attend the de jure white Enterprise high school.

Green v. Cooper, No. 6788 (Miss.  Ch. filed Mar. 30, 1962).  The complaint alleged that Enterprise, in seeking to convert the Stonewall school, acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and without regard to the general welfare, health, and morals of the affected students.

On June 18, 1962, the Mississippi Educational Finance Commission approved the annexation of the Stonewall territory and the June 11, 1962, agreement.

Killingsworth v. Enterprise Consolidated Sch. Dist., No. 1302(E).  Quitman and Enterprise, pursuant to the preliminary orders entered in the Killingsworth case, submitted desegregation plans that incorporated a grade-by-grade \"freedom of choice\" concept.

On June 14, 1967, the plaintiffs filed for supplemental relief, requesting the district court to declare the June 11, 1962, agreement unconstitutional.  In its final order, issued July 19, 1967, the district court in Killingsworth did not decide the constitutionality of either the June 11, 1962, agreement or the annexation of Stonewall by Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Killingsworth court's final order held that the previously approved \"freedom of choice\" plans failed to meet the standards for desegregation.  The court specifically enjoined Enterprise, Quitman, and the Clarke County board from discriminating on the basis of race or color, ordered Enterprise, Quitman and the Clarke County board to take affirmative \"action to disestablish all school segregation and to eliminate the effects of the dual school system,\" allowed all students irrespective of race or color to exercise their choice of which school to attend in their respective school districts, held that overcrowding of the particular school chosen would be the only reason for denying a student's choice of which school to attend, and held that there would be no interdistrict transfers between Enterprise and Quitman \"except on terms and by procedures generally applicable regardless of race.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 3, 1969, this court reversed and remanded Killingsworth, requiring desegregation plans to be implemented by August 27, 1969.  The court further ordered that if no plan were submitted by the respective school districts, HEW could file a desegregation proposal on August 11, 1969, and the parties could object thereto.  On August 11, 1969, HEW filed separate desegregation plans for Enterprise and Quitman.

Intradistrict transfers are not allowed under the plans unless the student seeking the transfer would be a minority in the transferee school.  The Singleton provisions in the plans permitted a school board to grant interdistrict transfers only \"on a non-discriminatory basis, except that it shall not consent to transfers where the cumulative effect will reduce desegregation in either district or reinforce the dual school system.\"   On November 6, 1969, this court ruled that the desegregation plans filed by HEW would be implemented immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For each school year between 1968-69 and 1990-91, some students residing in the Stonewall area filed petitions requesting transfers from Quitman to Enterprise.

Enterprise argues that the entire 1962 Stonewall agreement is void because it is unconstitutional.  Enterprise contends that the annexation of Stonewall by Quitman cannot be legally separated from the transfer of all black Stonewall children to Enterprise and that both actions should be voided.

Town of Caledonia, 470 So.2d 1055, 1057 (Miss.1985) (citing Covington County v. Page, 456 So.2d 739 (Miss.1984)).  The magistrate judge held that Enterprise made a representation that the Stonewall territory was lawfully a part of Quitman, that Quitman had sufficiently relied upon these representations, and that Quitman suffered detriment as a result of Enterprise's representations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise admitted that Stonewall belonged to Quitman during the pendency of Killingsworth.   During a December 3, 1969, hearing, Enterprise submitted as evidence a map showing the Stonewall area as part of Quitman.  Enterprise's superintendent testified under oath that the Stonewall territory was annexed to Quitman in 1962.

See Chapman v. Chapman, 473 So.2d 467, 470 (Miss.1985).  Although it is true that Quitman was fully aware of the facts surrounding the annexation, Quitman was unaware that Enterprise would suddenly challenge the annexation after decades of acquiescence.  Equitable estoppel applies to parties who take inconsistent positions.  See United States v. Dallas County Commission, 548 F.Supp. 794, 872-75 (S.D.Ala.1982), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 739 F.2d 1529 (11th Cir.1984), and authorities cited therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise also argues that the doctrine of equitable estoppel cannot be used to bar the invocation of constitutional rights.  The admittedly sparse authority on applicability of equitable estoppel indicates the opposite.  Two district courts have held that parties were equitably estopped from arguing constitutional violations.  In Williams v. City of Dothan, 745 F.2d 1406 (11th Cir.1984), the district court applied equitable estoppel, although the court of appeals reversed on the ground that the elements of equitable estoppel had not been met.  Id. at 1410.   In Dallas County Commission, the district court, in an alternative holding, held that a party was equitably estopped from arguing a constitutional right.  548 F.Supp. at 872-75.   The doctrine of laches, which is similar to equitable estoppel,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> may prevent a plaintiff from enjoining changes effected without preclearance as required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>  Lopez v. Hale County, 797 F.Supp. 547, 550-52 (N.D.Tex.1992) (three-judge court), aff'd mem., --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 954, 122 L.Ed.2d 112 (1993);  but see Dotson v. City of Indianola, 514 F.Supp. 397, 400-01 (N.D.Miss.1981).  Enterprise therefore lacks legal support for its argument that equitable estoppel is inapplicable to constitutional claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that equitable estoppel is inapplicable to a governmental entity that is asserting the constitutional rights of a large group of people.  We have found no authority to support such a proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise also claims that, in a suit against a state political subdivision, the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies only if the plaintiff is a private individual and not another state political subdivision.  Board of Trustees v. Rye, 521 So.2d 900 (Miss.1988), the case cited by Enterprise, holds, however, that the doctrine may apply to suits by private individual against political subdivisions.  It does not foreclose application in other circumstances:  \"The State, its counties, subdivisions and municipalities may be equitably estopped under the proper circumstances.\"  521 So.2d at 908-09.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that Quitman's belief in the validity of the annexation did not harm Quitman.  We disagree.  Quitman planned, budgeted, forecasted, funded, hired teachers and staff members, paid taxes, and maintained school property since June 11, 1962, under the assumption that the Stonewall territory was properly annexed.  Although Quitman received tax revenues from property in the Stonewall district, Quitman was deprived of state funding for those students who transferred to Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Enterprise claims that it affirmatively made demands on Quitman to pay money to Enterprise.  But this has nothing to do with Enterprise's failure to argue that it owned the Stonewall area, or its representations that it did not own the Stonewall area.  We therefore agree with the magistrate judge that Enterprise is equitably estopped from challenging the validity of the Stonewall annexation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p>B. Killingsworth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge held that Killingsworth adjudicated ownership of the Stonewall area.  Enterprise disagrees, arguing that the issue of annexation was never directly litigated in Killingsworth, and therefore it should not be inferred that the Killingsworth court approved the Stonewall annexation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final desegregation orders in Killingsworth were based upon interdistrict boundaries that assumed the validity of the annexation of Stonewall by Quitman.  Although neither the three-judge district court nor this court in Killingsworth specifically ruled on the validity of the annexation, they did not have cause to do so.  All parties, including Enterprise, represented to the court that the annexation was valid.  Thus, it is not surprising that the record in Killingsworth reveals no debate about the validity of the Stonewall transfers.  We agree with the magistrate judge that it is far too late for Enterprise to protest the annexation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p>C. Separability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that the annexation of Stonewall is void because it is tainted by the unconstitutionality of the June 11, 1962, transfer agreement.  The magistrate judge treated the annexation of Stonewall and the transfer of black students from Stonewall as a part of a larger agreement.  The magistrate's factual finding is not clearly erroneous.  See FED.R.CIV.P. 52(a).  But even assuming that the Stonewall annexation and June 11, 1969, transfer agreement are linked, the annexation is not void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The annexation of Stonewall was completed under procedures provided by state law.  School districts in Mississippi are political subdivisions, and state law provides procedures for changing their boundaries.  In 1962, the statutory annexation procedure was contained in MISS.CODE ANN. Sec. 6274-06, which provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p>If a petition signed by a majority of the qualified electors of specifically described territory of an existing school district shall be filed with the county board of education requesting that said described territory be taken from such existing district and annexed to an adjacent district, the county board of education, after consideration thereof, and with the consent and approval of the board of trustees of the district to which such territory is to be annexed, shall have the power and authority, in its discretion to take such territory from the existing district and annex same to the adjacent district.  However, before doing so, the county board of education must find and determine that the taking of the territory from the existing school district will not seriously interfere with or impair the efficiency of such school district, and all orders adopted under the provisions of this section shall be invalid unless such finding and determination be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the record show that the necessary steps were fulfilled.  A petition was filed with the Clarke County Superintendent of Education on March 10, 1962;  the Quitman board consented to the annexation on March 12, 1960;  the Clarke County board consented to the annexation on March 14, 1960.  It was only later that Enterprise sued to challenge the annexation (Griffin v. Clarke County Bd. of Educ.).  We accept as true the magistrate judge's finding that Enterprise's court challenge was dropped as part of the Stonewall compromise agreement, an agreement that included that June 11, 1962, contract.  We are unable to tell from the record why Enterprise dropped its legal challenge to the annexation.  Perhaps Enterprise believed that its receipt of transfer students and their attendant funds compensated it for dropping the lawsuit;  or, perhaps Enterprise's appeal had no legal merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An action by a state or its political subdivisions pursuant to established political procedures is not unconstitutional merely because the support for such an action is garnered through the promise of an unconstitutional agreement.  Thus, the annexation is not void merely because Quitman's agreement to transfer the black Stonewall students may have procured Enterprise's agreement to drop its lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that if any part of an unconstitutional agreement is void, all of its provisions must be voided.  Even assuming that the political act of annexation can be linked to the rest of the compromise agreement, we find Enterprise's argument unpersuasive.  None of the authorities cited by Enterprise stands for the proposition that an entire agreement is void if one of its parts or provisions is unconstitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p>D.

Neither before, nor immediately after the annexation, did any black student in either of the two school districts go to the same school with a white student.  The Stonewall annexation was no more promotive of segregation than was any of the other pre-desegregation boundary changes among Mississippi's school districts.  As Quitman points out, Stonewall originally belonged to the Quitman school district and was later transferred to Enterprise under Mississippi's 1953 school reorganization.  If all school district boundary changes during segregation were constitutionally void, then both the original transfer of Stonewall to Enterprise, and its later return to Enterprise, are void.  Thus, Stonewall would belong to Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p>E. Material Breach by Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that Quitman materially breached the agreement by failing to pay money to Enterprise for students transferred from Quitman to Enterprise.  Enterprise claims that, therefore, it is not obligated to honor the part of the agreement transferring Stonewall to Quitman.  But even though Quitman stopped honoring the transfer agreement in 1968, only now does Enterprise claim that the annexation is void because of Quitman's \"material breach.\"   Just as Enterprise is equitably estopped from arguing that the annexation is void as unconstitutional, Enterprise is equitably estopped from arguing that the annexation is void for material breach by Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p>VII. Transfers from Stonewall to Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge ordered the transfer of 100 to 125 black students from the Stonewall area to Enterprise.  Quitman opposes the transfer, arguing that the transfer is not necessitated by Killingsworth and that there has been no showing of constitutional violation.  We agree with Quitman and reverse the magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Stonewall area is lawfully annexed to the Quitman district.  Therefore, the transfer of black students ordered by the magistrate judge is an interdistrict transfer properly analyzed under Milliken.   There has been no showing of a government action with substantial direct, or current segregative, effect.  See Lee, 639 F.2d at 1260.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The annexation of Stonewall was not an interdistrict act of segregation, nor was the transfer agreement.  Mississippi schools were completely segregated before the transfers.  After the transfers, they were still completely segregated.  Furthermore, the transfer agreement has no current segregative effect, because it is no longer operable.  Absent a finding of an interdistrict act, segregative intent, and a continuing segregative effect, the magistrate judge had no discretion to order the transfer of students from Stonewall to Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Killingsworth did not require the interdistrict transfers from Quitman to Enterprise.  The orders of the three-judge court in Killingsworth were reversed.  United States v. Hinds County Sch. Bd., 423 F.2d 1264 (5th Cir.1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1032, 90 S.Ct. 612, 24 L.Ed.2d 531 (1970).  This court did nothing more than order immediate implementation of the HEW plans for Enterprise and Quitman.  Although the HEW plans prohibited certain interdistrict transfers, they did not affirmatively mandate any transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merely because the Killingsworth court was aware of interdistrict transfers does not mean it approved of them.  See United States v. Hinds County Sch. Bd., 516 F.2d 974, 975 (5th Cir.1975) (holding that the fact that the 1969 order did not dismantle school bus routes designed for a segregated school system does not mean that the order approved of the bus routes).  Furthermore, the Killingsworth courts were aware that the transfer agreement would end in twenty-five years.  Thus, if awareness is equated with approval, Killingsworth actually would require the cessation of interdistrict transfers under the June 11, 1962, agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge believed that the transfers of black students from Stonewall was essential to maintain Enterprise.  Since the Killingsworth desegregation order, Enterprise has had a total student enrollment between 768 and 858.  The Enterprise superintendent testified that in order to maintain its accreditation, the school needs from 900 to 1,110 students.  The magistrate judge crafted his order so that enough students attended Enterprise for it to remain viable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of this court eliminating transfers both to and from the Enterprise will not significantly reduce the Enterprise school system.  Even so, we do not think that Enterprise's viability should be a dominant factor in drafting interdistrict transfers.  If insufficient students are transferred to Enterprise by court order, the consequences are not necessarily disastrous.  Enterprise could get more students by transferring more students from other districts, so long as these transfers comport with the desegregation orders and Mississippi state law.  Enterprise could attempt to annex more territory, subject to the same conditions.  If these methods fail, the Enterprise district could be dissolved, provided that the district court is satisfied that the elimination of the district would not reduce desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, the transfer is not necessary to remedy an interdistrict violation, to comply with the Killingsworth order, or to maintain Enterprises's viability.  The magistrate judge abused his discretion in ordering the transfer of students from Stonewall to Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p>VIII.

Because the applicable Mississippi law has changed over the years, we approach this issue chronologically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p>A. 1968-69 Through 1986-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge held that Enterprise should recover from Quitman for the years 1987-88 and 1988-89 but not for previous and subsequent school years.  Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly explain the relevant facts.  Beginning with the June 11, 1962, agreement, black Stonewall students were transferred from the Stonewall area to Enterprise.  At the end of the 1967-68 school year, Quitman refused to pay Enterprise any transfer funds and denied the requests by Stonewall students to transfer to Enterprise.  The Clarke County board overruled Quitman's denials of the transfer requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 12, 1973, Enterprise's lawyer sent a letter to the Quitman superintendent requesting payment of \"certain funds\" the Enterprise board considered due to Enterprise.  On January 9, 1974, Quitman's superintendent indicated that the Quitman school board had reviewed Enterprise's letter and had taken no action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  Enterprise again requested funds on April 10, 1973, September 11, 1973, November 25, 1975, March 8, 1977, June 4, 1987, February 18, 1988, and October 26, 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in December 1988, the magistrate judge signed a series of orders staying the collection of transfer funds and preserving all claims to funds.  The entry of these orders did not relieve the parties of their obligations and liabilities under the applicable Mississippi Code provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No law allows Enterprise to recover during the applicable time period.  Enterprise cannot recover funds under the June 11, 1962, agreement because, as Enterprise admits in its brief, the agreement is void as unconstitutional.  The magistrate judge held that during 1968-69 to 1986-87, no Mississippi statute provided for the interdistrict payment of funds.  A review of the applicable law during this period confirms the magistrate judge's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1962, the Mississippi legislature enacted a statute allowing the transfer of individual students from one school district to another by the mutual consent of the boards of trustees of all school districts concerned.  1962 Miss.  Laws, ch. 357, Sec. 1, codified at MISS. CODE ANN.  Sec. 6248-07 (effective May 10, 1962).  The section provided that certain state funding would follow a transferred student:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p>Legally transferred students going from one school district to another shall be counted for teacher allotment and allotments for other current costs by the school district wherein the pupils attend school, but shall be counted for transportation allotment purposes in the school district which furnishes or provides the transportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  The statute made no provision for payments between districts.  In 1972, the legislature transferred part of the 1962 provision to a newly-created Sec. 37-19-33 (later renumbered Sec. 37-19-27), entitled \"Counting of legally transferred students.\"   Section 37-19-33 contained the same language in the 1962 law quoted above, except that if there was a transfer from one county to another, the county of residence would pay the county at which a child attended school a fee equal to the average cost of educating a child in the county of residence multiplied by the number of students transferred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a>  In 1978, Sec. 37-19-33 was renumbered as Sec. 37-19-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1962 statute does not speak to the allocation of payments.  Only in 1987 was Sec. 37-19-27 amended to provide for payments.  Therefore, the magistrate judge was correct in concluding that no Mississippi law required Quitman to pay Enterprise for the Stonewall transfer students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that it is entitled to recover funds under a theory of quantum meruit.  Quitman has consistently refused to pay money since 1968, and it repudiated the entire agreement in 1977.  Under these circumstances, Enterprise did not have a reasonable expectation of compensation, and therefore it should not recover on a theory of quantum meruit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge held that Enterprise is equitably estopped from asserting claims to funds due for the years 1968-69 to 1986-87.  The magistrate judge found that Quitman stopped paying transfer funds in 1968, that Enterprise made its first demand for payment in 1973, that Enterprise made its second demand in 1987, and that during the intervening fourteen years, Enterprise never initiated suit on the debt it alleged to be due from Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that the magistrate judge erred in finding that Enterprise made no demands upon Quitman from 1973 to 1987.  It appears that the magistrate judge failed to note that Enterprise made additional demands on April 10, 1973, for the 1968-69, 1969-70, and 1971-72 academic years;  on September 11, 1973, for the 1972-73 academic year;  on November 25, 1975, for the 1973-74 and 1974-75 academic years;  and on March 8, 1977, for the 1975-76 academic year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach the issue of whether the magistrate judge made an erroneous factual finding, or whether any such error disturbs his conclusion regarding equitable estoppel.  We have held that Enterprise cannot prevail on its substantive theories of recovery:  contract, state education law, or quantum meruit.  Because Enterprise's arguments are meritless, it does not matter whether Enterprise is equitably estopped from making the arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p>B. 1987-88 and 1988-89 Academic Years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge held that Enterprise should recover from Quitman for the years 1987-88 and 1988-89 under MISS.CODE ANN. Sec. 37-19-27, which required the payment of funds for students transferred between districts in the same county.  The magistrate judge found the amounts to be paid were $81,022.00 for 1987-88 and $124,574.91 for 1988-89.  Quitman challenges the award, arguing that the Clarke County board did not consider on an individual basis the appeals of Quitman's denials of transfer requests, and that therefore the transfers from Stonewall to Enterprise were illegal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987-88 and 1988-89, Quitman refused requests for transfer by Stonewall students who made a joint appeal for transfer to the Clarke County Board.  The joint appeal did not contain any explanation for the transfers of any individual student.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute governing transfer payments during the 1987-88 and 1988-89 academic years was MISS.CODE ANN. Sec. 37-19-27.  In 1987, the Mississippi legislature expanded the coverage of Sec. 37-19-27 from intercounty transfers to interdistrict transfers.  1986 Miss.Laws 1986, ch. 492, Sec. 104 (effective July 1, 1987).  Also, Sec. 37-19-27 was amended to require payments to be made only for \"legally transferred\" students.  The transfers from Stonewall to Enterprise were interdistrict transfers.  Therefore, Sec. 37-19-27 applies.  Under Sec. 37-19-27, Quitman is liable for payments only if the transfers were valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p210\">\n      <span class=\"num\">210</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether the Stonewall students were legally transferred, we turn to Sec. 37-15-31, which sets out the procedure for interdistrict transfers.  Section 37-15-31 provided that if either the transferring or the receiving school board refuses a student's request for transfer,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p>then an appeal may be had to [the] county board of education.

Further, this Court finds that the transfer issue was properly before the Court in USA v. Lauderdale County School District, Cause No. 1367.  During the litigation of Lauderdale County School District, students residing in Northeast Clarke County were attending Clarkdale.  Interrogatories submitted by Lauderdale showed the total number of students residing in Northeast Clarke County and attending Clarkdale.  During the Killingsworth litigation, Enterprise represented to the Court and submitted a map showing the Northeast Clarke County students attending Clarkdale.  Moreover, Enterprise stipulated that its school district is divided into two (2) attendance areas--Enterprise and Clarkdale.  Lastly, as part of an objection to its HEW desegregation plan, Enterprise submitted statistical compilations showing Northeast Clarke County students attending Clarkdale.  In short, the Court finds sufficient evidence to conclude that both the district court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals were aware that Northeast Clarke County students were attending Clarkdale when desegregation plans were approved for Enterprise and Lauderdale and the Court envisioned such transfers would continue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Apparently, neither party challenges the Meehan transfers, which, as we have pointed out earlier, are not reviewable by this court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> See Milliken v.

All of the school districts in Mississippi were reorganized by July 1, 1957.  The three school districts that are parties to this case are Lauderdale, which encompasses all of Lauderdale County except for the City of Meridian;  Enterprise, which encompasses the northern third of Clarke County;  and Quitman, encompassing the southern two-thirds of Clarke County.

The pre-reorganization Clarkdale Line Consolidated School District, which had included territory in both Lauderdale and Clarke counties, was abolished and its territory placed under control of Lauderdale.  The unincorporated area of Meehan, located in Lauderdale County along the border of Clarke County, was also brought under Lauderdale's control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Clarkdale school,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> a de jure white school during segregation, straddles the border between Lauderdale County and Clarke County.  For a number of years, Enterprise and Lauderdale entered into one-year agreements regarding the ownership and operation of Clarkdale.  On February 13, 1962, Lauderdale and Enterprise entered into a twenty-five-year agreement (the \"Clarkdale agreement\") providing that white students from northeastern Clarke County would attend the Clarkdale school and that approximately 100 students in the Meehan area in Lauderdale would attend the all-white Enterprise school in the western part of the Enterprise district.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before desegregation, Lauderdale had one black school, Middleton, which served the entire district.

Enterprise comprised the northern part of the county, including an area called \"Northeast Clarke County,\" the town of Enterprise, the town of Stonewall, and the area surrounding Stonewall.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Quitman comprised the southern part of the county, including the town of Quitman.  In addition to the two school districts, there was the Clarke County Board of Education, which had limited supervisory authority over the transportation of Enterprise and Quitman students and the authority to hear transfer appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise had a white elementary school, a white high school, a black elementary school, a black high school, and the Stonewall school.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Quitman had two black elementary schools, one black high school, one white high school, one white lower elementary school, and one white upper elementary school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1962, Enterprise announced that it would convert the Stonewall school, an all-white school, from grades 1-12 to grades 1-6.  White parents in Stonewall petitioned to have the Stonewall area detached from Enterprise and annexed to Quitman.  The Quitman district passed a resolution to annex the Stonewall area.  The Clarke County Board of Education tabled the Enterprise school district's plan to convert the Stonewall school from grades 1-12 to 1-6 and adopted a resolution detaching the Stonewall territory from Enterprise and annexing it to Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise and Quitman approved a twenty-five-year agreement providing that all blacks in Stonewall would attend the all-black school in Enterprise and that all state funds would be paid to the district where the student attended school.

The court tentatively accepted the \"freedom of choice\" desegregation plan filed by the school districts but, on July 19, 1967, rejected the \"freedom of choice\" plans and entered a final order that (1) enjoined Enterprise, Quitman, and the Clarke County Board of Education from discriminating on the basis of race or color, (2) held that Enterprise, Quitman and the Clarke County Board shall take affirmative action \"to disestablish all school segregation and to eliminate the effects of the dual system,\" (3) allowed all students, irrespective of race or color, to exercise, every year, the choice of which school in their district to attend, (4) held that overcrowding of the particular school chosen will be the only reason for denying the student's choice of which school to attend, and (5) held that there would be no more interdistrict transfers between Enterprise and Quitman \"except on terms and by procedures generally applicable regardless of race.\"   Although asked to do so by plaintiffs in Killingsworth, the court did not find the contract of June 11, 1962, between Enterprise and Quitman unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court consolidated Killingsworth, Lauderdale, and other pending desegregation cases.

On July 3, 1969, in a consolidated appeal that included Lauderdale and Killingsworth, this court reversed and remanded, directing the district court to request the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (\"HEW\") to collaborate with the school boards to develop desegregation plans.

Under the final judgment, the Stonewall territory was deemed to be part of Quitman.  Beginning with the 1992-93 school year, all white students residing in Stonewall would begin attending Quitman schools rather than Enterprise schools.  Any white student in Stonewall desiring to attend Enterprise would have to submit a transfer request in accordance with state law.  High school sophomores, juniors, and seniors enrolled in Enterprise schools in the 1991-92 school year could continue to remain in Enterprise until they graduated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge ordered that, beginning with the 1992-93 school year, Quitman must transfer between 100 and 125 black Stonewall area students to Enterprise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Quitman would pay Enterprise for the students transferred because of the court judgment (i.e., all white students from Stonewall attending Enterprise during the transition years of 1992-93 through 1994-95, and 100 to 125 black students transferred in the years 1992-93 and following years).  The magistrate judge ordered Quitman to pay Enterprise $205,596.91 for Stonewall area students who had attended Enterprise schools in the years 1987-88 and 1988-89 ($81,022.00 for 1987-88 and $124,574.91 for 1988-89).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Northeast Clarke County area, as defined in the Clarkdale agreement of February 1962, was deemed to be part of Enterprise.  Those students residing in Northeast Clarke County, but attending Clarkdale School, were deemed to be transfer students.  The judgment provided for transfers of certain students in Northeast Clarke County to the Clarkdale school.  Beginning with the 1992-93 school year, a maximum of 125 whites would be allowed to transfer to Clarkdale.  Beginning with the 1992-93 school year, all white students attending Clarkdale during the 1991-92 school year, and all white kindergartners, would attend school in the Enterprise school, with the exception of 10th, 11th, and 12th graders, who could remain at Clarkdale.  Any black student who attended Clarkdale could continue to attend Clarkdale if he requested a transfer.  Enterprise would pay Lauderdale $302,562.30 for educating Enterprise's students during the 1985-86, 1986-87, 1987-88, and 1988-89 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 23, 1992, Concerned Citizens made a FED.R.CIV.P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment.

Specifically, the court ordered that, first, the word \"maximum\" would be replaced by the word \"minimum\" in the final judgment regarding the number of white Northeast Clarke County students to be transferred by Enterprise to the Clarkdale school.

Fourth, all siblings of children transferred either from Enterprise to Clarkdale or from Stonewall to Enterprise under the magistrate judge's authority would also be allowed to be transferred.  Fifth, all students with parents working in the Clarkdale School or the Enterprise schools would be allowed to transfer to the school where their parents are employed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 30, 1992, Quitman filed a rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the November 16 order.

Enterprise argues that the magistrate judge erred by ordering transfers from Northeast Clarke County to the Clarkdale school, that it should not be required to pay money to Lauderdale for educating its students, and further, that it should not be required to bus students to Clarkdale.  Quitman argues that the magistrate judge erred by transferring 100 to 125 black students from the Stonewall area to Enterprise and that it does not owe any money to Enterprise for previous transfers.  Quitman agrees with the magistrate judge's decision to allocate the Stonewall area to the Quitman district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the Stonewall area, Enterprise argues that the magistrate judge erred in holding that the annexation to Quitman was valid.  In the event that the annexation is affirmed, Enterprise contends that the transfer of black students from Stonewall to Enterprise should be affirmed.  Enterprise would even want the transfers increased.  Concerned Citizens of Stonewall, Clarke County, Mississippi, as amicus, argues that the Stonewall annexation is invalid and that the Stonewall area should be returned to Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>III.

Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291, a court of appeals has jurisdiction over final, appealable orders of a district court.  28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291.

Regarding Quitman v. Enterprise, the magistrate judge adjudicated the validity of the Stonewall annexation, ordered a transfer of 100-125 black students from Stonewall to Enterprise, and resolved all monetary issues between Quitman and Enterprise.  Regarding Lauderdale v. Enterprise, the magistrate judge ordered that Northeast Clarke County was part of Enterprise, directed the transfer of students from Northeast Clarke County to Lauderdale, required that those students would be considered transfer students, and resolved all monetary issues between Lauderdale and Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the magistrate judge granted two post-judgment motions on November 16, 1992,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> the original July 10 judgment covered all the subject matter of the parties' claims.  Therefore, the July 10 judgment was final and appealable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of finality, we need not consider whether the two cases, Lauderdale v. Enterprise, No. E88-0059(L), and Quitman v. Enterprise, No. E88-0065(L), are one suit or two.  The July 10 judgment disposes of all issues in both of the cases.  The judgment therefore is final, whether the suits are treated as one case or two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>B.

Although this appeal was filed before the effective date of the amendments, courts should apply the amendments \"to the maximum extent possible\" if such application would not \"not work injustice.\"  Burt v.

Enterprise, Enterprise's August 7, 1992, notice of appeal of both cases, and Lauderdale's August 20, 1992, notice of appeal of Lauderdale v. Enterprise.   Quitman's and Enterprise's notices were filed within thirty days of the July 10, 1992, judgment.  Lauderdale's notice of cross-appeal was filed thirteen days after Enterprise's notice of appeal.  Therefore, Lauderdale's notice of appeal was valid under FED.R.APP.P. 4(a)(3), which provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>[i]f one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice of appeal was filed, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period last expires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the two cases are considered separately for notice of appeal purposes, the notices were proper in both cases.  In Lauderdale v. Enterprise, the parties filed their notices of appeal as follows:  Enterprise on August 7, 1992, and Lauderdale on August 20, 1992.  Enterprise's notice was filed within thirty days of July 10.  Lauderdale timely filed its notice of appeal on August 20, within fourteen days of Enterprise's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notices of appeal were also proper in Quitman v. Enterprise.   The parties filed their notices of appeal as follows:  Quitman on July 27, 1992, and Enterprise on August 7, 1992.  Both notices of appeal were timely filed within thirty days of July 10.  Thus, whether the two cases are considered together or separately, the notices of appeal are timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>C.

Enterprise and Quitman argue, therefore, that Concerned Citizens's rule 59(e) motion is invalid and does not affect the validity of the notices of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FED.R.APP.P. 4(a)(4) provides that the time for appeal, usually thirty days, runs from the entry of an order disposing of certain motions, including a motion to alter or amend judgment under rule 59.  Because rule 4(a)(4) applies only if a \"party makes a timely motion of a type specified immediately below\" (emphasis added), it would seem that a motion by a non-party would not defer the thirty-day window.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  We need not determine whether Concerned Citizens's motion was valid, however, as under the amended appellate rules the validity of Concerned Citizens's motion does not affect the notices of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a party makes a rule 59(e) motion, the thirty-day period starts on the day the district court disposes of the motion.  See FED.R.APP.P. 4(a)(4).  Any notice of appeal filed after the final judgment, but before the disposition of the rule 59(e) motion, automatically becomes effective when the district court disposes of the rule 59(e) motion.  Id.  (\"A notice of appeal filed after announcement or entry of the judgment but before entry of any of the above motions is ineffective to appeal from the judgment or order, or part thereof, specified in the notice of appeal, until the date of the entry of the order disposing of the last such motion outstanding.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, even if the rule 59(e) motion were valid, the thirty-day period would have commenced on November 16, 1992, the day the district court disposed of the rule 59(e) motion.  The three notices of appeal were effective on November 16, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>D. The Post-judgment Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge entered a post-judgment order on November 16, 1992.  On November 30, 1992, Quitman filed a rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the order.  Soon afterward, each party filed a notice of appeal of the post-judgment order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  As the magistrate judge has not yet disposed of Quitman's rule 59(e) motion, these notices of appeal are ineffective.  FED.R.APP.P. 4(a)(4).  Thus, we are unable to review the magistrate judge's post-judgment order of November 16, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our answer would not be different if the rule 59(e) motion by Concerned Citizens were a valid rule 59(e) motion for purposes of rule 4(a)(4)(C).  Such a motion would have deferred the effectiveness of the notices of appeal until the motion's disposition on November 16, 1992.  On that date, the final judgment would be immediately reviewable on appeal.  Because of Quitman's rule 59(e) motion of November 30, 1992, we would still be unable to review the post-judgment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might argue that Quitman's rule 59(e) motion, ostensibly filed in the Quitman v. Enterprise case, defers the notices of appeal only in that case and this court still would have appellate jurisdiction over that portion of the post-judgment order pertaining to the other consolidated suit, Lauderdale v. Enterprise.   We reject such a contention.  The two cases were consolidated for the purposes of trial and final judgment.  Suits that are consolidated in district court for trial and disposed of by one final judgment are considered the same case for the purposes of notices of appeal.  Barnett v. Petro-Tex Chem.

Specifically, we cannot review the replacement of the word \"maximum\" with the word \"minimum,\" the transfer of forty students from Meehan to Enterprise, the allocation to Enterprise of the responsibility for busing students from Northeast Clarke County to the Clarkdale school, the transfer of siblings, or the transfer of children with parents employed by the Clarkdale school or the Enterprise school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p>IV. Clarkdale Transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge ordered the transfer of a maximum of 125 white students, and all black students requesting transfers, living in Northeast Clarke County, to attend Lauderdale's Clarkdale school.  The magistrate judge reasoned that, first, the students were closer to Clarkdale and, second, the 1969 desegregation plans for Lauderdale and Enterprise assumed that the transfers would continue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Enterprise argues that the magistrate judge's transfer of students to Clarkdale should be reversed because (1) Enterprise was not a party to the Lauderdale litigation, (2) the transfers violated the Lauderdale desegregation plan, (3) there is no evidence of a constitutional violation by Enterprise, and (4) the transfers threaten Enterprise's viability as a district.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Because there has been no finding of a interdistrict segregative act with a substantial, direct, and current segregative effect, and because the 1969 court orders do not compel student transfers, we reverse the magistrate judge's transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1962, Lauderdale and Enterprise agreed that white students from the northeastern Clarke County area in Enterprise would attend Clarkdale and that approximately 100 students in the Meehan area in Lauderdale would attend the Enterprise school.  When the agreement expired, Enterprise refused to allow any more transfers of its students to Lauderdale.  Enterprise's denials of requests for transfer were overruled by the Clarke County Board of Education until the board was eliminated effective January 1, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge ordered interdistrict transfers, even though neither party had requested it to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Lauderdale asked only for monetary damages in its state court action.  Enterprise in its counterclaim requested only that the 1962 Clarkdale agreement be declared void and that Lauderdale and the Clarke County board be enjoined from ordering the transfer of students to Clarkdale.  But the fact that neither party requested interdistrict transfers does not by itself preclude the district court from ordering such transfers.  The district court retains jurisdiction to desegregate the schools of Lauderdale and Enterprise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  The district court also has the power to enforce the HEW plan for Lauderdale as well as this court's amendments to the plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that federal courts can stop segregation-promoting transfers of students between school districts, place restrictions upon the transfers such as the Singleton provision contained in many of the HEW plans, and remedy violations of Singleton clauses.  It is a different question, however, whether a court can order the interdistrict transfer of students.  For example, if a school district violates the Singleton provision, the appropriate remedy is to end the illegal transfers, not to order broad interdistrict relief:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>A finding that a school district has accepted transfer students in violation of a Singleton clause customarily supports injunctive relief forcing an end to such transfers and compliance with the terms of the desegregation order.

Specifically, it must be shown that racially discriminatory acts of the state or local school districts, or of a single school district have been a substantial cause of interdistrict segregation.  Thus an interdistrict remedy might be in order where the racially discriminatory acts of one or more school districts caused racial segregation in an adjacent district, or where district lines have been deliberately drawn on the basis of race.  In such circumstances an interdistrict remedy would be appropriate to eliminate the interdistrict segregation directly caused by the constitutional violation.  Conversely, without an interdistrict violation and interdistrict effect, there is no constitutional wrong calling for an interdistrict remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 744-45, 94 S.Ct. at 3127.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has noted that Milliken requires that an interdistrict remedy be imposed only upon \"proof of unconstitutional governmental action that has been a substantial cause of a significant interdistrict segregative effect.\"  Lee, 639 F.2d at 1256 (internal quotations omitted).  In Lee, a school district comprising the city of Auburn, Alabama, had been carved out of the larger school district encompassing Lee County.  The county and city school districts reached an agreement whereby some county students would be transferred to city schools.  Because a dual school system existed in both districts, the black students were transferred from their all-black county schools to all-black city schools.  Likewise, the white students were transferred from all-white schools in the county to all-white schools in the city.  We held that these past interdistrict transfers did not justify continuing interdistrict remedies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p>[T]he fact that an interdistrict transfer program was formerly used in order to maintain racial segregation in districts operating dual school systems does not support an interdistrict remedial order unless it is established that these transfer programs have a substantial, direct and current segregative effect.

With the adoption of the HEW plan in 1969, transfers could occur only if done on a nondiscriminatory basis and if they did not reduce desegregation.  There is no record evidence that the pre-desegregation transfers have a \"substantial, direct, and current segregative effect.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the Enterprise desegregation plan nor the Lauderdale desegregation plan, as amended, requires that students continue to be transferred from Enterprise to Lauderdale.  The plans make no mention of any transfers from Enterprise to Clarkdale.  From this silence, Lauderdale urges us to infer that the plans intended the transfers to continue, even after the Clarkdale contract had expired.  We infer the opposite.  The courts and the HEW in 1969 knew that the contract would expire at the end of school year 1986-87, and yet they made no provision to mandate the transfers.  We conclude that the 1969 desegregation plans do not mandate the continued transfer of students from Northeast Clarke County to the Clarkdale school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise makes a number of other arguments that we need not consider.  It contends that the continued viability of the Enterprise school district is essential to the desegregation plan, that the magistrate judge's transfer of students from Enterprise to Clarkdale violates the desegregation plan, that the transfers are void because they significantly contribute to the segregation of the Clarkdale school, and that Enterprise should not be affected by Lauderdale's desegregation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there is no proof that the pre-desegregation transfers of students from Northeast Clarke County to Clarkdale had any substantial, direct, and current segregative effect, we reverse the magistrate judge's order transferring students from Northeast Clarke County to Clarkdale.  We do not, of course, bar Lauderdale and Enterprise from agreeing to future transfers as provided by Mississippi education law.

Killingsworth v. Enterprise Consolidated Sch. Dist., No. 1302(E).  Quitman and Enterprise, pursuant to the preliminary orders entered in the Killingsworth case, submitted desegregation plans that incorporated a grade-by-grade \"freedom of choice\" concept.  These plans were tentatively accepted on August 5, 1965, and revised on September 22, 1966.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through discovery, the Killingsworth plaintiffs were made aware of the June 11, 1962, agreement.  On June 14, 1967, the plaintiffs filed for supplemental relief, requesting the district court to declare the June 11, 1962, agreement unconstitutional.  In its final order, issued July 19, 1967, the district court in Killingsworth did not decide the constitutionality of either the June 11, 1962, agreement or the annexation of Stonewall by Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Killingsworth court's final order held that the previously approved \"freedom of choice\" plans failed to meet the standards for desegregation.  The court specifically enjoined Enterprise, Quitman, and the Clarke County board from discriminating on the basis of race or color, ordered Enterprise, Quitman and the Clarke County board to take affirmative \"action to disestablish all school segregation and to eliminate the effects of the dual school system,\" allowed all students irrespective of race or color to exercise their choice of which school to attend in their respective school districts, held that overcrowding of the particular school chosen would be the only reason for denying a student's choice of which school to attend, and held that there would be no interdistrict transfers between Enterprise and Quitman \"except on terms and by procedures generally applicable regardless of race.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 3, 1969, this court reversed and remanded Killingsworth, requiring desegregation plans to be implemented by August 27, 1969.  The court further ordered that if no plan were submitted by the respective school districts, HEW could file a desegregation proposal on August 11, 1969, and the parties could object thereto.  On August 11, 1969, HEW filed separate desegregation plans for Enterprise and Quitman.

Intradistrict transfers are not allowed under the plans unless the student seeking the transfer would be a minority in the transferee school.  The Singleton provisions in the plans permitted a school board to grant interdistrict transfers only \"on a non-discriminatory basis, except that it shall not consent to transfers where the cumulative effect will reduce desegregation in either district or reinforce the dual school system.\"   On November 6, 1969, this court ruled that the desegregation plans filed by HEW would be implemented immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For each school year between 1968-69 and 1990-91, some students residing in the Stonewall area filed petitions requesting transfers from Quitman to Enterprise.

Enterprise argues that the entire 1962 Stonewall agreement is void because it is unconstitutional.  Enterprise contends that the annexation of Stonewall by Quitman cannot be legally separated from the transfer of all black Stonewall children to Enterprise and that both actions should be voided.  We disagree.  The annexation should be viewed separately from the rest of the agreement.

The magistrate judge held that Enterprise made a representation that the Stonewall territory was lawfully a part of Quitman, that Quitman had sufficiently relied upon these representations, and that Quitman suffered detriment as a result of Enterprise's representations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise admitted that Stonewall belonged to Quitman during the pendency of Killingsworth.   During a December 3, 1969, hearing, Enterprise submitted as evidence a map showing the Stonewall area as part of Quitman.  Enterprise's superintendent testified under oath that the Stonewall territory was annexed to Quitman in 1962.  The transcript of the hearing reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: We've indicated on the map introduced into evidence by stipulation known as the Stonewall area, when was that area detached from the Enterprise School District and made a part of the Quitman district?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: I believe this was in 1962.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, in its objection to HEW's desegregation plan for Enterprise, Enterprise admitted that Stonewall was part of Quitman.  Enterprise's objection reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p>The foregoing facts demonstrate beyond doubt that [Enterprise] is dependent for its financial solvency, the quality of its educational program and its very existence upon pupils who reside outside of [Enterprise] but who have elected to attend the schools administered by [Enterprise].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p>If and when Stonewall Elementary School is closed, the Enterprise Elementary School must be prepared to accommodate additional students from the Stonewall Attendance Zone of the Quitman Consolidated School District, who will, without doubt, elect to attend school at Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).  For over twenty-six years, from June 1962 until June 17, 1988, when suit was filed, Enterprise did nothing to indicate that the Stonewall area had not lawfully been annexed to Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Enterprise asserts that a representation may not be used as a basis for equitable estoppel unless the other party is ignorant of the true facts.  See Chapman v.

Although it is true that Quitman was fully aware of the facts surrounding the annexation, Quitman was unaware that Enterprise would suddenly challenge the annexation after decades of acquiescence.  Equitable estoppel applies to parties who take inconsistent positions.  See United States v.

The admittedly sparse authority on applicability of equitable estoppel indicates the opposite.  Two district courts have held that parties were equitably estopped from arguing constitutional violations.  In Williams v. City of Dothan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442956\"><a href=\"/opinion/442956/george-williams-jr-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-all-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1406</span></a></span> (11th Cir.1984), the district court applied equitable estoppel, although the court of appeals reversed on the ground that the elements of equitable estoppel had not been met.  Id. at 1410.   In Dallas County Commission, the district court, in an alternative holding, held that a party was equitably estopped from arguing a constitutional right.  548 F.Supp. at 872-75.   The doctrine of laches, which is similar to equitable estoppel,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> may prevent a plaintiff from enjoining changes effected without preclearance as required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>  Lopez v.

Enterprise therefore lacks legal support for its argument that equitable estoppel is inapplicable to constitutional claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that equitable estoppel is inapplicable to a governmental entity that is asserting the constitutional rights of a large group of people.

Board of Trustees v. Rye, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1753810\"><a href=\"/opinion/1753810/monroe-county-bd-of-educ-v-rye/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span> (Miss.1988), the case cited by Enterprise, holds, however, that the doctrine may apply to suits by private individual against political subdivisions.  It does not foreclose application in other circumstances:  \"The State, its counties, subdivisions and municipalities may be equitably estopped under the proper circumstances.\"  521 So.2d at 908-09.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that Quitman's belief in the validity of the annexation did not harm Quitman.  We disagree.  Quitman planned, budgeted, forecasted, funded, hired teachers and staff members, paid taxes, and maintained school property since June 11, 1962, under the assumption that the Stonewall territory was properly annexed.  Although Quitman received tax revenues from property in the Stonewall district, Quitman was deprived of state funding for those students who transferred to Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Enterprise claims that it affirmatively made demands on Quitman to pay money to Enterprise.  But this has nothing to do with Enterprise's failure to argue that it owned the Stonewall area, or its representations that it did not own the Stonewall area.  We therefore agree with the magistrate judge that Enterprise is equitably estopped from challenging the validity of the Stonewall annexation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p>B.

Enterprise disagrees, arguing that the issue of annexation was never directly litigated in Killingsworth, and therefore it should not be inferred that the Killingsworth court approved the Stonewall annexation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final desegregation orders in Killingsworth were based upon interdistrict boundaries that assumed the validity of the annexation of Stonewall by Quitman.  Although neither the three-judge district court nor this court in Killingsworth specifically ruled on the validity of the annexation, they did not have cause to do so.  All parties, including Enterprise, represented to the court that the annexation was valid.  Thus, it is not surprising that the record in Killingsworth reveals no debate about the validity of the Stonewall transfers.  We agree with the magistrate judge that it is far too late for Enterprise to protest the annexation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p>C. Separability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that the annexation of Stonewall is void because it is tainted by the unconstitutionality of the June 11, 1962, transfer agreement.  The magistrate judge treated the annexation of Stonewall and the transfer of black students from Stonewall as a part of a larger agreement.  The magistrate's factual finding is not clearly erroneous.  See FED.R.CIV.P. 52(a).  But even assuming that the Stonewall annexation and June 11, 1969, transfer agreement are linked, the annexation is not void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The annexation of Stonewall was completed under procedures provided by state law.  School districts in Mississippi are political subdivisions, and state law provides procedures for changing their boundaries.  In 1962, the statutory annexation procedure was contained in MISS.CODE ANN. Sec. 6274-06, which provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p>If a petition signed by a majority of the qualified electors of specifically described territory of an existing school district shall be filed with the county board of education requesting that said described territory be taken from such existing district and annexed to an adjacent district, the county board of education, after consideration thereof, and with the consent and approval of the board of trustees of the district to which such territory is to be annexed, shall have the power and authority, in its discretion to take such territory from the existing district and annex same to the adjacent district.  However, before doing so, the county board of education must find and determine that the taking of the territory from the existing school district will not seriously interfere with or impair the efficiency of such school district, and all orders adopted under the provisions of this section shall be invalid unless such finding and determination be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the record show that the necessary steps were fulfilled.  A petition was filed with the Clarke County Superintendent of Education on March 10, 1962;  the Quitman board consented to the annexation on March 12, 1960;  the Clarke County board consented to the annexation on March 14, 1960.  It was only later that Enterprise sued to challenge the annexation (Griffin v. Clarke County Bd. of Educ.).  We accept as true the magistrate judge's finding that Enterprise's court challenge was dropped as part of the Stonewall compromise agreement, an agreement that included that June 11, 1962, contract.  We are unable to tell from the record why Enterprise dropped its legal challenge to the annexation.  Perhaps Enterprise believed that its receipt of transfer students and their attendant funds compensated it for dropping the lawsuit;  or, perhaps Enterprise's appeal had no legal merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An action by a state or its political subdivisions pursuant to established political procedures is not unconstitutional merely because the support for such an action is garnered through the promise of an unconstitutional agreement.  Thus, the annexation is not void merely because Quitman's agreement to transfer the black Stonewall students may have procured Enterprise's agreement to drop its lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that if any part of an unconstitutional agreement is void, all of its provisions must be voided.  Even assuming that the political act of annexation can be linked to the rest of the compromise agreement, we find Enterprise's argument unpersuasive.  None of the authorities cited by Enterprise stands for the proposition that an entire agreement is void if one of its parts or provisions is unconstitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p>D. Constitutional Validity of Annexation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A boundary change is void only if it contributes to segregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a>  The Stonewall annexation did not have the effect of increasing segregation.  Neither before, nor immediately after the annexation, did any black student in either of the two school districts go to the same school with a white student.  The Stonewall annexation was no more promotive of segregation than was any of the other pre-desegregation boundary changes among Mississippi's school districts.  As Quitman points out, Stonewall originally belonged to the Quitman school district and was later transferred to Enterprise under Mississippi's 1953 school reorganization.  If all school district boundary changes during segregation were constitutionally void, then both the original transfer of Stonewall to Enterprise, and its later return to Enterprise, are void.  Thus, Stonewall would belong to Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p>E.

Enterprise claims that, therefore, it is not obligated to honor the part of the agreement transferring Stonewall to Quitman.  But even though Quitman stopped honoring the transfer agreement in 1968, only now does Enterprise claim that the annexation is void because of Quitman's \"material breach.\"   Just as Enterprise is equitably estopped from arguing that the annexation is void as unconstitutional, Enterprise is equitably estopped from arguing that the annexation is void for material breach by Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p>VII.

Quitman opposes the transfer, arguing that the transfer is not necessitated by Killingsworth and that there has been no showing of constitutional violation.  We agree with Quitman and reverse the magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Stonewall area is lawfully annexed to the Quitman district.  Therefore, the transfer of black students ordered by the magistrate judge is an interdistrict transfer properly analyzed under Milliken.   There has been no showing of a government action with substantial direct, or current segregative, effect.  See Lee, 639 F.2d at 1260.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The annexation of Stonewall was not an interdistrict act of segregation, nor was the transfer agreement.  Mississippi schools were completely segregated before the transfers.  After the transfers, they were still completely segregated.  Furthermore, the transfer agreement has no current segregative effect, because it is no longer operable.  Absent a finding of an interdistrict act, segregative intent, and a continuing segregative effect, the magistrate judge had no discretion to order the transfer of students from Stonewall to Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Killingsworth did not require the interdistrict transfers from Quitman to Enterprise.  The orders of the three-judge court in Killingsworth were reversed.  United States v. Hinds County Sch. Bd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"289315\"><a href=\"/opinion/289315/united-states-v-hinds-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1264</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1969), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the HEW plans prohibited certain interdistrict transfers, they did not affirmatively mandate any transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merely because the Killingsworth court was aware of interdistrict transfers does not mean it approved of them.  See United States v. Hinds County Sch.

Furthermore, the Killingsworth courts were aware that the transfer agreement would end in twenty-five years.  Thus, if awareness is equated with approval, Killingsworth actually would require the cessation of interdistrict transfers under the June 11, 1962, agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge believed that the transfers of black students from Stonewall was essential to maintain Enterprise.  Since the Killingsworth desegregation order, Enterprise has had a total student enrollment between 768 and 858.  The Enterprise superintendent testified that in order to maintain its accreditation, the school needs from 900 to 1,110 students.  The magistrate judge crafted his order so that enough students attended Enterprise for it to remain viable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of this court eliminating transfers both to and from the Enterprise will not significantly reduce the Enterprise school system.  Even so, we do not think that Enterprise's viability should be a dominant factor in drafting interdistrict transfers.  If insufficient students are transferred to Enterprise by court order, the consequences are not necessarily disastrous.  Enterprise could get more students by transferring more students from other districts, so long as these transfers comport with the desegregation orders and Mississippi state law.  Enterprise could attempt to annex more territory, subject to the same conditions.  If these methods fail, the Enterprise district could be dissolved, provided that the district court is satisfied that the elimination of the district would not reduce desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, the transfer is not necessary to remedy an interdistrict violation, to comply with the Killingsworth order, or to maintain Enterprises's viability.  The magistrate judge abused his discretion in ordering the transfer of students from Stonewall to Enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p>VIII.

Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly explain the relevant facts.  Beginning with the June 11, 1962, agreement, black Stonewall students were transferred from the Stonewall area to Enterprise.  At the end of the 1967-68 school year, Quitman refused to pay Enterprise any transfer funds and denied the requests by Stonewall students to transfer to Enterprise.  The Clarke County board overruled Quitman's denials of the transfer requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 12, 1973, Enterprise's lawyer sent a letter to the Quitman superintendent requesting payment of \"certain funds\" the Enterprise board considered due to Enterprise.  On January 9, 1974, Quitman's superintendent indicated that the Quitman school board had reviewed Enterprise's letter and had taken no action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  Enterprise again requested funds on April 10, 1973, September 11, 1973, November 25, 1975, March 8, 1977, June 4, 1987, February 18, 1988, and October 26, 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in December 1988, the magistrate judge signed a series of orders staying the collection of transfer funds and preserving all claims to funds.  The entry of these orders did not relieve the parties of their obligations and liabilities under the applicable Mississippi Code provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No law allows Enterprise to recover during the applicable time period.  Enterprise cannot recover funds under the June 11, 1962, agreement because, as Enterprise admits in its brief, the agreement is void as unconstitutional.  The magistrate judge held that during 1968-69 to 1986-87, no Mississippi statute provided for the interdistrict payment of funds.  A review of the applicable law during this period confirms the magistrate judge's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1962, the Mississippi legislature enacted a statute allowing the transfer of individual students from one school district to another by the mutual consent of the boards of trustees of all school districts concerned.  1962 Miss.  Laws, ch. 357, Sec. 1, codified at MISS. CODE ANN.  Sec. 6248-07 (effective May 10, 1962).  The section provided that certain state funding would follow a transferred student:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p>Legally transferred students going from one school district to another shall be counted for teacher allotment and allotments for other current costs by the school district wherein the pupils attend school, but shall be counted for transportation allotment purposes in the school district which furnishes or provides the transportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  The statute made no provision for payments between districts.  In 1972, the legislature transferred part of the 1962 provision to a newly-created Sec. 37-19-33 (later renumbered Sec. 37-19-27), entitled \"Counting of legally transferred students.\"   Section 37-19-33 contained the same language in the 1962 law quoted above, except that if there was a transfer from one county to another, the county of residence would pay the county at which a child attended school a fee equal to the average cost of educating a child in the county of residence multiplied by the number of students transferred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a>  In 1978, Sec. 37-19-33 was renumbered as Sec. 37-19-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1962 statute does not speak to the allocation of payments.  Only in 1987 was Sec. 37-19-27 amended to provide for payments.  Therefore, the magistrate judge was correct in concluding that no Mississippi law required Quitman to pay Enterprise for the Stonewall transfer students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that it is entitled to recover funds under a theory of quantum meruit.  Quitman has consistently refused to pay money since 1968, and it repudiated the entire agreement in 1977.  Under these circumstances, Enterprise did not have a reasonable expectation of compensation, and therefore it should not recover on a theory of quantum meruit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge held that Enterprise is equitably estopped from asserting claims to funds due for the years 1968-69 to 1986-87.  The magistrate judge found that Quitman stopped paying transfer funds in 1968, that Enterprise made its first demand for payment in 1973, that Enterprise made its second demand in 1987, and that during the intervening fourteen years, Enterprise never initiated suit on the debt it alleged to be due from Quitman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enterprise argues that the magistrate judge erred in finding that Enterprise made no demands upon Quitman from 1973 to 1987.  It appears that the magistrate judge failed to note that Enterprise made additional demands on April 10, 1973, for the 1968-69, 1969-70, and 1971-72 academic years;  on September 11, 1973, for the 1972-73 academic year;  on November 25, 1975, for the 1973-74 and 1974-75 academic years;  and on March 8, 1977, for the 1975-76 academic year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach the issue of whether the magistrate judge made an erroneous factual finding, or whether any such error disturbs his conclusion regarding equitable estoppel.  We have held that Enterprise cannot prevail on its substantive theories of recovery:  contract, state education law, or quantum meruit.  Because Enterprise's arguments are meritless, it does not matter whether Enterprise is equitably estopped from making the arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p>B. 1987-88 and 1988-89 Academic Years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge held that Enterprise should recover from Quitman for the years 1987-88 and 1988-89 under MISS.CODE ANN. Sec. 37-19-27, which required the payment of funds for students transferred between districts in the same county.  The magistrate judge found the amounts to be paid were $81,022.00 for 1987-88 and $124,574.91 for 1988-89.  Quitman challenges the award, arguing that the Clarke County board did not consider on an individual basis the appeals of Quitman's denials of transfer requests, and that therefore the transfers from Stonewall to Enterprise were illegal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987-88 and 1988-89, Quitman refused requests for transfer by Stonewall students who made a joint appeal for transfer to the Clarke County Board.  The joint appeal did not contain any explanation for the transfers of any individual student.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute governing transfer payments during the 1987-88 and 1988-89 academic years was MISS.CODE ANN. Sec. 37-19-27.  In 1987, the Mississippi legislature expanded the coverage of Sec. 37-19-27 from intercounty transfers to interdistrict transfers.  1986 Miss.Laws 1986, ch. 492, Sec. 104 (effective July 1, 1987).  Also, Sec. 37-19-27 was amended to require payments to be made only for \"legally transferred\" students.  The transfers from Stonewall to Enterprise were interdistrict transfers.  Therefore, Sec. 37-19-27 applies.  Under Sec. 37-19-27, Quitman is liable for payments only if the transfers were valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p210\">\n      <span class=\"num\">210</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether the Stonewall students were legally transferred, we turn to Sec. 37-15-31, which sets out the procedure for interdistrict transfers.  Section 37-15-31 provided that if either the transferring or the receiving school board refuses a student's request for transfer,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p>then an appeal may be had to [the] county board of education.  The said county board of education to which said appeal is taken shall act thereon not later than the date of its next regular meeting subsequent to the disapproval or failure to act by the school board by the school board of said school district, or not later than the date of its next regular meeting subsequent to the filing of such appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p212\">\n      <span class=\"num\">212</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MISS.CODE ANN. Sec. 37-15-31.  Section 37-15-31 did not require the county school board to consider of transfers \"on an individual basis.\"   We therefore conclude that the actions of the Clarke County board, and the subsequent transfer of the Stonewall students, were legal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p213\">\n      <span class=\"num\">213</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quitman argues that the Stonewall transfers violated Section 37-15-15.  Section 37-15-15, which governs intradistrict assignments, requires school boards to assign students within a particular district \"on an individual basis.\"   It reads in full:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p214\">\n      <span class=\"num\">214</span>\n      <p>In making assignments of children to schools or attendance centers, the school board shall take into consideration the educational needs and welfare of the child involved, the welfare and best interest of all the pupils attending the school or schools involved, the availability of school facilities, sanitary conditions and facilities at the school or schools involved, health and moral factors at the school or schools, and in the community involved, and all other factors which the school board may consider pertinent, relevant or material in their effect on the welfare and best interest of the school district and the particular school or schools involved.  All such assignments shall be on an individual basis as to the particular child involved and, in making such assignment, the school board shall not be limited or circumscribed by the boundaries of any attendance areas which may have been established by such board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p215\">\n      <span class=\"num\">215</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MISS.CODE ANN.

Initially, it would make little sense from an academic standpoint to require all Northeast Clarke County students to travel multiple distances to attend Enterprise School when a school constructed for their benefit is located several miles away.  Further, this Court finds that the transfer issue was properly before the Court in USA v. Lauderdale County School District, Cause No. 1367.  During the litigation of Lauderdale County School District, students residing in Northeast Clarke County were attending Clarkdale.  Interrogatories submitted by Lauderdale showed the total number of students residing in Northeast Clarke County and attending Clarkdale.  During the Killingsworth litigation, Enterprise represented to the Court and submitted a map showing the Northeast Clarke County students attending Clarkdale.  Moreover, Enterprise stipulated that its school district is divided into two (2) attendance areas--Enterprise and Clarkdale.  Lastly, as part of an objection to its HEW desegregation plan, Enterprise submitted statistical compilations showing Northeast Clarke County students attending Clarkdale.  In short, the Court finds sufficient evidence to conclude that both the district court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals were aware that Northeast Clarke County students were attending Clarkdale when desegregation plans were approved for Enterprise and Lauderdale and the Court envisioned such transfers would continue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Apparently, neither party challenges the Meehan transfers, which, as we have pointed out earlier, are not reviewable by this court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> See Milliken v.
