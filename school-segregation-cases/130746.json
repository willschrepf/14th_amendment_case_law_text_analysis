(hereinafter referred to as\n\n“Kamit”), received from the District of Columbia a quarterly operating budget\n\nappropriation of $703,691 for the upcoming school year. These funds were placed\n\nin an escrow account while Kamit challenged its charter revocation in Superior\n\nCourt. With the PCSB’s approval, some of the escrowed funds were disbursed to\n\nKamit to cover operating expenses it incurred notwithstanding that its charter\n\nschool was closed. However, the PCSB refused to release the remaining balance in\n\nescrow, $165,936.33, to reimburse Kamit for severance payments it had made to\n\nits departing faculty and staff. The Superior Court declined to overrule the PCSB’s\n\ndecision and ordered that the funds remaining in the escrow account be returned to\n\nthe District of Columbia. Kamit, still claiming entitlement to those funds, has\n\nappealed the court’s rulings denying its request for reimbursement. We conclude,\n\nhowever, that because Kamit’s charter has been revoked and the PCSB is charged\n\nby law with liquidating its assets, settling its debts and conveying any surplus to\n\nthe District, Kamit has no legally cognizable interest in the funds at issue and lacks\n\nstanding to maintain this appeal.\n\f                                          3\n\n                                          I.\n\n\n\n      Kamit was formed in 1999 as a District of Columbia nonprofit corporation\n\nwith the purpose, according to its articles of incorporation, of securing a charter to\n\noperate a public charter school pursuant to the School Reform Act of 1995.1 The\n\nBoard of Education granted Kamit a charter in June 2000.            Ten years later,\n\nhowever, on June 21, 2010, the PCSB initiated proceedings to revoke Kamit’s\n\ncharter.2 These administrative proceedings culminated in the PCSB’s revocation\n\nof Kamit’s charter on August 12, 2010. Kamit immediately filed a petition in\n\nSuperior Court for judicial review of the PCSB’s decision, along with an\n\nemergency motion to stay the revocation. The stay was denied, and after further\n\nproceedings, the Superior Court upheld the decision to revoke Kamit’s charter in\n\nMay 2011. This court affirmed that ruling in Kamit I. 3\n\n\n\n\n      1\n         Now codified, as amended, at D.C. Code § 38-1802.01 et seq. (2012\nRepl.). An entity must be organized as a nonprofit corporation in order to be\ngranted a charter to operate a public charter school. Id. § 38-1802.04 (c)(16).\n      2\n          See id. §§ 38-1802.01 (f), -1802.13.\n      3\n         See Kamit Institute for Magnificent Achievers v. District of Columbia\nPublic Charter School Board (Kamit I), 55 A.3d 894, 903 (D.C. 2012).\n\f                                         4\n\n      The revocation of Kamit’s charter is now final. The present appeal concerns\n\nan ancillary dispute having its genesis in events that occurred in July 2010 while\n\nthe revocation proceedings were under way before the PCSB. First, on July 13,\n\nKamit’s board of trustees met and approved a severance package for all eligible\n\nfaculty and staff as an incentive for them not to leave the school while it was still\n\nseeking to retain its charter. The board agreed that these employees would receive\n\nthe equivalent of one month of salary for each year they had worked at Kamit; that\n\nemployees who had been with the school for over one year would receive the cash\n\nequivalent of six months of healthcare benefits (and those employed for less than a\n\nyear would receive the cash equivalent of one month of healthcare benefits); and\n\nthat all eligible employees would be compensated for their accrued and unused\n\nvacation and sick leave and for their pension allocations. This severance package\n\nwas outlined to members of the faculty and staff at a meeting on July 14. Kamit\n\nsubsequently executed written severance agreements with its employees after its\n\nmotion to stay the revocation of its charter was denied. Under these agreements\n\nKamit eventually paid $361,253.90 in severance and associated payroll taxes.\n\n\n\n      Second, on July 15, 2010, Kamit received its initial quarterly operating\n\nbudget appropriation payment from the District government for the 2010-11 school\n\nyear. The amount of this payment, $703,691, was based on Kamit’s projected\n\f                                           5\n\nstudent enrollment for the school year in accordance with a uniform per student\n\nfunding formula.4 After the PCSB revoked Kamit’s charter, the District moved to\n\nintervene in the ensuing Superior Court proceedings “in order,” it explained, “to\n\nprotect its interest, and that of its citizens, in the $703,691 in public funds that the\n\nDistrict disbursed.” The motion to intervene was granted. The District then filed a\n\nthird-party complaint against Kamit and a motion seeking the immediate return of\n\nthe July 15 operating budget appropriation payment on the ground that Kamit,\n\nlacking a charter, would not be schooling any children in the 2010-2011 school\n\nyear.       Kamit opposed this relief on the grounds that it had incurred some\n\nreimbursable operating expenses in preparation for starting the school year and\n\nwould be unable to pay its legitimate creditors if the relief were granted.\n\n\n\n        On September 20, 2010, the parties agreed to deposit the $703,691 in an\n\nescrow account from which Kamit could receive disbursements for eligible\n\nexpenses pursuant to the terms of an escrow order entered by the court. The order\n\n        4\n          See D.C. Code §§ 38-2902, -2906, -2906.02 (2012 Repl.). Section\n2906.02 (h) now provides that when a public charter school’s charter is pending\nrevocation, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education shall hold the July\n15 payment in escrow, and that “[u]pon a final revocation decision, the Mayor\nshall have no obligation to release the escrow funds.” However, this provision,\nadded to the statute in 2011 by D.C. Law 19-21, § 4032, was not in effect when\nKamit’s charter was revoked. See 58 D.C. Reg. 6226 (July 29, 2011), 8470 (Oct.\n7, 2011).\n\f                                         6\n\nrequired Kamit and the PCSB to “meet and confer in good faith with respect to any\n\nexpenses of [Kamit] that should be paid from the escrowed funds.” In the event\n\nthe PCSB did not consent to a requested disbursement, the order provided that, on\n\nKamit’s motion, the Superior Court would “rule on the propriety of the expenses.”\n\n\n\n      Following the entry of this order, the PCSB agreed to release funds from the\n\nescrow account to reimburse Kamit for a number of expenses, including rent and\n\nutilities for the facility that Kamit leased from the District through November 2010\n\nand the salaries of employees who remained on the payroll through the first week\n\nof December for wind-down purposes. These approved disbursements reduced the\n\nbalance in the escrow account to $165,936.33. Kamit requested the PCSB to\n\nrelease these remaining funds to it as (partial) reimbursement for the severance\n\npayments it had made to its former employees. The PCSB, taking the position that\n\nthe severance payments were not operating expenses incurred in preparation for the\n\n2010-11 school year, refused Kamit’s request. Kamit thereupon moved in Superior\n\nCourt for disbursement of the funds pursuant to the dispute resolution provision in\n\nthe escrow order.\n\n\n\n      On December 2, 2011, the court denied Kamit’s motion, finding that “Kamit\n\nhas not offered any reason for the court to view this escrow account as the\n\f                                          7\n\ndesignated source of funding for its severance contracts.” In recognition of the\n\nPCSB’s “authority to oversee settling of debts, liquidation of assets, and the return\n\nto the [Office of the State Superintendent of Education] of remaining assets”\n\nfollowing the revocation of a public charter school’s charter, the court decided to\n\n“leave[] it to PCSB whether Kamit should be recompensed for its generosity to its\n\nemployees.” The District then moved for the return of the remaining balance in the\n\nescrow account.     The court granted that motion and ordered the funds to be\n\nreleased to the District. Kamit timely appealed both of the court’s rulings.\n\n\n\n                                         II.\n\n\n\n      In this court, Kamit contends that the Superior Court erred by not ruling on\n\nthe “propriety” of its severance expenses. Instead of deferring to the judgment of\n\nthe PCSB, Kamit argues, the court should have deferred under the business\n\njudgment rule to the decision by Kamit’s board of trustees to enter into the\n\nseverance agreements.5      The District and the PCSB disagree with Kamit’s\n\n\n\n      5\n          Under the business judgment rule,\n\n              directors’ decisions will be respected by courts unless the\n              directors are interested or lack independence relative to\n              the decision, do not act in good faith, act in a manner that\n              cannot be attributed to a rational business purpose or\n                                                                         (continued…)\n\f                                          8\n\narguments on the merits. As a threshold matter, however, they argue that Kamit\n\nhas no standing to maintain this appeal. We agree with appellees on this point and\n\ndo not reach any other issues.6\n\n\n\n      At a minimum, for Kamit to establish standing to obtain the relief it seeks, it\n\nmust demonstrate that the denial of reimbursement for its severance payments from\n\nthe escrowed funds caused it to suffer an “injury in fact” that may be “redressed by\n\n\n\n\n(continued…)\n           reach their decision by a grossly negligent process that\n           includes the failure to consider all material facts\n           reasonably available.\n\nBehradrezaee v. Dashtara, 910 A.2d 349, 361 (D.C. 2006).\n      6\n          Appellees first challenged Kamit’s standing in a motion to dismiss the\nappeal, which a motions panel of this court denied in a one-page order. That denial\nwas without prejudice, however, to our reconsideration of the issue of standing.\nSee In re J.A.P., 749 A.2d 715, 717 (D.C. 2000) (“[E]ven when a motions division\nof this court has allowed the appeal to proceed, . . . the division assigned to decide\nthe merits is not bound by that order if, after briefing and consideration, it\nconcludes that the standards governing appeal under the statute are not satisfied.”);\nKleinbart v. United States, 604 A.2d 861, 867 (D.C. 1992) (“[W]hen a motions\ndivision denies a motion to dismiss . . . , such denials shall be deemed to be\nwithout prejudice to reconsideration by a Merits Division unless expressly denied\nwith prejudice.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). We exercise our discretion to\nreconsider Kamit’s standing because “we do not believe that the issue was\nthoroughly aired and definitively resolved” at the motions stage. Id.\n\f                                           9\n\na favorable decision.”7 To demonstrate an injury in fact, Kamit must show “an\n\ninvasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and\n\n(b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”8 Moreover, it is not\n\nenough that Kamit may have had standing to seek reimbursement from the\n\nescrowed funds at the outset of this litigation, or even when it noted its appeals of\n\nthe Superior Court’s rulings. The requisites of standing must continue to be met as\n\nlong as the appeals continue.9 As we shall see, because the revocation of Kamit’s\n\ncharter has become final, Kamit by law has lost any interest it may have had in the\n\nescrowed funds, or in being reimbursed, and so it now cannot satisfy the\n\nrequirements of standing.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       Grayson v.

Code § 38-\n\n1802.01 et seq.10 Among those provisions is § 38-1802.13a, entitled “Mandatory\n\ndissolution.” This section was added to the SRA by D.C. Law 16-268, the Public\n\nCharter School Assets and Facilities Preservation Amendment Act of 2006. It\n\nbecame effective on March 14, 2007.11 It provides that a nonprofit corporation\n\noperating a charter school “shall dissolve” if the charter has been revoked,12 and\n\nthat upon revocation, the chartering authority (i.e., the PCSB13), “in consultation\n\nwith” the charter school’s board of trustees, “shall develop and execute a plan for”\n\nliquidating the corporation’s assets, discharging the corporation’s debts, and\n\ndistributing any remaining assets “to the District of Columbia, to be controlled by\n\nthe Office of Education Facilities and Partnerships within the State Education\n\n\n\n\n      10\n         See Kamit I, 55 A.3d at 896; Richard Milburn Pub.

Code § 38-1802.13a (a)(1) (2012 Repl.).\n      13\n         Although Kamit received its charter in 2000 from the Board of Education,\nthe Board’s powers and duties as chartering authority were transferred to the PCSB\nin 2007. See id. § 38-1802.01 (f).\n\f                                          11\n\nOffice and used solely for educational purposes.”14 For these purposes, the board\n\nof trustees is required, “[a]s soon as feasible,” to submit a “closeout audit” to the\n\nPCSB.15\n\n\n\n      According to the Committee Report on the bill that added § 38-1802.13a to\n\nthe SRA in 2007, its purpose was “to ensure that public funds invested in charter\n\nschools are returned to the public for continued use in support of education needs\n\nwhen a charter school ceases to operate as a charter school.”16 Prior to 2007 this\n\nhad been a problem, the Committee Report explained, because a nonprofit\n\ncorporation organized and empowered by statute to operate a charter school could\n\nremain in existence after the school closed, with “no purpose and no powers,” and\n\nwithout “any explicit guidance for the disposition of [the] corporation, its liabilities\n\n\n\n\n      14\n          D.C. Code § 38-1802.13a (d)(1), (2)(A). The statute further provides that\nthe plan of liquidation and distribution of assets must comport with the terms of\nexisting creditor agreements and applicable laws, and that “creditors shall retain all\nrights, powers, and remedies available to them to cure default as defined in their\nagreements with the charter school.” Id. § 38-1802.13a (d)(2)(B).\n      15\n           Id. § 38-1802.13a (d)(3).\n      16\n           Council of the District of Columbia, Committee on Education, Libraries,\nand Recreation, Report on Bill 16-624, the “Public Charter School Assets and\nFacilities Preservation Amendment Act of 2006,” at 1 (Nov. 28, 2006) [hereinafter\n“Committee Report”].\n\f                                          12\n\nor its assets.”17 As a result of this “lack of clarity,” the Board of Education and the\n\nPCSB “ha[d] experienced difficulties when closing charter schools and ha[d]\n\nexpressed a need for specific legislation to provide clarity on the process to be\n\nfollowed in such circumstances.”18 Section 38-1802.13a addressed this perceived\n\nneed by providing that a nonprofit corporation organized to operate a charter\n\nschool “must be dissolved” after the school closes, and by specifying the\n\nprocedures to be followed for “protecting the investment of public dollars in these\n\nschools.”19\n\n\n\n      Although the foregoing requirements of § 38-1802.13a took effect in 2007,\n\nthey apply to pre-existing charter schools such as Kamit. This is made explicit in\n\nsubsection (c) of the statute.     The first paragraph of subsection (c) requires\n\nnonprofit corporations operating public charter schools to acknowledge in their\n\n      17\n           Id. at 6.\n      18\n           Id. As an example of the need for the proposed bill, the Committee\nReport cited a public charter school that had received millions of dollars in public\nfunds during the five years it was in operation. “After surrendering the school’s\ncharter . . . , the Board of Trustees . . . proceeded to sell the facility on the open\nmarket and earned considerable profits on this transaction.

Subsection (a) of § 38-1802.12 (“Charter\nrenewal”) provides that “[a] charter granted to a public charter school shall remain\nin force for a 15-year period” and “may be renewed for an unlimited number of\ntimes, each time for a 15-year period.”\n      22\n           Id. § 38-1802.13a (c)(3).\n\f                                          14\n\n      In its brief, Kamit suggests that § 38-1802.13a cannot be applied to it\n\nwithout violating the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution,23 but it has\n\narticulated no argument in support of that claim. In particular, Kamit has identified\n\nno obligation of the contract granting its charter (or of any other contract) that is\n\nimpaired by § 38-1802.13a.24 We therefore consider Kamit to have waived any\n\nclaim of a Contract Clause violation.25\n\n\n\n      Consequently, now that the revocation of Kamit’s charter is no longer\n\nsubject to legal challenge, Kamit must relinquish all control over its assets and\n\ncease its existence.

Kamit has no residual interest in\n\nany surplus; by law it all goes to the District.26 Kamit thus has no “legally\n\nprotected interest” in the escrowed funds at issue in this appeal—it cannot benefit\n\nby obtaining those funds, since the PCSB would dispose of them in any event, and\n\nit suffers no injury by being deprived of them. In other words, Kamit has nothing\n\nto gain by pursuing this appeal. It therefore lacks standing to do so, and the appeal\n\nmust be dismissed.\n\n\n\n                                                    So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n      26\n           In its response to appellees’ motion to dismiss its appeal, Kamit argued\nthat it retains an interest in funds it received from private (as opposed to public)\nsources. It is not clear why this should be so; the mandatory dissolution provisions\nof the SRA do not distinguish between privately and publicly contributed funds\nand leave it to the PCSB to determine whether any private donations must be\nreturned to the donors or redirected because the school closed. However, because\n(as Kamit’s counsel acknowledged at oral argument) there is no evidence in the\nrecord that Kamit actually possesses any segregated, privately contributed funds,\nany potential issue presented by the existence of such funds is not before us.\n\f",

(hereinafter referred to as\n\n“Kamit”), received from the District of Columbia a quarterly operating budget\n\nappropriation of $703,691 for the upcoming school year. These funds were placed\n\nin an escrow account while Kamit challenged its charter revocation in Superior\n\nCourt. With the PCSB’s approval, some of the escrowed funds were disbursed to\n\nKamit to cover operating expenses it incurred notwithstanding that its charter\n\nschool was closed. However, the PCSB refused to release the remaining balance in\n\nescrow, $165,936.33, to reimburse Kamit for severance payments it had made to\n\nits departing faculty and staff. The Superior Court declined to overrule the PCSB’s\n\ndecision and ordered that the funds remaining in the escrow account be returned to\n\nthe District of Columbia. Kamit, still claiming entitlement to those funds, has\n\nappealed the court’s rulings denying its request for reimbursement. We conclude,\n\nhowever, that because Kamit’s charter has been revoked and the PCSB is charged\n\nby law with liquidating its assets, settling its debts and conveying any surplus to\n\nthe District, Kamit has no legally cognizable interest in the funds at issue and lacks\n\nstanding to maintain this appeal.\n\f                                          3\n\n                                          I.\n\n\n\n      Kamit was formed in 1999 as a District of Columbia nonprofit corporation\n\nwith the purpose, according to its articles of incorporation, of securing a charter to\n\noperate a public charter school pursuant to the School Reform Act of 1995.1 The\n\nBoard of Education granted Kamit a charter in June 2000.            Ten years later,\n\nhowever, on June 21, 2010, the PCSB initiated proceedings to revoke Kamit’s\n\ncharter.2 These administrative proceedings culminated in the PCSB’s revocation\n\nof Kamit’s charter on August 12, 2010. Kamit immediately filed a petition in\n\nSuperior Court for judicial review of the PCSB’s decision, along with an\n\nemergency motion to stay the revocation. The stay was denied, and after further\n\nproceedings, the Superior Court upheld the decision to revoke Kamit’s charter in\n\nMay 2011. This court affirmed that ruling in Kamit I. 3\n\n\n\n\n      1\n         Now codified, as amended, at D.C. Code § 38-1802.01 et seq. (2012\nRepl.).

The present appeal concerns\n\nan ancillary dispute having its genesis in events that occurred in July 2010 while\n\nthe revocation proceedings were under way before the PCSB. First, on July 13,\n\nKamit’s board of trustees met and approved a severance package for all eligible\n\nfaculty and staff as an incentive for them not to leave the school while it was still\n\nseeking to retain its charter. The board agreed that these employees would receive\n\nthe equivalent of one month of salary for each year they had worked at Kamit; that\n\nemployees who had been with the school for over one year would receive the cash\n\nequivalent of six months of healthcare benefits (and those employed for less than a\n\nyear would receive the cash equivalent of one month of healthcare benefits); and\n\nthat all eligible employees would be compensated for their accrued and unused\n\nvacation and sick leave and for their pension allocations. This severance package\n\nwas outlined to members of the faculty and staff at a meeting on July 14. Kamit\n\nsubsequently executed written severance agreements with its employees after its\n\nmotion to stay the revocation of its charter was denied. Under these agreements\n\nKamit eventually paid $361,253.90 in severance and associated payroll taxes.\n\n\n\n      Second, on July 15, 2010, Kamit received its initial quarterly operating\n\nbudget appropriation payment from the District government for the 2010-11 school\n\nyear. The amount of this payment, $703,691, was based on Kamit’s projected\n\f                                           5\n\nstudent enrollment for the school year in accordance with a uniform per student\n\nfunding formula.4 After the PCSB revoked Kamit’s charter, the District moved to\n\nintervene in the ensuing Superior Court proceedings “in order,” it explained, “to\n\nprotect its interest, and that of its citizens, in the $703,691 in public funds that the\n\nDistrict disbursed.” The motion to intervene was granted. The District then filed a\n\nthird-party complaint against Kamit and a motion seeking the immediate return of\n\nthe July 15 operating budget appropriation payment on the ground that Kamit,\n\nlacking a charter, would not be schooling any children in the 2010-2011 school\n\nyear.       Kamit opposed this relief on the grounds that it had incurred some\n\nreimbursable operating expenses in preparation for starting the school year and\n\nwould be unable to pay its legitimate creditors if the relief were granted.\n\n\n\n        On September 20, 2010, the parties agreed to deposit the $703,691 in an\n\nescrow account from which Kamit could receive disbursements for eligible\n\nexpenses pursuant to the terms of an escrow order entered by the court. The order\n\n        4\n          See D.C. Code §§ 38-2902, -2906, -2906.02 (2012 Repl.). Section\n2906.02 (h) now provides that when a public charter school’s charter is pending\nrevocation, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education shall hold the July\n15 payment in escrow, and that “[u]pon a final revocation decision, the Mayor\nshall have no obligation to release the escrow funds.” However, this provision,\nadded to the statute in 2011 by D.C. Law 19-21, § 4032, was not in effect when\nKamit’s charter was revoked. See 58 D.C. Reg. 6226 (July 29, 2011), 8470 (Oct.\n7, 2011).\n\f                                         6\n\nrequired Kamit and the PCSB to “meet and confer in good faith with respect to any\n\nexpenses of [Kamit] that should be paid from the escrowed funds.” In the event\n\nthe PCSB did not consent to a requested disbursement, the order provided that, on\n\nKamit’s motion, the Superior Court would “rule on the propriety of the expenses.”\n\n\n\n      Following the entry of this order, the PCSB agreed to release funds from the\n\nescrow account to reimburse Kamit for a number of expenses, including rent and\n\nutilities for the facility that Kamit leased from the District through November 2010\n\nand the salaries of employees who remained on the payroll through the first week\n\nof December for wind-down purposes. These approved disbursements reduced the\n\nbalance in the escrow account to $165,936.33. Kamit requested the PCSB to\n\nrelease these remaining funds to it as (partial) reimbursement for the severance\n\npayments it had made to its former employees. The PCSB, taking the position that\n\nthe severance payments were not operating expenses incurred in preparation for the\n\n2010-11 school year, refused Kamit’s request. Kamit thereupon moved in Superior\n\nCourt for disbursement of the funds pursuant to the dispute resolution provision in\n\nthe escrow order.\n\n\n\n      On December 2, 2011, the court denied Kamit’s motion, finding that “Kamit\n\nhas not offered any reason for the court to view this escrow account as the\n\f                                          7\n\ndesignated source of funding for its severance contracts.” In recognition of the\n\nPCSB’s “authority to oversee settling of debts, liquidation of assets, and the return\n\nto the [Office of the State Superintendent of Education] of remaining assets”\n\nfollowing the revocation of a public charter school’s charter, the court decided to\n\n“leave[] it to PCSB whether Kamit should be recompensed for its generosity to its\n\nemployees.” The District then moved for the return of the remaining balance in the\n\nescrow account.     The court granted that motion and ordered the funds to be\n\nreleased to the District. Kamit timely appealed both of the court’s rulings.\n\n\n\n                                         II.\n\n\n\n      In this court, Kamit contends that the Superior Court erred by not ruling on\n\nthe “propriety” of its severance expenses. Instead of deferring to the judgment of\n\nthe PCSB, Kamit argues, the court should have deferred under the business\n\njudgment rule to the decision by Kamit’s board of trustees to enter into the\n\nseverance agreements.5      The District and the PCSB disagree with Kamit’s\n\n\n\n      5\n          Under the business judgment rule,\n\n              directors’ decisions will be respected by courts unless the\n              directors are interested or lack independence relative to\n              the decision, do not act in good faith, act in a manner that\n              cannot be attributed to a rational business purpose or\n                                                                         (continued…)\n\f                                          8\n\narguments on the merits. As a threshold matter, however, they argue that Kamit\n\nhas no standing to maintain this appeal. We agree with appellees on this point and\n\ndo not reach any other issues.6\n\n\n\n      At a minimum, for Kamit to establish standing to obtain the relief it seeks, it\n\nmust demonstrate that the denial of reimbursement for its severance payments from\n\nthe escrowed funds caused it to suffer an “injury in fact” that may be “redressed by\n\n\n\n\n(continued…)\n           reach their decision by a grossly negligent process that\n           includes the failure to consider all material facts\n           reasonably available.\n\nBehradrezaee v.

The requisites of standing must continue to be met as\n\nlong as the appeals continue.9 As we shall see, because the revocation of Kamit’s\n\ncharter has become final, Kamit by law has lost any interest it may have had in the\n\nescrowed funds, or in being reimbursed, and so it now cannot satisfy the\n\nrequirements of standing.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       Grayson v.

The statute further provides that\nthe plan of liquidation and distribution of assets must comport with the terms of\nexisting creditor agreements and applicable laws, and that “creditors shall retain all\nrights, powers, and remedies available to them to cure default as defined in their\nagreements with the charter school.” Id. § 38-1802.13a (d)(2)(B).\n      15\n           Id. § 38-1802.13a (d)(3).\n      16\n           Council of the District of Columbia, Committee on Education, Libraries,\nand Recreation, Report on Bill 16-624, the “Public Charter School Assets and\nFacilities Preservation Amendment Act of 2006,” at 1 (Nov. 28, 2006) [hereinafter\n“Committee Report”].\n\f                                          12\n\nor its assets.”17 As a result of this “lack of clarity,” the Board of Education and the\n\nPCSB “ha[d] experienced difficulties when closing charter schools and ha[d]\n\nexpressed a need for specific legislation to provide clarity on the process to be\n\nfollowed in such circumstances.”18 Section 38-1802.13a addressed this perceived\n\nneed by providing that a nonprofit corporation organized to operate a charter\n\nschool “must be dissolved” after the school closes, and by specifying the\n\nprocedures to be followed for “protecting the investment of public dollars in these\n\nschools.”19\n\n\n\n      Although the foregoing requirements of § 38-1802.13a took effect in 2007,\n\nthey apply to pre-existing charter schools such as Kamit. This is made explicit in\n\nsubsection (c) of the statute.     The first paragraph of subsection (c) requires\n\nnonprofit corporations operating public charter schools to acknowledge in their\n\n      17\n           Id. at 6.\n      18\n           Id. As an example of the need for the proposed bill, the Committee\nReport cited a public charter school that had received millions of dollars in public\nfunds during the five years it was in operation. “After surrendering the school’s\ncharter . . . , the Board of Trustees . . . proceeded to sell the facility on the open\nmarket and earned considerable profits on this transaction. Even though the\nfacility and its operation were constructed and maintained almost exclusively with\npublic funds, the proceeds from this investment were not available to the District\nfor continued use in support of educational needs.” Id.\n      19\n           Id. at 6-7.\n\f                                         13\n\narticles of incorporation or bylaws that they will dissolve and return their\n\nremaining assets to the State Education Office of the District of Columbia if their\n\ncharters are revoked.20 The second paragraph of subsection (c) grants a temporary\n\nexemption from the requirement of the first paragraph; it states that “[a] nonprofit\n\ncorporation with an existing charter as of March 14, 2007, shall not be required to\n\namend its articles of incorporation or bylaws to comply with the requirements of\n\nthis section until the time of its charter renewal under § 38-1802.12.”21 The third\n\nparagraph of subsection (c) states that “[n]othing in this subsection shall be\n\nconstrued as exempting the corporation from any other requirements of this\n\nsection.”22 Thus, while a pre-existing charter school such as Kamit is not required\n\nto amend its articles of incorporation or bylaws until its charter comes up for\n\nrenewal, it is subject to all the other requirements of § 38-1802.13a.\n\n\n\n\n      20\n           Id. § 38-1802.13a (c)(1).\n      21\n           Id. § 38-1802.13a (c)(2). Subsection (a) of § 38-1802.12 (“Charter\nrenewal”) provides that “[a] charter granted to a public charter school shall remain\nin force for a 15-year period” and “may be renewed for an unlimited number of\ntimes, each time for a 15-year period.”\n      22\n           Id. § 38-1802.13a (c)(3).\n\f                                          14\n\n      In its brief, Kamit suggests that § 38-1802.13a cannot be applied to it\n\nwithout violating the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution,23 but it has\n\narticulated no argument in support of that claim. In particular, Kamit has identified\n\nno obligation of the contract granting its charter (or of any other contract) that is\n\nimpaired by § 38-1802.13a.24 We therefore consider Kamit to have waived any\n\nclaim of a Contract Clause violation.25\n\n\n\n      Consequently, now that the revocation of Kamit’s charter is no longer\n\nsubject to legal challenge, Kamit must relinquish all control over its assets and\n\ncease its existence. The power to liquidate Kamit’s assets, discharge its debts, and\n\n      23\n         U.S. CONST. art. I, § 10, cl. 1 (“No State shall . . . pass any . . .

Kamit has no residual interest in\n\nany surplus; by law it all goes to the District.26 Kamit thus has no “legally\n\nprotected interest” in the escrowed funds at issue in this appeal—it cannot benefit\n\nby obtaining those funds, since the PCSB would dispose of them in any event, and\n\nit suffers no injury by being deprived of them. In other words, Kamit has nothing\n\nto gain by pursuing this appeal. It therefore lacks standing to do so, and the appeal\n\nmust be dismissed.\n\n\n\n                                                    So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n      26\n           In its response to appellees’ motion to dismiss its appeal, Kamit argued\nthat it retains an interest in funds it received from private (as opposed to public)\nsources. It is not clear why this should be so; the mandatory dissolution provisions\nof the SRA do not distinguish between privately and publicly contributed funds\nand leave it to the PCSB to determine whether any private donations must be\nreturned to the donors or redirected because the school closed. However, because\n(as Kamit’s counsel acknowledged at oral argument) there is no evidence in the\nrecord that Kamit actually possesses any segregated, privately contributed funds,\nany potential issue presented by the existence of such funds is not before us.\n\f</pre>",
