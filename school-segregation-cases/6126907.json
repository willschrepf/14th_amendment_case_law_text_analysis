The\n\fdistrict court1 granted VICC’s motion to dismiss. Having jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1291, this court affirms.\n\n                                          I.\n\n       E.L. is an African-American boy entering fifth grade. From kindergarten\nthrough third grade, he lived in the City of St. Louis, attending Gateway Science\nAcademy, a charter school there. During third grade, his family moved to St. Louis\nCounty, in the Pattonville School District. His mother asked Gateway to enroll him\nin fourth grade even though they no longer lived in the city limits. Gateway declined,\nproviding a copy of its policy that African-American students who live outside the\ncity are not eligible for enrollment.\n\n       E.L. sued, alleging equal protection violations. He did not name Gateway as\na defendant, but sued only VICC, a non-profit corporation created by a 1999\nsettlement agreement in the long-standing Liddell litigation. The federal lawsuit,\nfiled in 1972 by African-American parents, alleged St. Louis operated segregated\nschools in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. In 1983, a district court approved\na desegregation settlement agreement. See Liddell v. Board of Educ. of City of St.\nLouis, State of Mo., 567 F. Supp. 1037 (E.D. Mo. 1983), aff’d in part, rev’d in part,\n731 F.2d 1294 (8th Cir. 1984) (en banc). The agreement—funded by the defendants\n(the state of Missouri and the City Board of Education)—provided capital\nimprovements of city schools, establishment of city magnet schools, and a voluntary\ninterdistrict transfer plan. The transfer plan, at issue here, allowed African-American\nstudents living in the city to transfer to the county, and white students living in the\ncounty to transfer to the city.\n\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable Ronnie L. White, United States District Judge for the Eastern\nDistrict of Missouri.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f       In 1996, the state of Missouri moved for a declaration that St. Louis no longer\noperated a segregated, dual public school system. The court appointed a settlement\ncoordinator to negotiate a resolution. In 1999, the parties settled again. See Liddell\nv. Board of Educ. of City of St. Louis, 1999 WL 33314210, at *9 (E.D. Mo. Mar. 12,\n1999) (approving settlement agreement). The 1999 agreement established VICC to\nadminister the voluntary interdistrict transfer program, including: (1) arranging\ntransportation for students in the transfer program; (2) distributing funding to\nparticipating schools; and (3) disseminating information about eligibility\nrequirements (taken primarily from the 1983 agreement). The 1999 agreement\npermits only the sending and receiving districts to modify the eligibility requirements.\n\n      The district court granted VICC’s motion to dismiss on four alternative\ngrounds: (1) E.L. lacks standing; (2) he fails to state a claim; (3) the 1999 agreement\nprecludes his claims; and (4) the 1999 agreement releases VICC from liability. E.L.\nappeals.\n\n                                          II.\n\n       This court reviews “a decision dismissing a complaint for lack of standing de\nnovo, construing the allegations of the complaint, and the reasonable inferences\ndrawn therefrom, most favorably to the plaintiff.” Miller v. City of St. Paul, 823 F.3d\n503, 506 (8th Cir. 2016). “Article III standing is a threshold question in every federal\ncourt case.” United States v. One Lincoln Navigator 1998, 328 F.3d 1011, 1013 (8th\nCir. 2003). Standing requires three elements: (1) “injury in fact”; (2) “a causal\nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of”; and (3) the likelihood\n“that the injury will be ‘redressed by a favorable decision.’” Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992), quoting Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights\nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 38 (1976).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f                                           A.\n\n       An injury in fact requires that a plaintiff demonstrate he or she is “able and\nready” to apply for an educational opportunity and “a discriminatory policy prevents\n[them] from doing so on an equal basis.” Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 262\n(2003), quoting Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v.\nJacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993). “It is well established that intent may be\nrelevant to standing in an equal protection challenge.” Id. at 261. Under Gratz,\nindividuals must show that they intend to apply to a school in order to have standing\nto challenge a discriminatory admissions policy. See id. at 260-61. See also Shea v.\nKerry, 796 F.3d 42, 50 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“Gratz controls our inquiry. Like [the Gratz\nplaintiff], [the plaintiff here] alleges that he possessed an intent to apply to the\nposition in question.”); Carroll v. Nakatani, 342 F.3d 934, 942 (9th Cir. 2003)\n(applying Gratz to require “a legitimate intention to apply”).\n\n       E.L. claims two injuries in fact by denials of the opportunity to attend Gateway\nand city magnet schools. The first—denial of the opportunity to attend Gateway—is\nan injury in fact. E.L. attended there for four years while living in the city. See §\n160.410.1(1) RSMo (requiring charter schools to enroll “[a]ll pupils resident in the\ndistrict in which it operates”). The complaint alleges that after moving to the county,\nhe sought to continue his enrollment, but was denied. He is thus “able and ready” to\nenroll, but prohibited from doing so by an allegedly “discriminatory policy.” Gratz,\n539 U.S. at 262.\n\n       The second—denial of the opportunity to attend city magnet schools—is not\nan injury in fact. While the complaint references magnet schools and VICC’s transfer\npolicy for them, it does not allege E.L. is interested in enrolling. To the contrary, his\ncomplaint suggests that he is interested in attending only Gateway. His motion for\na preliminary injunction confirms this, seeking “to permit E.L. to continue his\nacademic success at Gateway.” Citing Gratz, E.L. argues that whether he “‘actually\n\n                                          -4-\n\fapplied’ for admission as a transfer student [to a magnet school] is not determinative\nof his ability to seek injunctive relief in this case.” See id. at 260-61. This court\nagrees. However, he must still show some “intent to apply.” Id. at 261. The\nmention of magnet schools and the generalized grievance about VICC’s transfer\npolicy for them is insufficient to allege an injury in fact.\n\n                                           B.\n\n       “[T]here must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct\ncomplained of—the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the\ndefendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before\nthe court.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (alterations incorporated) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). “When the injury alleged is the result of actions by some third party,\nnot the defendant, the plaintiff cannot satisfy the causation element of the standing\ninquiry.” Miller v. Redwood Toxicology Lab., Inc., 688 F.3d 928, 935 (8th Cir.\n2012).\n\n      E.L.’s complaint alleges VICC denied him the opportunity to attend Gateway\non an equal basis.2 This allegation is insufficient to confer standing because it\nerroneously assumes VICC’s policy, not Gateway’s, was the reason he was denied\nadmission. Throughout briefing and argument, E.L. states: “Because VICC’s transfer\npolicy is the only one that discriminates on the basis of race, it logically follows that\nVICC’s policy causes E.L.’s injury—unequal treatment on the basis of race.” But\nGateway’s policy also differentiates based on race: “If address is not found on the\n\n\n      2\n       E.L.’s brief states: “Gateway administrators told La’Shieka that VICC’s\ntransfer policy prevented E.L. from attending the school because of his race.” This\nstatement is not supported by the complaint. It states only that he was denied\nadmission “because of his race” and “Gateway officials gave La’Shieka a handout\nexplaining the enrollment requirements.”\n\n                                          -5-\n\fcity site or the zip code is not listed above and the student identifies as African-\nAmerican, you cannot enroll the student.” And Gateway provided a copy of this\npolicy, not VICC’s, to support the denial of admission. VICC’s policy—which was\nnever cited by Gateway as a reason for denying admission—does not apply to charter\nschools, which are “independent public school[s],” governed by statute. See §§\n160.400-160.425 RSMo. Thus, VICC has no administrative or supervisory authority\nover them.\n\n       Still, E.L. argues VICC caused his injury because state law requires charter\nschools to enroll any student eligible to transfer under the voluntary transfer program.\nSee § 160.410.1(2) RSMo (requiring charter schools to enroll “Nonresident pupils\neligible to attend a district’s school under an urban voluntary transfer program.”).\nStated differently, E.L. thinks § 160.410.1(2) legally imposes VICC’s policy on\ncharter schools. See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 168-70 (1997).\n\n         Even if VICC’s policy applies to charter schools under § 160.410.1(2), VICC\nstill would not cause E.L.’s injury. VICC does not make or adopt rules or regulations\nfor charter schools; Gateway and the state of Missouri do. The state of Missouri tells\nGateway it must admit “[n]onresident pupils eligible to attend a district’s school\nunder an urban voluntary transfer program.” § 160.410.1(2) RSMo. Assuming §\n160.410.1(2) incorporates VICC’s policy into state law governing charter schools, the\nstate of Missouri, not VICC, causes the injury. See Miller, 688 F.3d at 935-36\n(holding plaintiff lacked standing to sue a toxicology lab for “erroneous probation\nviolation reports” because the State of Minnesota, not the lab, caused the injury\nbecause it “chose the particular test, ultimately established and implemented the\ncut-off levels for the probationers it tested, and interpreted the test results”).\nSimilarly, Gateway, not VICC, decided to follow § 160.410.1(2) rather than §\n160.410.3, which prohibits charter schools from limiting admission based on race.\nSee RSMo § 160.410.3 (“A charter school shall not limit admission based on race\n. . . .”). And Gateway, not VICC, denied E.L. admission. E.L.’s argument—that\n\n                                          -6-\n\fVICC’s transfer policy, by operation of § 160.410.1(2), prevents charter schools from\nenrolling African-American county residents—is without merit. See Bennett, 520\nU.S. at 168-69 (holding that where the injury complained of results from the\n“independent action of some third party not before the court,” standing can still exist,\nbut only if the injury is “produced by determinative or coercive effect” of the party\nsued).\n\n     E.L.’s alleged injury is not “fairly traceable” to VICC. Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n560-61.\n\n                                  *******\n      E.L. lacks standing. The judgment is affirmed.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f",

The first—denial of the opportunity to attend Gateway—is\nan injury in fact. E.L. attended there for four years while living in the city. See §\n160.410.1(1) RSMo (requiring charter schools to enroll “[a]ll pupils resident in the\ndistrict in which it operates”). The complaint alleges that after moving to the county,\nhe sought to continue his enrollment, but was denied. He is thus “able and ready” to\nenroll, but prohibited from doing so by an allegedly “discriminatory policy.” Gratz,\n539 U.S. at 262.\n\n       The second—denial of the opportunity to attend city magnet schools—is not\nan injury in fact. While the complaint references magnet schools and VICC’s transfer\npolicy for them, it does not allege E.L. is interested in enrolling. To the contrary, his\ncomplaint suggests that he is interested in attending only Gateway. His motion for\na preliminary injunction confirms this, seeking “to permit E.L. to continue his\nacademic success at Gateway.” Citing Gratz, E.L. argues that whether he “‘actually\n\n                                          -4-\n\fapplied’ for admission as a transfer student [to a magnet school] is not determinative\nof his ability to seek injunctive relief in this case.” See id. at 260-61. This court\nagrees. However, he must still show some “intent to apply.” Id. at 261. The\nmention of magnet schools and the generalized grievance about VICC’s transfer\npolicy for them is insufficient to allege an injury in fact.\n\n                                           B.\n\n       “[T]here must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct\ncomplained of—the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the\ndefendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before\nthe court.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (alterations incorporated) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). “When the injury alleged is the result of actions by some third party,\nnot the defendant, the plaintiff cannot satisfy the causation element of the standing\ninquiry.” Miller v. Redwood Toxicology Lab., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 935 (8th Cir.\n2012).\n\n      E.L.’s complaint alleges VICC denied him the opportunity to attend Gateway\non an equal basis.2 This allegation is insufficient to confer standing because it\nerroneously assumes VICC’s policy, not Gateway’s, was the reason he was denied\nadmission. Throughout briefing and argument, E.L. states: “Because VICC’s transfer\npolicy is the only one that discriminates on the basis of race, it logically follows that\nVICC’s policy causes E.L.’s injury—unequal treatment on the basis of race.” But\nGateway’s policy also differentiates based on race: “If address is not found on the\n\n\n      2\n       E.L.’s brief states: “Gateway administrators told La’Shieka that VICC’s\ntransfer policy prevented E.L. from attending the school because of his race.” This\nstatement is not supported by the complaint. It states only that he was denied\nadmission “because of his race” and “Gateway officials gave La’Shieka a handout\nexplaining the enrollment requirements.”\n\n                                          -5-\n\fcity site or the zip code is not listed above and the student identifies as African-\nAmerican, you cannot enroll the student.” And Gateway provided a copy of this\npolicy, not VICC’s, to support the denial of admission. VICC’s policy—which was\nnever cited by Gateway as a reason for denying admission—does not apply to charter\nschools, which are “independent public school[s],” governed by statute. See §§\n160.400-160.425 RSMo. Thus, VICC has no administrative or supervisory authority\nover them.\n\n       Still, E.L. argues VICC caused his injury because state law requires charter\nschools to enroll any student eligible to transfer under the voluntary transfer program.\nSee § 160.410.1(2) RSMo (requiring charter schools to enroll “Nonresident pupils\neligible to attend a district’s school under an urban voluntary transfer program.”).\nStated differently, E.L. thinks § 160.410.1(2) legally imposes VICC’s policy on\ncharter schools. See Bennett v. Spear, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118096\"><a href=\"/opinion/118096/bennett-v-spear/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168-70 (1997).\n\n         Even if VICC’s policy applies to charter schools under § 160.410.1(2), VICC\nstill would not cause E.L.’s injury. VICC does not make or adopt rules or regulations\nfor charter schools; Gateway and the state of Missouri do. The state of Missouri tells\nGateway it must admit “[n]onresident pupils eligible to attend a district’s school\nunder an urban voluntary transfer program.” § 160.410.1(2) RSMo. Assuming §\n160.410.1(2) incorporates VICC’s policy into state law governing charter schools, the\nstate of Missouri, not VICC, causes the injury. See Miller, 688 F.3d at 935-36\n(holding plaintiff lacked standing to sue a toxicology lab for “erroneous probation\nviolation reports” because the State of Minnesota, not the lab, caused the injury\nbecause it “chose the particular test, ultimately established and implemented the\ncut-off levels for the probationers it tested, and interpreted the test results”).\nSimilarly, Gateway, not VICC, decided to follow § 160.410.1(2) rather than §\n160.410.3, which prohibits charter schools from limiting admission based on race.\nSee RSMo § 160.410.3 (“A charter school shall not limit admission based on race\n. . . .”). And Gateway, not VICC, denied E.L. admission. E.L.’s argument—that\n\n                                          -6-\n\fVICC’s transfer policy, by operation of § 160.410.1(2), prevents charter schools from\nenrolling African-American county residents—is without merit. See Bennett, 520\nU.S. at 168-69 (holding that where the injury complained of results from the\n“independent action of some third party not before the court,” standing can still exist,\nbut only if the injury is “produced by determinative or coercive effect” of the party\nsued).\n\n     E.L.’s alleged injury is not “fairly traceable” to VICC. Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n560-61.\n\n                                  *******\n      E.L. lacks standing. The judgment is affirmed.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f</pre>",
