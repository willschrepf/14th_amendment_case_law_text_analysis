(Super. Ct. No. SCS272077)\n\nESTEBAN JIMENEZ,\n\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL from a postjudgment order of the Superior Court of San Diego County,\n\nDavid J. Danielsen, Judge. Affirmed.\n\n         Kevin D. Sheehy, under appointment by the Court of Appeal, for Defendant and\n\nAppellant.\n\n         Kamala D. Harris, Attorney General, Gerald A. Engler, Chief Assistant Attorney\n\nGeneral, Julie L. Garland, Assistant Attorney General, Charles C. Ragland, Scott C.\n\nTaylor and Paige B. Hazard, Deputy Attorneys General, for Plaintiff and Respondent.\n\n         On November 4, 2014, the voters enacted Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods\n\nand Schools Act (the Act), which went into effect the next day. (Cal. Const., art. II, § 10,\n\fsubd. (a).) In this case, we are asked to interpret a portion of Penal Code1 section\n\n1170.18, a new sentencing provision created by the Act.\n\n       Under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), \"[a] person currently serving a sentence\n\nfor a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been\n\nguilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section had this act been in effect at\n\nthe time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that\n\nentered the judgment of conviction in his or her case\" and request resentencing. Here,\n\nEsteban Jimenez filed a motion to be resentenced under section 1170.18, subdivision (a).\n\nThere is no dispute that Jimenez satisfies the criteria under that subdivision. However,\n\nthe superior court declined to resentence Jimenez because it determined that Jimenez\n\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See § 1170.18, subd. (b).)\n\nJimenez challenges that determination.\n\n       Jimenez contends the superior court misconstrued the unreasonable risk of danger\n\nto public safety \"test\" and that, considering the correct interpretation of that test,\n\nJimenez's circumstances do not support any determination that he would be an\n\nunreasonable risk to public safety under section 1170.18, subdivision (b). In the\n\nalternative, Jimenez maintains that section 1170, subdivision (b) is unconstitutionally\n\nvague and violates his federal due process rights.\n\n       Jimenez's contentions present an issue of first impression. Neither party has cited\n\nany authority that has interpreted section 1170, subdivision (b). Our independent\n\n\n\n1      Statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.\n                                               2\n\fresearch has not found any as well. We are aware that multiple cases involving the Act\n\nare currently pending before our high court. However, none of these cases involve the\n\nprecise issue before us, but it is possible that those cases could impact the instant matter\n\nin some way. We thus proceed cautiously with this case and look forward to the\n\nSupreme Court's guidance on the Act in the near future.\n\n          We determine that there is no merit to Jimenez's challenge to the Act. We\n\nconclude the superior court properly applied section 1170.18, subdivision (b) to Jimenez\n\nand did not abuse its discretion in finding that he was not eligible for resentencing\n\nbecause he was an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Likewise, Jimenez's\n\nconstitutional attack on the Act fares no better. The language the voters approved in\n\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (b), namely the unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\n\nis similar to language in other statutes and has been used in a variety of circumstances\n\nunder California law. We therefore determine that section 1170.18, subdivision (b) is not\n\nunconstitutionally vague and Jimenez's due process challenge fails. Accordingly, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n          On May 9, 2014, police officers recognized Jimenez in the passenger seat of his\n\ngirlfriend's car and conducted a stop because they knew a warrant had been issued for his\n\narrest due to a parole violation. The occupants were ordered to place their hands outside\n\nthe car, but twice Jimenez pulled his hands back into the car. An officer observed\n\nJimenez throw three small bindles of marijuana, methamphetamine, and heroin out of the\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fwindow. Jimenez's girlfriend was in the driver's seat and her three-year-old son was in\n\nthe back seat of the car.\n\n       On May 14, 2014, the San Diego County District Attorney's Office charged\n\nJimenez with two counts of possession of a controlled substance (Health & Saf. Code,\n\n§§ 11350, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a)). It was further alleged that he had one prior strike\n\nconviction (§§ 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, 668), three prison priors (§§ 667.5, subd. (b),\n\n668), and four probation denial prior felony convictions (§ 1203, subd. (e)(4)).\n\n       On July 25, 2014, Jimenez pled guilty to both counts and admitted all prior\n\nconviction allegations.\n\n       On August 21, 2014, Jimenez was sentenced to 32 months in prison. The sentence\n\nincluded a concurrent low term of 16 months for each count, doubled due to the prior\n\nstrike conviction. The court struck the other prior allegations for purposes of sentencing.\n\n       On November 17, 2014, Jimenez filed a petition for recall of sentence under the\n\nAct. In support of his petition, Jimenez presented evidence of the education program he\n\ncompleted and a letter of support from his fiancé, explaining that Jimenez is needed at\n\nhome to help raise their children. The petition stated Jimenez had been employed in\n\nprison, was motivated to take care of his family, and had not sustained a parole violation\n\nsince July 15, 2011.\n\n       In opposition to the petition, the People agreed that Jimenez was eligible for relief\n\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (i)), but argued that he posed an unreasonable risk of committing one of\n\nthe enumerated \"super strikes\" (§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv)). Specifically, the People\n\nargued that he would commit attempted murder. In support of their argument, the\n\n                                             4\n\fPeople described Jimenez as a \"gangster\" whose history \"is replete with ties to his gang,\n\nthe use and possession of weapons, and bloodshed.\"\n\n       The People also emphasized Jimenez's criminal history. Jimenez had a strike\n\nconviction for assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)), which stemmed from a\n\nFebruary 5, 2012, incident when Jimenez approached a stranger and \"stabbed the victim\n\nin the abdomen for no apparent reason.\" The wound was an inch deep and spanned two\n\nto three inches of the victim's torso. When the victim attempted to defend himself, two of\n\nJimenez's fellow gang members attacked the victim while yelling their gang's name, \"Old\n\nTown National City.\" As a result, Jimenez was charged with attempted murder (§§ 187,\n\nsubd. (a), 664) and assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)). It was alleged he\n\ncommitted the crimes to benefit his gang (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)), and that the crimes\n\nwere serious felonies (§ 1192.7, subds. (c)(8) & (c)(23)). Ultimately, Jimenez pled guilty\n\nto assault with a deadly weapon and the serious felony allegation (§ 1192.7, subd.\n\n(c)(23)), and was sentenced to four years in prison. He later violated the terms of his\n\nparole in that case.\n\n       The People also presented evidence that Jimenez had an extensive adult criminal\n\nhistory leading up to the strike offense: a prison prior in 2009 (§ 4502, subd. (b)),\n\nmanufacture of a dirk or dagger in prison (after two prisoners attacked a third inmate by\n\nstabbing him 16 times, Jimenez recovered the weapon, ran to the bathroom and flushed\n\nit); another prison prior in 2009 (§ 12022, subd. (a)(1)), possession of brass knuckles\n\n(police conducting a probation compliance search saw Jimenez throw a loaded syringe\n\nonto the floor and crawl out the bedroom window while in possession of brass knuckles);\n\n                                              5\n\fpossession of ammunition by a prohibited person in 2006 (§ 12316, subd. (b)(1));\n\ncontempt of court in 2006 (§ 166, subd. (a)(4); Jimenez was found with two other\n\ndocumented gang members and thus found in violation of a court-ordered gang\n\ninjunction); a prison prior in 2005 (Veh. Code, § 10851, subd. (a), taking a vehicle\n\nwithout consent (Jimenez was found driving a stolen truck)); possession of a controlled\n\nsubstance in 2005 (Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)); possession of less than an\n\nounce of marijuana in 2004 (Health & Saf. Code, § 11357, subd. (b)).\n\n       The People also noted that Jimenez violated probation or parole in every case in\n\nwhich he was placed under supervision. For his 2005 prison prior, Jimenez's probation\n\nwas revoked six times before he was placed on parole in 2007, and he violated the terms\n\nof his parole in 2009. He violated parole on his 2009 convictions as late as September\n\n2011 and violated parole on his strike conviction in May 2014.\n\n       The People maintained Jimenez had a violent adult record while in prison. Aside\n\nfrom the 2009 incident involving him disposing of a slashing weapon after an attack on\n\nan inmate, Jimenez was administratively disciplined in 2008 for physically attacking\n\nanother inmate. Four months earlier, Jimenez was disciplined after attacking an inmate\n\non the basketball court. Finally, in September 2007, Jimenez was placed in\n\nadministrative segregation after attacking an inmate because the disciplinary committee\n\nconcluded that \" 'release to the general population at this time would jeopardize the safety\n\nand security of the institution.' \"\n\n       Jimenez's criminal behavior began as a juvenile. In February 2002, as a teenager,\n\na true finding was made that Jimenez committed vandalism (§ 594, subds. (a) &\n\n                                             6\n\f(b)(2)(A)) after he tagged his gang's name and moniker on a park wall. In May 2002, a\n\ntrue finding was made that he committed second degree burglary (§ 459). In October\n\n2001, Jimenez brandished a metal pipe at a man and threatened to strike the victim if he\n\ndid not give him his wallet. Though Jimenez did not strike the victim with the pipe, the\n\nvictim was punched in the face (by either Jimenez or the juvenile with him). As a result,\n\nJimenez was convicted of attempted robbery and sentenced to various terms including\n\ngang conditions.\n\n       The People asserted that Jimenez's violent behavior as a teenager continued when\n\nin custody. For example, in 2002, he was disciplined several times: fighting (May, July\n\nand Aug. 2002), gang-related fighting (May and Oct. 2002), and killing a bird (Aug.\n\n2002). Jimenez claimed to have joined the Old Town National City gang at age 10. He\n\nalso started drinking alcohol at that time. He began using marijuana a year later.\n\n       Additionally, the People highlighted criminal activity that did not result in a\n\nconviction. In 2005 when on parole, Jimenez jumped from a car after it was pursued and\n\nran from police. Also in 2005, Jimenez was stopped by officers while riding a bicycle\n\nand admitted smoking methamphetamine that day. In 2002, officers stopped a car after a\n\nbottle was thrown from the car at a passing motorist. Sixteen-year-old Jimenez was in\n\nthe car and so intoxicated he could not walk without assistance.\n\n       The court held a hearing on Jimenez's petition. At the hearing, Jimenez's attorney\n\nattempted to minimize Jimenez's previous criminal activity, arguing that Jimenez was not\n\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       At the hearing, the superior court considered Jimenez's petition, the People's\n\nopposition, the defense's brief in support of the petition, and the probation officer's report\n\nprepared for the original sentencing. Noting the high standard set for any court to\n\ndisqualify a person from the Act's benefits, the court explained it was the People's burden\n\nto prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Jimenez posed an unreasonable risk.\n\nThe court defined an unreasonable risk as a \"demonstrated [] substantial danger, a serious\n\nand well-founded risk, that the individual will commit super strike crimes\" if released.\n\nThe court explained that a chance or mere possibility that Jimenez would commit an\n\nenumerated offense would not satisfy the standard.\n\n       The court ultimately denied the petition as follows:\n\n          \"Mr. Jimenez is an individual who has yet to enjoy his 30th birthday\n          that's coming up shortly. In his short life, commencing as a juvenile,\n          he has shown a propensity for persistent criminality. Consistent with\n          that criminality there is also a consistent or persistent use of force\n          with violence that is characteristic of his interactions when free in\n          the community, and ironically it does not seem to be abated by\n          incarceration. In fact, it is more pronounced as being his means of\n          expressing himself. [¶] In addition to the persistent criminality and\n          persistent use of violence, there are two significant events in his life\n          that this court deems to be extremely important. One was he did\n          utilize a knife on another human being resulting in serious injuries\n          for which he was convicted. In addition, during his time in the\n          institution, he participated in a stabbing incident. It is noted that his\n          participation is somewhat limited, but he did participate, took the\n          stabbing instrument attempting to dispose of it to protect those that\n          were utilizing it. [¶] On balance, Mr. Jimenez is an individual that\n          this court is convinced that he is likely to engage in violence with a\n          weapon if free in the community. The court deems his record, as I\n          review it in totality, as one which does present a substantial danger\n          and serious well-founded risk that he would likely commit a super\n          strike if free in the community. That risk of danger is unreasonable\n          under the circumstances and the petition accordingly is denied.\"\n\n\n                                              8\n\f       Jimenez timely appealed.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n       \"Proposition 47 'was intended to reduce penalties \"for certain nonserious and\n\nnonviolent property and drug offenses from wobblers or felonies to misdemeanors.\" ' \"\n\n(T.W. v. Superior Court (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 646, 652.) \" 'In interpreting a voter\n\ninitiative . . . we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction. [Citation.]\n\nThus, \"we turn first to the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary\n\nmeaning.\" [Citation.] The statutory language must also be construed in the context of\n\nthe statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme [in light of the electorate's intent].\n\n[Citation.] When the language is ambiguous, \"we refer to other indicia of the voters'\n\nintent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.\"\n\n[Citation.]' [Citation.] In other words, 'our primary purpose is to ascertain and effectuate\n\nthe intent of the voters who passed the initiative measure.' \" (People v. Briceno (2004) 34\n\nCal.4th 451, 459.)\n\n       As established by the Act, section 1170.18 created a procedure by which eligible\n\ndefendants currently serving felony sentences for certain drug possession and theft\n\noffenses may petition to recall their sentences and seek resentencing to reduce those\n\noffenses to misdemeanors. \"Under section 1170.18, a person 'currently serving' a felony\n\nsentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor under Proposition 47, may petition for\n\na recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the statutes that\n\nwere added or amended by Proposition 47. [Citation.] A person who satisfies the criteria\n\nin section 1170.18 shall have his or her sentence recalled and be 'resentenced to a\n\n                                              9\n\fmisdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the\n\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.' [Citation.]\n\nSubdivision (c) of section 1170.18 defines the term 'unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety,' and subdivision (b) of the statute lists factors the court must consider in\n\ndetermining 'whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to\n\npublic safety.' \" (People v. Rivera (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1085, 1092.)\n\n       Here, there is no dispute that Jimenez pled guilty to felonies that would qualify to\n\nbe resentenced as misdemeanors under section 1170.18, subdivision (a). As such, we\n\nneed not interpret that subdivision. Instead, we focus on subdivisions (b) and (c).\n\n       Section 1170.18, subdivision (b) sets forth the criteria for the superior court to\n\nconsider, in its discretion, to determine whether a petitioner is an unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety. The factors are as follows:\n\n           \"(1) The petitioner's criminal conviction history, including the type\n           of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of\n           prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes.\n\n           \"(2) The petitioner's disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation\n           while incarcerated.\n\n           \"(3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines\n           to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an\n           unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\" (§ 1170.18, subd.\n           (b)(1)-(3).)\n\n       In addition, section 1170.18, subdivision (c) further defines \"unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety\" as \"an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new\"\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fsuper strike offense, such as murder, rape, or child molestation. (§§ 1170.18, subd. (c);\n\n667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv).)2\n\n       Here, Jimenez contends the superior court erred in two ways. First, he asserts the\n\ncourt misconstrued the unreasonable risk test found in section 1170.18, subdivision (b),\n\nand as such, applied the wrong test. Specifically, he claims the court applied a test based\n\non \"an unrelated statutory standard applicable only to sexually violent predators.\"\n\nSecond, Jimenez maintains that his circumstances do not support that he is an\n\nunreasonable risk under the correct test. We reject both of these contentions.\n\n       As a threshold matter, we note that the plain language of section 1170.18,\n\nsubdivision (b) calls for an exercise of the sentencing court's discretion. \" 'Discretion is\n\nthe power to make the decision, one way or the other.' \" (People v. Carmony (2004) 33\n\n\n\n2      Section 1170.18, subdivision (c) provides: \" '[U]nreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety' means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent\nfelony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (e) of Section 667.\"\n       Section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv), in turn, lists the following super-strike\noffenses: \"(I) A 'sexually violent offense' as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 6600 of\nthe Welfare and Institutions Code.

Carmony,\n\nsupra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 377.) \"An abuse of discretion is shown when the trial court\n\napplies the wrong legal standard.\" (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court (2009) 47\n\nCal.4th 725, 733.)\n\n                                              12\n\f       Here, Jimenez argues the superior court abused its discretion when it applied the\n\nwrong legal standard, namely the standard used to determine if a defendant is a sexually\n\nviolent predator. To this end, Jimenez focuses on specific words the superior court used\n\nin explaining its determination that Jimenez would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\n\npublic safety if resentenced. For example, in considering Jimenez's petition under the\n\nAct, the superior court explained: \"In my judgment, the type of risk that is an\n\nunreasonable risk can only be presented to the court when there is demonstrated a\n\nsubstantial danger, a serious and well-founded risk, that the individual will commit super\n\nstrike crimes if free in the community.\" Jimenez points out that appellate courts,\n\nincluding our Supreme Court, have used the terms \"substantial danger\" and \"serious and\n\nwell-founded risk\" in construing portions of the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA,\n\nWelf. & Inst. Code, § 6600 et seq.). He is correct. (See People v. Superior Court\n\n(Ghilotti) (2002) 27 Cal.4th 888, 922 (Ghilotti).) Nevertheless, the fact that the superior\n\ncourt used such language is not of the moment.\n\n       In Ghilotti, our high court interpreted the phrase \"likely to engage in acts of sexual\n\nviolence\" as used in Welfare and Institutions Code section 6601, subdivision (d). In\n\ndoing so, the court found that phrase \"connotes much more than the mere possibility that\n\nthe person will reoffend as a result of a predisposing mental disorder that seriously\n\nimpairs volitional control. On the other hand, the statute does not require a precise\n\ndetermination that the chance of reoffense is better than even. Instead, an evaluator\n\napplying this standard must conclude that the person is 'likely' to reoffend if, because of a\n\ncurrent mental disorder which makes it difficult or impossible to restrain violent sexual\n\n                                             13\n\fbehavior, the person presents a substantial danger, that is, a serious and well-founded\n\nrisk, that he or she will commit such crimes if free in the community.\" (Ghilotti, supra,\n\n27 Cal.4th at p. 922, original italics.) Also, the court made clear that it was not persuaded\n\n\"that a valid involuntary commitment law requires proof that the person is more likely\n\nthan not to reoffend.\" (Id. at p. 923, original italics.)\n\n       Jimenez contends the superior court's use of the SVPA to interpret unreasonable\n\nrisk of danger to public safety under the Act was improper for two reasons. First,\n\nJimenez emphasizes the purpose of the SVPA is to \"fill up state institutional spaces (i.e.,\n\nstate hospitals) with certain identified violent sex offenders\" while, in contrast, the Act's\n\npurpose is to \"free up state institutional spaces . . . now occupied by nonserious,\n\nnonviolent felons who should be treated as misdemeanants and released sooner rather\n\nthan later from incarceration.\" Although we do not quibble with Jimenez's description of\n\nthe Act's purpose (see T.W. v. Superior Court, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th 646, 652), the\n\nportion of the Act at issue, section 1170.18, subdivision (b), provides the court with the\n\ndiscretion to conclude that a petitioner, who otherwise qualifies to have his sentence\n\nreduced under the Act, should not be released earlier because he or she would pose an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See §1170.18, subd. (b).) In other words,\n\nthe portion of the Act Jimenez challenges here, much like Welfare and Institutions Code\n\nsection 6601, subdivision (d), provides a standard by which a court must evaluate a\n\ndefendant to determine if he or she poses a certain type of danger to society. As such, we\n\nare not troubled that the superior court invoked the terms \"substantial danger\" and\n\n\"serious and well-founded risk\" in denying Jimenez's petition under the Act.\n\n                                               14\n\f       Second, Jimenez maintains that by using the SVPA as a guide to interpret section\n\n1170.18, subdivision (b)'s \"unreasonable risk\" language, the court \"set[] a significantly\n\nlower bar . . . to exclude a large group of eligible people from the benefits of\n\nmisdemeanor resentencing than the Act intends.\" To this end, Jimenez asserts that\n\n\"unreasonable\" means, in \"everyday usage,\" \"excessive\" or \"immoderate.\" Armed with\n\nthis definition, Jimenez concludes, \"[c]ommonsensically, a risk that something is less\n\nlikely to occur than not cannot be called an excessive or immoderate risk by any stretch\n\nof the imagination.\" Essentially, Jimenez argues that the phrase \"unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety,\" as used in section 1170.18, subdivision (b), requires a court to\n\nfind that a petitioner is more likely than not to commit a super strike if released early.\n\nWe find no support for this urged interpretation.\n\n       The Act does not create the phrase \"unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\"\n\nout of whole cloth. This same phrase can be found in section 1170.126, subdivision (f) as\n\nadded by the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012. That subdivision gives a court\n\ndiscretion to deny a petition for resentencing under the Three Strikes Reform Act if the\n\ncourt \"determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety.\" (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).)\n\n       We observe \"it has long been settled that '[t]he enacting body is deemed to be\n\naware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is\n\nenacted' [citation], 'and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof' [citation].\n\n'This principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative.' \" (People v. Superior Court\n\n(Cervantes) (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1007, 1015; accord, In re Lance W. (1985) 37 Cal.3d\n\n                                              15\n\f873, 890, fn. 11.) Thus, we presume voters were aware \"unreasonable risk of danger to\n\npublic safety,\" as used in section 1170.126, subdivision (f), had been judicially construed\n\nas not being impermissibly vague, but as nevertheless having no fixed definition.3 (See\n\nPeople v. Garcia (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 763, 769-770 (Garcia); People v. Flores (2014)\n\n227 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1075 (Flores).)\n\n       As such, if the drafters had intended to require a court to find that a petitioner was\n\nmore likely than not to commit a super strike to be found to be an unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety, they could have written the Act as such. They did not. We\n\ncannot read into a statute qualifications or modifications that will materially affect its\n\noperation as to conform to a supposed intention not expressed by the voters. (See Taylor\n\nv. McKay (1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 644, 651-652; Ogle v. Heim (1968) 69 Cal.2d 7, 9.)\n\n       The Act's provision that allows a court to determine if a petitioner presents an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger is nothing new in California law. (See In re Shaputis, supra,\n\n53 Cal.4th at p. 219; Garcia, supra, 230 Cal.App.4th at pp. 769-770; Flores, supra, 227\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1075.) The Act merely asks the court to make a dangerousness\n\ndetermination. A dangerousness determination is a factual inquiry guided by a superior\n\ncourt's review of certain enumerated criteria. Under the Act, the court must determine\n\n\n\n3       In addition, similar language is found elsewhere in California law. For example,\nin reviewing a decision by the California Board of Parole to deny a prisoner parole, an\nappellate court considers only \"whether some evidence supports the ultimate conclusion\nthat the inmate poses an unreasonable risk to public safety if released.\" (In re Shaputis\n(2011) 53 Cal.4th 192, 219.) Jimenez has not provided us with any authority wherein the\nunreasonable risk within the parole context requires a more likely than not finding of\ndangerousness. Our independent research has not uncovered any either.\n                                              16\n\fwhether an unreasonable risk exists that the petitioner will commit a new super strike\n\noffense, such as murder, rape, or child molestation, if he is released from prison early.\n\n(§ 1170.18, subds. (b), (c).) Further, the Act specifically tells the court what factors to\n\nconsider. (See § 1170.18, subd. (b).) There is no indication in the record, and Jimenez\n\nhas not persuaded us otherwise, that the superior court did not consider the appropriate\n\nfactors. And the fact that the court, here, in making the dangerousness determination,\n\nsaid certain words that have been used in the SVPA context does not mean that it applied\n\nthe wrong test.\n\n       Having concluded that the superior court did not apply the wrong test, we next\n\nanalyze whether the court abused its discretion in finding Jimenez was not eligible for\n\nresentencing under the Act because he posed an unreasonable risk of danger. We\n\nconclude the court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n       Jimenez possesses a long criminal history marked with violence. He joined a\n\ncriminal street gang at age 10. He, while armed with a metal pipe, attempted to rob a\n\nperson. He stabbed a person in the stomach with a knife, was charged with attempted\n\nmurder, and ultimately pled guilty to assault with a deadly weapon, serving four years in\n\nprison. During his prison sentence, Jimenez flushed a stabbing weapon down the toilet\n\nthat had been used to stab another inmate 16 times.\n\n       While incarcerated, Jimenez has a history of physical violence, including three\n\nattacks on other inmates. Even as a juvenile, Jimenez's time in custody was littered with\n\nvarious acts of physical violence, such as fighting and killing a bird.\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f       Despite multiple instances of physical violence, Jimenez nevertheless maintains\n\nthat the superior court's finding that he was an unreasonable risk to commit a super strike\n\nconstituted an abuse of discretion because he has never been convicted of a specific intent\n\ncrime. However, there is no such required finding under the Act. Instead, section\n\n1170.18, subdivision (b) tasks the superior court with determining whether a petitioner is\n\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety by considering the petitioner's criminal\n\nhistory, disciplinary record while incarcerated, and any other relevant evidence.\n\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (b).) There is nothing that requires a petitioner to have been convicted\n\nof or pled guilty to a specific intent crime.\n\n       In short, we are satisfied that the superior court's finding that resentencing Jimenez\n\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety was not arbitrary, irrational,\n\nor capricious. The court therefore did not abuse its discretion.\n\n       Jimenez next challenges the Act on constitutional grounds. He insists that section\n\n1170.18, subdivision (b), specifically the phrase \"unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety\" is unconstitutionally vague, and thus, violates his federal due process rights. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n       \"The constitutional interest implicated in questions of statutory vagueness is that\n\nno person be deprived of 'life, liberty, or property without due process of law,' as assured\n\nby both the federal Constitution [citation] and the California Constitution [citation].)\"\n\n(Williams v. Garcetti (1993) 5 Cal.4th 561, 567.) The government violates this guarantee\n\nby taking away someone's life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it\n\nfails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that\n\n                                                18\n\fit invites arbitrary enforcement. (Kolender v. Lawson (1983) 461 U.S. 352, 357-358.)\n\n\"All presumptions and intendments favor the validity of a statute and mere doubt does\n\nnot afford sufficient reason for a judicial declaration of invalidity. Statutes must be\n\nupheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively and unmistakably appears.\"\n\n(Lockheed Aircraft Corp. v. Superior Court (1946) 28 Cal.2d 481, 484.)\n\n       No appellate court in California has addressed the constitutionality of section\n\n1170.18, subdivision (b). However, there are two reported cases wherein an appellant\n\nchallenged analogous language found in the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012. In\n\nGarcia, supra, 230 Cal.App.4th 763, the appellant contended that section 1170.126 was\n\nunconstitutionally vague because the term \"unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\"\n\nwas not defined. (Garcia, supra, at p. 768.) In finding that the term was not\n\nunconstitutionally vague, the court noted that the meaning of \"unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety\" is made clear by reference to examples of evidence the superior\n\ncourt could consider in making the determination. (Id. at p. 769.) The criteria set forth in\n\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f) is identical to that found in section 1170.18.,\n\nsubdivision (b). (See §§ 1170.126, subd. (g); 1170.18, subd. (b).)\n\n       In addition, the court in Garcia, supra, 230 Cal.App.4th 763, emphasized that\n\n\"unreasonable risk of danger to public safety did not have to be defined with\n\nmathematical precision to avoid being unconstitutionally vague. The court explained:\n\n          \"The critical inquiry, however, is not whether the risk is quantifiable,\n          but rather, whether the risk would be 'unreasonable.' [Citation.]\n          ' \"The law is replete with instances in which a person must, at his\n          peril, govern his conduct by such nonmathematical standards as\n          'reasonable,' 'prudent,' 'necessary and proper,' 'substantial,' and the\n\n                                             19\n\f          like. Indeed, a wide spectrum of human activities is regulated by\n          such terms: thus one man may be given a speeding ticket if he\n          overestimates the 'reasonable or prudent' speed to drive his car in the\n          circumstances [citation], while another may be incarcerated in state\n          prison on a conviction of willful homicide if he misjudges the\n          'reasonable' amount of force he may use in repelling an assault\n          [citation]. As the Supreme Court stated in Go–Bart Importing Co. v.\n          United States (1931) 282 U.S. 344, 357 . . . , 'There is no formula for\n          the determination of reasonableness.' Yet standards of this kind are\n          not impermissively vague, provided their meaning can be objectively\n          ascertained by reference to common experiences of mankind.\" ' \"\n          (Garcia, supra, at pp. 769-770.)\n\n       Similarly, in Flores, supra, 237 Cal.App.4th 1070, the court determined that the\n\nword \"unreasonable\" as used in the phrase \"pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety\" in section 1170.126, subdivision (f) was not impermissibly vague. (Flores, supra,\n\nat p. 1074.) The court reasoned, \"[s]urely a superior court judge is capable of exercising\n\ndiscretion, justly applying the public safety exception and determining whether a lesser\n\nsentence would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to public safety.\" (Id. at p. 1075.)\n\n       In his reply brief,4 Jimenez argues that we should not follow Garcia, supra, 230\n\nCal.App.4th 763 or Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th 1070 because they concern a different\n\nstatute. We are not persuaded. Instead, we find the reasoning in both Garcia and Flores\n\ninstructive. The challenged language in section 1170.18, subdivision (b) is identical to\n\nthe language challenged in Garcia and Flores except the language in the former is more\n\nspecific. The phrase \"unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\" in section 1170.18.\n\nsubdivision (b) is further defined in section 1170.18, subdivision (c). (See § 1170.18,\n\n\n\n4      Jimenez did not cite or discuss Garcia, supra, 230 Cal.App.4th 763 or Flores,\nsupra, 227 Cal.App.4th 1070 in his opening brief.\n                                            20\n\fsubdivision (c) [\"As used throughout this Code, 'unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety' means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony\n\nwithin the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e)\n\nof Section 667.\"].) As such, we follow Garcia and Flores to conclude section 1170.18,\n\nsubdivision (b) is not unconstitutionally vague. It provides the superior court with\n\nspecific criteria to consider and further instructs the court that to find a petitioner an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, it must determine that there exists an\n\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a super strike. Such a task is well\n\nwithin the capability of a superior court judge. (See Flores, supra, at p. 1075.)\n\n       We also are not swayed by Jimenez's reliance on Johnson v. United States (2015)\n\n576 U.S. ___; 135 S.Ct. 2551 (Johnson). That case addressed whether the residual clause\n\nof the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA; 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)), violated\n\nthe Constitution's prohibition of vague criminal laws. Under the ACCA, a defendant\n\nconvicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm faces more severe punishment if he\n\nhas \"three or more previous convictions for a 'violent felony,' a term defined to include\n\nany felony that 'involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury\n\nto another.' \"5 (Johnson, supra, at p. 2555; italics added.) The italicized words of this\n\n\n\n\n5        The ACCA defines \"violent felony\" as follows: \"any crime punishable by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . that -- [¶] (i) has as an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or [¶]\n(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves\nconduct that presents a serious injury to another.\" (18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B).)\n                                              21\n\fdefinition have come to be known as the ACCA's residual clause. (Johnson, supra, at\n\np. 2556.)\n\n       The United States Supreme Court determined that the ACCA's residual clause was\n\nunconstitutionally vague. It observed that the \"indeterminacy of the wide-ranging inquiry\n\nrequired by the residual clause both denies fair notice to defendants and invites arbitrary\n\nenforcement by judges.\" (Johnson, supra, 135 S.Ct. at p. 2557.)\n\n       The court was troubled that the residual clause left \"grave uncertainty about how\n\nto estimate the risk posed by a crime.\" (Johnson, supra, 135 S.Ct. at p. 2557.) The court\n\nalso was bothered that the residual clause left \"uncertainty about how much risk it takes\n\nfor a crime to qualify as a violent felony.\" (Id. at p. 2558.) The court commented, \"It is\n\none thing to apply an imprecise 'serious potential risk' standard to real-world facts; it is\n\nquite another to apply it to a judge-imagined abstraction.\" (Ibid.)\n\n       None of the concerns plaguing the court in Johnson, supra, 135 S.Ct. 1551 are\n\npresent here. Importantly, while the ACCA could increase a defendant's sentence, the\n\nAct operates to reduce a sentence. The ACCA allows federal courts to punish certain\n\ndefendants more harshly. Indeed, the Supreme Court was especially concerned about the\n\npotential to increase a defendant's sentence under the ACCA. The court held that\n\n\"[i]ncreasing a defendant's sentence under the [residual] clause denies due process of\n\nlaw.\" (Johnson, supra, at p. 2557.) Here, the Act does not involve the potential to\n\nincrease a defendant's punishment. To the contrary, the Act operates to potentially lower\n\na defendant's sentence that was found proper and warranted under the existing law.\n\nTherefore, in the instant matter, the superior court did not increase Jimenez's sentence.\n\n                                              22\n\fInstead, the court merely determined that the sentence should not be shortened.\n\nMoreover, unlike the appellant in Johnson, Jimenez does not argue that he was\n\nimproperly sentenced in the first instance. Based on this critical distinction alone, we\n\nfind Johnson unhelpful in the instant matter.6\n\n       Moreover, the Act does not require a court to estimate the risk associated with a\n\ncrime in the abstract or to determine how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a\n\nviolent crime. Instead, section 1170.18, subdivisions (b) and (c) inform the court that it\n\nmust determine whether petitioner is an \"unreasonable risk\" to commit a super strike if\n\nresentenced to a lesser sentence based on certain criteria. Simply put, the Act does not\n\ninvite arbitrary enforcement as the Supreme Court determined the ACCA did. Johnson,\n\nsupra, 135 S.Ct. 2551 does not support Jimenez's position.\n\n       As part of Jimenez's constitutional challenge to section 1170.18, subdivision (b),\n\nhe urges this court to judicially construe the subdivision to require the People to prove a\n\npetitioner is an \"unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\" by clear and convincing\n\nevidence. He contends this requirement is necessary to save subdivision (b) from being\n\nunconstitutionally vague. Because we determine the challenged subdivision is not\n\nunconstitutionally vague, we need not address this issue. That said, we find nothing in\n\nthe Act or any authority construing the Act that suggests that the People's burden of\n\n\n6      In addition, the United States Supreme Court was concerned that the ACCA's\nresidual clause denies fair notice regarding what conduct a defendant needs to avoid.\n(See Johnson, supra, 135 S.Ct. at p. 2557.) In other words, the residual clause leaves\ndefendants to guess at what conduct could result in more severe sentences. Here, there is\nno analogous concern under the Act where a defendant is not subject to a more severe\nsentence based on a vague statute.\n                                             23\n\fproving a defendant an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety would require\n\nanything more than proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n                                    DISPOSITION\n\n      The order is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                HUFFMAN, Acting P.

(Super. Ct. No. SCS272077)\n\nESTEBAN JIMENEZ,\n\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL from a postjudgment order of the Superior Court of San Diego County,\n\nDavid J. Danielsen, Judge. Affirmed.\n\n         Kevin D. Sheehy, under appointment by the Court of Appeal, for Defendant and\n\nAppellant.\n\n         Kamala D. Harris, Attorney General, Gerald A. Engler, Chief Assistant Attorney\n\nGeneral, Julie L. Garland, Assistant Attorney General, Charles C. Ragland, Scott C.\n\nTaylor and Paige B. Hazard, Deputy Attorneys General, for Plaintiff and Respondent.\n\n         On November 4, 2014, the voters enacted Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods\n\nand Schools Act (the Act), which went into effect the next day. (Cal. Const., art. II, § 10,\n\fsubd. (a).) In this case, we are asked to interpret a portion of Penal Code1 section\n\n1170.18, a new sentencing provision created by the Act.\n\n       Under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), \"[a] person currently serving a sentence\n\nfor a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been\n\nguilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section had this act been in effect at\n\nthe time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that\n\nentered the judgment of conviction in his or her case\" and request resentencing. Here,\n\nEsteban Jimenez filed a motion to be resentenced under section 1170.18, subdivision (a).\n\nThere is no dispute that Jimenez satisfies the criteria under that subdivision. However,\n\nthe superior court declined to resentence Jimenez because it determined that Jimenez\n\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See § 1170.18, subd. (b).)\n\nJimenez challenges that determination.\n\n       Jimenez contends the superior court misconstrued the unreasonable risk of danger\n\nto public safety \"test\" and that, considering the correct interpretation of that test,\n\nJimenez's circumstances do not support any determination that he would be an\n\nunreasonable risk to public safety under section 1170.18, subdivision (b). In the\n\nalternative, Jimenez maintains that section 1170, subdivision (b) is unconstitutionally\n\nvague and violates his federal due process rights.\n\n       Jimenez's contentions present an issue of first impression. Neither party has cited\n\nany authority that has interpreted section 1170, subdivision (b). Our independent\n\n\n\n1      Statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.\n                                               2\n\fresearch has not found any as well. We are aware that multiple cases involving the Act\n\nare currently pending before our high court. However, none of these cases involve the\n\nprecise issue before us, but it is possible that those cases could impact the instant matter\n\nin some way. We thus proceed cautiously with this case and look forward to the\n\nSupreme Court's guidance on the Act in the near future.\n\n          We determine that there is no merit to Jimenez's challenge to the Act. We\n\nconclude the superior court properly applied section 1170.18, subdivision (b) to Jimenez\n\nand did not abuse its discretion in finding that he was not eligible for resentencing\n\nbecause he was an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Likewise, Jimenez's\n\nconstitutional attack on the Act fares no better. The language the voters approved in\n\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (b), namely the unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\n\nis similar to language in other statutes and has been used in a variety of circumstances\n\nunder California law. We therefore determine that section 1170.18, subdivision (b) is not\n\nunconstitutionally vague and Jimenez's due process challenge fails. Accordingly, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n          On May 9, 2014, police officers recognized Jimenez in the passenger seat of his\n\ngirlfriend's car and conducted a stop because they knew a warrant had been issued for his\n\narrest due to a parole violation. The occupants were ordered to place their hands outside\n\nthe car, but twice Jimenez pulled his hands back into the car. An officer observed\n\nJimenez throw three small bindles of marijuana, methamphetamine, and heroin out of the\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fwindow. Jimenez's girlfriend was in the driver's seat and her three-year-old son was in\n\nthe back seat of the car.\n\n       On May 14, 2014, the San Diego County District Attorney's Office charged\n\nJimenez with two counts of possession of a controlled substance (Health & Saf. Code,\n\n§§ 11350, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a)). It was further alleged that he had one prior strike\n\nconviction (§§ 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, 668), three prison priors (§§ 667.5, subd. (b),\n\n668), and four probation denial prior felony convictions (§ 1203, subd. (e)(4)).\n\n       On July 25, 2014, Jimenez pled guilty to both counts and admitted all prior\n\nconviction allegations.\n\n       On August 21, 2014, Jimenez was sentenced to 32 months in prison. The sentence\n\nincluded a concurrent low term of 16 months for each count, doubled due to the prior\n\nstrike conviction. The court struck the other prior allegations for purposes of sentencing.\n\n       On November 17, 2014, Jimenez filed a petition for recall of sentence under the\n\nAct. In support of his petition, Jimenez presented evidence of the education program he\n\ncompleted and a letter of support from his fiancé, explaining that Jimenez is needed at\n\nhome to help raise their children. The petition stated Jimenez had been employed in\n\nprison, was motivated to take care of his family, and had not sustained a parole violation\n\nsince July 15, 2011.\n\n       In opposition to the petition, the People agreed that Jimenez was eligible for relief\n\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (i)), but argued that he posed an unreasonable risk of committing one of\n\nthe enumerated \"super strikes\" (§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv)). Specifically, the People\n\nargued that he would commit attempted murder. In support of their argument, the\n\n                                             4\n\fPeople described Jimenez as a \"gangster\" whose history \"is replete with ties to his gang,\n\nthe use and possession of weapons, and bloodshed.\"\n\n       The People also emphasized Jimenez's criminal history. Jimenez had a strike\n\nconviction for assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)), which stemmed from a\n\nFebruary 5, 2012, incident when Jimenez approached a stranger and \"stabbed the victim\n\nin the abdomen for no apparent reason.\" The wound was an inch deep and spanned two\n\nto three inches of the victim's torso. When the victim attempted to defend himself, two of\n\nJimenez's fellow gang members attacked the victim while yelling their gang's name, \"Old\n\nTown National City.\" As a result, Jimenez was charged with attempted murder (§§ 187,\n\nsubd. (a), 664) and assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)). It was alleged he\n\ncommitted the crimes to benefit his gang (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)), and that the crimes\n\nwere serious felonies (§ 1192.7, subds. (c)(8) & (c)(23)). Ultimately, Jimenez pled guilty\n\nto assault with a deadly weapon and the serious felony allegation (§ 1192.7, subd.\n\n(c)(23)), and was sentenced to four years in prison. He later violated the terms of his\n\nparole in that case.\n\n       The People also presented evidence that Jimenez had an extensive adult criminal\n\nhistory leading up to the strike offense: a prison prior in 2009 (§ 4502, subd. (b)),\n\nmanufacture of a dirk or dagger in prison (after two prisoners attacked a third inmate by\n\nstabbing him 16 times, Jimenez recovered the weapon, ran to the bathroom and flushed\n\nit); another prison prior in 2009 (§ 12022, subd. (a)(1)), possession of brass knuckles\n\n(police conducting a probation compliance search saw Jimenez throw a loaded syringe\n\nonto the floor and crawl out the bedroom window while in possession of brass knuckles);\n\n                                              5\n\fpossession of ammunition by a prohibited person in 2006 (§ 12316, subd. (b)(1));\n\ncontempt of court in 2006 (§ 166, subd. (a)(4); Jimenez was found with two other\n\ndocumented gang members and thus found in violation of a court-ordered gang\n\ninjunction); a prison prior in 2005 (Veh. Code, § 10851, subd. (a), taking a vehicle\n\nwithout consent (Jimenez was found driving a stolen truck)); possession of a controlled\n\nsubstance in 2005 (Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)); possession of less than an\n\nounce of marijuana in 2004 (Health & Saf. Code, § 11357, subd. (b)).\n\n       The People also noted that Jimenez violated probation or parole in every case in\n\nwhich he was placed under supervision. For his 2005 prison prior, Jimenez's probation\n\nwas revoked six times before he was placed on parole in 2007, and he violated the terms\n\nof his parole in 2009. He violated parole on his 2009 convictions as late as September\n\n2011 and violated parole on his strike conviction in May 2014.\n\n       The People maintained Jimenez had a violent adult record while in prison. Aside\n\nfrom the 2009 incident involving him disposing of a slashing weapon after an attack on\n\nan inmate, Jimenez was administratively disciplined in 2008 for physically attacking\n\nanother inmate. Four months earlier, Jimenez was disciplined after attacking an inmate\n\non the basketball court. Finally, in September 2007, Jimenez was placed in\n\nadministrative segregation after attacking an inmate because the disciplinary committee\n\nconcluded that \" 'release to the general population at this time would jeopardize the safety\n\nand security of the institution.' \"\n\n       Jimenez's criminal behavior began as a juvenile. In February 2002, as a teenager,\n\na true finding was made that Jimenez committed vandalism (§ 594, subds. (a) &\n\n                                             6\n\f(b)(2)(A)) after he tagged his gang's name and moniker on a park wall. In May 2002, a\n\ntrue finding was made that he committed second degree burglary (§ 459). In October\n\n2001, Jimenez brandished a metal pipe at a man and threatened to strike the victim if he\n\ndid not give him his wallet. Though Jimenez did not strike the victim with the pipe, the\n\nvictim was punched in the face (by either Jimenez or the juvenile with him). As a result,\n\nJimenez was convicted of attempted robbery and sentenced to various terms including\n\ngang conditions.\n\n       The People asserted that Jimenez's violent behavior as a teenager continued when\n\nin custody. For example, in 2002, he was disciplined several times: fighting (May, July\n\nand Aug. 2002), gang-related fighting (May and Oct. 2002), and killing a bird (Aug.\n\n2002). Jimenez claimed to have joined the Old Town National City gang at age 10. He\n\nalso started drinking alcohol at that time. He began using marijuana a year later.\n\n       Additionally, the People highlighted criminal activity that did not result in a\n\nconviction. In 2005 when on parole, Jimenez jumped from a car after it was pursued and\n\nran from police. Also in 2005, Jimenez was stopped by officers while riding a bicycle\n\nand admitted smoking methamphetamine that day. In 2002, officers stopped a car after a\n\nbottle was thrown from the car at a passing motorist. Sixteen-year-old Jimenez was in\n\nthe car and so intoxicated he could not walk without assistance.\n\n       The court held a hearing on Jimenez's petition. At the hearing, Jimenez's attorney\n\nattempted to minimize Jimenez's previous criminal activity, arguing that Jimenez was not\n\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       At the hearing, the superior court considered Jimenez's petition, the People's\n\nopposition, the defense's brief in support of the petition, and the probation officer's report\n\nprepared for the original sentencing. Noting the high standard set for any court to\n\ndisqualify a person from the Act's benefits, the court explained it was the People's burden\n\nto prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Jimenez posed an unreasonable risk.\n\nThe court defined an unreasonable risk as a \"demonstrated [] substantial danger, a serious\n\nand well-founded risk, that the individual will commit super strike crimes\" if released.\n\nThe court explained that a chance or mere possibility that Jimenez would commit an\n\nenumerated offense would not satisfy the standard.\n\n       The court ultimately denied the petition as follows:\n\n          \"Mr. Jimenez is an individual who has yet to enjoy his 30th birthday\n          that's coming up shortly. In his short life, commencing as a juvenile,\n          he has shown a propensity for persistent criminality. Consistent with\n          that criminality there is also a consistent or persistent use of force\n          with violence that is characteristic of his interactions when free in\n          the community, and ironically it does not seem to be abated by\n          incarceration. In fact, it is more pronounced as being his means of\n          expressing himself. [¶] In addition to the persistent criminality and\n          persistent use of violence, there are two significant events in his life\n          that this court deems to be extremely important. One was he did\n          utilize a knife on another human being resulting in serious injuries\n          for which he was convicted. In addition, during his time in the\n          institution, he participated in a stabbing incident. It is noted that his\n          participation is somewhat limited, but he did participate, took the\n          stabbing instrument attempting to dispose of it to protect those that\n          were utilizing it. [¶] On balance, Mr. Jimenez is an individual that\n          this court is convinced that he is likely to engage in violence with a\n          weapon if free in the community. The court deems his record, as I\n          review it in totality, as one which does present a substantial danger\n          and serious well-founded risk that he would likely commit a super\n          strike if free in the community. That risk of danger is unreasonable\n          under the circumstances and the petition accordingly is denied.\"\n\n\n                                              8\n\f       Jimenez timely appealed.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n       \"Proposition 47 'was intended to reduce penalties \"for certain nonserious and\n\nnonviolent property and drug offenses from wobblers or felonies to misdemeanors.\" ' \"\n\n(T.W. v.

As such, we\n\nneed not interpret that subdivision. Instead, we focus on subdivisions (b) and (c).\n\n       Section 1170.18, subdivision (b) sets forth the criteria for the superior court to\n\nconsider, in its discretion, to determine whether a petitioner is an unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety. The factors are as follows:\n\n           \"(1) The petitioner's criminal conviction history, including the type\n           of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of\n           prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes.\n\n           \"(2) The petitioner's disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation\n           while incarcerated.\n\n           \"(3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines\n           to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an\n           unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\" (§ 1170.18, subd.\n           (b)(1)-(3).)\n\n       In addition, section 1170.18, subdivision (c) further defines \"unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety\" as \"an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new\"\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fsuper strike offense, such as murder, rape, or child molestation. (§§ 1170.18, subd. (c);\n\n667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv).)2\n\n       Here, Jimenez contends the superior court erred in two ways. First, he asserts the\n\ncourt misconstrued the unreasonable risk test found in section 1170.18, subdivision (b),\n\nand as such, applied the wrong test. Specifically, he claims the court applied a test based\n\non \"an unrelated statutory standard applicable only to sexually violent predators.\"\n\nSecond, Jimenez maintains that his circumstances do not support that he is an\n\nunreasonable risk under the correct test. We reject both of these contentions.\n\n       As a threshold matter, we note that the plain language of section 1170.18,\n\nsubdivision (b) calls for an exercise of the sentencing court's discretion. \" 'Discretion is\n\nthe power to make the decision, one way or the other.' \" (People v.

For example, in considering Jimenez's petition under the\n\nAct, the superior court explained: \"In my judgment, the type of risk that is an\n\nunreasonable risk can only be presented to the court when there is demonstrated a\n\nsubstantial danger, a serious and well-founded risk, that the individual will commit super\n\nstrike crimes if free in the community.\" Jimenez points out that appellate courts,\n\nincluding our Supreme Court, have used the terms \"substantial danger\" and \"serious and\n\nwell-founded risk\" in construing portions of the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA,\n\nWelf. & Inst. Code, § 6600 et seq.). He is correct. (See People v. Superior Court\n\n(Ghilotti) (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2543849\"><a href=\"/opinion/2543849/people-v-superior-court-ghilotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 922 (Ghilotti).) Nevertheless, the fact that the superior\n\ncourt used such language is not of the moment.\n\n       In Ghilotti, our high court interpreted the phrase \"likely to engage in acts of sexual\n\nviolence\" as used in Welfare and Institutions Code section 6601, subdivision (d). In\n\ndoing so, the court found that phrase \"connotes much more than the mere possibility that\n\nthe person will reoffend as a result of a predisposing mental disorder that seriously\n\nimpairs volitional control. On the other hand, the statute does not require a precise\n\ndetermination that the chance of reoffense is better than even. Instead, an evaluator\n\napplying this standard must conclude that the person is 'likely' to reoffend if, because of a\n\ncurrent mental disorder which makes it difficult or impossible to restrain violent sexual\n\n                                             13\n\fbehavior, the person presents a substantial danger, that is, a serious and well-founded\n\nrisk, that he or she will commit such crimes if free in the community.\" (Ghilotti, supra,\n\n27 Cal.4th at p. 922, original italics.) Also, the court made clear that it was not persuaded\n\n\"that a valid involuntary commitment law requires proof that the person is more likely\n\nthan not to reoffend.\" (Id. at p. 923, original italics.)\n\n       Jimenez contends the superior court's use of the SVPA to interpret unreasonable\n\nrisk of danger to public safety under the Act was improper for two reasons. First,\n\nJimenez emphasizes the purpose of the SVPA is to \"fill up state institutional spaces (i.e.,\n\nstate hospitals) with certain identified violent sex offenders\" while, in contrast, the Act's\n\npurpose is to \"free up state institutional spaces . . . now occupied by nonserious,\n\nnonviolent felons who should be treated as misdemeanants and released sooner rather\n\nthan later from incarceration.\" Although we do not quibble with Jimenez's description of\n\nthe Act's purpose (see T.W. v. Superior Court, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 652), the\n\nportion of the Act at issue, section 1170.18, subdivision (b), provides the court with the\n\ndiscretion to conclude that a petitioner, who otherwise qualifies to have his sentence\n\nreduced under the Act, should not be released earlier because he or she would pose an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See §1170.18, subd. (b).) In other words,\n\nthe portion of the Act Jimenez challenges here, much like Welfare and Institutions Code\n\nsection 6601, subdivision (d), provides a standard by which a court must evaluate a\n\ndefendant to determine if he or she poses a certain type of danger to society. As such, we\n\nare not troubled that the superior court invoked the terms \"substantial danger\" and\n\n\"serious and well-founded risk\" in denying Jimenez's petition under the Act.\n\n                                               14\n\f       Second, Jimenez maintains that by using the SVPA as a guide to interpret section\n\n1170.18, subdivision (b)'s \"unreasonable risk\" language, the court \"set[] a significantly\n\nlower bar . . . to exclude a large group of eligible people from the benefits of\n\nmisdemeanor resentencing than the Act intends.\" To this end, Jimenez asserts that\n\n\"unreasonable\" means, in \"everyday usage,\" \"excessive\" or \"immoderate.\" Armed with\n\nthis definition, Jimenez concludes, \"[c]ommonsensically, a risk that something is less\n\nlikely to occur than not cannot be called an excessive or immoderate risk by any stretch\n\nof the imagination.\" Essentially, Jimenez argues that the phrase \"unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety,\" as used in section 1170.18, subdivision (b), requires a court to\n\nfind that a petitioner is more likely than not to commit a super strike if released early.\n\nWe find no support for this urged interpretation.\n\n       The Act does not create the phrase \"unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\"\n\nout of whole cloth. This same phrase can be found in section 1170.126, subdivision (f) as\n\nadded by the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012. That subdivision gives a court\n\ndiscretion to deny a petition for resentencing under the Three Strikes Reform Act if the\n\ncourt \"determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety.\" (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).)\n\n       We observe \"it has long been settled that '[t]he enacting body is deemed to be\n\naware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is\n\nenacted' [citation], 'and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof' [citation].\n\n'This principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative.' \" (People v.

Thus, we presume voters were aware \"unreasonable risk of danger to\n\npublic safety,\" as used in section 1170.126, subdivision (f), had been judicially construed\n\nas not being impermissibly vague, but as nevertheless having no fixed definition.3 (See\n\nPeople v.

They did not. We\n\ncannot read into a statute qualifications or modifications that will materially affect its\n\noperation as to conform to a supposed intention not expressed by the voters. (See Taylor\n\nv. McKay (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(See In re Shaputis, supra,\n\n53 Cal.4th at p. 219; Garcia, supra, 230 Cal.App.4th at pp. 769-770; Flores, supra, 227\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1075.) The Act merely asks the court to make a dangerousness\n\ndetermination. A dangerousness determination is a factual inquiry guided by a superior\n\ncourt's review of certain enumerated criteria. Under the Act, the court must determine\n\n\n\n3       In addition, similar language is found elsewhere in California law. For example,\nin reviewing a decision by the California Board of Parole to deny a prisoner parole, an\nappellate court considers only \"whether some evidence supports the ultimate conclusion\nthat the inmate poses an unreasonable risk to public safety if released.\" (In re Shaputis\n(2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844231\"><a href=\"/opinion/844231/in-re-shaputis/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219.) Jimenez has not provided us with any authority wherein the\nunreasonable risk within the parole context requires a more likely than not finding of\ndangerousness. Our independent research has not uncovered any either.\n                                              16\n\fwhether an unreasonable risk exists that the petitioner will commit a new super strike\n\noffense, such as murder, rape, or child molestation, if he is released from prison early.\n\n(§ 1170.18, subds. (b), (c).) Further, the Act specifically tells the court what factors to\n\nconsider. (See § 1170.18, subd. (b).) There is no indication in the record, and Jimenez\n\nhas not persuaded us otherwise, that the superior court did not consider the appropriate\n\nfactors. And the fact that the court, here, in making the dangerousness determination,\n\nsaid certain words that have been used in the SVPA context does not mean that it applied\n\nthe wrong test.\n\n       Having concluded that the superior court did not apply the wrong test, we next\n\nanalyze whether the court abused its discretion in finding Jimenez was not eligible for\n\nresentencing under the Act because he posed an unreasonable risk of danger. We\n\nconclude the court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n       Jimenez possesses a long criminal history marked with violence. He joined a\n\ncriminal street gang at age 10. He, while armed with a metal pipe, attempted to rob a\n\nperson. He stabbed a person in the stomach with a knife, was charged with attempted\n\nmurder, and ultimately pled guilty to assault with a deadly weapon, serving four years in\n\nprison. During his prison sentence, Jimenez flushed a stabbing weapon down the toilet\n\nthat had been used to stab another inmate 16 times.\n\n       While incarcerated, Jimenez has a history of physical violence, including three\n\nattacks on other inmates. Even as a juvenile, Jimenez's time in custody was littered with\n\nvarious acts of physical violence, such as fighting and killing a bird.\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f       Despite multiple instances of physical violence, Jimenez nevertheless maintains\n\nthat the superior court's finding that he was an unreasonable risk to commit a super strike\n\nconstituted an abuse of discretion because he has never been convicted of a specific intent\n\ncrime. However, there is no such required finding under the Act. Instead, section\n\n1170.18, subdivision (b) tasks the superior court with determining whether a petitioner is\n\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety by considering the petitioner's criminal\n\nhistory, disciplinary record while incarcerated, and any other relevant evidence.\n\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (b).) There is nothing that requires a petitioner to have been convicted\n\nof or pled guilty to a specific intent crime.\n\n       In short, we are satisfied that the superior court's finding that resentencing Jimenez\n\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety was not arbitrary, irrational,\n\nor capricious. The court therefore did not abuse its discretion.\n\n       Jimenez next challenges the Act on constitutional grounds. He insists that section\n\n1170.18, subdivision (b), specifically the phrase \"unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety\" is unconstitutionally vague, and thus, violates his federal due process rights. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n       \"The constitutional interest implicated in questions of statutory vagueness is that\n\nno person be deprived of 'life, liberty, or property without due process of law,' as assured\n\nby both the federal Constitution [citation] and the California Constitution [citation].)\"\n\n(Williams v. Garcetti (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1245228\"><a href=\"/opinion/1245228/williams-v-garcetti/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567.) The government violates this guarantee\n\nby taking away someone's life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it\n\nfails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that\n\n                                                18\n\fit invites arbitrary enforcement. (Kolender v. Lawson (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110926\"><a href=\"/opinion/110926/kolender-v-lawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357-358.)\n\n\"All presumptions and intendments favor the validity of a statute and mere doubt does\n\nnot afford sufficient reason for a judicial declaration of invalidity.

However, there are two reported cases wherein an appellant\n\nchallenged analogous language found in the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012. In\n\nGarcia, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the appellant contended that section 1170.126 was\n\nunconstitutionally vague because the term \"unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\"\n\nwas not defined. (Garcia, supra, at p. 768.) In finding that the term was not\n\nunconstitutionally vague, the court noted that the meaning of \"unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety\" is made clear by reference to examples of evidence the superior\n\ncourt could consider in making the determination. (Id. at p. 769.) The criteria set forth in\n\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f) is identical to that found in section 1170.18.,\n\nsubdivision (b). (See §§ 1170.126, subd. (g); 1170.18, subd. (b).)\n\n       In addition, the court in Garcia, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, emphasized that\n\n\"unreasonable risk of danger to public safety did not have to be defined with\n\nmathematical precision to avoid being unconstitutionally vague. The court explained:\n\n          \"The critical inquiry, however, is not whether the risk is quantifiable,\n          but rather, whether the risk would be 'unreasonable.' [Citation.]\n          ' \"The law is replete with instances in which a person must, at his\n          peril, govern his conduct by such nonmathematical standards as\n          'reasonable,' 'prudent,' 'necessary and proper,' 'substantial,' and the\n\n                                             19\n\f          like. Indeed, a wide spectrum of human activities is regulated by\n          such terms: thus one man may be given a speeding ticket if he\n          overestimates the 'reasonable or prudent' speed to drive his car in the\n          circumstances [citation], while another may be incarcerated in state\n          prison on a conviction of willful homicide if he misjudges the\n          'reasonable' amount of force he may use in repelling an assault\n          [citation]. As the Supreme Court stated in Go–Bart Importing Co. v.\n          United States (1931) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101643\"><a href=\"/opinion/101643/go-bart-importing-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357 . . . , 'There is no formula for\n          the determination of reasonableness.'

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the court determined that the\n\nword \"unreasonable\" as used in the phrase \"pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety\" in section 1170.126, subdivision (f) was not impermissibly vague. (Flores, supra,\n\nat p. 1074.) The court reasoned, \"[s]urely a superior court judge is capable of exercising\n\ndiscretion, justly applying the public safety exception and determining whether a lesser\n\nsentence would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to public safety.\" (Id. at p. 1075.)\n\n       In his reply brief,4 Jimenez argues that we should not follow Garcia, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Instead, we find the reasoning in both Garcia and Flores\n\ninstructive. The challenged language in section 1170.18, subdivision (b) is identical to\n\nthe language challenged in Garcia and Flores except the language in the former is more\n\nspecific. The phrase \"unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\" in section 1170.18.\n\nsubdivision (b) is further defined in section 1170.18, subdivision (c). (See § 1170.18,\n\n\n\n4      Jimenez did not cite or discuss Garcia, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

As such, we follow Garcia and Flores to conclude section 1170.18,\n\nsubdivision (b) is not unconstitutionally vague. It provides the superior court with\n\nspecific criteria to consider and further instructs the court that to find a petitioner an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, it must determine that there exists an\n\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a super strike. Such a task is well\n\nwithin the capability of a superior court judge. (See Flores, supra, at p. 1075.)\n\n       We also are not swayed by Jimenez's reliance on Johnson v.

That case addressed whether the residual clause\n\nof the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA; 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)), violated\n\nthe Constitution's prohibition of vague criminal laws. Under the ACCA, a defendant\n\nconvicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm faces more severe punishment if he\n\nhas \"three or more previous convictions for a 'violent felony,' a term defined to include\n\nany felony that 'involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury\n\nto another.' \"5 (Johnson, supra, at p. 2555; italics added.) The italicized words of this\n\n\n\n\n5        The ACCA defines \"violent felony\" as follows: \"any crime punishable by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . that -- [¶] (i) has as an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or [¶]\n(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves\nconduct that presents a serious injury to another.\" (18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B).)\n                                              21\n\fdefinition have come to be known as the ACCA's residual clause. (Johnson, supra, at\n\np. 2556.)\n\n       The United States Supreme Court determined that the ACCA's residual clause was\n\nunconstitutionally vague. It observed that the \"indeterminacy of the wide-ranging inquiry\n\nrequired by the residual clause both denies fair notice to defendants and invites arbitrary\n\nenforcement by judges.\" (Johnson, supra, 135 S.Ct. at p. 2557.)\n\n       The court was troubled that the residual clause left \"grave uncertainty about how\n\nto estimate the risk posed by a crime.\" (Johnson, supra, 135 S.Ct. at p. 2557.) The court\n\nalso was bothered that the residual clause left \"uncertainty about how much risk it takes\n\nfor a crime to qualify as a violent felony.\" (Id. at p. 2558.) The court commented, \"It is\n\none thing to apply an imprecise 'serious potential risk' standard to real-world facts; it is\n\nquite another to apply it to a judge-imagined abstraction.\" (Ibid.)\n\n       None of the concerns plaguing the court in Johnson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1551</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> are\n\npresent here. Importantly, while the ACCA could increase a defendant's sentence, the\n\nAct operates to reduce a sentence. The ACCA allows federal courts to punish certain\n\ndefendants more harshly. Indeed, the Supreme Court was especially concerned about the\n\npotential to increase a defendant's sentence under the ACCA. The court held that\n\n\"[i]ncreasing a defendant's sentence under the [residual] clause denies due process of\n\nlaw.\" (Johnson, supra, at p. 2557.) Here, the Act does not involve the potential to\n\nincrease a defendant's punishment. To the contrary, the Act operates to potentially lower\n\na defendant's sentence that was found proper and warranted under the existing law.\n\nTherefore, in the instant matter, the superior court did not increase Jimenez's sentence.\n\n                                              22\n\fInstead, the court merely determined that the sentence should not be shortened.\n\nMoreover, unlike the appellant in Johnson, Jimenez does not argue that he was\n\nimproperly sentenced in the first instance. Based on this critical distinction alone, we\n\nfind Johnson unhelpful in the instant matter.6\n\n       Moreover, the Act does not require a court to estimate the risk associated with a\n\ncrime in the abstract or to determine how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a\n\nviolent crime. Instead, section 1170.18, subdivisions (b) and (c) inform the court that it\n\nmust determine whether petitioner is an \"unreasonable risk\" to commit a super strike if\n\nresentenced to a lesser sentence based on certain criteria. Simply put, the Act does not\n\ninvite arbitrary enforcement as the Supreme Court determined the ACCA did.
